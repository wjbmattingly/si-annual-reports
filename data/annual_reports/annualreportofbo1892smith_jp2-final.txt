UPON

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1892,

BY
G. BROWN GOODE,

Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of U.S. National Museum.

A.—_GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

The report now presented relates to the operations of the National
Museum during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892.

The history of the origin and development of the National Museum
has been discussed in previous reports, both in the introductory pages
and in a paper published in the report. for 1891, entitled ‘‘ The Genesis
of the National Museum.”* It will therefore be sufficient for our pres-
ent purpose to repeat a few of the most essential facts.

The Smithsonian Institution was established by act of Congress in
1846. One of the provisions of the act was that all objects of art and
of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants,
and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United
States, should be placed in the custody of the Smithsonian Institution.
As one of the results of this provision, the collections, both of ethno-
logical and natural history objects, made by the numerous Government
explormg expeditions, came into the possession of the Institution.
These, with the ** National Cabinet of Curiosities,” which was exhibited
in the Patent Office building, and which was transferred to the Smith-
sonian Institution in 1858, formed an important nucleus around which
thousands of other collections have since gathered. The‘ National
Cabinet of Curiosities ” was a name given to the collections of the
‘‘ National Institution,” which was organized six years before the act
creating the Smithsonian Institution had been passed.

The National Museum thus grew up under the eare of the Smith-
soman Institution, and the Secretary of the Institution was appointed

many years, but if was not until 1879 that an appropriation was made,
providing money for the construetion of a building especially intended
for the display of the national collections. This action of Congress
had been doubtless precipitated by the large increase made in the eo!
lections of the Government at the close of the Centennial Exhibition
in 1876. The building was completed in 1881, during which year the
collections were in part transferred to it from the Smithsonian building,
In the following year a careful estimate of the extent of the collections,
including the results of Government expeditions and gifts from private
individuals, showed that the total number of specimens in the National!
Museum was 193,362. At the end of June, 1892, this total had in-
creased to 3,223,941. Thus in one decade from what was practically
the date of occupancy of the Museum building, the collections have
increased sixteenfold. This result is certainly very: gratifying. The
Museum building is, however, very much overcrowded, and a new build-
ing is urgently needed. The attention of Congress has been frequently
called to this matter, but nothing has yet been done. If the present un-
satisfactory conditions are to exist much longer, such a rate of increase
in the collections will, as has been already pointed out, become exceed-
ingly embarrassing, and instead of endeavoring to interest people in
contributing to the national collections, it will soon become necessary
to discourage them from doing so. Indeed, this policy has already
been adopted in certain instances, and the National Museum has lost
control of several large and important collections. In the case of col-
lections made by various branches of the Government, the Museum is
obliged by law to receive them, having beei appointed by Congress
the custodian of such collections. The necessity of receiving these
makes it the more incumbent to decline offers trom private sourees.

During the year the Museum has accomplished much in connection
with the preparation of an exhibit for the World’s Fair, to be opened
in Chicago next May. In this the following departments of the Museum
will be represented: Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Fishes, Insects, Marine
Invertebrates, Comparative Anatomy, Minerals, Physical Geology, Eth-
nology, American Prehistoric Pottery, Prehistoric Anthropology; as
well as several sections of the Department of Arts and Industries, viz..
Animal Products, Oriental Antiquities, Graphie Arts, and Musical
[ustruments.

The National Museum has been recognized as such by Congress for

PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF THE COLLECTIONS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

B.—SPECIAL TOPICS OF THE YEAR.
INCREASE IN THE COLLECTIONS.

During the year the collections have been increased by the addition
of more than 228,000 specimens. These are, for the most part, contri-

of the Museum. The total number of specimens now in the collections
is 3,223,941.

INCREASE IN THE MUSEUM LIBRARY.

The number of publications added to the Musenmn library during the
year was 11,892, including 695 volumes of more than 100 pages, 1.642
pamphlets, and 8,486 parts of regular serials.

DECREASED EDITION OF THE REPORTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTI-

The edition of the Report of the Smithsonian Institution, including
that of the National Museum, has been reduced by the Fifty-second
Congress to 10,000 extra copies.

VISITORS.

The number of visitors to the Museum building during the year end-
ing June 30, 1892, was 269,825, and during the same period 114,817

PROPOSED ADDITIONAL MUSEUM BUILDING.

On January 21, 1892, the bill providing for a new Museum building
was introduced in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds. It was favorably reported by this committee
February 26, and passed the Senate April 14. The bill was referred to
the same committee in the House of Representatives, but was not
reported. It has now passed the Senate three times, but has failed of
action in the House.

DEVELOPMENT AND ARRANGEMENT GF THE EXHIBITION SERIES.

The overcrowded condition of the Museum building has prevented
any extensive changes in the arrangement of the exhibition halls.
Although a large number of interesting objects has been received during
the year in almost every department, it has not been possible to place
them on exhibition. They have, therefore, for the most part been stored
away until additional facilities for exhibition purposes shall have been
obtained. This can only be brought about by the passage by Congress
of an act authorizing the construction of an additional Museum build-
ing. In spite of the many disadvantages under which the work of the
Museum has been carried on during the year, considerable progress has
been made in connection with the rearrangement of the collections on
exhibition and in preparing specimens for installation, when it has been
possible to provide the necessary space.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

The curator of the department of ethnology has continued to mount
and label new specimens, which will be held in readiness for exhibition
when practicabie. A large number of specimens of aboriginal pottery,
consisting mainly of fragments collected by the officers of the Bureau
of Ethnology in the tide-water districts of Maryland and Virginia, have
been installed. In the section of graphic arts several important gaps
have been filled. Table-cases have been placed in the alcoves to aceom-
modate new specimens, and considerable progress has been made in the
substitution of printed for written labels. Several exhibits relating to
the development of the railroad and telegraph have been added to the
collections in the section of transportation and engineering. ‘The col-
lection of birds’ eggs has been carefully rearranged and relabeled,
and new insect-proof cases have been provided. Numerous illustra-
tions have been added to the systematic series of insects, making it
nearly complete. <A large collection of vertebrate fossils, from regions
in the west, secured by Prof. O. C. Marsh, in connection with his official
work for the U.S. Geological Survey, has been placed upon exhibition.
This collection is arranged in a wall-case especially constructed for it,
extending the entire length of the east side of the exhibition hall. The
collection of Cambrian and Ordovician fossils has been completed,
labeled, and placed upon exhibition. A large collection of Mesozoic
fossils has been received from the Geological Survey, and a part of it
has been placed upon exhibition. The herbarium has been practically
rearranged. New genus covers and genus labels have been substituted
for the old ones. An entirely new arrangement of the exhibition series
of fossil plants was begun during the. year. Heretofore, the plants
have been arranged with a view to illustrating the origin and develop-
ment of plant life, but it has been found desirable to substitute for this
a geological arrangement. A large and exceedingly valuable collection
of fossil plants has been presented by Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston,
Pa., and portions of it will be placed upon exhibition as oppor-
tunity offers. A considerable portion of the exhibition series in the
department of minerals has been remounted on ebonized blocks, and
the entire collection will soon be similarly provided for. Two large
mahogany cases have been provided for the exhibition of the gems and
semi-precious stones. This collection embraces 2,215 specimens. There
have been transferred to the exhibition hall about 1,800 specimens be-
longing to the exhibition and study series, which had accumulated in
the mineral laboratory. In the department of geology considerable
time has been devoted to the installation, in the south-west court, of the
economic series, Which may now be said to be in an approximately sat-
isfactory condition. The collection of ores, tin, nickel, manganese and
antimony are systematized, and temporary labels have, in most cases,
been prepared. The laying of new pavements in the south-west court
and west-south range necessitated the moving of all the tloor-cases,
and, incidentally, the rearrangement of the specimens.

K.—REVIEW OF WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENTS.
DIVISION OF ANTHROPOLOGY.
ETHNOLOGY.

The work in this department for the past year has been chiefly con-
fined to the preparation of an exhibit for the World’s Columbian
Exposition. After consultation, it was decided to unite the work of
the Bureau of Ethnology, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, with that of the Department of Ethnology in the National Museum.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15

Several valuable contributions to the collections were received dur-
ing the year. From the Cocopa, Yaki, Yuma, Papago, and other tribes
of Sonora, Mexico, and Lower California, Mr. Edward Palmer collected
for the Museum objects illustrating the industries of these tribes. Val-
uable material was also received from Mr. R. W. Bartleman, United
States legation, Caracas, Venezuela; Prof. Henry H. Giglioli, director
of the Royal Zodlogical Museum, Florence, Italy; Hon. Rounsevelle
Wildman, United States consul at Singapore, India; Prof. I. C. Rus-
sell, U. S. Geological Survey; Lieut. G. B. Harber, U. 8S. Navy, and
Mr. J. Walter Fewkes, Cambridge, Mass. The number of specimens
received during the year was 2,241, and the number of catalogue entries
1,243.

PREHISTORIC ANTITROPOLOGY.

The curator, Dr. Thomas Wilson, has continued his investigations of
the evidences of the remote antiquity of man in America, and in this
connection has made a special study of arrow-heads and spear-heads, or
knives. He was ealled upon to prepare exhibits for the Madrid Exposi-
tion and also for the World’s Columbian Exposition.

About 10,000 specimens were added to the collections of this depart-
ment during the year. The principal collections were received from
Edward Palmer; the Royal Zodlogical Museum, Florence, Italy; the
National Museum of Anthropology and Ethnology, Florence, Italy;
A. ©. Carlisle, De Witt Webb, the Bureau of Ethnology, Edward
Lovett, Henry Balfour, and others.

ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES.

This section is devoted to biblical archeology, and to the archeology,
history, languages, arts and religions of the people of western Asia
and Egypt, and is under the immediate charge of Dr. Cyrus Adler, as
assistant curator. During Dr. Adler’s recent visit to the east, in the
interests of the World’s Columbian Exposition, he obtained several
interesting objects. Two carefully made and well-preserved paper
molds of a piece of sculpture and a cuneiform inscription from Persep-
olis, have been received through the Department of State, from the
Hon. Truxton Beale, United States minister to Persia. The Telfair
Academy of Arts and Scienees of Savannah, Ga., has deposited a
portion of the collection of oriental books and manuscripts owned by
the late William Bb. Hodgson.

GRAPHIC ARTS.

The mest important additions of the year, as reported by Mr. 8. R.
Koehler, curator, are the illustrations of the half-tone relief screen-
process, and of a variety of the photo-aquatint intaglio process. — Inter-
esting specimens illustrating the advances made in chromo-collographie
process-work were given by Mr. EK. Bierstadt, of New York, and by the
16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

J.B. Lippincott Company, of Philadelphia, About 200 specimens were
added during the year, the catalogue entries numbering 179,

FORESTRY.

Dr. B. E. Fernow, honorary curator, reports that the forestry collee-
tion has not received many additions during the year, The lack of
space for exhibition purposes has restricted his efforts toward develop-
ing the collection, and the bulkiness of the material makes if undesiva-
ble to add to itin the storage-rooms. The curator has, during the year,
prepared for publication: a list, with notes, of all the species of trees
found in the parks of Washington, D. ©.

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL POTTERY.

The operations of this department, as reported by Mr, Willian H.
Holines, honorary curator, consisted in the installation of a number of
specimens from the tide-water districts of Maryland and Virginia, and
the Gila Valley, Arizona. Among the principal contributions were
fragments of ancient Pueblo ware from Arizona, received from the U.S.
Geological Survey, and earthen vessels from Guadalajara, Mexico,
collected by Capt. John G. Bourke, U.S. Army. The estimated nun-
ber of specimens received during the year was 1,517,

PRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING.

Satisfactory progress is reported by the curator, Mr. J. EK. Watkins,
The accessions during the year are both valuable and interesting. They
include, among other things, an electrical locomotive, which made a
speed of 120 miles an hour at Laurel, Md., in 1889. The value of the
collection of telegraphic apparatus has been greatly enhanced through
the codperation of Mr. George C. Maynard, secretary of the American
Association of Inventors and Manufacturers. The collection showing
the development of the typewriting machine has also received several
important additions. Messrs. Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict have de-
posited a model of the Sholes & Glidden typewriter, invented in 1867,
and the original machine made trom this model. Mr. J.T. Richards,
assistant chief engineer of the Pennsylvania Railroad, presented a
model of the monument erected at Bordentown, N. J. in 1591, to com-
memorate the first movement by steam on a railroad in the State of
New Jersey, which occurred on November 12, 1831. Miss Katherine
Parsons, of Washington, deposited a sedan chair decorated with gold,
owned and used by the reyal family of France during the reign of Louis
x1v. The number of specimens received during the year was 265, the
catalogue entries numbering 161.

FOODS.

Prof. W. O. Atwater, the honorary curator, while in Europe during
the past fiscal year, spent considerable time in collating data available
for use in preparing labels, charts, diagrams, and plans for the food
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 17

collection in the National Museum. With this object in view he con-
ferred with a number of experts and investigators and visited museums
in which food collections are to be found. His recent study of the sub-
ject has strengthened his belief in the practicability of developing the
collection in the National Museum in such a manner as to make it of
ereat popular interest, to say nothing of its educational and scientific
value.

MATERIA MEDICA.

Dr. William 8S. Dixon, U.S. Navy, who assumed charge of this see-
tion in October, 1891, as honorary curator, states that the labeling of
the collection has been completed. The estimated number of specimens
received during the year was 207, the larger portion of which was from
the Royal Gardens at Kew, England. The catalogue entries numbered
55

DIVISION OF ZOOLOGY.

MAMMALS.

Mr. Frederick W. True, curator, states that the work in this depart-
ment has been seriously arrested by the necessary preparations for the
exhibit at the World’s Columbian Exposition.

Many foreign and domestic mammals were obtained from various
sources. Dr. W. L. Abbott sent a valuable collection of East African
mammals, and Mr. William Astor Chanler presented two excellent
mounted heads of giraffes from the same locality. Dr. Edgar A. Mearns,
U.S. Army, of the Mexican Boundary Commission, has sent in some
finely prepared specimens from the border. The President of the
United States deposited an armadillo which had been sent to him by
Mr. R. R. Skaggs, of Breckenridge, Tex. More than fifty mammals
were received from the National Zoélogical Park. The estimated num-
ber of specimens received during the year was 1,086.

BIRDS.

This department, under the charge of Mr. Robert Ridgway, as cura-
tor, shows a gratifying growth during the past year. The work of
transferring the specimens in the study collection to new trays and
‘vabinets has been vigorously pushed. The preparation of an exhibit of
birds for the World’s Columbian Exposition occupied a large share of
the curator’s time. The present state of the collection is more satis-
factory than during the preceding year, the arrangement of the speci-
mens being better adapted for the convenience of visitors. The esti-
mated number of specimens added was 5,610, involving 5,609 catalogue
entries.

BIRDS’ EGGS.

The honorary curator, Capt. Charles E. Bendire, U. S. Army, re-
ports that the collections are in excellent shape, having been carefully
overhauled and relabeled. The most important contribution during

18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

the year was made by Dr. William L. Ralph, of New York, consisting
of 1,630 eggs and 100 nests, several of the species being new to the
Museum collection. This is the most valuable ‘gift which has been
made to this collection for several years. In view of the large number
and great value of the contributions made by Dr. Ralph to the collec-
tion of birds’ eggs in the National Museum, it is understood that this
collection will not be drawn upon for purposes of exchange or dona-
tion. and that it will form an integral part of the national collection of
birds’ eggs. A number of specimens, gathered in the Death Valley
region of southern California, were received from the Department of
Agriculture. There were received during the year 3,094 specimens,
involving 840 catalogue entries.
REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS.

The curator, Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, reports that satisfactory pro-
gress has been made during the year. The work of installing, identi-
fying, and labeling the collections has been actively continued, and
preparations were made for an exhibit at the World’s Columbian Ex-
position. The most valuable and interesting collection of reptiles
received by the Museum since 1890 was the material sent by Dr. C.
Hart Merriam, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These
specimens, over 900 in number, were collected by the Death Valley
Expedition in 1891 from the desert regions of California, Nevada and
Utah. Inaddition to the collections mentioned in the last report, there
has been received a number of specimens from Mr. P. L. Jouy, obtained
by him in southern Arizona. Facilities for studying the collections
were afforded to Dr. O. P. Hay, of Irvington. Ind., and Dr. G. Baur,
of Worcester, Mass. In addition to his other duties the curator has
continued his work on the supplementary volume of the ‘‘ Nomenelator
Zoovlogicus.” There were 1,055 entries in the catalogue of the depart-
ment during the year, embracing 1,004 specimens.

FISHES.

The work accomplished has, in general, been similar to that of the
preceding year. The honorary curator, Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, has been
occupied with his duties in connection with the U.S. Fish Commission,
and the routine work has chiefly devolved upon Mr. Barton A. Bean,
assistant curator. Fifty-five sets of duplicate fishes were prepared for
distribution to educational establishments. Each set contained about
125 species, including both fresh and salt water forms. Valuable
collections were received from the U.S. Fish Commission, Prof. B. W.
fvermann, Mr. P. L. Jouy, and Mr. Charles W. Richmond. The
estimated number of specimens added to the collection was 1,906, the
catalogue entries being 5538.

VERTEBRATE FOSSILS.

A large collection of vertebrate fossils, secured by the honorary eura-
tor, Prof. O. C. Marsh, during his official work for the U. S. Geological
REPORT OF ASSISTAN' SECRETARY. 19

Survey, was received at the National Museum in July, 1891, and was
immediately placed upon exhibition. This is the first installment in
the Museum of the official collections of Professor Marsh. The speci-
mens have been well catalogued and arranged by the assistant curator,
Mr. F. A. Lucas. Another valuable collection, sent from New Haven
by the honorary curator in 1886, is still im storage, on account of lack
of room in the exhibition hall. Professor Marsh is now preparing two
memoirs, containing a full description of the more important specimens
lately deposited in the Museum. During the year, 1,124 catalogue en-
tries were made, and about 1,061 specimens were added to the collee-
tion.

MOLLUSKS (INCLUDING TERTIARY INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS).

Mr. William H. Dall, honorary curator, reports that a large amount
of time has been devoted to sorting, naming, cataloguing, and storing
the duplicate shells. The greater portion of them is now packed in
small boxes in the storage room, each specimen bearing its catalogue-
number. <A card-catalogue makes it possible to refer at a moment’s
notice to any duplicates in the collection. It has also been found nee-
essary to arrange and catalogue the drawings of shells. The report
on the ‘Later Tertiary of the United States,” though in type, will be
issued a few days too late to appear in the Bibliography of this year.
Considerable labor has been bestowed on the continuation of the report
on the “Florida Tertiary Mollusks,” for the Wagner Institute of Phila-
delphia. The most valuable contribution during the year was a collee-
tion of shells frem St. Helena, donated by Capt. W. H. Turton, of the
Royal Engineers, Chatham, England. Mr. Rounsevelle Wildman,
United States consul at Singapore, sent a collection of shells repre-
senting the principal marine forms of that vicinity. The number of
specimens added during the year was 6,225, the catalogue entries being
2,046,

INSECTS.

Prof. C. V. Riley, honorary curator, reports that a large amount
of time has been devoted to the study collections in the laboratory,
although important additions have been made to the systematic exhibi-
tion series. Among the more important accessions are: 400 specimens
of Heteroptera, received from Prot. A. L. Montandon, Bucharest, Rouma-
nia; a collection of Californian insects, from Mr. D. W. Coquillet, of
Los Angeles; material collected by Mr. A. Koebele during the Death
Valley expedition, in 1891, from the Department of Agriculture; 1,900
specimens of Lepidoptera (native and exotic) from Mr. G. Beyer, of New
York; and 57 specimens, embracing 27 species, mostly Coleoptera, from
Mr. Charles Dury, of Cincinnati, Ohio. Mr. Dury has also expressed
his willingness to contribute more material, and to aid in every way pos-
sible in increasing the value of the collection. In September, 1891, Prof.
20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

John B. Smith, entomologist of the New Jersey Agricultural Experi-
ment Station, was requested by the National Museum to compare the
North American Noctuids in several of the museums of Europe, while
visiting that country for purposes of study. In London he studied the
British Museum collections, and succeeded in identifying most of the
Walker types and the species described by Guenee. He also made
critical comparisons between the collections of Grote, Zeller and
Walker. At the museum in the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, he succeeded
in finding many of the insects studied by Guenee and Boisduval, which
form, atleast in part, the basis of their work ou the North American
Lepidoptera. At Berlin he examined the collections of the Royal Mu-
seum, including material which has been used as the basis of papers on
North American species. At Dresden he examined the Standinger
collections, and compared long series from the Siberian, Alaskan, Ice-
landie, and other Arctic faunal districts. In the course of these studies
Professor Smith collected considerable information for publication in the
Proceedings of the National Museum, and he also sueceeded in obtain-
ing from Mr. W. Schaus, jr., who has collected extensively in Mexico
and South America, a promise to present to the Museum his coliection,
which is very large and contains many of the types described in the
Biologia Centrali Americana, About 16,500 specimens were added to
the collection during the year, the catalogue entries numbering 295,

MARINE INVERTEBRATES.

Mr. Richard Rathbun, honorary curator, states that considerable
progress has been made during the year in the study of the collections
of this department. ‘The accessions of the year show a marked increase
both in number and in extent and value. The U.S. Fish Commission
has transferred the collections of the Albatross in the North Pacific
Ocean, and important collections made by the Lish Hawkand the Gram-
pus have also been received. Some additions have been made to the
exhibition series; but little can be dene in this direction until more
space can be provided... Mr, J. E. Benedict, assistant curator, has con-
ducted experimental work witha view to the manufacture of some plas-
tic substance suitable for reproductions of soft substanees. The prepa-
ration of an exhibit representing the families of Ameriean marine in-
vertebrates for the World’s Columbian Exposition has progressed.
Mr. Benedict and Miss Rathbun have completed a monograph of the
genus Panopeus, and the latter has prepared catalogues of the Peri-
ceride and Matide. These will be published in the Proceedings of the
U.S. National Museum. The department has received the assistance of
several specialists in the determination of recently acquired material.
The number of catalogue entries during the year is 1,318. The number
of specimens received is 7,120.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 21
COMPARATIVE ANATOMY.

The work of the year has consisted largely in the preparation and
arrangement of osteological material by the assistant curator, Mr. F. A.
Lucas. The most important accession of the year was the skeleton of
a young sperm whale, obtained through the courtesy of the Life-Saving
Service from the station at Green Run Inlet. The U.S. Fish Commis-
sion contributed valuable material. The increasing care of the collec-
tions has prevented any special researches. The exhibition series is in
good condition. During the year 574 specimens were added to the eol-
lection, and a large number were transferred to the department of
vertebrate fossils.

INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS (PALEOZOIC).

Mr.C. D.Waleott, honorary curator, has necessarily devoted the greater
portion of his time to work connected with the U.S. Geological Survey,
with which he is associated. The principal accessions during the year
were received from the Geological Survey. The collection of Cambrian
and Ordovician fossils was placed upon exhibition.

In the latter part of 1891 the attention of the curator was called to
an unworked collection of Lower Carboniferous crinoids and associated
invertebrates from Crawfordsville, Ind., comprising specimens brought
together by Prof. Frank Bradley, and presented by Prof. O. C. Marsh
to the Yale University Museum, and others gathered by the Rey.
D. ‘A. Bassett upon his farm at Crawfordsville, and alse the property of
the Yale Museum. The National Museum possessed at that time but
one or two small specimens from this formation, and plaster casts of
several others. The curator urged the extreme desirability of securing
a full representation from this classic locality of North American Lower
Carboniferous fossils. After some correspondence with Prof. Marsh,
with this end in view, Mr. Charles E. Beecher, of the Yale Museum,
submitted a proposition, offering to give to the National Museum a
large number of the Bassett and Bradley fossils, provided the Museum
would be willing to work up the collection and supply the necessary
tools. This proposition Was accepted, and the task of working up the
collection was begun at New Haven, the university kindly furnishing
abundant laboratory room and every facility for properly carrying on
the work. The material, as it was received at New Haven, weighed
two tons, and contained between 3,000 and 4,000 specimens, many of
them, however, being duplicates. In addition to the single erinoids
and groups of crinoids upon slabs, the coilection meludes fossil brachio-
pods, corals, and other invertebrates. It is estimated that the value of
the share which will come to the National Museum will exeeed double
the amount of money expended in working up the collection. The
material is very showy and attractive, and will form a valuable addi-
tion to the exhibition series.
22 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

The number of specimens received during the year was about 569,
involving 95 catalogue entries.

INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS (MESOZOIC).

Dr. C. A. White, honorary curator, reports gratifying progress dur-
ing the year. The most important accession was received from the
U.S. Geological Survey. This embraced a large number of specimens,
including some of the most important paleontological material studied
by members of the Survey. There were 419 catalogue entries during
the year, representing about 3,099 specimens.

DIVISION OF BOTANY.
FOSSIL PLANTS.

Prof. Lester F. Ward, honorary curator, states that the work has
been chiefly confined to the installation and care of specimens. There
were added to the collection more extensive and valuable accessions
than in any previous year. The most important was the collection of
fossil plants, presented by Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa. This
collection munbers 100,000 specimens and is of world-wide reputa-
tion. Prof. F. H. Knowlton continued during the year his study of
the Laramie flora, and identified a large collection of plants from the
Bozeman (Montana) coal fields. The “ Flora of the Dakota Group,” by
the late Prof. Leo Lesquereux, was printed during the year.

RECENT PLANTS.

Dr. George Vasey, botanist of the Department of Agriculture, and
honorary curator of the department of botany in the National Museum,
reports that the growth of the National Herbarium has been steady,
although the percentage of increase has not been as great as in the
preceding year. The collections have been practically rearranged and
new labels provided. The duplicate specimens were threatened with
destruction by insects, and it became necessary to poison them to pre-
vent further damage. New specimens are now treated in this inanner
when they first arrive. Considerable time has been spent in the prep-
aration of a card-catalogue of all the botanical works in the libraries
to which this department has access. Among the more important ac-
cessions were the collections made by Mr, F. V. Coville, assistant bot-
anist of the Department of Agriculture (2,150 specimens); Mr. G. C.
Nealley (1,709 specimens from Texas and Arizona); Edward Palmer
(3,521 specimens from Mexico and Arizona); Mr, J. N. Sandberg (15,191
specimens from Minnesota and idaho), and Mr. J. M. Holzinger (2,530
specimens froin the United States and Europe). There were 512 cata-
logue entries made during the year, embracing about 53,384 specimens.
Of the total number of accessions, 41 were transmitted directly to the
National Museum, the remainder being received by the Department of
Agriculture.

DIVISION OF GEOLOGY.
MiNERALS.

Prof. F. W. Clarke, of the U. S. Geological Survey, continues to act
as honorary curator of this department, with Mr. W. 8. Yeates as as-
sistant curator. The preparation of an exhibit of minerals and gems
for the World’s Columbian Exposition has occupied considerable time.
A large part of the systematic exhibition series has been remounted on
ebonized blocks, and the specimens in the reserve series have been
transferred to the exhibition hall. It is intended to provide species
labels for the systematic exhibition series, indicating the chemical com-
position of each species, its crystallographic form, hardness, specific
gravity, and different varieties with their characteristics. The sys-
tematic duplicate series was thoroughly overhauled and reclassified.
Among the more important accessions were twenty-five boxes of min-
erals, presented by Mr. Joseph Willcox, of Philadelphia; several speci-
mens of minerals from Connecticut, and a crystal of spangolite from
Tombstone, Ariz., presented by Prof. 8. L. Penfield, of Yale College;
four specimens of ornamental stones and one specimen of churehite,
from Mr. Clarence S. Bement, of Philadelphia; two cut specimens of
transparent spessartite, from Mr. Ira R. Allen, of Fair Haven, Vt.;
three specimens of native gold from the Potomac mine, Montgomery
county, Md., presented by Mr. A. B. Russ, of Washington, D.C. Sev-
eral lots of minerals were also received from the U.S. Geological Sur-
vey. There have been 4,121 specimens added to the collection during
the year, the catalogue entries numbering 1,404.

GEOLOGY.

Mr. G. P. Merrill, curator, reports that the work in this department
has been largely confined to the arrangement and classification of mate-
rial, and the preparation of about 200 sets of Specimens for distribu-
tion to educational establishments. Several expeditions for collecting
specimens were made during the summer and autumn by the curator,
and by Mr. W. H. Newhall, his assistant. The work of preparing an
exhibit for the World’s Columbian Exposition was entered upon, and
the curator visited Arizona, New Mexico, Virginia, Tennessee, Ken-
tucky, Indiana, aud Missouri, collecting a large amount of volcanic and
cave material. The contributions made by Mr. G. F. Becker, of the
U.S. Geological Survey, Mr. W. B. Robertson, of Saltville, Va., Mr. EF.
W. Crosby, and Mr. Henry G. Bryant were among the most important
received during the year. The catalogue entries numbered 1,045,
embracing more than of 4,000 specimens.

F.—REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK.
REGISTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION.

In the report of Mr. S. C. Brown, registrar, it is stated that the total
number of packages of all kinds received during the year is 36,702—an
ae: REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

a

increase of 3,016 over the previous year. The entries covering these
receipts number 2,970, of which 980 consisted of specimens and 918 of
supplies intended for the National Musewn. The record of outgoing
packages for the year embraces 1,408 entries, covering 2,342 packages
of various kinds. The storage register shows that during the year 57
packages have been withdrawn from storage by officers of the Museum,
and that 290 packages have been temporarily placed in storage. Dur-
ing the year 98 transportation bills have been subdivided and copied,
and 184 letters written relating to the transmission of packages through
custom-houses and to railroad and express companies. In addition,
546 notices of transmission have been sent out. The total number of
accessions, 7. é., lots of specimens received for the National Museum,
during the year was 1,557. In addition, there were received 527 pack-
ages of specimels sent for examination and report. - The disposition of
the accessions among the departinents in the Museum is shown in one
of the appendices to the accession list, which constitutes Section v of
this report.

The distribution records show that during the year 172 packages, con-
taining 16,616 specimens.were sent out. These sendings included speci-
mens given, lent, sent in exchange, and returned to the owners.

LIBRARY.

Mr. N. P. Scudder, assistant librarian, has furnished the following
statement in regard to the operations of the Museum library during
the year:

The number of publications added to the library is 11,892 (693. vol-
umes of more than 100 pages, 1,642 pamphiets, and 8,486 parts of
regular serials). Of these, 297 volumes, 774 pamphlets, and 6,363 parts
of serials have been retained for the use of the Museum from the
accessions of the Smithsonian Institution, the remainder being obtained,
as usual, by gift. exchange, and purchase.

During the year, 6,094 books were borrowed from the library, of
which 1,832 had been returned at the close of the year. The books
assigned to the sectional libraries are counted with those borrowed,
hence the great excess of these over those returned. During the year,
243 orders for books were sent to the Library of Congress. There have
been added 2,235 titles to the card-catalogue by authors, and 1,989
cards were added to the subject-catalogue, making a total of 3,827
cards in this catalogue.

- SECTIONAL LIBRARIES.

The designations of the sectional libraries now organized, and the
number of books assigned to each, are as follows:

Administration.—141 volumes, 74 parts, and 81 pamphlets.

Aéronautics.—s volumes and 29 parts.

Astronomy.—b63 volumes, 522 parts, and 19 pamphlets.

Birds.—589 volunies, 155 parts, and 56 pamphlets.

Editor.—656 voluines, 229 parts, and 46 pamphlets.

Ethnology.—379 volumes, 99 parts, and 29 pamphlets.

Fishes.—52 volumes, 19 parts, and 10 pamphlets.

Geology.—T17 volumes, 169 parts, and 455 pamphlets.
32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Insects. —492 volumes, 310 parts, and 210 pamphlets.

Mammats.—210 volumes and 295 pamphlets.

Marine invertebrates. —89 volumes and 46 pamphlets.

Materia medica.—251 volumes, 97 parts, and 23 pamphlets.

Mesozoic fossils.—30 volumes and 2 pamphlets.

Mineralogy.—(A) 242 volumes, 63 parts, and 19 pamphlets; (B) 89 volumes, 24
parts, and 78 pamphlets.

Mollusks and cenozoic fossils.—110 volumes, 275 parts, and 89 pamphlets.

Oriental archwology.—311 volumes, 157 parts, and 157 pamphlets.

Plants. —396 volumes, 302 parts, and 335 pamphlets.

Prehistoric anthropology.—79 volumes, 40 parts, and 42 pamphlets, in addition to
the Rau Memorial Library of 1,609 titles.

Reptiles.—16 volumes, 7 parts, and 4 pamphlets.

Transportation.—121 volumes, 189 parts, and 2 pamphlets.

Owing to the failure of Congress to appropriate any money for bind-
ing, it has been impracticable to bind any of the books belonging to the
Musewn library. There are at least 1,500 volumes which need binding,
some being of great value.

In several instances it has been found necessary, in order to preserve
the books, to withdraw them from circulation, while in other instances
where the work of curators would not permit this, the books are being
worn out by constant though careful use.

Of the Smithsonian deposit 500 volames were bound upon application
to the Librarian of Congress.

PUBLICATIONS.

The public demand for the publications of the Museum is constantly in-
creasing, but comparatively few applications can be favorably considered
on account of the very limited appropriation for printing. Some years
ago both the Proceedings and Builetins of the Museum were reprinted
by the Smithsonian Institution in its Miscellaneous Collections. By this
means it was possible to supply a large number of libraries with these
publications. The Institution has, however, for several years ceased to
do this. The entire distribution of these publications now falls upon
the Museum, and with an edition of only 3,000 copies of the Proceed-
ings and of the Bulletins, it is evident that a large number of deserving
libraries must be excluded from the mailing-list, as well as many stu-
dents to whom these volumes would be of great assistance.

BULLETIN OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Of the Bulletin, Parts A to E of No. 39 have been issued. This Bulle-
tin is published in separate pamphlets, each one containing instrue-
tions to collectors in some special department of natural history. The
manuscripts of Parts IF (Directions for Collecting and Preserving In-
sects) and G@ (Instructions for Collecting Mollusks, and other Useful
Hints for the Conchologist) have been transmitted to the Public Printer.
It is hoped that this series of instructions to collectors will prove of
service to naturalists and others engaged in making natural history
collections. It is probable that before very long additional contribu-
tions to this series will be made, containing suggestions to collectors in
other branches of natural history.

In addition, No. 41, Bibliography of Dr. Charles Girard, and No. 42,
A Preliminary Descriptive Catalogue of the Systematic Collections in
Eeonomic Geology and Metallurgy in the National Museum, by Mr. F. P.
Dewey, have been published. The manuscript of Bulletin No. 40, Bib-
liography of George N. Lawrence, by Dr. G. Brown Goode, has been
temporarily withdrawn.

In order to meet special requirements in connection with the deserip-
tion of certain valuable collections in the National Museum, it has been
decided to issue, from time to time, monographsof collections in quarto
form. This series of publications will be known as the ‘“ Special Bulle-
tin.” During the year, No. 1 of this series, entitled ‘+ Life Histories of
North American Birds,” has been issued. This book has been prepared
by Charles E. Bendire, U. S. Army, honorary curator of the department
of birds’ eggs in the U.S. National Museum. Itis based largely upon
the collections in the Museum. The preparation of this book was com-
menced in aecordance with the wishes of Professor Baird. The present
volume relates only to land birds. Itis hoped that before long Capt.
Bendire will be enabled to prepare for publication subsequent vol-
umes relating to the same general subject.

A large number of papers upon scientific subjects has been published
by officers of the Museum and other specialists. These are, for the
most part, based on collections in the museum, and are referred to by
title in the Bibliography, constituting Section rv of this report. The
authors of these papers are seventy-five in number, thirty-two of whom
are connected with the Smithsonian Institution or the National Museum.
The papers referred to in the Bibliography number 238, and relate to
the following subjects:

HEATING AND LIGHTING.

The unexpended balance of the appropriation for heating and light-
ing and electric and telephonic service for 1891, held to meet unpaid
liabilities for that year, was $842.34. Bills have been youchered and
paid from this balance as follows: $46.20 for coaland wood; $74.75 for
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 59

gas; $200.25 for telephones; $384.95 for electric supplies; $52.75 for
electric work; $20 tor rental of call boxes; $81.79 for heating supplies,
making a total of $840.69, and leaving an unexpended balance July 1,
1892, of $1.65.

From the appropriation of 812,000 for heating and lighting for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, the disbursements are as follows:

For salaries or compensation, $5,218.93; for special or contract serv-
ices, $20; for coal and wood, $3,365.85; gas, $1,360.51; telephones,
$622.65; electric work and supplies, $124.53; rental of call boxes, $100;
heating repairs, $329; heating supplies, $455.62; making a total of
$11,575.09, and leaving an unexpended balance July 1, 1892, of $424.91,
to meet outstanding liabilities.

From the appropriation of 85,000 for removing decayed wooden floors
in the Museum building, and replacing them with artificial stene pave-
ment, and for the purchase of slate for covering trenches containing
heating and electrical apparatus, the expenditures for materials and
services to July 1, 1892, are $4,474.64, leaving on that date an unex-
pended balance of $525.36 on hand to meet outstanding liabilities.

With a view to securing the best pavement possible, as well as for
the purpose of obtaining for future guidance a practical knowledge of
the merits of the artificial stone flooring made by different bidders, three
proposals, which did not vary materially in amount, were accepted. It
will require a greater length of time than has yet elapsed to pronounce
upon the relative merits of these pavements, but they have already
proved themselves far more satisfactory than the wooden floors for
which they were substituted, and it is hoped that it will soon be possi-
ble to put down the same or some equally durable form of pavement in
other parts of the Museum.

From the appropriation of $5,000 for removing the old boilers under
the Museum hall in the Smithsonian building, and replacing them with
new ones, making necessary alterations and connections of steam-heat-
ing apparatus, and covering pipes with fire-proof material, the expen-
ditures are as follows: Alteration of pipes, etc., $121; purchase of two
new boilers, $2,769; black pipe, ete., $48.47; making a total expendi-
ture of $2,958.47, and leaving on hand July 1, 1892, an unexpended
balance of $61.55 to meet liabilities still outstanding.

The Museum is under obligation to Commodore Melville, U. S. Navy,
Chief of the Bureau of Steam Engineering, Navy Department, who, in
July, 1891, at the request of the Acting Secretary, appointed a board
of engineer officers to prepare specifications and examine bids for the
new steam-heating apparatus. The Museum was thus enabled to profit
by the skill and experience of Passed Assistant Engineer Baird and
Assistant Engineer Leopold, the officers designated to serve on this
board. The practical working of the steam-heating apparatus has
since demonstrated the wisdom of the board in the preparation of the
test questions and specifications submitted to the bidders, and of the
60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Museum in its final approval of the proposal of the firm to which the
work of putting in the new heating apparatus was intrusted.

In addition to the work mentioned in the detailed list, much has been
accomplished in the way of general repairs. The carpenter’s shop has
been extended to make room for two lathes; the storage shed south of
the Smithsonian building has been enlarged and the roof tinned; the
old paint shop has been reconstructed for use by the special employés
detailed for service in connection with the World’s Columbian Expo-
sition; steam pipes have been furnished with casing; the old and worn-
out fixtures connected with the plumbing of the Smithsonian building
have been removed and replaced with new; much necessary repairing
has been done to the roofs of both buildings; skylights have been re-
paired, painted, and glazed; windows have been glazed, painted, and
furnished with weather strips; the walls in both buildings have been,
to a considerable extent, painted and calcimined, and necessary repairs
in general have been made within the means available for this purpose.

By the laying of the asphalt walk on the west side of the Museum,
and the consequent raising of the grade in that locality, it was found
that the surface water, being turned toward the wall of the building
and having no way of escape, frequently collected there to the depth
of severalinches. Permission was accordingly asked of Col. Ernst, U.S.
Army, the Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds, to pro.
vide for the drainage of this area by the laying of a small sewer to be
connected with the large one from the Smithsonian building. ‘The re-
quired permit having been issued, the work was done by the Museum
force, With materials already available for this purpose.

The buffaloes were removed from the shed south of the Smithsonian
building to their new quarters in the Zodlogical Park on the 20th of
July, 1891. The building thus vacated was immediately renovated
and remodeled for the use of the painters.

The number of requests for the use of the lecture hall by the scien-
tific societies of Washington and the country has not varied materi-
ally, the average being about twoa month. In some parts of the year,
however, the hall is required in this way much more frequently, so
that its proper preparation as aroom of public assembly becomes an
item of considerable importance in connection with the work of the
Museum force. The Geographic Society used the room for lectures on
five different dates in April, 1892, and in this month, as usual, the
annual session of the National Academy was held here for four days,
April 19 to 22. At the time of the annual sessions of the various
scientific associations of the country, which are often held in the hall
of the Museum, it generally becomes necessary, as in the case of the
Academy, to prepare and set apart some of the smaller rooms of the
building also for the meetings of the committees, a courtesy which is
always cheerfully accorded. In addition to these meetings, held in
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY, 61

the lecture hall of the Museum. the National Art Association was
given permission to use the room in the Smithsonian building, known
as the chapel, for an art exhibition during the two weeks beginning
May 16, 1892.

It should also be mentioned that various scientific and educational
associations avail themselves more and more frequently of the privilege
of using the oxyhydrogen lantern belonging to the Museum, for the
purpose of illustrating their lectures, which, if not given in the lecture
hall, are, as a rule, held at the Columbian University or the Cosmos
Club. The lantern is always used under the direction of a skilled oper-
‘ator connected with the Museum, and, except on oecasions for which
the use of the lecture hall has been granted by the Regents of the Insti-
tution for the Washington meetings of national scientific and edu-
vational societies, the expenses incurred for gas, etc., are paid by the
society under the direction of which the lecture is given. Among the
bodies which have availed themselves of the use of the lantern during
this year are the Association of Agricultural Colleges, the Association
of Agricultural Chemists, the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, the Geological Society of America, the International
Geological Congress, the Philosophical Society, the Biological Society,
the American Folk-Lore Society, the Cosmos Club, and the Corcoran
School of Art.

In compliance with the request of the Department of State, and in
accordance with the act of Congress making an appropriation for the
purpose, preperations were begun in June, 1892, for an exhibit by the
National Museum at the Columbian Historical Exposition, to be held
in Madrid, in commemoration of the four hundredth anniversary of the
discovery of America.

Preparations for the exhibit of the Museum at the World’s Columbian
Exposition, commenced last year, have been prosecuted vigorously.
As the act of Congress making the appropriation for this exhibit pro-
vides for no clerical service, the work of this nature required for the
Exposition has been performed by the Museum force, often, of course, at
the expense of service beyond the regular departmental hours. While
the necessity for extra work is always cheerfully complied with, it is
but proper to put on record the fact that there exists a gradually in-
creasing need for a permanent addition to the clerical force.

CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORTS.

The work of this office continnes under the direction of Mr. R. I.
Geare. The force of assistants in July, 1891, consisted of 2 stenograph-
ers, 2 typewriters, 2 indexers, 1 accession clerk, 1 copyist, and 1 mes-
senger. During the year the work increased considerably, and before
the close of the year it had been found necessary to obtain the services
62 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

of an additional clerk. In May, 1892, the distribution of Museum pub-
lications was added to the work of the office, and in the months of May
and June there were partially distributed Dr. W. L. Abbott’s Catalogue
of Ethnological Collections in the U.S. National Museum from Kili-
ina-njaro, East Africa (published in the Report of the National Museum
for 1891), and a paper by Dr. G. Brown Goode, entitled Museums of the
Future (published in the Report of the National Museum for 1890).
During the year the routine work connected with the distribution of
specimens has also been attended to in this office. The correspondence
of the Museum (including the acknowledgment of gifts, loans, and ex-
changes, the preparation of reports upon material sent for examination,
and replies to requests for technical information of all kinds), and the
preparation, editing, and proof-reading of the Annual Report of the
Museum, constitute the principal work of the office.

The routine work performed in the case of each letter received is as
follows: The date of its receipt at the Museum is stamped upon it, after
which the proper reference is indorsed upon it.* It is then charged to
the person to whom it is referred, and inclosed in a wrapper, on which
is written the name and address of the writer, the subject of the inquiry;
and the name of the person to whom it is referred. On its return from
the referee a reply is prepared, which, with the original letter, is trans-
mitted to the Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or Curator-in-charge, for
signature. It is then detached, marked for filing, and a labelis attached
giving the name and address of the writer, the subject, and date of
letter. The letters written are copied in the current number of the
appropriate series of letter-books. All letters written are indexed in
the letter-books, and also on cards prepared for the purpose. These
cards are filed alphabetically, and thus, at a glance, the amount of cor-
respondence with any person, including the date of each letter, can be
ascertained. A cross-reference is also prepared under every name
mentioned in each letter written, and filed alphabetically. By this
means a clew is often furnished to correspondence which it would other-
wise be difficult to find.

A record is kept, in card-catalogue form, of all offers of specimens
which are not at the time accepted, whether offered as gifts, loans, in
exchange, or for sale. The possibility of bringing together in a mo-
ment all offers relating to material ina given department of the Museum,
has frequently proved very useful, and has saved many hours’ work in
examining’ the letter-files.

“A large proportion of the letters does not require reference, in which case the
intermediate steps of the routine are omitted,

BUILDINGS AND LABOR—POLICE AND PUBLIC COMFORT.

The report submitted by Mr. Henry Horan, superintendent of build-
ings, shows that the force of laborers and mechanies has been busily
employed under his supervision, assisted by Mr. Charles A. Steuart.
The following abstracts from his report indicate some of the principal
items of work the force has accomplished:

1891.

July.—The buffaloes were removed from their quarters south of the Smithsonian
Institution to the Zodlogical Park, and the shed thus vacated was remodeled for use
asa paint shop. The Jackson sarcophagus was removed from the west hall of the
Museum, and placed on the parking north of the building.

August.—The animal pens south of the Smithsonian building were removed. The
Museum was opened to visitors on the evening of the Zist, and also of the 28th, on
which occasions it was lighted by electricity.

September.—The American Pomological Association held a fruit exhibition in the
northeast court from the 18th to the 25th, inclusive. The Japanese house, which
has been in storage for some months, was set up in the west hall.

October.—The work of reconstructing the wall-cases on the west side of the north
hall was completed. The remainder of the living animals were removed to the
Zoological Park on the 24th.

November.—The laborers were employed in removing the exhibition cases prepara-
tory to the work of tearing up the floors in the west-south and north-west ranges,
for the purpose of laying granolithic pavements. Two heavy slabs of granite and
sandstone were fastened to the wall in the west-southrange. The work of putting
in place the new boilers for the Smithsonian building was commenced on the 234d.

December.—The west end of the Smithsonian building was kalsomined and painted.
The cases were removed from the lecture hall, and the room was prepared for the
meetings of the American Forestry Association, the American Historical Association,
and the American Geographic Association. Granolitbic pavements were laid in the
tank room, the photographic laboratory, and the north-east court, involving a large
amount of work by the laborers in removing cases and cleaning.

1892.

January.—Both buildings were suitably draped in respect to the memory of Gen.
M. C, Meigs, a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution, who died January 2. The
64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

work of preparation of floors, preliminary to the laying of new pavements by the con-
tractors, was continued during January and February.

February.—Shelves were placed at the west entrance, in order to provide storage
room for the property clerk. The wall-case on the south side of the north hall was
altered.

March.—A large number of exhibition cases were cleaned, the locks overhauled,
and the doors eased. The preparation of the lecture-hall for meetings and lectures
required the attention of the laborers several times during the month. It was found
that the weight of the exhibition cases rendered the bird gallery in the Smithsonian
building unsafe, and some of the cases were accordingly removed.

April.—An electric light was hung at the east entrance of the Museum. Skilled
laborers were engaged in repairing the tiling around the building. Repairs were
made in the chapel of the Smithsonian building.

May.—The boiler room in the Smithsonian building was thoroughly cleaned and
whitewashed, and new window frames were placed in the coral hall. The chapel
was prepared for an exhibit by the National Art Association. An electric alarm was
placed in the Joseph Francis case, for the purpose of protecting the collection.
Sewer traps were placed at the foot of the steps at the northwest entrance of the
Museum and in front of the door to the World’s Fair carpenter-shop, the work being
done by Museum laborers. An addition was made to the south end of the Museum
carpenter-shop, to provide room for two lathes.

June.—A number of exhibition cases were brought from storage in the Armory
building and prepared for shipment to the Madrid Exposition. The large lathe
was removed from the engine room to the carpenter shop. The shed at the west
end of the Smithsonian building was extended to provide room for the storage of
cases, etc. The work on the new return pipes of the Smithsonian building was com-
pleted on the 17th instant, so far as it was possible to carry them this fiscal year. A
concrete walk was laid in the area at the south door of the Smithsonian, the work
being done by laborers from the Museum force. Extensive repairs were made in the
public-comfort rooms.

THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS,.
TAXIDERMISTS.

The force of taxidermists, under the charge of Mr, William Palmer,
has been engaged, the greater part of the time, in the preparation of an
exhibit for the World’s Columbian Exposition. The entire exhibition
series of mamials has been examined and cleaned, and a number of
mounted specimens have been repaired and placed upon new stands.
The skins in pickle have been overhauled. The total number of skins
received from all sources during the year is 492. Of this number 368
have been worked up. The total number of skins on hand at the end of
the year is 452. For the World’s Fair exhibit, 181 mammals have been
mounted and finished, including 6 Rocky Mountain sheep, 5 Newfound-
land caribou, 3 Alaskan caribou, 3 Arizona deer, 4 armadillos, 5 badg-
ers, 8 Californian sea lions, a male walrus, from Walrus Island, Bering
Sea, and an African crocedile. A series of experiments have been suc-
cessfully made with a view to preparing a composition for making casts
of reptiles. Experiments, with good results, have also been made in
preserving leaves and plants for use as accessories in groups of ani-
mals.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. — 6D
OSTEOLOGICAL PREPARATOR,

The greater part of the time of Mr. F. A. Lucas, the osteological
preparator, has been devoted to matters other than those pertaining
directly to his department. Important work has, however, been ac-
complished in the preparation of skulls and skeletons for the study
series. Several weeks were spent in the preparation of the skeleton
of a young sperm whale. A summary of the work accomplished is
given in the following table :

Mr. A. Zeno Shindler has been engaged in painting life-size casts for
the Department of Ethnology, including among others the figure of an
Una Indian, a group of five Kiowa children at play,an Eskimo woman
at play, an Eskimo woman and child, Sitting Bull, and a Labrador
woman and child. Mr. Shindler has also continued the work of paint-
ing in oil representations of the various races of man, and has made a
copy from a photograph of a painting of Pocahontas, dated 1616,

G.—ACCESSIONS.

The number of accessions received during the year is 1,557* (acces-
sions Nos. 24528 to 25884, inclusive). These accessions embraced
228,249} specimens, giving an average of about 168 specimens to each
accession. This increase over the number of accessions received last
year, as Shown in the foot-note, is the more conspicuous, as no effort
has been made to invite contributions on account of lack of space for
exhibition or storage. A large proportion of the specimens received
will, for this reason, have to remain in the boxes in which they were
shipped to the Museum.

A tabulated statement, showing the number of accessions to the
Museum annually since 1881 (the first year of occupancy of the Museum
building) is here presented :

IL—EXPLORATIONS.

The collections of the Museum have been very materially increased
during the year through the codperation of various collectors, com-
missioned by the Smithsonian Institution or the Museum, as well as
through the interest and courtesy of friends of the Museum who have
voluntarily offered their services in procuring material for the Museum.
The collections which have resulted from the assistance of these per-
sons are here referred to.

Dr. W. L. Abbott, whose contributions to the Museum have for many
years been so generous and acceptable, has added a very interesting
and valuable collection chiefly from Kashmir and Baltistan, comprising
ethnological objects, birds’ skins, mammal skins and skulls, and inelud-
ing specimens of the Himalayan ibex and Vigne’s sheep.

From the Department of Agriculture, through Prof. C. V. Riley,
entomologist, were received 3,473 specimens, representing 636 species
of insects, collected by Mr. A. Koebele, during his connection with the
Death Valley expedition in March and April of 1889. These specimens
were transferred from the Department of Agriculture to the National
Museum.

The Museum has also been the recipient of land and fresh-water
shells from the same locality, obtained during the same expedition.

Mr. James KH. Benedict, of the National Museum, was engaged in
an exploring trip in the vicinity of Point Lookout for the purpose of
obtaining marine invertebrates for the Museum. He was successful
in his undertaking and added several very interesting specimens to
the collection.

Mr. R. M. Bartleman, of the United States legation, Caracas, Vene-
zuela,expressed his willingness to obtain views for the National Museum,
and he was accordingly furnished with a photographie outfit for that
purpose, An interesting series of photographs, representing native
94 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

scenery and other objects connected with Venezuelan life and the sur-
rounding country, has been received from him.

In the chapter on explorations, contained in the Report of the National
Museum for 1890, mention was made of an exploring expedition which
had been sent into the unexplored lands of Africa by the British South
African Exploring Society. This expedition was joined by Mr. William
Harvey Brown, who was sent out under the auspices of the Smith-
sonian Institution in connection with the Naval Eclipse Expedition,
and who had made during the previous year large and valuable addi-
tions to the collections of the National Musewn. In a letter recently
received from him he states that he has secured for the Museum natural
history specimens, including several head of large game from the Um-
swezi River. These specimens have not yet been received. The only
material received from him during the present year are six birds’ skins,
representing four species from Angola.

Mr. J. H. Camp, Leopoldville, Congo district, Africa, in a letter dated
December 29, 1891, offered to collect natural history specimens for the
National Museum. A collection of African butterflies, photographs
of natives, and botanical specimens has been received from him.

Mr. William Astor Chanler, of New York City, visited the Smithson-
ian Institution in September, 1891, and kindly offered during his pro-
posed travels in Africa to make collections for the Smithsonian Insti-
tution. His offer was gladly accepted, and the result of his exploration
in connection with the Institution will be given in a later report.

The U.S. Fish Commission has transferred several large and inter-
esting collections to the National Museum during the year. Among
them are valuable collections of plants from the Galapagos Islands and
Alaska, collected by the Albatross, under the direction ef Prof. Alex-
ander Agassiz; a collection of birds, rocks, insects, batrachians, birds’
skeletons and nests, also collected by the steamer Albatross; specimens
of crustaceans collected by the Albatross in the North Pacific Ocean,
and birds from the Galapagos Islands obtained by the same steamer,
under the direction of Mr. Charles H. Townsend.

The U. S. Geological Survey, has, through its director, Maj. J. W.
Powell, added largely to the mineral collections of the National Museum,
as well as by the contributions made by individuals connected with the
Survey while engaged in field-work in different parts of the country.

On September 15, 1891, letters of introduction to James P. Turnbull,
United States consular agent, San Luis Potosi; Hon. Thomas Ryan,
Minister to Mexico; Rev. George B. Winton, and Dr. Pagenstecher
were given to Mr. P. L. Jouy, of the National Museum, who visited
Mexico for the purpose of making collections of natural history speci-
mens for the National Museum. The results of his expedition will be
recorded in the next Report.

Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U. 8. Army, while engaged in his work with
the International Boundary Commission, kindly offered to collect natural

history specimens for the National Musewn. There have already
been received from him several very interesting collections, and a full
report of those not mentioned in the accession list accompanying the
present Report, will be given in the Report for 1895.

» Mr. George P. Merrill, of the National Museun, engaged in an explor-
ing expedition through Arizona and New Mexico, and secured for the
Museum some beautiful specimens of onyx marble and other acceptable
geological material. In Virginia and adjoining States he also obtained
interesting ores and marbles.

Mr. Newhall, of the National Museum, while engaged in field-work
for the Museum, obtained rocks, ores, and conglomerates from Virginia
and New Jersey.

Mr. Charles W. Richmond, Department of Agriculture, in a recent
trip through Guatemala and Nicaragua, by an agreement made with the
National Museum, secured several large collections of natural history
specimens. A detailed report of these collections will be found by ref-
erence to the accession list (Section Vv), and the material received after
the close of the present fiscal year will be recorded in the next Report.

In addition to the collections which have heretofore been received
from Mr. I. C. Russell, of the U. S. Geological Survey, in connection
with his explorations in Alaska, he has generously contributed a num-
ber of ethnological objects, consisting of Eskimo ivory carvings, dishes,
spoons, pipes, daggers, dolls, trinkets, ete., from the Upper Yukon
River.

Dr. Timothy E. Wilcox, U.S. Army, Fort: Huachuea, Ariz., has con-
tinued to transmit specimens for the National Museum from the vicinity
of Fort Huachuca. Some very rare specimens of reptiles have been
received from hiin.

Mr. Thomas Wilson, curator of Prehistoric Anthropology in the
National Museum, was present at the opening of the Hopewell mine in
Chillicothe, Ohio. The objects exhumed consisted of copper spools,
copper pieces, bones, mica cut into stencils, a broken effigy, boat-shaped
objects of stone, beads made of bone, and a large number of pearls
bored or drilled, ete.

Mr. William 8S. Yeates, assistant curator of minerals in the National
Museum, collected specimens in North Carolina, and secured some very
acceptable minerals and Miocene fossils.

REPORTS OF THE CURATORS OF THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM
UPON THE PROGRESS OF THEIR WORK DURING THE
FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1892.

99
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By OTs T. Mason, Curator.

During the fiseal year the entire staff of this department has been
engaged in making preparation for the World’s Columbian Exposition. ©
The subject of ethnology at Chicago having been placed under the
charge of Prof. Putnam, of Cambridge, it was necessary to devise some
scheme by which his operations in the general exhibit should be kept
separate from that of the Smithsonian Institution in the Government
building.

After consideration it was thought best to have the work of the
Bureau of Ethnology (which is under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution) and that of the Department of Ethnology united. For the
double purpose of this cooperation and of avoiding conflict with the gen-
eral exhibit, it was very opportune that the work of Maj. Powell, entitled
Indian Linguistic Families of America North of Mexico, was completed,
so that it could be utilized for our purpose. The result of this investi-
gation is that the tribes of North America have been divided into the
following linguistic families: Algonquian, Athapascan, Attacapan, Beo-
thukan, Caddoan, Chimakuan, Chimarikan, Chimmesyan, Chinookan,
Chitimachan, Chumashan, Coahuiltecan, Copehan, Costanoan, Eski-
mauan, Esselenian, Lroquoian, Kalapooian, Karankawan, Keresan, Kio-
wan, Kitunahan, Koluschan, Kulanapan, Kusan, Lutuamian, Mariposan,
Moquelumnan, Muskhogean, Natchesan, Palaihnihan, Piman, Pujunan,
Quoratean, Salinan, Salishan, Sastean, Shahaptian, Shoshonean,
Siouan, Skittagetan, Takilman, Tanoan, Timuquanan, Tonikan, Ton-
kawan, Uchean, Waiilatpuan, Wakashan, Washoan, Weitspekan,
Wishoskan, Yakonan, Yanan, Yukian, Yuman, Zunian.

Many of these stocks, whatever may have been their previous his-
tory, at present include only a few individuals. Indeed a few of them
have become extinet, and are known only in the literature of the early
explorers and missionaries.

The Chicago Exposition furnishes an excellent opportunity of testing
the questions—how far language codrdinates itself with industries and
activities as a mark of kinship and race, and how far climate and the
resources of the earth control the arts and industries of mankind in the

101
102 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

sphere of language and race. For the purpose of testing these questions
thoroughly, the following stocks have been selected: Algonquian,
Athapascan, Eskimauan, Iroquoian, Kiowan, Koluschan, Muskhogean,
Piman, Shoshonean, Siouan, and Yuman, in order to emphasize ori-
ginal influences as affecting activities regardless of stock.

~ Southeastern Alaska and British Columbia were chosen as one region,
northern Colorado, Oregon, and Washington as another, southern Cal-
ifornia and parts adjacent as a third region, and the Pueblo country as
a fourth.

The Algonquian family formerly inhabited the southern and eastern
drainage of Hudson Bay, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, the Atlantie
slope of the United States as far south as the thirty-fifth parallel, the
regions around lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior, and almost the
entire drainage of the Ohio River. This would give an excellent op-
portunity of studying the effect of twenty-five degrees of latitude and
every variety of elevation, access to inland and salt waters, abundance
or scarcity of various animal and vegetable productions. The question
then in this case would be to find out how far uniformity of activities
had been secured over this wide and varied area by the possession of
a common language.

The Iroquoian stock occupied the region around lakes Erie and On-
tario, and the upper St. Lawrence River. They were also in possession
of the Susquehanna drainage, the mountainous region of Tennessee,
Kentucky, Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Alabama, with two
small grants on the Atlantic coast, one in southern Virginia, the other
in eastern North Carolina.

The territory of the Muskhogean stock was bounded on the west by
the Mississippi River, north by the Tennessee River and Cherokee
Country, south by the Gulf of Mexico, east by the Atlantic Ocean.
This stock was early visited by Spanish, French, and English explorers,
and, on account of the advanced civilization of its tribes, has been
looked upon as furnishing the best explanation of the mode of life among
the Mound Builders.

The Siouan stock may be studied with advantage, on account of its
restriction to the country of the buffalo, extending along the Missis-
sippi (and particularly the Missouri), on the plains of the great West,
reaching as far north as Saskatchewan River and as far south as the
city of Natchez. A narrow strait across the State of Wisconsin, extend-
ing to Lake Michigan, was occupied by this stock, and some of the
tribes are known to have lived in the mountains of Virginia and North
Carolina, above the falls of the rivers running into the Atlantic Ocean.
The Biloxis of Louisiana belong also to this stock.

Perhaps the most interesting of all the stocks, as regards geographic
distribution and the relationship between tribal organization, language,
and activities, is the Athapascan, occupying the drainage of the Yukon
River, in Alaska, and the Mackenzie River, in Canada, and extending
DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY. 103

southward and inland to the upper waters of the Frazer River, in British
Columbia. They touch the waters of the Pacific at Cook’s Inlet, in Alaska,
and on the coast of northern California and southern. Oregon. They
are also spread out over Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Mexico.
The distance between the most northern and most southern members
of this stock is over 40 degrees of latitude.

The Eskimauan stock affords an excellent example of a homogeneous
people, spread out over many thousands of miles in an eastern and west-
ern direction, but always in an arctic or subaretic environment. In
this area, however, there is great variety of materials, so that the
same apparatus appears in one place, made of walrus ivory, in another
of antlers, in another of driftwood, in another of bone. At the lowest
points reached by these people may be found implements fashioned from
the standing trees. Another source of variety in the production of
this stock is the accessibility of the various regions to the whaling indus-
try and other forms of trade. In those places from which the trading
vessel has been excluded, the people are living in unchanged simplicity.
In other parts where the natives have been in close contact with the
whites, as in the Russian domain, the acquisition of better tools has
enabled them to improve remarkably upon their own arts, and this may
fairly raise the question whether in other parts of North America the
arts of the aborigines were not bettered by the coming of the superior
race.

The Kiowan stock, so far as we can gain any knowledge of its
spread historically, was confined to a very narrow area in Wyoming
and Nebraska. The Kiowas are surrounded by Siouan, Shoshonean,
and western Algonquian tribes; furthermore, since their home is on the
plains of the great West, the buffalo country, their arts may be expected
to resemble those of the surrounding peoples.

The Shoshonean stock, joined by Brinton and others with the Piman
stock and the Aztecan, is confined chiefly to the Great Interior Basin,
with outlying tribes in and across the mountain east and west. In one
place, at the Moki villages, we have an example of Shoshoneans living
in pueblos; all of the other tribes are dwellers in tents.

The Pueblo country furnishes an excellent example of the mode
of architecture and life controlled by the region, and dominating
over both language and tribal organization. In the open country
among these Pueblos dwell the Apache and Navajo, of Athapascan
stock, and late intruders from the north. These two peoples of the
same family differ very much in ail the arts of life, because the former,
refusing to receive flocks from the Spaniards, have continued their
course as bloodthirsty savages down to the present moment. On the
other hand, the Navajo, accepting flocks of sheep from the Spanish
explorers, have learned the value of personal and tribal property, and
have changed their mode of life and their industries altogether in ae-
cordance with the new state of affairs,
104 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Around the Gulf of California are the Piman and Yuman stocks,
and these, owing to their homogeneous environment, furnish better
material for the student of comparative ethnology. ;

In exhibiting material from the Pacific slope, owing to the great
variety of stocks crowded in circumscribed areas, the study was made
of special regions offering natural conditions. Between Vancouver
Island aud Mount St. Elias is a vast forest region, the waters abound-
ing in fish. Here are the Koluschan, Chimmessyan, Skittagetan, and
Wakashan stocks, and their homogeneous environment enables the
ethnologist to study the diversities of tribes and stock, so far as they
are expressed in natural things.

The Salishan and Shahaptian stocks together occupy the drainage of
the Lower Frazer and Columbia rivers and could easily be considered
apart. But from the mouth of Columbia River to the Santa Barbara
Islands there is such a confusion of languages that we should hardly
expect to find a new set of activities corresponding to each one of
them.

The effort was made during the year to set up in proper costume
groups of men, women, and children belonging to the largest of these
stocks, engaged in some characteristic operation, so as to give to the
visitors to the exhibition some idea of how the people would look in
their homes. In addition to this, an arrangement was made for a series
ot alcoves, each one devoted to a separate stock. The objects were to be
arranged in these aleoves to show the habitation, industries, and activ-
ities of the tribes belonging to the several stocks. Supplementary to
this, a series of alcoves was devoted to characteristic arts, and in these
the materials, apparatus, and products of each art were arranged upon
an ethnographic basis, enabling the beholder to compare tribe with
tribe upon the basis of a single industry.

Inasmuch as a large amount of American aboriginal handiwork is
made by women, it has been thought advisable to devote one alcove
exclusively to woman’s work. The object of this is especially to show
that the seeds of our modern industrial life were sown by women in
savagery. Whether we regard the exploitation of the earth for min-
erals in the shape of clay for pottery or materials for cooking vessels
and cutlery, the gleaning of the fields and forests for plants to be
worked up into food and textile, or the manipulation of animal sub-
stances of food, shelter, clothing or useful apparatus, the result is the
same. It has been decided to exhibit these results in an alcove espe-
cially set apart for women’s work.

ACCESSIONS.
The following accessions, made during the year, deserve special men-
tion:

As a result of the patent congress, Miss Nellie Long Maynard loaned to the Na-
tional Museum, through Mr. George W. Maynard, the collection of models and fire-
DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY. 105

arms illustrative of the invention of the Maynard rifle. This deposit. in connection
with that of Col. Dodge, secures to the Museum a most creditable series of breech-
loading firearms.

From the Cocopa, Yaki, Yuma, Papago, and other tribes of Sonora, Mexico, and
Lower €alifornia, Mr. Edward Palmer collected for the Museum objects illustrating
the industries of these tribes. The specimens in this collection are of the greatest
value because they were selected in order to illustrate the humble industries of
these tribes.

The Icelandic Natural History Society made a contribution of clothing and honse-
hold utensils from that island.

The musical instruments of the Samoan islands were contributed by Hon. Howard
M. Sewall. :

From Torres Straits Mr. A. C. Haddon sent a collection of eighty-three pieces il-
lustrating the arts and life of the natives of that region. They are especially in-
teresting on account of the contact at this point between the Papuan and Austra-
lians.

Capt. J. O. Spicer, of Groton, Conn., has added one more to the many obligations
under which the Museum has been brought by his generosity in giving specimens of
Eskimo clothing from Hudson Bay.

Hon. Alex. R. Webb, consul to the Phillippine Islands, collected apparatus for
games and gambling.

The collection of 372 pieces of Mr. James Mooney from Kiowa, Cheyenne, and
Arapaho, Comanche, Sioux, and Wichita Indians was made with a view to illustrat-
ing the life of these tribes at the Chicago Exposition. Therefore they are of special
value for ethnographic study.

Capt. John G. Bourke continued to manifest his interest in the Museum and sent
trom Mexico objects of very great value.

Dr. W. J. Hottman, for the Bureau of Ethnology, made a collection among the
Ojibwa and Menomonee Indians.

Mr. R. W. Bartleman, United States legation, Caréeas, Venezuela, has taken a
special interest in the National Museum, and sent valuable material from that coun-
try.

Mr. Emile Granier contributed costumes and industrial implements from the Arap-
ahos and Shoshones.

The Museum was very fortunate to secure from the Royal Zoélogical Museum,
Florence, through Mr. H. H. Gigloli, ethnological specimens from New Guinea,
Andaman Islands, and from several groups in the Molgave and Melanesian area.

Miss Anna Picher, of Pasadena, Cal., contributed specimens of Mexican handiwork.

Dr. Z. T. Danie!, U.S. Army, continued to favor the Museum with specimens from
Dakota.

Mr. 8. G. Worth, U. 8. Fish Commission, contributed apparatus to illustrate the
turpentine industry of North Carolina.

Mr. Fred. A. Ober sent from various islands of the West Indies rude appliances in
vogue among the more ignorant peoples.

Lieut. George Emmons, U. 8. Navy, sent to the Museum a number of bracelets of
great value from Sitka.

Through Hon. Rounseyelle Wildman, United States consul at Singapore, the Mu-
seum received a sinall number of weapons and apparatus for gaming.

Dr. Washington Matthews made a collection of Navajo wools and the material
used in dyeing them.

Dr. W. H. Dall gave to the Museum collections made in India by his father, Rev.
€. H. Dall.

The Museum is greatly indebted to Mr. I. C. Russell for 171 specimens collected
during his exploration of interior Alaska.

Dr. C. E. Woodruff, U. S. Army, contributed 37 photos of Hupa Indians in Cali-
fornia,
106 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

From Mr. H. R. Thornton the Museum secured a complete suit of armor made in
imitation of that of Japan from plate of walrus ivory.

A collection of ethnological objects from the Montagnais Indians of Labrador was
presented by Mr. Henry G. Grant.

Lieut. G. B. Harber, U.S. Navy, presented a costly and beautiful series of fing cloth-
ing from the Yokut of North Siberia. Additional value is given this collection by
the fact that these costumes were worn by Lieut. Harber and members of his party
during the Jeannette relief expedition.

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes presented to the Museum illustrations of Moki dances and
rendered good service in labeling many of the specimens collected already in the
Museum from ancient Tusayan.

Dr. Franz Boas brought from the Chinuk tribes of Washington Territory a small
collection.

From Capt. R. H. Pratt, U.S. Army, the Museum has received a large collection from
various Indian tribes represented by the children at Carlisle school.

From Mr, Charles de Struve the Museum received 39 portraits of the people of
Russia.

Mr. John Murdoch gave a small collection of Eskimo clothing personally made by
him at Point Barrow, Alaska.

The Museum received a great many favors from Mr. Stuart Culin, of Philadelphia,
who has familiarized himself with the games of the Chinese.

Mr. J. H. Turner, of the U.S. Coast Survey, gave the Museum 277 specimens col-
lected on the boundary line between Alaska and Canada.

Dr. R. H. Lamborn, of Philadelphia, has loaned to the Museum a collection of
Galton’s anthropometric apparatus.

Mr. Edward Lovett, of Croydon, England, has continued to enrich the Museum
with specimens from the East.

ROUTINE WORK.

The routine work of the department of ethnology during the fiscal
year was greatly aided by the construction of a large cabinet for the
study series of objects and the setting apart of a special room for
specimens too large for the ordinary cabinet. Owing to the lack of
space it will be impossible in the future to increase the number of ob-
jects on exhibition at any one time. To meet the difficulty, and also to
prepare for any additional space which may be granted in the future to
this department, the curator has continued to mount and label new
specimens in standard unit boxes. The boxes compare in size to the
standard Museum drawers, viz: 30 inches in length by 24 inches in
width, and of any depth to suit specimens from 2 to 12 inches. When
once the specimens are mounted andlabeled and sealed up in these ex-
hibition boxes, these may be filed away on shelves or racks like books
in a library.

The curator has had a large number of drawings made and has pre-
pared the library material for a monograph on the arts of war among
the North American aborigines. Mr. Walter Hough has bestowed a
great deal of care on the preparation of a catalogue of the Korean col-
lection,* which has been brought together through the codperation of

*See Report of U.S. National Museum, 1891, pp. 429-488.
DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY. 107

Dr. Allen, Ensign Bernadou, U. S. N., Mr. P. L. Jouy, and others in-
terested in the work of the National Museum.

In conclusion the curator most earnestly hopes that in future more
ample accommodations may be furnished for the exhibition of the
ethnological collections. The object of all such exhibits should be the
education of the people in the history of culture, but a comprehensive
and correct idea of human progress can be given only where there is
sufficient room to tell the whole story without crowding.

The first catalogue entry in July, 1891, was 152651, and the last
entry in June, 1892, was 153894, giving a total of 1,243 entries.

The number of specimens received during the year is 2,241.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF AMERICAN ABORIGINAL POTTERY
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By WiLitiAM H. Houtmus, Honorary Curator.

The operations in this department have been chiefly confined to the
instalment of a large number of collections, none of which are of espe-
cial importance. These collections consisted for the most part of frag-
mentary wares collected for the Bureau of Ethnology by the curator
and his assistants in the tide-water districts of Maryland and Virginia,
and in the Gila valley, Arizona.

During the year the curator completed an elaborate paper upon the
pottery of the mound-builders, to be published by the Bureau of Eth-
nology. Two papers upon aboriginal decorative art, derived from
ceramic sources, were published in the “ American Anthropologist,”
one in the January and the other in the April number.

The last catalogue number for June, 1891, is 136183; and for June,
1892, 155306.

Donations of earthenware were made by the following persons: Mr.
Samuel A. L. Queredo presented fragments of painted pottery from the
Argentine Republic, South America. Mr. W. Hallet Phillips trans-
mitted fragments of vases from Ossabaw Island, Georgia. Mr. William
Harden contributed a large earthen vessel from Ossabaw_ Island,
Georgia. Prof. G. K. Gilbert, of the U.S. Geological Survey, presented
fragments of ancient pueblo ware from Arizona. Mr. Henry Adams
sent fragments of pottery from St. Helena Island, Georgia. Capt. John
G. Bourke, U.S. Army, transmitted earthen vessels from Guadalajara,
Mexico. Mr. Arthur H. Weston gave fragments of pottery from Florida.
Thomas Dowling, jr., contributed fragments of pottery from Montgom-
ery County, Md. From Mr. EK. 8. Golson were received fragments of
pottery from Saginaw River, Michigan.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES
IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892,

3y CYRUS ADLER, Assistant Curator,

In the absence in Europe of Prof. Paul Haupt, honorary curator of
the section, I beg to subinit the following report for the past year:

The scope of an oriental department fully organized may be seen
from the division into sections which was adopted by a committee of
the American Oriental Society, organized for the purpose of drawing
up a programme to be submitted in the event of the assembling of an
International Congress of Orientalists in America. The sections were
as follows:

I. Aryan section. II. Semitic section (Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac,
ete.). ILI. Cuneiform section, including all languages using cuneiform
characters. IV. Egyptian section, comprising the other African lan-
guages with the exception of Ethiopic and Arabic. V. Section of the
extreme Orient (China and Japan) and of Central Asia.

The Section of Oriental Antiquities, in view of the limitations upon
its scope and resources, is practically devoted to Biblical archeology,
to the archeology, history, languages, arts, and religions of the peo-
ples of western Asia and Egypt. Material is chosen which especially
illustrates Biblical history, and labels are prepared from this point of
view. |

The fact must be emphasized that before the organization of this sec-
tion was contemplated, much of the material which would find place in
a department of oriental antiquities had been collected for the Museum
and installed in other departments, where it still remains.

In the report for 1889 the hope was expressed that from the policy
inaugurated by the Museum of preparing copies of Assyro-Babylonian
objects for a study collection, there would grow a catalogue of all the
Assyro-Babylonian objects in this country. This plan, it is expected,
may shortly be realized. At the meeting of the American Oriental

11h
112 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Society held in Washington in April, 1892, the following resolution was
adopted :

In view of the introduction into this country of numerous collections of oriental
antiquities, especially from Egypt, Assyria, and Babylonia,

Resolved I, That the Oriental Society recommends that records be obtained of such
objects, in both public and private collections ;

Resolved IT. That a committee of three be appointed by the president to aid in
securing such material.

The assistant curator was appointed a member of this committee.

The American Oriental Society held its annual meeting in the chapel
of the Smithsonian Institution, April 21-25. A portion of the Hodg-
son collection of oriental MSS., and of photographs of Assyrian ob-
jects and of paper impressions of Kgyptian sculpture, was tempo-
rarily placed on exhibition in the chapel during the meeting.

Mr. Frederick Stearns has offered to place his collection of Babylo-
nian cylinders and other oriental objects of glyptic art at the disposal
of the Museum for copy.

The honorary curator, Prof. Paul Haupt, left for Kurope in the month
of May. He will attend the Ninth International Congress of Oriental-
ists at London as the delegate of the Smithsonian Institution.

The assistant curator returned from his absence in the Orient in the
interest of the World’s Columbian Exposition in the month of January,
and resumed his connection with the Museum on March 1. Much of
his time has been given to the formation of a collection of religious cer-
emonials for the exhibit of the National Museum at the Columbian
Exposition.

Two very carefully made and well-preserved paper molds of a piece
of sculpture and a cuneiform inscription from Persepolis have been
received, through the Department of State, from the Honorable Truxton
Beale, United States minister at Teheran. Casts have been made from
these molds and their contents will be described in a special paper.

Mr. Beale had secured permission from the Persian Government to
remove some objects from Persepolis. On arriving at the spot he con-
cluded that nothing characteristic could be removed without grossly
disfiguring the ruins. He found also that Mr. Herbert Weld Blun-
dell had already commenced to make copies for the British Museum,
but was quite willing that the National Museum should coéperate in
the work. These two moldings, the first made, were presented by
Mr. Blundell to Mr. Beale. It appears that the mold of the cuneiform
inscription is the first ever taken from Persepolis. It is to be hoped
that means will be found to prosecute this important archeological
undertaking.

The Museum has received on deposit from the Telfair Academy of
Arts and Sciences, of Savannah, Ga., a portion of the collection of
oriental books and manuscripts of the late William B. Hodgson. Mr.
Carl L, Brandt, director of the Telfair Academy, is entitled to hearty
SECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES. 1t3

recognition for his assistance in securing the deposit of this interest.
ing collection.

The crowded state of the Museum has rendered it impossible to place
any more objects in the exhibition series,

Two papers, relating to the Hodgson collection, were read by Dr.
Adler before the American Oriental Society at the meeting held in
Washington: ‘“ Notes on William B. Hodgson” and ‘ Christopher
Columbus in oriental literature with special reference to a Turkish
MS.”

The catalogue of the section is kept by the department of ethnology.

REPORT ON THE HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

A. Howarp CLark, Curator.

The curator of historical collections, being also editor of the Pro-
ceedings and Bulletin, and in charge of the printing of iabels and
blanks for all departments of the Museum, has been unable to give as
much attention as desired to the general work on the very valuable
collection of objects classified as ‘ historical relics,” and which are of
very great interest to the numerous visitors to the National Museum.

An effort has been made to place on exhibition relics or memorials
that may teach biography or American history in an intelligent man-
ner, rather than to exhibit objects that are simply “curios,” bearing 10
special relation to eminent men or important events.

Being without the aid of an experienced assistant, the curator is
unable to report much technical work accomplished in the study and
arrangement of the hundreds of medals and coins that have accumu-
lated. In fact, the incomplete condition of several classes of objects on
exhibition, as regards proper labeling and installation, has necessitated
the temporary withdrawal of some of the most interesting collections.

For exhibition at the Columbian Historical Exposition at Madrid in
the summer and fall of 1892, the curator brought together quite a full
series of American colonial coins; medals illustrating the colonial
period, the Revolutionary War, and medals commemorative of political *
and civic events, besides a large series of paper money, extending from
the early days of the American colonies down to the present national
currency; also postage stamps of each issue since 1847, when they
were introduced in this country; maps of early explorers, engravings
of important national events, ete.

The character of the historical colleetions in the National Museum
was outlined in the curator’s report for the last fiscal year, and an effort
has been made to carry out the plan therein set forth. Some valuable
additions have been made to the collections. The number of accessions
has been thirty-three, aggregating several hundreds of individual

115

116 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM 1892,

objects. Among the important accessions were the cabinet of ancient
and modern gold, silver, and copper coins, antique seals, ete., bequeathed
by Gen. Meigs; the Cox memorial vase from Mrs. 8. 8. Cox; the Sevres
vase presented to Prof. Hilgard, some autograph papers by President
Adams and William Henry Harrison, the original roll and muster of
Gen. Washington’s body-guard in 1782, a dish and ewer of precious
metals presented to Admiral Jouett, and a complete collection of photo-
graphic and engraved portraits and autograph letters of members of
the National Academy of Sciences.

The curator has been called upon to examine and report on ten col-
lections of coins, medals, and historic objects, which have been returned
to the owners.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF GRAPHIC ARTS
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By 8. R. KOEHLER, Curator.

Repeating the words of my report for last year, it may be said that
the work done in the section of graphic arts during the fiscal year just
ended, does not show perceptibly in the appearance of the collections
exhibited. The aim has again been to make the several divisions more
complete by filling gaps here and there, and these additions are, as a
matter of course, lost in the mass to the general observer. From the
following details it will appear that the endeavor to complete the illus-
tration of the modern photo-mechanical processes has been continued,
while at.the same time due attention has been given to the other
departments, so far as the means at command would allow. :

The most important additions of the year are the illustrations of the
half-tone relief screen process and of a variety of the photo-aquatint
intaglio process (Photogravure Gilbo), prepared for the Museum at
reduced prices by Mr. M. Wolfe, of Dayton, Ohio, and Messrs. A. W.
Elson & Co., of Boston, Mass., respectively. Some interesting speci-
mens, illustrating the advances made in chromocollographic process ©
work, have been given by Mr. KE. Bierstadt, of New York, and the J. B.
Lippincott Company, of Philadelphia. The collection of materials
used in the photo-mechanical processes has been increased by gifts
from Messrs, Jas. P. Smith & Co., of New York, and by purchase. A
beginning towards the illustration of the application of chromolitho-
graphy and of wood-cutting to the production of posters—a kind of
work which has reached a high order of merit in the United States—
has been made by the gift of a few specimens by the A. S. Seer Theat-
rical Printing Company, of New York; the Courier Lithographing
Sompany, of Buffalo, N. Y., and Messrs. W. J. Morgan & Co., of Cleve-
land, Ohio, and by the purchase of some of the tools used. The fol-
lowing additions to the illustrations of the history of the reproductive
arts have been made by purchase: Head of Christ, P. 192, woodcut
after Diirer; Portrait of Otto Heinrich von Schwarzenberg, woodeut,
dated 1607, by Chr. van Sichem, after Goltzius; Christ before Annas, B
12, engraving on copper by Israel van Meckenem; Portrait of Philip
II, engraving on copper, dated 1586, by Hieronymus Wierix; Portrait

121
122 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

of Jan Lutma, the younger, by himself, dated 1681, executed on copper
with punches (opus mallet), the first specimen of this kind of work ac-
quired by the Museum, and a fine proof of J. G. Miller’s portrait of
Anton Graff, after Graff, engraved on copper.

The specimens received during the year have mostly been placed on
exhibition. To accomplish this, part of the division of photo-mechani-
cal process work had to be rearranged, and a number of table-cases
had to be placed in the aleoves. These cases interfere somewhat with
the appearance of, and the freedom of movement in, the alcoves, but they
are excellently well adapted for the display of technical specimens, and
it is to be hoped, therefore, that more of them will be provided as the
collections grow and are rearranged. Considerable progress has been
made in the labeling, by the substitution of written for printed labels.
It has been possible in this way to label nearly all the specimens on the
eastern, and a considerable number of those on the western side of the
hall of Graphic Arts. It is now proposed to complete the labeling in
this manner, leaving the collections for the present in essentially their
actual condition, with the exception of such additions as it may be pos-
sible to make meanwhile. The next step will be the systematic cata-
loguing of all the material on hand, and the endeavor to procure such
additional specimens as are needed to complete the various series.
This done, the whole collection can be rearranged according to the
catalogue, and a manual of it can be prepared for the use of students.
The exhibition of The Reproductive Arts, arranged by me at the Mu-
seum of Fine Arts, Boston, at the beginning of this year (1892), and
the catalogue prepared for the same exhibition, were preliminary stud-
ies on the basis of which the more extensive scheme planned for the
U.S. National Museum is to be carried out.

No further progress has been made in the arrangement of the collee-
tion of patents.

The last number entered on the catalogue of the section of Graphic
Arts for the year ending June 30, 1891, having been 4797, and the cor-
responding number for the year now under consideration being 4976,
it follows that the number of entries during the year has been 179. As -
some few of these entries represent more than one specimen, the num-
ber of accessions may be given in round numbers at about 200. Of
these specimens 42 were purchased. <A list of the donors is included
in Section v of the report. No statistics can be given, for the present,
of the reserve and duplicate series.

IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892,

By Dr. B. E. FERNOW, Honorary Curator.

The forestry collections have remained without many additions, owing
to the fact that lack of space limits their exhibition, and the bulkiness
of the material makes it undesirable to add to them in the storage-
rooms.

Since the Museum does not, like the Kew Gardens, command any
grounds of its own for the exhibition of living specimens, and the city
parks of Washington afford ample opportunity to serve as an arboretum,
the curator ot forestry collections has prepared during the year a full
list, with notes, of all the tree species found in these parks, and plotted
the same so that they may be readily found. This compilation, car-
ried on at the expense of the Museum, will be ready for publication next
year.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By J. ELFRETH WATKINS, Curator,

During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, the time of the curator
was largely taken up by assignment to other duties; hence little atten-
tion could be devoted to the section.

Unfortunately for the student of the history of the American steam-
boat and railway, little thought was given in the early days to the
preservation of objects which would now be considered invaluable
relics of the early stages of the development of these appliances of
transportation upon water and land.

So far as is known, the important relics now in existence, with very
few exceptions, have been deposited in the U. 8. National Museum
through the cooperation of the officials of railway and steamboat com-
panies. The future additions to the transportation collection must,
therefore, necessarily consist of models and drawings of historic objects.
Since the appropriations by Congress did not permit of their construe-
tion or purchase, extension of the collection during the year has been
made by the acquisition of such objects relating to the development of
the mechanic arts as illustrate the evolution of the epoch-making inven-
tiorts.

During the year the curator took part in the meetings* of the Ameri-
can Association for the Advancement of Science, at Washington; the
convention of the Old-Time Telegraphers’ Association, at Washington,
and the ceremonies at the completion of the monument erected by the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company at Bordentown, N. J.

The erection of this monument (Plate 1) by the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company, to mark the first piece of iron railway track laid between
New York and Philadelphia in 1831, attracted the attention of officials
and employés of the railway companies throughout this country, and
the general public as well, and a description thereof found place in the
principal railroad journals of Europe and America. <A description of

the monument from the memorial volume issued at the time is given
below: ;

The railroad monument at Bordentown, erected by the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company, was completed in 1891. It is composed of a cube of Baltimore granite, 5
feet square and 7 feet high, supported upon an octagonal foundation composed of the
stone blocks upon which the iron rails were originally laid in the tracks of the Cam-
den and Amboy Railroad. Around this cube is a circle composed of two of the
original rails with which the road was first laid. These rails are supported by stone
blocks according to the original practice, the spikes and joint fixtures also being
from the original tracks. This type of rails, which is now known throughout the
world as the ‘‘ American rail,” was designed by Robert L. Stevens in 1831. Sunk in
the south side of the granite block is a bronze tablet, which contains a representa-
tion (carefully drawn to seale), in relief, of the locomotive ‘‘ John Bull,” with
tender improvised from a freight truck, with tank consisting of a whisky hogshead,
and the two passenger cars that first did service in the State of New Jersey in 1831.

The tablet (Plate1r) contains the following inscription in raised letters:

“FIRST MOVEMENT BY STEAM ON A RAILROAD IN THE STATE OF NEW
JERSEY, NOVEMBER 12, 1831, BY THE ORIGINAL LOCOMOTIVE ‘JOHN
BULL,’ NOW DEPOSITED IN THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM
AT WASHINGTON. THE FIRST PIECE OF RAILROAD TRACK IN NEW JER-
SEY WAS LAID BY THE CAMDEN AND AMBOY RAILROAD COMPANY BE-
TWEEN THIS POINT AND THE STONE, THIRTY-FIVE HUNDRED FEET EAST-
WARD, IN 1831.”

Upon the east side of the block, cut into the granite are the words:
‘“CAMDEN AND AMBOY RAILROAD, 1831,”
and on the reverse side is inseribed:
“ERECTED BY THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY, 1891.”

The programme of the exercises at the celebration of the sixtieth
anniversary of the first movement by steam in the State of New Jersey,
which was held at Bordentown, November 12, 1891, was as follows:

The Pennsylvania Railroad Company has since published the
addresses delivered at the celebration in a memorial volume, hand-
somely illustrated.

Interest in the department of transportation at the World’s Colum-
bian Exposition has led to frequent examinations of the collection dur-
ing the year, the objects both in the exhibition and study series being
studied by officials of the Exposition and of several railroad compa-
nies who propose to take part therein. The chief of the department
of transportation-exhibits of the Columbian Exposition spent several

days in the Museum, in August, 1891, where he studied the collections
and had access to a provisional outline of a proposed exhibit, which
had been prepared by the curator at the request of the assistant see-
retary of the Smithsonian Institution, to be used if it were decided that
the section of transportation and enginecring should be represented in
the Governnent exhibit at Chicago.

With the return of this scheme of classification the following corm-
munication was received:

OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL,
WoORLD’s COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION,
Chicago, Ilt., U. S. 4., August 27, 1897.

DEAR Sir: I return herewith a scheme of a transportation exhibit, which you
kindly loaned to me, and which promises to be of much value. Iam greatly obliged
to you for the favor, as also for the other literature which you kindly gave me.  I6
will save a great deal of research which would otherwise have been necessary.

Yours truly,
WILLARD A. SMITH.

Prof. J. E. WATKINS,

National Museum, Washington, D.C.

Access to the study and exhibition series in the section was also
given to Maj. J.G. Pangborn, special agent in charge of the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad Company’s historical exhibit at the World’s Colum-
bian Exposition. Numerous photographs of models and drawings in
the collection were made by Maj. Pangborn’s representative for this
exhibit, which promises to be more elaborate than ever before made at
an exposition by a railroad company.

At the request of the chief clerk of the Post-Office Department a
number of models and drawings in the collection were photographed to
form the basis of illustrations for a publication which is designed to
show the growth of the United States Post-Office Department.

Among the important accessions during the year are the following:

Electrical locomotive, which made the most rapid recorded speed (115 to 120 miles
per hour) on land, by generated power, at Lanrel, Md., in the year 1889. Publicly
reported by O. T. Crosby in his paper entitled High Speed Electrical Works, and
by J. Dashiell, jr., in the Electrical Railway as Applied to Steam Roads. Both papers
are to be found in the proceedings of the American Association of Mechanical Engi-
neers.

The following letter accompanied this most interesting piece of machin-
ery:

New York, June 13, 1890.

My Drar Sir: According to your request I make the following statement: My
electric motor was originated and designed by me for rapid speed. I had in view
the enlargement of the same to supplant the steam engine on standard railroads for
long-distance service.

It was the first electric motor which was successfully run with the armatures
wound directly around the axles, thereby doing away with all wearing parts except
the journals, and admitting of any speed desirable.

H, Mis, 114, pt. 2 9

130 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

My motor was run near Lanrel, Md., on a circular track, 2 miles in cireumference,
constructed especially for making these experiments, which extended over a period
of nearly two years, during which time speeds were made from 100 to 120 miles per
hour. Twenty miles per hour was the fastest speed made by any other electrical
motor until mine had made 100 miles per hour,

Yours very truly,
Davip G. WEEMS.
Prof. J. E. WATKINS,
Washington, D.C,

The following certificate is attached to the locomotive:

On December 3, 1889, I witnessed Mr. Weems’ electric motor make a speed of from
115 to 120 miles per hour. I was employed by Mr. Weems as mechanical engineer
for about two years. and assisted in a number of test trials of speed made with the
motor, and also assisted at the time the above fast rate speed of 115 to 120 miles was
made.

B. J. DASHIELL, JR.

The collection has been greatly enriched by the addition of the series
of models, tem-plates, and drawings of the various sections of rails, which
were considered by ‘the committee on form, weight, manufacture, and
life of rails,” appointed by the American Society of Civil Engineers in
1873, and whose deliberations have had an important bearing upon the
American rail standards for the last twenty years. This series, which
is a most valuable one, was presented by Mr. Octave Chanute, past
president, American Society of Civil Engineers, who was an active
member of the committee during all its deliberations.

A series of models of steel railroad cross-ties used in Europe was
deposited by Dr. B. E. Fernow, of the Division of Forestry in the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, who, in his official capacity, is taking an active
interest in the introduction of metallic ties upon American railroads,
in order that the present demands shall not continue to be made upon
the forests of this country to supply the wants of railroad builders.

Mr. 8S. L. Roberts, of the Amboy Division of the Pennsylvania Rail-
road, has added to the collection previously deposited by him, a num-
ber of objects illustrating the development of the rail splice. These
objects were mainly collected from the old Camden and Amboy Rail-
road.

The value of the collection of telegraphic apparatus has been greatly
enhanced through the enthusiastic cobperation of Mr. George C. May-
nard, of Washington, secretary of the American Association of Invent-
ors and Manufacturers. .

During the annual convention of the Old Time Telegraphers’ Associ-
ation their loan collection of telegraph apparatus was, at his sugges-
tion, placed on exhibition in the section, and attracted much attention.

Among the important objects since deposited are to be found the
cross-arm and insulator laid on the line from Washington to Baltimore
in 1841; a register and relay used in the first office opened in Indiana
in 1848; twisted telegraph wire used in 1864; various forms of earthen-
ware and glass insulators, and a pair of English dial telegraph instru-
ments.
SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING. jSyk

The collection showing the development of the typewriting machine
has received several valuable additions, among them the typewriter in-
vented by John Pratt in 1864, which was obtained through his kindly
assistance.

Messrs. Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict have added a Danish writing-
ball and other old forms of typewriters to their collection, among them
a model of the Sholes & Glidden typewriter invented in 1867, together
with the original of one of the first machines made from this model.

The curator has received communications from the Caligraph Coim-
pany and Mr. W. H. Travis, of Philadelphia, both of whom promise
valuable additions to this collection.

The Singer Manufacturing Company has increased the collection of
sewing machines referred to in the last report.

The application of Jesse Ramsden for a patent for an equatorial
instrument, written and signed by himself, has been presented to the
Museum by Mr. Park Benjamin and placed in the case with the origi-
nal dividing engine, deposited a few years since by Dr. Morton, presi-
dent of Stevens Institute.

Among the relies, attention may be called to the plaster model from
which the bronze tablet for the monument erected at Bordentown by
the Pennsylvania Railroad Company was cast. This model was re-
ceived through Mr. J. T. Richards.

A sedan chair, decorated with gold and handsomely upholstered,
which was owned and used by the royal family of France during the
reign of Louis XIV, has been deposited in the collection by Miss Kathe-
rine Parsons, of Washington.

The recent increase of popular interest in matters relating to the his-
tory of transportation is most remarkable, while the recognition of the
importance of illustrating this phase of human effort by the managers
of American expositions is none the less gratifying.

At the Centennial Exposition of 1876 a single old steam locomotive
and ear were exhibited, together with a few implements of transporta-
tion, shown in the ethnological collection. At New Orleans, ten years
later, a single railway exhibited a series of models of ancient locomo-
tives and cars. At Cincinnati, in 1888, the first synoptical exhibit
showing the development of the art of transportation was made by the
U.S. National Museum in the Government building, where a very lim-
ited space could be devoted to the subject.

At the World’s Columbian Exposition, four years later, a handsome
exhibition building containing 250,000 square feet of floor space has
been erected, which, together with the annex, occupies an area of over
17 acres.

It is indeed a matter of the greatest satisfaction to know that the
importance of that place in history which is occupied by the record of
the development of the methods of intercommunication through which
132 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

our national growth has been so greatly accelerated during the century,
is thus to receive due recognition.

The extent of the collection of transportation exhibits, together with
the publications in relation thereto, can not fail to make a permanent
and world-wide impression, both upon the visitors who see, and those
absent who read of their maguitude.

Thus will the future generations be made to understand the influ-
ence Which the world’s great systems of transportation have had upon
the progress of civilization during the four centuries since Columbus
sailed away from Palos in a caravel,

IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By WiLiiaAM 8. Dixon, U.S. Navy, Honorary Curator.

During the year ending June 30, 1892, the labeling of specimens and
illustrations of plants, ete., in the exhibit was completed. Several
specimens that had deteriorated were replaced by good examples.
Kifforts were made to identiiy some of the vegetable specimens presented
to the Museum. Their accompanying history being meager, and essen-
tial characteristics absent, a satisfactory recognition was impossible.

The accessions during the year number 55, and were received princi-
pally from the Royal Kew Gardens, England. Several specimens were
received from W. H. Schieffelin & Co., in response to special request.
The arrangement of this section is, essentially, as left by Dr. Flint, the
first curator of this collection.

GENERAL REVIEW OF THE YEAR’S WORK.

The general character of the work of the past year is not greatly dif-
ferent from that of other years. There is the same reception of speci-
mens, their classification, entering, numbering, and cataloguing; they
then have to be marked and put in the display cases assigned to the
State to which they belong, or if not classified geographically, among
other specimens of the same kind.

The curator was engaged during the first part of the fiscal year upon
the preparation of a work which he considered was needed in the United
States—a gathering or collection of the evidences of high antiquity of
man in America, Later on, he took up a particular chapter of that
work, to wit, that on arrow- and spear-heads or knives. Before the lat-
ter was entirely completed, he was called upon to prepare an exhibit
for the Exposicion Historico-Americano, held at Madrid,* Spain, in
celebration of the fourth centenary of the discovery of America by
Christopher Columbus.

It was believed that the display made for Madrid could be utilized
for the Chicago Exposition, and the work thus done in the current year
would serve equally well for the display to be made in the subsequent
year, but that hope has not been realized.

The number of specimens received during the past year is about equal
to the average of former years, amounting to nearly ten thousand speci-
mens.

IMPORTANT ACCESSIONS RECEIVED DURING THE YEAR.

From Dr. Edward Palmer: A collection of objects from an ancient
Indian village site 34 miles NW. by N. from Manzanillo, Mexico. A large
obsidian implement, 3 polished hatchets, a hammer stone, a rubbing

Was to open in that city on the 13th of September, though it did not actually do so
until the 30th of October. It closed on the Ist of February, and the display has not
returned at the time of writing this report, although Mr. Wilson did not remain dur-
ing the entire period of the exposition.

stone, fragment of a metate, > clay-vessels, 90 fragments of pottery,
22 small grotesque clay figures (human form), 15 ornamental clay beads,
5 obsidian flakes, a shell ornament, an animal tooth, a fragment of
human jaw with teeth (child), a stone ax, and a quantity of broken
pottery (not counted); one hundred and forty-nine specimens. From
Mr. Palmer’s notes concerning this collection the following extracts are
taken: “In a secluded cove of the harbor of Manzanillo is an embank-
ment several feet above high tide, upon which is a thicket of bushes and
trees. Removing these and by digging, remains of an Indian village
site containing stone implements, pottery, etc., are discovered. Much
excavating has been done, and some of the embankment from time to -
time has crumbled down, tending to still more break the pottery. It
would seem that at the time of its abandonment (probably during the
Spanish conquest) much of the material was broken and destroyed, as
none of the stone mortars and metates are complete.” With this acces-
sion were also received 46 fragments of clay figures (mostly human
form), from ancient house sites near the village of Almeria, State of
Colima, Mexico, 30 miles east of Manzanillo. Mr. Palmer says: ‘+A
railroad cut revealed the house sites. The surface in places shows
rocks of different forms and sizes placed in rude cireles. The Indians
who once lived here were removed by force, and that would account
for the fragmentary condition of most of the objects found.”

In addition to the above-mentioned objects was sent a human skele-
ton* with painted bones, from a cave on the island of Espiritu Santo,
near the harbor of La Paz, Lower California.

From the Royal Zodlogical Museum, Florence, Italy, through Prof.
Henry H. Giglioli: Twenty-five worked flint flakes, a terra-cotta ball,
a terra-cotta fusaiole of unusual shape, 2 earthenware vases, a boar’s
tusk, and a point of roebuck’s horn, from the cave of Lazzaro, Rosilini,
near Modica, Sicily (see Bull. Paletnologia Ital. vu, 1892); bone
breccia with worked flints imbedded, from cavern of Les Eyzies, Dor-
dogne, France, Lartet & Christy; 6 fragments of subfossil bones and
2 teeth of equus and 10 worked flint knives and scrapers from a
cave on the island of Levanzo (Egades), W. Sicily—discovered by
Prof. H. H. Giglioli, August 29, 1890; 7 flint knives and scrapers
and two arrowheads, from Sartiano, Siena, Italy; 2 flint knives, a
scraper, and 13 arrowheads, collected in the vicinity of Florence,
Italy; portion of a flint borer, found at the Therm of Caracalla,
tome, Italy; 3 casts in wax of beautiful flint implements (knife, ar-
rowhead, and a dagger, or spearhead), from an Etruscan tomb at Sa-
turnia, Tuscan Maremina.+ The originals are in the Museum of Anthro-
~*'The skeleton was presented to me [Mr. Palmer] by Gaston Vevis, esq., of La Paz.
Nothing was reported to have been found with the bones. (Ace. 24600.)

iThe question ‘* Whence came the Etruseans” is probably the foundation of the

oldest dispute or discussion known to history. It beganin the fifth century B.C., be-
tween Herodotus and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and continued until the nineteenth

Italy; a stone fusaiole found near Arezzo, Tuscany; blade of a bronze
dagger, found near Cortona, Tuscany (rare); 2 primitive bronze fig-
ures (human), votive or sacred, from an Etruscan tomb near Chiusi,
Italy (rare); 2 bronze man heads, spikes, from Etruscan necro-
polis, near Chiusi (rare); a Roman sling-stone in lead, with inserip-
tion, found near Ascoli-Piceno, Italy (rare); an Etruscan sling-stone
in lead, with inscription, found near Cortona, Italy (rare) (this speci-
men is Similar in shape to the sling-stones of steatite used by the natives
of New Caledonia); a small silver fibula, Greco-Italic, from an ancient
tomb near Japua, southern Italy; plaster cast of a small stone chisel
from the Santa Cruz district, Jamaica, West Indies (the original is in
the archeological museum, at Cambridge, England); a worked flint
knife or scraper from the Babel-Maluk Valley, near Thebes, Egypt, and
5 flint flakes found with many similar ones near Baalbec, Syria; col-
lected by Dr. Verio in 1890; 5 fragments of rudely ornamented pot-
tery, 3 shells, 26 bones of a pig (Sus andamanensis), and 2 bones of a
fish from a Kitchen-midden, near Port Blair, Andaman Isiands, Bay
of Bengal (relics of the aborigines), collected by EK. H. Man, esq.;
7 fragments of coarse pottery from a mound on the Manatee River,
British Honduras, collected by J. Ballamy in 1890; 6 rude figures in
coarse terra cotta, excavated from ancient tombs on the bank of the
Rio Tajajos, Province of Para, Brazil; the figures represent an owl, a
tortoise, a sitting human figure, the legs of a bird, a human head, and
a cone-shaped object, collected by A. M. d’Almeida Leal in 1889. -En-
tire number of objects received, 146. (Acc. 24918.)

From the National Museum of Anthropology and Ethnology, Florence,
Italy, through Dr. Paolo Mantegazza, curator: A collection of archieologi-
cal specimens from Italy; a fragment of worked wood and a plaster cast
representing a somewhat similar piece, from the lacustrine habitation
at Mecurago, Province of Novara (bronze age): model in plaster of a
perforated stone disk, and a fragment of pottery from lacustrine habi-
tation at Isolino, Lake Varese; fragment of pottery (brilé), Terramare
de Noceto, Parma; tragment of pottery from the cave of Bergegei
(Savona); terra-cotta spindle whorl /usaiole from Mount Calamita, island
of Elbe; two polished hatchets from Casentino, and one from Mount
Cuccoli, Tuscany; polished stone hatchet (diorite) from the Province of

eentury. The discovery in this country of, prehistoric man with his ages of stone
and bronze has settled the question that the Etruscan country was occupied long
prior to the Etruscan civilization, and, there being nothing to the contrary, we may
suppose that the former occupants were the ancestors of the Etruscans. Some of
the monuments at Saturnia were dolmens and have been recognized as belonging to
the prehistoric ages of stone or bronze. It may, therefore, be doubted whether the
“)eautiful flint implements” mentioned really came from an ‘‘ Etruscan tomb”
at Saturnia. As they are similar in every particular to prehistoric flint implements,
it has been contended that they belonged to the ages of stone or bronze, and were
earlier than Etruscan.—Curator.

the valley of the Vibrata, Abruzzi (collection of Dr. Concerio Rosa); 2
flint flakes or knives from the valley of the Vibrata and 1 from the
Ambra; a bronze hatchet from Maremma, Tuscany.

The following objects (11 in number) are from different localities
on the island of Elbe, collected by Dr. Raffaello Foresti: Two flint

From the same source were also received 38 modern oak disks
from interior Italy, turned in a lathe and decorated with concentric
rings. The sizes of these disks are respectively 63 by 2, 43 by 14, 34
by 12 inches. The North American idians had a game called Chung-
kee, played with disks of stone by rolling them on the ground or court.
These wooden disks are used in Italy to play the similar modern game of
Ruzzole (called Ruzzoletta when played by children with the. small
disks). Itis sometimes played by peasants, when they use disks of
cheese in the form common to the country, betting one cheese against
the other, the winner taking both. It is then called ‘+ Giuocco del For-
mageio,” or play of the cheese. It is played by two persons, but may
be by four, arranged in opposing sides. The game is played similar to
quoits, except that the disks are rolled on the ground instead of being
pitched through the air. Goals or marks are established, and the player,
standing alternately at one, rolls toward the other, the disks nearest
the mark being the winners. This game is of great antiquity, and is
believed to be a survival of the classic game represented by the antique
statue of Discobolus. (Ace. 24919.)

from a gravel pit near New Carlisle, of bone perforators and chisels,
pieces of worked bone, animal teeth, broken flint spear heads and frag-
ments of ahuman skull. (Ace. 25633.) From letters received with the
specimens, the following extract is taken:

“The ridge in which the pit was dug is of a glacial formation, having a southeastern
anil northwestern direction. The gravel is in layers and reaches to the surface. On
the top of the ridge the gravel has been removed, making a boat-shaped hole, length
about 15 feet, width in center 6 feet, depth in center 4 feet. In this cavity, which
was filled with red clay mixed with gravel, the specimens were found.

Nos. 1 and 2 (fragments of a human skull) were found within 1 foot of the surface,
with no evidence of other bones. A piece of askull was found within 6 inches of the
surface. Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (a beaver tooth and four bone points) were taken from
the southern en also the broken spear heads and a conglomerated mass of human
bones. Several ribs were found between two femurs. All the skeletons found
separate (9) were lying with their heads to the west of north.”

From Mrs. B. D. Spencer, Brooklyn, N. Y. (through Dr. H. T. Cresson,
of Philadelphia, forwarded by Prot. F. W. Putnam, of Peabody Museum):
A pyrula shell with an engraving of a mastodon or grand pachyderm,
human and animal teeth, shell beads, bone implements, stone arrow
and spear heads, perforators and scrapers, and a piece of wood, show-
ing. the cutting marks of a stone ax, from the peat and fallen forest
layer and neighboring locality near Holly Oak Station, Philadelphia,
Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, Delaware. These objects were
discovered by Dr. H. T. Cresson and M. Sarault in 1864. Seventy-
nine specimens. (Ace. 24695.)

From R. Forrer, Strasburg, Germany: Thirty-four pieces of pottery
(Samian ware) of Roman manufacture, each one having a hame stamped
upon it; and 25 pieces of Coptic cloth. (Purchased.) The name given
to these has been Coptic eloth, because they were made principally at
the city of Coptos, which was located about halfway between the cities
of Thebes and Panopolis. Thenee this commerce was carried in every
direction both through Egyptand Ethiopia, and these and similar cloths
have been found as far northas Fayum. There are evidences of Greek,
Roman and Byzantine influences. Some of the fabrics were woven in
the loom with shuttles, but others were made as tapestries. They are
usually of flax, though wool is interwoven. Silk was known in that
day, but seemed to have been such a luxury that its use was uncommon.
Some of these cloths have been described by Herodotus and Strabo.
The use of this and similar fabrics made with the loom in Egypt dates
from high antiquity. Many of these are tapestries and woven in the
Same manner as the Gobelins. They were all used as garments and
were the burial dress of their owners, having been exhumed from the
graves of the neighborhood. They date from the first to the seventh
century, A. D. These objects will be described in a separate paper.
(Ace. 24690.)

ROUTINE WORK, CLASSIFICATION AND ARRANGEMENT OF COLLECTION.

This department of the Museum, consisting, as it does, of antiquated
bones, stones, and pottery, much of it in fragments, is not attractive to
the ignorant visitor. Its objects have been known throughout historic
times without exciting public interest. If they have been gathered, it
was from curiosity. All this has been changed by the discovery of pre-
historic man. Now the objects take their proper place as evidence of
the antiquity of man, and are regarded with proper interest aud given
their true value. But this requires an understanding of the objects
and their relation—man and man’s industry. This is explanatory of
the statement that in my department visitors frequently eall upon me
for explanations, and ask my opinion upon objects, sometimes those in
the Museum, at other times those owned and brought by the visitors,
and this adds much to our routine labor. I approve this idea, and have
142 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

always done what I could to satisfy this laudable scientific curiosity on
the part of the public. I remember that this is a Museum for the peo-
ple as well as an organization for the advancement of science.

The number of entries in the loan book during the year was 26. -
Specimens entered in this book are principally sent for examination
and report, sometimes with regard to purchase, but more often classifi-
cation, probable use, ete., is desired. This requires more or less corre-
spondence with the parties sending, and after the report is made, repack-
ing and return of the specimens.

Subject to these explanations, the routine work of former years has
been kept up.

DISTRIBUTION OF DUPLICATE ARCH AOLOGICAL SPECIMENS.

The following statement indicates the distribution of archeological
specimens by the National Museum during the year ending June 30,
1892:

To Herbert E. Brock, Mason City, Lowa; 57 archeological specimens
in exchange for fossils. (Sent July 24, 1891.)

To Mrs. D. B. Meacham, Ridgway avenue, -Amidale, Cincinnati,
Ohio: 17 archeological specimens in exchange. (Sent February 11,
1892.)

To Herbert E. Brock, Mason City, lowa: 50 specimens of arrow and
spearheads, in exchange for Crinoids. (Sent March 23, 1892.)

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS
IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By FrepDERICK W. TRUE, Curator.

As regards the regular work of the department, the year covered by
this report was less productive of results than its predecessors. The
time of the Curator was occupied by other duties for one-third of the year.
The preparations for the World’s Fair were in progress, and arrange-
ments could not be made to secure the services of a skilled assistant
to replace the assistant engaged in field work. As intimated in last
year’s report, it is probable that normal conditions will not return until
after the close of the work for the World’s Fair. In the meantime
little ean be done beyond protecting the collections from deterioration.

In number and importance the accessions will compare favorably with
those of former years.* The principal accessions are here referred to:

Many foreign mammals have been obtained through the continued kindness of the
friends of the Museum, and important additions to the series of American species
have also been made in the same manner, and to a certain degree by purchase.

Dr. W. L. Abbott, to whom the Museum is indebted for a valuable colleetion of
East African mammals, supplemented his donation by a collection from Central Kash-
mir, including a fine series of skins of the Rhesus monkey, a Thibetan bear, and other
interesting species. Mr. William Astor Chanler presented two excellent mounted
heads of giraffes, a male and a female, from East Africa. A very valuable collection of
skins of marsupials, including 12 species of kangaroos and wallabies, was received
from the Australian Museum. Most of these were previously unrepresented in the
Museum collections.

Capt. M. A. Healy, U.S. Revenue Marine, obtained for the Museum the skin of a -
female walrus from Holy Cross Bay, Siberia, an excellent mate for the male obtained
last year by Capt. Coulson. Through the kind oftices of Dr. C. H. Merriam, of the
Department of Agriculture, and Mr. C. A. Townsend, of the U.S. Fish Commission, four
sea lions, Lumetopias stelleri, and two harbor seals were obtained from Monterey, Cal.
Dr. Merriam also aided the Museum in obtaining from Newfoundland three gray
seals, Halicharus grypus, a species rare in American collections. A fine adult male
hooded seal, Cystophora cristata, was obtained by Rev. M. Harvey, of St. Johns,
Newfoundland.

The Mexican Boundary Commission began field work durmeg the year. Dr. Edgar
A. Mearns, U. S. Army, who was appointed surgeon to the Commission, expressed his
desire to make zodlogieal collections for the Museum and was supplied with traps,
preservatives, and other collecting apparatus. He has entered enthusiastically into
the work and sent in from the border large collections of finely prepared specimens.

“No attention is paid at this time to the numerous specimens obtained for the
World’s Fair. These will be mentioned in next year’s report, when a detailed account

of the work done for the exhibition will be submitted.
143
144 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.
As the collections made in this region by the earlier Boundary Survey have largely |
deteriorated, this fresh material is of great interest. :

Mr. P. L. Jouy, who was detailed from the department for field work, made con-
siderable collections during the year in Southern Arizona, and in Sonora and San
Luis Potosi, Mexico. A skin of the coati, Nasua nasica, was obtained by Lieut.
John 8. Winn, U. 8. Army, in the Huachuea Mountains of Arizona. This is one of
the earliest evidences of the presence of this singular animal in the United States.

The Museum was permitted by Capt. W.H. Cassel to obtain in Druid Hill Park,
Baltimore, four Virginia deer—two buck, a doe, and a fawn. The park had become
overstocked, and it was necessary to reduce the number. <A skeleton of the white-
beaked dolphin, Lagenorhynchus albirostris, was received in exchange from Prof.
Robert Collett, of Christiania, Norway. :

The mounted skin of a dolphin, Delphinus delphis, trom Carmel Bay, California,
was purchased.

Specimens of the rare American bats, Macrotus californicus and Promops californi-
cus, were presented by Mr. George A. Allen, Indian agent in Yuma County, Ariz.
Mr. E. L. Storment also presented a specimen of the latter species and one of dAtala-
pha cinerea.

The President deposited in the Museum an armadillo sent him by Mr. R. R. Skaggs,
of Breckenridge, Tex.

A considerable collection of small mammals fromthe vicinity of Fort Snelling,
Minn., was presented by Dr. Mearns. Small mammals from Texas and California,
needed to fill gaps in the study series, were purchased from Mr. C. kK. Worthen, of
Warsaw, III

A nmmber of skeletons of species of riminants and other mammals previously un-
represented in the collections were obtained from the Muséum D’Histoire Naturelle
in exchange.

During the year more than 50 mammals, including a moose, 3 bears, 4 goats, and
other large forms, were received from the National Zodlogical Park. While the loss
of so many animals by the Park is to be regretted, if seems inseparable from enter-
prises of this kind, and isin some degree counterbalanced by the gain to the Museum,

No important changes have taken place in the exhibition hall during
the year, and no groups were added. A few skins were mounted by
the taxidermists, who have had little time, however, to devote to the
regular work of the Museum. The chief addition was a portion of
the Abbott collection, mounted by Ward’s Natural Science Establish-

ment.

The list of new mounted skins is as follows:

White-collared Mangabey, Cercocebus col-
laris.

Common Macaque, Macacus cynomolgus.

Pig-tailed Macaque, Wacacus nemestrinus,

Yagunarundi cat, Melis yaguarundi.

DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS. 145

The regular routine work of the department, identifying specimens,
cataloguing, assorting, and rearranging, was carried on as usual.
For the Department of Agriculture collection, 5,897 skins and 5,884
skulls were catalogued by our clerks. A large number of skulls of
small mammals belonging to this collection were cleaned during the
year, but Jarge numbers remain uncleaned. The Museum also made
up a considerable number of skins of foxes, skunks, coatis, peccaries,
bears, ete., belonging to this series.

No special report on the work of the taxidermists can be made with
advantage at this time. Only two taxidermists were retained on the
Museum roll during the year, and these were engaged for the greater
part of the time in work connected with the World’s Fair exhibits.
Nothing could be done to decrease the number of skins in pickle,
though it is unfortunate that some of them should remain longer
unmounted.

Mr. P. L. Jouy, formerly assistant in the department, was engaged _
in field work during the year. The explorations of Dr. Mearns have
already been referred to.

A few specimens were loaned for study or distributed during the
year. These were: To Dr. J. A. Allen, New York, 3 skins and 5 skulls
of Capromys, for study; to Mr. William Taylor, San Diego, Tex., 5
skulls of North American mammals, in exchange; to Dr. Harrison
Allen, Philadelphia, Pa., 2 skeletons of fruit bats, for study.

Identifications of North American mammals were made for Mr. G.S.
Miller, Jr., of Cambridge, Mass. Mr. G. H. Ragsdale, of Gainesville,
Tex., received information regarding the distinguishing characters of
the various species of American cats.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS
IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By Ropert RIpGWay, Curator.

GENERAL REVIEW OF THE YEAR’S WORK.

In addition to the regular routine work of the department, which of
itself is too complicated to admit of specific description, the following
special work was accomplished during the year. It may be premised
that all such work has been done at irregular intervals, or only when
time could be spared from the more exacting duties of the curator.

The working up of a collection of birds from Honduras and another
from Costa Rica was completed during July, and the results turned in
to the editor of the ** Proceedings” for publication. Considerable work
was also done, as opportunity occurred, on a revision of the genera
Sittasomus and Formicarius, besides other groups, the results of which,
so far as the work has been completed, ave mentioned by title in the
Bibliography (Section Iv).

In August, the transferring of specimens constituting the study col-
lection to new trays was begun, as was also the consideration of plans
for an exhibit of birds at the World’s Columbian Exposition, the cata-
loguing and putting away of the Richmond collection of over 5,000
specimens, the separation of duplicates from the same, and numerous
other matters.

The rearrangement of the study collection in the new cabinets was
continued in September until all the cabinets in the gallery were filled.

In April, a large collection of birds from Cashmir, presented by Dr.
W. L. Abbott, was worked up, involving considerable labor, since most
of the material was entirely new to the Museum. Much work has also
been done on a large collection of birds from the Galapagos Islands.

As time and facilities afforded, a large amount of difficult and Jabori-
ous work was performed in the rearrangement of specimens in the west
basement, where modern cabinets had been substituted for some of the
various kinds of unsuitable cases in which this extremely valuable part
of the collection had been stored. The work is far from finished. how-
ever, and can not be completed until after the World’s Fair exhibit has
been disposed of.

147
148 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

A very considerable part of the curators time was employed in the
consideration of plans and details of execution for an exhibit of birds
at the World’s Columbian Exposition. This matter was embarrassed
by many obstacles, the most serious of which was the extreme difficulty
experienced in securing competent skilled assistants. It was also
found very difficult—in some cases impossible—to obtain the necessary
inaterial; and, owing to the novel character of the work undertaken,
much time was necessarily spent inexperiment. Further time was lost
by illness of assistants; but, all these hindrances taken into considera-
tion, the progress of the work has been satisfactory, and unless the
value of the exhibit is impaired by material reduction of its extent, a
highly interesting and instructive collection will be produced.

NOTES UPON THE MORE IMPORTANT ACCESSIONS RECEIVED DURING
THE YEAR.

The number of specimens entered in the Museum register of birds
during the year 1891-792 is 5,608 (catalogue numbers 120753 to 126349,

ROUTINE WORK.

A considerable part of what might properly be included under this
heading has been already mentioned.

The number of specimens mounted during the year (exclusive of those
mounted for the World’s Fair exhibit) is 276,and of specimens made
into skins, 35. These totals are less than for the year 189091, for the
reason that a considerable portion of the taxidermist’s (Mr. Marshall’s)
time was devoted to work on the World’s Fair exhibit.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES.

Under this heading may be mentioned chiefly the curator’s work upon
collections from Honduras, Costa Rica, the Galapagos Archipelago,
Cashmir, ete., and upon special groups, as the genus Formicarius;
Dr. Stejneger’s upon collections from Japan and the Sandwich Islands;
Mr. J. A. Allen’s on the genus Colaptes, and Mr. Frank M. Chapman’s
upon the Genus Quiscalus. Some of these investigations have not been
concluded; but the results of others have been published. (See biblio-
raphy, Section Lv.)

PRESENT STATE OF THE COLLECTION.

The present state of the collection is considerably improved over that
of last year, _ ‘ving to the far more convenient arrangement of the larger
part in modern cabinets. A considerable portion (much the bulkier
part, though numerically less) has yet to be rearranged, the work having
been retarded by the preparation of the World’s Fair exhibit as well
as by want of cases. It will, however, be resumed at as early a date
as possible, and it is to be hoped that by the end of the current year
the entire study collection may be putin a thoroughly systematic state,
and the duplicates separated and classified, so that by next year an
extensive distribution of sets can be made.

The number of specimens coutained in the collection at the end of
June, 1892, is shown in the following table:

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF OOLOGY
IN THE U.8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By Cuartes E. BeNpIRE, U. 8. Army (retired), Honorary Curator.

Tam pleased to be able to state that the collection is now in excellent
shape, easy of access, and reasonably safe from insects and vermin.
During the past year thirty new quarter unit zinc-lined and insect- proof
cases have been furnished for its accommodation, and the entire collec-
tion has been carefully overhauled, rearranged, and relabeled. The
majority of the specimens now on hand in the reserve collection are in
an excellent state of preservation, and as at present cared for will re-
main so.

The exhibit of nests and eggs in the main hall of the Smithsonian
Institution could now be materially increased, if more.room was avail-
able for this purpose.

The most important contributions to the collection -during the year
are as follows:

Dr. Wm. L. Ralph, 26 Court street, Utica, N. Y., a magnificent collection, consist-
ing of 444 sets of eggs, representing 194 species and 1,630 specimens. Among
these are several species new to the collection; many others are very rare and
have been especial desiderata for years, and all are beautifully prepared.  Ac-
companying these eges are 100 nests, also in an excellent state of preservation.
This collection is by far the most valuable gift received since I have been in
charge of the department.

Mr. R. MacFarlane, chief factor, Hudson Bay Company, Cumberland House, Sas-
katchewan, Canada, an interesting collection of 59 sets of eggs represented by
225 specimens and 30 nests. This donation is of considerable scientific value, as
it extends the breeding range of several species considerably to the northward.

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C., a valuable collection, consist-
ing of 40 sets, 113 specimens, and 17 nests. from the Death Valley region im south-
ern California, Nevada, and Utah, and containing a number of rare specimens.

Interesting accessions have also been received as follows:

Mr. Guy E. Mitchell, Washington, D.C., a local collection, consisting of 59 sets and
239 specimens.

Mr. Walter F. Webb, Geneva, N. Y., 39 sets, numbering 137 specimens and 10 nests.

Assist? Surg. Edgar A. Mearns, U.S. Army, Fort Snelling, Minn., 46 sets, number-
ing 177 specimens and 20 nests.

U.S. Fish Commission (Washington, D. C.), 9 sets, 29specimens, and 2 nests.

Mr. Charles Littlejohn, Redwood City, Cal., 21 sets, 42 specimens, and 1 nest,

Mr. H. P. Attwater, Rockport, Aransas County, Tex., 11 sets, 56 eggs, and 3 nests.

In addition to these donations 37 specimens, representing 7 species, were purchased
during the year.

The routine work has consisted in recording, marking, measuring,
and arranging 2,919 specimens received during the year, and placing
them in their proper order in the reserve collection. Also revising and
rearranging in numerical order 382 register sheets, showing the present
status of the collection, and overhauling and rearranging the collection
of nests.

The curator has also been engaged in reading proof of Vol. 1, Life
Histories of North American Birds, ete., compiling the index for this
volume, and in gathering material for another volume. Twenty-nine
lots of eggs sent tor identification have been reported on.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By LEONHARD STEJNEGER, Curator.

The herpetological department has every reason to look upon the
year 1891-92 with satisfaction. The number of accessions was larger
than during any previous year, 1,055 specimens having been entered,*
and the material was not inferior, nor were the collections of less in-
terest. Several very interesting species were added to the collection,
some very rare or for the first time, others hitherto undescribed.
Among the latter I would call special attention to a very remarkable
blind cave salamander, discovered by Mr. F. A. Sampson in the Rock
House Cave, Missouri, and described by me as Typhlotriton speleus.
It is related to Desmognathus, but its eyes; by disuse, have become
non-functional; the eyelids closed over and grew together, and now
there is only a shallow furrow and a dark spot left to designate ex-
ternally the place of the eye. The Proteus, from the grottoes in Kaern-
then, Austria, is the only other batrachian hitherto known to be blind
in the same way, but it belongs to a different order, and Typhlotriton
is so far the only known blind salamander. Of rare species L may
mention a fine specimen of Plethodon a@neus, from South Pittsburg,
Tenn., transmitted by Mr. R. Morton Middleton, and several specimens
of another salamander recently described, viz, Spelerpes maculicaudus,
received from Dr. O. P. Hay, and from Messrs. Frederick C. Test and
George E. Harris. The principal accessions will, however, be referred
to further on.

The work in the department has consisted chiefly of routine work,
installing, identifying, caring for, labeling, and reporting upon collec-
tions as they have arrived. The curator has attempted some work
upon certain groups and upon the geographical distribution of the
reptiles in the southwestern portion of the country, but a consistent
and steady systematic work has been out of the question.

At the beginning of the last fiscal year it was decided to take up
the many collections received during the last ten years and stored in

*For comparison it may be mentioned that the number of entries in 1890—91 was
908; in 1889-’90, 705; in 1888-89, 784; 1m 1887-’88, 19; in 1886-’87, 138.

156 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

bulk. As soon as jars and alcohol had been provided, the work of as-
sorting and labeling was begun, and has continued steadily at such
times as could be spared from the daily routine work. The work is
slow, involving, as it does, not only the labor of handling, consulting
the records, labeling, and card-cataloguing, but also a great deal of
identifying.

Some time has been spent in preparations for a herpetological dis-
play at the World’s Columbian Exposition. Thanks to Mr. Benedict’s
experiments, a plastic and pliable substitute for plaster was obtained
for making the casts of reptiles and batrachians.

By tar the most valuable and interesting collection, not only of
the year, but since the Wheeler Survey west of the one hundredth
meridian in the seventies, and ranking with those of the famous old
exploring expeditions in the West, is the material received from Dr. C.
Hart Merriam, through the United States Department of Agriculture,
and collected by him and his parties during the so-called “ Death Val-
ley Expedition,” 1891. It consists of more than 900 specinens (only a
small portion, however, having been entered on the register before the
end of the year), chiefly from the desert regions of California and
Nevada, but many also from Utah, and quite a number from the great
interior basin of California. A special report upon this collection has
been prepared by the curator.

In addition to the collections mentioned in last year’s report, as made
by Mr. P. L. Jouy in southern Arizona, quite a number of specimens
were received from him during the present fiscal year. The excellent
quality of his collections and of his field observations are quite as
inarked in the latter as in the former.

From the same souree the Museum procured the only extra-limital
collection worth mentioning, viz, a number of reptiles and batrach-
ians collected by Mr. Jouy during his stay in Korea several years ago.
Very little is known of the herpetology of that rather inaccessible
country, and the collection is therefore one of unusual interest.

The type specimen of Typhlotriton speleus, the blind cave salaman-
der, presented by Mr. F. A. Sampson, of Sedalia, Mo., has already been
mentioned, but I may add that we are indebted to Mr. George EK, Harris,
of Cassville, Mo., for numerous larvee of the same interesting species.

Many other valuable and interesting species have been received dur-
ing the year from various correspondents, which can not be enumerated
in detail in the present connection, but among the more prominent con-
tributors the following deserve mention: Herbert Brown, Tucson,
Ariz.; Prof. B. W. Evermann, through U. 8. Fish Commission; J. D.
Figgins, Washington, D. C.; Dr. O. P. Hay, Irvington, Ind.; H. W.
Henshaw, Washington, D. C.; Julius Hurter, St. Louis, Mo.; It. Mor-
ton Middleton, South Pittsburg, Tenn.; Charles W. Richmond, Wash-
ington, D. C.; N. P. Scudder, Linden, Md.; Edgar Storment, Tempe,
Ariz.; Dr. Timothy E. Wilcox, U. 8. A., Fort Huachuca, Ariz.
DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS. US Y/

Facilities for studying the collections, so far as they were accessible,
have been extended toseveral gentlemen not connected with the Museum.
Dr. O. P. Hay spent more than a month in the department study-
ing the reptiles of Indiana. Dr. G. Baur, of Clark University, Wor-
cester, Mass., spent considerable time at the Museum working up
the collection of Chelonians for his proposed work on the tortoises of
North America, to be published by the Museum.

The work on the proposed supplementary volume of the “ Nomenclator
Zoologicus” has advanced satisfactorily. The genera and subgenera
recorded in the Zodlogical Records for 1879-1889 have been card-cata-
logued during the year, and the work of indexing the additional names
contained in the Zoologische Jahresberichte has been commenced.

Mr. Frederick ©. Test has been employed as an aid to the department
during the entire year. One half of his time has been devoted to work
on the Nomenclator Zoologicus, the other half chiefly to routine work
in the department.

During the year that part of the Museum collection which was
brought home by the naturalists of the U.S. Fish Commission steamer
Albatross from the Galapagos Islands was recalled from Prof. Cope.
A large quantity of material is, however, still in his possession, and an
accurate census of the herpetological specimens of the Museum is there-
fore as impracticable as it was last year. Like that presented a year
ago, the following estimate has been prepared in this way: taking last
year’s estimate as a basis, those specimens which have been disposed
of by exchange, or otherwise, have been deducted, and those which
have been catalogued during the fiscal year have been added. Such
an estimate shows the status of the collection on June 30, 1892, to be
as follows:

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FISHES
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892,

By TARLETON H. BEAN, Honorary Curator.

The work accomplished in this department has been in many respects
generally similar to that of preceding years. My own duties in con-
nection with the U.S. Fish Commission have rendered 1t impossible
for me to devote much time to Museum matters, and the routine work
of the department has devolved almost entirely upon Mr. Barton A.
Bean, assistant curator. .

The curator has assisted Dr. Goode in the preparation of a bulletin
upon the deep-sea fishes contained in the U.S. National Museum, and
the work was pushed rapidly forward during the fall of 1891.

Several hundred skeletons of fishes were prepared for the depart-
ment by Mr. E. KE. Howell. These have been turned over to Dr. Theo-
dore Gill, temporarily, for study.

There has been a marked increase in the number of letters received
through the Assistant Secretary’s office. These for the most part con-
tain queries concerning the fishes of various portions of the country,
and the questions as a rule have been promptly answered. Others
bring information of much importance concerning fishes and their life
histories. Intelligent correspondents are much desired, and the policy
of encouragement to such is strongly recommended.

A number of students examined materials belonging to the Museum
(Drs. Gill, Jordan, Gilbert, EKigenmann, Smith, and Profs. Evermann,
Hay, and others). Collections and papers based upon the same were
received from numerous correspondents, a list of which will be found
in the Bibliography (Section Tv).

Quite a large number of drawings of deep-sea fishes have been made
by Mr. A. H. Baldwin. An important addition to the sectional library
was made by the purchase of four volumes of Dr. Bleeker’s ‘“ Atlas
Ichthyologique,” which completes the set of that work.

The explorations here referred to resulted in the addition of impor-
tant collections of fishes for the National Museum:

The U.S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross cruised in the North
Pacific and Bering Sea during the summer of 1891 and the spring of
1892. During the winter of 1891 and 1892 the vessel was engaged in
the survey of a cable route from California to the Sandwich Islands.
On these cruises collections of fishes were made.

159
160 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

The steamer Fish Tawhk was engaged in the lower Chesapeake Bay,
where small collections were obtained.

The schooner Grampus did general collecting in the lower Chesa-
peake and in the coast waters adjacent thereto.

Prot. B. W. Evermann, for the U. 8S. Fish Commission, collected
fishes in Montana and Wyoming during July and August, 1891,

Profs. J. T. Scovell and A. J. Woolman made some collections in
northern Mexico during August, 1891. Mr. P. L. Jouy collected in
Mexico (Lake Chapala, principally), in February and April, 1892.

Mr. Charles W. Richmond sent from Nicaragua collections made in
February, March and April, 1892.

The total number of packages sent out during the year, not including
the sets of duplicate fishes, was twenty-four. The most important were:

Thirty-seven species of deep-sea fishes to the Royal Museum of
Copenhagen, Denmark, in exchange; a large series of fishes to be skele-
tohized; and seven species of Seopelids and a tile-fish to the Museum
of Comparative Zodlogy at Cambridge, Mass.

Fifty-five sets of duplicate fishes were prepared and turned over to
the registrar. The specimens were all carefully wrapped, and each set
contained about 125 species, both fresh and salt water forms. <A list to
accompany each set was printed.

The number of specimens added to the collections of fishes during
the year was 1,906. The first entry in the register was No. 43603, the
last 44156, making a total of 555 entries.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS
(INCLUDING CENOZOIC FOSSILS)
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By WiLLiAM H. DaLi, Honorary Curator.

The force of the Department of Mollusks during the past year has
comprised, besides the honorary curator, Mr, Charles Torrey Simpson,
aid, Mr. S. Hazen Bond, copyist, and Miss N. C. Beard, copyist. Dr.
R. E. C. Stearns, of the U. S. Geological Survey, honorary adjunct
curator, has been absent on sick leave during nearly the whole year,
so that we have not had the advantage of his valuable aid and advice
in the work of the department. The three persons mentioned above
have comprised the salaried force of the department. Mr. Gilbert D.
Harris and Mr, Frank Burns, of the U.S. Geological Survey, in the
course of their work on the tertiary invertebrate fossils, have rendered
incidental assistance on that part of the collection. The writer, with
the permission of the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, has con-
tinued to act as honorary curator.

The members of the force have been diligent, faithful, and accurate
in their work, and My. Simpson especially has devoted much time out-
side of ordinary office hours to forwarding the work of the department
and assisting its numerous correspondents. ;

GENERAL OPERATIONS.

The routine work of the year has made considerable progress. The
number of registrations which are tabulated in another place in this
report is less numerous than for some years previous, because more time
has been devoted to putting the collection of duplicates in order and to
other matters set forth below. As the arrears of material not admin-
istered upon have been reduced, the number of duplicates has increased,
and it has for some time been obvious that in order to make the ex-
changes often called for, and to keep informed as to the state of duplicate
material, it was urgently required that the latter should be putin order
for reference. Much of the time of Mr. Simpson and Mr. Bond has been
devoted to sorting, naming, cataloguing, and putting away the duplicate

163

shells in numbered boxes. A large proportion of the duplicates is now
packed in small boxes in the storage-room, each bearing its catalogue
number, the last box entry being No. 2035, while a card-catalogue,
alphabetically arranged under the names of the species, makes it possi-
ble to refer at a moment’s notice to any duplicates in the collection.
Some few marine collections remain to be reviewed and the duplicates
eliminated, but the great mass of duplicate recent and fossil shells are
now arranged in orderly and accessible condition, occupying over 1,700
boxes, each plainly marked with its registration number and name.

The drawings, published and unpublished, are becoming so numer-
ous that here also cataloguing and arrangement have become necessary.
A list.in the form of a card-catalogue, had been made of all the wood.
cuts and stereotypes of mollusks illustrated in the Smithsonian Reports
and in the Proceedings and Bulletins of the Museum (with certain excep-
tions). Stout manilla envelopes, of the same size as the standard library
card, have been used to contain original drawings, whether published
or unpublished, while in a blank form, stamped on the outside of the
envelope, is noted the catalogue number of the drawing, the registra-
tion number (in the Museum register), name, and provenance of the
specimen from which the drawimg was made, together with the publi-
cation, volume, plate, figure, number, and page reference of the engrav-
ing made from the drawing, if published. The latter data are entered
on library cards in cases where the engraving exists, but the drawing
is notextant. These cards and envelopes are arranged together alpha-
betically under the name of the species, in two series, one comprising
the published and the other the unpublished drawings, so that refer-
ence can be had immediately to the data relating to any species which
have been drawn, or of which a figure has been published in the publi-
cations of the Museum or of the Smithsonian Institution. The excep-
tions to this comprise the figures which have appeared in Bulletin 37,
U.S. National Museum, which contains over a thousand figures; those
figures which are contained in the series of Smithsonian manuals of
land and fresh-water shells in the Miscellaneous Collections of the Insti-
tution, and a set of stereotype figures derived from the British Museum
publications. As the cuts above named are indexed in the publications
referred to, and thus easily reached, it was not thought worth while
to undertake the considerable labor of adding them to the catalogue
until other more pressing matters are out of the way.

The amount of labor involved in these various directions can be
better appreciated if placed in tabular form as follows:

Tt will be observed that this is equal to 5,171 registrations, so far as
the clerical labor is concerned, and if we add to it the regular entries
for the year in the Museum Register, we have a total of about 7,700
entries as against about 5,800 for 1890-91. As the staff, by reason of
Dr. Stearns’ absence was diminished by one person, the equivalent at
the lowest estimate of 25 per cent of its efficiency, this record may be
regarded as satisfactory.

Besides the work above referred to, the general operations of the
department comprise the preparation of special reports on collections
made under governmental auspices by various organizations, such as
the Fish Commission, the Navy, the Revenue Marine, the Agricultural
Department, and special expeditions. In this line various papers have
been printed by the writer and other members of the staff, a reference
to which will be found in the Bibliography (Section rv). Among them
is a paper forming Part G of Bulletin 59 of the U.S. National Museum,
containing instructions for collecting and preserving mollusks, notes
on the arrangement, outfit, and cataloguing of collections, and the con-
struction of dredges. This it is thought will be of use to collectors be-
ginning work on the Mollusca, and will save much clerical work in
writing out such instructions at short notice, as has been required fre-
quently in the past on the starting of expeditions undertaking natural
history work.

ACCESSIONS.

The number of accesssions during 1891~92 was 85, against 79 in
189091. Severalof them comprised large series of valuable and inter-
esting forms, many of which are new to the collection. Among the
most interesting the following may be noted:

From Mr. C. F. Ancey were received a number of rare and peculiar species from
Africa, including several of the forms found only in the south African Lake Tangan-
yika.

Mr. W. G. Binney presented the blocks of figures used in his publications of the
past two years, thus making them available for use in future publications of the
Museum.

Mr. R. W. Brown, of Washington, has continued to present to the Museum the
numerous land-snails, ete., which are found from time to time in his importations of
foreign fruit, so that we have had the opportunity of observing in a living state in
an improvised snailery, several of the peculiar types of Antillean pulmonates.

The heirs of the late Oliver N. Bryan, of Marshall Hall, Md., in accordance with
his wish presented his collection of fossils, Indian relies, ete., to the National Mu-
seum, by which quite a number of fine and interesting fossil mollusks fell to the share
of this department.

To Dr. J. C. Cox, of Sydney, New South Wales, through Mr. Charles Hedley of the
Australianmuseum, weare indebted for alcoholic specimens of the remarkable Ephip-
podonta Macdougallii Tate, a bivalve related to Galeomma and on which an investi-
gation of its anatomy may be based.

Through Mr. Hugh Fulton, of London, by exchange and purchase a number of rari-
ties not otherwise obtainable have been received, including a fine specimen of the
extremely rare Voluta aulica which formerly belonged to the Barelay collection.
166 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

From Mr. I. Greegor, of Jacksonville, Fla., a number of interesting specimens have
been received, mostly from Florida and the Antilles.

Mr. Simpson, of the department of mollusks, joined Mr. J. B. Henderson, jr., on an
expedition to the west coast of Florida, which proved fruitful in results. A series of
the specimens collected, so far as they might be useful to the Museum, was presented
by Mr. Henderson.

Two large series of Japanese mollusks have been received during the year. These
accessions greatly enrich that department of the collection, each containing several
rarities which were not comprised in the other. One of these was the gift of the
Rey. H. Loomis, of Yokohama, and the other was received in exchange for other
specimens sent to Frederick Stearns, esq., of Detroit, Mich., who supplemented it by
other forms from Mauritius and the Hawaiian Islands.

Another gift which is highly appreciated was a set of several hundred species from
St. Helena, probably illustrating the whole of its mollusk fauna, including the curious
extinct land shells. This very interesting contribution was received from Capt.
W.H. Turton, of the Royal Engineers, Chatham, England. The collection of which
chis is a representative set was reported on at length by Mr. E. A. Smith, of the Brit-
ish Museum.

The extinct fresh-water mollusk fauna of the Colorado desert has always been of
great interest. One by one the species have been found living in springs, to which
they retreated on the desiccation of the ancient lake. One alone remained to be dis-
covered, Tryonia clathrata of Stimpson; and among the collections of the expedition
to Death Valley made by Dr. C. Hart Merriam under the auspices of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture this has been at last secured, living in a spring with a
water temperature of 97° F. in the Pahranagat Valley. This is certainly one of the
most interesting malacological events of the year.

Through the efforts of the Hon. Rounsevelle Wildman, United States consul at
Singapore, a collection representing the chief marine forms of that vicinity was
obtained from native collectors.

Mr. Joseph Willcox, of Philadelphia, has continued to contribute to the collection
of Tertiary fossils, and has enriched it by a number of species from the Tertiaries of
the Carolinas and Florida.

ASSISTANCE TO STUDENTS.

The work of assisting students in various parts of the country to
identify their local faunze, to intelligently direct their studies, and
answer their numerous queries on various branches of the subject, has
always been regarded as an important function of this department, and
has been frequently referred to in the previous reports. Correspondence
of this kind was kept up in 1890-91 with 160 persons, involving over 300
letters and between 600 and 700 pages of writing, besides the identifica-
tion of about 1,200 species of mollusks. In 1891-’92 the number of cor-
respondents was 114, and the number of pages of writing involved in
the correspondence 820. The number of species identified for various
students, chiefly by Mr. Simpson, under my direction, amounts to con-
siderably over 3,000, for each of which a label had to be written.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES.

A reference to the Bibliography (section Iv) will indicate the direc-
tion of the studies carried on during the year. The report on the later
Tertiary of the United States and Mr. Simpson’s paper on Floridian
DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS. 167

Unios, though printed, will be issued a few days too late to appear in
the Bibliography of this year. The principal labor of the year has been
bestowed on the continuation of the report on the Florida Tertiary Mol-
lusks, for the Wagner Institute, of Philadelphia; preliminary work on
the mollusks of the Galapagos trip of the U.S. Fish Commission
steamer Albatross, and also those collected by Dr. G. Baur; and on the
Unionide, to which group Mr. Simpson is giving special attention.

STATE OF THE COLLECTION.

In previous reports I have explained why it is not yet possible to
give the exact number of species, specimens, duplicates, ete., contained
in the collection under my charge. In my last report it was estimated
that the collection contained about 476,500 specimens, of which one-
fourth are preserved in alcohol. During the year about 6,225 speci-
mens have been received, which would make a present total of about
482,725 specimens contained in the collection. The number of entries
in the register for 1891-92 was 2,546, as is Shown in the accompanying
table.

The total number of registrations to date, deducting all duplications
and omissions in the register, is 103,113, representing about 309,000
specimens. The number of workers and their distribution in different
parts of the building renders it necessary to use simultaneously several
volumes of the register. This explains why the preceding table is nec-
essary in order to show the total registrations for the year. The formal
registrations (with the gaps alluded to) terminates June 30, 1892, with
number 124,662.
REPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VERTEBRATE FOSSILS
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By 0. C. Marsu, Honorary Curator.

The most important event in this department of the Museum during
the past year has been the accession of a large collection of vertebrate
fossils from the West. secured by the honorary curator during his
official work for the U. S. Geological Survey. These specimens were
prepared in New Haven, sent to the National Museam in July, 1891,
and placed at once on exhibition, so as to be accessible to the members
of the International Geological Congress, which met in Washington
in August of that year. This collection of fossils, which is more exten-
sive and important than any other hitherto received by the Museum,
is arranged in a wall-case especially constructed for it, extending the
entire length of the east side of the exhibition room.

These specimens, selected by the honorary curator as the first instal-
ment of his official collections to be placed in the National Museum,
are all of large size, and especially characteristic of three important
geological horizons of the West. The ceratops beds of the upper Cre-
taceous of Wyoming are here represented by three skulls and other
rare remains of the gigantic horned dinosaurs recently deseribed, and
among these fossils is the type of Triceratops elatus Marsh. From the
Brontotherium beds of Nebraska and Dakota is shown a very complete
series of skulls and portions of skeletons of the huge Miocene mam-
mals of the family Brontotheride. This series contains ten good skulls
representing several genera, and is by far the most important collee-
tion of the group ever placed on exhibition. The horizon of the Plio-
cene, known as the Pliohippus beds, is likewise represented by skulls
and other remains of extinct species of the Rhinoceros family, espe-
cially of the genus Aceratherium, all from Phillips County, Kans. A
few other Tertiary fossils and some rare casts are included in this eol-
lection, but the limited space available prevented the exhibition of a
more extensive series.

This collection, when sent from New Haven in 33 boxes, weighed
6,860 pounds. It has now been catalogued and well arranged by Mr.
F. A. Lucas, assistant curator, whose services in other respects have

169
170 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

been of great value to the department. The catalogue numbers em-
bracing this collection extend from 1201 to 1582, as recorded in the
National Museum register of vertebrate fossils. The greater part of
this collection was obtained by Mr. J. B. Hatcher, and a careful record
of all the localities has been preserved.

Another important collection of 72 large boxes of vertebrate fossils,
sent from New Haven in 1886 by the honorary curator, still remains in
storage, as there is no room for its exhibition in the National Museum
The Smithsonian numbers of these boxes are 6601 to 6672.

The honorary curator of this department has recommended to the
director of the Museum that other wall-cases for vertebrate fossils be
constructed on the three remaining sides of the exhibition room, as this
space will be needed eventually, if the specimens already secured and
now under investigation are all placed on exhibition. One side could
then appropriately be devoted to the extinet reptiles of the Triassic
and Jurassic, another to those from the Cretaceous, while the third
and fourth would be required for the vertebrate fossils of the Tertiary
alone.

During the past year the honorary curator of this department has
published a number of papers relating, in part, to the collections above
described, but these publications belong more appropriately to his
work in connection with the U. S. Geological Survey. In two memoirs
now in preparation, however, he will give full descriptions of the more
important specimens he has recently deposited in the National Museum.

The collection of vertebrate fossils, which has been catalogued partly
with the osteological specimens and partly in a separate book, has
been recatalogued during the year in a volume specially devoted to
vertebrate fossils.

During the year 1,124 catalogue entries were made, and 1,061 speci-
mens were added to the collection.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS IN
THE U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By C. V. RILEY, Honorary Curator.

Although most of the time during the past fiscal year has been
devoted to the study collections in the laboratory, some improvements
have been made in the exhibit collections, especially in the systematic
series, where numerous illustrations and specimens have been added,
making it almost complete.

ACCESSIONS.

Many important accessions have been received during the year,
among which the following may be mentioned:

(1) One hundred and thirty-five species in about 400 specimens of Heteroptera,
collected in various parts of the world, authoritatively named, from Prof. A. L. Mon-
tandon, Bucarest, Roumania (Ace, 24579, 25244, and 25520). These have in part been
paid for by exchange.

(2) Series of Californian insects, collected by Mr. D. W. Coquillet, of Los Angeles,
Cal., and transferred to the Museum collection by the curator, as follows: Diptera,
23 species in 182 specimens (Types); Coleoptera, about 100 species in 720 specimens ;
Orthoptera, 35 species in 116 specimens; Hymenoptera, 109 species in 400 specimens;
Homoptera, 40 species in 200 specimens; Hemiptera, 107 species in 575 specimens;
Lepidoptera, 56 species in 159 specimens; Neuroptera, 17 species in 43 specimens;

the largest acquisition of tropical butterflies ever made by the Museum. It was
obtained by exchange for a corresponding number of North American Coleoptera
from our duplicate series, that were new to Mr. Beyer’s collection. This one and
the previous accession are the most valuable during the year. (Acc. 25378.)

(5) Collection of Aculeate Hymenoptera, about 4,000 specimens of 675 North Ameri-
can species (including types of 25 species described by Mr. William Fox), and 100
exotic species from Mr. William Fox, Academy Natural Sciences, Philadelphia. Pur-
chased by the Museum. (Ace. 25769.)

(6) Collection of insects of all orders, made by Mr. H. F. Wickham in the North-
western States, British Columbia, and Alaska. About 1,200 specimens, transferred

Ariz. (Acc, 24915.)

Numerous valuable specimens have been added to the collections
without accession numbers by the curator and his assistants.

As atemporary accession may be mentioned a large collection of West
Indian Hemiptera and parasitic Hymenoptera, sent to the curator for
systematic study by the West India Committee of the British Museum,

lowing:

(a) A series of 57 species of Scolytidae for Dr. Wm. Eichhoff, Stras-
burg, Germany, in return for Ace. 25498.

(b) A series of 35 species of Scolytide for A. D. Hopkins, Morgan-
town, W. Va.

(c) A series of 900 species of Coleoptera for Mr. G, Beyer, New York,
in return for Ace, 25378.

(d) A series of Hemiptera for Prof. A. I. Montandon, Bucharest,
Roumania.

(e) A series of 24 species of Coleoptera for Mr. F. C. Bowditch,
Brookline, Mass., in return for Ace. 25593.

(f) Sixty-nine species of Elateride for Mr. H.de Buysson, Chateau
de Vernet, Allier, Irance.

(2) Reporting on accessions sent for examination and report. One hun-
dred and seventy-two of these reports have been made duving the year.
DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS. 3

(3) The naming of specimens for collectors. Fifty-two larger and
smaller series of insects of all orders have been identified for corre-
spondents, representing about 5,000 species.

(4) The selection of material to be sent to specialists for study and
determination, as here indicated :

(a) A series of Californian Hemiptera-Heteroptera has been sent to
Prof. A. L. Montandon of Bucarest, Roumania.

(b) The material in the Noctuid genera Xylomiges and Cucullia was
sent to Prof. J. B. Smith, New Brunswick, N. J., to assist him in his
study of these groups.

(c) A series of Geometridxe, mostly collected in the Death Valley,
California, was sent to Dr. A. 8. Packard, of Providence, for determina-
tion.

(d) A small series of Diurnals was sent to Mr. W. H. Edwards for
determination.

(e) Several smaller series and all the Odonata, collected by Dr. Ab-
bott in Africa, have been sent to Dr. P. C. Calvert, Academy Natura
Sciences, Philadelphia, for systematic study.

(f) A complete representation of the Museum collection in the Rhyn-
chophorus Tribe Barini has been sent to Capt. T. L. Casey, New York,
who has undertaken to monograph the group.

(g) A series of Geometride bas been sent to Rev. George D. Hulst,
Brooklyn, N. Y., for identification.

(h) All the material in the Hemipterous family Veliide has been
borrowed by Mr. H. E. Summers for study.

(t) The undetermined Lepidoptera collected in Africa by Dr. W. L.
Abbott have been sent to Dr. W. J. Holland, Pittsburg, Pa., for study.
(5) The work of arranging in permanent shape all the collections.

In the Diptera, mentioned in the last annual report as being for the
most part arranged, the remaining families have been classified as far
as they are studied in our fauna. In the Lepidoptera the North Ameri-
can Diurnals, Sphingid, Bombyecid, and Geometrid families have been
completely rearranged according to the last published classification,
and the very large accessions incorporated. Of North American Diur-
nals 410 species are represented, and of Geometrids about 290 North
American and 162 European species. A systematic arrangement has
also been made of the tropical Diurnals, and they are represented as
follows:

In the Hymenoptera some of the families have been studied and the
accessions incorporated.

Much time is taken up by this work, as a large percentage of the acces-
sions arrive unmounted and all have to be labeled before distribution
in the collections.

RESEARCHES.

Most of the special researches based upon museum material are
mentioned under the paragraph relating to routine work. In addi-
tion to these, however, Mr. W. H. Ashmead has completed his mon-
ograph of the Proctotrypide of North America, based very largely
on Museum material. This is the first monograph written upon the
American representations of this group.

Dr. George Marx has had at his disposal the Acarians of the family.
Ixodidie, belonging to the collection, and is engaged upon a monograph
of the family.

PRESENT STATE OF THE COLLECTION.

During the last year about 16,000 specimens have been added to the
collection. The last catalogue entry for June, 1891, is 746, and for
June, 1892, is 1,041. The whole collection was carefully examined for
museum pests during the month of June, and was found to be ina
highly satisfactory condition.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES
IN THE U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892,

By RICHARD RATHBUN, Honorary Curator.

Much progress has been made during the past year in the study of the
collections belonging to this department, especially of the higher crusta-
ceans, and in the preparation of reports relating to them. As the west
hall of the Smithsonian Institution has remained closed during this
entire period, owing to delays in the completion of the repairs, it has
not been possible to take any active steps toward the improvement of
the exhibition series, although a very fair display has been maintained
in the temporary quarters allotted for this purpose in the fish hall ad-
jacent. There has been a marked increase over the previous year in
the number as well as in the aggregate extent and value of the acces-
sions which have been received from many diverse sources. Much
time has necessarily been required in caring for these additions, and in
attending to the continued preservation of the general collections,
which have now attained so large a size as to severely tax the storage
accommodations assigned to them. But few changes have been made
in the quarters occupied by this department, and they remain there-
fore in essentially the same condition as described in the last report.

The curator has exercised only a general supervision over the affairs
of the department, leaving to the assistant curator, Mr. James E. Bene-
dict, and to Miss M. J. Rathbun, the burden of the work, which has been
attended to, as heretofore, in the most thorough and conscientious
manner.

The total number of accessions received was forty-six. The largest
contribution was made by the U.S. Fish Commission and consisted
mainly of crustaceans, chiefly brachyura and anomoura, represented by
many species and a very large number of specimens, the same having
been collected by the steamer Albatross in the North Pacific Ocean
and Bering Sea; by the steamer Fish Hawk and the schooner Grampus
on the Atlantic sea coast, and by Prof. B. W. Evermann in Texas. It
also included a small collection of avian entozoa made by Prof. Edwin
Linton in the Yellowstone National Park.

175
176 | REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

The other more important accessions were the followmg: From the
Australian Museum, Sydney, New South Wales, 24 species of Aus-
tralian echini, 14 of which were new to our collection, 13 species of As-
teroidea and 50 species of brachyura and anomoura; the Rev. Ganon A.
M. Norman, of England, 22 species of European Paguridie and Pyeno-
gonidie; Mr. George S. Brady, England, a named series of British fresh-
water Cyclopide; Rev. H. Loomis, a large dried collection of erusta-
ceans, echinoderms and sponges, from Japan; the Otago Museum, Dune-
din, a collection of New Zealand crustaceans; Mr. John Murray, Edin-
burgh, Scotland, many specimens of hermit crabs, Hupagurus, from the
Firth of Clyde; Mr. P. L. Jouy, a number of fresh-water crabs and
crayfishes from Lake Chapala, Mexico, and crustaceans, echini, and
worms from Guaymas; Dr. T. H. Morgan, of Bryn Mawr College, a coL
lection of crustaceans from Jamaica; O. F. Cook and H. R. Jaquay, a
series of Oniscidie from different parts of the United States; the King-
ston Exposition, Kingston, Jamaica, a large and very fine series of
dried specimens of commercial sponges; J. C. Henderson, jr., and C. T.
Simpson, a miscellaneous assortment of crustaceans from the west coast
of Florida; Lieut. F. E. Sawyer, U.S. Navy, Brazilian crustaceans ob-
tained during a trip in connection with the World’s Columbian Expo-
sition. The remaining contributions, while of smaller size than those
enumerated, have also added many valuable specimens to the collection.

Two half-unit upright cases filled with large jars of especially inter-
esting alcoholic specimens, such as crinoids, deep-sea pennatule, echi-
noderms, and crabs, have been added to the exhibition series in the fish
hall, and Mr. Benedict has also experimented in the matter of making
dried preparations of crustaceans for display purposes. This it is not
generally difficult to accomplish with the brachyurans or true crabs, but
the hermit crabs and shrimps are less amenable to such treatment, owing
to their thinner shells and more delicate appendages. It is expected,
however, that entirely satisfactory specimens can be prepared by care-
ful treatment, and if the trials now being made turn out successfully it is
proposed to increase the display collection. Another direction in which
experimental work is being conducted by Mr. Benedict has reference to
the manufacture of a plastic substance suitable for making reproduce-
tions of the softer animals and sufficiently durable for exhibition pur-
poses. His eftorts have already met with much success and promise im-
portant results not only for this, but also for several of the other de-
partments of the Museum.

The customary routine work of the department, such as the mainte-
nance of the collections, the periodical overhauling of all the speci-
mens to insure their preservation by the renewal of alcohol or the
removal of Museum pests, the assorting of recent additions, their cata-
loguing, labeling, ete., has been regularly attended to, and has occu-
pied a very large amount of time. In the course of all systematic
studies the specimens of each species regarded as duplicates have been

separated at once from the reserve series, and the material for prepar-
ing new sets for distribution to educational institutions has therefore
been gradually accumulating. Many such special sets have also been
made up and disposed of as explained elsewhere. Much of the mate-
rial in the line of marine invertebrates derived from the recent inves-
tigations of the Fish Commission has been assorted in this department,
and several of the groups which are still unassigned for study have
likewise been stored here. Progress has been made with the card or
reference catalogue corresponding with the work in the identification
of species, and so far as the collections are determined, it forms a con-
venient index to them. Collections of crustaceans borrowed from
Union College and the Peabody Museum of Yale University for pur-
poses of comparison have been returned to these institutions.

Some steps have been taken toward preparing an exhibition illus-
trating the scope of this department for the World’s Columbian Expo-
sition. These have consisted mainly in determining the family groups
represented by the known American marine invertebrates and in ascer-
taining our desiderata in that respect. No more instructive exhibit
for the use of biological students could be planned than one contain-
ing essentially all of these families, suitably displayed, and with accom-
panying descriptive labels.

The amount of cataloguing done during the year is explained in the

Mr. Benedict and Miss Rathbun have completed and published in the
proceedings of the Museum a monograph upon the genus Panopeus of
crabs, which is represented in the Museum collection by 25 species, of
which 6 were previously undescribed. The hermit crabs belonging to
the genus Hupagurus, of which 80 species are contained in our collec-
tion, have received much attention from Mr. Benedict, and a complete
report upon the group is now in course of preparation. Explorations
during the past few years, especially by the steamer Albatross in the
North Pacific Ocean, have added 37 new species to this genus, and pre-
liminary descriptions of these by Mr. Benedict have recently appeared
in the Proceedings. He has also submitted for publication a paper
upon the Corystoid crabs of the genera Telmessus and Hrimacrus, illus-
trated with three plates, and has reported upon a collection of crusta-

ceans obtained in the vicinity of Kingston, Jamaica, by Dr. T. H. Mor-
gan. The latter report was printed in one of the Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity circulars, and the specimens have been deposited in the National
Museum.

Catalogues of the Periceridxe and Maiide, families of maioid erabs,
as represented in our collection, have been completed by Miss Rathbun,
and she is at present at work upon the family Inachidze. She has also
prepared a list of the crustaceans obtained on the coast of Texas by
Prof. B. W. Evermann, during a recent fishing investigation, for pub-
lication in the Bulletin of the Fish Commission. Large numbers of
crustaceans belonging to other families than the above, principally the
result of Fish Commission explorations, but some derived from other
sources, have been identified and will be made the subject of report at
a future time.

The department is indebted to Union College, Schenectady, N. Y.,
the Buffalo Society of Natural History, and Mr. F. A. Stearns, of Detroit,
for the loan of specimens of crustaceans which were desired for exam-
ination and comparison in connection with the studies above referred
to; and also to Mr. J. E. Ives, of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural
Sciences, for assistance in comparing specimens sent from Washington
with the collections of that society. Prof. S. I. Smith, of Yale Univer-
sity, has returned to this Museum for study, the maioid crabs, the
Paguridie and Porcellanidie belonging to the earlier collections of the
Fish Commission, and some Brazilian crustaceans collected by the cura-
tor. Mr. ©. 8. Dolley has also returned the crustaceans obtained by
the steamer Albatross in the Bahama region, and sent to him for exain-
ination a few years ago.

Prot. A. E. Verrill and Miss K. J. Bush have continued enn studies
upon the Fish Commission collections, the property of the National Mu-
seum, now deposited under Prof. Verrill’s charge at the Peabody Mu-
seu of Yale University. Prof. Walter Faxon, of the Museum of Com-
parative Zoology at Harvard College, has reported upon the crayfishes
received in recent accessions, including a new species obtained in Mexico
by Prot. A. Dugés; and the specimens of Oniscidee have been sent for
examination to Profs. O. F. Cook and H. R. Jaquay, of Syracuse Univer-
sity, Syracuse, N. Y., who are proposing to monograph that family.
Prof. Edwin Linton, of Washington and Jefferson College, has described
a number of bird entozoa collected by Mr. P. L. Jouy, at Guaymas, Mex-
ico, and by himself at the Yellowstone National Park, and a paper upon
the subject has been published.

Although no regular fishery investigations were undertaken by the
U.S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross during the past year, yet inci-
dental dredgings were made during a cruise to Bering Sea with the
United States Seal Commissioners, in the summer of 1891, and during
the hydrographic survey for a cable route between California and the
Hawaiian Islands the following winter. Many interesting and several

new forms of deep-sea invertebrates were obtained in the course of both
of these expeditions, and shore collecting was also carried on at Hono-
lulu. The investigations of the steamer Fish Hawk and the schooner
Grampus on the Atlantic coast have been limited to the shallow and
surface waters, and while the natural history collections obtained by
them are not extensive, they will eventually add some material of
importance to this department.

Ten sets of duplicate marine invertebrates, belonging to series No.
IV, the composition of which has been described in previous reports,
have been distributed to educational institutions, as follows: Biolog-
ical School, Avon-by-the-sea, N. J.; Wells College, Aurora, N. Y.;
Trinity University, Durham, N. C.; Fort Worth University, Fort Worth,
Tex.; State Normal School, Mankato, Minn.; Lowa State Normal
School, Cedar Falls, Iowa; State Normal School, Whitewater, Wis.;
Mansfield Memorial Museum, Mansfield, Ohio; Leland Stanford Junior
University, Menlo Park, Cal.; Pennsylvania State Normal School, Mil-
lersville, Pa.

The following special collections have also been supplied, namely:
To the Australian Museum, Sydney, New South Wales, 73 species of
echinoderms; tothe University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, 73 species of
echinoderms and celenterates; to Tulane University, New Orleans, La.,
15 species of corals, 27 species of echinoderms, and 23 species of erusta-
ceans; tothe Royal Zodlogical Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark, a large
series of radiates and crustaceans; to the National Deaf-Mute College,
Kendall Green, Washington, D. ©., 57 species of corals, echinoderms,
hydroids, and sponges. A number of other institutions and of individ-
uals have likewise been furnished with a few species each, generally
for purposes of special study or to supply deficiencies in their collec-
tions.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY
IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By FrREDERIC A. LUCAS, Assistant Curator.

The general work of the year has been, as heretofore, mainly in the
preparation and arrangement of osteological material, but much has
been accomplished for the department of vertebrate fossils, the work
of that department being, so far as the Museum is concerned, carried
on by the Department of Comparative Anatomy.

The most important accession of the year was the skeleton of a young
sperm whale, obtained through the courtesy of the Life-Saving Service,
from the station at Green Run Inlet, Capt. J. J. Dunton, keeper. Many
fishes have been received from the U.S. Fish Commission in connec-
tion with their work for the World’s Columbian Exposition, among
them a fine tarpon and a specimen of the opah, Lampris luna, the
latter having a special value as being the first example taken near our
coast. From the Fish Commission also came an adult bastard logger-
head turtle, Colpochelys kempi, one of the special desiderata in this
department. A second skeleton of the rare fork-tailed gull, Creagrus
Jurcatus, together with other desirable skeletons of birds, was procured
by Mr. C. H. Townsend, of the Fish Commission steamer Albatross.

In addition to the regular routine work a new catalogue of verte-
brate fossils has been commenced, and the greater part of the material
in that department has been recatalogued, a task that has entailed
much comparison of specimens with published figures, reference to
other catalogues, and some necessary identifications.

This has taken a great deal of the time of the assistant curator, as,
owing to the smallness of the force, nearly all the work, even to its
simplest details, has devolved upon him. Twenty lots of recent and
fossil bones have been reported on, and work has been continued on
the synoptic exhibition series of invertebrates, both in the preparation
of specimens and of labels. Comparatively few additions have been
made to the exhibition series, as the work of the preparators has been

181
182 “REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

mainly devoted to material for the study series, and these additions
have been chiefly skeletons of fishes, that class being at present rather
poorly represented. It may be said, however, that a number of speci-
mens were prepared for mounting, which, owing to the pressure of
other work, could not be finished. A small number of Auzoux models,
illustrating certain details of digestion and circulation, have been pur-
chased for the exhibition series, as well as some for use in connection
with the series of invertebrates.

The details of the work of the preparators are given in the report of
the osteological preparator,* and it speaks well for the skill and indus-
try of the assistants that so much has been accomplished in spite of
the many unavoidable interruptions.

The ever-increasing care of the collections has prevented any special
researches, although the assistant curator has devoted a little time to
the study of the osteology of the Steganopodes, a group of birds unusu-
ally well represented in the Museum. Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, to whom
material has been loaned, has continued his work on the osteology of
North American birds. Material has been furnished to Prof. Cope, for
his work on North American reptiles, and to the Bering Sea Commis-
sion in connection with their inquiries concerning the fur seal.

PRESENT CONDITION OF THE COLLECTION.

The present state of the collection is good, but if time admitted and
space were available, a great deal of work might be most profitably
done in labeling and arranging the study series.

The exhibition series is in good shape, but some changes are needed
in a few of the purchased specimens, and some of the labels should be
replaced by others more descriptive in their character.

The number of specimens on exhibition at the end of the year was
as follows:

of Vertebrate Fossils and the temporary withdrawal of a few others.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FOSSIL PLANTS
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By LEsTER F. WarD, Honorary Curator.

The work of the year has been in general a continuation of that out-
lined in the report for last year, the object in mind being the arrange-
ment of the specimens in such a manner as to facilitate their consultation
and study. The work of rearranging and labeling the Carboniferous
specimens was continued to some extent, but the Museum assistant,
Mr. Theo. Holm, has spent the larger part of his time in caring for the
herbarium. Many specimens have been mounted and added to the
collection, and it has in other ways been made of greater assistance in
the study of fossil plants.

During the year there have been added to the collection more exten-
sive and valuable accessions than ever before in the history of the de-
partment of fossil plants. The first of these is the immense collection
of Potomac plants turned over by the U.S. Geological Survey through
Prof. William M. Fontaine, of the University of Virginia. This collec-
tion, filling thirty-one large boxes, and representing several thousand
specimens, embraces the entire series of types and duplicates used by
Prof. Fontaine in the preparation of his elaborate Potomac or Younger
Mesozoic Flera, which forms Volume xv of the Monographs of the
U.S. Geological Survey. This flora is a very remarkable and interest-
ing one. It embraces about 365 species, of which number 75 are dico-
tyledons of peculiar and archaic types, representing perhaps the oldest
dicotyledonous flora known in the world.

Atthe same time the U.S. Geological Survey, through Prof. Fon-
taine, turned over the specimens representing the older Mesozoic flora,
which had been used by Prof. Fontaine in the preparation of Mono-
graph VI, entitled ‘‘ Contributions to the Knowledge of the Older Meso-
zoic Flora of Virginia.” This collection was contained in nine boxes,
and represented several hundred specimens. It is an exceedingly val-
nable collection, not only because it contains most of the types de-
scribed in the above work, but because it embraces many particularly
fine if not unique specimens.

185
So) REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

No gift of greater importance to the department of fossil plants has
ever been made than that by Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa., under
the terms of which his great collection of fossil plants is to be perma-
nently deposited in the National Museum. The value of this collec:
tion, one of world-wide reputation, is far greater than that of the entire
amount of the collections in the department prior to the date of its
gift. The task of procuring fossil plants from the older formations for
use in paleontological and biological research has been prosecuted for
nearly twenty years by its donor, whose liberal means and scientific
and practical mining knowledge, as well as his favorable location in the
heart of the northern anthracite coal field, have enabled him to bring
together an invaluable body of material, of which Prof. Lesquereux
remarked in one of his last publications: * “ Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pitts-
ton, has procured from almost all the localities where coal is worked in
the United States an immense amount of specimens, far beyond any
seen, even in the largest museums of Europe.” Since the above quota-
tion was written Mr. Lacoe has continued his work, having several col-
lectors in his employ in various States and the Acadian provinces, a
portion of the material collected having been examined by Prof. Les-
quereux. Besides gathering this material in the field, he has also pur-
chased a number of private collections containing many type speci-
mens, So that it is perhaps safe to say that nearly one-half of the types
of the American Carboniferous flora now lie within the Lacoe collee-
tion. In fact, there are few outstanding American types except those
resting in several State geological museums. But even the deficiency
in the balance of originals has largely been compensated for by the
collection of duplicates from the type localities, and these, like all other
collections made prior to 1889, were examined and labeled by the orig-
inal author of nine-tenths of the Paleozoic species described from the
United States, Leo Lesquereux. How prominent a part this material
has taken in both the biological and economie applications may be
recognized at a glance in the three volumes (especially the third) of
the “Coal Flora,” published with an atlas by the second geological
survey of Pennsylvania in 1878-1884, Report P. It is sufficient to add
in this place that within this collection the data for working out the
~ geological and geographical distribution of the Carboniferous plant
species, as far as they can be worked out at the present stage of explo-
ration, is probably more ample than that of all other American collec-
tions combined.

It will at once be seen that the accession of this invaluable wealth
of material will necessarily make this institution, as the repository of
the types or authentic specimens of nearly all the American Paleozoic
species, the reference center for all extensive work on the Paleozoic
flora in this country in future, as well as the custodian of valuable geo-
logical correlation data. But the proper installation in this Museum

of so great a collection, numbering about 100,000 specimens, is a matter
involving much embarrassment in the way of space and study facili-
ties, it being agreed in the terms of the gift that this collection, to be
kept entire and known as the “ Lacoe Coilection,” shall, together with
all future additions, either by exchange or gift of the donor, be kept in
order and made accessible to scientists and students without distine-
tion, under such proper rules and restrictions as may be necessary for
the preservation from loss or injury of the specimens.

As constituted at present the collection consists of: (1) Types and
study specimens; (2) Fine exhibition slabs and specimens; (3) Boxes
containing (a) unstudied and (b) duplicate material. The area required
by the first class, making no allowance either for the future accessions
or for new material to be found in the boxes not yet examined, amounts
to over 1,000 drawers of the size in ordinary use in the Museum. The
exhibition material will occupy about 2,100 square feet. Of the bal-
ance of the collection, about 80 boxes, a portion only will require
drawer space, while the remainder may be labeled and made in some
way accessible as exchange material.

Arrangements were made whereby, in January and February of this
year, Mr. David White, assistant paleontologist in the U.S. Geological
Survey, spent four weeks in Pittston engaged in work preliminary to
the transfer of the collection. Among the boxes brought back was a
small portion of the type and study exhibition material. Two cases of
- exhibition material have been arranged and labeled by Mr. White, and
they now stand in the central rotunda.

The remainder of the cases brought from Pittston include a large
quantity of material more or less thoroughly studied by Prof. Lesque
reux and supposed to represent species either new to science or not
before found in this country. Most of these unpublished specimens
examined by Prof. Lesquereux are accompanied by MSs. in various
stages of completion, or notes with some illustrations. All this new
matter, together with the plants in question, has been placed by Mr.
Lacoe in the hands of Mr. White, who will assist him in revising, veri-
fying, and completing the posthumous work for publication. Mueh
time and labor will be necessary in the preparation of the Ms. and
additional drawings for the publication, which should appear as soon
as possible, before this portion of the collection is ready for enrollment
on the Museum register. Owing largely to failing health during the
last years of Prof. Lesquereux’s scientific labors a considerable time
wili need to be spent in going through the collection in a scrutinous
review. This task, along with the identification of a large quantity of
lew material, probably requiring five or six months, it is the donor’s
desire to have accomplished before the entire collection is removed
and enrolled on the Museum books. It can probably be best done in
Pittston, where Mr. Lacoe will be at hand to furnish any needed geo-
graphical or stratigraphieal information.
188 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

In the removal of so enormous a collection it will perhaps be better
to transfer it by orders or groups as fast as the necessary scrutiny and
completion of labels and enrollment are finished. It is therefore de-
sirable that, whenever the work is renewed, cases may be ready for its
reception as fast as the material arrives in Washington.

The separation of the duplicate specimens for exchange will be simul-
taneous with the review and registry of the specimens. ‘These should
be labeled and fully listed before placing them in an accessible storage.
Several exchanges have already been engaged with American and
European paleontologists, the specimens for which may be selected
while the collection is being packed.

In acquiring the Lacoe collection the Museum not only receives a most
important paleontological accession, but it becomes the custodian of a
large mass of unelaborated correlative material, which, if rightly used,
will prove of great value and aid to scientific and economic geology; and
this rich possession affords just ground for national scientific pride,
while the liberal public spirit with which it was given is worthy of
imitation by all patrons of science.

My investigations of the local exposures of the Potomac formation,
as mentioned in my last report, were continued as opportunity afforded
throughout the year. In September and October I made, in company
with several members of the U. 8S. Geological Survey, an extended
field trip to Texas and Arkansas with a view of determining the prob-
able relation of the Trinity formation of those States with the Potomac
formation. In April I also made another field trip, this time studying
the Lower Cretaceous formations of Alabama, securing a valuable col-
lection of fossil plants. Later,in May and June, I made an extensive
overland journey from the Potomac to the Raritan in New Jersey for
the purpose of studying the relation of the Potomac of Virginia and
Maryland and the so-called “‘Amboy clays” of New Jersey. The results
were in every way sasisfactory and will be published by the U. 8.
Geological Survey.

Mr. Theo. Holm was the Museum assistant for the entire year. His
time was mainly spent in work on the herbarium, with a view to making
it of the greatest possible value in the study of fossil plants. He
mounted and placed in the cases several hundred sheets of plants,
largely native trees and shrubs, and at the close of the year was
engaged upon the duplicate collection in selecting such as it seemed
desirable to mount for the study series. He had also begun the deter-
mination of a collection of plants from Morocco, obtained during 1889
by Mr. Talcott Williams, of Philadelphia.

Prof. F. H. Knowlton continued during the year his study of the
Laramie flora, and had well under way at the close a revision of the
plants of this group, based on the original Lesquereux type specimens
in the National Museum and large recent collections from Colorado.
When this work is completed, it is hoped that the Laramie flora will be
DEPARTMENT OF FOSSIL PLANTS. 189

placed on a basis that will admit of its extensive geological use. Prof.
Knowlton also identified and revised, by the aid of Museum material,
a considerable collection of plants from the Bozeman (Montana) coal
field and prepared a report which will soon be printed. It enumerates
forty-four species, five of which are described as new to science.

The accessions of Upper Paleozoic material, with the exception of the
fossil woods, have been examined by Mr. David White, who has reported
on all minor transmittals. In connection with his regular survey work
Mr. White has also spent a considerable time on the collections sent by
Dr. J. H. Britts from the Power coal measures of Missouri, and the first
collection forwarded by L. Graff from Van Buren, Ark., the speci-
mens being studied by genera, together with those of the Carboniferous
plant collections of the U.S. Geological Survey now in his hands. The
work on the Britts collections, which include a number of new or little
known forms, will probably be completed by the 1st of January. His
study and other work on the Lacoe collection is mentioned in the part
of this report relating to that particular collection.

Mr. Charles S. Prosser was in the field from July 1 to August 26,
engaged in studying the Middle and Upper Devonian formations of
Monroe, Pike, and Wayne Counties, Pa., with special reference to the
flora and fauna. The collection made is of great importance in deter-
mining doubtful horizons and correcting previous errors. His time in
the office was largely spent on the compendium of paleobotany which
has been in preparation for some years in this office.

An entirely new arrangement of the exhibition series of fossil plants
was begun. Heretofore the plants had been arranged systematically,
with a view to illustrating, as far as the material admitted, the origin
and development of plant life, but it had been found that plants widely
separated geologically were brought side by side, and it was thought
best to abolish the botanical and substitute for it the geological ar-
rangement. Each plan of arrangement has its advantages, but as all
the other paleontological collections were arranged geologically it
seemed as well to have the plants conform. The system of placing
each specimen on an ebonized block was also abandoned as unsatisfae-
tory.

As the exhibition series is confined to a single row of table eases in
the fossil court, nothing like a complete series can be shown, but
beginning with the lowest plant-bearing rocks, enough specimens were
placed on exhibition to give a fairly good idea of the predominant
vegetation of each period. The specimens illustrating the Devonian,
a part of the Carboniferous, and all of the Potomac were put in the
cases. The last-named flora, that of the Potomac, is very fully exhib-
ited on account of its peculiar types of vegetation. The other forma-
tions will be as fully illustrated as the space will admit.

The flora of the Dakota Group, by the late Prof. Leo Lesquereux,
as announced in the last annual report, was printed during the year,
190 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

It forms Monograph xvi of the U.S. Geological Survey. The larger
part of the type specimens upon which it is based is now the property
of the Museum. Of these not now here, many are in the lately donated
collection of Mr. R. D. Lacoe and will be brought here shortly. A few
of the types are in the Museum of the University of Kansas, but by
the kindness of the chancellor, Prof. F. H. Snow, duplicates, in some
eases better than the originals, have been donated, so that the Museum
now has probably the most complete collection extant representing this
flora.

Prof. William M. Fontaine, of the University of Virginia, has worked
up a small but very interesting collection of plants from the Kootanie
beds at Great Falls, Mont. Several species and varieties are found
to be new, and the whole collection has been described and discussed
in an illustrated paper which is about to be published in the ‘‘ Proceed-
ines of the National Museum.”

Several exceptionally fine specimens of a gigantic fossil alga (Nema-
tophyton crassum), obtained by Mr. Charles 8S. Prosser, at Skunnemunk
Mountain, near Monroe, Orange County, N. Y., have been made the
basis of a special study by Prof. D. P. Penhallow, of McGill University,
Montreal, Canada. His paper, illustrated by a number of photomicro-
eraphs, is also about to be published in the ‘ Proceedings of the
National Museum.”

In Lesquereux’s Tertiary Flora (p. 70, Pl. Lx111, Figs. 1, 1d) there
was described and figured a peculiar silicified fossil plant from near
Golden, Colo., under the name of Zamiostrobus mirabilis. This speci-
men, No. 100 of the catalogue of fossil plants in the National Museum,
was, by request, loaned to H. Graf zu Solms-Laubach, professor of bot-
any in the University of Strasburg, Germany, who was making a
special study of all the fossil eyeadean stems and fruits of the world.
He had several large thin sections cut from the specimen and gave it a
thorough microscopical study, which resulted in his changing the name
to Cycadeoidea pamiostrobus. The specimen has been returned with
several microscopical preparations.

In addition to the Lacoe collection, about 25,000 specimens have been
added to the collection of the department during the year, making a
total increase of about 125,000 specimens.

The last catalogue entry for June, 1891, is 3,503, and for June, 1892, is 3,598, an
increase of 95 entries.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF PALEOZOIC INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS
IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892,

By C. D. Wawcort, Honorary Curator.

The year’s work, in its bearings upon the collections, has been very
much the same as for 189091, when I reported that it was indirect
rather than direct, owing to the necessity for my completing certain
work for the U.S. Geological Survey. Large quantities of material
have been received from the collectors of the Survey, much of which
has been placed in storage awaiting an opportunity to have it elaborated
and transferred to the Museum. During the month of July, 1891, the
collection of Cambrian and Ordovician fossils, belonging to the exhibi-
tion series, was completed and placed on exhibition and a large number
of labels written for it. And at various times during the year addi-
tions of individual specimens were made to the exhibition series.

In the laboratory considerable time was given to painting the record
numbers on the specimens belonging to the accessions of previous
years that had not been fully recorded, and in the preparation for study
of a large amount of material obtained by the collectors of -the Geo-
logical Survey. Owing to the crowded condition of the laboratory and
the want of exhibition space, more attention was given to the prepara-
tion of material for future study and exhibition than to the immediate
incorporating of it into the exhibition series.

Mr. Oscar Hinrichs, jr., was employed during the year in his various
duties connected with the laboratory and the exhibition series—enter-
ing, numbering, and labeling the accessions, writing cards for the exhi-
bition specimens, ete.

During the week of the meeting of the International Congress of
Geologists (in August) many of the leading paleontologists and geol-
ogists of Europe visited and examined the collections of fossils in the
Museum. They commented most favorably on the Museum exhibition
and also on the large amount of fine material in the various labora-
tories.

Reference to the papers published by me during the year is made in
the Bibliography (Section ry).

During the year 29 accessions were received. A list of them is here
given.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MESOZOIC INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS
IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By C. A. Wuire, Honorary Curator.

During the past year, as in preceding years, the work of this divi-
sion has been done wholly by members of the U. 8S. Geological Survey ;
and yet the usual routine, and much of the special work pertaining to
it, has been fully attended to.

The fossil collections have continued to increase during the year, the
most important accession having been received from the U.S. Geolog-
ical Survey. This accession (No. 25725) embraces 10,566 specimens
and includes some of the most important paleontological material which
has been studied by members of the Survey. A large part of this
accession is now placed in the exhibition series, and more of it will be
similarly placed as soon as time for the work can be spared.

The entries in the Museum catalogue for the year range from 21752
to 22170.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BOTANY
IN THE U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By Dr. GEORGE VASEY, Honorary Curator.

The report now presented constitutes my fourth annual report relat-
ing to the National Herbarium.

The growth of the herbarium has been steady, although the per cent.
of increase has not equaled that of last year. The herbarium has
practically been rearranged during the past year. New genus-covers
and genus-labels have been substituted for the old ones. The labels
are printed either in black or red. The black label implies that the
genus belongs to North America north of Mexico; the red label
implies that the genus is foreign. These are divided into two groups:
Mexican and South American, and Old World. Each is placed in a
separate genus-cover. The native and foreign genera are not other-
wise separated. The species under each genus, asa rule, are arranged
alphabetically; in some American genera of which there are recent
monographs, the species are arranged systematically, with an alpha
betie index to the species. The Phanerogams have been arranged
according to Durand’s Index.

The Ferns are arranged by genera according to Hooker’s Species
Filicum. In the case of the Mosses, Liverworts, and Lichens the gen-
era are arranged alphabetically.

The Fungi are represented by 16,397 specimens and contain 6,424
species. They are now kept in the Division of Vegetable Pathology,
Department of Agriculture.

The Mosses and Liverworts have all been remounted during the
past two years. These are kept in tight pockets. Six of these pockets
belonging to one species are glued upon a single sheet of the standard
size of mounting paper and filed away, as ordinary herbarium speci-
mens. The number of pockets of Mosses in the herbarium at the pres-
sent time is 8,154, and of Liverworts 1,300.

The mounted specimens are almost free from all kinds of herbarium
pests. Our duplicate collections, however, were threatened with
destruction by what the entomologist of the Department of Agriculture
considered a new genus of insects, probably introduced with specimens

197
198 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

sent from the dry regions of western Mexico. The pest is a small
geometrid larva about 8™" long. In order to get rid of this larva, a
wooden box with close-fitting top was prepared, of the following dimen-
sions: 4 feet long by 20 inches wide and 2 feet deep. This box was
then filled with bundles of plants, a cup holding about half a gill of
bisulphide of carbon was placed with them, covered, and allowed to
remain for twenty-four hours or more. This operation was repeated
until all the duplicates had been poisoned. Our large collections are
treated in this manner when they first arrive.

During the year a card catalogue of all the botanical works in the
libraries to which this department has access, has been begun. Already
the library of the Department of Agriculture has been catalogued, and
many of the books in the Library of Congress and the library of the
Smithsonian Institution.

ACCESSIONS.

The accessions received during the year ending June 30, 1892, num-
ber 512 (catalogue Nos. 991 to 1503), of which 41 were received through

REPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892,

By F. W. Ciarkr, Honorary Curator.

Probably no year has been more productive of good results in the
department of minerals than the one now ended. A large part of the
systematic exhibition series has been remounted on ebonized blocks,
replacing the former white paper trays; and soon the entire series will
be so displayed. Several cases of this series have been supplied with
printed specimen labels, and the work of labeling is still in progress.

A large double case has been substituted for the small single gem-
case, so that now the collection of gems and semi-precious stones, num-
bering 2,215 specimens, is contained in two large double mahogany
cases. Of this collection 1,717 specimens are on exhibition.

Many specimens belonging to the reserve and duplicate series had
accumulated in drawers stacked up in the mineral laboratory. The
reserve specimens have been transferred to the cases in the exhibition
hall, and the duplicates have been disposed of by restocking the cases
containing the classified duplicates, and by packing and sending the
remainder to storage; of these last there were 7,823 specimens. The
systematic duplicate series has been thoroughly overhauled and reclas-
sified, and it has been much improved by rejecting inferior specimens
and adding new and better material. This series is now used largely
for improving the collection by means of exchanges with other museums
and private collectors. During the year exchanges of 371 specimens
of minerals have been made with 15 different parties and 61 specimens
have been sent out as gifts, making a total disbursement of 432 speci-
mens.

Considerable time has been consumed in selecting and preparing the
mineral and gem series to be exhibited at the World’s Columbian Expo-
sition in Chicago. The scheme for this exhibit is subjoined:

1. A series of crystallized minerals to illustrate the erystal form of
minerals. (a) Crystals not attached; (b) distinetive crystals on matrix;
(c) erystal groups.

2. A series illustrative of the twinning of erystals.

3. A series to illustrate the irregularities of crystals.

4, A series of crystalline aggregates.
201
202 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

5. A series of mineral pseudomorphs.

6. A series to illustrate cleavage and fracture.

7. A series to illustrate diaphaneity, color and lustre.
8. A series of gems and ornamental stones.

ACCESSIONS.

Among the most important accessions, mention may be made of the
following:

Twenty-tive boxes of minerals from Pennsylvania, the gift of Joseph Willcox, of
Philadelphia. (Ace. 24802.)

A suite of 11 specimens of minerals from Branchville, Conn.; 1 specimen from
Salisbury, Conn., and 1 specimen from Brewsters, N. Y., the gift of Prof. S. L. Penfield,
of Yale University. (Ace. 25202.)

Four specimens of ornamental stones and 1 specimen of churchite, the gift of
Mr. Clarence 8S. Bement, of Philadelphia. (Acc. 25395.)

A crystal of spangolite from Tombstone, Ariz., the gift of Prof. S. L. Penfield, of
Yale University. (Acc. 25421.)

Two cut specimens of transparent spessartite from Amelia C. H., Va., the gift of
Mr. Ira R. Allen, of Fair Haven, Vt. (Acc. 25739.)

Three specimens of native gold from the Potomac Mine, Montgomery Co., Md.,
deposited by Mr. A. B. Russ, of Washington, D.C. (Ace. 24805.)

Twenty-nine specimens of ornamental stones from various localities, purchased
of Mr. W. J. Knowlton, of Boston, for the World’s Columbian Exposition. (Ace.
24545.)

Thirty-two specimens. of minerals from various localities, nine of them for the
World’s Columbian Exposition, purchased of H. A. Ward, of Rochester. (Acc.
24778 and 24779.)

Eleven gems from Maine and New Hampshire, bought of Mr. T. F. Lamb, of Port-
land, for the World’s Columbian Exposition. (Ace. 24927.)

Nineteen specimens of minerals from various localities purchased of Messrs.
English & Co., New York City, for the World’s Columbian Exposition. (Ace.
24849. )

In addition to the foregoing, several lots of minerals have been
received from the U.S. Geological Survey.

The condition of the collection, with the exception of the study
series, which is only partly classified, is very satisfactory. The sys-
tematic exhibition series of minerals is displayed in twenty-two mahog-
any and plate-glass double slope-top cases, arranged in rows in the
exhibition hall. The series is arranged mainly according to Dana’s
system, and each specimen is mounted on an ebonized wooden block,
14 inches thick, on the beveled front of which is fastened a gray card-
board label, clearly printed, giving the name of the species, its variety,
the locality of the specimen, the name of its donor or collector, and its
catalogue number.

When the installation has been completed, the series will be provided
‘with species labels, indicating the chemical composition of each species,
its crystallographic form, hardness, specific gravity, its varieties with
their characteristics, and any additional information which may be of
publie interest.
DEPARTMENT OF MINERALS. 203

The ornamental stone collection is displayed in single specimens and
in groups, on black and white plush pads, each specimen or group
having a card-board label beneath it.

The meteorite collection consists at present of an exhibition series
only, no attempt having yet been made to separate from it a study or
a duplicate series, though many exchanges have been made by which
the collection has been largely built up. It is installed in mahogany
wall-cases with plate-glass fronts, each specimen occupying a black
tray with a beveled front, the bottom of which is lined with dark red
billiard cloth. The labels are of French gray card-board, like those of
the systematic mineral series, and give similar information, the date of
the fall or find being added when known.

REPORT ON- THE DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By GEORGE P. MERRILL, Curator.

As during the previous year, a considerable proportion of our time
has been occupied in the arrangement of the exhibition series. This
work was interrupted during the months of November, December, and
January by the laying of the new pavements in the south-west court
and west-south range. ‘This necessitated moving all the floor-cases in
both halls, and, incidentally, nearly every specimen, since specimens and
labels were as a rule displaced by the jar caused by moving the cases,
or else were so covered with dust as to necessitate thorough cleansing.
Aside from the mere delay here involved, fully two months were actu-
ally lost,so far as advance of work was concerned, in restoring the col-
lections to their original conditions.

A very important work of the year has been the preparation of some
two hundred sets of duplicates for gratuitous distribution. In addition
to the immense quantity of duplicate matter received from the Centennial
Exposition at Philadelphia in 1876, there has since accumulated much
other valuable material, and the long-deferred time seemed to have
actually arrived when the department could begin to respond to its
many applications. In order, however, that the collections might be
to some extent systematic, several collecting trips were undertaken
during the late summer and fall. Mr, W. H. Newhall was thus engaged
in New Jersey and Virginia in August and September, and the curator
made brief trips into New Jersey, Maine, and Massachusetts on similar
errands. The collections thus obtained are noted under the head of

-accessions. The following list shows the character of the material put

into these series:

DEPARTMENT OF GEOLOGY. 209

The work of preparing an exhibit for the World’s Columbian Expo-
sition was entered upon late in September. It was decided that the
department should, so far as the limited appropriations permitted,
make an exhibit illustrative of the various phenomena grouped under
the heads of I, Vulcanology; Il, Glaciers and Glaciation, and III,
Caves and Cave Deposits.

The general character of the exhibit, as planned, may be understood
by reference to the outline given below:

and bowlders; scratched bowlders from till.

Economy of glaciers: View of glaciated landscapes, showing how denudation
has rendered accessible deeply buried materials; leda clays and their utiliza-
tion; drift bowlders for building material.

Destructive effects: Fields covered by bowlders; forests destroyed. [Shown by
illustrations only. ]

III. Caves and Cave Deposits.

Theoretical sketch showing method of formation by solvent action of water,

Actual plans and sections of caves.

210 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

The work of obtaining materials illustrative of glacial action in the
eastern United States was placed in the hands of Prof. W.O. Crosby.
As the work is still in progress at time of writing, nothing more need
now be said regarding it.

For the purpose of collecting materials for this exhibit the curator
left Washington October 27 for Arizona and New Mexico, returning
December 16. A large amount of voleanic and cave material was col-
lected during this time, which will be noted under the head of acces-
sions. May 17 the curator again left on a similar errand, visiting
‘aves in Virginia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Indiana and Missouri. The
material obtained during this trip was exceptionally good, as well as
varied in character, but owing to the fact that his absence was pro-
longed beyond the end of the fiscal year, it cannot here be reported on
in detail.

NOTES UPON THE MORE IMPORTANT ACCESSIONS RECEIVED DURING
THE YEAR.

One hundred and sixteen regular and 135 temporary accessions were
received during the year, the regular accessions comprising upwards ot
4,000 specimens. The more important of these are mentioned below.

CHARACTER OF ROUTINE WORK.

The character of the routine work has varied but little from that of
preceding years. The work of preparing the duplicate series neces-
sitated the overhauling and breaking up of many of the large ore piles
that have hitherto cumbered the west front; 36 boxes were also with-
drawn from storage, and their contents utilized. In process of this
work some 15,057 specimens of rocks and ores were broken up, trimmed,
labeled and wrapped ready for packing. The final work of packing
these 200 sets, though scarcely completed at the end of the fiscal year,
was so nearly done as to be properly comprehended in this report.

A large amount of time was devoted to the installation of the economic
series in the southwest court and which may now for the first time
claim to be in a condition approximately satisfactory.

Duplicates have been sent out, mainly in the way of exchanges, as
follows:

July 9, 1891, to James Allen, 3 specimens of rocks.

July 25, 1891, to A. T. Odeneal, 1 specimen of rock.

August 31, 1891, to M. Mali, Belgian consul, 17 specimens of coal.

September 3, 1891, to R. N. Worth, 152 specimens of ores.

September 7, 1891, to C. E. Vawter, 3 boxes (150 pounds).

September 9, 1891, to George H. Barton, 5 boxes (1,235 pounds).

September 9, 1891, to E. E. Howell, 183 specimens of rocks.

September 15, 1891, to E. E, Howell, 300 pounds of ores and 3 specimens of slab
marbles,

April 27, 1892, to S. Ward Loper, 1 specimen of onyx.

May 17, 1892, to KE. KE. Howell, 6 specimens of rocks and ores.

Total, 4,385 pounds and 1,398 specimens of rocks, ete.

This list does not include the 200 boxes comprising 17,924 specimens
above referred to.

The work of identifying materials sent in by those not connected with
the Museum continues, as heretofore, to consume its full share of time.
The following list of special reports will serve to give some idea of the
extent of this practice. As stated previously, the department can not
make assays or analyses on such occasions, but whenever possible with-
out too great an outlay of time, the mineralogical nature of the mate-
rial has been ascertained and the applicant referred elsewhere for infor-
mation not obtainable here. These reports were made as follows:

SPECIAL RESEARCHES.

Little time has been at our command for special research. The De-
partment has no chemist, and the entire determinative work falls upon
the curator, who even makes a large proportion of his own analyses.

The titles of such papers as have appeared during the year are given
in the Bibliography (SEC. IV).

It will be observed that the figures for the study series are the same
as in my last report. This does not mean that there have in reality
been no additions to this series, but rather that these additions, of
which there are several very important, are not as yet properly installed.
As heretofore, no attempt is made at estimating the number of speci-
mens in the storage sheds, or of duplicate materials.

The need of additional exhibition space is even greater than at the
time of my last report, and it is hoped that before the close of another
year steps may be taken towards the erection of a balcony around the
south-west court which will afford space for the building-stone collec-
tion. The necessity for this change was sufficiently dwelt upon in my
last report.

The regular working force of the department for the year, aside from
the curator, has been as follows: Mr. W. H. Newhall, aid; Miss C.
Hurlburt, copyist; and Mr. J. C. Neale, preparator. Thomas Reese,
laborer, has also served for a large portion of the year. Prof. R. L.
Packard, who has availed himself of the opportunities offered for study
during a considerable portion of the year, has rendered the departinent
on sundry occasions, great service in determinative and analytical work.

JAPANESE WOOD-CUTTING AND WOOD-CUT PRINTING,

Communicated by J. ToKUNO,

Chief of Insetsu-Kioku (Bureau of Engraving and Printing) of the Ministry of Finance,
Tokio, Japan.

Edited and annotated by S. R. KOEHLER,

Curator of the Section of Graphic Arts, U. S. National Museum, Washington, D. C.

Through the kindness of Mr. T. Tokuno, Chief of the Bureau of
Engraving and Printing of the Ministry of Finance, Tokio, Japan, the
U.S. National Museum has receive? as a gift from the Imperial Goy-
ernment of Japan the complete outfit of a Japanese wood-cutting
and wood-cut printing establishment, accompanied by illustrated de-
scriptions of all the tools and materials sent and of the processes
used by Japanese engravers and printers. The original statements
made by Mr. Tokuno were supplemented by answers to questions ad-
dressed to him by me, and the patience and courtesy shown by this
well-informed official can not be too highly appreciated and too warmly
acknowledged. The publication of the information thus elicited will
be welcomed by those who are interested in the art of the wood-cutter
and in the arts of Japan, more especially as Mr. Tokuno’s communica-
tion is, so far as I know, the first authoritative statement on this sub-
ject made by a native of Japan thoroughly qualified for the task. As
the information which follows is scattered through a number of letters
and memoranda, it will not be possible to give it absolutely in the
shape in which it was received, but care will be taken to adhere as
closely as possible to Mr. Tokuno’s own statements. Occasional ob-
securities which still remain must be charged to the necessity of corre-
sponding in English and to the great distance between the correspond-
ents. The illustrations which accompany this paper, so far as they
relate to Japanese wood-cutting and printing, were all made either
from the objects themselves or from drawings by Japanese artists fur-
nished by Mr. Tokuno. Such remarks as suggest themselves upon a
comparison of our own methods, past and present, with those of Japan
will be given as an appendix to Mr. Tokuno’s communication.

The tools and specimens alluded to in the following pages have been
placed on exhibition in the Hall of Graphic Arts, eastern side, alcove
2, in the square case on the floor of the alcove, and in frames 28 to 34.

222 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.
MR. T. TOKUNO’S COMMUNICATION.

THE WOODS USED AND THEIR PREPARATION. Although “tsuge,” a
variety of Buxus Japonica, or ‘adsusa,” Catalpa Kampfert var. Ja-
ponica, are employed, according to the degree of fineness of the written
characters or pictures to be reproduced, the wood most generally used
is “sakura,” a variety of cherry. In all cases, however, the texture
must be very fine and hard.

The wood is first cut into planks, and these are planed until they
are perfectly level and smooth, free froin all traces of the plane, and
show some luster on the surface. Both sides are finished alike, as the
woodcutter utilizes both of them.

Cut planks which are to be printed in black only are usually mounted
between strips nailed to each end. There are several reasons for this.
It prevents the warping of the planks; it gives free access to the air
between them, when a number are stored on top of one another, and
provides the best means of keeping them dry and guarding against
damage by insects; it prevents immediate contact of the blocks, and,
finally, it is sometimes very convenient, as it facilitates the drawing
out of such planks as may be needed from among many stored away
together, the planks being marked or numbered on the sides of the
strips. For color-printing, however, the same plank often has two or
three designs upon it for different tints, and consequently has register-
ing marks on different parts. In that case the end strips would be in
the way, and are, therefore, omitted.

THE TOOLS OF THE ENGRAVER. For engraving, knives and chisels
of the best quality are required. All the tools needed by the engraver
are represented on Plates rv (1-18) and v (19-25), and with the following
explanations their uses will be readily understood:

1. Ruler for cutting straight lines and for fixing the registering
marks on the planks used in color-printing.

2. Brush for removing from the plank the chips thrown out by the
cutting tools.

3. Engraving knife, for cutting out the design. Only one knife,
always of the same pattern and size, is used by the Japanese wood-
cutters, and with this one knife they perform all grades of work, from
the coarsest to the finest, the execution depending entirely on the skill
of the engraver. [See Fig. 1 for a Japanese wood-cutter’s knife, actual
size, seen from both sides. |

4-9. Chisels for removing smaller portions of wood between the lines
of the design. They are used exactly like the engraving knife.

10,11, Chisels for correcting unsatisfactory parts |7. e., removing parts
for “plugging”.

12. Saw for cutting small pieces of wood to be inserted in the plank
where corrections have to be made.

15-16, Chisels for removing larger portions of wood.

17, 18. Semicircular chisels, used for the same purpose as 13-16.

24,25. Wooden mallets for

THE ORIGINALS FURNISHED
TO THE WOOD-CUTTERS, AND
THE METHOD OF TRANSFER-
RING THEM TO THE PLANKS.
Written characters or pict-
ures to be cut on wood are
drawn upon a certain kind of
Japanese paper, “minogami”
or ** gampishi,” and the draw-
ings thus made are pasted
[face downward] upon a pre-
pared plank, by means of
starch paste. The plank is
now ready for the engraver.
This applies to prints in black
only. For color-printing, the
outlines of the design are first
eut and printed in black ink
(Indian ink mixed with a
solution of glue) upon mino-
gami,” and the designer of
the picture then marks the
parts to be colored [on differ-
ent sheets]. These sheets are
then pasted down on the Ne ttaTcioee lioviews:

p’ ‘ks, as before stated, and (From the specimen in the U. §, National Musuem.)
the »ngraving also proceeds as before.

AIM OF JAPANESE WOODCUTTING. The important point to be kept
in view incharacteristic Japanese wood-cutting is to show the direction
of the brush in painting, so as not to destroy the features of an original
picture or of written characters. The direction in which the knife is
moved might be said to be almost identical with the direction of the
brush, and wood-cuts by skillful hands therefore show the exact fea-
tures of the originals, while, at the same time, they have a special ar-
tistic character of their own.

MANNER OF HANDLING THE ENGRAVING TOOLS. The tools, having
been put into good order and well sharpened, are laid on one side of
the engraving table, and upon the latter is placed the plank to be cut.
The wood-cutter, holding his knife in his right hand and pushing the
back of it with the middle finger of the left hand, first cuts around all
the lines of the design, and then removes the wood between them by
means of the chisels, so as to leave the lines in relief. He then, with a
small brush, cleans and washes the plank, and has a proof taken, after
which he makes corrections, if necessary.

Plate Vi shows a wood-cutter at work. <A is the plank; B, a grinding
stone for sharpening the knives and chisels; C is a box containing
engraver’s tools.

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OLD AND MODERN JAPANESE METHODS OF
WOOD-CUTTING, Although the method of cutting on wood differs
slightly at present from the ancient method, the principal points are,
nevertheless, the same. :

All ancient wood-cuts are comparatively deeper than those of the
present day. The shallowness of modern cutting is due, probably, to
the ability to do much finer work.

In the ancient style the outer boundaries of letters or pictures were
cut away deeply before they were properly engraved. At present the
stages are reversed. The latter method takes less labor and time, and
it is probably one of the causes of the shallow cutting at present in
vogue.

Formerly the paper bearing the original design, after it had been
pasted down on the plank, was oiled, so as to make it transparent,
and to enable the wood-cutter to see the design quite distinctly. This
is not necessary now, as it is easy to get paper sufficiently thin and
transparent in itself.

Semicircular chisels are now in use for removing some of the parts
between the lines of the design. There were no such chisels formerly,

somewhat resembling our ordinary roofing slate, but softer and less finely fis-
siled.

No. 20 is a soft, buff-colored argillaceous rock, more like the German razor hone
than anything we use.

No. 21 is a whitish, somewhat decomposed siliceous rock, rather coarse for a whet-
stone, giving, when breathed upon, a distinct clayey odor, indicating the presence of
free argillaceous matter. ;

and hence much more time and labor was spent on this part of the
work than at present.

PAPERS USED FOR PRINTING, AND THEIR TREATMENT. ‘The papers
used, whatever their quality, should be sized with a thin animal size.
Among the prints sent to the U.S. National Museum are impressions
on three different kinds of paper:—a special Japanese paper, made at
the Insetsu-Kioku paper mills [known in America as Imperial Japanese
paper], a Chinese paper, and ** masa” paper.

The sheets are moistened with water before the printing begins, the
degree of moisture differing according to the quality of the paper,
the proper degree being determined by the judgment of the printer.
‘‘Masa” paper, for instance, on which the progressive proofs of one of
the pictures (“* Yinaka genji”) sent to the U.S. National Museum are
printed, should be very shghtly moistened by means of a brush. Ex-
periment has shown the amount of moisture in this case to be 13.86
per cent. A single wet sheet is put between every three or four dry
sheets, until a suitable layer is formed, which is pressed between two
wooden press-boards. When all the sheets have the proper degree of
moisture they are ready for printing.

As the printing on this moist paper is done with water colors, it can
be well done only by an experienced printer. The following points are
to be noted: A. The paper should rather be under than overmoistened.
If it is overmoistened the water colors will spread beyond their limits’
If the paper dries during the progress of the work, wet sheets are
put between the sheets to be printed, and the heap is allowed to lie
until the proper degree of moisture has been obtained. If the paper is
thick and strong it should be slightly moistened from the back by
means of a brush. 6. Great care must be taken not to put an exces-
Sive quantity of color on the plank. Rice paste serves well to prevent
the water colors from spreading, and it ought to be used for every im-
pression.

The printed sheets, in the interval between two printings, are laid on
top of one another, to the number of many hundred sheets. If the
water colors have been properly applied there is no fear of offsetting
on the backs of the sheets.

A backing sheet is not generally used, but if it is desired to avoid
all traces of the “‘baren” on the back of the printed sheets, a sheet of
thin paper is used for backing.

PRINTING ON SILK.—Silk is occasionally used for printing instead
of paper, and one of the specimens sent to the U.S. National Museum
-ison this material It is usually found necessary to mount the silk on
paper, but some experts can print without this device. The silk on
which one of the impressions of ‘“‘ Nandina domestica” is printed {in
33 colors] was mounted on paper, but only along the edge which was
laid against the registering marks. When the printing was finished
this edge was trimmed off.

PIGMENTS AND VEHICLES USED FOR PRINTING.—Five colors or
pigments only [black, white, red, yellow, blue] are generally used for
- the most characteristic Japanese printing, such as the picture called
“Yinaka genji,”* sent to the U.S. National Museum. They are all
mixed with the necessary quantity of water, when about to be used,
and the various hues, shades, and tints required are obtained by mixing
the proper pigments together. These pigments, of which samples were
sent to the U.S. National Museum, are the following:

a. Black, tstike-zumi,” is generally prepared by macerating Japan-
ese ink (a kind of India ink) in water for a few days, until the glue con-
tained in it is dissolved, and the ink is sufficiently softened. It is then
ground by means of pestle and mortar. As, however, the “tsike-
zumi” so made is very liable to deterioration, a sample of a lampblack
obtained from a Japanese ink macerated in water so as to remove the
glue, was sent to the U.S. National Museum. Consequently when this
lampblack is to be used, and after it has been mixed with water, glue
solution, or rice paste (according to the judgment of the printer) will
have to be added. If glue solution is used it should be mixed with
the lampblack in a basin, but if rice paste is used, that is mixed with
the pigment on the plank itself by means of the brush.

b. White, “‘to-no-tsuchi,” is white lead. It is used either alone, for
prints of flowers, birds, etc., or mixed with other colors, if light tints
or body colors are wanted.

*«<YVinaka genji” is a design in black outlines with color washes. It is printed
on three sheets, intended to be pasted together, each sheet measuring about 9}
inches in breadth by 14 inches in height, printed surface, or the three sheets, when
pasted together, about 29 inches in breadth by 14 inches in height. It represents a
hilly landscape, in the middle ground of which agricultural operations are being
carried on. Six larger figures occupy the foreground, as follows: On the first sheet
are represented two richly dressed ladies, the one to the left kneeling, turned to-
wards the right, and holding a parcel in her left hand. The one to the right stands,
with the body turned towards the right, but looking down upon the kneeling figure
on the left, and holding in her left hand a vessel suspended by a string. In the
second or middle sheet there is another richly dressed lady, kneeling, with her
body nearly fronting the spectator, while her face, shaded by the left hand, is turned
up towards the group in the third sheet. In her right hand she holdsa fan. On
the third sheet there is a group of three figures. A man, likewise richly dressed,
wearing a sword in his belt, and holding a pipe in his left hand, stands, turned
somewhat towards the left, but looking back upon a lady who kneels to the right
of him and makes an appealing gesture with her left hand. To the right of the
kneeling lady, somewhat back of and bending down towards her, is a second lady,
standing, who makes a gesture of astonishment with her left hand. Both are richly
dressed. The coloring is brilliant, mostly in flat masses, with little modeling or
gradation, except in the sky. The first sheet has 25 printings, the second 26, the
third 23, including a ‘‘blind” impression, which produces an embossed pattern in
the garment of one of the figures.

‘“Yinaka genji” is the title of a Japanese novel, of which this picture is an illus-
tration,

OE
JAPANESE WOOD-CUTTING AND WOOD-CUT PRINTING, 227

c. Red, “yo-k0,” a kind of scarlet (imported), probably carmine.
Formerly the best kind of safflower, called “ki-j0-mi,” was used, but
on account of its present high price the use of ‘“yo-kO” has become
quite popular.

d. Blue, “bero-ai,” is Prussian blue. Formerly “ai-ro” paste, ob-
tained by extraction from blue threads or rags dyed with indigo, or
from “ai-gami,” a paper saturated with indigo, was used. But since
the introduction of Prussian blue from Europe its use has become quite
general.

e. Yellow, *ki-w6,” is orpiment. Formerly ‘zumi,” extracted from a
particular yellow wood; turmeric, “wukon-ko;” and a yellow ocher,
‘““wo-do,” were used, but orpiment has now taken their place.

For mixing these colors water only is used, but never any sizing,
such as glue, except with lampblack, as before stated. A small quan-
tity of rice paste is, however, mixed with the colors on the block or
plank when color prints are to be made.

By mixing these pigments the various hues desired can be obtained,
but the results will be as bright as those shown in “ Yinaka genji” only
in the hands of a skilled workman. There is, however, no particular
method of producing these colors; the result depends entirely on the
practical experience of the printer, who can judge the exact proportions
of the pigments to be mixed, without using either balances or measur-
ing glass, and who does the mixing either in his color dishes or upon
the blocks themselves. Rice paste gives a peculiar luster to the colors,
and much of their beauty depends upon the time and care devoted to
grinding them with water. It is a fact well known to Japanese printers
that skilled hands produce much finer colors with the same pigments
than unskilled hands.

There is a brilliant purple [violet] in ‘‘ Yinaka genji” which has been
taken for an aniline color, although no aniline color has been used in
the printing of this picture. The color in question was obtained by
boiling a certain quantity of red (scarlet) and blue (Prussian blue), such
as those just described, with water, and with proper treatment a bright
purple [violet] can be obtained, almost the same as an aniline purple.
This latter purple, however, has now come more generally into use,
owing to the ease with which it can be managed. <A brown color,
formerly made by mixing red, yellow, and black, has now also been
replaced by ‘‘bengara,” which is a kind of red ocher.

The pigments used for printing ‘“‘Nandina domestica”* are quite
different from those so far spoken of, but the method of using them is
the same. Following is a description of these pigments:

a. Black, “sumi,” the best kind of India ink made in China or Japan

*This picture represents a stalk with leaves and a cluster of the fruit of ‘‘ Nandina
domestica,” a plant belonging to the Barberry family, printed on a sheet measuring
6 inches in breadth by 9% inches in height. It is without a background and with-
out outlines, broadly and effectively modeled, but without any attempt at realistic
rendering, :
228 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

(the particular place is Nara). Itis prepared for use by rubbing it with
water upon the surface of a stone vessel called “ suzuri,” familiar to
every Japanese,

b. White, * gofun,” calcium carbonate {white chalk]. For use it is
put in a color dish, and a few drops of glue solution are added. It is
then rubbed with the finger in contact with the dish, until it becomes
a wet mass and somewhat pasty. <A little glue solution is again added,
and the rubbing repeated, and so on several times. When the mass
has become sufficiently pasty to be made into a pudding, it is beaten
several times against a plank, and then reduced to a thin paste by di-
luting with water.

c. Pink, **sho-yen-ji.” Thisis apparently cochineal, but its chemicai
nature has not yet been ascertained. It is imported from China, in the
form of cotton felt dyed red. To prepare it for use this felt is put into
water and gently pressed. ‘The resulting pink water is poured into a
color dish, and evaporated nearly to dryness in a water bath, or over a
very slow fire, care being taken not to let it dry completely, as other-
wise its brilliancy would be destroyed. It is then kept in a cool place,
and protected from dust by putting a cover on the dish or by placing it
upside down in a box.

d. Blue,‘ ai-bo,” a dark blue, hard stick made of indigo. For use it
is ground, like ** sumi,” in a color dish, with a few drops of glue solu-
tion. When a sufficiently deep blue color has been obtained, it is well
rubbed with the finger in contact with the dish, and then evaporated
to dryness over a slow fire. A few drops of water are now added, the
dish is again placed over a slow fire, the rubbing with the finger gone
through with as before, and water is added gradually, until the proper
shade of color has been obtained. If these directions are not strictly
followed, the pigment is not well diffused in the water, and the result-
ing color, as a matter of course, is not satisfactory. The treatment of
the pigments gofun, shoyen-ji, ai-bo, ete., requires great caution, and
the Japanese printers and painters consider it one of the difficulties of
their art.

e, Yellow, * shi-6.” This is gamboge, and is imported. For use it is
diffused in water, and no glue whatever is added.

JI. Brown, *tai-sha-bo,” a hard, brown stick made of ared ocher. For
use it is treated exactly like “ ai-bo.”

g. Red, “shu,” vermilion. For use it is well mixed with a few drops
of glue solution, ground thoroughly with the finger, and then diluted
with water to the proper consistency.

The following pigments are also used in printing, and samples of them
have been sent to the U. S. National Museum:

Red, “ki-j0-mi,” safflower. This color, in solution, is very apt to suf
fer on exposure to sunlight, and the bottle in which it is sent is, there-
fore, wrapped up in black paper. After it has dried on the paper, it is
not so fugitive as to make it undesirable for printing.
JAPANESE WOOD-CUTTING AND WOOD-CUT PRINTING. 229

Red ocher, “ ben-gara.”

Turmeric, ‘*wakon-ko.”

Yellow ocher, ‘*w0-do.”

Yellow, “zumi,” extract from a particular yellow wood.

Blue, “‘ai-gami.” Paper saturated with a solution of indigo.

Blue, “ai-r0.” Indigo paste.

Of the vehicles used by the printer in the manipulation of his colors,
the following is to be said:

Glue solution. The strength of this solution differs according to the
different pigments, printing papers, silks, etc., to be used,* About one-
third of an ounce of glue to about three-fourths of a pint of water is,
however, an approximate proportion.

Rice paste. This is used for both of the classes of pigments described.
It is made by boiling rice flour with a certain quantity of water, and is
kept in a suitable vessel. Newly made paste is preferable; old and
rotten paste should not be used. The pigment to be used is put on the
block or plank, and some of the paste is then added, care being taken
to mix the two well and evenly by means of a brush. If the printing
brushes are not charged with this paste, the brilliancy of the colors is
much lessened.

THE TOOLS OF THE PRINTER. The use of these tools will be
understood from the examination of Plates vir (1-4), virt (5-17), and
IX, in connection with the following explanations:

1. Bow, tor keeping all the tools and materials required for printing.
The rack on top is used to hang the brushes on, and can be removed
and packed in the box. The paper is kept on the shelf, so as to pre-
vent its drying and being carried away by the draft. The colors are
placed into the lower compartment. The box also serves to keep the
dust and dirt from the paper and the colors.

2. Boards, for pressing wet paper.

3. Small box, for keeping colors, color dishes, ete. This is stored in
the box No. 1, when not in use.

4. Printing table, which, when not in use, serves.to close the front of
box No. 1.

5-7. Brushes, for charging the eut planks with the printing colors,
one particular brush being used for each color. When not in use, they
are hung on the rack on top of box No. 1.

8. Brush, for wetting paper.

9, Oil of Sesamum orientale, contained in a bottle. (See No. 10.)

10. Baren, a little shield which answers the purposes of the Euro.
pean press. After the sheet has been laid down on the plank charged
with color, it is rubbed on the back with the “ baren,” so as to make it
take the impression. The face of the *‘ baren” in contact with the paper
is occasionally rubbed with oil of Sesamum orientale.

11-13. Chisels and a knife, used to correct the registering marks, il’
that should be necessary.
230 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

14. Agitator, for mixing colors in the basin, No. 17.

15. Pads of cotton cloth, to be placed under the four corners of the
planks, while printing, to keep them from moving.

16. The five dry colors described above as used in the printing of
“ Yinaka genji,” put up in bottles.

17. Basin, for mixing colors.

THE PRINTER AND PRINTING. The method of taking.impressions is
illustrated on Plate 1x. The printer seats himself, and arranges all the
tools and materials required, in good order, as shown. The plank to
be printed is placed on the printer’s table A, and the required color is
laid on with the brush B. The paper being ready for printing, and
having been placed upon the shelf C of the box D, a sheet of it is laid
down upon the plank, and is rubbed lightly with the ‘“‘baren” KE. The
printed sheet is then piaced on a board which rests upon the box F,
used for keeping colors, color dishes, etc., and when the required num.
ber of sheets has been printed, they are put back on the shelf C. An-
other plank is now taken, the second impression is made upon the
sheets bearing the first, and this is followed by the third, fourth, ete.,
until the printing is completed.

Charging the block with color. |‘ Inking” the block.| As before
stated, the pigment to be used is put on the block or plank, and some
rice paste is then sprinkled upon it. It is well, also, to soak the brush
properly with this paste, so as to mix it thoroughly with the pigment.
This increases the brilliancy of the colors, and also fixes them more
completely.

Dry impression. |Embossing.| There is a special kind of printing,
called ‘‘ dry impression.” This is used when it is desired to represent
designs of the same color as the ground, but differing in brilliancy. It
is executed after the printing has been finished, and the paper has be-
come quite dry. The sheet is then laid upon a plank specially eut for
the purpose, but not charged with color, and is rubbed with the
 baren.”’*

The “baren” and the method of using it. The “baren” (see Plate x
a-d) is a little hard shield, d, consisting of a stiff disk a, made of
layers of paper pasted together, and turned up at the edge so as to
form a very shallow receptacle, and covered with cotton cloth on the
outside. A second disk b, formed of twisted cord, fits into this shallow
receptacle, and is held in place by the bamboo sheath ce, made of the
ribbed leaf of the bamboo, which is drawn tightly over it and twisted
together on the back, so as to forma handle. This latter is made more
convenient for the hand to grasp it by a strip of paper wound around
it and so arranged as to assume the shape of a rectangular pad.t The

*Some specimens in the U. 8. National Museum show, however, that this emboss-
ing is occasionally done before the printing is finished.

tThis description is based upon the object itself, rather than upon Mr. Tokuno’s
notes.

reason why it is made so hard, besides making the filling of twisted
cord, is to prevent its bending during use. Moreover, if it were not so
hard and rigid, the full stretching of the bamboo sheath would be im-
possible. The ribbed surface of the bamboo serves not only to get a
sharper impression, by limiting the contact to the ribs, but it also pre-
vents the adhesion of the wet paper to the “ baren,” which would occur,
to the spoiling of the paper, if the covering were smooth. The con-
tacting surface should be applied only to those parts of the plank which
have been left standing in relief. If this precaution is neglected, there
is the possibility of smearing from the depressed parts of the block.
The direction in the movemeut of the “baren” should be zigzag, as
shown on Plate x1, but if a very small and isolated part of the design is
to be printed, it is better to give a lighter rub with the edge of the in-
strument. On Plate x11 the dotted line shows the direction of the
“baren,” while the solid curved lines mark the outlines of the design.
The rib of the bamboo sheath should be kept as nearly as possible
at a right angle to the direction. of the ‘ baren.”

Smearing from the depressions of the block. As the depressions of the
eut planks—that is to say, those parts which have been cut away be-
tween the lines and masses of the design—are rather shallow, and at
the same time in many cases quite extensive, it would seem almost im-
possible to prevent the sinking of the sheet into the depressions and
taking the color in these places, more especially when the method of
applying the printing color with a brush is considered, which makes it
impossible to keep the depressions clean. Experienced printers, never-
theless, work without fear of smearing, and no spec ial precautions are
used e guard against it.

Registeri ing. As each color requires a separate cut, each plank must
have certain fixed marks [registering marks], so that all the sheets may
be laid down in exactly the same position, to insure the fitting of each
color upon the others. No mechanical means whatever are used, either
in placing the sheet, or for holding it in position after it has been placed.
The Japanese printer, in these matters’as in all others, depends simply
upon experience. The manner of placing the sheet on the block is
shown on Plate x11. The same figure shows also the registering marks
on the block or plank, which consist of a rectangular notch | at
the right, and a straight notch at the left.

General remarks about printing. The printing may differ in quality,
but the method employed is always : bout the same. The printing of
a picture like ** Nandina domestica ” [which is an imitation of a water-
color painting without outlines| requires, of course, greater skill than
the printing of “ Yinaka genji” [which is a drawing in outlines, with
color washes]. The aim in this case is to produce impressions which
an inexperienced eye can hardly distinguish from the original. But
there is no special way of treating either class of prints. The difference
between the best and the less good is due entirely to the skill of the

232 - REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 18992.

printer in producing the various hues, tints, and shades with printing
brushes, in precisely the same way as the water-color painter. This
holds good also of the engraver. ‘The arts of engraving and of printing
are practiced in Japan according to the dictates of experience, with no,
or at the most but very slight, mechanical assistance.

Cost OF DESIGNS. The original design of “ Yinaka genji,” by Kuni-
teru, called also Yichiyusai, cost 10 yen (about $7.60).

That of **Nandina domestica,” by Chinzan, Tsubaki, cost the same
sum.

COST OF ENGRAVING. ‘“ Yinaka genji,” engraved by Kokichird, Mo-
rikawa, cost 16 yen (about $12.30), and took the engraver about 20 days.
[The three sheet ts, executed respectively in 25, 26, and 23 printings, or
in all 74 printings, required the cutting of 37 blocks. See the notes by
the editor, p. 240, concerning the discrepancy between number of print-
ings and number of blocks. |

‘‘Nandina domestica,” engraved by Kotaré, Kido, cost 8.4 yen (about
$6.38), and took about seven days in the doing. [There are 33 print-
ings, but the number of blocks used is not stated. |

Cost OF PRINTING. The printer of “‘Yinaka genji,” Tsurisabro,
Nakamura, received 70 sen (about 54 cents) per day. He printed 3,000
Sheets per day from the black block, and 700 to 800 sheets per day trom
the color blocks.

The printer of ** Nandina domestica,” Yiwakichi, Yamamoto, received
one yen (about 76 cents) per day. He finished about 200 sheets per
week.

The people engaged in home industries do not generally take a rest
on Sunday. The week, therefore, has seven days of about eight hours
each. As ‘¢ Nandina domestica” has 35 printings, 200 finished sheets
are equal to 6,600 impressions per week, or 943 per day. The numbers
differ, however, according to the different nature of the blocks. Of the
easiest, for instance, such as a uniform green for the leaves, 1,200 to

1,800 sheets can be printed in a day, while of the most difficult ones,
such as those giving the half-tints in the Bie only 600 to 700 sheets

‘an be printed,

NOTES BY THE EDITOR.

To any one familiar with the history of the technique of relief engrav-
ing, the reading of Mr. Tokuno’s communication makes it evident that
the methods used by the Japanese engravers of to-day, so far as they
have not been influenced by European precept, are precisely those used
in Europe in the 15th, 16th and 17th centuries. In other words, these
artists are not, correctly speaking, wood-engravers, but wood-cutters.
This is apparent from the material and the tools used by them.

The material is wood cut in the direction of the fiber, i. e., planks, for
which, since Bewick’s time, blocks cut across the fiber or grain have been
substituted with us.

The tools are knives, which with us have been displaced by gravers

It is interesting to compare the representation of a Japanese wood.
eutter (Pl. v1) with the oldest known representation of a Huropear
wood-cutter (Fig. 2), here reproduced from Jost Amman’s “ Beschrei-
bung aller Stiinde” (generally, although not quite correctly, called
‘Book of Trades”), published in Frankfort-on-the-Main in the year
1568. As Jost Amman was a very prolific designer for wood-cutters,
he must have been thoroughly familiar with the craft, and his repre-
sentation may theretore be

accepted as reliable. At MXN VITA
first sight the way of hold- {| \

ing the tool adopted by Am-
mans  ‘ Formschneider ”
(form-cutter, 7. e., wood-

that of his European prede-
cessor of the sixteenth cen-

to confirm the correctness Rh eit ke eae

of Jost Amman’s delineation.

Of the shape of the knife used by the old wood-cutters of Europe
and of the way of grinding it, we have no positive knowledge, as the
representations of tools which often accompany the monograms of the
“FRormschneider” on sixteenth century wood-cuts are too small, and
oftentimes too fantastic, to be of any use for information. The knives
or “engraving points,” as he called them, used by J. M. Papillon, the
well-kuown French wood-cutter of the eighteenth century, are figured
and fully deseribed in his ‘“*Traité de la Gravure en Bois,” 2 volumes,
Paris, 1766. The blades were nade of clock springs mounted in split
wooden handles, in which they were fastened by means ef a piece of
string wound around them. Fig. 3 shows one of these knives, actual
size, reproduced from Pl]. tv in Papillon’s second volume. It is flat on

the opposite side, and there is a bevel also along the
edge which forms an angle with the long edge of the
knife. This is necessary, because the cutting edge is
the short oblique one and not the long edge. That
this is so is apparent from the way in which the Japa-
nese wood-cutter holds the knife on PI. v1.

It is worth remarking that Papillow’s way of hold-
ing the knife differed radically from that of his Euro-
pean predecessors and of the Japanese wood-cutters
of to-day. Fig. 4, also taken from Papillon’s second
volume, illustrates this point.

In the method of transferring the design to the
plank, we again find a close analogy; for although the
early wood-cut draftsmen of Europe in most cases,
probably, drew their designs directly on the wood
with pen and ink, it is well known also that some-
times the drawing was made on a sheet of paper and
pasted on the plank, face downward, in precisely the
way which is practiced in Japan at present.

Still more curious, however, is the similarity be-
tween the instrument, ‘‘baren,” used by the printers
of Japan, and the earliest contrivance for taking im-
pressions from cut blocks, of which mention is made,
so far as at present known, in a European book. The
“baren” has the form of a little shield. In the treatise
on painting, written by Cennino Cennini da Colle di
Valdelse, towards the close of the fourteenth century,
chapter 173, entitled ‘‘ How to paint on cloth with a
form,” the following directions are given: A wood
block upon which the design has been cut is to be
charged with color. For this purpose a glove is to be
worn on the left hand, the color to be used is to be
spread on the palm of the hand, and the block is then
to be charged with the color, “carefully, so that the
parts eut out do not fill up,” the gloved hand doing
the office of a printer’s ball. The cloth is now to be
charged with color, and then, continues Cennini, “take

a Shield of wood in the right and press with the back upon the surface,
so far as the eut plank will bear it.”* It is, however, apparent from
this most summary description that Cennini’s rude contrivance is not
to be compared for efficiency with the Japanese “baren,” with its
twisted cord packing and ribbed bamboo sheath. Nor does the print-

ing shield mentioned by Cennini seem to have come largely into use,
for the instruments generally supposed to have been employed in
Europe for taking impressions previous to the introduction of the
press are rubbers (which, however, might have been shield-shaped)
_and rollers, of which the latter remained in use for the taking of

proofs down to the time of Papillon, who deseribes and figures them
in the book before cited.

That the method of plugging practiced by the Japanese wood-cut-
ters—evidently by square instead of rotind plugs—is the same as the
old European method is not to be wondered at in view of the identity
of the materials used.

With these elementary factors of materials, tools, and appliances, the
similarity between Japanese and sixteenth century European wood.
cutting ends, however, and further examination discloses differences of
a very marked kind.

It is well-known that the work of the old Huropean wood-cutters is
essentially black-line facsimile, 7. e., the reproduction, more or less
faithfully, of drawings in black lines, generally pen-and-ink drawings,
on alight ground. It was this limitation which threw the wood- cut out
of the race with the other reproductive arts, until it was enabled to
enter the lists again after it had been transformed into wood-en-
graving. The wood-cutters and printers of Europe did, indeed, attempt
to produce color effects as early as 1457, this being the year in which
appeared Fust and Schoeffer’s Psalter, the first dated printed book, so
far as we know, and at the same time the first dated piece of color-
printing. This, however, was merely work of a decorative character.
The first pictures really printed in colors are Cranach’s chiaroscuros,
the oldest of which are dated 1506, and, of works printed in positive
colors, Jost de Negker’s portrait of Jacob Fugger, about 1512, and
Altdorfer’s Beautiful Maria of Ratisbonne, about 1519. But of these
two kinds of productions, only the first, the chiaroscuros (clairobseurs,
Helldunkel)—that is to say, imitations of India ink and sepia drawings
and other monochromes—came largely into use during the sixteenth,
seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries, while the attempts to introduce
printing from relief blocks in positive colors, although renewed from
time to time, never succeeded to any extent, so that it may be said even
to-day that chromoxylography is practiced only occasionally, except
for such coarse work as advertisements, show bills, ete.*

The Japanese, as a matter of course, have also produced and. still
produce facsimiles of drawings in black lines, but owing, possibly, to
the fact that their artists use the brush instead of the pen or some
still more unyielding point, they were soon led to attempt the repro-
duction of washed drawings, not only in black and grays, but also in
positive colors. Their earliest productions of this kind do not, indeed,
according to Prof. pores go back bey ond about the year Tig8; t but

“AS oe notes treat only of Pelier eine no account is en here af chromo-
chalcography and chromolithography.
tThere is considerable variation in the statements found in books concerning the
oldest specimens of Japanese color-printing. From Dr. Justus Brinckmann’s Kunst
und Handwerk in Japan (Berlin, 1889, p. 222), we learn that these specimens, accord-
ing to a Japanese author, Sakakiwara, date from the year 1695, although on p. 237

they made up for their later appearance in the field by a prodigious ac-
tivity and a superb facility of execution—within the limitations of their
art—that far outstripped the isolated achievements of their earlier Kuro-
pean colleagues.

We have seen that, according to Mr. Tokuno, the highest aim of .
Japanese chromoxylography is the imitation of the original, even to
the sweep of the brush, so close that an inexperienced eye shall find it
difficult to tell the printed counterfeit from the painting made by the
hand of the artist, and it must be admitted that the wood cutters and
printers of Japan have been wonderfully successful in their efforts, not
only in the reproduction of black-and-whites, for which, also, several
printings are generally used, but quite as much with designs in color.
It is true, certainly, that Japanese painting lends itself more easily to
deceptive imitation than HKuropean painting; but there is still another
cause to be assigned for the success of Japanese color-printing in this
respect, and that is the method of printing practiced by the Japanese,
or, more correctly speaking, their method of charging (‘‘inking”) the
block.*

of the same book it is stated that Torii Kiyonobu, who was not born until 1688, was
the first painter who had his designs reproduced by color-printing. According to
Theodore Duret (see Chronik fiir vervielfiiltigende Kunst, 1889, No. 6), the first color-
prints with two or three tints were produced between 1710 and 1720. Finally, ae-
cording to Dr. Wm. Anderson, the author of the Catalogue of Prints and Books
illustrating the History of Engraving in Japan, issued by the Burlington Fine Arts
Club in 1888, the date is about the year 1700 (see p. xvi1 of the catalogue named).
Prof. Fenollosa, however, is of opinion that these earlier specimens were not color-
prints, but colored prints, i. e., prints tinted by hand.

* Dr. Brinekmann, p. 230 of the book previously quoted, says that in Japan ‘we
look in vain for the painted types of the color-prints, since the artist who work3
for color-printing creates independent works of art by its means,” while, on the con-
trary, he says of us that we claim triumphantly to have reached our aim in repro-
duction ‘when it becomes impossible to tell the original from the copy without
close investigation.” Dr. Brinckmann, indeed, contradicts himself, when, on p. 288,
he speaks of the publication of the paintings of Korin and of his brother Kenzan, a
celebrated ceramic artist, by Hoitsu, about a century after the death of these artists,
and Mr. Tokuno’s statement that the highest aim of Japanese printing ‘is to pro-
duce impressions which an inexperienced eye can hardly distinguish from the origi-
nal,” certainly shows that the first statement made by the author named, however
broadly it may apply to certain kinds of printing, is not true absolutely. More-
over, among the specimens sent to the U.S. National Museum by Mr. Tokuno, there
are several reproductions of paintings, including a book in two volumes, “Shu bigwa
kan,” or reduced copies of pictures drawn by eminent old artists of the Kioto or Shijo
school.

Color-prints made without painted originals to work from are also found among
our own productions, although they are of a subordinate rank and do not aspire to
rival the brilliant productions of the Japanese color-printers. Sketches in color are
rarely made for the colored pictures in the comic journals like ‘‘ Puck.” These pic-
tures are printed from four stones, one giving the design and modelling in black or
brown, the other three supplying the coloring by means of Iris tints, two running
in one direction, the third at right angles to it, and these Iris tints are mostly ad-
justed on the press under the direction of the designer, without an original by
238 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

The old printers of Europe, down to the beginning of this century,
inked their blocks with printer’s balls, such as are shown in Fig. 5,
reproduced from Jost Amman’s ‘¢Charta Lusoria,” published at Nurem-
berg inthe year 1588. The custom of the present day is to use elastic
Tollers, made of amass consisting of glue, molasses, etc. On our steam
presses the inking is also done by rollers. The ink used in all cases

which to be guided. A small specimen of this kind is shown in Frame 67 A, on the
eastern side of the Hall of Graphie Arts. Much more brilliant work has, however,
been done by the same means. The old chiaroseuro printers were also in a measure
independent of the artist, not only sometimes adding tints to designs by artists long
dead, but varying these tints for the same picture. The tint blocks for Diirer’s por-
trait of Varnbuler, for instance, were added after his death, and there are impressions
in brownish and in greenish tints. In this ease the liberties taken by the printer
"were permissible, from the same cause which favors the Japanese color-printers, that
is to say, because the coloring and lighting of the old chiaroscuros are purely con-

ventional.
JAPANESE WOOD-CUTTING AND WOOD-CUT PRINTING. 239

the hands of an intelligent being. The roller, on the contrary, even in
the hands of the most skilled printer, is much less pliable, and on the
steam press it is without any pliancy. This quality has, indeed, be-
come a merit in the steam press, so that it is now looked upon as more
reliable than the hand press. But this is true only in so far as uni-
formity of result in the impressions is concerned. The artist can do
nothing with it, while with a bare block or plate and a brush full of
color he can do wonders. We have seen this of late years in the re-
newed development of the monotype, and it may, indeed, be said of
Japanese printing that it involves, at least in its best productions, the
principle of the monotype. It follows from this that the Japanese
printer must be something of an artist. In the words of Mr. Tokuno,
he must have the skill to produce “the various hues and shades with
printing brushes, in precisely the same way as the water-color painters
do.” .

As the color is laid on the block with the brush, the facilities offered
by this tool can, as a matter of course, be utilized, and are utilized to
their fullest extent, by the Japanese printer. He can deposit more or
less pigment on the block, according as he may need a stronger or a
more delicate tint, and he can even produce gradations on it quite inde-
pendent of the wood-cutter; that is to say, on a perfectly flat block. All
the gradations from light to dark seen in Japanese color-prints are the
result of the printer’s brush used on the block, assisted sometimes, it
is said, by wiping with the finger. The roller which we use for inking
our blocks is not capable of producing such gradations,* as it deposits
a uniform film of ink all over the surface. The consequence is that
with us the gradations are produced by the engraver, who cuts away
more and more of the wood, either in lines or in dots, as he proceeds
from dark through lighter tints to white, while the Japanese wood-
cutter furnishes to the printer blocks which are solid even in those
parts which in the impression are to be gradated. It follows that what
we call “engraved tints,” either flat or gradated, are never seen in
purely Japanese wood-cuts. The blocks offer nothing but flat masses,
and such lines as appear in them serve merely to bring out the forms,
patterns of stuffs, textures, etc. Whenever a European engraver has
to render a sky gradated simply from a darker blue, through lighter
tints downward, and finally merging into a tint so light that he must
express it by white, he cuts a series of white lines, narrower and farther
apart where the color is to be strongest, and gradually increasing in
width and nearness as it decreases in strength, until, where the white
paper is to show, he cuts away all the wood. His Japanese colleague,
on the contrary, gives the printer a flat block, on which those parts
merely are cut away which correspond to objects seen against the sky,
such as trees, mountains, houses, ete., and which, therefore, must be
kept free from the blue of the sky behind them. On this block the

240 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

printer paints the gradations needed, and if he can not get a satisfac-
tory result with one printing, he uses the same block twice, only vary-
ing the “inking.” In the picture “ Yinaka genji,” for instance, the sky
is printed once with a gradation reaching from the top of the picture
to about the middle of the sky, and again a second time with a grada-
tion reaching considerably farther down. It is evident that the upper
part of the sky may thus be strengthened, and the gradual shading-
off into the white along the horizon made still more gradual.

From what has just been said, it is apparent that the same block
may be used twice on the same picture. This is true not only of the
printing of skies, but the same device is resorted to also in other parts
of the design. A block may be printed in a flat tint or color the first
time, and it may then be charged a second time with another color,
say a gray, but gradated, and printed on top of the first color to pro-
duce modulations. The number of planks cut for a Japanese color-
print, therefore, is very far from corresponding to the number of print-
ings. It is, moreover, reduced still further by painting the same block
with different colors in different parts. These colors may, indeed, be
printed at the same time,* but it happens frequently that they are used
separately; that is to say, that the block is painted and printed in part
only, and then laid aside, to be taken up again later and painted on
those parts which were left uninked before. Thus of the three sheets
which together make up the picture ‘“Yinaka genji,” the first has 25
impressions, the second 26, the third 23. Of blocks used, however,
there are only 138 for the first, 10 for the second, and 14 for the third, or
37 cuts, executed on 21 planks, for 74 printings.

It is seen from the number of impressions needed for the completion
of the picture just alluded to, that the Japanese printers are not bent
on saving labor in this respect. a fact which is occasionally shown in a
most curious Manner, aS When a single pair of red lips is printed by
itself in a flat red, although several other red blocks are used for the
same picture. From 23 to 26 impressions for a print like ‘‘ Yinaka
genji,” seems to us an excessive number. Even for a refined, although
brilliant fruit piece, like “Nandina domestica,” 33 printings impresses
us as extraordinary, in spite of the fact that the use of flat blocks makes
it necessary to multiply them so as to produce the desired gradations.
With our means of producing gradations by either wood-engraving

*According to Dr. Brinckmann (p. 228), the inking of one block with several colors
is occasionally carried so far as to produce a complete picture inseveral colors at one
impression. Among other prints, he describes one of a gray grasshopper feeding on
the reddish meat of a piece of watermelon, the green rind and the black seeds of
which are also seen. The four colors named are applied, each separately, to dif-
ferent parts of the block. We have here the principle of rubbing in a plate in
different colors, used so extensively by the printers of the colored stipples produced
in the eighteenth century and now again popular. The principle has not, however,
been applied to relief printing among us, except by Wm. Blake, and even by him
only to a very limited extent.
JAPANESE WOOD-CUTTING AND WOOD-CUT PRINTING. 24]

or lithographing, 8 to 10 printings would be considered a large number
for the reproduction of an original of similar character. But even
33 is not the highest number of impressions used, I am informed by
Prof. Fenollosa that as many as 120 impressions were used lately on a
reproduction of a Japanese water-color painting, although the number
was considerably reduced in the printing of a subsequent edition of the
same picture by a different manipulation of the blocks.* It may be of
interest to state here, for the sake of comparison, that the highest num-
ber of printings used on our most complicated chromolithographs is
about fifty.

From the statement by Mr. Tokuno concerning the pigments used in
characteristically Japanese color-printing, 7. ¢., blue, yellow, and red,
besides black and white, it would seem as if the whole system of this
kind of printing were based upon the old three-color theory, which pre-

railed also with the early chromochalecographie and chromolithographic

printers of Europe. It is nevertheless true that the Japanese print-
ers do not, at present at least, produce the so-called secondary colors,
green, orange, violet, by printing the so-called primaries, 7. e., blue and
yellow for green, yellow and red for orange, and red and blue for
violet, over one another. Wherever these secondaries” are needed—
and the same observation holds good also for the ‘‘tertiaries ”—they are
printed by themselves, although the “primaries” which enter into them
may occur in the same picture. I amagain indebted to Prof. Fenollosa
for having called my attention to the fact that the printing of the
‘‘primaries” over one another to produce the “secondaries” does, in-
deed, occur in the earlier work of the Japanese printers, but it is evi-
dent that it has now been abandoned. As subdued and broken colors
were mainly used in the earlier Japanese color-prints, while the modern
show a decided preference for brilliant and even glaring coloring, it is
quite likely that this printing of the “primaries” over one another,
which with us is considered a decided advantage, more especially in
cheaper and simpler grades of work, as it saves time and money, was
given up, even in such work as the printing of pictures for fans, for the
sake of the more brilliant effects which can be produced by mixing the
pigments themselves.

This brings us to another point of great importance, and that is the
little care had by the Japanese wood-cutters and printers for labor-saving
devices and mechanical aids. ‘* Our arts of engraving and printing,”
says Mr. Tokuno in one of his letters, ‘‘ rely entirely upon experience,
with no, or very slight mechanical assistance.” The manual skill, which
has grown out of this reliance upon experience and disdain for mechan-
ical aids, is truly marvelous. It is difficult to believe that all Japan-

“The earliest attempts at color-printing made by the Japanese, were, of course,
much simpler, beginning with from two to four blocks. See Dr. Anderson’s cata-
logue, before quoted, p. Xvit; also Brinckmann.

242 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

ese wood-cutting, even to the finest lines in the most delicate black-
and-white facsimile work, is done with the one clumsy knife repre-
sented in Fig. 1. We know from Papillon’s book that he found it nee-
essary to use three grades of knives, according to the grade of work to
be executed, and we naturally arrive at the conclusion that the Japan-
ese wood-cutter alsoac commodates his knife to his work. Neverthe-
less, Mr. Tokuno replies to a direct question on this point: * Our
engraving on wood depends wholly on the skill of the engravers. With
only one knife, such as that sent you, they can execute all grades of
work, from the roughest to the finest. We therefore have no other
kind of knife.”

The answers given to questions regarding the difficulties which con-
front the Japanese printer, and which to us would seem insurmounta-
ble, are of the same tenor. It seems impossible to prevent smearing,
with blocks having great shallow hollows, inked with a brush, and
therefore charged with color, not only on the parts left standing in
relief, but also in the depressions, and with the thin moist paper used,
held down on the plank with one hand, while the other guides the
“baren.” To the question whether any special precautions are adopted
to prevent smearing, Mr. Tokuno replies: ‘* Although smearing from
the depressions in the block seems almost unavoidable, experienced
printers, nevertheless, work without fear of it, and there is no special
way of preventing it.” Again, to the question whether mechanical
means are not used for registering, the reply is: ‘*‘ Our printers use no
mechanical means whatever, depending simply upon experience.” To
illustrate this point, a water-color drawing was sent, of which Plate XII
is a reproduction. To the inquiry, how it is possible to print with
water-colors on moist paper, keep the paper moist to prevent contrac-
tion, and lay the sheets on top of one another without offsetting, the
answer given is: ‘This can only be done well by an experienced
printer,” to which laconic statement a few technical points are added,
which have already been given in Mr. Tokuno’s communication.

A visitor to the U.S. National Museum, who sees, forthe first time, and
without explanation, the exhibit of Japanese wood-cutting and wood-cut
printing, the whole (except the printed specimens and the drawings ilus-
trating tools, ete.) crowded into a case measuring about 4 by 34 by 25 feet,
will most probably take it for granted that he has before him a collection
of miniature models. In this assumption he would, however, be grossly
mistaken. Considerably more room would, of course, be needed to
arrange the tools, ete., for practical working use, but both the tools and
the materials shown are actually those employed by the wood-cutters
and printers of Japan. It needs only to think of the heavy machinery
used by our printers, even by those who confine themselves to taking
proofs for wood-engravers, to realize the contrast between the methods
of Japan and our own. Other occasions for comparing these methods
have been brought out by the questions addressed to Mr. Tokuno, as
JAPANESE WOOD-CUTTING AND WOOD-CUT PRINTING. 243

given above, and the answers returned by him. The contrast becomes
still more marked when we recall, for instance, the methods of prepar-
ing colors described by Mr. Tokuno, It is true, no doubt, that, influ-
enced by us, the Japanese are coming to depend more and more on
machinery, but it is also-true that by their old and simple methods,
trusting to their experience, their skill, and their artistic feeling, they
have produced the best of their work, in which their national charac-
teristics have found their most original expression. Nor have they, ac-
cording to Mr. Tokuno’s statements, suffered in productiveness in con-
sequence of their methods. The short time spent in eutting the 37
planks needed for the printing of ‘* Yinaka genji,” 7. e., twenty days, is
astonishing enough in spite of the simplicity of the blocks, but our as-
tonishment increases to wonder when we read of the number of im-
pressions made per day by the Japanese printers, and consider at the
same time the tedious methods employed in charging the block with
color. As I feared a misunderstanding on my part of the figures
given by Mr. Tokuno, I asked him to consider my interpretation of
his statements, and in reply the original figures were confirmed, viz.,
3,000 sheets per day of about eight hours from the black block, and
700 to 800 sheets per day from the color blocks of “* Yinaka genji,”
and on an average 943 sheets per day of ‘‘ Nandina domestica,” the
number varying from 1,800 for the simplest to 600 for the most diffi-
cult blocks. It is impossible to make a direct comparison between the
productivity of the Japanese and our own printers, as the methods
differ too radically, and as long editions of wood-engravings are but
very rarely printed nowadays on the hand-press. The following figures
will nevertheless be of some interest: Mr. Thos. H. Brennan, wood-
engraving proof-printer, of Boston, assures me that 250 impressions
from a block measuring 11 by 14 inches and 350 from one measuring 5
by 7 inches is a fair average for a working day of nine hours. his is,
of course, for first-class work and for first-class engraving. Messrs.
L. Prang & Co., the well known chromolithographers, also of Boston,
write me that the number of impressions which a lithographic printer
prints on the hand-press, whether it be from a crayon stone or a pen-
and-ink stone, in black or in colors, varies from 175 to-250 per day of
nine hours, and that 200 would be considered a good average.

It goes without saying that the Japanese methods described above
are not suitable for application to our art. A complicated sky, for in-
stance, with all its wealth of delicate tints, such as we find it in the
works of our best landscape painters, or the human countenance, ex-
pressive of the deepest emotions of the soul, as our best figure painters
set it up before us, can be interpreted for us by the skill of our wood
engravers, and even their coloring can be successfully approached by
our color-printing processes in their most refined development, but they
can never be rendered by means of flat blocks, even when painted in
delicate gradations by the most skilled of Japanese printers. In try-

ing to arrive at an estimate of Japanese color-printing, it must not be
forgotten, therefore, that problems like those just alluded to are never
otfered to the Japanese reproductive artists. The originals which they
are asked, not to interpret, but rather to imitate, or the original color-
prints which they produce, are, indeed, exceedingly beautiful, and
worthy of attentive study as giving embodiment to the ideals of a
highly gifted people, moving in an intellectual atmosphere quite differ-
ent from our own, but it remains true, nevertheless, that they are purely
and frankly conventional. Looking at the technical side of the question
only, it may be said that it is this fact which has enabled the Japanese
wood-cutters and printers to find methods answering their wants almost
to perfection. In amore searching study of Japanese art, other con-
ditions would, indeed, also have to be considered, but their discussion
would be out of place in a report like the present, which is of necessity
limited to a statement of facts.

In the preparation of these essays I have had several objects in
view, among which are a further presentation of elementary matter
pertaining to biological geology than has before been published, the
defense of biology as an indispensable aid in geological investigation
and the repudiation of certain untenable claims that have been made
in its favor, an application of the principles discussed to the practical
work of the geologist, and the demonstration of the necessity of the
preservation of fossil remains in public museums as storehouses of
evidence upon geological questions. These essays are therefore con-
fined mainly to a discussion of questions pertaining to bioiogical
geology, including both its structural and systematic branches, only
incidental reference being made to other important branches of geo-
logieal science, such as mineralogy, lithology, dynamic geology, ete.

I have intended an approximately full statement of the subjects
selected for discussion as well as scientific accuracy in my conclusions,
but in the manner of their presentation I have chosen to address gen-
eral readers and students of geology as well as special investigators.
Ihave accordingly presented a more detailed and methodical state-
ment of the principal facts upon which biological geology is based
than otherwise would have been thought desirable. Every working
geologist is necessarily more or less familiar with the principles and
criteria which are based upon these facts, but a comprehensive knowl-
edge of them is not yet accessible to the student except by personal
experience or didactic instruction; that is, because these principles
and eriteria have not yet been systematically and fully stated in pub-
lished works the greater part of accessible knowledge concerning them
is traditional.

It is true that some of the knowledge referred to has been briefly
and more or less clearly presented in text-books, but the elements of
biological geology are too comprehensive to allow of a satisfactory
summary in even the largest of them. All discussions of principles
and eriteria pertaining to that subject are also usually omitted by
authors of other works, evidently upon the reasonable ground that
scientific writings ought not to be encumbered by a repetition of ele-
mentary principles, and upon the less reasonable assumption that the

247
248 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

reader is familiar with and accepts as trustworthy those which they
have adopted for their own guidance.

If it were not for my evident need of frequent reference to such
elementary matter the desirability of publishing it in this connection
might perhaps be questioned by those who are already familiar with
it and with the range of its applicability. Still, the working geologist
needs only to recall his early embarrassments and later experiences to
be assured that the time has not yet passed when even the frequent
enunciation of elementary truths is of material benefit to the student.
I not only have not hesitated to adopt such a treatment of the subjects
of these essays, but I have not sought to avoid numerous trite remarks
and commonplace statements. These, however, are employed not so
much for the purpose of conveying information as for that of giving
logical continuity to the statement of my own ideas and of leaving the
least possible room for doubt as to my meaning.

The relation of biology to geological investigation is so fundamental
and the facts pertaining to it are so concrete and so accordant with
both biological and physical laws, that the prevalence of any opposition
to its legitimate claims seems unnatural. It is also unnatural that
claims should still be made in favor of that relation which are not sup-
ported by the principles of modern biology. Of late years, however,
such wide differences of opinion have become prominent, some of them
being especially so among American geologists. In their writings
some of these authors either entirely ignore biological evidence as
furnished by fossil remains or treat the best of it as being of little
importance in the investigation of structural geology. Others have
taken quite opposite ground, not only making the just claim that
biological evidence is indispensable in structural geology, but the
untenable one that it is absolute and exclusive in systematic geology.
Notwithstanding the prevalence of these extreme views, I have ab-
stained from a controversial attitude in the treatment of the subjects
to which they pertain, preferring to attempt their statement in such a
way that the reader will necessarily reach correct conclusions.

Because it is necessary to discuss those differences of opinion in these
essays, it is desirable to refer briefly to their origin and the causes of
their perpetuation. Doubtless some of the causes of their existence
are remote or obscure, but it is apparent that they are largely due to
the broadening of the field of geological investigation, making it neces-
sary that it should be divided into numerous specialties. In such cases
it is natural that differences of opinion should be greatest between
those investigators whose chosen studies are most diverse in character.
Another cause is doubtless one of inheritance from the early condition
of both geological and biological science.

A special cause of ‘the perpetuation of these extreme views evi-
dently exists in the form of personal domination by such of those who
entertain them as happen to possess unusual opportunities for their
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 249

enforcement. It is well known that such influence has at various times
and in various ways retarded the progress of geological science and
that there is danger of its being exercised in all cases when the per-
sonal judgment of an observer is liable to be modified or controlled
by official or other temporary authority.

The opinions which have been referred to as the result of inherited
errors are mainly those which relate to the application of biology to
systematic geology. They are evidently due to the difference of ability
or of inclination among the authors who have written upon those sub-
jects, to adjust the early methods of thought which they have adopted
to those which were made necessary by the great revolution in the
views of naturalists upon the subject of evolution, which took place
after standards for both biology and geology had been formulated and
generally adopted. I regard this cause as being so important that I
have arranged the discussions of the geological scale now in use so
that they embrace references to the condition of thought among pro-
moters of geological science from about 25 years before the revolution to
the present time.

It is apparent, however, that, besides, the tendency to follow estab-
lished channels of thought, which has just been referred to the contin-
uance of these differences of opinion, and the consequent differences in
practice among geologists, are largely due to the fact that the princi-
ples and criteria which are necessary to constitute a standard or series
of standards which shall accord with modern views of biology have
never been conventionally formulated and published. It is very desir-
able that concerted attempts toward such formulation should be made,
but it is nevertheless true that the necessity for a special exercise of
personal judgment in every act of geological investigation renders
exact formulation peculiarly difficult.

The attempts toward enunciating principles and formulating criteria
which are made in these essays have been suggested by those of my
own geological investigations which have been prosecuted mainly from
a biological standpoint. Among the incentives to these attempts has
been a desire to give to the readers of my published writings upon the
subjects referred to a more explicit statement of the grounds of cer-
tain opinions therein expressed than it was practicable to make in those
writings. Indeed I believe the present general condition of geological
science in all its departments demands from its active investigators
some more definite public exposition of principles, and even of certain
elements, than has yet been published. It is at least apparent that
such publications for each subordinate branch of geology would be of
great service to students because it would give them greater facility in
comprehending the meaning of authors, aud it would enable the latter
to write more concisely and intelligibly, as well as more accurately,
upon the results of their investigations. It would also give authors in
the different branches of geology an opportunity to become better
250 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

acquainted with the character and value of the work done by their
colleagues.

The differences of opinion which have been referred to have neces-
sarily produced corresponding differences in practice among geologists,
and I have therefore found it necessary to consider them in connection
with the application of the principles discussed in these essays to the
practical work of the geologist. In doing so I have taken occasion to
show that both extremes have had the effect not only to retard the
progress of geological science, but to diminish the practical value of
geological investigation. Furthermore, I have taken every oppor-
tunity to insist that notwithstanding the paramount value of fossil
remains in structural and systematic geology the geologist, when in-
vestigating these subjects will be without excuse if he should fail to
avail himself of every attainable relevant fact, whether biological or
physical.

Finally, | have undertaken to point out some of the legitimate claims
which geological science may make, not only upon individual investi-
gators, but upon museums, and scientific organizations, and to show
that these claims are based upon the necessities of science and not upon
a sentimental idea.

I. THE CHARACTER AND ORIGIN OF FOSSIL REMAINS.

In prosecuting the study of the fossil remains of animals and plants,
the investigator may have either one or the other of its two leading
objects in view, but each being so closely related to the other it is al-
ways essential that they should be pursued with direct relation to each
other. In the first case, the leading object to be attained is the exten-
sion of our knowledge of the animal and vegetable kingdoms far beyond
that Which may be acquired by the study of living animals and plants,
and in the second case itis to apply that knowledge to the study of
structural and systematic geology. The object in the first case is
purely paleontological; in the second it is not only to acquire paleonto-
logical knowledge, but to apply it to various branches of geological in-
vestigation.

This essay, like the others which follow it, is written with imme-
diate reference to the latter object, but the facts presented in it are of
equal importance to the former. My principal purpose in writing it
is the presentation of such facts as indicate the true significance and
value of fossil remains in geological investigation that the references
which are made in the following chapters may be the better understood.
While I endeavor to point out clearly those facts which show the
paramount value of fossil remains in geological investigation, I do
not hesitate to also point out their imperfection as representatives of
formerly existing faunas and floras as well as of separate members of
the same. This candid treatment of the subject is not only proper in
itself, but it is necessary in view of the fact that in the following essays
I oppose certain views which are shown by geological literature to
be held by many authors, especially those which indicate an under-
estimation of the value of all fossil remains on the one hand and the
relative overestimation of the value of certain kinds on the other. A
large part of this essay is of the most elementary character, but the
necessity for having such elementary matter at hand for reference has
already been pointed out, and it will further appear in the following
essays.

The substance of the bodies of animals considered with reference to
the subject of fossilization may conveniently be divided into soft and
hard parts. The soft parts are those constituting the organs by which
the physiological functions of the body are performed, together with
their connecting tissues, while the hard parts are skeletal and protee-
tive in their character. Some animals are destitute of either skeletal
or hard protective parts, and their bodies are therefore wholly soft or
fleshy.

The soft parts of animals are always so soon and so completely de-
composed after death that they are never really fossilized, but in rare
252 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

sases the form of some of them has been preserved in tine sediments
in the condition of imprints and molds.* Therefore in the study of
fossil zoology we are, with the rare exceptions just indicated, confined
to an investigation of the skeletal and protective parts of animals, be-
zause these parts alone are capable of true fossilization.

Those parts of the living animal are largely composed of mineral
substances, and they are of various kinds and character, some being
chitinous and some corneous, but the greater part are composed of
lime compounds, the most common of which are bones and shells. They
often are of different composition in different families or other divisions
of the animal kingdom, and often thus different in different parts of the
same animal. Being originally composed of mineral substances in inti-
mate association with a smali proportion of animal matter, and being
usually still further mineralized by replacement of the animal by min-
eral matter in the process of fossilization, they become nearly or quite
as indestructible as are inorganic minerals. It is, however, true that
all kinds of hard parts of animals, even those originally containing the
greatest proportion of mineral substance, if exposed continuously to the
atmosphere after the death of the animal, will, within a few years at
most, become as completely decomposed as will the soft parts. That
is, the hard parts of animals may become permanently fossilized under
favorable conditions, or they may become as completely decomposed
under those that are unfavorable as will the soft parts under all con-
ditions.

Compared with animals, the proportion of the component substance
of plants, except that of a few kinds which quickly decompose after
death, is very small. Much the greater proportion of the substance of
all of them, aside from water, is carbonaceous and comparatively slow to
decompose, but none of it resists decomposition so fully as does most of
the skeletal and protective parts of animals. Still, the complete decom-
position of all plants is certain unless they fall under conditions which
are specially favorable to their preservation. Therefore in the study of
fossil botany we are confined to an investigation of imprints, mostly of
leaves, and of such of the woody parts as may have become antiseptically
changed by saturation with certain acids or with soluble salts, or com-
pletely mineralized by a process to which I have applied the term histo-
metabasist. Immense quantities of vegetable substance have in past
geological time been accumulated and reduced to the fixed condition of
‘rarbon and thus permanently preserved in the form of coal, but this
substance has seldom been found of material use in the study of fossil
botany.

“See the close of this essay for an explanation of the different forms and con-
ditions in which fossils are found and the different methods by which they have
reached those conditions and acquired those forms.

RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 253

Because even the hardest and most enduring of the component sub-
stances of animalsand plants become entirely decomposed if continuously
exposed to the atmosphere after death, it is necessary to their permanent
preservation that they should fall under such conditions as exclude the
atmosphere. Almost the only way in which this can be accomplished
in a natural manner is by their subaqueous intombment in the con-
stantly accumulating sediments which are deposited at the bottom of
all bodies of water. In the cases of aquatic animals such intombment
of their remains is a necessary result of the nature of their habitat, but
the remains of land animals and plants must reach such intombment
accidentally if at all. The manner in which remains of land animals
reach the waters, in the sediments of which they become intombed, is by
accidentally falling into those waters and sinking there, or into tribu-
tary streams which transport them to the intombing sediments, their
transportation being sometimes facilitated by buoyant gases which
accumulate in recently dead bodies. Furthermore, the annual freshets
which sweep the flood plains of rivers transport to such a sedimentary
intombment remains of the various animals which at other times safely
dwell there. Plant remains reach such intombment in similar ways,
and also by the action of the winds. In the latter class of cases they
are in the form of leaves and small fragments of the plants which grew
in the vicinity of bodies of water. Besides the methods just mentioned
remains of both animals and plants not unfrequently become intombed
in the slime and flood accretions of marshes.

It will be shown on following pages that the difference in the condi-
tions under which the various kinds of fossil remains have been pre-
served has much significance to the geologist, but it is proper to remark
here that the more quiet the prevailing physical conditions and the less
the necessity for the transportation of those remains to reach sediment-
ary intombment the more likely were they to become fossilized and pre-
served in a favorable condition for study. The conditions presented by
an open seacoast were specially unfavorable because ef the constant
triturating action of the waves. It is doubtless mainly for this reason
that so few remains of land animals and plants are found in marine
deposits, notwithstanding the comparatively abundant opportunity that
such remains must have had of being cast into marine waters.

It is of such aqueous sediments as have just beenreferred to that the
stratified formations of the earth are composed, and it is such remains
of animals and plants as have just been mentioned that constitute the
fossils which are found to characterize them,

The statements which have just been made indicate that some kinds
of the animals and plants which existed in former geological epochs
could not have become represented by fossil remains in the sedimentary
formations, because no part of their bodies was fossilizable. They also
indicate that of those which might have become thus represented the
representation of some of them is necessarily less complete than is that
254 REPOKT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

of others, because their fossilizable parts were less indestructible in
some cases and the conditions necessary to their fossilization were less
favorable in others. Furthermore, they show that while the preserva-
tion of the remains of some animals was a natural result of the condi-
tions under which they lived, that of the remains of other animals and
of plants was in all cases the result of accidental or unusual conditions.

The following brief review of the animal and vegetable kingdoms is
presented for the purpose of further applying the general statements
that have just been made to the subject of this essay and of com-
paring our presumably obtainable knowledge of extinct animal and
vegetable forms with our more definite knowledge of those which now
exist. The legitimate methods of this comparison have to some extent
just been indicated and they will be further shown on subsequent pages.
In the following remarks it will be necessary also to make some com-
parisons of the now living land and aquatic animals, respectively, with
those which lived in past geological epochs.

If such a comparison could be made of all living with all extinet
animals, the proportion of now living Jand. animals would doubtless be
shown to be much greater as a whole than it was during past geological
time, because in the earlier geological periods there were probably no land
animals in existence, and their proportional numbers have since grad-
ually increased. In discussing certain of the higher classes, however,
mammals and birds for example, I assume that the proportion of
extinct aquatic to land denizens was not far from the same that it now
is, because the latter animals lived only in later geological time, dur-
ing which time their general conditions of life have probably suffered
comparatively little essential change.

Vertebrata.—Excluding some of the lowest and also some coubtful
or exceptional forms, all vertebrates possess either well developed teeth
or a bony skeleton, and much the greater part of them possess both.
Under favorable conditions the fossilization of these animal substances is
complete. Therefore, having fallen under such conditions, aimost any
vertebrate animal which existed in former geological time is likely to have
left fossii remains. The epidermal structures, such as horns, hoofs,
feathers, ete., which cover either the whole or portions of the bodies of
certain vertebrates, being more destructible than bones and teeth, are
not often preserved in a fossil condition except as imprints or casts.
This remark, however, does not apply to the scales of teleost fishes,
which, although epidermal in their character, are nearly or quite as
indestructible as are the bones and teeth of those animals.

Although the members of the orders Cetacea and Sirenia, and of the
family Phocide* of the order Carnivora, are very numerous, they con-
stitute only a small proportion of the whole class Mammalia, and it is
these families alone every member of which is fully adapted to an aquatic

*The small family to which the walruses belong should also be included here.

RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 255

life. A considerable number of other mammals, such as various car-
nivores, rodents, etc., are amphibious in their habits, but far the greater
part of this important class are dwellers upon the land. Therefore, while
remains of the extinct representatives of the aquatic animals just
mentioned would naturally have become intombed in the sediments of
the waters in which they lived, and have there become fossilized,
remains of representatives of the strictly land mammals could have
reached a similar intombment only in the indirect manner that has
already been explained. That is, the intombment of the remains of
the aquatic mammals was almost a matter of course, while that of the
remains of all others was the result of the exceptional and accidental
falling or conveyance of their bodies into the water after death, or of
their miring and dying in the slime of ponds and marshes. —

The greater part of the remarks which have just been made con-
cerning mammals is applicable to birds, and perhaps in some respects
with even greater force, for it is doubtful if so large a proportion of
formerly existing birds as of mammals have become represented by
fossilremains. Only asmall proportion of now existing birds habitually
live upon the water, and these, like all others, nest upon the land. The
remains of at least a portion of those which habitually resort to the
water are of course likely to become quickly intombed in its sediments,
while remains of all strictly land birds must reach such intombment,
if at all, by indirect or accidental means. Therefore, fossil remains
of aquatic birds are more likely to be discovered in sedimentary rocks
than are those of any others, although if is quite probable that the
terrestrial kinds as greatly preponderated over aquatic kinds in former
geological times as they now do.

While all reptiles are air-breathers many of them habitually live in
the water and in adjoining swamps and marshes. Many of this class,
however, are not only confined to the land, but some of them abound in
arid districts. The preservation of reptilian remains is, of course, sub-
ject to conditions similar to those under which mammalian and avian
remains are preserved, and it is therefore evident that while remains of
aquatic and palustral reptiles may readily find sedimentary or slimy
intombment those of strictly land reptiles are less likely to become thus
preserved. Itis doubtless in part for this reason that fossil remains of
representatives of now living upland reptiles are so rare as compared
with those of representatives of other living forms. Itis true that alarge
proportion of the great extinct subclass of Dinosauria were vegetable
feeders, as is shown by their skeletal structure and especially by the
character of their teeth, but most of those whose remains have been
discovered were probably of lowland or palustral rather than of upland
habitat. Their remains were therefore more likely to have undergone
intombment than were those of the upland reptiles which may have been
contemporary with them. That is, besides the usual methods in the
case of land animals, their remains were liable to intombment by miring
256 - REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

in the slime of marshes and shallow waters or by receiving a covering
of such sediments as river floods usually carry.

A few of the living Batrachia pass their whole lives in the water, but
the greater proportion of them are, in their adult state, air-breathing
palustral animals. A smaller proportion of them live upon dry land,
but these, like all the others, have aqueous respiration during their
larval condition. Besides this, as a rule, those which are strictly land
animals in their adult state seek the water at the breeding season.
Therefore, a larger proportion of batrachian remains are likely to find
palustral, than other sedimentary, intombment. The living Batrachia
do not constitute so conspicuous a class as do the other vertebrates,
and fossil batrachian remains are also comparatively rare, but among
-the reasons for this rarity is doubtless the fact that few of the class
inhabit the larger bodies of water, such as those in which the more im-
portant formations were deposited.

Beeause all fishes are of aquatic habitat the intombment of their
remains in the sediments of the waters in which they lived is more ¢
matter of course than it is in the case of any of the other vertebrates.
It is true, however, that fossil fish remains are, as a rule, less abundant
in the sedimentary formations than might be expected in view of the
comparative abundance of fishes in now existing waters. This is diffi-
eult to explain, even if it were now necessary to do so, butitis perhaps
due in part to the entire destruction of their bodies in many cases by
predatory enemies, in part to the large proportion of animal matter in
their bones, and in part to other destructive causes acting upon the
usually but not always fragile ichthyic skeleton. The absence of a
true skeleton in many fishes ought also to be taken into consideration
in this connection, extinct fishes of this kind being represented only, or
mainly, by teetl and spines.

- Mollusea.—The hard parts of mollusks, those which are preservable
by sedimentary intombment, consist mainly of lime carbonate with a
smaller proportion of animal matter than the hard parts of vertebrates
contain. They are sometimes internal; but these, strictly speaking, are
not skeletal in the sense that the bones of vertebrates are so. Usually
they form a protective shell which envelopes the whole, or the greater
part, of the animal. Much the greater proportion of the members of
this branch of the animal kingdom have aqueous respiration, and these
consequently live only in the water. The others are air-breathers and
live either upon the land or at the water’s edge. Many species and
genera and some whole families of both aquatic and land mollusks have
no hard parts, and their bodies are therefore immediately and com-
pletely decomposed after death, leaving no trace of their former exist-
ence. The hard parts of aquatic mollusks find speedy intombment
in the sediments at the bottom of the waters in which they lived, while
those of land mollusks are liable to complete atmospheric decomposi-
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 257

tion, or if thus intombed they must reach those sediments in the acei-
dental manner which has been described on preceding pages.

tis reasonable to assume that at least as great a proportion of ex-
tinet, as of living mollusks were destitute of protective shells, and
that as great a proportion were provided with oily internal or other
imperfect shelly parts. This having been the case it is plain that a
large part of formerly existing mollusks can have no representation
among fossil remains, and that a large proportion of the others must
have failed of such representation. Still, mollusks as a class are so
generally provided with a complete sheily protection for their bodies
that these objects are among the most abundant and valuable fossil
remains of which the geologist makes use in his investigations. Their
value is enhanced above that of the remains of any other class as a -
whole by the fact that so large proportion of them were denizens of
the waters in which were deposited the sedimentary formations which
are now characterized by them.

Annuloida.—The existence in former geological time of others of the
Annuloida than those which constitute the class Echinodermata has
never been satisfactorily proved by the discovery of their fossil remains,
but there seems to be no reason for doubt that some such animals really
existed during at least a portion of that time. If such were the case
their failure to be represented by fossil remains was doubtless due to
the absence or imperfection of hard or fossilizable portions of their
bodies. On the contrary, only a few of all the living Echinodermata are
destitute of protective hard parts, which generally consist of a nearly
or quite complete calcareous spinous test that under favorable condi-
tions preserves the form ofthe animal after death. Most of them are pro-
vided with certain small internal hard parts, but no true skeletal frame.

The abundance of discovered fossil remains of Echinodermata show
that the plan of their anatomical structure was essentially the same as
that of their living representatives. The living Echinodermata are
dwellers in marine waters, and it is presumable that the class has
always been confined to a marine habitat. In former geological ages
their representatives were abundant and varied, as is shown by their
often abundant calcareous remains which are found in many formations,
where they readily became intombed when those formations were in the
condition of sediments in the waters in which those Eehinodermata
lived.

Annulosa.—Ot the five classes constituting the Annulosa remains of
the Crustacea are more likely than those of the others to be preserved
by sedimentary intombment, because all the members of this class are
provided with a more or less firm chitinous or calcareous covering for
their bodies, and because with few and comparatively inconspicuous
exceptions they are all of aqueous respiration and aquatic habitat.
Being of aquatic habitat the Crustacea of former geological periods are

H. Mis, 114, pt, 2——17
258 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

likely to have become quite completely represented by fossil remains,
because their crustaceous coverings would have found ready intomb-
ment in the sediments of the waters in which they lived. It is never-
theless true that while crustacean remains are by no means rare in
paleozoic strata, in mesozoic and later formations remains of this class
have rarely or never been found abundant, and often they do not appear
among fossil faunas, the members of which would seem to have been
their natural associates. This is all the more noteworthy because of
the frequent molting of the mature shell by these animals, each indi-
vidual of which would thus produce many fossilizable counterparts of
itself.

The Myriapoda, Arachnida, and Insecta are so generally dwellers
upon the land, that, as a rule, their remains can reach sedimentary
intombment only by such accidental means as have been mentioned in
preceding paragraphs when referring to other land animals. ‘The pres-
ervation of such remains of these Annulosa, however, as may undergo
sedimentary intombment is favored by the fact that they are generally
provided with a covering of chitine, a substance which resists decom-
position more effectually than do most other hard parts of animals, not
excepting bones, teeth, and calcareous shells.

These three classes, especially the Insecta, are now represented by
myriads of mostly minute animals presenting the greatest diversity of
form and of habits of life. It cannot be doubted that at least the
Insecta were abundantly represented among the faunas of former geo-
logical periods, although fossil remains of them are comparatively rare.
This rarity is doubtless due to the fact already indicated that their
remains could have reached sedimentary intombment only by acciden-
tal means, and also in part to the fragile character of the chitinous coy-
ering of a large proportion of them. In short, it seems necessary to
conclude that comparatively little can ever be known concerning the
probably great abundance of Insect, Arachnid, and Myriapodal life of
former geological time.

Only the aquatie Annelida need be considered in this connection,
because no satisfactory remains of extinct representatives of the others
are likely to be found among any of the fossil faunas. ~ Even the aquatie
Annelida are of less importance as regards the subject of this essay
than are most of the other classes of animals, because, with the ex-
ception of the Tubicola, few of them possess such hard parts as
instructively represent their different forms after the death of the ani-
mal. It is true that some of these are provided with a mure or less
delicate chitinous covering which sometimes approximately preserves
the form of the animal after the decomposition of the soft parts, and
some of them also possess minute teeth. Traces of forms similar to
these are sometimes discovered in stratified rocks,as are also such
minute teeth as compare with those of some living annelids.

The living Tubicola, however, secrete an external shell, usually cal-
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 259

careous and much like that of the Gasteropoda, and such shells as these
in considerable variety are found among fossil faunas. Many aquatic
annelids burrow in the mud or sand at the bottom of the water in which
they live, and similar burrows are not unfrequently found in sediment-
ary strata, which were doubtless made by extinct annelid species.

Celenterata.—The Coelenterata consist of somewhat numerous orders
and families, all of which are aquatic animals and all except a few in-
conspicuous forms are denizens of saline waters. Therefore if all the
living members of this branch of the animal kingdom were possessed
of such hard parts as would resist decomposition after death, we would
be justified not only in inferring that the bodies of their extinct repre-
sentatives were similar in structure, but in assuming that all of them
have been more or less completely represented by fossil remains. A
large part of the living Coelenterata, however, are entirely destitute of
even the most delicate hard parts, while others secrete a more or less
massive calcareous or corneous skeleton, or sometimes an external
tube, such as the well-known corals, sea fans, ete. It is therefore
necessary to infer that while a very large proportion of the Ccelen-
terata which have existed during past geological time secreted coral-
line skeletons and tubes in infinite variety, another large proportion
have left no material proof of their existence. It is true that casts
and impressions in fine sedimentary strata of certain extinct forms of
jelly fishes have been discovered;* but this is a rare and remarkable
exception to the rule just referred to, the purport of which is that none
of the extinet animals whose bodies consisted only of soft parts could
have left any satisfactory evidence of their existence. Fossil corals
are often so well preserved that they may be as completely studied as
the now living forms, but still much of the structure of the extinct
polyps must forever remain unknown.

Protozoa.—All the Protozoa to which reference need be made in this
connection are of aquatic habitat, most of them living in marine waters.
These are the Foraminifera, Radiolaria, and Spongida, and only these
secrete such hard parts as resist decomposition. Their hard parts
are sometimes in the form of minute complex calcareous or siliceous
shells, sometimes of calcareous or siliceous masses, and they sometimes
consist of the well-known substance which constitutes sponges.

Much of protozoan life has no known connection with sach hard parts
as have just been mentioned, and it is presumable that the proportion of
protozoan forms which secrete no hard parts was similar in past geolog-
ical epochs to that which now obtains. If so, there must have been an
abundant representation of such life in the past of which no trace has

ogical epochs have been necessary to their fossilization, have already
been referred to, but it is desirable to consider to what extent remains
of extinct floras nay have been so preserved and fossilized.

The true aquatic plants or algve, except those belonging to the family
Corallinacee, are usually so succulent that they decompose almost as
quickly as do the soft parts of animals, and they are therefore repre-
sented in sediments only as casts or impressions. Although the diatoms
are represented by abundant remains in both marine and nonmarine
waters, comparatively little use has been made of them in the systematic
study of fossil remains.

With few and comparatively unimportant exceptions it is only such
plants as grow upon marshes which are subject to periodical overflow
and sedimentary accretion, and such portions of others as may be east
into adjacent waters by the winds or carried into them by river freshets,
that are likely to undergo such sedimentary intombment as would
insure their preservation in a condition for satisfactory study. No up-
land plants, except portions of those which grow in the neighborhood
of bodies of water, are likely to become so intombed, and herbaceous
plants, most of which wither and remain attached to their roots, as
well as the foliage of evergreen trees, are also not likely to be cast into
the water together with autumn leaves of deciduous trees. Again, the
fruits of deciduous trees, being usually more compact than their leaves,
are not likely to be transported by winds to a sedimentary burial.

It is therefore apparent that the representation by fossil remains of
every formerly existing flora is necessarily very incomplete, not only
because of the accidental character of even the most favorable condi-
tions for their preservation, but because a large, and apparently the
larger, part of every flora existed under conditions which rendered the
preservation of any portions of it impossible. Furthermore, the process
of intombment, as well as of being detached and conveyed to it, neces-
sarily reduced every plant so preserved to a fragmentary condition,
and breaking up the rocks in which they are now found they are una-
voidably still further injured and often destroyed by even the most
careful collector.

The incompleteness of representation of extinct animals and plants
by fossil remains when they are considered with reference to the entire
bodies of living animals and plants has already been referred to. It
has also been shown that a large proportion of the animals whieh lived
in the various geological epochs could have left no recognizable trace
of their existence because of the perishable nature of all parts of their
bodies. From these and other facts which have been stated the conclu-
sion is necessary that a very large proportion of those extinct animals
and plants which possessed fossilizable parts have never been repre-
sented by fossil remains, because those parts, not having fallen under
conditions favorable to their preservation, have been as completely
decomposed and destroyed as have the soft parts of the same bodies,
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 261

Besides the facts already indicated the following have special signifi-
cance in this connection. All fossil remains are more or less imperfect
as such beeause of the destructive natural conditions to which they
inevitably have been subjected, and the firm consolidation of most of
the rocks containing them has rendered impossible the recovery of the
greater part of those which have really been preserved. The successive
displacements which have taken place in the crust of the earth have so
exposed the sedimentary formations to erosion that during the succes-
sive epochs large portions of all of them have been destroyed, together
with their fossil contents, thus reducing the paleontological record to
that extent. Other large portions of those formations have been so
completely covered by succeeding deposits, by debris resulting from
their erosion, and by the waters of present lakes and seas that they are
inaccessible for study, and the available paleontological record has been
thereby still further reduced.

An additional reduction has doubtless been accomplished by meta-
morphism—that is, in view of many important facts, both physical and
biological, it is not unreasonable to conclude that the various series of
pre-Cambrian stratified formations which are found in different parts of
the world were once fossiliferous, and that the fossils they then con-
tained have been destroyed as such by the metamorphic action which
changed the mineral character of the strata.

If fossils were to be treated only as mere tokens of the respective
formations in which they are found, their biological classification would
be a matter of little consequence, but their broad significance in his-
torical geology as well as in systematic biology renders it necessary that
they should be classified as nearly as possible in the same manner that
living animals and plants are classified. Considering the imperfection
of all fossil remains, the question arises, Can they be classified upon the
same general plans and by the same systematic methods that are used
for living animals and plants? The answer is mainly in the affirmative,
because structural characteristics are possessed by the fossilizable parts
of animals and plants which are cognate, coincident, and of a similar
classificatory character with those of the untossilizable parts, although
the latter, being more complete and convenient, are mainly relied upon
in the classification of living forms.

As regards the classification of animal fossil remains, precisely the
same system is available that is used for living animals, the former
classification being in fact only an extension of the latter. In the
former case, however, the methods and details depend more fully than
in the latter upon the well established principles of comparative anat-
omy, because the direct and complete anatomical study of fossil animals
is for obvious reasons impracticable. Indeed, it is upon comparative
anatomy that most of the real scientific value of fossils depends, and
without its aid they would always remain little more than mere curios-

ities or arbitrary.tokens of the formations, in which they are found.
With the aid of comparative anatomy and systematic taxonomy these
fossils, notwithstanding their imperfection and faunal incompleteness,
become not only indispensable in geological investigations, but real rep-
resentatives of the grand succession of animai life that has existed upon
the earth.

In the case of fossil Vertebrata it is the skeleton and teeth almost
alone that are used in classification, but so distinctly were the classifi-
catory characteristics of those animals impressed upon the hard parts
of their bodies that the nearly or quite complete structure of the whole
animal may legitimately be inferred from them. Furthermore, these
characteristics are so distinctly impressed upon the teeth and upon cer-
tain essential parts of the skeleton that legitimate classification of
extinet forms can often be established upon no more than a few scat-
tered teeth or fragmentary portions of the skeleton.

The extinet Mollusea, as has already been shown, are represented by
their fossil shells, and these are classified precisely as are the shells of
living members of that class.* Moreover, the classification of the fossil
mollusean forms accords more completely with that of the living than is
the case with the Vertebrata because living mollusks are largely classi-
tied by their shells alone, even when the soft parts of the animal are
available.

As in the case of the Mollusea the fossil Echinodermata are classified
in the same manner and by the same means as are the living forms,
because the classification of the latter is based mainly upon those which
in the extinct forms become fossilized.

The method of classification of all the fossil Annulosa is essentially
the same as that which is used for the living forms, the difference, if
any, being mainly due to the usual incompleteness of the fossil speci-
mens. In such cases, as well as in those of the greater part of other
fossil remains, more attention is given to certain characteristics of the
hard parts than is found necessary when the whole animal is available
for study.

While the classification of those living Ceelenterata which have no
hard parts is necessarily based wholly upon the structure of their soft
bodies, that of those living forms which possess skeletal or protective
parts is largely based upon them. In this latter respect the extinct
Coelenterata are classified in the same manner as are their living rep-
resentatives, namely, by means of their coralline hard parts.

Because the soft bodies of the living Protozoa are so nearly struc-
tureless that they can not furnish a satisfactory basis for classification
it is necessarily based upon the structure and character of the hard
parts in the case of those which secrete them. Therefore the classifica-

*The elaborate classification of the fossil cephalopods by means of their septal
flexures may be taken as an exception to this statement.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION 2635

tion of the fossil Protozoa has precisely the same basis as has that of
the living forms.

The classification of fossil plants is, in a general way, similar to that
of living plants, and so far as the recognition of the great classes and
subclasses is concerned it is the same—that is, each of these higher
divisions of the vegetable kingdom is recognizable among fossil-plant
remains by its peculiar histological structure and the characteristic
plan of its foliage venation; but the method of discrimination of species
and genera of fossil plants is wholly different from that which is em-
ployed in the study of living plants, the latter method being impractica-
ble because of the imperfection of the fossil material. In the case of
living plants the detailed structure of the flower and fruit together
with the general structure of the whole plant forms the basis of classi-
fication. ‘In the case of fossil plants, however, classification is based
almost wholly upon foliage, the main reliance for the discrimination of
species being upon the venation of leaves the imprints of which are
found upon the riven surfaces of stratified rocks, while their form or
marginal outline is the principal reliance for the discrimination of
genera. Other data are sometimes-used for classification, such as the
general form of the plant so far as it may be determinable, the micro-
scopic woody structure, etc.; but these are rarely available and are
generally less satisfactory than are those which are furnished by foliage.

In presenting the foregoing statements concerning the character of
fossil remains I have taken occasion to indicate their high biological
value not only when considered as fossils, but even in comparison with
living forms as a standard, especially when studies and comparisons of
them are made with reference to the principles of comparative anatomy ;
and I have also asserted their paramount value in geological investiga-
tions. Still, 1 have not hesitated to call attention to their imperfection
and their faunal and floral incompleteness—that is, [ have thought it
necessary to indicate how incompletely any of the faunas and floras
which have formerly existed upon the earth are, or can be, represented
by them, and also how imperfect, even as fossils, are a majority of the
specimens which reach the geologist’s hands. My object in doing this
is to show that the boundaries of possible knowledge with reference to
the life which has formerly existed upon the earth lie within the limit
which some authors have seemed disposed to assign to it, and in the
same connection I have called attention to certain other facts wheh in-
dicate that at least portions of the knowledge which is legitimately at-
tainable may be overestimated or misapplied.

This treatment of the subject would be unfair if it were not accom-
panied by statements of facts and principles showing the paramount
importance of fossil remains in the prosecution of geological investi-
gation. Suchashowing will be made in the following essays, and in the
same connection the true value and teaching of fossils will also be dis-
cussed.

Y64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

The following explanation of the different conditions in which fossil
remains are found will supplement the preceding discussions and add
to the description of their character which has already been given.

There are seven different natural conditions in which fossil remains
are recognizable, three of which relate to substance, three to form, and
one to both. To those relating to substance I have applied the terms
permineralization, histometabasis, and carbonization: to those relating
to form, the terms molds, imprints, and casts; and to the one relating
to both form and substance, the term pseudomorphism.

The term permineralization applies to that condition of fossil remains
of animals which differs least from their original condition as parts of
living animals, such, for example, as bones of vertebrates, shells of
mollusks, tests of crustaceans, ete. It is in this condition that the
greater part of all fossil remains are found. In their original condition
they were all composed of both mineral and animal matter. Mineral
matter greatly preponderated in allof them, but the proportions differed
much in the case of different branches of the animal kingdom. For
example, the proportion of animal matter is much greater in bones,
even in their‘ most solid portions, than in shells of mollusks or tests of
most crustaceans. In all cases, however, the proportion of mineral mat-
ter was sufficient to perfectly preserve the original form ot each specimen
during the process of fossilization. Their only material change in this
process was the removal by decomposition of the animal matter and
its replacement by mineral matter, the latter having been added as a
precipitate from its solution in the waters in which the fossilization
took place. This baving been continued until all the minute inter-
stices originally occupied by the animal matter were filled, the fossils
became wholly mineralized and as indestructible as are other minerals
of like compesition. Indestructibility of these fully mineralized fos-
sils, however, is not in all cases absolute, as will appear by remarks in
following paragraphs.

The term histometabasis* is applied to that condition of fossilization
in which an entire exchange of the original substance for another has
occurred in such a manner as to retain or reproduce the minute and
even the microscopic texture of the original. It is especially applicable
to silicified wood. In such eases of fossilization the exchange has
been made by destructive decomposition, molecule by molecule, of the
woody tissues and their immediate replacement by precipitated mole-
cwes of the silex held in solution in the water in which the wood was
immersed. By this remarkable process not only the original cell strue-
ture of various kinds of wood but the characteristic cell markings of
each kind are often found to have been so perfectly preserved in the
solid agate-like mass that it may be as completely studied as if the
specimens were taken from living trees.

RELATION OF BIOLOGY.'TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 265

Pseudomorphism of fossils is so nearly like that of mineral crystals
that this term is equally applicable to both. It consists in the replace-
ment of the original substance of the fossil by a erystallizable or erys-
tallized mineral, such, for example, as calcite, pyrite, quartz in the form
of chalcedony, etc., the original form of the fossil being perfectly retained.
It is evident that at least a part of the crystallized pseudomorphs
were formed by the precipitation of the component mineral from its
solution within such cavities as are described as molds in another
paragraph. In such cases they differ from casts as described on the
next page only in being crystallized, but crystallization is one of the dis-
tinguishing characteristics of pseudomorphs. In many cases pseu-
domorphs were evidently formed by molecular replacement. All those
chalcedonic pseudomorphs of shells which sometimes occur in lime-
stone, and from which they often may be freed in a complete condition
by acids, have doubtless been produced by molecular replacement.

The term carbonization is applied in this connection only or mainly
to such masses of vegetal remains as coal, lignite, and peat. While
such remains are of great economic value and often of great importance
in structural geology, they are of little paleontological importance, be-
cause the organic structure of the plants from which they were de-
rived has been so completely obliterated as to render them useless for
such a purpose. Occasionally, however, fruits and other separate
parts of plants are found to have acquired a carbonized condition in
which their botanical character may be approximately determined.

Molds are cavities in sedimentary rocks which were originally ocecu-
pied by fossils, the latter having been subsequently removed by the
percolation of water containing a solvent of the fossils but not of the
rock. Such solvents, while completely removing certain kinds of fos-
sils sometimes left others unaffected, and sometimes they acted un-
equally upon fossils of essentially the same chemical composition. For
example, the shells of the Ostreide almost always have resisted such
solvents more than have most other shells. The original surface features
and markings of fossils are often minutely preserved in molds, but
they are frequently obscured in different ways; for example, by com-
pression of the mold after it was formed, or by its having received a
drusy lining.

Imprints do not ditfer materially in character from molds, the former
term being usually applied to impressions left in the rock by thin sub-
stances like leaves of plants, wings of insects, ete., after their removal
by decomposition. Sometimes, however, the molds of shells and other
fossils have been reduced to the character of imprints by the extreme
pressure to which the strata containing them have been subjected. The
details of imprints have often been obscured by pressure, as in the case
of molds, but they are often preserved with the greatest degree of
minuteness.
266°. REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Casts are counterparts of fossils, having been produced by the filling
of molds with a substance other than that of the original fossil. It
may have been by the injection, caused by pressure or otherwise, of
substance derived from the matrix or inelosing rock, or by the precipi-
tation of substances brought into the cavity suspended in percolating
water. If in the latter case the cast is composed of a crystallized
mineral, the term pseudomorph is applied to it, as already stated.
Natural stony casts of the interior of shells and other fossils are often
found within the molds which were formed by the solution and re-
moval of the fossil itself, and they are also often found filling permineral-
ized shells. The student of fossils often finds it desirable to take ar-
tificial casts of natural molds, especially in case he can obtain no other
representation of the species he desires to study. By such a cast the
original form and surface features are often reproduced with the great-
est accuracy.

In the foregoing paragraphs are described the principal conditions
in which fossils occur or by which they are represented, but one occa-
sionally finds specimens which indicate certain conditions that are not
fully recognized in the foregoing descriptions.

These cases, however, are less important than are those which have
been considered, and they need not be further mentioned, but it is
desirable to refer to certain conditions under which the soft parts of
animals have sometimes been represented by impressions in sedimentary
rocks, or under which they have been preserved from ordinary decay
for an unusual length of time.

The fact was referred to on page 252, that although the soft parts of
animals could never have become really fossilized, cases have occurred
of the preservation in fine sediments of their form and even parts of
their structure, in the condition of imprints or casts. A most remark-
able and exceptional case of this kind is that of the jelly-fishes of the
Jurassic slates of Solenhofen, where, in the fine sediments of which the
slates were originally composed, not only their shape but the essential
parts of their structure are preserved. Impressions, presumably of
similar animals, have been found in older rocks, but these are less per-
fect than the Solenhofen specimens.

Fossilization or petrefaction of human bodies is often popularly re-
ported to have occurred, but these are only cases of the change of the
adipose and muscular tissues of the body to the wax-like substance
adipocere, which process only delays but does not prevent final and
complete decomposition. This change frequently occurs in other ani-
mal bodies that have become buried in wet or constantly damp earth,
and packages of pork recovered from old river wrecks have often been
found to have undergone the same change.

Every specimen of fossilized man is really only a skeleton, but the
wonderful cases of preservation of the human form in the partially
hardened volcanic ash of Pompeii are worthy of mention in this con-
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 267

nection as illustrating more than one of the facts that have been stated
in the foregoing paragraphs. While excavating the buried city the
workmen came upon molds of the bodies of persons who were suffo-
cated by, and buried beneath, the shower of ashes from Vesuvius.
The body, even including the bones, long ago decomposed and was
removed by the percolation of water which fell from the clouds. Casts
of these molds, when discovered, were made by pouring them full of
plaster, and when the comparatively soft inclosing matrix was removed
an exact counterpart of the body was disclosed just as it fell in death
well nigh two thousand years ago.

II. SEDIMENTARY FORMATIONS, THEIR CHARACTER AND LIMITATION.

It is apparent from statements made in the preceding essay that, as
arule, to which there are no geologically important exceptions, fossils
have been preserved only in those accumulations of aqueous sediments
which are now known as the sedimentary or stratified rocks of the
earth, and that it is therefore these rocks only which furnish biological
data for geological investigation. Furthermore, it is upon the general
classification of these rocks, based upon both their physical and -bio-
logical characteristies, that the whole system of historical geology
depends, and it is their fossil contents that furnish the most efficient
aid in the study of structural geology. The following essay will be
devoted to discussions of these subjects, and it is therefore desirable
first to present some remarks upon the stratified rocks with reference
to the origin and limitation of the formations into which they are natu-
rally divided. These remarks will necessarily include both the physi-
cal and paleontological definition of formations, and a reference to
their use as units of stratigraphic classification.

There has been much difference of custom among geologists as re-
gards the use of the term formation, some applying it to the smallest
assemblages of strata which possess common characteristics, while
others designate by the same term those series of formations to which
the term system has been generally applied. That is, some apply
the term formation to local or limited developments of strata, while
others apply it to such systems as the Devonian, Carboniferous, Cre-
taceous, ete. This term has generally been confined to the stratified
rocks, but by a few authors it has been applied to the eruptive, and
also to the great crystalline rock masses. In these essays, however,
the use of the term formation is not only confined to the stratified rocks,
but it is restricted to those assemblages of strata which have common
distinguishing characteristics, whether they have little or great geo-
graphical extent, or whether they aggregate a few feet or thousands of
feet in thickness. That is, the use of the term is herein confined to.
those assemblages of stratified rocks of sedimentary origin* to which
many authors have applied the term group, and others the term ter-
raine.

A formation of this kind consists of an assemblage of strata which
bears evidence of having been deposited by continuous sedimentation
in a broad body of water, the sediments in different formations and

*To avoid frequent repetition, the terms sedimentary formation and stratified for-
mation are used interchangeably when applied to formations as defined in this essay.
The terms sedimentary rocks, stratified rocks, and fossiliferous rocks are also used
interchangeably, but with a somewhat more general meaning than is intended by
the two former terms.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 269

sometimes in different parts of the same formation having varied in
condition from that of impalpable fineness to that of sand and gravel.
They are composed of calcareous, argillaceous, or siliceous materials
which in process of time have become more or less completely hardened
into rock and which in their separate condition are limestones, sand-
stones, and shales, respectively. These materials may, and often do,
occur thus separately, not only in different formations, but in different
parts of the same formation. Besides this, the different materials are
often mechanically commingled, producing rocks of a mixed character ;
and sometimes the character of all kinds of stratified rocks is found to
have been materially changed by metamorphism.

Formations differ greatly in thickness because the rate of aceumu-
lation of sediments was necessarily very variable and because their
upper and lower limitation was coincident with, and due to, accidental
changes of physical conditions which occurred at irregular intervals of
time. That is, their limitation was caused by such movements of the
earth’s crust, including both land and sea bottom, as produced a more
or less complete interruption of sedimentation, or change in the char-
acter of the same, and consequently a more or less complete extinction,
or geographical transference, of the life that existed in the water in
which the sediments were deposited. This is an almost invariable rule,
but in rare cases the faunal and physical delimitations were not fully
coincident. In such eases an abrupt faunal change has occurred within
the vertical range, or at the upper limit, of a formation where sedimen-
tation seems to have been unbroken between it and the next succeed-
ing one. Such cases plainly resulted from a change in the character of
the water as a faunal habitat, which was not accompanied by a corre-
sponding arrest of, or even by a material change in, the character of
the sedimentation.*

Formations may sometimes be continuously traced by the eye for
considerable distances, especially if the débris of erosion has been well
removed by denudation. In such cases no question can be raised as to
their identity. Sometimes also a formation may be satisfactorily ree-
ognized at separate but not distant localities by means of its litholog-
ical characteristics alone when actual continuity is obscured or hidden
from view by succeeding formations or other overlying material. In
their greater geographical extension, however, formations undergo such
changes of lithological character, and they often so closely simulate
some one or more associated formations, that their lithological identifi-
cation is uncertain or impracticable. Therefore, with the minor excep-
tions mentioned, the only known means by which a formation may be
certainly identified at any other than its originally discovered lccality
is that which is afforded by its contained fossil remains.

*Reference is here made particularly to conditions that are observable among the
Upper Cretaceous formations of the interior portion of North America,
270 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

3ecause of the frequent displacements of portions of the earth crust
which have occurred during geological time, and also because of the
resulting great erosion of the materials of which formations are com-
posed, none of them now exists in its original entirety, but it is desirable
to consider them with reference to their origin as well as to their pres-
ent condition, the better to understand their character.

Every formation originally consisted of sediments, which, within a
portion of geological time of limited but uncertain duration, were de-
posited in any broad body of water, whether inland or marine, during
all of which time both the body of water and the surrounding or ad-
jacent land remained comparatively unaffected by displacements of the
earth’s crust or by any other adverse physical changes. Under favor-
able conditions every such body of water was the congenial habitat of
aquatic animals, remains of which became fossilized in the constantly
accumulating sediments. These animals constituted more or less dis-
tinct faunas, the geographical range of each of which was, in the case
of inland waters, throughout the whole area occupied by each, and in
the case of oceanic waters, throughout each of such large portions as
were circumscribed by natural intramarine limits to faunal distribu-
tion, these limits having been in a general way barriers between
faunal areas, although they were never sharply defined and were
usually indefinite.

Within these more or less indefinite intramarine barriers the various
forms of aquatic life constituted a separately recognizable fauna, and
the sedimentary deposits became a separately recognizable formation.
Still, those barriers are properly designated as indefinite because it is
evident that the sedimentary deposits of any one of those ancient
oceanic areas always blended to a greater or less degree with those of
adjacent areas, and that certain members of every fauna ranged into
adjacent faunal areas, just as certain species of every living marine
fauna have a much wider geographical range than have most of their
associates.

Much the greater part of the sedimentary formations of the earth
were deposited in marine waters, as is shown by the character of
their contained fossils, and most of those waters were then, as now, of
oceanic extent. The character of the contained fossils of a compara-
tively small but important part of the sedimentary formations, how-
ever, Show that they were deposited in inland bodies of water, some of
which were fresh and some brackish. Some of those inland bodies of
water were comparatively small, but others were of such extent that
their deposits rival marine formations in that respect.

Every formation resulting from deposits in inland waters hay-
ing had practically the same geographical extent as the body of water
in which it was deposited, the original boundary of the whole forma.
tion was coincident with the shore line, but this can not be assumed
with regard to the formations which were deposited in waters of
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 271

oceanic extent. These, like existing marine waters, notwithstanding
their extensive continental and island shore lines, which became in
part original limits to formations, had world-wide continuity, but it
is evident to every geologist that the most extensive of the marine
formations in their separate physical and biological identity have
rarely exceeded a few hundred miles in extent, and they are often
much less. The variable physical limits to the areas of sedimentation
within which were produced the separately recognizable formations
were coincident with the indefinite intra-marine faunal barriers just
mentioned, and all marine formations more or less completely merged
both their physical and faunal identity into that of those which were de-
posited in adjacent waters. It is to be inferred that climatic influences,
or rather those of temperature, had much to do with faunal limitation,
but temperature was doubtless in large part equalized by the currents
which conveyed the sediments that produced the formations.

The geographical definition of marine sedimentary and faunal areas,
and consequently that of the resulting formations, was mainly or wholly
due to the various and shifting conditions of land and sea bottom,
which in different parts of the world and dtring successive geological
epochs modified or changed the distribution of sediments within the
great areas into which the oceanic waters were thus divided, and it was
generally accomplished without affecting the aqueous continuity
between them. In a large proportion of cases these shifting conditions
did not affect the continuity of those waters, and they were sometimes
so slight as to leave the resulting formation with illy defined upper and
lower limitations, as well as with their usual indefinite: geographical
boundaries. They were often so great, however, as to elevate and long
retain the former ocean bottom above the water level, and to thus pro-
duce a greater or less unconformity of, or a longer or shorter time hiatus
between formations.

While shifting conditions of sea bottom constituted the principal
factor in limiting areas of sedimentation, they soinetimes caused the
partial overlapping of the borders of contemporary formations by
having alternateiy shifted those of adjacent sedimentary areas, thus
adding to the usual indefiniteness of such boundaries. :

The upper and lower limits of formations weve sometimes produced
by the elevation of sea bottom above water level and its resubmergence,
in which case those limits were sharply defined. In other cases the
movements of elevation and depression were too slight to entirely
interrupt sedimentation, and those or other physical changes were too
slight to prevent the survival of certain members of the earlier fauna
as members of the later one. Indeed, it is through such survivals that
continuity of life has been preserved during the whole range of geo-
logical time. In such cases the physical difference between the forma-
tions is usually slight. This, added to the partial commingling of their
faunas, sometimes renders it difficult to fix upon a dividing line between

/
PTD! REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

them, and makes it especially necessary in determining the character-
istics of each formation to study their respective faunas each as a whole.
Still, it is usually the case that the vertical range of a large proportion
of the species is not found to pass beyond the vertical limits of the for-
mation in which they occur.

The beginning and ending of the sedimentation which produced each
formation having been dependent upon the unstable conditions of the
earth’s crust, the occurrence of the displacements of which were irreg-
ular in time and variable in extent, formations are necessarily not only
very unequal as regards their geographical extension, but also as
regards their relative value in stratigraphical classification. For these,
among other causes, they are also unequal in their relative importance
as representing stages in biological development.

The foregoing remarks apply especially to marine formations, and
they are of general applicability. The manner, however, in which
oceurred the upper and lower delimitation of the series of fresh water
formations in the interior region of North America was evidently some-
whatexceptional. These deposits took place in waters which rested above
ocean level, and their differentiation into formations was evidently
largely due to the shifting level of the waters in which they were
respectively laid down, as well as to the shifting of the areas of denu-
dation from which their sediments were derived. The latter was doubt-
less also the cause of the differences in lithological charactisties of
those formations,

Because both the time and areal limits of marine faunas were always
indefinite, especially as regards both the time and geographical range
of certain species, it is plain that it is the fauna as a whole, and not
separate members of it, that must be regarded as characterizing a
formation, although a single species is often sufficient for its identifica-
tion within a limited district or region after its characterization has
been determined by means of its fauna, aided by its physical features.

The remains of aquatic faunas only have been considered in connec-
tion with the foregoing discussions of the origin and limitation of the
sedimentary formations, because the life history of those faunas only
was intimately connected with their production. The greater part of
the fossiliferous formations of the earth contain no other remains than
those of aquatic faunas, but in many formations remains of members
of contemporary land faunas and floras are found commingled with
those of aquatic faunas. The latter were intombed where they origi-
nated, but the others reached their intombment by the indirect way that

yas described in the preceding essay. It is therefore plain that the
remains of denizens of the waters in which a given formation was de-
posited are more characteristic of it than those of contemporaneous land
animals and plants could be, because the aquatic fauna which they rep-
resent, Whatever may be its value as representing a stage of biological
development, was dependent for its existence upon the same conditions
which were necessary to the production of the formation,

It is true that fossil remains of certain species of land animals and
plants may be, and often are, found only within the limits of a certain
formation. In that respect they may be regarded aS among its char-
acteristic fossils, but the time range of a land fauna or flora is likely
to have fallen short of, or to have exeeeded that of an aquatic fauna
whose own duration is known to have been at least in part contempo-
raneous, because the physical conditions which were the principal fac-
tors in establishing and extinguishing an aquatic fauna would not nec-
essarily have materially affected the existence of adjacent and contem-
poraneous land faunas and floras. These questions, however, will be
more fully referred to in following essays.

The foregoing remarks concerning the characterization of formations
have been made with special reference to those which are more or less
fossiliferous. It sometimes happens, however, that fossils do not exist,
or are not discovered, in certain formations which are evidently of sed-
imentary origin. This may have been due in some cases to the uncon-
geniality as a faunal habitat of the waters in which the formation was
deposited, and in others to their failure to receive any fossilizable re-
mains of animals and plants from the land. In other cases the absence
of fossils may have been due to their destruction or obliteration. The
latter has probably been the case with many metamorphic rocks and
with the great pre-Cambrian series of stratified rocks generally. In
all these cases the formations, while they may possess more or less dis-
tinct physical characteristics, lack the chief characteristics of sedi-
mentary formations, namely, the biological.

The occurrence of an unfossiliferous sedimentary formation as a
member of an otherwise fossiliferous series is unusual, but in such a
case its definition and limitation would be effectually accomplished
by the underlying and overlying formations. In the case, however,
of a great unfossiliferous series of stratified rocks like the pre-Cam
brian it is necessary to adopt a method for their study and classifi-
sation based wholly upon physical data, after the fact that they
are pre-Cambrian has been determined from biological data. Such a
method of classifying and characterizing those unfossiliferous stratified
rocks as they occur in North America has been proposed by Prof. R.
D. Irving* and afterward elaborated by others. This great series of
rocks as it is developed on this continent has such distinguishing gen-
eral characteristics and such magnitude and geographical extent that
some geologists have thought it worthy of being assigned to a special
division of study, but because no certain traces of organic forms have
been discovered in them they have, so far as itis now known, only the
indirect relation to biological geology that has just been referred to.
Still I regard it as not improbable that those strata were once fos-

siliferous and that the great series was once made up of formations
similar to those which have been defined on preceding pages, but it
does not necessarily follow that the divisions which are now recogniz-
able by physical characteristics correspond to those formations, It is
probable that they more nearly correspond to systems or to the larger
divisions of systems as they are recognized in the great scale of the
fossiliferous rocks of the earth. Therefore the discussion of formations
in this essay does not necessarily apply to the pre-Cambrian stratified
rocks,

The following conclusions concerning formations are deducible from
the facts which are stated in the foregoing paragraphs:

While they are physical objects and have only a physical existence
their proper characterization is chiefly biological.

They are characterizable mainly by the fossil remains of aquatic
faunas.

Neither their physical nor biological limits are sharply defined except
as a result of accidental causes.

Their geographical limitations are indefinite except those which
were occasioned by shore lines.

They do not necessarily bear any close relation to one another as to
geographical area, thickness, or the duration of tithe in their accumnu-
lation.

Although they are thus unequal to one another they constitute the
only available physical units for local or regional stratigraphic classi-
fication.

Because of their limited geographical extent they can not be used as
units of the universal classification of the stratified rocks.

HI.—THE RELATION OF FOSSIL REMAINS TO STRUCTURAL GEOLOGY.

The character and origin of fossil remains and the character and
limitation of the sedimentary formations, as well as the manner in
which the latter originated and became fossiliferous, have been dis-
cussed in the preceding essays. It is necessary that such discussions
should have preceded those which are embraced in this and following
essays, because they contain numerous statements of faet which it
will be constantly necessary to refer to or to bear in mind in connection
with the subjects now to be discussed and without which those sub-
jects could not be intelligibly presented.

There are two methods by which the study of fossils may legitimately
be applied to geological investigation, the following statement of the
character of which is in part explanatory of the results that may be
obtained by their aid. For convenience one of them may be termed
empirical and the other philosophical, because in the one case results
are obtained by experience and in the other by reasoning upon the
various results thus obtained. Still, discrimination between these two
methods can not usually be sharply drawn, because while all geological
investigation is largely empirical it is always more or less philosophical.
Such a division of the subject, however, besides being a present con-
venience, gives me an opportunity to emphasize the fact that a large
proportion of the work that is done in structural geology is based
mainly upon the empirical observation and collection of biological data.

Both these methods are not only important but indispensable, the
one not less so than the other. Both may be, and often are, used
together, but the empirical method is more largely used in practical
field studies than in others, because in such studies fossils’ are to a
large extent treated as characteristic tokens of formations or as arbi-
trary means of identifying them and distinguishing them from one
another. Such identification necessarily constitutes one of the first
steps in the practical study of structural geology, but the subsequent
study of the fossils thus empirically used is necessarily more philo-
sophical.

Furthermore, in the prosecution of field studies it is often necessary
to make special philosophical use of fossils, not only with reference to
questions which are discussed in following essays, but to some of
those which relate more particularly to the subject of this. Among
such questions are those which relate to the conditions of origin of
formations, the character and quality of the waters in which they were
deposited, and the various conditions of habitat of the faunas and
floras whose remains characterize them.

The philosophical method of treating fossil remains, however, is
largely applicable to systematic geology or those branches which per-
276 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

tain to the universal chronological classification of the sedimentary
formations and to their correlation in different parts of the world. The
naturalist studies fossil remains as representatives of the long succes-
sion of progressively and differentially developed organic forms which
during geological time have existed and become extinct and of which
succession the now existing forms of life constitute only the terminal
portion. It is the results of such studies as these that the geologist
uses in the philosophical studies referred to. While these questions
are discussed in following essays this one is devoted more especially
to questions pertaining to the practical study of geology in the field.

The idea of using fossils as characteristic tokens of formations by
means of which they may be distinguished from one another and iden-
tified in their geographical extension began to prevail with the earliest
studies of structural geology. Originally they were apparently re-
garded as of little or no more value in the identification of formations
than was their lithological composition, to which, indeed, their use
seems at first to have been merely auxiliary. Although the use of
fossils soon came to be recognized as indispensable in the characteriza-
tion and identification of formations, and their investigation came to
constitute a leading feature in geological research, it was long before
they began to be studied in a philosophical rather than in an empirical
manner.

That increase in their philosophical use did not diminish their value
in other respects, as is apparent from the fact that a large propor-
tion of the practical field work of to-day is necessarily based upon the
empirical use of fossils as tokens of formations. That is, a large propor-
tion of all the field work in structural geology depends upon the specific
identification of fossil remains with, necessarily, only incidental refer-
ence to their systematic biological classification, and with no necessry
reference to their value in other respects. Therefore the empirical use
of fossils is even now held to terms as simple as those which were em-
ployed by the early geologists. Although it is essential that geological
observations of all kinds should always be made with reference to all
related physical as well as biological facts which may be available, it is
not to be expected or desired that this primitive empirical use of
fossil remains will ever be either discarded or diminished,

The foregoing remarks are made in defense of even the simple use of
fossils just indicated, because it is evident that their value in that re-
spect, as well as in others, is often underestimated, even by some
geologists. The full measure of their usefulness, however, even in the
identification and characterization of formations, can be attained only
by a thorough investigation of comprehensive collections, prosecuted
with direct reference to, and a rational interpretation of, the biological
laws that governed the existence of the respective faunas and floras
which they represent, and with equally direct reference to the physical
laws which governed the production of the formations which they
characterize.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 277

It was shown inthe preceding essay that although formations as they
are there defined are not, and cannot be, the units of a universal classi-
fication of the stratified rocks they are the true units of local or regional
classification of those rocks, and their use as such is indispensable
in field studies of structural geology. Therefore the accurate identifi-
‘ation of formations is indispensable, and because of this the means of
correctly identifying them is of prime importance. It is true, as
already stated, that formations have really only a physical existence,
but their biological characteristics become in fact a part of their iden-
tity, and these characteristics constitute the principal, and in most cases
the only criteria of identification. The criteria of identification of for-
mations will be specially discussed in Essay v1, but it is necessary to
consider them briefly in this connection.

Of the two ways in which formations are naturally charaterizable
one is physical and the other biological. Physical characterization
may be direct or general, that is, it may be by identity of kind or kinds
of rock of which the formation is composed or by its possession of
that more general or indefinite property or condition which indicates
homogeny.

The physical or, more specially, the lithological, characteristics of any
given formation may be so different from those of an underlying or
overlying one that the contrast may be an efficient aid in its identifi-
cation, but this is too seldom the case to be generally relied upon, the
physical difference between them being usually no greater than that
which may oceur between different parts of one and the same forma-
tion in its geographical extension. Again the physical identification
of an unfossiliferous formation may sometimes be satisfactorily deter-
mined from its position with relation to overlying or underlying forma-
tions whose biological characteristics are known, but such methods
are usually too indefinite to meet the requirements of practical field
studies.

It is true that in certain regions where erosion, corrasion, and denu-
dation have been especially active, the field geologist may trace forma-
tions continuously and completely for many miles by means of their
lithological and other physical characteristics and without the aid of
fossils, but usually they have become so obscured by the overlapping of
one upon another, or by being overlain by glacial or other drift or the
débris resulting from their own erosion, that they are exposed to view
only at wide intervals, and then incompletely. It is also true, that as
a result of a long series of observations at such limited exposures of
formations as those just referred to, one may obtain an approximately
clear idea of the identity of a formation from the physical evidence
which it presents of its homogenesis. Although in late years it has
become the custom of some geologists in seeking to identify formations
to rely upon these indications to the exclusion of others, a careful con
sideration of all available relevant facts will make it plain that the
ya Re) REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

principal value of these indications Consists in their availability as
accessories to biological evidence. These physical indications of the
identity of formations are further discussed in Essay vi. They are
mentioned here only for the purpose of comparing them with biological
indications.

Formations are biologically characterized only by the fossil remains
of animals and plants which lived while they were in process of depo-
sition, and the more intimate the natural relation of any of those
animals and plants to the physical conditions which produced a forma-
tion, the more characteristic of it are their remains. This implies that
while no kind of fossil remains is to be rejected in practical studies of
structural geology, there is much difference in the value of the different
kinds for this purpose. These differences in value will be specially
discussed in following essays.

In the preceding essay it was shown that there was an intimate
relation between the geographical boundaries of each aqueous area
within which the sedimentation took place that resulted in the produc-
tion of a formation and those of the habitat of the aquatic fauna the
remains of which are now found to characterize it. Also that each
aquatic fauna began its existence as such with the beginning of the
deposition of the formation and ended its faunal existence with the
completion of that deposition, although, as a rule there was some ge-
netic connection with both the preceding and succeeding faunas.
Again it was shown that the conditions which attended the establish-
ment of those boundaries and controlled the deposition of the sediments
also constituted each area a congenial habitat for its aquatic fauna and
that consequently the whole life history of each of those faunas was
intimately counected with the production of the formation in which its
remains are found, while contemporary land faunas and floras bore no
‘such direct relation to it. Furthermore, reasons were given why it
may be accepted as a fact that as a necessary consequence of the con-
ditions of their habitat, every species of every aquatic fauna which
possessed fossilizable parts, was originally fully represented in the for-
mation to which the fauna pertained, while all other kinds of fossil re-
mains have always very imperfectly represented the faunas and floras
to which they belonged. Besides this, their presence in any formation
was always the result of accident.

Although these are sufficient reasons why remains of aquatic faunas
are always of greater value than any other in the identification of for-
mations, that fact does not imply that other kinds are not of the high-
est value for other purposes nor that they are valueless for this purpose.
For example, although land faunas and floras bore no direct relation
to the production of a formation, it is evident that the effects of the
physical changes which respectively inaugurated and closed its depo-
sition would in each case have been of such a character, and that they
would have been so extended upon the land, as to cause important
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 279

changes in the contemporaneous land fauna and flora. Therefore it is
to: be assumed that such faunas and floras in their entirety bore an
important indirect relation to the respective formations with the pro-
duction of which they were contemporaneous, and that such of their
remains as found intombment in their sediments would be largely
characteristic of them.

Still, the incongruity of the biological relation and of the physical
conditions of existence of land faunas and floras to aquatic faunas,
and the accidental relation of such of the remains of the former as
became fossilized to the sediments in which they were intombed render
it difficult to treat the evidence aftorded by fossils of terrestrial origin
as concurrent with that which is afforded by aquatic fossil faunas. This
difficulty is increased by the incompleteness of representation by fossil
remains of land animals as entire faunas, and that of plants not only as
entire floras but as individual members of them.

Furthermore, remains of land animals and plants have never beet
found in any of the fossiliferous formations of the earlier geological ages,
and in the marine formations of the later ages* they are rarely, and
usually never, found.t Therefore their study, except in cases of doubt-
ful value, is confined to the nonmarine formations of the carboniferous
and later ages. The restricted range of such studies as compared with
that of the study of other fossils is the more apparent when it is remem-
bered how small is the proportion of non marine to marine formations.
These remarks are by no means to be understood as suggesting the
rejection of any kind of evidence in any case or as calling in question
the general paleontological, and the purely biological, value of fossil
remains of terrestrial origin. It is only claimed that their value in the
characterization, identification, and limitation of formations is below
that of remains of aquatic faunas.

It was also méntioned in the preceding essay that the biological
characterization of any formation is fully recognizable only by means
of its fossil fauna or flora, each as a whole, and not by separate mem-
bers of either, although separate members, especially of an aquatic
fauna, because of their limited vertical range, are often sufficient for
its identification after its characterization has been fully established.
This fact is of importance in every estimate of the true value of fossil
remains in practical geology, because, notwithstanding their paramount
value as evidence in the cases referred to, no evidence in such cases is
ever so complete as to be beyond the need of accessory support.

The foregoing remarks apply to that direct practical use of fossils
which is necessary from the beginning to the close of every investiga-
tion of structural geology. ‘The following apply to their more indirect
use in reaching conclusions of a general character, but which are also

*See table on Plate x1v, showing time ranges of animals and plants.

2S() REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

of practicalimportance in all such investigations. Besides other appli-
cations that may be made of the facts mentioned in those remarks, they
show the necessity for the study of the different kinds of aquatic faunas
with relation to one another, and make it evident that so great a differ-
ence in their kinds and in the conditions of their origin implies a wide
range of practical applicability to geological studies.

Comparative studies of this kind are prosecuted mainly by the philo-
sophical method and require a consideration of various biological and
physical facts. Among them are those which relate to the various gen-
eral conditions under which sedimentary formations were produced and
the more special conditions under which the aquatic faunas lived whose
remains now characterize them, The general conditions referred to
are largely of a geographical character, while the more special relate
to the quality of the water in which the respective faunas lived as the
element of their habitation.

The fact that the fossil remains of aquatic animals generally possess
inherent and unmistakable evidence as to the character and quality of
the respective bodies of water in which were deposited the sedimentary
rocks which are now found to contain them was recognized at an early
date, and the character of that evidence is such that there never has
been any important disagreement among geologists as to its trust-
worthiness.* Indeed they usually and properly assume that there is as
little room for reasonable doubt as to the quality of the water in which
pach fossil aquatic fauna lived as would be the case if those waters
were still subject to a gustatory test or to chemical analysis.t Admis-
sible evidence as to the quality of the water relates only or mainly to the
presence and comparative proportion of salt in, or to its absence from,
the various bodies of water which have existed during geological time,
and in which sedimentary deposits were made. In other words, it is
the kind of evidence that indicates whether those waters were fresh,
brackish, or of marine saltness. Such evidence indicates whether the
water in which a given formation was deposited was marine, estuarine,
lacustrine, or fluviatile, and all this evidence, although relating to
physical questions, rests upon comparisons of fossil remains of aquatic
faunas with corresponding parts of members of now living faunas whose
structural characteristics and restrictions of habitat are known. The
marine so greatly preponderate over all other kinds of aquatie faunas
that it is convenient in discussing the sedimentary formations to make
the general distinction of marine and nonmarine, the former term not

~The criteria of the character of formerly existing bodies of water are discussed
in Essay vil, but they are briefly referred to here in discussing the subject of this
essay.

tIt is probable that the earliest oceanic waters were much less salt than are those
of the present day because the earth has ever since been subjected to a process of
leaching, with the oceans as a reservoir, but the comparisons here made apply
mainly to comparatively late portions of geological time.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 281

needing definition, the latter being applied to all faunas that are re-
garded as having lived in either brackish or fresh waters.

In making practical application of the evidence which has been re-
ferred to, it is the general conditions which are indicated by the special
that will most need tv, be considered. For example, the marine char-
acter of a fauna having been ascertained, the conclusion is legitimate,
in the absence of conflicting evidence, that the area which constituted
its habitat was bordered wholly or mainly by other marine areas, and
that their sediments and faunas blended to a greater or less extent with
one another. In other words, sucha fauna indicates that its habitat
was part of a great oceanic expanse which was occupied by other
more or less similar faunas.

In case a fossil aquatic fauna should present intrinsic evidence of its
brackish water origin the inference would be legitimate that its habitat

yas either an estuary or an inland sea, and in ease the fauna should
prove to be of fresh water origin we must conclude that the habitat
was either a riveroralake. Inall of these nonmarine cases the habitat
had more definite boundaries than could have been the case with that
of any marine fauna, and usually, but not necessarily always, a non-
marine formation has a less geographical extent than have marine for-
mations. It is true that an estuary fauna blends in part with the
adjacent marine fauna on the one hand and with the fluviatile fauna on
the other, but its other limits are shore lines such as alone constitute
the faunal boundaries of all other nonmarine bodies of water.

The estuarine, fluviatile, or lacustrine origin of a deposit or formation
having been ascertained by means of the character of its fossil remains,
aided by the accompanying physical indications, important inferences
are to be drawn as to the geographical conditions which prevailed in
that region at the time of its deposition. For example, the existence
of an estuary deposit implies that contemporaneously with its deposi-
tion there was an adjacent body of marine water, and also a large land,
if not a continental, area which was drained by the inflowing river.*
Again, every lake or inland sea, the former existence of which may be
determined by the character of the fossil aquatic fauna which the for-
mation representing it contains, was necessarily surrounded by a broad
land area.

The foregoing remarks apply to methods of distinguishing between
formations of marine and nonmarine origin, and to the legitimate
inferences that may be drawn from them, respectively, as to the physical
conditions which prevailed while they were accumulating. In closing
this essay it is desirable to present some remarks upon the relative
value in practical geological field work of the fossils found in marine
and nonmarine formations, respectively.

That the fossil remains of marine faunas are far more valuable as in-

but brackish water estuaries only are here referred to
282 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

dicators of the chronological divisions of the geological scale and of the
correlation of its divisions in different parts of the world than are those
of nonmarine faunas is apparent to everyone who is familiar with even
the general facts of biological geology, but it does not follow, and it is
not true, that the latter are intrinsically less valuable than are the for-
mer in field studies of practical geology. For this practical work both
marine and nonmarine fossils are treated by the empirical method
already explained, and both are found to characterize the respective
formations in the same manner.

Certain conditions, however, give each an advantage over the other
under different circumstances. For example, the geographical range
of the nonmarine invertebrate fossil faunas, especially those of fresh
water, having been sharply defined by shore lines, the species which
constituted them are to that extent more characteristic of the forma-
tions in which they occur than is the case with marine faunas. Cer-
tain species of the latter faunas, as already shown, usually ranged
beyond the limits of the area which was occupied by each fauna as a
whole.

Nonmarine formations as a rule occur singly in a series of marine
formations, in which case the vertical as well as the geographical range
of their invertebrate species is sharply defined. It is true that in the
interior portion of North America there is a continuous series of fresh
water formations and that certain of the species range from one into
another. These, however, are notable exceptions to the rule referred
to, and they at most only make such nonmarine faunas equal to the
average marine fauna as regards exceptional vertical range of species.
Again, nonmarine formations usually have the advantage of the pres-
ence of remains of plants and of land vertebrates and invertebrates,
which in marine formations are usually so extremely rare as to be
unavailable.

On the other hand, marine faunas embrace such a wide diversity of
forms as compared with the nonmarine, and their progressive and dif-
ferential evolution from epoch to epoch has been so much greater that
they offer as faunas much more abundant means for the characteriza-
tion and identification of formations. It is clear, however, that the
opinion which some geologists have expressed or implied that the fos-
sil contents of nonmarine formations are of little value in practical
geological investigation is not well founded. The following are the
principal conclusions reached in the foregoing discussions:

Formations being the only true units of local or regional strati-
graphic classification, their correct identification is the first, and an in-
dispensable, step in the practical field work of structural geology.

Although formations as such have only a physical existence, their
biological characteristics are always the best, and often the only, means
of their identification, and therefore the exhaustive study of fossils is
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 283

of paramount importance in connection with all practical investiga-
tions of that kind.

The value of fossils in this respect is as purely practical as is that
of any other aid to geological investigation, and it may be made avail-
able without reference to their great value in other respects.

Although all fossil remains are valuable for this practical use, those
of aquatic faunas are more valuable than any others.

Remains of nonmarine faunas are of similar value for this purpose
to those of marine origin.

IV. THE RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO SYSTEMATIC AND HISTORICAL
GEOLOGY.

The preceding essay wes devoted to discussions showing the im-
portance of all fossil remains as well as the interrelative value of the
different kinds of the same in the prosecution of geological field work.
A leading object of that essay was to show that fossils constitute
the most important of the distinguishing characteristics of all sedi-
‘mentary formations and also the principal means of their identifica-
tion as physical units of stratigraphic classification within any district
or region. This essay is devoted to discussions of the more general
relation of fossil remains to geological investigation; that is, to general
discussions of the relation of biology, the science which they, together
with living animals and plants, represent, to certain of the broader
subjects of geological study. These subjects embrace systematic ge-
olgy, or the general classification of the stratified rocks of the earth,
historical geology, or the establishment of that classification upon a
chronological basis, and correlative geology, or the adjustment to one
another of the full chronological series of stratified rocks which occur
on each continent or large division of the same. The latter subject,
however, will be more specially discussed in Essay VI.

It has been made apparent in the preceding essays that each case
of structural classification of stratified rocks based upon formations as
physical units is independent of all others, and thatits application is
necessarily of limited geographical extent, because formations are them-
selves thus limited. It therefore follows that the structural geology
of any district or region, embracing even an extensive series of forma-
tions, may be practically and thoroughly investigated, as regards both
scientific accuracy and economic requirements, independently of that
of any other district or region, especially of those regions which are
not adjacent. It is now to be shown how the multitude of series of for-
mations thus locally classified throughout the world have been grouped
into a universal system of classification In connection with a scale hay-
ing its divisions arranged in chronological order.

The grandest and most comprehensive of the ideas which were con-
ceived and developed by the early geologists relates to the construc-
tion of this scale and the consequent reduction of geology to a univer-
sal system; but it is remarkable that although this idea is now known
to have an almost exclusively biological basis, its original conception
was not the result of correct biological knowledge as now understood,
but of empirical observation of physical and biological facts and a
sagacious perception of their interrelation.

It is true that while the early geologists relied mainly upon fossils as
indicators of the relative age of formations, the belief was at first
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 285

somewhat general among them that the consolidation of the sedimen-
tary rocks, and also in part their displacements, were secularly accom-
plished and therefore that such conditions are to that extent indicators
of their relative age; but these views did not long survive.

When the fossil faunas and floras which characterize each of a given
series of sedimentary formations are compared with those which sev-
erally characterize the formations of the next preceding and sue-
ceeding series, and the whole are systematically compared with living
faunas and floras, there is to be observed among those fossil forms, when
studied in connection with an unbroken vertical range of formations,
an order of successive changes and modifications indicative of a general
advance in biological rank and also an indication of structural relation-
ship. Furthermore, when the faunas and floras of a given series of
formations are compared with those of other series in other parts of the
world, it frequently appears that there is a close similarity between
those of a certain portion of each series which indicates their correla-
tion. In such cases an order of biological rank is to be observed sim-
ilar to that which was observed in the original case. It also frequently
occurs that the range of rank is found to be greater in one or both diree-
tions than is to be observed in other cases. By such means a knowl-
edge of the order of faunal and floral, as well as of stratigraphical, sue-
cession far beyond that which could be obtained in any one region, has
been acquired.

It is upon such empirical facts as these that the early geologists
based their investigations concerning the chronological arrangement
of the sedimentary formations of the earth, the grand result of which
was the adoption of a general scheme and the construction of a corre:
sponding scale for their classification. This scale, which in its present
condition is a masterpiece of inductive reasoning, necessarily originated
in Europe, because it was there that geology was first systematically
studied, and it is there also that its adaptation is more complete than
elsewhere. The first of the two following tables, the one to which, for
the sake of convenience, the date 1840 is given, represents the scale in
a condensed form as it was recognized and approved by leading geolo-
gists at, and a few years both prior and subsequent to, the date men-
tioned. !

The second table, the one bearing the date 1890, has been compiled

Tt is not my purpose to discuss historicallyany of the questions referred to in
these essays, but it is proper to remark that Cuvier and Brongniart seem to have
been the first to apply paleontology to the study of struetural geology (1800-1812),
and that William Smith did the same, apparently independently of the two authors
just named, in 1816, 1817. In 1819 Brongniart advanced the idea of correlating dis-

It was the intention of the founders of this scale, as it is and has
been of all other geologists, that it should represent the whole of geo-
logical time from the beginning of life upon the earth until the begin-
ning of the epoch of human history,* and that its divisions in the order
in which they are named in the tables should represent consecutive
portions of that time. It is necessarily assumed that each of these
time divisions was represented by sedimentary deposits wherever dur-
ing its continuance bodies-of water existed upon the earth, and where
they did not exist the passage of time was not recorded at all, or that
it was not so recorded as to be understood without reference to the
aqueous record as represented by the scale. That is, it is necessarily
assumed that although during every epoch of geological time there
were portions of the earth’s surface upon which no sedimentary de-
posits were made because they were then above water level, there were
during every epoch large portions of it beneath waters which were
constantly depositing sediments. Thus, contemporaneously with such
breaks in sedimentation within certain regions as have just been men-

use of which term no direct reference is made torsiderial time.

288 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

tioned, sedimentation was continuous and comparatively undisturbed
inothers. Therefore, notwithstanding the occurrence of numerous and
extensive breaks, there has been an abundant and continuous sedimen-
tary record made for the whole earth. It is to this continuous record
that the great geological scale is applied. Although the statement that
sedimentation has been continuous upon the larger part of the earth’s
surface during every epoch of geological time now accords with the
views of all geologists, it will be seen by proposition 3, on page 291 that
in certain particulars it does not agree with those of the early geolo-
gists; but this matter will be discussed on following pages.

In dividing and subdividing the scale geologists have generally ree-
ognized three grades of divisions, as is Shown by the three columns of
names in each of the two preceding tables, the second grade being
subordinate to the first, and the third to the second. The divisions of
the first grade are general, only three in number, and evidently very
unequal as to the actual duration of time represented by each. Those
of the second grade are more, and those of the third still more special.
The divisions of the third grade may each be locally represented by a
single formation or by more than one. That is, formations are not the
natural units of this seale.

The different divisions of each of these three grades are unequal to
one another, but for convenience of classification they are treated as
of similar rank in each grade. It is not, however, to be understood
that the different divisions of the same grade represent at best more
than a remote approximation to equal portions of time or to equal
average advances of animals and plants in biographical rank Besides
this, the sedimentary accumulations which represent any one of the
divisions of the respective grades may be many times greater than
those of another division of the same grade, but the bulk of formations
is not an index of the relative length of time within which each was
accumulated, because the rate of sedimentary accumultion was always
extremely variable.

In discussing the divisions of such a classification as these tables
represent it is desirable that for the sake of clearness of statement each
of them should have both a structural and chronological designation.
That is, the general designation given to each of the assemblages of
strata which constitutes a division or subdivision in such a classification
ought, if practicable, to have a time correlative. The general failure of
authors to agree upon such a plan is doubtless due to the natural dif-
culty of correlating a chronological idea with physical objects which
among themselves are of unequal quantity and, to a certain extent, of

variable quality. In my own writings, however, I have generally used
the term epoch as a time correlative of formation, and the term age as a
time correlative of system,* but for present convenience I shall vary my
custom in the latter respeet which will be the less objectionable because

¥ eee

“See for example, Geology of Iowa, White, 1870, vol. 1, p. 25.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 289

the custom of geologists has not been uniform as to the general desig-
nation given to each of the three grades represented by the three coil-
umns of the tables. In referring to and discussing these tables I shall
therefore apply the time term stage instead of age to systems or divisions
of the second grade or middle column of the tables and the term sub-
stage to the divisions of the third grade or left hand column.

It will be seen by the foregoing statements that although the great
scale in its entirety is comprehensive and trustworthy it is indefinite
and unequal in its divisions and subdivisions, respectively. The sig-
nificance of this indefiniteness and inequality is made more or less
apparent in the discussions which are recorded on following pages.

Although the purpose of this scale is the classification of the sedi-
mentary rocks of the earth its real units are not physical but chronc-
logical. That is, formations are not the units in this case as they are
in the structural geology of districts or limited regions, but these units
are such divisions of time as are indicated by the successive changes
in the structure and character of the animals and plants which have
existed upon the earth from the beginning of life until now. It is true,
as has already been shown, that the chronological order of succession
of afew formations may sometimes be determined within limited regions
by means of their actually observed superposition, without reference
to the fossil remains which they may contain. Such a method of de-
termining that order, however, is wholly inadequate for general pur-
poses because opportunities for observing successive cases of super-
position are comparatively rare and because formations never possess
any other than biological characteristics which originally could have
suggested the idea of their age with reference to the full course of
geological time. Theretore,a rational scheme of universal stratigraphic
classification can have no other than a biological basis. That is, its
real basis must be the evidence which fossils afford of the progressive
evolution of organic forms during the progress of geological time and
the various divisions and subdivisions of a resulting scale, while they
must of necessity be locally recognized with reference to formations
and systems, must coincide with widely recognizable secular stages in
the progress of the evolution. In short, the true basis of such a scheme
of classification is essentially a great biological idea to which material
expression is given by its application to the successive accumulations
of sedimentary deposits which now constitute the stratified rocks of
the earth.

A comparison of the two preceding tables, although they represent
only an abridgment of the great scale, will show at a glance how well
the early geologists accomplished the work of constructing it. It will
be observed that after more than fifty years of active scientific investi-
gation the only essential changes that have been found necessary are
the filling of afew gaps and the more complete definition of the Cambrian

system at its base. Still, it is a fact that those pioneers of geological
science builded better than they knew, for they accomplished their work
at atime when the views of naturalists upon the vital prineiples of
biology were radically different from those which now prevail.* They,
therefore, misconceived the true character of the basis of the scheme
upon which they constructed their scale, and yet their structure remains
without need of material change after a revolution in the methods of
thought upon the subjects to which its fundamental idea pertains, the
equal of which has never been known in the history of scientific inves-
tigation. That is, the scale, notwithstanding their misconception of
its underlying principles, was constructed in accordance with certain
immutable facts which they used wisely in their structure but inter-
preted wrongly as to the relation to those principles of the facts which
they so clearly perceived. It is to their erroneous interpretation of
facts and the influence which that interpretation has had upon later
investigators that I now desire to call special attention.

Although the scale now in use was established before the truth of
the progressive evolution of organic forms was accepted by naturalists
and when all differences between those forms was believed to be due
to special creations, general progression in average biological rank dur-
ing geological time was perceived by the early geologists as well as by
those of the present day, but with them it was the perception of a progres-
sive succession in rank of faunal and floral groups of great assemblages
of organic forms, and not the recognition of the principle of evolution.
Therefore they sought methods of explaining the facts and conditions
which they observed with reference to the geological scale which they
had established that should accord with the biological views which
then prevailed, and which were largely of a supernatural character.
Indeed, in the absence of the now prevalent natural method of explain-
ing these facts the supernatural method of the early geologists seems
to have been necessary.

The following deductive propositions which now remind a naturalist
of the articles of a creed more than of a statement of scientific princi-
ples, are presented as indicating the fundamental ideas held by the
early geologists in connection with the construction of the geological
scale and as illustrating the state of prevalent opinion among leading
eeologists upon biological subjects in their time. It is true that no one

“It is true that during those early years of geological investigation there were a
few advanced thinkers who held a belief in the progressive evolution of all organic
forms, but their views were then at best only tolerated by the great body of
naturalists.

+ This revolution occurred about midway of the time that is discussed with refer-
ence to the two preceding tables—that is, about midway between 1840 and 1893.
The fact that this time embraces nearly the whole history of really scientifie geolog-
ical investigation is suggestive of a hope that within less than a like number of
years all the inherited effects of the erroneous views of the pioneers upon biological
geology will have been eliminated.

author has ever published these propositions in the exact form in
which they are here presented, but I have formulated them from the
published utterances of numerous authors and from my personal recol-
lections of an active participation in geological work during a number
of years immediately preceding the great revolution in methods of bio
logical thought and investigation which has been referred to. In stat-
ing these propositions reference is necessarily made to the divisions and
subdivisions of the table on page 286, representing the geological scale
for 1840, and to the paragraphs preceding and following it. These
propositions are:

(1) That every species of animals and plants, both living and extinct, was specially
created, and that they are, and always have been, immutable. That genera, and
also the higher groups into which both the animal and vegetable kingdoms are Sys-
tematically divisible, are categories of creative thought. and that they also are im-
mutable.

(2) That although secular extinction of certain species, and even genera, occurred
during every stage of the geological scale, at the close of each stage, except the
Tertiary, all life upon the earth was simultaneously destroyed, and that at the close
of each substage life was at least in large part destroyed.

(3) That, at the close of each stage coincidently with, and the divinely ordained
instrument of, the complete extinction of lire there was a universal physical catas-
trophe, and that the close of each substage was, at least in part, physically catastro-
phic.

(4) That all life for each successive stage was created anew.

(5) That the life of each stage embraced specially ordained generic, or more gen-
eral, types which were distinctive of and peculiar to it, and that the‘r distribution
was world-wide.

(6) That there was a special ordination of characteristic types for each substage,
which received world-wide and simultaneous distribution within its narrow time
limits.

(7) That no identical and few similar, specific forms were created for any two or
more stages.

(8) That the world-wide distribution of the distinctive types of animals and plants
which were ordained to characterize any stage or substage was effected in connec-
tion with the act by which their respective faunas and floras were created; or that
in the case of species not having a world-wide distribution the typical integrity of
faunas and floras was preserved by the introduction of representative, that is, closely
similar, but distinct species.

(9) That by creative design the average biological rank of each new creation was
higher than that of the next preceding one.

(10) That upon the fossilizable parts of the animals and plants which were cre-
ated for each stage, and upon those designed to characterize each substage, was
impressed not only their own structural features, but recognizable evidence of their
chronological ordination.

These propositions represent only those views of the pioneer geolo-
gists which pertain to biological geology. Other views which were
held by them are unassailable, eyen in the light of the present advance
of science, and their biological views are not introduced here for the
purpose of disparagement, but to show that they gave origin to certain
erroneous methods which are in part retained as an inheritance by
292 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

some paleontologists * even though they ostensibly accept the princi-
ples of modern biology. . .

It is evident from these propositions that the methods adopted by
the early geologists of explaining the phenomena with which they had
to deal, when any explanation was attempted, were based upon a belief
in the supernatural origin and direct divine ordination of those phe-
nomena, and not upon what is now accepted as a correct: knowledge of
natural laws. It will also be seen that among them leading ideas was
that of sharp definition, not only of all the forms of animal and vege-
table life, but of the divisions of the geological scale, and consequently
of all the divisions of geological time. Of all the ideas which they
conceived and held, to which proper exception can be taken, the influ-
ence of the one just mentioned, notwithstanding its consistency with
natural laws, has evidently produced the most lasting influence upon
modern geology. Some of the effects of this influence will be shown
in the following propositions and in the remarks which follow them
respectively.

The foregoing propositions relate to what were regarded by the early
geologists as fundamental ideas in the construction of the geological
scale, while the following relate to those ideas which are now held to
constitute its true basis because they only accord with natural laws.
These are therefore essentially a counter statement of the preceding
propositions, but the principal object of their ‘preparation is to point
out the true relation of biology to systematic, historical and correlative
geology. They consist largely of the statement of certain of the prin-
ciples involved in the theory of organic evolution, but they are by no
means intended as a full statement of those principles, nor are they
presented for the purpose of either discussing or defining them as such.
That is, the statements are made not for the purpose of formally enun-
ciating these principles, but for the purpose of making practical appli
cation of them to the subject in hand. I have selected forsstatement
and comment such of them as I believe to be accepted by all naturalists
who admit the truth of organic evolution, and I make such application
of them as I believe will necessarily commend itself to all geologists
who admit that truth and its applicability to biological geology.

These propositions are not intended to embrace the whole range of
biological geology, but only such ofits leading principles as are discussed

“As a rule I do not use the term paleontologist to indicate a geologist who prose-
cutes his investigations mainly from a biological standpoint. He has no more need
of a special designation than one who devotes himself to geological dynamics or to
stratigraphy, and much less than one who rejects the aid of fossil remains in the lat-
ter branch of geological investigation. In the present instance, however, I refer to
those who regard paleontological evidence not merely as essential in systematic
geology, but as independent of physical evidence. The latter claim will on follow-
ing pages be shown to be without rational foundation.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 293

in these essays. Therefore, a certain lack of immediate relevancy will
appear in the order in which they are stated.

(1) All species of animals and plants have originated genetically from preéxisting
forms, and therefore all are more or less mutable as regards their reproduction. These,
together with the various divisions higher than species into which the animal and
vegetable kingdoms are divisible, have respectively acquired their distinguishing
characteristics by differential and gradually progressive evolution. The extinction
of all species and other divisions of the animal and vegetable kingdoms which has
taken place during geological time has always been by natural means and in accord-
ance with natural laws. It has generally been secular and gradual, but in many
eases locally or regionally accidental. No universal extinction has ever occurred.

‘This proposition is presented mainly as a countercheck to those por-
tions of the preceding series of propositions which assert the special
creation and periodically universal extinction of species, and also as a
necessary concomitant of the propositions which follow. It is proper in
this connection, however, to make some general remarks concerning
species.

It was comparatively easy to define a species in accordance with the
views of the early naturalists, but it is more difficult to do so in aecord-
ance with the principles of modern biology. Because of this, and doubt-
less in part because of the lingering influence of those early views, there
is much difference of opinion as to what constitutes a species. This is
especially observable among those who describe and publish fossil re-
mains. Some treat every form which is describably different from
another as a distinct species, while others treat these closely similar
forms, especially if they evidently belong to the same fauna, as varieties,
and apply the term species in a more comprehensive manner.

I adopt the latter method in these essays, and regard as belonging to
one and the same species all assemblages of individual forms, even if
they are very variable, which occur in strata of the same stage, or if
they occur in adjacent or other stages, which there is reason to believe
freely interbred and were capable of producing the same kind with its

varieties,—that is, | regard species as being variable as well as muta:
ble. Still, although species are more or less variable, they have a
recognizable entity, for while they are mutable they possess a certain
tendeney to stability of characteristics which has remained through long
lines of reproduction or until gradually overcome by evolutional change.

(2) Coincident with the progress of evolution, notwithstanding the retardation,
inertion, and even degradation that have occurred along certain lines, there bas
heen during geological time a general average advancement in biological rank of ani-
mal and vegetable forms, evidence of which is afforded by certain characteristies of
their fossil remains. The evidence of this general advancement constitutes the ulti-
mate standard of measures of geological time as a whole and the principal means

of ascertaining the order of full succession of the events which attended the eh
duction of the stratified rocks of the earth.

ft is true, as was brietly mentioned in Essay 1, that the pre ietical
‘geologist finds numerous loeal indieations of ie Pinte age of for-
294 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

mations and of the order of occurrence of geological events, such as the
resting of one formation upon another, lava overflows, faults and other
displacements, subaerial erosion, etc. All such indications, however,
are of service only in local, or at best in regional, investigations, and
although they may be numerous and of great local value, they are
always so disconnected that they can never be reduced to a general
system of chronological classification, or even to a part of it, without
the aid of fossilremains. It, therefore, can not be too earnestly asserted
that the general advancement which has occurred during geological
time in the biological rank of organic forms, notwithstanding its varia-
tions and numerous discrepancies, together with their multifarious dif-
ferentiation, constitutes the only means of measuring that time as ¢
whole or of any considerable portions of it. It is to this abstract meas-
ure of time that material form has been given in the construction of the
geological scale.

Notwithstanding the indispensability and general trustworthiness
of this time-measure in the study of historical geology, it can not be
denied that it is not comparable in precision with the standard of
sidereal time, because the latter is mathematically definable, while the
former is based upon past biological conditions which were subject to
infinite and often great variation.

(3) The chronological features which fossils possess are not of a special character
as such, but they are among those upon which their biological classification is based,
all of which features have resulted from both progressive and differential evolution.

Progressive, and differential evolution were more or less completely
‘concurrent, but it was Sometimes the case that the latter was greatly in
excess of the former. From progressive evolution we have successive
stages in biological rank, and from differential evolution the infinite
rariety of forms which occur in approximately the same rank. Both
are often exemplified by one and the same series of fossil forms, but
in the study of historical geology the results obtained from each are
of different applicability. Those of progressive evolution are directly
chronological in character, and therefore of broader significance, than
are those of differential evolution, the results of the latter being only
indirectly chronological in character and of empirical applicability in
geological studies.

Progressive evolution has produced from the great mass of life which
has continuously existed upon the earth variously connected genetic
lines of organie forms, the aggregate of which lines extended through
the whole of geological time. The varying structure of these forms
exhibits grades of biological rank, which, by their continuity and their
relation to one another, become chronological in character as well as
constituting the basis of their biological classification.

Differential evolution has produced a great diversity of forms in each
of the principal grades of biological rank which have successively ex-
isted during geological time, and these are found by empirical study to
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. PAGS

characterize the respective stages and substages of the geological scale.
Wiile the principal evidence of the full chronological order of the
stages and substages of the scale has been derived from results of pro-
gressive evolution alone, the results of the empirical studies just men
tioned are of the utmost importance in systematic geology as well as in
all practical geological investigations. Indeed, not only the first steps
in the construction of the geological scale, but the working out of all its
details, are the result of empirical study, while the result of the philo-
sophical study of all its fossil forms followed and completed it as a
chronological standard.

(4) The average rate of progessive evolution for the different branches or divi-
sions of both the animal and vegetable kingdoms has not been the same for each in
all parts of the world, nor the same for all in any one part of the world, during all
the time they have coexisted.

While the various divisions of geological time as expressed in the
construction of the great geological scale are satisfactorilygrecognizable
by their respective fossil faunas and floras, each as a whole, their limits
are often obscured not only by the ranging of certain specific forms
from one to another, but by the relative acceleration and retardation of
the rate of progressive evolution of certain of the types which are dis-
tinetive of the divisions of the scale. Such retardation and accelera-
tion have oceurred in various divisions of both the animal and vegeta-
ble kingdoms, which has not only resulted in obscuring the limits of
the recognized divisions of the scale, but in imparing to some extent
the relative chronological value of the characteristics possessed by
fossil remains belonging to different branches respectively of the animal
and vegetable kingdoms.

These differences in rate were no doubt largely due to inherent differ-
ences between those great groups of organic forms respectively, but they
were also largely due to differences in the effects of the same environing
conditions upon different groups; that is, the conditions which were
congenial to the existence of marine, fresh water, and land faunas and
land floras, respectively, or, in short, the conditions under which marine
and continental life, each as a whole existed, have been so different and
in Many Cases so incongruous that their relative rate of advancement
in progressive evolution was necessarily unequal even under similar
climatic and hydrographic conditions, and much more unequal when
these conditions were different.

For example, in Europe a certain progressive grade was reached for
the whole of animal and vegetable life which all geologists recognize
as Cretaceous. In North America remains of invertebrate life, and im
part those of vertebrate life, exhibit evidence of essentially the same
Cretaceous grade, but associated remains of vegetable life show a much
more advanced grade, while a few vertebrate types show an earlier or
retarded grade, all being judged by the European standard.

The foregoing remarks apply particularly to the first part of propo-
296 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

sition 4. The second part finds abundant illustration in the great dis-
parity of advancement in rank between molluscan and mammalian life
during Tertiary time and between molluscan and dinosaurian life dur-
ing Mesozoic time. ‘The disparity is seen to be all the greater if only
the fresh water mollusca are considered, the slight differential develop-
ment of which during successive epochs of geological time is mentioned
and referred to in following paragraphs.

In these essays the term type* is usually employed with reference to
the chronological significance of the forms or groups of forms thus des-
ignated. Their succession in time was not necessarily coincident with
progressive evolution, but they were always the result of differential
evolution. Their chronological value to the geologist depends upon the
definiteness of the limits of their time range. Usually their time range
was comparatively short, but sometimes they continued their existence
through long periods of time. A considerable number of types are
specially characteristic of each stage of the geological scale, but any
of them were liable to range beyond its limits.

(5) The rate of differential evolution among the forms constituting certain
divisions of the animal and vegetable kingdoms was greater than that among those
constituting other divisions; and it was greater for some of the members of a given
division under certain conditions than it was for other members of the same divi-
sion under other conditions.

The truth of this proposition may be more clearly shown by exam-
ples than by explanation. Some of the most remarkable examples of
shght differential evolution during a succession of geological periods
being furnished by fresh water and land mollusean faunas, these may
first be mentioned.

Fossil remains of numerous fresh water gill-bearing molluscan fau-
nas have been found in North American strata belonging to nearly
every geological period from the Jurassic to the post-Tertiary, inelu-
sive, each fauna consisting of members most, and sometimes all, of
which belong to genera that are abundantly represented by living
Species; that is, only a small proportion at most of extinct genera,
and no extinct families are known to have been included in any of
these faunas. In short, the differential evolution of the North Ameri-
can fresh water mollusca during the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras seems -

Because the term ‘“‘ type” is used in theseessays in a special and also asomewhat
variable sense, it requires explanatory definition. It is herein used to indicate groups
of animal or vegetable forms which have certain recognizable but often difficultly
describable, characteristics in common. Such groups are sometimes identical with
genera, but they are sometimes less, and often more comprehensive, even embracing
families and, in rare eases, orders. They usually have only an incidental relation
to the groups which are recognized as divisions of the systematic classification of
animals and plants, but they sometimes coincide with them or constitute accessory
features of such classification. Types thus designated are recognizable by general
form, peculiar details of essential parts of structure, accessory features, or a general
summary of peculiarities of structure or biological characteristics.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 297

to have been confined mainly to specific variation, and im many cases
this also was slight. These remarks apply equally to the gasteropods
and lamellibranchiates. Furthermore, the land and palustral pulmo-
nate mollusks which were contemporary with those just mentioned
seem as a whole to have been subject to little if any greater degree of
differential evolution than were the others. It is true that progressive
evolution in the case of all these mollusks was also very slight, but
that does not explain the cause of the slight differential evolution.

During the time that all those fresh water and land mollusks were
so slightly affected by evolutional change marine mollusks were not
only extremely differentiated, but many genera and soine families sue-
essively became extinct and many others were introduced. During
that time also some of the most important advances were made in both
progressive and differential evolution of animal and vegetable forms
that have ever occurred upon the earth. So far as is now known all
exogenous plants began their existence since those mollusks began
theirs, and the earlier ones mentioned were contemporaneous with the
most flourishing period of the dinosaurs. That great reptilian sub-
class passed its climax of development and became extinet, and yet
those mollusks were meantime but little changed.

An example of extreme differential evolution is afforded by the Tri-
lobites, which in the early geological ages became greatly differenti-
ated, but from the time the order became established to that of its ex-
tinction there was comparatively little advancement in biological rank.
A somewhat similar example is afforded by the dinosaurs. While
their rank among reptiles was the highest the difference in average
rank between the earliest and latest known forms belonging to that
subclass is comparatively small and little, if any, in favor of the latter
forms. The Mammalia afford a notable example of both progressive
and differential evolution, ranging in time from the early Tertiary and
in rank ending with man.

(6) The succession of gradual mutations in the development of the leading classi-
ficatory features which characterize certain groups of fossil forms was not neces-
sarily concurrent with consecutive portions of time.

For example, the mutations of the flexures of the dental sae which
produced the various structural features of the teeth by which the dift
ferent groups ofthe maminalia were characterized, or those of the mantle
in the production of the lobes and saddles of the septa of chambered
cephalopods, did not in either case occur along a single line of progres-
sive evolution, but along numerous differential lines coincident with each
of which the rate of biological progress was different from that of others.
Therefore advanced stages of progress must necessarily have been
reached on certain of those lines contemporaneously with much retarded
stages on others, and similar stages of progress were reached at more
or less widely separated intervals of time.

This statement concerning the dental features of the Mammalia and
298 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

the septal features of the chambered cephalopods* is only intended to
show that while they really have a good degree of chronological value
they can not be relied upon to indicate consecutive portions of time, nor
as absolute tokens of substages of the geological seale.

(7) The progress of secular extinction of species and other divisions of the animal
and vegetable kingdoms, including the types which specially characterize the various
stages and substages of the geological scale, was accelerated by adverse changes of
environing conditions and were retarded by a continuance of congenial conditions.
The final consummation of the extinction of the types was naturally often, and
perhaps usually, caused by catastrophic changes of conditions which occurred within
the limited areas to which they were reduced by approaching secular extinction.

Secular extinction of all of these forms would naturally begin in those
localities which first became uncongenial and would be longest deferred
where congenial conditions lingered longest. It has thus happened
that certain of the types which specially characterized a given stage or
substage of the geological scale have survived in some parts of the
world long after they became extinct in other parts, and indeed after
the close of the stage or substage which they and their associates had
specially characterized. In such cases the surviving types are found
associated with those which characterize a later stage or substage than
the one in which they originated.

In this way, for example, it is possible that a given assemblage of
strata in one region which upon ex parte paleontological evidence would
beassigned to the Cretaceous was actually contemporaneous with another
assemblage elsewhere, which, upon other ex parte evidence would be
assigned to the Tertiary. A similar statement may be made concerning
any of the other systems or stages of the geological scale with reference
to those which adjoin them respectively.

It is not necessary to infer that the locally catastrophic changes
which completed the final act of extinction of species and types were
always, or even generally, due to violent physical movements of the
earth’s crust. Such physical changes as would diminish food supply,
increase the number and relative strength of enemies, alter climatic
conditions, or affect the quality of habitable waters were doubtless the
usual immediate causes of final extinction.

(8) The geographical distribution of species within the time limits of the stages
and substages of the geological scale, and consequently that of the distinguishing
types which the species constitute, has been effected by natural means. Such means
included not only locomotory and mechanical dispersion within those time-limits
from one original center which was then the terminus of an evolutional line, but, at
least in the same cases, survival in various regions by separate evolutional lines
from the faunas of preceding stages and substages was also included.

* Because these septal features were extraneous to the bodily structure and bore no
known relation to that structure or to any animal function it may well be questioned
whether a classification based upon them is accordant with that which their anato-
mical structure might have furnished. Indeed the philosophical naturalist can not
be entirely satisfied with such a classification. The case is different, however, as
regards mammalian dentition, which has direct relation to essential structure and
bodily functions,
RELATION OF BIOLOGY T10 GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 299

It can not be reasonably doubted that as a rule the specific forms
which constitute the fossil aquatic fauna of any stage or substage of
the geological scale reached the localities where they are found by
geographical dispersion from a single genetic center, even in cases of
unusually great dispersion. Still,it seems impossible that all the fossil
forms which geologists usually feel obliged to regard as representing
separate species could have originated and become dispersed in that
manner. It therefore may be reasonably assumed that each of the
really or apparently identical forms which occur in different regions,
but which belong to one certain stage or substage, may have reached
their respective geographical stations within that stage or substage by
separate evolutional lines from a common ancestral form which existed
ina preceding stage, which lines were too slightly differentiated to
produce new specific characteristics. In short, paleontological evidence
seems to warrant the conclusion that in many cases, at least, both
generic and specific forms have originated independently in different
parts of the world, not only contemporaneously, but at successive inter-

vals of time.

If species and genera really had such a diversity of origin as has
been suggested, the various types which they constitute and which are
held to characterize the various stages and substages of the geological
scale may be assumed to have originated in a similarly diverse manner. .
Furthermore, the variable rate of differential evolution suggests a rea-
son why certain of the characteristic types of a given stage or substage
might naturally have survived the others and continued their existence
into the next substage, as indicated in the paragraph following propo-
sition 9.

(9) The animal and vegetable life of each stage of the geological scale was in the
aggregate different as to its forms from that of all others, and each stage and sub-
stage was further specially characterized by certain generic, and also more general,
types or peculiar groups of species. These types, however, were not necessarily
confined within absolute time-limits.

So distinctive are the assemblages of types of organic forms which
characterize each of the stages or systems of stratified rocks that, not-
withstanding the exceptions mentioned in preceding paragraphs, the
experienced geologist upon such evidence alone readily assigus to its
proper stage of the great geological scale comprehensive collections of
fossil remains from any given series of stratified rocks in any part of
the world. For example, the great Carboniferous system has been by
means of its fossils as distinetly recognized in Asia and in North and
South America as in Europe where it was first studied, and in all those
parts of the world it has been supposed to be sharply definable and
wholly distinct, as to its fossil forms, from the Triassic above and the
Devonian beneath. Later investigations, however, have shown that
Devonian and Carboniferous types are often commingled upon the
lower, and Carboniferous and Triassic types upon the upper, confines
of the Carboniferous system.
300 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Such a commingling of types is known to occur upon the confines of
other systems as well as the Corboniferous, and the discovery of similar
faunal conditions is to be expected in the case of any of them in all
regions where the successive series of stratified rocks is complete.
That is, where there is a sharply defined boundary between any two
systeims it has been due to such physical changes as broke the conti-
huity of sedimentation and of life for the region in whieh it occurred.

(10) Although movements and displacements of the earth’s crust have from time
to time occurred over large portions of its surface, arresting sedimentation or chang-
ing its character and causing great destruction of life, there has never been a uni-
versal catastrophe'of that kind. On the contrary, during all the time that disastrous
conditions prevailed in any given area, conditions congenial to the existence and
perpetuity of life prevailed in other and greater areas.

It is this persistence of congenial physical conditions over large por-
tions of the earth’s surface while smaller portions were disastrously
affected that has not only insured the perpetuity of life in general, but
that has insured the survival of certain chronological types of living
forms in some parts of the earth after their complete extinction in
other parts. Furthermore it is the evidence of the unbroken continuity
of sedimentation attending those congenial conditions, as well as that
of the unbroken continuity of life, which renders it difficult and often
impracticable to draw distinet physical, as well as biological, lines of de-
marcation between contiguous stages and substages of the geological
seale, especially when attempting to determine the correlation of the
divisions of the seale for different parts of the world.

The second of the two sets of propositions, together with the accom-
panying remarks, which are recorded on the preceding pages, show
that certain of the views held by the early geologists, notably those
which assumed the universally sharp definition of all the divisions of
the geological scale, were radically wrong. Still, it is evident to every
one who is familiar with modern geological literature that those views
have continued to exert an adverse influence upon the biological
branch of geological investigation long after they have been formally
rejected, even by those who continued to be influenced by them. The
early geologists adopted methods of investigation which were consis-
tent with their biological views, but I have shown that from the pres-
ent standpoint of biology certain of those views were so fundamentally
wrong that the methods which were based upon them are quite out of
place in modern investigation. Still, those methods of our energetic
predecessors have come down to the present time with such force and
with such evidence of the general correctness of the scale which they
had established by them that it has been difficult for their successors
to adopt the modification of methods which has been necessitated by
the great subsequent revolution in biological thought and methods of
investigation.

The facts which have been presented on the preceding pages show
that, while the scale which the early geologists established is a wonder-
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION, 301

ful production of human reasoning and the best possible general stand-
ard which can be adopted before a comparatively full investigation of
the geology of the whole earth has been made, it is not, and can not
be except in a general way, of universal applicability. That is, while
the respective stages and substages of the scale are recognizable only
by means of their characteristic fossil remains, it has been shown that
any of those characteristic forms are so liable to range from one stage
or substage to another that it is impossible to sharply define the limits
of stages, and often impossible to distinguish substages in one part of
the world as they are known in another part.

The facts and principles which are enunciated and explained in this
essay are of great importance in discussions of the relative chronologi-
sal value of the different kinds of fossil remains and of the correlation
of series of strata in separate regions of the earth, both of which sub-
jects will, however, be specially discussed in following essays.

There is another subject which, if more data were available, might
be profitably discussed at length in this connection. This subject. re-
lates to what may be designated as paleoclimatic conditions,* that is,
to formerly existing conditions,which in certain parts of the earth were
more or less materially different from those which now exist in the
same parts. The evidence thatsuch climatic changes have occurred
upon the earth’s surface consists of the presence of the fossil remains
of kinds of animals and plants the living congeners of which could not
exist in such a climate as now prevails there. For example, abundant
fossil remains of arboreal floras are found in Greenland far north of the
present northern limit of trees, and fossil corals are found at various
localities in similar latitudes which are still farther beyond the northern
limit of living coral-forming polyps.

These and similar cases must be taken as positive proof that great
changes of climate have occurred upon the earth, but there are other
cases which are frequently accepted as evidence of such changes that
are of a more doubtful character. That is, there is much reason to
believe that certain kinds of animals and plants formerly lived under
chmatie conditions which their nearest living congeners seem incapable
of enduring. For example, the natural range of living elephants,
rhinoceroses, and palins does not reach beyond a warm-temperature
climate, but remains of certain species of those animals have been found
where arctic winters prevail, and they are known to have been pro-
vided with a hairy protection against the cold. Remains of palms
have also been found associated with those of fossil floras that indicate
at least a cool temperate, if not a more severe, climate.

There is a multitude of other facts which bear upon this subject, but
only these references to it are introduced here to indicate it as one of
those which the geologist needs to bear in mind in all his biological
investigations, especially those which pertain to correlation.

V. THE RELATIVE CHRONOLOGICAL VALUE OF FOSSIL REMAINS.

The discussions in the preceding essay of the positive value of fossil
remains in systematic and historical geology have made it apparent
that there is much difference in their relative value, especially as regards
their use in characterizing the different stages of the geological scale and
in determining the geological age of the strata in which-they may be dis-
covered. it is this subject, the relative chronological value of fossil
remains, which I propose to discuss in this essay.

The basis of comparison of such values is a matter of much impor-
tance. The early geologists believed that all kinds of animals and
plants were specially endowed at their creation with a certain chrono-
logical impress, but that this impress, being more distinctly recogniz-
able in the fossil remains of some kinds than in those of others, they are
consequently of greater chronological value. According to this idea
the relative value of fossil remains consists only in the greater or less
distinctness with which that impress can be recognized. The accept-
ance of the theory of the evolutional development of organic forms
necessitates the rejection of this idea of the early geologists, which

ras one of the strongest influences in shaping their views of historical
geology, but as already intimated its adverse influence ts still observ-
able in the practice of certain modern authors, even though they may
theoretically disavow it.

Rejecting the idea of special endowment just referred to, we must
consider the relative chronological value of fossil remains with refer-
ence to thenatural laws which have produced their characteristics and
governed the various conditions of their origin. Much may profitably
be said concerning the comparative chronological value of the different
genera, families, etc., belonging to one and the same class of any
branch of either the animal or vegetable kingdom, or to different classes,
but I propose to discuss only the broader relations to one another of
the more general kinds of fossil remains. These discussions will re-
late to the time range of each of those general kinds, the various con-
ditions under which they have been preserved, the various conditions
of habitat of the animals and plants which they represent, the relative
rate of evolutional development of the different kinds and their differ-
ences of reciprocal relation to one another.

No fact in historical geology is more conspicuous than that of the
great differences in time range of the various kinds of organic forms,
some of them having ranged through the whole of the time represented
by the geological scale, while others, and among them some of the bio-
logically most important kinds, ranged through only a comparatively
small part of it.

The various conditions under which the different kinds of fossil re-

mains have been preserved is also of great importance in this connec-
tion. Some of them have been preserved only in marine deposits and
others only in nonmarine. Marine deposits have been continuous
through the whole of geological time, while nonmarine deposits are not
known among the older formations, and those which are known have
necessarily been isolated and have had little or no direct relation either
to one another or to marine deposits. The various conditions of habi-
tat of the animals and plants which have furnished fossil remains also
have much significance with reference to these discussions because of
their essential relation to the differences between the kinds and to their
differences of relation to one another.

It was shown in the preceding essay that while the general ad-
rancement in biological rank of organic forms which has occurred dur-
ing geological time constitutes the ultimate standard of measure for
that time, there has not been a uniform secular advancement for all
kinds, but that there has been much difference in the rate of evolu-
tional advancement for the various kinds of both animals and plants.
Again, the differences of reciprocal relation between the various kinds
of animals and plants which have furnished fossil remains are inti-
mately connected with the causes which have produced the differences
of chronological value of those remains. That is, certain kinds were
not only radically different from others, but they lived under such wide
differences of condition and were so nearly free from reciprocal rela-
tion to others, that they could not have produced a closely similar chro-
nological record.

The facts thus briefly stated are of themselves clearly suggestive of
the subject of this essay, that is, of wide difference in the relative
value of the different kinds of fossil remains as means of characterizing
the different stages of the geological scale and of determining the geo-
logical age of the strata in which they are found. These differences,
however, will be discussed at some length on the following pages, but
it is proper to say at the outset that while certain of the kinds men-
tioned are much more valuable for the purpose indicated than are
others, it is inexcusable in any geologist, in attempting to determine
the geological age of formations, to reject any kind as valueless, or to
fail to give due weight to every accessible relevant fact, whether bio-
logical or physical.

A special grouping of the different kinds of fossil remains is more
appropriate for these discussions than is a strictly systematic one, and
I have therefore adopted the following: (a) marine invertebrates, ())
nonmarine and land invertebrates, (c) fishes, (d) batrachians and rep-
tiles, (e) birds, (f) mammals, and (g) land plants. For convenience of
reference our present knowledge of the time-range of these kinds may
be presented in tabular form. The accompanying table, Plate xIv, rep-
resenting the whole of geological time by its height, indicates in a
general way by perpendicular lines the time range of the kinds just
304 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

mentioned, and remarks in following paragraphs further explain the
known range of some of the subordinate, as well as that of the princi-
pal kinds.

The horizontal spaces of the table represent the systems or stages of
the geological scale. The proportionate width of the spaces which
contain the names of those systems or stages is not intended to indi-

‘ate the actual ratio of geological time for each, but it may be stated
as the general opinion of competent investigators that the portion of
the scale from the Cambrian to the Carboniferous inclusive represents
a much greater length of time than does the portion from the Trias to
the Tertiary inclusive. In other words, it is generally believed that
the Paleozoic portion of the geological scale was of much longer dura-
tion than was that of the Mesozoic and Cenozoic portions together.

The perpendicular lines in the table, which are placed singly or in
pairs or groups under letters of the alphabet from A to G inclusive,
represent the time range of the kinds of animals and plants which *
have already been mentioned, and which for convenience of reference
are again recorded opposite corresponding letters at the foot of the
table. This method of grouping the different kinds of animals and
plants, as already intimated, is adopted only for present convenience
in making comparisons of chronological values. All the principal kinds
which are designated in the usual systematic classification are, how-
ever, included in these special groups, the few that are omitted being
regarded as of little or no importance in this connection. The dotted
portion of certain of the lines indicates uncertainty as to the real ex-
tent of the time range which is shown by them because of imperfect or
doubtful representation of those kinds by discovered fossil remains.

Of all the animals which have existed upon the earth whose remains
have been discovered only those of marine invertebrates have been
found to range through the whole geological scale. The time range of
these important portions of the animal kingdom is represented by the
eroup of five perpendicular lines under the letter A. The marine in-
vertebrate life thus represented includes the Protozoa, Coelenterata,
Annuloida, Annulosa, and Mollusea, the latter including the Mollus-
coida. That is, it includes five of the six subkingdoms or branches of
the aninal kingdom.

~The nonmarine and land invertebrates whose time range is intended
to be represented in the table by the two perpendicular lines under the
letter B are only insects and fresh-water, brackish-water, and land
mollusks. The discovered fossil remains of all other nonmarine and
land invertebrates are regarded as either too rare or too unimportant to
be profitably considered in the comparisons which are to follow. The
longer of the two lines may be taken as representing the known time
range of insects and the shorter that of land and nonmarine mollusea.

The pair of perpendicular lines in the table under the letter C shows

the approximate time range of all the various kinds of animal remains
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 305

~which have been referred to the fishes. The shorter of the two lines in-
dicates the known range of the teliost fishes and the longer which of
the other kinds, the latter including certain forms that differ materially
from any living fishes.

The time range of Batrachians and reptiles, so far as it is known, is
shown by the three perpendicular lines in the table under the letter D,
that of the dinosaurs alone being represented by the shortest line of
the three.

The known time range of birds is represented by the single line under
the letter KE. It is here assumed that most, if not all, the fossil tracks
found in Triassic strata and formerly referred to birds are those of
dinosaurs.

The two lines in the table under the letter F represent the known
time range of mammals, the longer line representing that of the non-
placental and the shorter that of the placental mammals.

The known time range of land plants is represented by the two lines
under the letter G. The shorter line represents the range of the dicoty-
ledons and palms and the longer one that of all other kinds. The alge
and diatoms are omitted from the table as being of little or no impor-
tance in the comparisons and discussions which are to follow.

The earlier portion of the time-range for each of the kinds of animals
and plants as shown bythe perpendicular lines in the table is naturally
more incompletely and indefinitely represented by fossil remains than
is the later portion, because of the smaller variety and greater rarity of
those earlier remains and also in most cases because of the increasing
difference in character from living forms which is observable from later
to earlier formations. In sume cases, however, the early portion of the
time range as if is now known begins so suddenly and with forms of
such high biological rank as to make it evident that its real beginning
was mucn earlier than it aas yet been proved to be by aetual discovery
of fossil remains. Lhe tast-mentioned fact is of great importance in
many respects, but 1 does not necessarily affect the question under
consideration, because all estimates of the relative chronological value
of fossil remains must be contined to the kinds already known, and the
application of such estimates must be confined to those portions of the
geological scale in the strata pertaining to which the remains are
known to oceur.

Although much the greater part of all the known fossil remains of
the earth are of marine origin, it 1s a significant tact that most of the
general kinds represented in the table are either of noumarine or land
origin. The extreme diversity ot these conditions of habitat implies a
wide diversity of character and suggests a wide difference of values.
It is this diversity which makes it necessary to discuss the different
kinds of tossil remaims with reference to both habitat and conditions
of preservation.

306 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

While a greater or less number of other kinds of anunals, such as the
Cetacea, Sirenia, birds, reptiles, etc., resort to or live in marine waters,
only invertebrates and fishes have marine aqueous respiration. It is
therefore evident that with the forementioned exceptions, together with
that of their ancient representatives, these kinds of animals only have
ever been denizens of marine waters, and it is also evident that with
the exception of a few migratory kinds the remains of denizens of.
marine waters found intombment in no other than marine sedimentary
deposits.

The character of the physiological functions of all the other animals
which are represented by fossil remains made them denizens either of
the land or of nonmarine waters. In view of this fact and of others
which have been mentioned in Essay 1, it is apparent that with few
and mostly accidental exceptions their remains became fossilized only
in nonmarine sedimentary deposits.

The land in the vicinity of inland bodies of water naturally consti-
tuted a more congenial habitat for such plants as have in part become
fossilized than did open seacoasts, and, as shown in Essay 1, plant re-
mains were much more likely to have become preserved in nonmarine
than in marine sediments, This statement is supported by the fact that,
with rare exceptions, all discovered plant remains, especially such as are
preserved in a classifiable condition, are found in nonmarine deposits,
which are shown to be such by the character of the accompanying re-
mains of aquatic faunas. Among the apparent exceptions to this rule
are the beds of coal, and of shale containing plant remains, which are
found to alternate with other beds bearing remains of unmistakably
marine animals. These cases, however, are regarded as representing
alternate subsidence and slight emergence of marshy land with relation
to the level of shallow marine waters. Such conditions are accordant
with the forementioned alternation of the remains of land plants with
those of marine animals, and also with the fact that the actual com-
mingling in one and the same bed of the two kinds of remains has very
rarely been discovered.

The foregoing facts make it evident that as a rule, having only the
exceptions just indicated, strata of marine origin contain no other fos-
sil remains than those of invertebrates and fishes. It should also be
remarked in this connection that fish remains are often absent from
strata that contain invertebrate remains in great abundance, and that
in all other cases the proportion of the former to the latter is very small
as regards both numbers and variety—that is, as a rule, fish remains
are comparatively so rare that a large proportion of the marine forma-
tions are found to contain no other fossil remains than those of inver-
tebrates. Those facts also make it evident that with few and compar-
atively unimportant exceptions the remains of all land animals, as well
as those of all land plants, are found only in sedimentary deposits of
nommarine origin.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 307

By referring to the table on Plate xtv it will be seen that the time
range of none of the nonmarine kinds of fossil remains extends much
beyond the estimated later half of geological time, and that the range
of a part of them is much less. It will also be observed that the time.
range of marine invertebrates is from the beginning to the end of the
time represented by the geological scale. Therefore, there is no possi-
bility of making comparisons between remains of marine animals and
those of all other animals as well as those of land plants for a very
large early part of the geological scale, because none of the latter kinds
have been discovered there. Indeed, opportunities for any such com-
parisons tor the whole Paleozoic portion of the scale, besides those
which are practicable between remains of the marine animals and those
of the Jand plants of the Carboniferous system, are very few and com-
paratively unimportant. It is probable that many and important non-
marine deposits were formed during Paleozoic time and that they con-
tained the remains of nonmarine faunas, but reference is here made
only to the present extent of our knowledge in that direction.

For the Mesozoic and Cenozoic portions of the geological scale oppor-
tunities are much more numerous for comparing fossil remains of ma-
rine with those of nonmarine origin than they are for the Paleozoie
portion. This is because nonmarine formations are of more frequent
occurrence among the sedimentary rocks of the two later eras than
among those of Paleozoic era, and also because of the greater abun-
dance and variety of the remains of nonmarine and land faunas and of
land floras ii those later formations. It is, however, a fact of great
importance in this connection that the aggregate proportion of non-
marine formations to those of Inarine origin, even for the Mesozoic and
Cenozoic portions of the scale, is very small.

It is thus apparent that for the Paleozoie portion of the seale it is
marine formatious almost exclusively with which the geologist has to
deal, and that for the remainder of the scale marine formations are far
in excess of the nonmarine. Indeed, they are so far in excess that,
with the exception of a few regions like the interior portion of North
America, for example, the occurrence of nonmarine formations is quite
exceptional.

The absence of marine deposits among the formations of the earlier
part of the geological scale and the great excess of the marine over
the nonmarine among those of the later part, even where the latter
are most abundant, is a great impediment to the comparisons which it
is desirable to make between them and their fossil contents respectively.
Still, this is not a greater impediment to such comparisons than is the
incongruity or want of reciprocal relation not only between the marine
and nonmarine, but between the different kinds of the latter.*

*Dr. Theodore Gill has clearly pointed ont the incongruity between land and
marine faunas from the standpoint of recent biology. See Proc. Biolog. Soc., Wash-
ington, Vol. 2, p. 32, 1885; and The Nation, Vol. 24, p. 43, 1877.
308 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

The physical incongruity between marine and noumarine formations
is manifest in the fact that the presence of one or more of the latter
in a series of the former kind of formations always implies that there
have been such disturbances of physical conditions as to cause at least
“alocal break in the continuity of marine sedimentation as well as in
that of faunal succession. Such breaks also imply a greater or less
interruption of the chronological record, the extent and character of
which can be determined, if at all, only by indirect means. It is, how-
ever, the want of reciprocal relation between marine faunas on the one
hand and nonmarine and land faunas and land floras on the other that
more concerns the question of the relative value of the different kinds
of fossil remains in characterizing the time divisions of the geological
scale than does a similar want with reference to other kinds.

The biological contrast between marine faunas and land floras and
between their respective conditions of existence is so complete that it
is unreasonable to assume that the evolutional changes which have
taken place in each during geological time were chronologically concur-
rent. Therefore, whatever of intrinsic value in the characterization
of the divisions of the scale the fossil remains of the one series may
possess, it is quite independent of that of the other.

Itis true that the biological contrast between marine faunas and
land faunas is not so complete as 16 is between marine faunas and land
floras, but as regards interdependence and common conditions of ex-
istence the want of reciprocal relation between marine faunas and a
large proportion of the members of all the land faunas is well nigh
complete. Real or appareat exceptions to such completeness are ob-
servablein the exclusively marine habitat, or marine resort for subsist-
ence, of certain tmammals, reptiles, and birds, but these are cases of
adaptation to conditions which ave abnormal or exceptional for the
respective classes to which they belong.

Notwithstanding these exceptions it is evident that during geological
time there has been no necessary concurrence of rate or degree of pro-
gressive evolution between marine and land faunas, and therefore that
the chronological value of the one series of faunas has in no case a
necessary relation to that of the other, or no other than a common seec-
war relation,* which is at best obscure.

The relation of the marine to the nonmarine aquatic faunas is less
incongruous than it is in the case of the land faunas already noticed,
the respective members of nonmarine faunas having much in common
with corresponding members of marine faunas as regards zoological
attinity. Such a relation, however, does not make nonmarine fossil
faunas of concurrent chronological value with the marine, because of
the conspicuous fact that the rate of both progressive and differential
evolution has been remarkably slow in the case of nonmarine, especially

©The difficulty or impossibility of correlating marine deposits with those of non-
marine origin is discussed at the close of Essay v1.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 309

fresh-water, faunas. Among illustrations of this tardiness of evolution
may be mentioned the close similarity to one another of the Jurassic,
Cretaceous, Tertiary, and recent fresh-water molluscan faunas, and also
the fact that much the greater part of the ancient ichthyie types which
have survived to the present day are found among the fresh-water fishes.

The foregoing comparisons have been made between marine faunas
cn the one hand and all other faunas and the land floras on the other.
When we come to compare the various kinds of land animals with one
another, and with land plants, we find that while reciprocal biological
relation between them 1s more or less intimate in certain respects, there
is no such relation as would necessarily have produced a coneurrent
rate of progressive evolution in all of them. On the contrary, when we
come to examine the fossil land faunas and floras we find that there has
been a great difference among them as to the rate of progressive evo-
lution for each, and also a marked difference in the relative extent of
differential evolution.

For example, the earliest known dinosaurs were introduced before
the earliest known dicotyledonous plants. The former, after a wonder-
fully differentiated development, became extinct, together with the
enaliosaurs, about the time of the introduction of the earliest known
of the placental mammals. Other reptilian families, and even closely
related genera, which were contemporary with the dinosaurs and enal-
iosaurs, have survived to the present day. Long before the extinetion
of the dinosaurs, and before the introduction of the earliest known pla-
cental mammals, a dicotyledonous flora prevailed, composed largely of
families which are well represented by living plants, several of which
families contain genera that are common among living floras.*

Up to the close of the Cretaceous the general rate of progressive
evolution of land plants was, as shown in the preceding essay, more
rapid for North America than for Europe; but it was afterward much
less rapid on this continent than was that of the contemporary placen-
tal maminals.

For the time that the dinosaurs are known to have existed their rate
of progressive evolution was very slow and their differential evolution
very great. That is, while their differential evolution resulted in an
infinite variety of forms and their adaptation to the greatest extremes
in methods of locomotion and of dietetic subsistence, the average bio-
logical rank of the Jurassic and Cretaceous dinosaurs seems not to have
been appreciably higher than is that of their Triassie predecessors.
Indeed, it is an admitted fact that many of the latest known North
American dinosaurs have strong Jurassic affinities; and it may also be
remarked that the affinities of their associated nonplacental mamma-
lian remains are similar in this respect.

“All these comparisons are made with special reference to North American paleon
tology.
310 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Two extremes of rate of evolution are exemplified by the fresh-water
mollusea on the one hand and the placental mammaJs on the other.
The evolution of the former has been slower than that of any other
animals of equal biological rank, and the evolution of the latter more
rapid than that of any others, even among their contemporary forms
of life.

Applying the foregoing statements to the methods which have been
adopted in the construction of the geological scale and in the recogni-
tion of its divisions, we observe that for the portion which may reason-
ably be assumed to represent fully the first half of geological time the
work has been accomplished entirely by means of marine invertebrate
fossils. These only were available for that purpose, but they were
sufficient. We further find that the remainder of the Paleozoic portion
of the scale was constructed by means of marine invertebrate remains
with only the auxiliary aid of plant and fish remains. The latter aid
was hot really necessary, because the succession and completeness of
Paleozoic marine life was unbroken, and the remains which those forms
of life afforded constitute of themselves abundant material for charac-
terizing consecutive divisions of the seale.

The opinion formerly prevailed among geologists that at the close of
Paleozoic time there was a material and general break in the succes-
sion of marine life coincident with that which was assumed to have
taken place in the case of land plants, and which was also assumed to
have been at least approximately coincident with the introduction of
dinosaurs, birds, and nonplacental mammals.

It is now known, however, that the succession of marine invertebrate
life was as complete from Paleozoic to Mesozoic time and from Mesozoic
to Cenozoic time as it was for any other portions of the geclogical scale.
Furthermore the remains of Mesozoic and Cenozoic marine inverte-
brates are as sufficient for the characterization of those divisions of
the scale as are remains of marine invertebrates for the Paleozoic por-
tion.

It is thus apparent that there has been a continuous and fill succes-
sion of marine invertebrate life through the whole time range of the geo-
logical scale, and that its remains are as sufficient as any fossil remains
can be for the characterization of every one of its divisions wherever
they are represented by fossiliferous rocks of marine origin. Further-
more, from the beginning to the end of geological time, there has been
a good degree of uniformity of the rate of development of marine inver-
tebrates, and the reciprocal relation of the various kinds to one another,
so far as concerns its bearing upon geological questions, has always
been intimate and of a comparatively uniform character. Therefore, the
paleontological record which they have produced is to a great degree
complete in itself and harmonious in all its parts.

On the other hand it is apparent that the longest known time range
of the fossil remains of any of the other kinds of animals or of land
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 311

plants falls very far short of the full range of the scale, while the range
of each of the more important of these kinds is at best through only a
portion of the later half of the scale. Besides this, the incongruity
which has been shown to have existed between the different kinds of
these nonmarine and land animals and land plants respectively, and the
difference in the rate of evolution of each, were such that their respee-
tive time ranges could not have been so complemental of one another
as to constitute of themselves a consecutive and harmonious paleonto-
logical record for that portion of the geological scale in which they oc-
eur. At least a record thus produced could not have been so complete
as is that which has been produced for the whole scale by the combined
ranges of the different kinds of marine invertebrates.

If the fossil remains of the nonmarine and Jand faunas and land
floras can not be used conjointly as a standard for the characterization
and recognition of the divisions of the geological scale it is evident
that none of the kinds which they embrace can be separately so used.
It has been claimed by some authors that, although their complexity of
structure was the predisposing cause, the exciting cause of the re-
markably rapid progressive, and the wide differential, evolution of the
placental mammals was their sensitiveness to physical changes which
were so slight that they produced little or no effect upon associated
faunas. They further claim that this sensitiveness to slight physical
changes has made the remains of those animals more valuable as indi-
cators of the divisions of geological time than are any other fossil
remains.

Whatever may have been the cause of the rapid changes which took
place among those mammals it is true that their remains are often
valuable for distinguishing subordinate horizons which other fossils do
not clearly indicate. It is plain, however, that a chronological classi-
fication based upon such rapidly changing forms alone will not har-
monize with that which we are obliged to use for all that great earlier
portion of the scale in the strata of which such remains do not oceur,
nor with the continuation of that classification which is necessarily
used for the remaining portion of the seale.

If the remains which the placental mammals have left had shown
any such approach to a direct succession of faunas as have the marine,
and especially the nonmarine, invertebrates they would be much more
valuable in the way just mentioned than they are now found to be. That
is, there are great faunal breaks among themselves so far as their sue-
cession is known, and an especially wide faunal hiatus between the ear-
liest of them and the nonplacental mammals and the dinosaurs which
preceded them, while the known succession or continuous existence of
species of gill-bearing mollusks show that the stratigraphic record is
continuous.

For example, certain species of gill-bearing fresh water mollusks are
found associated with dinosaurian remains in the interior region of
312 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

North America, and the same species have been found in an overlying
formation which is characterized by an abundant placental mammalian
fauna. Such a survival! of gill-bearing mollusks implies the continua-
tion of a congenial aquatic habitat, continuous sedimentation, and a
continuous record of time. In this way specific molluscan forms are
found to have bridged the gap between characteristic mesozoic, and
equally characteristic cenozoie vertebrate forms so far as the existence
of the latter has been proved by the discovery of fossil remains. — It is,
therefore, evident that neither the exceptionally rapid rate of evolution
like that of the placental mammals, nor the exceptionally slow rate,
like that of the fresh water mollusca, can be used independently as a
standard of geological time.

It has been shown on preceding pages that it is the general advance-
ment in biological rank for all organic forms and for the whole of geo-
logical time that constitutes the ideal ultimate standard of measure
for that time. It does not necessarily follow, however, that the geo-
logical scale is actually based upon the combined average rate of
advancement of all those forms because this is a factor which can not
be definitely ascertained. Still, in all cases it is necessary to apply
that idea so far as is practicable.

In view of the facets recorded in the preceding paragraphs we must
necessarily place the highest estimate of chronological value upon the
fossil remains of those kinds which have existed under the most nearly
uniform conditions through the whole of geological time, and which
give evidence of the most nearly uniform advancement in biological
rank. Accordingly the remains of marine invertebrates possess legit-
imate claims to a higher estimate of chronological value than do those
of any other kinds of animals or of plants.

It is true that the rate of development in biological rank of marine
invertebrates does not embrace the entire advance for the whole animal
kingdom because it begins in the scale as it is now known with many
highly organized forms and ends without including the vertebrates,
‘but this fact does not affect any of the necessary elements of their
superior chronological value which have just been mentioned. The fol-
lowing summary of facts relating to the marine invertebrates show their
principal claims to the highest estimate of value in characterizing the
divisions of the geological scale and in determining the geological age
of the strata in which their remains are found.

The marine invertebrates embrace five of the six subkingdoms or
branches of the animal kingdom.

They have coexisted in every stage of geological time while the
known time-range of other animals, as well as of land plants, has been
very much less.

The preservation of their remains having been a natural consequence
of the character of their habitat they are faunally more complete than
are those of any land animals, and for the same reason they are florally
more complete than are remains of land plants.
RELATION OI? BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. . alias

They all lived under the same or closely similar conditions, and those
conditions were more nearly uniform throughout all geological time
than were those under which any other forms of life existed. Their
remains have, therefore, produced a more nearly uniform chronological
record.

Their relations to one another were wholly congruous, while the rela-
tions of all of them to all nonmarine faunas and land floras was more
or less incongruous, and in many cases extremely so.

The formations containing their remains are for the whole world and
the whole of the geological scale far in excess of those which contain
the remains of any other forms of life, especially the remains of land
plants and land animals.

VI.—CORRELATIVE GEOLOGY AND ITS CRITERIA.

The term correlative geology is not in common use but if is adopted
as a present convenience in discussing the correlation of assemblages
of strata as divisions or subdivisions of the geological scale as it is
developed in separate regions, and the identification of formations
within one and the same district or region. As here used the term
correlation refers to geological systems or other comprehensive series
of stratified rocks which occur in different and more or less widely sep-
arated parts of the world between which parts there is no physical
continuity of strata, or none that it is possible to discover. Correla-
tion applies to general geology, identification to local or regional inves-
tigations.

The latter may be discussed under two heads, direct and relative.
Direct identification applies to formations the characteristics of which
at one or more localities have been ascertained, and as these are
naturally of limited geographical extent* the application is similarly
restricted.

If a formation were exposed at the surface throughout its whole
geographical extent its identity at all points would be self-evident, but
all formations being more or less covered from view by one another or
by surface débris, they are usually accessible for study only where
they have been corraded by drainage streams or brought to the sur-
face by movements of the earth’s crust where their exposure has
been effected by subaerial erosion and denudation. It is at such
localities only that they can be satisfactorily identified, but such iden-
tification implies the actual or original continuity of the formation
between all the localities at which the identification has been made.

It is the identification of formations and not their characterization
which is here discussed, The latter, as indicated in Essay 11, must be
determined by original studies at one or more localities from a variety
of data, chief among which are the biological, although the physical
are always indispensable, while identification refers to a recognition of
those characteristics else where.

Specific identity of fossils affords the surest test of the direct identity
of a formation at localities between which its physical continuity can
not be traced, but lithological similarity, general evidence of homogeny
and other physical indications are often efficient aids in such identifica-
tion, and in case of failure of biological evidence they are often in a
good degree satisfactory.

By the term relative identification is meant the recognition of the

and the characterization which are given in Essay I.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 315

which has been determined by the previous study of formations which
have been directly identified. Therefore, while direct itlentification is
confined to the geological limits of separate formations, relative identi-
fication may extend throughout a large region by the overlapping of
formations. Such a recognition of the taxonomic position of formations
is usually the direct result of empirical study of a given series within a
limited region, but it is often the result of those philosophical studies
which have been made in connection with the construction of the great
geological scale, especially in cases where a wide time-hiatus exists
between formations.* The latter, however, approaches correlation in
character. :

Identification, except in the relative cases just mentioned, is always the
result of empirical studies; but correlation is more philosophically deter-
mined. The latter not only implies the existence of closely similar
biological characteristics in systems or series of formations in different
and widely separated parts of the world, but in each case it has refer-
ence to a Similarity of relation to preceding and succeeding series of
formations respectively. That is, correlation relates to the serial recog-
nition of the various divisions of the geological scale in more or less
widely separated parts of the world, and is based wholly upon biology,
those divisions coinciding with stages in the evolutional progress of
development of organic forms which has occurred during geological
time.

In the practical study of the structural geology of a region the prin-
cipal use of correlation is to apply universally acceptable names to the
different groups of formation. That is, the structural geology of great
regions, or even of the greater part if not the whole of continents, may
be minutely and comprehensively studied and all the stratified rocks
accurately classified in chronological order by means of direct and rela-
tive identification of formations and without necessary reference to
their correlation with those of any other part of the world except as a
means of detecting such cases of wide time-hiatus between formations
as are not otherwise clearly revealed.

Because fossil remains constitute the principal criteria in the practi-
cal identification of formations it is desirable in this connection to con-
sider the relative value of the different kinds for this purpose, although
the subject has been briefly discussed and frequently referred to in
the preceding essays.

Fossils being the remains of animals and plants most of the prinei-
pal kinds of which lived under different physical conditions, some of
them have a more direct relation than others to the formations in
which they are found. Therefore they differ materially as to their

*“What I have here designated as relative identification has often been by authors
included under the head of correlation, I also have done so in Bulletin U. 8. Geo-
logical Survey, No. 82, pp 17-25, but the more clearly to state the principles involved

o16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

relative value in the identification of formations. Naturally the re-
mains of aquatic faunas exceed all others in value for this purpose
because the faunas not only found a congenial habitat in the waters
in which were deposited the formations that now contain their fossil
remains, but they could have existed in no other. Their whole life
history, with the minor exception of migratory fishes, especially such
as entered nonmarine waters, was therefore intimately and wholly con-
nected with the production of those formations.

A large proportion of all the formations which are characterized by
the remains of aquatic faunas contain none of land faunas and floras,
but in other formations remains of the latter kind are found com-
mingled with those of aquatic faunas. In all such cases the remains
of Jand faunas and floras reached their intombment by accidental
means while the intombment of the remains of aquatic faunas was a
natural result of the character of their habitat. Moreover, all the mem.
bers of extinct aquatic faunas which possessed fossilizable parts are
likely to have been represented by fossil remains, because in their in-
tombment they were not separated from their habitat, while the intomb-
ment of all remains of land faunas and floras was not enly accidental
but necessarily partial as regards the faunas and floras from which
they were derived.*

Again, the existence of every extinct aquatic fauna had not only an
intimate connection with the conditions which produced the formation
in which the remains are found, but it began its existence as a fauna
with the establishment of those conditions and was extinguished as
such when the conditions were changed, and largely or wholly in conse-
quence of the change. It might easily, and evidently often did, happen
that changes of physical conditions which caused the extinetion of one
aquatic fauna and the introduction of a succeeding one would not mate-
rially affect the continued existence of the fauna and flora of the adja-
cent land which were contemporary with the extinguished fauna. In
such a ease the land fauna or flora began its existence before, or con-
tinued it after, that of the aquatic fauna, or its existence may have
extended continuously from the epoch before to that after the one in
whéch the aquatic fauna lived. In such a case also. while the aquatic
fauna was characteristic of only one formation and one epoch, the land
fauna and flora may have characterized two or three formations and as
many epochs. Furthermore, geologists sometimes find evidence from
the association of their remains with those of aquatic faunas that land
faunas and floras were repeatedly and materially changed during a
period within which aquatie faunas of the same region suffered com-
paratively little change.

It is true, as mentioned in those paragraphs of essay II, in which
methods ot defining and characterizing formations are discussed, that

“See pages 254-261.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 317

fossil remains of certain kinds of land animals and plants may be and
often are found only within the limits of a given formation, and in that
respect they may be regarded as characteristic of it; but that does not
atfect the accuracy of the foregoing statements.

The foregoing comparisons of the relative value of fossil remains of
aquatic and terrestrial animals can not be of unlimited application be-
cause no remains of terrestrial animals have been found in the forma-
tions of the earlier geological periods, and it is generally believed that
none existed then. Indeed, such comparisons are of little applicability
in the case of any formations earlier than the Mesozoic, and they mainly
pertain to the Cenozoic. i

The facts mentioned in the foregoing paragraphs have far-reaching
significance other than that which directly relates to the identification
of formations. They are to be again mentioned, but only for the pur-
pose of showing that whatever of value fossil remains of land animals
and plants may possess other than that which has been referred to,
they are, as a rule, of much less value in identifying and characterizing
formations than are those of aquatic animals.

Marine waters having always been of world-wide extent, and marine
conditions more nearly uniform or subject to far less vicissitude than
either nonmarine or terrestrial conditions, the fossil remains of the
marine faunas naturally constitute a better medium for a continous
chronological record by organic evolution than do those of terrestrial
faunas and floras or those of fresh-water faunas. This fact, however,
does not make the fossil remains of fresh-water faunas any less trust-
worthy than are those of marine faunas for the identification of the
formations which they characterize.*

With the exception of fishes and a few mammals and reptiles verte-
brates of the kinds whose remains are available in geological studies
are mostly land animals, while those of invertebrates of the kinds whose
remains are thus available are mostly aquatic animals. The superior
value of the latter has already been pointed out; butit should be added
that remains of fishes, in case of equally complete faunal representation,
are of no less value than are those of aquatic invertebrates. The migra-
tory habits of a greater or less proportion of fishes, however, has in
some cases caused their remains to be commingled with those of more
than one fauna and to be deposited in more than one formation.

The remains of other vertebrate aquatic animals are sometimes avail-
able in the identification of formations, but they are generally of less
value than are the remains of fishes, because the aerial respiration and
amphibious habits of most of them generally restricted their range within
narrower limits. Furthermore, their range in geological time is even
less extended than that of fishes. That is, air-breathing vertebrates
are not yet known to have existed earlier than the Carboniferous, and

* Por discussions of this subject see pages 281-283.
318 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

during that age they were comparatively unimportant. Although-fishes
existed earlier than other vertebrates, their remains aftord little material
for comparison with those of invertebrates in earlier rocks than those
of Devonian age. Therefore the identification of all those earlier forma-
tions, comprising a large part of the whole geological series, must be
made by means of invertebrate remains alone.

When considering the relative value of fossil remains of animals and
plants in the identification of formations, only terrestrial plants* are
worthy of notice, because of the low grade of aquatic plants proper, and
because our definite knowledge of terrestrial plants extends no farther
back in geological time than the Devonian. Furthermore, their remains
being very rare in rocks of that age, a satisfactory comparison of plant
remains with those of animals is necessarily restricted to formations of
the Carboniferous and iater ages.

Again, the disparity of value between the remains of aquatic and
terrestrial faunas, which has already been mentioned, is not only
equally great between those aquatic faunas and land floras, but for
reasons stated in Essay tr plant remains in all cases much less com-
pletely represent the floras from which they were derived than do the
remains of aquatic animals the faunas in which they originated.

From the foregoing statements it is seen that, although fossils in all
tases constitute not only much the most, but usually the only, trust-
worthy criteria for such identification of formations as is indispensable
in the study of structural geology, the various kinds differ materially
as to their relative value. This value, however, has no necessary rela-
tion to that which they may possess as indicators of geological time or
of the correlation of the strata containing them with those of other
parts of the world. The two values are distinct, although one kind of
fossil remains may often possess both.

Other criteria of identification than those of fossil remains were
briefly referred to in a preceding paragraph as being chiefly homogeny
and lithological similarity, both of which are valuable aids when pale-
ontological criteria are deficient, and both may often be relied upon in

sases of the absence of those criteria. Except in the more or less con-
stant use of lithological characteristics, that ought always to be made
in connection with the biological identification of formations, those
characteristics are at best of limited applicability as criteria, and they
are available only in either direct or indirect relation to biological eri-
teria. Their indirect availability is that which has just been referred
to. Their direct availability is mainly in connection with what in a
preceding paragraph has been designated as relative identification, be-
cause it can be made only with reference to some one or more of already
known biological horizons.

Sometimes the relative stratigraphical position of a single unfossilifer-
ous sedimentary formation may be determined by means of its relation to

~ Palustral plants are included in this designation.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 319

those which underlie and overlie it and which have been biologically
identified, or the relative age of a formation of volcanic origin intercalated
between known fossiliferous formations may be thus determined. Again,
there may be a great series of unfossiliferous stratified rocks, such as is
the pre-Cambrian, the divisions of which are identifiable by means of
lithological criteria aided by the general evidence of homogeny.

In the case of single unfossiliferous sedimentary formations such as
have just been referred to, their relative identity is determinable by the
underlying and overlying fossiliferous formations. The same is true in
case of the formations of voleanie origin which have also been referred
to, the claim formerly made that the geological age of this kind of rocks
can be determined by the mineral composition having been generally
abandoned. The geological age of the pre-Cambrian formations also
have not been determined by any inherent evidence, but only by their
ascertained stratigraphic relation to the fossiliferous Cambrian rocks.
That is, their geological age or relative identification could be ascer-
tained only by reterence to biological criteria.

While fossil remains unquestionably afford the most trustworthy and
often the only means of either direct or indirect identification of forma-
tions, in the absence of these means the geologist often reaches conclu-
sions in this respect by methods of reasoning that it would be difficult
even for himself to formulate, and these conclusions are valuable in
proportion to hisacquirements and experience. Among these less clearly
definable methods is that which takes cognizance of homogeny; that
is, of a method in connection with which certain inherent lithological
and stratigraphical characteristics, which are possessed by a formation
or series of strata in one part of a given region under investigation, are
accepted as evidence that it had a common origin with a formation or
series presenting similar characteristics in another part of the same
region. Such aconclusion necessarily implies that originally there was
physical continuity of similar strata between such localities, and that it
has either been destroyed or obscured.

This method of identifymg formations is one of minor importance as
compared with that which is based upon fossil remains, but unfortu-
nately it has, especially within the last few years, been adopted by cer-
tain geologists in charge of important works almost to the entire exclu-
sion of paleontological considerations. Although it can not be denied
that in the hands of an experienced and broad-minded investigator this
method of identifying formations is of great value, the fact remains that
some of the most grievous mistakes that have ever thrown discredit
upon geological investigation have occurred by its adoption to the
exclusion of paleontological evidence.

The term correlation, as restricted by the preceding definition and
distinguished from identification, is applied to a comparison of the
stages and substages of the geological scale as they are respectively
recognizable in distinctly separate regions. Such regions as are referred
320 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

to are now separated from one another by intervening broad bodies of
water beneath which there may or may not have ever been strati-
graphical continuity, or by terrestrial conditions which have made it
impossible to trace such continuity if it ever existed.

Thus, while correlation in this restricted sense is usually confined to
a comparison of great series of stratified rocks as they occur on sepa-
rate continents, it is sometimes quite as applicable to different parts of
one and the same continent as is the case, for example, with the east-
ern and western portions of North America.

In considering the subject of correlation as thus restricted, we find
that it not only depends quite as fully upon the study of fossil remains
as does the identification of formations, but having reference to regions
too distinctly separate from one another to have recognizable strati-
graphical continuity between them, such questions as those pertaining
to physical characteristics and identity are eliminated. We also find
that the manner of dependence upon fossil remains in the two classes
of cases is different; that is, in the one case it is mainly specific iden-
tification that is relied upon, and in the other reliance is placed only
upon the recognition of various general faunal and floral types, such as
are referred to on pages 296-300.

As was stated in Essay I, formations being physical units of local,
but not universal, stratigraphic classification, the term identification is
especially appropriate when referring to studies of their relation to one
another in the field. The determination of correlation is also in some
sense an act of identification; that is, it is the identification, or, more
properly speaking, the recognition of the divisions or subdivisions of
the great geological scale in different and distinctly separate parts of
the world, The fact that the divisions and subdivisions of the scale
may thus be more or less completely recognized being fully admitted
by all geologists, the only question that need be discussed in that con-
nection relates to the manner of their characterization, the distinetness
of their limitation, the completeness of their representation, and to
synehronism or Gontemporaneity and homotaxy.

The idea of correlation presupposes astandard, and as every standard
must be either absolute or conventional it is necessary to consider what
must be the character of one by which correlation as herein defined
may be recognized, because upon this depends an intelligible discussion
of the subiect. If the standard of correlation is an absolute one, there
can be no question as to the definiteness and completeness of its appli-
cability in all cases and in all parts of the world where the necessary
observations can be made. If, however, the standard is a conventional
one, its recognition as such implies more or less uncertainty as to the
definiteness and completeness of its universal applicability, but a con-
ventional standard may be based upon such an array of admissible facts
that in all cases where those facts are recognizable uncertainty and
indetiniteness in its practical application are reduced to comparatively
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 321

narrow limits. This, briefly, is my conception of the true character of
the only standard of correlation that may legitimately be used, because
it is the only one that agrees with a rational interpretation of natural
laws.

It has, however, been the custoin of a large proportion of geologists
to regard the geological scale as it has been established in Europe as
the absolute standard for the whole earth. A necessary consequence
of this view is their assumption that the systems which physically eon-
stitute that scale, and at least most of the divisions of those systems,
may not only be recognized, but as clearly defined in all parts of the
earth as they are in Europe, if in those parts contemporaneous deposits
were made and still remain intact.

While fully accepting the fact of the existence of a rational standard
of correlation and of its great practical value, it is my purpose to oppose
the idea of its absoluteness which is still entertained by many geolo-
gists, and which was formerly entertained by all. Before proceeding
with those remarks, however, it is desirable to inquire briefly as to the
origin of that idea and the probable reason of its survival, and to refer
to other ideas which were entertained by the early geologists but which
have long been abandoned.

One of the abandoned ideas referred to relates to the recognition of
lithological identity as a criterion of correlation. This idea is indicated
in various ways by.the writings of those early authors and to some
extent by their application of names to the divisions of the scale—such,
for example, as Old Red Sandstone and New Red Sandstone* for the
Devonian and Triassic systems, respectively. Another relates to the
degree of consolidation or compactness that sedimentary rocks have
acquired, and still another to the degree of general disturbance which
they have suffered. As already stated, those pioneers regarded these
conditions as indicating relative age and also as being an aid to litho-
logical identification as a criterion of correlation.

These ideas were abandoned because they were found to be untenable
even from the standpoint of their originators, and yet they are scarcely
less rational than is that which ascribes absoluteness te the European
scale as a standard of correlation. The only cause that [I can suggest
for the survival of the latter idea while the former ideas have been
abandoned is a general conservative disinclination of the mind to adjust
itself to new methods of thought, especially if the old methods have
been rendered plausible by artificial adjustment to indisputable facts,
and are intricate by the complex nature of the subject. The idea of
the chronological value in the study of systematic geology of litholog-
ical character and conditions seems to have been abandoned not ouly
because it was fallacious but because the portion of the subject te

~The Permian was by the early geologists sometimes included with the Triassic
under the name New Red Sandstone.

322 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

which it pertains not being complex the idea was readily dismissed.
The idea of the absoluteness of the geological scale now in general use
as a Standard for the whole earth pertains to an unusually complex
subject, involving various concurrent lines of systematic thought. It
was probably for this reason that it was not fully dislodged even by
the great biological revolution which has been referred to in the last
essay, notwithstanding the fact that its subject is essentially a bio-
logical one.

Originally the idea of correlation involved that of actual and com-
plete contemporaneity. That is, in accordance with their belief in
special creations the early geologists assumed that every faunal and
floral type, as well as every species, having been specially created* each
one of those types which characterize any given stage or substage of
the geological scale was simultaneously deposited. They also believed
that all the divisions and subdivisions of the geological scale were
divinely ordained and sharply definable, and their acceptance of that
seale as an absolute universal standard of correlation was a necessary
result of that belief. Notwithstanding the great revolution in methods
of biological thought and practice which has been referred to, paleon-
tological literature abounds with proof that the idea of absoluteness of
correlation is still held even by authors who ostensibly reject all the
beliefs which alone could have given origin to such an idea.

Sufficient reasons have been given why formations as such can not
be considered in discussing correlation, but I again refer to the fact for
the purpose of emphasizing the statements that true correlation is es-
sentially a biological and not a physical matter, that its application is
necessarily restricted to divisions of the geological scale that are more
comprehensive than those which may be represented by even the great-
est of the formations as they are defined in Essay 11, and that in the
determination of such correlation specific identity of fossils can rarely
be considered. It is therefore necessary to consider what divisions of
the scale may be satisfactorily correlated and what are the character
and attributes of the biological forms that constitute the criteria of
their correlation.

Naturally the larger divisions-of the scale are more readily recogniz-
‘able than are the smaller, because, besides other reasons, the faunal
and floral characteristics of the former are more general than are those
of the latter, and their vertical range also is greater. Thus the sys-
tems, or stages, as I have designated them on preceding pages when
discussing the geological scale, are readily recognizable in widely sep-
arated parts of the world by means of more or less numerous general
types of fossil forms, while the characteristic types of their divisions are
fewer and more special. By means of those more general indications

sive, are recognizable in North America with as much certainty as they
are in Europe, although some of them, the Triassic and Jurassic, for
example, have not been so completely recognized.

On the other hand the recognition of the substages, or division of
systems, which are more or less clearly definable in Europe, has in no
case been made with rational satisfaction in North America, although
many geologists have attempted their full recognition on this conti-
nent, and some have even attempted that of secondary divisions of
systems not only in North America but in other parts of the world, by
means of their European characteristics.

I do not mean to say that at least some of the more general divisions
of systems are not distinguishable in North America as well as in
Europe, such for example as the Upper, Middle and Lower Devonian,
Upper and Lower Cretaceous, ete. I also do not mean to say that cer-
tain of the faunal and floral types which characterize divisions or sub-
stages, such as those of the European Cretaceous from the Neocomian
to the Danian, inclusive, as well as similar divisions of other systems,
have not been discovered in North American strata and in those of
other parts of the world.*

I claim, however, that while the systems are satisfactorily recogniz-
able as already stated, their upper and lower limits are often illy de-
finable, and that they often do not accord with the recognized limits in
Europe, and that the same is also the case with the large general divi-
sions of systems referred to. Furthermore, I claim that in case of the
presence in North American strata of types which characterize any of
those divisions of the European Cretaceous and other systems just
referred to they are so often commingled with certain of those types
which characterize one or more other divisions of the same system
there that they can not have the same chronological significance on the
two continents. That is, types which are characteristic of different
divisions of a system in Europe, and which occur there in a certain
order of suecession, are known to occur in American divisions of the
same system 1n a different order of succession. It 1s therefore evident
that the presence in a group of American strata of any one, or even
more, of the types which characterize a given division of a system in
Europe does not prove the absolute identity of that division in Amer-
ica.

Although, as before stated, all the systems of the European scale have
been satisfactorily recognized in North America, their upper and lower
limits are not only often illy definable and sometimes discordant with
those of corresponding systems in Europe, but those limits have been
designated as occurring ai different horizons by those geologists re-
spectively who ply upon different kinds of fossil remains. For exam-

 Athoneh I more “ani compare N North janeniers strata with those of Eu-
rope, and oftener refer to the Cretaceous system than to others, I assume that the
facts and principles involved are of world-wide applheation,
324 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

ple, abundant remains of a flora, consisting of types which in Europe
are characteristically Tertiary, are found in American strata, which
are Shown by all other known evidence, which is abundant, to be of
Cretaceous age. Again nonplacental mammalian remains of generally
accepted Jurassic types are found in American strata which other
evidence shows can not be of earlier age than the uppermost Creta-
ceous, if, indeed, they are not of Tertiary age. Associated with these
mammalian remains are those of dinosaurs which are so characteristic
of that great subelass in its prime, and show so little evidence of its
decadence that when they were first discovered they were believed to
be of Jurassic age.

The cause of this association of types in the strata of certain sys-
tems, or in those of certain of its divisions as they occur in some parts
of the world with those which characterize other systems or others of
their divisions in another part, must be sought in the facts and princi-
ples stated in the propositions and remarks on pages 293 to 300, whieh
propositions have been presented for the purpose of such reference.
From the facts thus stated and referred to it may be seen that such a
commingling of types, so far from being an abnormal condition, is
wholly natural and what ought to be expected. It is thus shown that
the average rate of progressive evolution which produced the types
that characterize the different systems and their respective divisions
was not the same in all parts of the world for each of the different
branches of the animal and vegetable kingdoms, nor the same for the
same part of the world during all the time those branches have
coexisted.

In view of the foregoing statements of facts and principles the idea
held by the early geologists, as well as by some of those now living,
that identity of fossil types proves synchronism or exact contempora-
neity of origin of any two or more series of strata containing them, is
quite untenable. The facts which have been presented also suggest
that the term homotaxy must be used with some degree of latitude as
to its application to the subdivisions of systems, because the order of
sequence in the occurrence ot the types which characterize them,
respectively, in one part of the world is in another part sometimes par-
tially reversed or partially interchanged. That is, the taxonomy of
those subdivisions as biologically indicated is not the same forall parts
of the world.

Although the toregoing statements contain expressions of earnest
dissent from certain views which have been more or less prevalent, it
is not to be inferred that I discard any of the legitimate principles
upon which correlative and historical geology are based. Indeed, the
evidence is incontestable that the successive stages of the geological
scale were 1n a general but an effective way characterized by peculiar
secularly developed groups of organic types, and that those types have
wonderfully wide distribution within their respective stages. With
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 325

reference to such characterization it is the adequacy of those types to
sharply define the limits of stages or to clearly identify substages in
widely separated parts of the world that I deny. This denial, of course,
implies what has before been stated, that the geological scale now in
general use is not an absolute standard for the correlation of the strati-
fied rocks of the whole earth, but I repeat what was said in connection
with that statement, that this scale is unquestionably the best that it
has been possible to devise, and make the additional statement that it
needs adjustment rather than material change.*

The foregoing discussions having required frequent reference to cer-
tain erroneous views which have prevailed upon the subject of corre-
lation that subject has necessarily been somewhat antagonistically
presented. That is, its scope has been to a large extent negatively
‘ather than positively indicated.

It has been shown that the presence in widely separated parts of the
world of all the systems of the geological scale, as well as of some of
their larger divisions, has been demonstrated by the labors of a multi-
tude of geologists and that the fact of correlation is therefore not to
be called in question. The principal questions which have been raised
concern the scope of correlation or the limitation of the assemblages
of strata the relation of which to respective divisions of the seale is
more or less obvious. These questions are of practical application in
the study of the structural geology of any part of the world other
than that in which the geological scale was established, but they are of
such a character that they must be conventionally rather than arbi-
trarily determined.

For example, in discussing the questions which have arisen concern-
ing the earlier and later limits of the systems of the geological scale in
North America the difference of opinion as to those limits have been
wider and more various with regard to the later systems than to the
earlier. This is because of the greater number and variety of the kinds
of fossil remains to be considered in such discussions of the later sys-
tems, their difference from the earlier in this respect being plainly
indicated by the table on Plate xIv, and by the accompanying statements
relating toit. It is therefore evident that in reaching a conclusion as
to the limitation of any of these systems, or of any of their subdivisions,
it is necessary to take into consideration all available facts, physical
as well as well biological. It is equally evident that it is the duty
of every American geologist to hold in abeyance any final decision as
to the correlation of the groups of strata which he may study with
divisions of the European scale until all such facts have been duly and

“Although the views concerning correlation which are enunciated in this essay
are opposed to those which were generally held by the early geologists, some of
those pioneers held views which are much in accord with those herein advocated.

Rocks. Am. Jour. Sci., Ist ser. Vol. xvii, pp. 26-37, 18380.

justly considered. In short, the idea of absoluteness in such cases is as
much out of place as is the assertion or recognition of personal authority.

Although the remarks in the last paragraph refer directly to North
American geology and geologists, they are equally applicable to other
parts of the world when reference is made to the scale as represented by
the European rocks.

Notwithstanding the great excellence of the scale now in general use
and the fact that so little change has been made in it since it was first
devised by the early geologists, the future progress of geological science
will demand modifications the necessity for which will be especially
urgent when the true character of correlation for all the principal parts
of the earth has been ascertained. Hitherto correlation has been inves-
tigated with the single purpose of adjusting the series of formations
which occur in each of the various parts of the world to the scale now
in use, but although its general applicability to that purpose is not to be
questioned the ultimate result of the study of correlation will be to
modify this scale and adjust it to the systematic geology of the whole
earth. That is, the scheme of stratigraphic classification which has
been the main factor in adjusting the elements of systematic geology,
must in turn be itself adjusted to the great system which it will have
been the principal agent in producing.

There is another subject which properly pertains to correlative
geology, but which does not come under the head of identification of
formations and only in part under that of correlation as the term has
been defined and the subject discussed on preceding pages. It relates
to the great obscurity or absence of evidence of chronological relation
between the marine and fresh water deposits which may occur upon one
and the same continent, and also to the equally great uncertainty as
to the correlation with one another of the nonmarine deposits of widely
separated parts of the earth.

When the geologist is seeking to systematically classify the forma-
tions of a continent or region which consist of both marine and fresh
water deposits, among the physical facts with which he is confronted is
that in no case can a formation of one of these kinds be ,continuous
with one of the other kind because they were necessarily deposited in
separate bodies of water. Therefore there can in no case be any direct
physical proof of contemporaneity of a fresh-water with a marine-forma--
tion, and there can be no physical indication of chronological relation
between them except in case of observable superposition. These re-
marks are made with special reference to intracontinental fresh-water
deposits on the one hand and border-region marine deposits on the
other.

He is also confronted with the biological fact stated on preceding
pages that the fossil faunas pertaining to fresh-water formations are
so different from those pertaining to mari 2 formations, and the two
kinds are so incongruous in their respective characters, even in case
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 327

of actual contemporaneity of origin, that they can not be used as con-
current chronological evidence.

The latter statement applies chiefly to the remains of aquatic faunas,
but the case is little if any changed by the association with them of
remains of land faunas and floras unless such faunas and floras should
be represented in the fresh-water as well as the marine formation.
Such association and identity are to be regarded as the only direct evi-
dence of contemporaneity of a fresh-water and marine deposit. All
other evidence is indirect and of more or less uncertain value.

Such a dual commingling of remains of a land fauna and flora with
those of aquatic faunas implies that the two bodies of water in which
the commingling took place were separated by a land area, the whole
breadth of which was occupied by the fauna and flora represented by
the remains. It also implies that those remains reached their intomb-
ment in the sediments of both bodies of water in the manner described
in Essay I. It is a fact, however, as already pointed out, that re-
mains of land animals and plants are very rarely found in marine de-
posits, even in case there is reason to believe they lived abundantly in
the vicinity of the waters in which those deposits were nade. This
circumstance greatly lessens the chances of discovering direct proof of
contemporaneity of fresh water and marine formations.

The indirect evidence of contemporaneity of fresh water and marine
formations which may occur upon one and the same continent is in part
that which is afforded by the position of each in their order of succes-
sion in a series of formations of known geological age, and in part that
which pertains to the general subject of correlation. I have already
Shown that the best of the evidence which pertains to that subject,
especially when applied to so small a portion of the geological seale as
is represented by even the greatest of the fresh water formations or
series of deposits, is of very uncertain value. I may now add that such
evidence is still less valuable when it rests upon the remains of fresh-
water faunas alone, because of their remarkably slow evolution, both
progressive and differential, during the whole of that portion of geo-
logical time in which they are known to have existed. It should also
be stated that whatever of accuracy may have been attained in assign-
ing the fresh water formations of Europe to their respective taxonomic
positions in the geological scale it does not necessarily follow that fresh
water formations upon other continents bearing closely similar faunal
and floral fossil remains can be assigned upon such evidence alone to
exactly the same taxonomic positions. Therefore, in attempting to cor-
relate interior fresh-water formations with border region marine forma-
tions, such as those which occur in North America, for example, the
geologist must, as a rule, to which no exceptions are yet known, rely
upon general indications and cumulative evidence.
328 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

VII. CRITERIA OF PAST AQUEOUS CONDITIONS.

Among the more conspicuous facts in geology are some of those which
relate to the manner of origin as well as to the original and present
condition of the sedimentary formations. These subjects have been
discussed at some length in Essay 1, and among those discussions are
some references to the character of the water in which each formation
was deposited. Studies of the sedimentary formations, especially those
made from a biological standpoint, have demonstrated that the bodies
of water in which they were deposited were of the various kinds that
are now known; that is, some were marine, some fresh, and some brack:
ish.

[tis by no means for biological reasons alone that it is desirable to
obtain a knowledge of the character of formerly existing bodies of water
and of the character of their respective aquatic faunas. On the con-
trary, such knowledge conveys important information concerning vari-
ous subjects in general geology, notably concerning formerly existing
physical conditions and many of the physical changes which took place
from epoch to epoch of geological time. For example, the presence of a
marine formation within any given geographical area shows that when
it was deposited that area was beneath ocean level, and consequently
that marine waters prevailed there. The presence of a nonmarine
formation shows that land areas surrounded the body of water in which
it was deposited and separated it more or less completely from marine
waters. Therefore, an extensive nonmarine formation necessarily im-
plies that a large land area, which may have been of continental ex-
tent, surrounded the body of water in which it was deposited.

In the present advanced state of geological knowledge the distin-
guishing characteristics of marine formations are well understood,
because they have been exhaustively studied by geologists, and found
to agree in general character with the faunas and deposits of existing
seas, and because opportunities for the study of these formations are
abundant in almost all parts of the world. For various reasons the
distinguishing characteristics of nonmarine formations are generally
not so thoroughly understood as are those of marine origin, among
which reasons are their comparative rarity and usually their compara-
tively small geographical extent. Usually, also, they are not so abun-
dantly fossiliferous as are marine formations, and, therefore, the prin-
cipal means for their characterization are often not available. More-
over, these formations require some modification of the usual methods
of investigation because they are themselves of different kinds, as is
shown by inherent evidence possessed by each, and because they have
in common certain characteristics which distinguish them from those
of marine origin.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 329

The facts which constitute the evidence as to the variety and char-
acter of the nonmarine formations, and that of their distinetion from
those of marine origin, are usually well understood by those geologists
who are also naturalists because the subject to which they relate is
mainly biological, but they are often not so well understood by the
general reader, nor by those who pursue their geological studies wholly
upon physical grounds. Tor these reasons the following statements
and discussions, while they are in some respects necessarily technical,
are, so far as practicable, expressed in an elementary manner.

The evidence that the greater part of the sedimentary rocks of the
earth, those which constitute the formations containing the records of
its past biological history, are of marine origin is based almost wholly
upon the character of their contained fossil remains, and is, as has just
been intimated, so abundant and complete that it can not be seriously
questioned. That is, it is evident that they were deposited either in
oceanic waters or in those of similar saltness whose geographical extent
were more restricted by land areas, such, for example, as the present
oceans on the one hand, and the Mediterranean and Red seas on the
other. All these are designated as marine deposits, and the waters in
which they were formed are understood to have rested at that world-
wide level which is usually termed sea level, but which is herein written
ocean level, because in this essay the term sea is used in a somewhat
restricted sense.

The other sedimentary rocks were deposited in other than oceanic
waters. Most of them so much resemble marine formations in litho-
logical and stratigraphical character, that it is only by means of the
peculiar character of their fossil remains that it is known that their
deposition took place either in fresh waters or in those which contained
salt in less proportion than it is contained in oceanic waters. <All these
are designated as nonmarine deposits. They usually occupy smaller
districts than do marine deposits but a few of them rival the latter in
thickness and geographical extent.

Nonmarine deposits are more varied in both character and origin
than is indicated by the mere evidence which they may afford that salt
was present in, or absent from, the waters in which they were accumu-
lated, because the physical conditions were in each class of cases con-
siderably different. Under the head of nonmarine sedimentary depos-
its are placed those which, from the inherent evidence they respectively
afford, are assumed to have been formed in fluviatile, estuarine or lacus-
trine waters, or in the waters of lagoons, bays, or inland seas. The
first three terms just mentioned are of themselves sufficient to indicate
that the deposits to which they are applied were laid down in formerly
existing rivers, estuaries or lakes. There are certain other nonmarine
deposits with which the geologist sometimes comes in contact, namely,
those of littoral and of palustral origin. The former are produced
along the shores of broad bodies of water and the latter in the swamps
and shoals which frequently border the same.
330 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

The terms lagoons and bays as here used are applied to such par-
tially landlocked bodies of water as now exist along oceanie borders
but which are often, at least in part, of less than marine saltness be-
cause of inflowing streams. The restricted use in this essay of the
terms lake and inland sea is indicated in the following paragraphs:

In accordance with the elementary nature of these remarks it is
thought desirable to brietly characterize the various kinds of existing
bodies of water in which sediments similar to those which constitute
the various sedimentary formations are now in process of deposition.
Such a characterization is made to consist in part of an explanation of
the special terms just referred to.

The term lake is properly applied, and ought to. be restricted, to in-
land bodies of fresh water. It will be so used in this essay except
in those cases where a contrary practice has resulted in a public recog-
nition of such proper names as Great Salt lake, ete.

The source of the water supply of lakes is rainfall, which is drained
into them from the surrounding land. It is therefore fresh in the ordi-
nary acceptation of that term, but as it enters the lake it aiways con-
tains at least a minute proportion of soluble salts derived from their
original home, the land, by leaching. The amount of salts in such
cases being inappreciable by gustatory test, lacustrine waters are prop-
erly Gesignated as fresh, but to remain fresh a lake must have free out-
flow and not excessive evaporation from its surface. Otherwise it will
become distinctly saline by the gradual accumulation of soluble salts
which inflowing streams constantly bring from the land.

The term inland sea, as used in connection with the terms indicating
other bodies of water and with reference to certain formations with
which the geologist sometimes has to deal, is applied to any body of
water more or less completely surrounded by land which holds in solu-
tion a sufficient proportion of saline matter to modify or characterize
its aquatic fauna, or which holds a so much greater proportion as to be
sufficient to prevent the existence in it of such a fauna. Therefore an
inland sea, especially one that has an outlet, differs physically from a
lake only by the presence of at least a readily appreciable amount of
soluble salts in its waters. This restricted use of the term sea is war-
‘ranted by prevalent custom with reference to the Black, Caspian, Dead,
and other existing seas.

While the difference between inland seas and lakes is important as
regards their respective aquatic faunas the distinguishing character of
both is subject to change because in both cases it depends upon physi-
cal conditions the stability of which is uncertain, and because any con-
siderable change of those conditions will result in a change of charac-
ter. For example such a change in the physical conditions which sur-
round a lake as would reduce the proportion of outflow to influx of
water and increase evaporation from its surface would, according to
the definition just given, change it to an inland sea. That is, soluble
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 331

salts would accumulate in its waters to such an extent and of sucha
character as to modify or destroy its aquatic fauna. A reversal of such
conditions would change an inland sea to a lake, because soluble salts
would cease to accumulate inits waters and the previous surplus would
gradually be removed by the free outflow which would result from such
a change.

Inland seas may hold either more or less saline matter in solution
than does the ocean. In those which by reason of having no outlet
hold more, or hold a large proportion of other salts than sodium chlo-
ride, little or no gill-bearing animal life exists. Such seas may he above
ocean level, as does Great Salt lake, in Utah, or below it, as does the
Dead sea.

But the waters of some existing inland seas which have no outlet
have not yet become so impregnated with soluble salts as to destrey,
or to prevent the accession of aquatic life.- This is at present the con-
dition of the Caspian sea, excepting some of its bays where from exces-
sive evaporation the water contains an excess of saline matter, but if
surrounding physical conditions continue the same as they now are the
present average degree of saltness of this sea will continually increase.
Its surface being more than 80 feet below ocean level it can of course
have no outlet. The land area which is drained into it, being very
large there is a considerable and constant accession of saline matter
to its waters. Therefore it can not be doubted thatif surrounding con-
ditions should remain unchanged the natural increase of soluble saline
matter will ultimately destroy all aquatic life in this sea.

The Black sea is an example of an inland sea lying nearly at ocean

level, the difference between its level and that of the Mediterranean
-and of the ocean really amounting to little or 10 more than the short
and slight river slope of the Bosphorus and of the Hellespont. The
proportion of soluble salts in the waters of this sea, like those of the
Caspian, Baltic, and other seas, differs greatly in different parts and at
different depths, the average proportion being less than that of the
oceans; but any cause which should diminish or increase its supply of
drainage water would increase or diminish its average saltness, as
already explained; and such inerease or diminution would correspond-
ingly affect the character of its aquatic fauna.
_ The general statements contained in the last three paragraphs con-
cerning the conditions which prevail in connection with existing lakes
and inland seas, and the circumstances upon which those conditions
depend, are introduced here for the purpose already indicated, and also
that they may be referred to in connection with the eriteria which are
discussed in the following paragraphs:

Because the waters in which even the latest of the ‘sedimentary for-
mations of the earth were deposited have long ago passed away, and
their beds changed to dry land, the grounds upon which geologists
assume that of the formations which they have to investigate, some
332 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

were deposited in marine, and others in nonmarine waters, and that
some of the latter deposits were formed in inland seas, some in lakes,
and some in estuaries or rivers, are necessarily inferential in character.
Still, the former existence of those previous conditions is held to be
demonstrated by means of certain accepted criteria.

The only criteria of this kind which may be vegarded as trustworthy
are based upon conditions which are observable with reference to now
existing oceanic and inland waters, and upon the character of the
organic forms which inhabit those waters respectively. They are there-
tore of two kinds, physical and biological. The physical criteria pertain
to conditions surrounding, or prevailing in the region adjacent to, each
of such bodies of water. The biological criteria pertain to the organic
forms for which any given body of water constitutes a congenial hab-
itat. As used in geological investigation, physical criteria are applied
mainly to the stratigraphieal and lithological character of sedimentary
formations or deposits, to the method of their accumulation and to the
action of those natural forces which have characterized them or con-
trolled their production. Biological criteria are applied to the fossil
remains of animals and plants which the formations respectively are
found to contain. In some instances, however, the character of the
fossil remains is such as to imply the coexistence of certain physical
conditions which may not otherwise be plainly indicated.

The distinguishing physical characteristics of fluviatile deposits, be-
sides the narrowness of their limits and the effects of self-corrasion
of their valleys, which are shown in terraces and bluffs, are the preva-
alence of shingle and sand in their channels, and of silt upon their
flood plains, and the absence of such regular stratification of any of
these materials as is to be observed in those which constitute marine
and lacustrine deposits. These characteristics are more or less plainly
apparent in the few ancient fluviatile deposits which have been disecov-
ered in association with formations which have been deposited in broad
bodies of water. It is true, however, that shingle and silt sometimes
accumulate in the marine waters of narrow straits or channels in such
a manner as to resemble fluviatile deposits, and that their wave-worn
bluffs often resemble some of those which have been produced by river
corrasion. While therefore it is sometimes practicable to recognize
among geological formations such fluviatile deposits as these by means
of physical data alone, it is always difficult and often impracticable to
do so, especially if their true character has become obscured by dis-
placement and erosion, or by the overlapping of other formations.

These remarks are made with particular reference to those ancient
river channels which have been corraded out of sedimentary forma-
tions and covered by others of a similar kind, and not to those later
channels, some of which have become covered by glacial drift and
others by lava outflows. The earlier are usually less distinet and char-
acteristic than are some of the later ones, doubtless because the effects
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 390

of a receding and encroaching shore line, and other results of the ele-
vation and depression of the land surface upon which they were formed,
generally were of a destructive character. It is of course only portions
of any of these ancient fluviatile deposits that have been discovered,
but portions of some of the later ones have fallen under unusually pre
servative conditions.

Those narrow bodies of water, usually called lagoons, which are sepa-
rated from the open ocean only by sand reefs, often partake of the charac-
ter of estuaries as regards both their aquatic life and their varying pro-
portion of soluble salts. Their deposits also so often resemble those of
estuaries that upon physical grounds alone it probably will always be
difficultand generally impracticable to distinguish from each other the
ancient deposits of these two kinds which may exist among geological
formations.

The extent of an estuarine deposit of course depends largely upon
the size of the inflowing river, the largest sometimes rivaling in ex-
tent the deposits of lakes and inland seas. In some respects their
physical characteristics resemble those of fluviatile deposits. That is,
like the latter, they contain accumulations of silt and shingle, and they
generally are wanting in that regularity of stratification which charace-
terizes the deposits of broad bodies of water. This irregularity is usu-
ally apparent even upon the outer border of an estuary, where it shows
the effects of the litoral wash of the great body of water between which
and the inflowing river it holds an intermediate place. Estuaries exist
upon the borders of both lacustrine and marine waters, but the physi-
eal character of their deposits is essentially the same in both cases.
It therefore is impracticable upon physical grounds alone to distin-
guish an estuary deposit made upon the border o7 marine waters from
one made upon a lake border.

The physical characteristics of those sedimentary deposits which
are made in lakes and inland seas are similar in all essential respects
to those made in marine waters, exeept that, as a rule, calcareous mate-
rial is more prevalent among marine deposits than any other. The
materials of which they are composed, like those of marine deposits, are
more or less evenly bedded, and they constitute characteristic members
of that great class of sedimentary deposits to which the term stratified
rocks is applied. Because of this uniformity of general characteristics
it is always difficult, and generally impossible, to demonstrate by means
of physical data alone whether a given forination was deposited in
marine waters or in those of a lake or an inland sea. Still, a geologist
who has much experience in the application of all available evidence
may often approximate a correct judgment in such cases by means of
physical data, but the almost certain presence in such strata of bio-
logical data leaves him without excuse for relying only upon the
physical.
304 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

It is apparent from the foregoing remarks that upon physical evi-
dence alone it is not practicable to satisfactorily classify the sedimen-
tary formations of the earth in such a manner as to serve the purpose of
thorough geological investigation. Therefore such data are in this, as
in most other cases, chiefly valuable as being accessory to the evidence
attorded by biological data.

The biological criteria which are relied upon by geologists to distin-
guish from one another the sedimentary formations which have been
produced in marine waters, or in those of inland seas, lakes, rivers, or
estuaries, relate to the characteristics of faunas which now inhabit
those waters respectively, and to the differences from one another of
such faunas. That is, the conclusions which geologists reach concern-
ing the questions just indicated are based upon now-existing phys-
ical conditions, upon the known character, structure, and habits of
animals with relation to those conditions, and upon the assumption
that in past geological epochs animals of a given character and struc-
ture had similar habits, and lived under conditions similar to those
which are congenial to their living congeners.

To aid in defining these criteria it is necessary to review the animal
kingdom as it now exists, and to select for consideration those portions
of it which furnish data upon which to base the necessary definitions.
This selection is based mainly upon the function of aqueous respiration,
because it is only animals possessing this function that have a direct
relation to the character of the water in the sediments of which their
remains may become intombed, and because these sediments and their
organic contents are similar in their origin to those which constitute
the fossiliferous formations with which the geologist has to deal. Land
animals are only briefly referred to in this review because they have at
best only incidental relation to the character of the respective bodies
of water near which they live and to the sediments which are depos-
ited in them, and for a similar reason plants also will be only briefly
considered. Still, remains of land animals and plants have an indirect
value in this connection, For example, it is obvious that such remains
are more likely to find intombment in inland than in marine waters.
We also may assume that they rarely reach those of the open ocean or
that they quickly become destroyed by the triturating action of the
waves if they reach oceanic waters.

All those aquatic animals whose bodies possess no internal or exter-
nal skeleton, or such portions as resist decomposition after death, are
also excluded or only incidentally mentioned, because it is those parts
only that really become fossilized, as has already been explained ir
Essay 1, and also because in the application to paleontological inves-
tigation of the facts to be presented in this review reference can be
made only to the fossil remains of animals similar to those now living.
All extinct animals are also excluded from this review because it is
these to which the criteria based upon living forms are to be applied.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 335
VERTEBRATA.

Although the Vertebrata constitute the highest division of the animal
kingdom, for the reasons just mentioned, comparatively few of them
except the fishes have a direct bearing upon any inquiry concerning
the character of formerly existing bodies of water. That is, much the
greater part of all the other vertebrates consist of land animals the
natural habitats of which have at best only an indirect relation to the
character of the waters in the sediments of which their remains may
find intombment.

Mammalia.—The Mammalia are so generally dwellers upon the dry
land that while a few are amphibious in their habits only the orders
Cetacea and Sirenia and the Phocidie and Odobenide of the order Car-
nivora are confined to an aquatic habitat, at least so far as concerns
their locomotion. Besides this, all these animals being air-breathers
their aquatic habitat may be regarded as a matter of special adapta-
tion.

Fossil remains of any of the larger Cetacea may be taken as presump-
tive evidence of the marine origin of the deposits in which they may be
found, but so many of the smaller members of that order live in estua-
ries that other evidence is usually required to determine the character
of the deposits in which fossil remains of such animals occur. Because.
the structure and habits of the Sirenia restrict them to an estuarine or
littoral habitat, fossil remains of such animals have much significance
as to the character of the deposits in which they may occur, and as to
the proximity of the land to the place where such deposits were made.
Although the Phocidie and Odobenidie usually inhabit marine waters,
they often range into estuaries and occasionally, but rarely, some of the
former inhabit fresh waters. Therefore, fossil remains of such animals
is strong presumptive, but not positive, evidence of the marine origin
of the formations in which they may be found.

The foregoing remarks apply to those mammals which live in, or
habitually resort to the water, but the larger part of all discovered fos-
sil mammalhan remains are those of strictly land animals. The manner
in which such remains have found intombment in aqueous sediments,
and the probable reasons why they are much oftener found in nonma-
rine than in marine formations have been indicated on preceding pages.

Aves.—As a class, birds have little bearing upon the subject of this
review, because their respiration is aerial, and comparatively few of
them habitually live in the water as a permanent habitat. Further-
more, with apparently the exception of the Spheniscidze and some of
the Laride, those which resort to an aquatie habitat find saline and
fresh waters equally congenial. Avian fossil remains are therefore of
comparatively little value as indicating the character of the water in
which any given formation was deposited. Still, as is the case with
the mammals and other land animals, avian remains are more likely to
be found in the sediments of inland than of marine waters.
336 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Reptilia.—All reptiles are air-breathers, and a large part of them are
strictly land animals. Many are amphibious, and some are habitually
aquatic in their habits. Among aquatic reptiles are the Hydrophide
and some of the Chelonia, which live in marine waters, and others ot
the latter order which live in fresh waters. The Crocodilia also usually
inhabit fresh waters and the shores of the same, but they frequently
‘ange into the saline waters of estuaries and lagoons. The greater
part of all living reptiles of aquatic habits, however, are found in fresh
waters, and therefore fossil reptilian remains referable to living fami-
lies are regarded as more likely to indicate a nonmarine than a marine
origin for the formation containing them.

The abundance and great variety of known fossil reptiles show that
the class is only partially represented by all those now living. Fur-
thermore, most of the extinct reptiles differed so much from any living
kinds that comparatively little inference may be drawn as to the char-
acter of their respective habitats by a consideration of those of living
reptiles. The character of the habitat of those of extinct reptiles must
be learned mainly from their osseous structure and their dentition; but
in the case of those whose aquatic habitat is thus determined, the
marine or nonmarine character of the waters in which they lived is
rarely indicated. Therefore, while a great, and doubtless the greater,
part of the preserved remains of extinct reptiles were intombed in non-
marine sediments, whether those sediments were deposited in brackish
or fresh waters must usually be learned, if learned at all, from other
evidence than that which is furnished by the remains themselves.

Batrachia.—In their larval, gill-bearing condition all Batrachians
are denizens of fresh waters, usually those of pools and marshes. A
few of them retain their gills and fresh-water habitat during life, but
most of them become air-breathers. A part of these become denizens
of the dry land, but the remainder continue to live in the palustral
habitat in which their larval stage was passed. Therefore itis assumed
that batrachian fossil remains are much more likely to be found in
strata of fresh, than of marine, or even of brackish, water origin.

Pisces.*—Because all fishes have aqueous respiration it is desirable
for the present purpose to review the whole class by families. The
general facts concerning the habitat of each family are well exhibited
by the following tabular arrangement of their names, the three columns
of the table representing marine, brackish, and fresh waters, respec-
tively. The occurrence of the name of a family only in the left hand
column indicates that no representative of it is known in any other
than marine waters; and in case the name occurs only in the right

* The classification here used is that of Dr. Theodore Gill in his arrangement of
the families of fishes as published in Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections No, 247,
pp. 1-25 and personally revised by him for this essay. Dr. Gill has long had in hand
an elaborate revision of this classification; but that which is here presented is deemed
sufficient for the illustration of these discussions,
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 337

hand column an exclusively fresh-water habitat is indicated for that
family. The occurrence of the name of a family in more than one of
the columns indicates that it has representatives in more than one of
the three kinds of habitat. The two kinds of cases first mentioned
need no further explanation, but a variety of facts connected with the
latter kind need to be considered. These will be briefly stated in the
series of explanatory notes following the table, and certain other facts
and considerations will be presented in the closing paragraphs of this

review.

The following remarks apply only to those families which have repre-
sentatives in more than one of the three kinds of aquatic habitat which
are indicated in the foregoing table. The presence of the name of a
family in only oneof the threecolumns is alone a complete expression of
the fact that no representative of it is known in any other habitat than
the one thus indicated. It must be remembered, however, that almost
any fish whose habitat ranges along the seacoast may occasionally run
up into brackish water. Consequently the families enumerated under
the head of “brackish” are such only as have representatives habitu-
ally living in brackish waters.

Although the Tetrodontid are a typically marine family, one species
of it is known in South American fresh waters.

’

waters that geologists usually regard the discovery of remains of simi-
lar fishes in any given geological formation as evidence of its marine
origin, Still, members of certain of these families present remarkable
exceptions to the general rule thus indicated; such, for example, as the
presence of Selachians in Lake Nicaragua and other fresh waters.
Therefore, in case the fossils associated with such fish remains should
distinctly indicate the fresh-water origin of the strata containing them,
their presence may be held as not necessarily constituting conflicting
evidence because of the known exceptions to the rule that their living
congeners have a marine habitat.

Of the remaining eleven families mentioned in the foregoing notes
three are more abundantly represented in fresh than in saline waters.
To these the converse of the foregoing remarks will apply. Because of
the varying range of habitat of the remaining eight families mentioned
in the foregoing notes the discovery of remains referable to any of
them in a given formation would be of little value as evidence in deter-.
mining the character of the water in which it was deposited unless
supported by other and more definite evidence.

The Marsipobranchii and Leptocardii are by some authors included
in the class of fishes proper, but Dr. Gill and others regard them as
Separate classes codrdinate with fishes, reptiles, ete.

Two of the three families belonging to the Marsipobranchii are known
only in marine waters. Most of the members of the other family,
namely, the Petromyzontidwe, range from marine into brackish and
fresh waters, as is well known in the case of the lampreys.

No representation of the Leptocardii are known in other than marine -
waters.

This review of the fishes is confined to those families which have
living representatives, and the criteria relating to the different kinds
of aquatic habitat of fossil fishes which may be based upon this review
apply directly only to the families here named.

Fossil remains of a large number of kinds of fishes have been dis-
covered, especially in the paleozoic formations, which differ so much
from all living kinds that they can be referred to no family, and some-
times to no order, which has living representatives.

The character of the water in which such fishes lived might be con-
jectured by reference to their most nearly related forms, but the most
reliable indication is firnished by such other fossil remains as may be
found associated with them.

MOLLUSCA.~

The Mollusea are of peculiar importance in connection with the sub-
ject of this review, because the greater part of the members of this sub-
kingdom have aqueous respiration, and because in the matter of

‘The classification of the Mollusca used in this review is that of Dr. Theodore
Gils “Arrangement of the Families of Mollusks.” See Smithsonian Miscellaneous
Publications, No. 227, 1871.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 045

distinguishing marine from nonmarine formations and the latter from
one another it is with their often abundant fossil remains that the geol-
ogist has more frequently to deal than with those of any other animals.

Cephalopoda.—Every known member of all the families of this class
is exclusively marine, therefore the presence of fossil remains reterable
to any member of the class in any formation is regarded as sufficient
evidence of its marine origin, provided that its character and condition
indicate that the animals thus represented were denizens of the waters
in which the formation was deposited.

Gasteropoda.—The following table, constructed upon the same plan
as that of the fishes, is intended to give asynoptical view of the aquatic
habitat of each of the families of living gasteropods which have direct
relation to the subject of this review. For obvious reasons all those
families are omitted which include only air-breathers as well as those
families all the members of which possess no shell, either internal or
external. As in the case of the preceding table, this one is followed
by explanatory notes setting forth certain facts which are not clearly
expressed by means of such a tabular arrangement:

The foregoing table of the families of living Gasteropoda is, as
already stated, constructed upon the same plan as that of the fishes, an
explanation of which plan and its significance is given on page 33.
The list ineludes the names of only those families at least some mem-
bers of which possess shelly or skeletal parts that are likely to resist
decomposition after the death ot the animal. Other families are not
included, because it is only by means of those hard parts that the liv-
ing can be compared with fossil forms. The significance or placing the
name of a family in only one of the three columns of the table is so ap-
parent as to need little, if any, explanation, but there are certain facts
relating to members of others of these families which such a table can
not distinctly show. Mention of such of these and kindred facts as is
deemed necessary for the present purpose is made in the following
supplementary notes.

The greater part of the Buecinidie inhabit marine waters,.but they
not unfrequently range into estuaries, and certain species are sometimes
found in waters that are nearly or quite fresh.

While a majority of the species of the Assiminiidie find a fresh-water
habitat congenial, some live upon the borders of saline water, at river
mouths or in estuaries.

Of the living forms referable to‘the Rissoidae some inhabit marine,
some brackish, and others fresh waters, but no species is known to
vange from one of these kinds of habitat into another, although it is
probable that some may do so. Because the fossil species referable to
this family may, as a rule, be regarded as distinct from all living spe-
cies, the presence of fossil shells referable to this family in any forma-
tion does not necessarily give any definite indication as to whether it
was of marine, brackish, or fresh water origin. In such cases the char-
acter of the habitat must be determined by means of their faunal asso-
ciliates.

The Littorinidie usually inhabit the margins of marine waters, but
some species have a brackish-water habitat.

The Melanopsidwe usually inhabit fresh waters, but some of them are
ound in waters that are more or less saline.
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 349

Allliving forms of the Melaniid areregarded as fresh-water mollusks,
but a few species appear to be able to live in waters which are in some
degree saline. Certain fossil members of this family have been found
in such association with other molluscan remains as to indicate that
they were capable of living in saline waters.

Much the greater part of the Cerithiide inhabit marine waters, but
some species are known to find a congenial habitat in brackish waters,
and a few are known to range into adjacent fresh waters.

As a rule, the Neritidve are found ineither marine or brackish waters,
but a few species are known to live in fresh water.

The Trochus-like shells which have been found in Lake Tanganyika
probably do not beiong to the Trochide. The trochids are therefore
regarded as distinetly marine.

A few of the Acmzid limpets found in Borneo are reported to pass
from saline waters into fresh. The Acmeid are not uncommon in
brackish waters, but members of the family are most abundant in ma-
rine waters.

The Otinide, Auriculide, Siphonariidwe, and Gadinidie, are air-
breathing moliusks living upon the margins of both marine and brack-
ish waters. The Amphibolidie also usually inhabit the sea margin, but
some of them appear to find waters of less than marine saltness not

-uncongenial.

Although the Bullidwe are, as a rule, strictly marine, two genera,
namely, Haminea and Tornatella, have been found in the mud of brack-
ish water lagoons.

As indicated in the paragraph preceding this table, all the members
of the Gasteropod order Nudibranchiata, together with all those of the
Pteropod order Gymnosomata are omitted from it because none of the
species possess more than a minute embryonic shell, and therefore no
identifiable fossil remains of any members of these orders are likely to
be discovered. All the Tunicata and land Pulmonata also are omitted,
the former because the character of the body is always such that re-
mains of it are not likely to be found fossilized, and the latter, because
they have no direct relation to an aquatic habitat.

Of the twelve families mentioned in the foregoing notes as having
representatives in more than one of the three kinds of habitat indicated
in the table, fully one-half of them are so generally found only in marine
waters that geologists usually are inclined, in the absence of contrary
evidence, to regard fossil representatives of them as indicating a marine
origin for the strata in which they may occur. Three of the other fam-
ies are so generally found only in fresh waters that the converse of
the foregoing remarks would apply to them. Representatives of the
others are so often found in both marine and nonmarine waters that
in the case of fossil representatives it is always necessary to have cor-
roborative evidence as to the probable character of the water in which
they lived.

The following remarks are confined to those families which are known
to have representatives in more than one of the three kinds of aquatie
habitat indicated in the foregoing table.

The Teredinidw are properly regarded as a marine family, but at
least one living species is known in a fresh-water habitat, namely, in
the lower Ganges. Therefore the discovery of a fossil member of this
family is not of itself positive, although presumptive, proof of the marine
origin of the formation containing it.

A similar remark may be made concerning the Solecurtide, a few
species of which have been found in brackish waters, and in rare cases
some have been known to range into fresh waters.

The Corbulide are common in both marine and brackish waters, and
they are occasionally found to have passed into adjacent fresh waters
or to have survived the freshening of the saline waters in which they
formerly lived. Fossil members of this family are often found with
only marine associates, quite as often with brackish water associates,
and in rare cases all associated species are fresh-water forms.

Some species of both the Psammobiide and Glauconomide have
been found in estuarine waters of considerably less than marine saltness.
Therefore fossil species referable to either of these families are likely
to be found associated with an estuarine fauna.

The Cyrenide like the Corbulidie, are represented in marine, brack-
ish, and purely fresh waters, and the paleontological significance of both
families is similar.

The range of habitat of the Cyrenoidide is similar to that of the
Cyrenide, except that none of them are known to inhabit purely tresh
waters.

The Dreissenide as a family appear to find marine, brackish, and
352 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.*

fresh waters equally congenial, and some species appear to range into
both brackish and fresh water. This family, however, is represented
by a greater number of species in nonmarine than in marine waters.

The Adacnidie are seldom or never found in waters of full marine
saltness, but they are found in such waters as those of the fresher por-
tions of the Black sea, in estuarine waters, and in those which are quite
fresh. Therefore fossil members of this family are regarded as indicat-
ing a nonmarine origin for the deposits containing them.

One feels so fully warranted in regarding the living Arcidi asa
marine family that he expects to find no exception among its fossil
members, but the case of the living fresh-water Scaphula gangetica
shows that this rule is not absolute. Therefore it is possible, if not
probable, that fossil members of this family may be discovered in non-
marine formations.

While the Mytilidie all thrive in waters of full marine saltness, some
of them also thrive in brackish waters. Entirely fresh waters, however,
seem to be uncongenial to all of them.

All the Ostreide thrive in waters of full marine saltness. They thrive
equally well in the less saline waters of estuaries and bays, but never
in entirely fresh waters. Therefore the presence of fossil representa-
tives of this family in any formation is taken to indicate that the water
in which it was deposited was at least in some degree saline.

The Anomiidée are far more abundant in marine than in any other
waters, but they are frequently found in the less saline waters of bays
and lagoons. They are not known to occur in fresh waters, and it is
therefore inferred that no fossil members of this family had a fresh-
water habitat.

Brachiopoda.—Every known member of all the families of this class
is exclusively marine. Therefore geologists regard the presence in
any formation of Brachiopod remains as_ sufficient evidence of its
marine origin, in case there is no indication of its accidental presence.

Polyzoa.—With the exception of the three fresh-water families, Pee-
tinatellidie, Cristatellide, and Plumatellidie, all the Polyzoa inhabit
saline waters, most of them living in those of full marine saltness. A
few of them range into brackish waters, but as a class they are so gen-
erally marine in their habits that the geologist rarely hesitates to con-
clude that any formation is of marine origin which contains fossil
polyzoan remains. This conclusion is supported by the fact that the
living fresh-water representatives of the class are rarely provided with
skeletal, protective, or supporting parts which resist decomposition
after the death of the colonies of minute animals.

ANNULOIDA.

The Annuloida are divisible into two classes, the Scolecida and Eech-
inodermata. All the Seolecida are omitted from this review because
the remains of no representative of any of its families is likely to be
discovered in a fossil state,
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 353

Every known member of all the families of the class Echinodermata
is a denizen of marine waters. Therefore the discovery in any forma-
tion of fossil remains referable to this class is accepted as proof of its
marine origin.

3 ANNULOSA.

The classes Myriapoda and Arachnida are omitted from this review
because they are all land animals except the few that find a congenial
habitat in more or less direct contact with water.

In their adult state the Insecta are generally land animals, but some of
them resort to at least a partially aquatic habitat. In their larval state,
however, many insects are true aquatic animals, usually living in fresh
waters. In this state some of them possess no such skeletal or protee-
tive parts as are likely to resist decomposition, but many of them, like
the adult Insecta, Arachnida and Myriapoda, are provided with a chi-
tinous covering which retains more or less completely the bodily form
of the animal after its death and decomposition. Therefore such forms
are not unfrequently found preserved in a fossil state, but because all,
or nearly all the members of those three classes had either a land or
fresh-water habitat their remains are much more likely to find intomb-
mentin the sediments of fresh waters than in those of either brackish
or marine waters. Indeed no such remains are known to have been
found in any deposits which are unmistakably of marine origin.

Crustacea.—All the Crustacea being provided with gills or other
organs suited to aqueous respiration have a peculiarly direct relation
to the subject of these discussions. All of them also being provided
with a more or less complete dermal skeleton or outer covering which
resists decomposition and retains the form of the animal after its death,
necessarily are of great paleontological importance. It is, however,
true that their practical value in the present discussion is much less
than that of the Mollusca not because of any inferiority, but because
crustacean remains are comparatively very rare, especially in all North
American strata which represent that portion of geological time during
which were deposited the principal unmistakably nonmarine forma-
tions. For this and other reasons a tabulation of the families of the
living Crustacea like that of the fishes and mollusks on preceding
pages has been omitted. Some of the more important facts concerning
the range of habitat of certain of the various groups which constitute
this class are, however, recorded in the following paragraphs.

This review of the Crustacea is, therefore, somewhat more general
than that of the fishes and mollusks. That is, no regular classification
of the Crustacea is attempted, but the remarks are ranged under the
head of the general divisions of the class, and direct reference is made
only to those families or other subdivisions representatives of which
are found in either fresh or brackish waters or both. All those sub-
divisions, which are not specially mentioned, are not known to live i
other than marine waters.

354 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Members of many of the families of the large subclass Malacostraca
range beyond the limits of marine waters, but most of them are con-
fined to a marine habitat.

The living Brachyurans are so generally of marine habitat that in the
absence of any conflicting evidence geologists are usually disposed to
regard all those strata as of marine origin which contain fossil remains
referable to this division of the Crustacea, but the following facts show
that this exclusive view is not admissible. The greater part, if not all
of one subfamily, the Thelphusinia, are either denizens of tresh waters
or live a large part of the time upon the land in the vicinity of fresh
waters. Some species of the Grapsoidea, although most of them are
marine, also have a similar range and peculiarity of habitat while
others are apparently confined to brackish waters. Many of the marine
as well as of the fresh-water species of the Grapsoidea range more or
less upon the land.

Although it is well to emphasize the fact that most of the species
and genera of the Brachyurans are typically marine animals, many of
them besides those already referred to, such, for example, as the genera
Callinectes and Panopeus, range into estuaries and bays, some of them
going into adjacent fresh waters without apparent inconvenience. It
is also a Significant fact that of the Brachyurans, as well as of the
Macrurans which inhabit fresh waters, many more are found in fluvia-
tile and palustral than in lacustrine waters.

The range of habitat of the Anomoura is similar to that of the Brach-
yura. Most of them live in waters of full marine saltness, some
inhabit brackish waters, some wander inland, and one genus, Aiglea,
is nearly or quite confined to fresh waters. It is thus apparent that
the discovery of fossil remains of a representative of this group of Crus-
taceans in a given formation would not necessarily be proof of its marine
origin.

The Macrura as a whole have a wide range of aquatic habitat, most
of them living in marine waters, many in fresh waters, and some of
them venturing occasionally upon the land.

The family Astacidze proper, or crayfish, are all denizens of fresh
water, while those similar genera which were formerly referred to this
family are confined to a marine habitat, with the probable exception
that some of them range into brackish waters. Although many of the
Astacide burrow in wet earth at considerable distances from any body
of water, few or none of them wander so far upon the land as do some
of the Brachyura or even some of the Anomoura.

The Crangonid are generally of marine habitat, but some range into
brackish waters.

Most if not all the Atyidz inhabit fresh waters.

Many of the Palemonid are restricte i to marine waters, many live
in brackish waters, and several genera are confined to fresh waters,
some of them living in rivers far from the sea,
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 355

As arule the Peneide inhabit marine waters, but some of the spe-
cies are known to range into fluviatile waters.

The Stomatopoda have considerable range of habitat. Some of the
Myside range from marine into brackish waters, and at least one spe-
cies is found in inland fresh waters.

The Squillidze are, as a rule, marine forms, but some of them range
into brackish waters.

The greater part of the Isopoda inhabit marine waters, but many
genera are confined to fresh waters, while all the members of one family,
the Oniscidie, are of terrestrial habitat. A considerable number of
genera also range into brackish water.

All known members of the Anisopoda are denizens of marine waters.

A considerable proportion of the species and many genera of the
Amphipoda are denizens of fresh water while most of the others are
confined to a marine habitat, many ranging into brackish waters.

The subclass Entomostraca embraces a greater proportion of denizens
of nonmarine waters than does the subclass Malacostraca. They are
also of special interest to the geologist because representatives of at
least one suborder are found in much earlier formations than are any
members of the other subelass.

The Cirripedia are so generally regarded by geologists as being ex-
clusively denizens of marine waters, or of those which are of nearly
full marine saltness, that they rarely hesitate to accept the presence of
fossil remains of any crustacean referable to this order in auy forma-
tion as evidence of its marine origin. One species of Balanus, how-
ever, has been found in comparative abundance ranging from marine
waters far up the St. John’s river in Florida, and thriving there in
fresh water. This case is apparently as exceptional as that, for exam-
ple, of the Teredinoid and Arcoid mollusks in the lower Ganges and of
Selachian fishes in Lake Nicaragua, but it may be that other similar
cases will be found among the Cirripedia. Still, in the absence of con-
flicting evidence geologists are probably justified in regarding Cirriped
remains as indicating marine conditions.

The Copepoda are mostly minute animals, and inhabit both fresh and
salt waters. They are usually provided with a chitinous or membra-
nous covering which, with few exceptions, is too delicate to be well
preserved in sediments after the death of the animal. It is probable,
therefore, that few fossil remains of these animals have ever become
fossilized, and these are likely to escape discovery because of their
minuteness and delicacy.

Various forms of the bivalve Crustacea constituting the Ostracoda
are found in both fresh and marine waters, and also in the brackish
water of estuaries. They are often gregarious, immense numbers being
often found together. Their former abundance was also great, as is
shown by the multitudes of fossil forms that are sometimes found in
the sedimentary rocks of various ages. :
356 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Most of the Phyllopoda inhabit fresh waters, but some live in marine,
and some in brackish waters. They ave mostly small or minute Crus-
taceans but being gregarious they are often found together in great
numbers. Their paleontological value is similar to that of the Ostra-
coda except that the latter are more prevalent in the paleozoic forma-
tions.

Nearly or quite all the Crustacea of the earlier geological ag2s are
referable to the subclass Gigantostraca, but its living representatives
are only the Xiphosura, and these are confined to two species of the
gepus Limulus. Although the Malacostraca are more conspicuously
abundant than all other living Crustaceans, fossil remains referable to
any divisions of this subclass are comparatively rare in strata of any
age and none have been found in rocks of earlier than Carboniferous
age. On the contrary, the Gigantostraca, which are represented by
only two known living species, existed in great abundance in the Cain-
brian, Silurian and Devonian ages, when they were represented by
numerous genera and families, especially of the trilobites.

It is therefore evident that a knowledge of the different kinds of
aquatic habitat of living crustaceans affords little direct information
concerning that of those which lived during the three earlier geological
ages just mentioned. Consequently all the obtainable evidence of this
kind is derived from the remains of their faunal associates. Much the
greater proportion of all those ancient crustaceans, including all of the
trilobites, are thus assumed to have lived in marine waters, but the
usual absence of immediately associated forms that can be with cer-
tainty assigned to either a marine or nonmarine origin has left in
doubt the question as to the character of the water in which others of
the Gigantostraca lived.

Annelida.—The members of this class which possess such skeletal or
protective parts as are most likely to resist decomposition are the Tubi-
cola, all of which secrete a shell, usually calcareous, much resembling
the shells of gasteropod mollusks. They are all denizens of saline
waters, mostly those of the open ocean. By means of the partly chiti-
nous covering of certain of the Errantia or roving worms, their bodily
form may occasionally be preserved after the death of the animal in the
sediments which formed its habitat while living; and their presence in
such sediments is often indicated by their burrows when the animals
themselves are not discovered.

So generally are the Annelida denizens of marine waters that the
presence of the remains or burrows of any of them in a geological for-
mation is regarded by geologists as indicating its marine orig n.

CQLENTERATA.

The Hydrozoa only of the somewhat numerous orders embraced in
this subkingdom are represented in fresh waters. These fresh-water
representatives are all minute, and are not furnished with skeletal parts
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 357

such as would be likely to be preserved in a fossil state. Therefore it
is not to be expected that fossil remains referable to the Ca@lenterata
will be found in any formation of fresh-water origin.

The marine subclasses Siphonophora, Discophora, and Lucernarida,
as well as many members of the class Actinozoa, are also all destitute
of such skeletal parts as are likely to long resist decomposition after
the death of the animal. It is an interesting fact that unmistakable
imprints of the bodies of Coelenterata belonging or related to the jelly-
fishes have been found in certain geological strata composed of ex-
tremely fine sediments; but, as a rule, the geologists can not hope to
discover any fossil traces of animals which in life were not furnished
with such skeletal or integumentary parts as would resist the decompo-
sition of their soft parts after death. While the bodies of many of the
Coelenterata are wholly of this soft character, a large proportion of them
are furnished with stony skeletal parts, the most conspicuous examples
of which are the numerous kinds of corals. Others are furnished with
corneous or chitinous coverings or supports which are sometimes found
fossilized. So characteristic are these Actinozoa of marine waters that
the geologist does not hesitate to accept as of marine origin any forma-
tion containing fossil corals, which are the skeletal parts of such
animals,

PROTOZOA,

Of the Protozoa only the orders Foraminifera, Radiolaria, and Spon-
gida need be mentioned in this review, because only representatives of
these orders secrete such hard parts as are likely to be preserved in a
fossil state. Much the greater portion of the Protozoa are microscopic-
ally minute, but the sponges and some other forms are frequently of
large size. The Protozoa live in both fresh and marine waters, but
they are so very much more abundant in the latter that the discovery
of their remains in a geological formation is usually taken as indicat-
ing its marine origin.

PLANTS,

Compared with the fossil remains of animals very little direct infor-
mation can be obtained from those of plants as to the character of the
water in which the formations containing them were deposited.

The siliceous remains of diatoms often constitute layers of consider-
able thickness among the sedimentary rocks, but because they are
found in both marine and nonmarine deposits, and because of the
special character of their classification, they are not definitely referred
to in these discussions.

All seaweeds or marine plants are far more simple in structure than
land plants and their composition is such as to insure their rapid de-
composition. This character has prevented their fossilization in the
sediments of formerly existing seas in such a condition as to be of any
considerable value in paleontological study. The case is somewhat
358 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

different as regards palustral plants, the character of most of which
may usually be accepted as trustworthy evidence of their nonmarine
habitat. Still, the remains of land plants, like those of land animals,
are far more likely to have found the quiet entombment necessary to
their preservation in the sediments of nonmarine than in those of
marine waters, because the former waters were surrounded by the land
upon which the plants grew, and because the nonmarine sediments
receiving such remains are, aS a rule, not subject to the destructive
littoral wash which usually prevails along sea borders.

The following faets and assumptions have a direct bearing upon the
foregoing statements and discussions and upon their practical applica-
tion to geological investigation.

The various bodies of water which existed during geological time,
and which constituted the habitat of aquatic animals, were of the same
kinds that now exist, namely, marine and fresh, together with those of
the various intervening grades of saltness. Although it is probable
that the marine waters of early geological time were not so salt as
those of the present oceans, it is believed that this difference in salt-
ness has not been so great as to make any appreciable difference as to
legitimate conclusions of the kind that have been indicated on pre-
ceding pages. It seems to be especially evident that this difference
has been thus inappreciable since the close of paleozoic time, since
which time the greater part of the known unmistakably nonmarine
formations were deposited.

Existing bodies of water are constantly depositing materials similar
to those of which the sedimentary rocks are composed.

In past geological epochs the habits of animals of a given character
and structure were the same as those of similar now living animals,
and they lived under conditions similar to those which are congenial
and necessary to their now living congeners. Also in those epochs
plants of a given character lived under conditions similar to those
which are necessary to the corresponding kinds of now living plants.

Those animals alone which are furnished with organs for aqueous
respiration ean be confidently relied upon as indicating the character
of the water in which they respectively lived.

Thus, if all the known now living members of a given family are con-
fined to marine, cr to fresh waters, as the case may be, it is assumed
that the habitat of the extinct members of such families were similarly
restricted, and that the presence of fossil remains of such animals in a
given formation is, in the absence of conflicting facts, sufficient evi-
dence of its marine origin on the one hand or of its fresh-water origin
on the other. Again, if a given family is known to have representa-
tives now living in marine, brackish, and fresh waters, respectively, it
is assumed that it had a similar range of habitat during past geolog-
ical epochs. Therefore, the discovery in a given formation of fossil re-
mains of a single representative of a family having such a varied range
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 359

of habitat is not of itself sufficient to enable one to decide whether it
was of marine, brackish, or fresh water origin, and other evidence
must be sought. }

The evidence upon which criteria of the character of formerly exist-
ing bodies of water are based is usually more or less direct, but it is
sometimes cumulative and concurrent in its character. Still, when
properly applied, the latter kind of evidence is ustially nearly or quite
as valuable as if it were absolute and direct.

The criteria of past aqueous conditions which are discussed in this
essay are of course only such as may be derived from sedimentary
formations and their contents. It can not be said that there are any
fully trustworthy physical criteria because a nonmarine formation
rarely presents any condition of stratification, or any lithological
character, which is not observable in some marine formations. Still,
there are many more or less valuable indications which may be ob-
served and to some degree relied upon in the absence of fossil remains.

For example, although considerable accumulations of calcareous
strata are sometimes found among the generally arenaceous strata of
fresh-water formations they have never been found to contain any im-
portant accumulations of regularly bedded limestones. Furthermore,
estuarine deposits are often still more of a detrital character than are
fresh-water formations and also they more rarely contain calcareous
layers. Therefore if one should encounter a series of regularly bedded
limestones, either magnesian or fully calcareous, he will rarely, if ever,
be at fault in regarding them as of marine origin even without biologi-
cal evidence.

In a large proportion of the nonmarine formations the stratification
is less regular than is usually the case with marine formations. Still,
this by no means is a certain criterion, and in some cases nonmarine
formations are found to rest so conformably upon the marine and to
be so conformably overlain by them as to give little indication of the

great difference in the condition of their origin.

The foregoing examples show how indefinite is the character of physi-
‘al evidence as to the past aqueous conditions under which the various
sedimentary formations have been produced, but they serve to empha-
size a statement of the fact that almost entire reliance must be placed
upon the evidence furnished by fossil remains.

With reference to general indications of difference between marine —
and nonmarine formations which are furnished by their fossil remains
we observe that a conspicuous difference lies in the comparative abun-
dance and variety of forms of life which the fossil faunas of the for-
mations respectively represent. Marine waters have always teemed
with life in a wonderful variety of forms, and their fossil remains are
proportionally abundant. The variety is less in brackish waters and
least of all in lacustrine waters. It is true that ichthyie life is abun-
dant in some fresh waters, but never so generally abundant or so
360 ’ REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

various aS in marine waters. It is also true that mollusean life is
often locally abundant in shallow fresh waters, but, as already several
times mentioned, the variety is extremely meager. All these peculiar-
ities are distinctly observable among the fossil faunas of the non-
marine formations.

Other general indications of difference between marine and non-
marine formations are furnished by remains of land plants and animals.
Open-sea formations are naturally free from any vegetal remains de-
rived from the land, although coal and other materials of vegetal origin
are not unfrequently found alternating with layers containing marine
fossil remains. ‘These, however, as explained on a preceding page, are
regarded as cases of emergence of the bottom of shallow sea waters and
the subsequent subsidence of the same as plant laden marshy land. It
is a matter of fact, the reason for which has been suggested in preced-
ing essays, that plant remains of any kind, especially such as are in
a classifiable condition, have so rarely been found associated with re-
mains of denizens of marine waters that the discovery of fossil plants
in any formation is of itself presumptive evidence of its nonmarine
origin.

It has already been shown on preceding pages that the remains of
land animals have so seldom reached marine waters or, having reached
them, they were probably so generally destroyed by the triturating
action of coast waves that the discovery of any of this kind of fossil
remains in any formation may also be regarded as presumptive evidence
of its nonmarine origin.

The foregoing statements have been made with reference to indica-
tions which are either of a general character or without direct relation
to the quality of the waters in which sedimentary formations have been:
deposited. All the direct evidence, as already has been fully stated).
is derivable from the fossil remains of the denizens, especially the gill-
bearing kinds, ot the waters in which were deposited the formations:
under investigation.

Referring to the foregoing review of the animal kingdom, including
the tables which it embraces, it will be seen that a large number of
families of both fishes and invertebrates are confined to a marine hab:
itat, and that every member of even some of the higher divisions is:
similarly restricted. For example, every known member of the classes:
Cephalopoda and Brachiopoda is confined to a marine habitat, It will
also be seen that a certain small number of families, especially of the:
mollusea, are equally restricted to fresh waters. The significance of:
such cases as these has already been pointed out, but it is desirable to
refer to them again.

Fossil remains representing any one of these kinds of animals may:
be taken as positive evidence of the quality of the water in which was
deposited the formation containing them, provided there shall be no
room for reasonable doubt that the animals were really denizens of:
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 361

that water. That is, caution is necessary even in these more positive
cases, especially when the amount of discovered fossil material is mea-
gre.

Not only caution but the exercise of careful judgment is necessary
in other cases. For example, it will also be seen by referring to the
foregoing review that certain families, while most of its members are
confined to one kind of water, may have one or more representatives
in other kinds, and again that certain families may have representa-
tives in all the known kinds of habitable waters. In such cases as these
it is plain that all evidence afforded by fossil remains to be of any
value must be corroborated by other evidence.

Still, the cases are very few in which serious doubt need be enter-
tained as to the true character of the water in which a given formation
was deposited. This is especially true if the fossil remains are suffi-
cient in quantity and perfection to approximately represent the whole
fauna that lived in those waters. Indeed, if the facts which are re-
corded on the preceding pages are borne in mind there need be no more
doubt as to what was the quality of the water in which any given for-
mation was deposited than might arise concerning any other geological
observation.

VIII. THE CLAIMS OF GEOLOGICAL SCIENCE UPON INVESTIGATORS,
MUSEUMS, ETC.

With reference to the ordinary pursuits of life it ean hardly be said
that, aside from a natural demand for respectable emulation, one’s
occupation has any claims upon him other than those which are either
conventionally or legally imposed by society upon every one of its
members. The geological investigator, however, is not only amenable
to all such claims but to others of a different nature which, although
not enforceable by legal, and unfortunately not yet by conventional,
penalties are not less imperative in their character.

These claims upon the investigator will be presented in the following
paragraphs, but it is well to remark here that they are by no means an
abridgement of his rights as an individual, because he has no rights
with relation to science which the latter does not confer. It is true
that the legal right of personal ownership of scientific material and
the abstract right of independent investigation can not be questioned
from the standpoint of the ordinary affairs of life, but it is my purpose
to show that the individual investigator owes an allegiance to science
which demands at least a modification of the privilege of asserting
those rights. That is, ] propose to show that because the general
advancement of geological science must be accomplished and its integ-
rity maintained by the coéperation of a multitude of workers in the
various branches of investigation, its claims are superior to those of
the individual, and that he can not exclusively assert the rights referred
to without material disadvantage to science. Indeed, he can not do so
without lessening, and to some extent destroying, the value of his own
labors.

Much might be said in favor of the demands which may be made in
the name of science upon the individual on the ground of justice and
of moral and social ethics, but I shall omit all considerations of this kind
and refer only to those claims which are supported by the urgent neces-
sities of science itself. Claims of the kind referred to might be made
in favor of all the various divisions of science, but I shall on the pres-
ent occasion confine my discussions to those which pertain to biological
geology, including both its structural and systematic branches. With
reference to the manner in which the subject of this essay is pre-
sented it is proper to say that the homilitie form has not been adopted
merely from personal preference, but because I believe it to be in the
present case a proper and effective, if an indirect, method of calling
attention to prevalent errors, and of suggesting necessary improve-
ments in certain prevalent methods.

These claims of science will be considered not only with reference to
the individual investigator, but to associations, museums, and geolog-
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 363

ical organizations. Those which may be’ made upon the individual
investigator relate to the manner of prosecuting his work and of pub-
lishing its results, and also to his final disposition of the evidence upon
which his conclusions are based. Claims upon associations or societies
relate to the character and methods of publication; those upon muse-
mms, to the conservation and installation of fossil remains and of the
records pertaining to them; and those upon organizations, to the pres-
ervation of the integrity of geological science.

Among the necessities of geological science which require the enforce-
ment of these claims are those which arise from its extensive range,
the interrelation of its various branches, and the cumulative character
of the evidence upon which it is based. Its extensive range makes it
impossible that any one investigator should compass more than a small
part of the whole field, the interrelation of its branches requires that
each branch should be investigated with direct reference to all the
others, and the cumulative character of the evidence which constitutes
its foundation requires that every item of that evidence should be con-
ventionally judged. These conditions show that it is the public and
not the individual that must be the final arbiter of all questions per-
taining to the results of investigation. It is, therefore, essential that
the public should be furnished with all the evidence upon which the
individual reaches his conclusions, and that this evidence should be so
preserved as to be accessible to all investigators.

In all such arbitrations a clear distinction must necessarily be made
between evidence and testimony. The former rests upon facts and is
therefore intrinsically infallible. The latter rests only upon individual
judgment and is in every case liable to be modified even by its authors,
and to be questioned, if not opposed, by others. Facts observed and
recorded, and material collected and preserved, constitute a perpetual
source of evidence, but personal authority can have no permanently
exclusive or dominant place with relation to geological science, and
acceptable personal responsibility for published conclusions and an-
nouncements of discovery must be confined to those which are sup-
ported by tangible evidence and by reference to all obtainable funda-
mental and relevant facts.

In biological geology the principal evidence necessary to be obtained
is of two kinds, biological material in the form of fossil remains, and
stratigraphic conditions with relation to geological structure and gen-
eral stratigraphic classification. The fossil remains must necessarily
be collected for study, and science justly demands that they should be
placed where they will ever after be accessible to all investigators. It
is also essential that observations of stratigraphical conditions should
be made in immediate connection with the collection of fossil remains,
and that such observations and collections should in all cases be
so recorded and published that every locality may be readily revisited
and identified, and every observation repeated by any other observer.
'364 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

In short, it is essential that the public should be furnished with the
Same means of judging of the significance of all the facts and condi-
tions that may be reported by an original, or any other, observer that
they have themselves employed. It is largely with reference to the
collection and conservation of the kinds of evidence referred to that
the claims of biological geology are here presented.

In considering the claims of science upon the individual it is desir-
able to make some reference to the amateur as well as to the special
investigator. This recognition of nonprofessional work is desirable
because the general subject of geology has acquired such a hold upon
the popular mind and the opportunities for making observations with
relation to it are everywhere so common that in every civilized coun-
try there is a multitude of persons who are in the habit of making more
or less critical observations. Notwithstanding the usually limited and
desultory character ‘of such observations, they have often contributed
materially to the general fund of geological knowledge, especially when
accompanied by a faithful record and preservation of evidence. Indeed
some of the most valuable facts in geology have been brought out by
amateur observers, whothemselves were hardly conscious that they had
made their way alone to the frontier of acquired knowledge; and from
the ranks of such observers have arisen many of the leaders in geologi-
cal investigation.

Although only a small proportion of amateur observers can hope to
accomplish so much as this, it is proper to assume that a very large pro-
portion of them desire to contribute all they can to the advancement
of science. These will therefore be included with other individual in-
vestigators in presenting the claims of science upon them, but for
obvious reasons no reference need be made to those whose attention is
directed to geology by mere curiosity or the desire for pecuniary gain.
In the following remarks concerning the claims of science upon the in-
dividual the amateur will readily perceive what portions of them are
applicable to himself.

It has been shown in the preceding essays that systematic geology
could have no existence without the use of fossil remains. and also that
without their use structural geology would be reduced to mere local
and disconnected studies. It has also been shown that to arrive at a
just estimate of the value of fossil remains in these branches of geology
they must be thoroughly and systematically studied as representatives
of faunas and floras as well as tokens of the formations in which they
are found. The proper collection and preservation of fossil remains is
therefore a subject of the greatest importance. In view of these facts
it is the plain duty of every geologist upon beginning a piece of field
work in structural geology to accompany every step of his examina-
tion of the strata by as full a collection as possible of the contained
fossils and to preserve them, together with notes recording the results
of his observations and a statement of all the facts relevant thereto,
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 3865

If it were practicable to obtain from these fossils at sight all the infor-
mation which they are capable of conveying, and if the judgment of
every collector were so infallible that no codperation by other observers
and no final arbitration by the scientific public were necessary, it
would not be essential to the successful prosecution of field work that
fossils should be collected and preserved. But this is only a negative
method of stating the imperative necessity of making full collections of
fossils in the prosecution of investigations in structural geology and of
preserving them for future reference.

Fossils thus collected and the facts concerning them recorded become
invested with a value which differs materially from that which is pos-
sessed by ordinary property, and the claims of science upon them and
upon the investigator with relation to them at once begin. These
claims, as just intimated, require that a careful descriptive record be
made of the stratigraphical conditions under which the fossils are found,
including a directive record of the locality and designation of the
stratum from which they were obtained. They also require that these
records should be inviolably preserved and made inseparable from every
specimen by indices that shall be as intelligible to other investigators
as to the original observer.

Aside from the claims of science such precaution is necessary, because
reliance upon memory alone is always unsafe in the most favorable
cases, and it can at best give rise only to such oral traditions as are
out of place in scientific work. The immediate preparation of the
records and indices just mentioned is also necessary, because, while
every specimen is at all times competent to impart to an investigator all
obtainable knowledge of its own character, it can of itself convey no
information as to its original locality and stratigraphic position. With
this information secured for a collection of fossils they may be made at
all times available as aids to scientific research not only by the collector,
but by all other investigators.

The claims of science also require that immediately upon the com-
pletion of the original study of fossils thus collected and recorded
they shall be placed where they will be freely accessible to the scien-
tific public, and that reference to their place of deposit shall be made
in connection with their publication. It is needless to say that the
only suitable places for such deposit are public museums. It is only
when this indispensable evidence is thus made accessible that the publie
san exercise that arbitration over the accumulated results of the labors
of investigators which has been shown to be imperative.

The preparation and publication of complete records concerning the
locality and strata from which fossil remains are obtained are necessary
even from a biological point of view alone, especially when those remains
are studied with reference to the range of organic forms in time, and
without such records fossil remains are comparatively worthless as aids
in geological investigation, It is unfortunately true that a not unimpor-
366 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

tant proportion of the paleontological material contained in our best
museums is without these essential records, and that many of the publi-
cations containing descriptions and illustrations of fossil remains give no
satisfactory information as to the localities and strata from which they
were obtained or of the final disposition of the specimens. In such cases
those authors and collectors have evidently assumed to decide for
themselves and for science the exact taxonomic position in the geolog-
ical scale of the strata from which their fossils came. In omitting such
records as have been referred to they seem to have considered any
information unnecessary that would enable the scientific public to
repeat their observations upon their specimens or those which they
may have made in the field, or to learn the biological characteristics of
the formations from which their collections were obtained other than
those which may be suggested by their own partial collections and their
necessarily imperfect descriptions. It is doubtless true that such omis-
sions have been largely due to an honest lack of appreciation on the
part of authors and collectors of the importance of preserving such
records, but it is to be feared that in some important cases the omis-
sions or suppressions have been intentional. In the former class of
cases the fact can only be deplored, but in the latter every geologist is
justified in feeling that a crime has been committed against science.

The claims of geological science upon associations and societies are
so generally and justly recognized that only the one which relates to
the manner of publishing the results of investigation need be referred
to in this connection, and this reference will be confined to the necessity
of enforcing the claims upon individual investigators which have al-
ready been discussed. This claim may be sufficiently indicated by ref-
erence to those last mentioned, and by the remark that if it is the duty
of individuals to publish records of their observations in the manner
that has been stated, it is plainly the duty of those persons who may be
in charge of the means of publication to refuse to publish the writings
of those authors who do not conform to that requirement.

The facts and principles which have been stated in the preceding
essays fully warrant the statements made on foregoing pages of this
one, that individual authority can have no existence with relation to
geological science, that the public must be the final arbiter of all ques-
tions concerning the value of proposed contributions to its advance-
ment, and that a public exposition should be made of the evidence upon
which any contribution to biological geology is based. In accordance
with the last-named requirement it is necessary to consider the claims
of this branch of science upon museums, the force of which is apparent
when it is remembered that the material pertaining to it therein stored
constitutes the vital evidence of the value of all contributions to its
advancement, and that without such evidence this branch of science
would be reduced to a mass of personal testimony.

in view of the great scientific value of fossil remains the following
RELATION OF BIOLOGY TO GEOLOGICAL INVESTIGATION. 367

remarks are offered concerning the precautions which are necessary in
their preservation. It is true that most if not all these precautions
are observed in a large part of the principal scientific museums of the
world, but it is also true that much remissness in this respect has
occurred in others. Besides the propriety of referring to the latter facet,
these remarks are necessary to complete ny statement of the claims of
science which constitute the subject of this essay.

Three general classes of specimens of fossil remains should be rec-
ognized in museum collections, namely, typical, authenticated, and
unauthenticated. Under the head of typical or type specimens are
included not only those which have been described and figured in any
publication, whether original or otherwise, but those which have in any
public manner been so used or referred to. While all such specimens
as these should at all times be accessible to any competent investiga-
tor, the risk of loss or injury is so great that they should in no case be
allowed to be taken from the museum building in which they are in-
stalled. Such specimens are in a peculiar sense unique, and there can
be no substitution and no equivalent in value. Their loss greatly re-
duces the value of every publication any part of which is based upon
them, and to that extent retards the advancement of science. It is not
enough that other, and even better, specimens of presumably the same
species may be discovered; the former constitute the original, the latter
only supposititious evidence. Besides the risk of loss or injury to type
specimens by removal from the place of their installment their absence
is a disadvantage to science. That is, no one investigator should be
allowed their use to the exclusion of any other.

The term “authenticated specimens” is here applied to such as have
been studied and annotated by competent investigators and properly
installed. Such material constitutes the bulk of every important mu-
seum collection, and next to the type specimens already mentioned
they are most valuable. Their increased value is due to the scientific
labor that has been bestowed upon them, and it needs only the addi-
tional labor of publication to. constitute them type specimens and to
make them of like value. Authenticated specimens when installed are
ready aids to all investigators of such value that even the temporary
removal of any of them from a public museum is, to say the least, of
doubtful expediency.

Unauthenticated specimens are, of course, those which have not been
studied and installed, and they constitute the great mass of material
from which authenticated and type specimens are drawn. Among
them are those which constitute the material evidence upon which
original observations in biological geology are based. If these are
accompanied by the records and descriptive notes which ona preceding
page have been shown to be essential to their value, they constitute
proper material for acceptance by museum authorities, but if not their
installment should be refused, whatever their character may be. That
368 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

is, to apply a statement made in another connection, no specimen of
fossil remains should be admitted to permanent installation in any pub-
lic museum which is not accompanied by such a record of the locality
and stratum from which it was obtained as will enable any investiga-
tor to revisit the same. In every case of installment such records
should be so connected with every specimen as to be readily accessi-
ble, and so arranged that the danger of loss or disconnection shall be
reduced to a minimum.

The foregoing discussion of the claims of science upon museums is
intended to embrace reterence only to those which are devoted to the
preservation of material pertaining to biological geology, but they are
of more or less general applicability. These partial claims alone dem-
onstrate the important relation that museums hold to science and to
civilization as centers of learning and conservatories of the evidence
concerning acquired knowledge. Museums should not only be made
safe treasure-houses of science, but they should be what their name
implies—temples of study—perpetually open to all investigators.

The claims of science upon geological organizations can not be dis-
cussed at length in this essay, but because the ratio of power for the
advancement or retardation of science possessed by such organizations
is so much greater than that of individuals working independently, it
is desirable to make this brief reference to them. That power increases
also with the ratio of the extent of the organization, and it is largely
centered in the director. His responsibility, especially if his organi-
zation is a large one, is peculiar, and, to himself, of an unfortunate
character. That is, while all or nearly all the advancement of science
that may be accomplished by the organization is the work of his subor-
dinates, retardation, if it should occur, is mainly due to his failure to
require that each branch of investigation should be prosecuted in ac-
cord with all others, and the case would be little less than disastrous
should he himself favor er parte methods or fail to require a symmetrical
development of the work in his charge. The claims of science upon
geological organizations are therefore really claims upon their directors,
and they are more responsible than any other class of persons for the
preservation of the integrity of geological science.
SCIENTIFIC TAXIDERMY FOR MUSEUMS.

(BASED ON A STUDY OF THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT COLLEC-
TIONS.)

By R. W. SHUFELDT, M. D.

In a valued communication, dated January 16, 1895, the present
writer was honored by a request from the United States National
Museum to furnish to it a paper upon what may briefly be termed
“scientific taxidermy” in its widest sense. My attention was espe-
cially invited to the progress that had been made in the art of taxi-
dermy, as exemplified on the part of the various methods used in the
preparation of, and the modes of mounting resorted to, in the case
of all kinds of animals for museum exhibition. It was proposed
that in a general way this study should review the field, in so far as
the collections contained in the U. 8S. National Museum and Smith-
sonian Institution were concerned, from those times when specimens of
mounted animals were first being made by those institutions to the day
when the opening of the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago per-
mitted people to see, in the varied groups and single examples of pre-
served animals from nearly every department in nature sent there,
what could be accomplished in such matters through the operations of
skilled moderns in the taxidermic art. What was expected of me was
further definitely defined, in the letter to which reference is made above,
in the following words: ‘ We should like to have your unbiased opinion
of the different pieces and kinds of work, whether favorable or unfavor-
able, and should be glad to have you indicate, so far as you feel dis-
posed to do so, what lines of work, in your opinion, promise the best
results if carried further, and what you think should be abandoned.”
This injunction, when faithfully performed in the case of any art what-
soever, is the only proper test of our progress in it, and it is through
comparison alone of early accomplishments, work recently performed,
and what is being done in the particular line at the moment, that we
can inform ourselves precisely where we stand. Very soon it became
possible for me to direct my attention to this matter, and a preliminary
overlook of the field convinced me that my chief duty lay in making
just criticism of the results attained on: the part of the artist in tax-
idermy, rather than an enumeration and description of all the details of

370 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

technique of that art. Much that refers to the last-named class of work
has been and will be shortly still more thoroughly set forth in certain
papers and reports published by the National Museum. Some valuable
instructions of that kind, I understand, are in press at the present
writing, and ere long the scientific taxidermist will have before him
all that refers to correct methods of the mounting of animals, as well
as plastic modeling and everything that has any bearing thereupon.

The present paper, then, will have little or nothing to do with what
might properly be called the chemistry and mechanics of taxidermy,
but will rather deal with it from the standpoint of the art student and
biologist. At some points these two lines, however, converge, but never
distinctly intersect each other; and my chief object will have been
attained, if this paper proves itself to be a useful adjunct to the others
upon kindred lines of inquiry. Properly, it will fill the place of the last
of the series, for the reasons that have just been stated.

History goes to show that there has been just as much of an evolu-
lution, of progressive advancement, in the science and art of taxidermy
as there has been in the case of the necessity for, the growth and im-
provement in the building of, the stocking, and the management of
museums. To a very large extent these two developments have been
pari passu in nature, and, in one sense, they are quite dependent upon
each other. To instance my meaning, it may be said that a handsome,
instructive, and scientifically preserved group of animals may utterly
fail of a useful purpose by being placed upon exhibition in some poorly
lighted, indifferently ventilated, and otherwise unsuitable museum-hall;
while on the other hand no amount of architectural beauty and perfect-
ness in the latter will ever serve to shield a group of animals that have
been mounted by a person ignorant in all the departments of scientific
taxidermy, from the criticism that work of that kind is sure to have
continually poured down upon it by the intelligent natural historian.

It can be shown, then, that the taxidermie art, as in the case of all
the arts and sciences, has had its dawn, having been nursed in a cradle
of crude beginnings, far back in history, and since which time it has
enjoyed a very remarkable career of development. To me there is no
doubt but what it came into being with such pristine pursuits as pre-
historic tanning, the embalming of the human body, and those of cer-
tain domestic animals as the cats and dogs found in prehistoric remains
of Egypt and elsewhere. Sure it is that Hanno, the very ancient Car-
thaginian navigator, in the record that he has left us of his African ex-
plorations, made five centuries before Christ, gives an account of his
discovery of the gorilla, and “having killed and flayed them, we con-
veyed their skins to Carthage.” There they were preserved for many
generations, and are, no doubt, the Gorgones described by Pliny (146
Bac):

Our own Pueblan Indians, as the Zunians and others, make very
good “flat skins” of small birds to-day, an art no doubt traceable in
“SCIENTIFIC TAXIDERMY FOR MUSEUMS. ail

them to the Mexicans, and the latter have probably practiced it for
ages.

Montezuma, as stated by Cortez, possessed robes covered with the
skins of the Trogan and other brilliantly plumaged birds. From the
making of these flat skins for personal ornament to the desire to pre-
serve in their natural appearance similar forms, as well as other small
animals of all kinds, for the ornamentation of habitations, is both easy
to be imagined, and very probable what took place. Gradually there
was a demand for that kind of work, and it fell to the hands of those
most skilled in its performance. They were the early taxidermists.
Before specialization was ever dreamed of for the early arts of whatso-
ever kind, there always, so history teaches, existed a kind of an aftinity
bonding more or less closely together, the naturalist, the medical man,
and the conservator of the curious in nature. Shakespeare’s portrayal
of the London apothecary is illustrative of this, within whose

Needy shop a tortoise hung,
An alligator stuffed, and other skins
Of ill-shaped fishes.

Complete differentiation in certain quarters, in these days of the
manhood of those sciences, has not as yet been thoroughly brought
about, and even in some of the old German cities of the present time
we yet hear of organizations known as “ The Society of Naturalists and
Physicians,” and in some of our own late expeditions made under the
auspices of the Government, the duties of ‘surgeon and naturalist”
are relegated to one individual.

Now, although the mere preserving the skins of animals is an opera.
tion to be easily traced back through nearly all races of people to the
dawn of history, this does not altogether hold true with the ‘ mount-
ing” of animals.*

Taxidermists are quite agreed that this phase of the art is of com-
paratively quite modern origin. For instance, Montagu Browne has
remarked that—

Little is known of the beginnings of the practice of the ‘‘stuffing” or ‘setting
up” of animals for ornament or for scientific purposes; and it is highly probable,
from what we gather from old works of travel or natural history, that the art is not
more than some three hundred years old. It was practiced in England towards the
end of the seventeenth century, as is proved by the Sloane collection. which in 1725
formed the nucleus of the collection of natural history now lodged in the galleries
at South Kensington.

It was not until the middle of last century that any treatise devoted to the prin-
ciples of the then little-understood art was published in France, Réaumer’s treatise
(1749) being probably the first. This was followed at intervals by others in France
and Oya until the beginning of the BE sent eRe when the English began

to move in the matter, and several works were published, notably those by E. Don-
ovan,* W. Swainson,t Capt. Thomas Brown,} and others. These works, however,
are now inadequate, and since the Great Exhibition of 1851, when the Germans and
French taught British taxidermists the rudiments of scientific treatment of natural
objects, several works have appeared upon the subject from the pens of American
and English authors, such as J. H. Batty,§ R. Ward,|| and Montagu Browne. ]

That the art is recent was also held by Dr. Holder, who, in an able
address given before the Society of American Taxidermists, said that
the—

First authentic examples in this comparatively new art with which we are familiar
are those produced through the patronage of the Prince Maximilian, of Nieu Wied,
Germany. This distinguished naturalist had spent several years in exploring the
bird region of North and South America. Equipped with every needful «ppliance
for successful research, he included in the personnel of his staff a practical taxider-
mist, and the numerous species of American birds and mammals, embracing many
types of great value, testify to the thorough exploration which the Prince accom-
plished in these regions. It was the good fortune of the American Museum of Nat-
ural History to come into possession of the entire collection of natural objects which
formed the well-known museum of this naturalist, and thus, through this collection,
we have representations of the earliest period of the art.

Among the numerous examples contained in the Maximilian collection are a num-
ber that yet bear the original label in the handwriting of the Prince. The frequent
occurrence of Meiner Reiser (my journey), accompanied by dates from 1812 upwards,
a period comprising a full three score years and ten, is recorded testimony of great
historical value. Unscathed as those specimens are by museum pests, they preseut
a most satisfactory evidence of the reliability of arsenical treatment as a means of
perpetuation well nigh indefinite. How much earlier the art was practiced we have
no definite knowledge. The numerous stuffed skins of reptiles, or rather mummies,
found in Egyptian tombs naturally claim our notice as perhaps the earliest exam-
ples.**

Extending over a very considerable period of duration we next find
the art of taxidermy passing through a stage of its development, of
which no end of examples quite parallel with it might be cited from

with a most valuable and useful Bibliography of Taxidermy (pp. 91-112), wherein

the early histories of other arts and sciences. Photography and chem-
istry are excellent instances of it. During the times to which I refer,
taxidermists both in this country and Europe, with but rare excep-
tions, could be grouped in two classes—the first, and by far the most
numerous, was chiefly represented by men coming from the lower
planes of society, who endeavored to throw as much mystery about
their operations as possible; in fact, to keep their art a secret one, and
if divulged at all, only done so at a high figure. The second class, as
a rule better nen socially, consisted of those who seemed to think that
to either be a taxidermist or even to publish anything on the subject,
required an humble apology to society. My private library contains
works illustrative of both these classes. The first is a miserable little
volume of some thirty pages published by its author, Mr. S. H. Sylves-
ter, at Middleboro, Mass., in 1865, and entitled ‘“*The Taxidermist’s
Manual, giving full instructions in mounting and preserving birds [ete. ],
sec. ed. (Price, $1.).”. Apart from the ridiculous meagreness of the
information it affords, a single leading page 1s entirely devoted to the
following ‘‘suggestion: ”

As coinmon things lose their charm, so is it more particularly in this art. A person
having this work should not leave it exposed to the eyes of the curious. The same
caution should be used in the practice. Work by yourself that none may know the
mysteries of the art, unless they are willing to pay for the information as you your-
self have done.

No less a book than the one published by Capt. Brown illustrates
the second class to which we have referred.* In his preface this author
remarks that—

In the following treatise it has been my object to attend more to rendering the
meaning clear than to elegance of language; and, besides, to get the work up in a
style at once creditable and moderate in price, so that it might be generally useful.
At the same time I have preferred avowing myself the author to publishing the work
anonymously, being firmly of opinion that no man should publish on a subject which
he is ashamed to acknowledge. (p. VI.)

Such a “suggestion” as has been given us by Mr. Sylvester will
never again appear upon the page of any standard work devoted to
the art of taxidermy and published by a civilized nation any more than
Capt. Brown’s thought of apologizing for the admirable little treatise
which he has given us on the subject will ever be repeated in a similar
work. Capt. Brown had the less to be “ashamed” of in his book, for
in his introduction he places himself upon the record by his observa-
tions as being one of the very first to sound the keynote, which, swell.
ing through the last quarter of a century, has had its due influence in
lifting taxidermy from the realm of an ignoble pursuit to the broad

platform of one of the most important and exact of all the sciences.
I refer to the paragraph in which he has said:

Although considerable advances have been made of late years in the art of taxi-
dermy, it is still far from perfection. This is to be attributed, in a great measure,
to the education of the persons who practice this art; for among all I have met
with employed in the preservation of animals, none have had the advantage of
anatomical study, which is quite indispensable to the perfection of stuffing. One or
two individuals, it is true, have attended to the structure of the skeleton of man
and a few of the more common animals, but this is far from the information which
they ought to possess; for nothing short of a general and extensive knowledge of
comparative anatomy can qualify them sufficiently for an art which is so compre-
hensive and varied in its application (pp. 2, 3).

Prophetie words, indeed, and not in a few quarters has the prophecy
of this distinguished authority been largely fulfilled. More light, how-
ever, is needed in other places, and in many of our museums of the
very highest standing the examples of taxidermy they offer us are
far, very far from our ideal of what they should be.

Charles Waterton is another worthy name that must not be forgotten
here, and fully seventy years ago, in his Wanderings in South America,
he wrote,in his quaint and impressive old style, yet pregnant with
truth:

Were you to pay as much attention to birds as the sculptor does to the human frame,
you would immediately see on entering a museum that the specimens are not well
done. This remark will not be thought severe, when you reflect that that which
was once alive has probably been stretched, stuffed, stiffened, and wired by the
hand of a common clown. Consider, likewise, how the plumage must have been
disordered by too much stretching or drying, and, perhaps, sullied, or at least
deranged, by the pressure of a coarse and heavy hand—plumage which, ere life had
fled within it, was accustomed to be touched by nothing rougher than the dew of
heaven and the pure and gentle breath of air.

These are potent words as coming from the pen of a man who wrote
them within a year or two of three-quarters of a century ago. Espe-
cially is this the case when that ingenious naturalist in the same work
enjoins that—

If you wish to be in ornithology what Angelo was in sculpture, you must apply to
profound study and your own genius to assist you.

You must have a complete knowledge of ornithological anatomy. You must pay
close attention to the form and attitude of the bird, and know exactly the propor-
tion each curve, or extension, or contraction, or expansion of any particular part
bears to the rest of the body. In a word you must possess Promethean boldness,
and bring down fire and animation, as it were, into your preserved specimen.

“Repair to the haunts of birds on plains and mountains, forests,
swamps, and lakes, and give up your time to examine the economy of
the different orders of birds,” is also the kind of study Waterton
recommended in 1825 to those who desired to preserve birds in their
strictly natural attitudes as they assumed them in life and in nature.

Standing almost alone as he did as a sound instructor of the tax-
idermic art in the first quarter of the present century, he is represented
SCIENTIFIC TAXIDERMY FOR MUSEUMS. 375

at this writing, or in the very last part of the century’s last quarter,
by scores of teachers in Europe and America who entertain precisely
similar opinions. Not only this, but recruits are rapidly coming to the
ranks as time hastens on, and it is quite safe to predict that in another
century, or even less, the old-time ‘ bird-stuffer” will cease to be found
‘in the flesh” among us.

Already I have given above, in the words of Montagu Browne, who
have been the chief promoters of this art in Great Britain; other na-
tions also have in this way powerfully contributed to the material prog-
ress of taxidermy. In France the immortal names of Verreaux, Verdey,
and others had a most beneficial influence; and our own country has
been by no means backward in this particular.

Within the past ten years or more the published opinions of a num-
ber of these writers are the best evidences upon the substantial nature
of the progress of this science that we can here adduce, and by quot-
ing some of them I resort to the most effective means in my power to
illustrate what taxidermy has attained to in those places where its
standard is now considered to be at the highest plane of its present
development.

Turning again to the article Taxidermy, by Mr. Montagu Browne,
already referred to above, we find him concluding it thus:

A new school of taxidermy, with new methods, whose aim is to combine knowl-
edge of anatomy and modeling with taxidermic technique, are now coming to the
front, and the next generation will discard all processes of ‘‘ stuffing” in favor of
modeling. Within the limits of an article like the present it is impossible to do
more than glance at the intricate processes involved in this. In the case of mam-
mals, after the skin has been completely removed, even to the toes, a copy is
made of the body, posed as in life, and from this an accurate representation of form,
including delineation of muscles, ete., is built up in light materials; the model is
then covered with the skin, which is damped and pinned in to follow every depres-
sion and prominence; the study is then suftered to dry, and, models having been
made, in the case of large animals, of the mucous membrane of the jaws, palate,
tongue, and lips, these are truthfully reproduced in plastic material. The ordinary
glass eyes are discarded, and hollow globes, specially made, are hand-painted from
nature, and are fixed in the head so as to convey the exact expression which the
pose of the body demands. Birds, if of any size, cam be modeled in like manner,
and fishes are treated by a nearly identical process, being finally colored as in a ‘‘still-
life” painting.

To give a life-like appearance, attention is also paid to artistic “mounting.” By
this is meant the surrounding of specimens with appropriate accessories, and it is
well exemplified by the new work shown in the natural history museum at South
Kensington, where, for example, birds are arranged as in a state of nature, feeding,
or flying to their young, sitting on their eggs, swimming in miniature pools, or
preening their feathers whilst perched lovingly side by side, and surrounded by
exquisitely modeled foliage and flowers. ‘This, with correct modeling of the speci-
mens, Which, except in rare instances, is not quite so striking in the new groups,
indicates the future of the art, the hope of which lies in the better education of tax-
idermists as designers, artists, and modelers.

Not only should they be better instructed in designing, in art, and in
modeling, but, what is quite as important, they should be trained espe-

cially in the power of correct observation in animal morphology, and
in other matters which will be enumerated further along.

Dr. Sharpe has given us a very able article touching upon the ques-
tion of artistic taxidermy.* He says:

At Leyden, where a staff of trained taxidermists is kept in the museum, some
attempt has been made to vary the usual mode of stuffing animals by representing
them in varied and active positions, and thus the general effect is never monotonous.
But this was never done in the British Museum, and the constrained attitudes of
many of the specimens exhibited at Kensington form part of a legacy from the pa-
rent institution, the bad influence of which it will take many years to efface. Thou-
sands of specimens have been unmounted already or have been transferred to the
duplicates and distributed to such provincial museums as prefer to tread in the old
paths, and will accept specimens belonging to the bad old times.

The credit of having broken away from time-honored tradition, in the mode of
mounting animals in this country is certainly due to Mr. John Hancock, who taught
how to combine scientific accuracy and artistic feeling. Mr. Hancock’s name is at
Password throughout England wherever taxidermy is mentioned, and in London
his ablest representative has probably been Mr. A. D. Bartlett, the well-known
superintendent of the zodlogical gardens, to whom we owe many of our most beauti-
fully mounted specimens in the bird gallery. But the first to suggest this combina-
tion of art and taxidermy for an entire museum, was undoubtedly Mr. E. T. Booth, of
Brighton, whose collection of British birds in the Dyke Road Museum, still remains
one of the sights of England, and is not surpassed in interest by any natural history
exhibition in the whole world. Here may actually be seen our native birds in their
haunts, every species being represented as in a wild state, with corresponding nat-
ural accessories, reproducing as nearly as possible the surroundings as they were
when the birds were alive, and representing the scenes sketched by the collector
at the time of eapture. Many years before we actually saw Mr. Booth’s collection,
its fame had reached our ears, and the idea seemed to us to indicate what the museum
of the future, ought to be; thus we lost no opportunity of advocating this system of
artistic taxidermy in all our public lectures. At Leicester the notion was well
received, and some groups of British birds were mounted under the auspices of the
natural history committee of the town museum, until by the appointment of Mr.
Montague Brown, as the curator of the museum, Leicester obtained the services of a
taxidermist as skilled as he is energetic, and the result has been that the system of
natural mounting has been extended to the entire collection of birds, so that not
only Pritish, but foreign species are represeuted with their familiar surroundings in
a state of nature. The Leicester Museum is the only one which has applied the
principle in its entirety with the utmost success and public appreciation. * * *

And further along in his article, and referring to the series of the
groups of British small birds and their nests in the South Kensington
Museum, Dr. Sharpe adds:

In this corridor are placed most of the smaller perching birds, some of the artistic
work being very satisfactory. The mounting of the specimens has been done by Mr.
Pickhardt, who, when he exercises his full powers, is probably without a rival as a
bird-stuffer, and the majority of the plants have been reproduced ly Messrs. Min-
torn, of Soho Square, but a great deal of the arrangement of the cases is done in the
taxidermist’s room of the museum by Mr. James West, one of the staff. And here it

must be explained that the groups of British birds exhibited are absolutely true to
nature, the birds being in every case the actual ones which built the nest in the
identical situation reproduced in the case.

So wonderfully interesting is Sharpe’s article that the writer would
fain republish here every word of it, but we must hasten on to the
expression of opinions of others.

When commenting upon the “Common Faults in the Mounting of
Quadrupeds,” our veteran taxidermist, Mr. William T. Hornaday, has
said:

The task of the taxidermist, if properly appreciated, is a grave and serious one.
It is not to depict the mere outline of an animal on paper or canvas and represent
its covering of hair, feathers, or scales; nor is it to build up a figure of yielding clay
and cast it in plaster. It is to impart toa shapeless skin the exact size, the form,
the attitude, the look of life. It is to recreate the animal, or at least so much of it
as appeals to the eye; to give it all that nature gave it except the vital spark. It
should be an exact copy, as if it were a cast of the animal as fashioned by nature’s
cunning hand. It must stand the crucial test of being viewed from all points—from
the side, the front, from behind, above, and below.

More than all this, the animal must be prepared to stand the test of time. It must
not swerve from its poise; it must not shrink nor change its form; it must retain its
smoothness and resist the ravages of destroying insects. *

Mr. Hornaday, it will be remembered, was at one time in charge of
the taxidermical department of the U.S. National Museum, and many
of his most successful accomplishments, grand groups of our larger
mammals, preserved in the most masterly style, are in the cases of that
institution—silent attests to the durabfity and thoroughness of his
work. A number of these will be noticed further on in the present
paper.

There was much in Mr. Hornaday’s studio at the National Museum
that reminded me of the workshop of that giant among American
taxidermists of his time, the late John G. Bell, of New York. There
IT met him over a quarter of a century ago. His place was some-
where down upon Broadway, and his room upon the second or third
story of the building. At the entrance door downstairs was a small
vase containing a mounted searlet ibis and a few other birds, to
invite attention to those in search of his rooms above. At that time,
about 1868, | was a student of one of Mr. Bell’s best graduates, Mr.
James W. Jenkins, now of Madison, Il., and very well do I remember
my first introduction to that Broadway establishment. I had been
engaged by Prof. Albert S. Bickmore to accompany, as naturalist,
one of the Polar expeditions, then organizing, to make collections for
the American Museum of Natural History, and had been sent with
specimens of my bird-skins to Mr. Bell to have him pronounce upon
them and my work generally, with the view of having his opinion
on my fitness for the position. As I entered the room I observed
an old red fox chained to a bolt in the wall, but lying down with

378 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

his head between his forepaws and eyes upturned in my direction.
On the floor in his immediate neighborhood were a number of beauti-
fuliy mounted birds on stands, and fearing lest the animal should
suddenly arise if I came farther into the apartment, and do some dam-
age, I started to pass round and give him as wide a berth as possibie.
The room was small, and Mr. Bell was engaged with a couple of stu-
dents at a window opposite where I entered, but he turned in time to
see my detour around the fox, and did not spare me in his merriment
at my thinking the animal was alive. To some extent, however, he
mitigated my chagrin by saying he had deceived over a hundred vis-
itors with that fox during the five years it had lain there. I could not
help but admire his tall and well-knit frame, his piercing blue eyes,
and general bearing. His specimens too, which I examined, were per-
fect works of art, and, as all know who have ever had a similar oppor-
tunity to study them, were the admiration and the envy of the taxi-
dermists of those days, now long gone by.

Of all the taxidermical institutions, however, that this country has
developed none can in any way compare with the natural science estab-
lishment of Prof. H. A. Ward, of Rochester, N. Y. Not only has Prof.
Ward powerfully influenced for good the growth of the art in America,
or wemay truthfully say throughout the civilized world, but he has by
inspiring others with his enthusiasm and energy built up a school of
advanced taxidermists that are worthy emulators of his skill, and who
have with marked ability passed the torch in many directions. There
is not a museum in our land at all entitled to bear the name that is not
in some way, whether directly or indirectly, indebted to him for im-
provements of all kinds in its taxidermie methods, and the proper
modes of exhibiting materials illustrative of the kindred arts and
sciences.

Mr. F. A. Lucas, who has done so much to develop the exhibiting of
osteological subjects, and models and specimens of both vertebrates
and invertebrates at the U. 8S. National Museum owes much of his sue-
cess to his early training under Prof. Ward, and the art is not only
under lasting obligations to him, but through his wise teaching it has
been firmly and permanently placed in that quarter upon a safe and
lasting basis. That Mr. Lucas appreciates “The scope and needs of
taxidermy” in their truest sense no one can doubt who has ever read
his article of that title in the Third Annual Report of the Society of
American Taxidermists.

Mr. Frederic S. Webster is another of whose writings and produc.
tions the country has every reason to be proud, and the high standard
of work so constantly put forth by that artist has always had a most
beneficial effect upon the younger aspirants in the United States.

Attention of American and European students has also been drawn
from the old-time museum models in taxidermy and directed to a closer
SCIENTIFIC TAXIDERMY FOR MUSEUMS. 879

copying of nature through the far-reaching works of Dr. Elliott Coues,
who has said, in his Key to North American Birds:

Faultless mounting [of birds] is an art really difficult, acquired by few; the aver-
age work done in this line shows something of caricature, ludicrous or repulsive, as
the case may be. To copy nature faithfully by taxidermy requires not only long
and close study, but an artistic sense; and this last is a rare gift. Unless you have
at least the germs of the faculty in your composition, your taxidermical suecess will
be incommensurate with the time and trouble you bestow. My own taxidermical
art is of a low order, decidedly not above average. Although I have mounted a
great many birds that would compare very favorably with ordinary museum work,
few of them have entirely answered my ideas. A live bird is to me such a beautiful
object that the slightest taxidermical flaw in the effort to represent it is painfully
offensive. Perhaps this makes me place the standard of excellence too high for
practical purposes (p. 40, 2d ed., 1884).

Powerful impulses of the best kind have often been instilled into the
art through the patronage and guidance of those who have at different
times in their careers been either directors of, or curators in, our larger
museums. I speak especially in this country of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution and the National Museum.

Through the wise and ever-operative influence of our great Nestor of
all the sciences zodlogical, Prof. Spencer F. Baird, he so directed the
management of those institutions when under his administration that
their workshops came to be the great drill ground for many of the most
deserving who possessed the evidences of success in skillfully preserv-
ing all manner of objects illustrative of the various classes of the animal
kingdom. {

What has been the outcome of much of his wisdom we hope to por-
tray, however faintly, in the following pages. Most ably has Prof.
Baird’s influence been fostered and furthered by the succeeding efforts
along similar lines of those who are his successors in the administration
of the Museum and who at the present time are doing so much to give
actual shape and form to what before was simply in outline and erude
beginnings. Where such influence tells the best is in the directing of
the skilled efforts of the taxidermie artist in those cases where the lat-
ter, through lack of opportunity, fails to possess the requisite knowledge
of the forms and habits of many of the world’s rarer animals. Indeed,
frequently some of the best group pieces of mounted mammals, birds,
and others, have resulted from the combined knowledge and skill of the
capable zodlogist on the one hand and the trained taxidermist upon the
other. Nota few of such groups are to be found in the collections of
the Government museums.

Very often it will be seen, then,in the future, I think, that fine, realistic
groups of mounted animals will be produced that will be composites;
in other words, will be the resultant of the combined labors of the
biologist, the taxidermist, the modeler, and the designer and artist.
Rarely will all these prerequisites be found inone man, though oceasion-
ally undoubtedly it will be so; then the museum which can claim his
services will be very fortunate.
380) REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Among many others who have been more or less influential in insist-
ing upon the highest standard for the art, in each and all of its
branches, we must not forget the distinguished names of Joseph H.
Batty, the author of a number of works upon practical taxidermy ;

». J. Maynard, the well-known writer of the The Naturalist’s Guide;
Prof. J. W. P. Jenks, who, through a long and honorable career, has
never ceased his efforts in not only doing much for taxidermy, but in
the introduction of study series of animals in the public sehools in
New England and elsewhere; and a host of other worthy promoters,

At the National Museum, at Washington, in recent times, in addition
to the fine group pieces of Hornaday and of Lucas, there has been
some masterly work done in the taxidermie art by Mr. Joseph Palmer,
and his son, Mr. William Palmer; also by Mr. Nelson R. Wood and
Mr. Henry Denslow, the nature of which I have already noticed in a
popular article published in The Great Divide, of Denver, Colo., for
December, 1892, and which will be referred to again in the present
connection.

From the opinions, then, of the European and American taxidermists
as I have thus far quoted them, it is evident that the general develop-
ment of the art shows at this time very marked improvement, and the
tendency among its votaries is to raise it to the highest possible stand-
ard of excellence. With such a movement the writer is in the most
hearty sympathy, and I ain of the opinion that the day is not far dis-
tant when taxidermy will find its lawful place on the platform of the
most highly cultivated of the arts. Asa matter of fact it has every
right in reason to stand side by side with painting and with sculpture,
and its students need have no fears in claiming such a station for it.

To be a scientific taxidermist requires, or should require, in the first
instance, a very thorough education, quite equal to that given by our
best colieges. He should have a complete training in biology, with
especial emphasis having been placed upon his studies in comparative
morphology, so as to be familiar, as far as possible, with the vertebrate
skeleton and topographical anatomy, to include more particularly the
study of the superficial muscles of vertebrates. He should have such
a conception of physics as to be able to decide upon the possible and
the impossible in animal postures. In a way, he should be a good ar-
tist, be enabled to use the photographic camera, and make intelligent
sketches of animals of all kinds and their natural haunts. He should
be fully abreast of the times in all taxidermic technique per se, and
possess fine mechanical skill.

As full a knowledge as can be attained of the habits of animals from
personal observations should be added, as well as a constitutional de-
sire to become familiar through current literature of all advances made
from time to time in his art, and a healthy ambition to ever utilize them
and improve upon the same.

So far as human ability is concerned, were I at this moment called
SCIENTIFIC TAXIDERMY FOR MUSEUMS. 381

upon to decide as to the relative merits of the talent required to paint
a life-size elephant, to sculpture one in stone, or to properly preserve one
in a natural position and color so it would safely resist the ravages of
time and all else that might injure it, I should not hesitate a moment
in rendering an opinion, for I should say it lay with the seientifie tax-
idermic artist.. Mind you, when I do thus decide I have had in my life-
time, with specimens of smaller animals, experience with all. At the
best, however, the difference is but of very small degree, and yet the
taxidermist, in a way, should be master of both the art of the painter
and the art of the seulptor, for frequently he has to use the brush with
ereat fidelity to nature, and the time is fast coming on when he must
be able to build up, in clay at least, the entire forms of the larger ani-
mals which he aims to preserve.

Next, it may be asked, Why a collegiate education? Simply because
I believe a man in any calling is a better man in every way for having
received the four years’ training which a university gives him. And
surely neither the taxidermist, nor the artist, nor the sculptor offer any
exception to the rule. Moreover, everything that the skilled taxider-
mist would acquire in a college course would materially assist him in
his profession in his subsequent career. Whatever may have been
written, and whatever may have been said on the broad question of
the college nan versus the self-made man, it has been my experience
that the kind of men that bring our country the most desirable recog-
nition from other nations are those who have received a liberal educa-
tion. A taxidermist should be a good ge ieral biologist, and he should
pay especial attention to the habits of all animals in nature; the geo-
graphical ranges of faunwe; breeding habits; the peculiar habits in-
dulged in by various kinds of animals; their naturalresorts during times
of feeding, amusement, or conducting their young. Plants of all kinds
should with scrupulous care be studied from the taxidermist’s stand-
point, as well as the localities where they grow, nature of surfaces of
the ground, and all else presented on the part of field, ocean, stream,
and forest. Nothing should eseape his constant study of such matters,
and, above all else, he should cultivate the faculty of patience. An
impatient man, it may be safely said, can never attain to the highest
position the art has in its power of giving him.

In comparative morphology, as I have said, he should devote a great
deal of time to the skeleton and to topographical anatomy. The study
of the skeleton is of the very highest importance, as without a knowl-
edge of it there is no hope at all of a man being a perfect taxidermist
in all its varied departments. Normal movements of the articulations
and the ligaments that control them should receive most careful consid-
eration, and no opportunity lost to study such matters scientifically
upon all kinds of animal cadavers. Special drawings made by the
taxidermist should record special points observed and worked out—the
possibilities in normal movements and postures as exhibited by the
382 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

osseous system. In its entirety, however, this can not be fully appre-
ciated without a full knowledge of the muscular system, for there are
possible movements that the skeleton, when cleaned and dried, is capa-
ble of making, which, in life, become impossible from the operation of
muscles and tendons. So myology must be systematically studied
pari passu with the subject of skeletology, and with the aim constantly
in view of acquiring a clear insight into the normal postures of animals.

This leads to the consideration of the question of correct form, and
to acquire that requires prolonged research and study upon the entire
subject of topographical anatomy. Muscles extended; muscles con-
tracted; muscles at rest; contours formed by the normal deposit of adi-
pose tissue; contours formed by parts of the skeleton that are merely
subcutaneous; contours formed by the presence of glands of all kinds,
of sesamoidal bones, cartilages, and every other structure that may in
any way affect the normal contour of an animal. To this must be added
the careful study of all external characters proper, as the hair and
analogous parts, throughout the animal kingdom—the eyes and their
surroundings, the nasal structures, the mouth of all vertebrates and
invertebrates. Indeed, there is not a point properly falling within the
range of topographical anatomy in its very widest sense that should be
beneath the special notice of the taxidermist.

Colors of parts should also receive marked attention; and the taxi-
dermist should keep a notebook devoted to that one branch alone.
Never should an opportunity be lost to record by actual painted
sketches the colors of every external anatomical character presented
onthe part of any animal whatsoever. Zoology itself would be far freer
from gross errors of the color descriptions of animals were naturalists,
as a rule, more careful in such matters. This is marked by the case in
ichthyology and in the naked skin-tracks of mammals and birds. We,
then, are naturally led to the question of drawing and painting; and no
one will doubt the necessity of a taxidermist being more or less pro-
ficient in all these branches. But none of them will be of any service
to him unless the power be supplemented by the more important fac-
ulty of being a correct observer, and to be a correct observer is to see
and appreciate things as they really exist. Taxidermists should have
a knowledge of not only making correct sketches of all kinds of animals
and their haunts and of plants and coloring them correctly, but they
should be enabled to use such instruments as are demanded in making
reduced drawings correctly from large subjects. Coloring in oil is also
of great value in restoring the tints in some cases on the skins of pre-
served animals, and the student in this art should constantly aim to
cultivate his sense of color appreciation and of the matching of all the
various shades.

More or less pertinent to this question, Capt. Thomas Brown has
said: *

*Taxidermist’s Manual, pp. 3, 4.
SCIENTIFIC TAXIDERMY FOR MUSEUMS. 383

A knowledge of drawing and modeling are also indispensable qualifications, to
enable the stuffer to place his subject in a position both natural and striking. It is
the too-frequent practice for the stuffer to set about preserving the animal without
having determined in what attitude he is to place it, so that it will appear to most
advantage and bein character with the ordinary habits of the creature. This he leaves
to the last efforts of finishing his work, and, consequently, its proportions and
character are likely to be devoid of all appearance of animation.

The first thing, therefore to be attended to in all great national natural history
establishments is to choose young persons who are yet in their boyhood to be in-
structed in this art most important to science. Their studies should be commenced
by deep attention to drawing, modeling, anatomy, chemistry, while they at the
same time proceed with the practical part of their art. Every opportunity of ex-
amining the habits and actions of the living subject should be embraced and its atti-
tudes and general aspect caréfully noted. Without strict attention to these points,
so manifestly obvious, the art of preserving animals never will attain that degree of
perfection which its importance demands. On the other hand, if this art is pursued
in the manner here recommended, artists may be produced who will fulfill the ob-
jects of their profession with honor to themselves and advantage to their country.
Would any person expect to arrive at eminence as a sculptor if he were unacquainted
with the established preliminaries of his art, namely, drawing and anatomy? The
thing is soself-evident, that I am only surprised it has not longago been acted upon.
Upwards of twelve years have elapsed since I pointed out these facts to the profes-
sor of natural history in the University of Edinburgh, but things continue as they
were before that time.

Since Capt. Brown wrote these words, and very true ones they are,
another art and the accessories to it have enormously developed. I
_ refer to the art of photography. Now, if there be one thing more use-
ful to the scientific taxidermie artist than another it is a full practical
knowledge of the use of the photographic camera and all that directly
pertains thereto. Its application is most varied, and is greatly en-
hanced by the use of the time and instantaneous shutters. By the use
of the camera the taxidermist can secure subjects that the unaided eye
and pencilcan never give him, and these are all kinds of animals in rapid
motion, and they may be obtained, after a due amount of practice, by
the use of the photographic camera. One has but to study the superb
series of photographs obtained through the indefatigable Eadwuard
Muybridge to appreciate ny meaning here. No taxidermist who has
any regard for an attainment of excellence in his calling should neglect
to make good photographs of all the living animals that he can, and that
upon every possible opportunity. This should not be confined to wild
animals alone, but to all the domestic ones in their most common atti-
tudes.

Horses, cows, dogs, cats, pigs, and all the barnyard fowls should by
no means be beneath his notice. They should also be taken from many
points of view, I might say from every possible point of view, and then
be nearer what the taxidermist really needs in his work. He should
carefully keep a series of large-sized and suitable scrapbooks wherein
all his photographs should be carefully inserted, together with his
sketches, and everything of the kind, with their full histories and notes,
384 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

ete., recorded upon opposite pages. Photographs should be made also
of plants of all kinds directly in the places where they occur in nature;
also the resorts of animals of every description; birds’ nests; and, in
short, every possible natural subject and creature and locality that the
taxidermist may be called upon to reproduce in his workshop. He
should also make photographs of dissections, the skeletons of animals,
models, and designs, and of dead animals. Ever should it be promi-
nently before his mind that one of the greatest of all taxidermiecal de-
siderata is the obtaining of good models of all kinds and deseriptions,
and models true to nature in every sense of the word. Frequently
artists who are correct observers and portrayers of animals make fine
illustrations of them, either in the form of colored or uncolored prints,
and these the taxidermist should secure for his ‘‘note book” when-
ever he possibly can.
On this point Mr. Staebner has very truly remarked :*

It would seem almost superfluous to insist on the value, nay the absolute neces-
sity, of good illustrations as aids to the taxidernists, were it not that the impor-
tance of the subject appears to be hardly yet fully appreciated by many of the very
ones to be most benefited.

There was a time, now happily past, as the work exhibited by this association
abundantly proves, when individuals who mounted birds and animils (as their cards
set forth) were content to ram a hide full of packing material, sew it up, and call
the effigy by this or that name, according as this or that animal was desired. The
degree of monstrosity, if if may be so termed, thus produced, was in inverse ratio
to the care of the workman for his art and his knowledge (often scant enough) of
the external appearance of the animal he was attempting to reproduce. These mon-
strosities of taxidermy are still to be seen in many of our public museums, where, let
us hope, they at least serve the purpose of teaching the younger generation, how not
to do it.

As in all other departments of human activity, so in this is the skilled workman
plainly superseding the unskilled, and the class of work thus becoming more and
more a source of pride and satisfaction. The man with a love for his art, necessa-
rily something of a naturalist and with a naturalist’s care, anxious about the correct-
ness of all the details of his work, must utilize all the aids at his command, and of
these aids accurate drawings and paintings occupy the chief place. These are the
taxidermist’s works of reference to which he goes for information precisely as an-
other goes to his encyclopedia, since the ability is given to no man to carry all the
minute points of an animal’s external appearance in his mind. That the representa-
tions for this purpose should be what are strictly understeod as works of art is obvi-
ously unnecessary. :

The objects to be secured, however, and which they should possess to meet the
requirements of the case are: (1) accuracy of outline; (2) truthfulness of attitude,
and (3) in order of importance, correctness of coloring, and in so far as they conform
to these things are they already, by just so much, works of art. What is technically
known as artistic effect should here be a secondary consideration. Having secured
the first three essential points, attention may be given to the lasts

In the case of rare animals such representations as is well known are the sole reli-
ance of the taxidermist. That they have a value even in the case of more familiar
animals may be instanced by the case of the walrus. The pictures of this mammal

SCIENTIFIC TAXIDERMY FOR MUSEUMS. 385

in all the professed works on zoélogy and natural history, even in so good and gen-
erally correct a work as Brehm, are glaringly false, and it is only within the last
few years that anything approaching truthful representations—figures drawn from
observation instead of copies of previous drawings originally evolved from the artist’s
“inner consciousness ”—have been given us, and so it happens that of mounted speci-
mens of the walrus showing the true appearance of the animal almost the only ones
at the present time are the one at Cambridge, and that other at the United States
National Museum mounted by Mr. Hornaday. *

How often has a painstaking taxidermist wished for a means of refreshing his rec-
ollection on some little matter of detail concerning a creature’s anatomy, and been
obliged to finally guess atit because of the lack of adequate iliustrations. Let me
not be understood as descrying the assistance afforded by zéological gardens. It is
just here that they come into play, and as it is better for the taxidermist to observe
at first hand, so these are even better than drawings for reference; but the fact is
they are far from being readily accessible at best in this country, and in the few
instances in which this objection does not apply the variety of specimens which
they contain is too limited, so that we are still compelled to supplement them by a
more ready source of information, and thus we fall back upon pictorial representa-
tions as on the whole most convenient. As above implied, however, these represen-
tations must be taken from life by skillful hands, and must give us the animals as
they look, and not as the artist thinks they ought to look.

But in order that we may have such we must encourage those who work in this
line—the Landseers, the Baryes, the Wolfs, the Spechts, ete., whom, under a change
of name, we have in this country in the Beards, the Kemeyses, etc. We must make
it profitable for them to undertake the work we so much need, and if we have the
good of taxidermy at heart, if we have faith in its capabilities as an art we will do
this, for in so doing we are helping it and ourselves as well as them.

In The Auk for April, 1891, the present writer published a letter en-
titled ‘Camera notes for ornithologists,” which, not being of very
great length and quite in line with the views just quoted above, will,
I think, bear repeating here, and enlarging upon a little further along.
I said:

At the last congress of the American Ornithologists’ Union there were exhibited
many photographs of all sorts of ornithological subjects, and the majority of them
were examined by the writer with great care.

For one, I was disappointed in the results arrived at by the authors of the most
of them, as there appeared to be such a total absence of any practical result attained.
Among the best that I saw were some taken by Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, but even those,
the work of a most painstaking naturalist, did not come up to what the camera is
capable of performing for practical ornithology. Little or nothing is to be gained
in this latter direction by photographing bunches of game or badly mounted speci-
mens and similar subjects. Any tyro can accomplish as much as that, and orni-
thology not be called upon to thank him for it.

In the present communication it is the writer’s object to relate some personal
experiences which may be of assistance to those interested in this line of work.

Now, in the first place, as to some of the objects to be attained: There are a num-
ber of these. We may desire, for example, a sharp, clear photograph, which either
may be natural size or may present the subject reduced, for the use of the lithog-
rapher, in order to place in the latter’s hands an accurate figure to be copied on to
stone, and the plates printed therefrom to be used for illustrative purposes. The

subject may be a bird, its young, or its nest, or a dissection of a bird, or its skele-
ton, or its eggs, and so on indefinitely. Owls present to many artists difficult sub-
jects to draw satisfactorily, but there is no reason why we should not, by the aid of
the camera and a 5-by-8 plate, for a small sum, and in very short order, have ready
for the lithographer a life-size figure, and a perfectly accurate one, of such a species
as Nyctala acadica, or upon a similar plate a handsomely reduced figure of Bubo vir-
ginianus. Again, by varying our material, colored figures are easily obtained for
like purposes. Photographs of this character may also be used to make wood cuts
from, or they may be reproduced by some of the various styles of ‘‘ process work.”
Yet another object: We may desire to produce by the aid of a camera an accurate
figure of any of the above-mentioned subjects from which an electrotype can be
directly made. This also is now easy of accomplishment, and such illustrations
meet a vast variety of needs in descriptive ornithology. These, then, are some of
the principal objects to be attained, viz, clear, accurate figures, either life size or
reduced to any desired size, and either plain or colored, which (by the use of ditter-
ent materials) can be used at once by either the lithographer, the wood engraver,
the ‘‘ process worker,” or the electrotyper.

Your material must be the best in all particulars. Luse a large, first-class, quick-
working lens; a Blair’s camera for the 5 by 8 plate; the iron and oxalate developer,
using the chemically pure material (filtered); bichloride of mercury and ammonia
for intensifying, etc.

Our method of procedure can best be illustrated by a few examples. Say we wish
to reproduce, life size, a hawk’s egg. Suspend on the wall opposite and under the
strong sunlight, a smooth, half-inch pine board; cover this with white blotting
paper, held on with some half dozen artists’ thumb tacks. Of course your egg is to
be blown and not show the opening. Next you decide whether or no you desire it
to throw a shadow; if you do, you simply fasten it to the blotting paper with a
small piece of soft wax, exposing to the camera the side you wish represented; if you
do not, you insert a piece of wire afew inches long into the board and perpendicular
to it, and fasten the egg to the end of it with a soft piece of wax. Place a bucket
of water on the floor under the egg, in case the specimen should accidentally drop
oft. Focus the egg natural size and sharp on the ground glass of your camera; this
may be ascertained by a pair of calipers, comparing the actual length of the egg
with its image upon the ground glass. Insert your smallest diaphragm and expose,
the time of exposure being governed by your former experiences. I prefer Seed’s
dry plates. They give excellent results. After developing, unless you get a very
strong negative it is always best to intensify your plate, and this is done by the
usual mereury and ammonia process. Now, if you wish an uncolored figure to be
lithographed, or woodcut, or for some of the special processes, you must print on the
best ready sensitized albumen paper, toning the print handsomely afterwards. On
the other hand, if you desire a colored figure, you must print on plain, 7. e., non-
albumenized, sensitized paper, and afterwards color the print by hand with New-
ton’s water-colors from the specimen. Pure white eggs stand out well when pho-
tographed against black velvet or crape; this also applies to some skulls and other
osteological specimens, when they are cleaned to a state of glistening whiteness.

Such a procedure defines the outlines well for the engraver.

When we come to the photographing of birds, living birds, for the purpose of
obtaining the proper kind of figures that can be used for the various methods of
reproduction now in vogue, we enter upon a field where one can display no end of
patience, tact, and ingenuity. It will be along day before the writer will forget
his experience in obtaining a photograph of a live screech owl. Three times I
walked half a mile from the house where I could get a sky background for him on
the summit of a hill, where an old natural stump was also to be found to serve as a
perch for him. Justas good a result can be obtained by photographing your bird”
in your studio with a sheet for a background, and then you may choose any kind of
SCIENTIFIC TAXIDERMY FOR MUSEUMS. 387

perch you desire, from a museum T to the limb of a rugged old pine with the cones
anc spines on,

Right here, however, I desire to mention a process, no doubt already known to
many, for which there is no end of use. Say you have obtained a fine, intensified
negative, the subject being a bird caught in the act of some habit peculiar toit, You
wish to obtain a good, strong, accurate outline figure of it, from which an electro-
type can at once be made, to serve as an illustration for some article upon which you
may beengaged, Make a print from the plate upon plain, nonalbumuinized, sensi-
tized paper. Remove the print to the dark-room and wash out the silver from it
thoroughly. You may tone, but it is not absolutely necessary unless there is very
considerable detail im your figure. Dry the print in the dark, and keep in a
perfectly dark place until evening. When evening comes complete your work
under a good lamp where the direct rays do not fall upon your print. Pin this lat-
ter out on a small drawing-board with artists’ thumb tacks, and then with a map-
ping-pen (No, 291, Gillott’s) and Higgins’ American drawing ink carefully ink over
by lines and otherwise the outlines of your figure. In doing this you will have the
opportunity of making it appear justas you desire your outline ink sketch to appear
when it comes to be finally printed from the electrotype. Having carefully com-
pleted your work, immerse the print flat in a tray containing a saturated solution of
bichloride of mercury. This in a moment takes out all of the print except the ink
outline you have traced, and this latter it leaves upon a pure white sheet of paper.
Next dry the print thoroughly and mount upon a suitable card. At a small cost, a
good electrotype can be made from this figure. Photographing against a sheet, of
course, takes out a great deal that you do not want in your reproduced figure, but
by the process just described you need not have a single point or line more than you
want. It works admirably where we wish to reduce the subject to any required
size; in osteological subjects and in dissections; in deformities of birds; and indeed
in dozens of other cases. To naturalists in general I would say that the process just
described is absolutely invaluable; by its means ready and accurate sketches are
made of characters of country; of all sorts of ethnological subjects, as pottery and
native arts, sometimes so difficult to draw; of complicated skeletons; of living ani-
mals of all kinds, and thousands of other subjects too numerous for enumeration.

With some live birds the following plan will be found to work well: Suspend a
shelf, at the proper height, from the wall of your studio and in the proper light.
This shelf, as usual, is to be entirely covered with white blotting paper, and upon
its horizontal part is to be firmly fixed the limb, trunk, or rock, or turf upon which
you desire your specimen to appear. Set up your camera and focus this perch
sharply on your ground-glass; next putin your smaliest diaphragm and attach your
‘pneumatic shutter” ready for instant use. Gently take your living bird in your
hand, smooth its feathers, caress it for a moment or two, then quietly place its head
under its wing, and by beginning slowly soon rapidly whirl your specimen in a cir-
cle. ‘This, as it were, ‘‘putit asleep,” butit will seize the perch with its feet, or rest
quietly on rock or turf. Place it as near as possible in the position you desire, and
stand ready for a semi-instantaneous picture. Be perfectly quiet. Inafew moments
your bird gradually comes to, rights himself, preens up a little, looks around, steadies
himself into a natural attitude, finally looks himself, and then more or less animated.
This is your chance, puff the snap on him!

Upon reading this over I find few, if any, alterations to make, and
since 1t was written I have succeeded in obtaining not a few good tig-
ures according to its directions, some of which are republished as illus-
trations in the present paper and will be described a little later.
There 1s one thing, however, that needs notice, and in order to get a
good electrotype or stereotype, it is not necessary to proceed as above
388 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

given, for we can simply make a blue print; that, as we know, ean be
done in a few moments, and is a finished picture, 7. ¢., does not require
toning and fixing. Then trace what you desire to appear on your blue
print as directed, and bleach out with a saturated solution of bicarbo
nate of potash. This gives you a black and white drawing of any finish,
according to the labor you may desire to put upon it, and is the working
drawing now so commonly used for newspaper cuts; but when printed
upon the best paper, for the resulting electrotype or stereotype fur-
nishes an excellent drawing for a variety of purposes, and a very useful
one for the working naturalist and practical taxidermist.

Blotting paper in large sheets makes a far better background than
a Sheet, and you may use it pure white, or blue, or gray, according to
the effect you desire to produce. Your subject should be well in front
of the background, and, if possible, so far in front as to avoid a shadow
being thrown upon it. Pictures thus taken out of doors, on clear, bright
days, are generally excellent.

Returning now to the requirements of the skilled taxidermist, I have
said, and Capt. Brown supports me in it, he should have such a knowl
edge of physics and chemistry as will assist him in the case of the first
in deciding upon the possible and impossible in the matter of the atti.
tudes of animals, and to some extent in the surroundings, as 1m the
rock work, ete., now extensively used in reproducing large groups,
With respect to chemistry he should be so much master of its general
principles as to be enabled to practically apply it to the action ana
composition of preservatives for the preservation of every description
of animal tissue. Not only that, but such a knowledge will be useful
to him in experimenting with the preservation of many kinds of plant
growths and kindred structures. For instance, I have recently been
shown specimens of the leaves of some varieties of trees that had been
gathered in nature and so perfectly restored that there was no very
ereat depreciation in them, either of form or color, and the effect when ~
properly done is most excellent.

Fruits are now frequently reproduced by the methods of the plastic
cast, and are so perfect as to absolutely deceive the most critical of
observers. The persimmons in the Raccoon Group in the National
Museum were manufactured in that way, and it is by no means an easy
task, aided by the eye alone, to distinguish them from the originals.

This brings us to the question of the various modes of modeling, and
here is one of the branches of the taxidermic art, upon which too great
an amount of skill and ingenuity can not well be expended. Here all
the acquirements of the art student in taxidermy can be applied and
nothing lost by the labor. It involves the application of all his knowl-
edge of anatomy, his technique, his taste, and indeed, nearly everything
which it has been recommended above for him to prepare himself in.
He should be able to make easts of both vertebrates and invertebrates
in plaster-of- Paris; he should be familiar with the various methods now

so generally in use, of the reproduction of many of the smaller animals
in the different.kinds of plastic material; he should be an adept in the
use of clays, wax, wood, and other materials for the restoration of
parts. In short, now that taxidermy is a rapidly progressing art, the
advanced students and representatives of it, require, I think, no word
from me here to stimulate them to keep abreast of the many improve-
ments taking place in it. Among other things it should be the aim of
taxidermists to establish in this country at least several good soci-
eties, where from time to time they could meet and exhibit the most
recent successes in their art. Where papers could be read, and the
work of individuals generally compared. Organization, in other words,
I must believe, would at the present stage of the art’s development, be
a benefit.

The writer of this paper has ever been a strong advocate of the
establishment of large, thoroughly equipped Government institutions
of learning or universities, and of the nation’s duty to educate in the
best possible manner her aspirants in the dinerent departments of
science and art. What a national safeguard it would be in such a
profession, for example, as medicine; what a source of stimulation to
such an art as taxidermy? I weigh my words well, when I say that if
such an institution could annually graduate in this country 50 thor-
oughly educated and skilled taxidermists, it would in time, far more
heavily redound to our national credit than much else I could name
which our Government indulges in. Apply it to all the arts and
sciences, and we would command the respect of every nation of the
globe, and, better than this, it would be that kind of respect which
skill, knowledge, and culture always brings, and which brilliant dis-
play of warships. guns and warism can never inspire.

Let us pass next to the consideration of the question of some of the
results now attained to by modern taxidermists mm the preserving of
animals for museum exhibition. Here we meet with at the very out-
start, a phase of the art in which the workers at the U.S. National
Museum have kept themselves fully abreast with the advances made
jn it. Recently some beautiful work has been turned out here, espe-
cially in the line of single specimens, as well as groups, of marine in-
vertebrates for the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago.

Take, for example, such an elegant reproduction of an Octopus as is
shown in Plate xv (0. vulgaris). This triumph in the matter of an exact
model. perfectly preserved, of a large soft invertebrate animal is ae-
complished through the use of the plaster mold, and gelatine cast,
now so successfully brought to such perfection. Under the careful
supervision of Mr. F. A, Lucas, whom I must thank here for the selec-
tion of the six specimens illustrating this department, the proper speci-
mens are first picked out from the collection or are chosen from plates,
and pass next in order to the most skilled modellers, casters, and color-
ers. Of the series I here present, Mr. A. H. Baldwin has made the
%,

models after the drawings of various artists which will be hereinafter
mentioned. After a model has been made, a mold is next taken, and
from it a gelatine cast is secured which later is finally trimmed to life,
and faithfully colored to nature. Mr. J. W. Scollick is responsible for
the delicate manipulation required in securing accurate molds and
castings from the models, and then they once more pass to Mr. Bald-
win’s hands to be colored. After this operation and when perfectly dry,
they may either be tastefully mounted upon properly tinted pieces of
small boards of a suitable kind of wood, dressed down to a right thick-
ness, or they may play their part in a group, wherein all the natural
surroundings of such creatures are reproduced, save the element in
which they exist. This specimen of Octopus vulgaris was based on the
figure given by Verany, as was also the models of Sepia officinalis,
shown in Plate xvi and in one of Histioteuthis bonelliana, shown in
Plate xvil, and so may be relied upon as being more or less true to
nature.

Unless one has seen one of these finished gelatine casts of such an
animal as an Octopus, it is hard to realize what a perfect represen-
tation it gives us of the living animal; and, the cast being perfectly
pliable, much as is the best of good rubber, it still further enhances
the resemblance to the original. But to produce this, requires skill
and art of a very high order at nearly every step of the process. In
the first place, if we are to model from a drawing, that drawing must
be known to be accurate; if we model from a specimen, we must be ~
sure about placing it in a posture that the animal is known to habitu-
ally assume. Great skill is next required in making a perfect model
or copy of the design or specimen, and then it goes without saying
thatit isonly through long experience and care thatthe necessary molds
and casts are obtained. Much depends at last upon the ability of the
artist to faithfully color the result of all the previous efforts; that is,
the trimmed cast. Hornaday has said in his work on Taxidermy:

For irregular objects, the working of a gelatine mold is perfection itself. It
yields gracefully in coming out of the undercuts and around corners, takes every
detail perfectly, and in the jacket its shape is always the same. A careful operator
can make from twenty to fifty copies of a cast in a single mold before its loss of
sharpness necessitates its abandonment (p. 267).

Hornaday’s brief chapter on the making of molds and casts in the
volume just quoted is one of the most useful and valuable in the book.

In passing, | am tempted to say here that the Cuttlefishes to which
this Octopus belongs are the most highly organized members of the class
of animals constituting the Cephalopoda. — As the Malakia, they were
fully recognized by Aristotle over three hundred years before Christ. Of
their distribution, Nicholson has said that—

They are all marine, active, rapacious, and carnivorous in their habits, swimming
vigorously by means of the jets of water emitted from the funnel, or in an opposite di-
rection by means of fins, and creeping about the sea bottom by means of the prehensile
arms. Some forms (suchas the Octopodidwand Sepia) are essentially littoral animals,
"a

SCIENTIFIC TAXIDERMY FOR MUSEUMS. 391

frequenting shallow seas, living in the vicinity of the land, and specially affecting
rocky bottoms. Others (such as Tremoctopus, Sepiola, Argonauta, Spirula, Architeu-
this, Onychoteuthis, etc.) are pelagic animals, living in the open ocean, often far
from land, and swimming at or near the surface. Though more varied as regards
their specific and generic types in the warmer seas of the globe, cuttlefishes are
found in almost all seas, and are sometimes extremely numerous individually even
in the colder oceans. It seems also certain that our present knowledge as to the
pelagic forms is only very imperfect. As to their dimensions, none are extremely
minute, and some attain truly gigantic dimensions. Not to speak of the fabulous
accounts of colossal cuttlefishes given by many of the older writers, such as Pon-
toppidan and Olaus Magnus, we are now acquainted through the observations and
descriptions of scientific witnesses, such as Banks and Solander, Quoy, and Gaim-
ard, Steenstrup, Verrill, ete., with various huge cuttlefishes, inhabiting both the
Atlantie and Pacific oceans. Some of these, though only known by imperfect spec-
imens, certainly attain a length of 15 feet or upwards to the body and head, and
from 30 to 40 feet or upwards in the iong tentacles. All these giant cuttletishes
appear to belong to the suborder of the Decapoda.*

These gelatine casts are not only accurate and beautiful objects to
be placed in the cases of any museum, but they, by being kept under
the protection of glass doors, will last for almost an indefinite length
of time, unaltered in color or form. The range of the applicability of
the gelatine cast is well-nigh infinite. I have seen fish, frogs, ser-
pents, lizards, and similar animals thus reproduced, and so perfectly
that their faithful portrayal of the original subjects was truly marvelous.
As to fruit of all kinds, it can be imitated so closely that sometimes,
by the aid of the eye alone, one can not correctly decide between the
original and the copy thus made.

For the presentation of form, color, and general character, such
reproductions of animals as the common Squid, shown in Plate xvi, and
the Histioteuthis, shown in Fig. 4, leaves but little to be desired along
such lines. No one can fora moment doubt but what a great deal is to
be hoped for from this department of animal preservation, and the en-
couragement of it is to be most highly recommended.

Other fine successes in this direction are shown in Plate xviu, Fig. 1,
Plate xvitl, Fig. 2, and Plate x1x. Plate xvii, Fig. 1, of a specimen of
Polynoé leucohyba (somewhat enlarged), and likewise the Gastrolepidia
clavigera, Shown in Plate xvii, Fig. 2 (somewhat enlarged), are from
Schmarda, both being very instructive representations of the originals.
As is known, these low forms belong to the Annelida, each being genera
in the order Polychaeta of that group.

Another beautiful reproduction of an interesting annelid is shown in
Plate x1x. This is also from a photograph of the gelatine cast in the
collections of the U.S. National Museum and represents a specimen of
Bonellia viridis of the Mediterranean Sea. It is greatly enlarged, and
the model based upon the drawing given us of this form by Lacaze-
Duthiers, who has rendered an account of this marine worm in a paper

“Nicholson, H.A. Art. “Cuttlefish.” Eneyl. Brit. 9th ed. vol. v1., pp. 739, 740.
302 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

entitled “Recherches sur La Bonella (Bonellia viridis).”. (Ann. Scien.
Nat., tom. x, Paris, 1858, pp. 49-110, Pls. 1-4.)

Such annelida as Bonellia represents belong to the order Gephyrea,
and, according to W.C. McIntosh, “seem to approach the Echino-
derms through the Holothuroidea.” They are all marine types, being
very widely distributed throughout nature, specially in muddy regions,
some being frequently found in univalve shells.

By such representatious as these, and by the judicious use of ex-
planatory tables, surely ie museum of the. future has a fine field to
look forward to, for such an artas this is capable of classifying in cases,
according to natural taxonomical schemes, whole groups of animals,
that heretofore have been studies only from the specimens and from
plates and drawings. It also admits of similar casts, duly colored, of
the anatomical structure of these little popularly known types, and, as
I have already said above, of placing many of them in their cases sur-
rounded by reproductions of the objects of their several environments
in nature.

Passing next to the art of taxidermy as applied to crustaceans we
are confronted with an entirely different problem than the one of which
we have just been speaking. And, as the writer has had no personal
experience of the kind, it is with no little pleasure that I find a brief
but able article on this subject by my friend Mr. F. A. Lucas, and from
it I here quote such parts as are in keeping with the present paper, by
which I mean that the outstanding difficulties will be indicated while
the technique of the art will be omitted.

Lucas has said:

Mounting of crabs, lobsters, and other crustaceans is somewhat of a thankless task,
requiring an outlay of considerable time and trouble to arrive at results at all satis-
factory. At first sight it would seem an easy matter tomount an animal whose form
is determined beforehand, but a little trial develops the fact that, like bringing up
children, it is much easier in theory than in practice. As crustaceans dry they be-
come very brittle, and the small legs and delicate feelers break only too readily.
Worse than all, the beautiful colors with which these creatures are adorned while
living fade rapidly, and the only way in which they can be renewed is by a dex-
trous use of paint. Therefore the great requisites for mounting crustaceans are a
careful touch, a good eye for colors, and some knowledge of the proper methuds of
applying them. The preparation of crustaceans is a little peculiar, inasmuch as, in-
stead of the skin being removed from the body, the body is removed piecemeal from
the skin. .

Crustaceans may be mounted either on plain pedestals or on artificial
rock work, according to the purpose they are to serve, and in any case they should be
kept out of the dust as far as possible, since, owing to their fragile nature, they are
very difficult to clean.*

“On the Mounting of Crustaceans. Third Annual Report of the Society of Ameri-
can Taxidermists, pp. 74-77, 1882-’83. As it is a fact quite as well known to every
one interested in the matter as it is unfortunate, that The Society of American Taxi- -
dermists no longer has any existence, I will here make a bibliographical note of
the two former reports of that society for the benetit of those who may desire to con-

SCIENTIFIC TAXIDERMY FOR MUSEUMS. a0

In time we must believe that the plastic method as described above for
invertebrates will come to be generally used for crustaceans as well.
There is no reason that I can at present see that it should not, and every
reason that it should. No specimens of the group preserved in that
way have come to my attention in the collections of the National
Museum or elsewhere, and so I have no plates of the same to offer here.
Those prepared by the methods recommended by Mr. Lucas are so well
done, and differ so little or not at all from those animals as they are
recognized by us in nature, that nothing would be gained by reproduc-
ing photographs of them as illustrations to the present report; there-
fore the idea was not entertained.

This fact has also influenced in regard to insects; moreover, in the
case with that group our Government has already published very full
instructions upon their mounting and preservation for museum pur-
poses, and that taxidermist who aspires to be a master of every depart-
ment of his art can do no better than consult the admirable treatises of
Prof. C. V. Riley, and of Prof. A. 8S. Packard, and others in the same
field.

When we come to fishes, however, we at once enter upon the bor-
derland of the taxidermy of the great realm of the vertebrata, and for
it there exists a not inextensive literature, and methods and instrue-
tions are found almost without end.

Fishes seem to have constituted the béte noir of the museum collee-
tor and the taxidermist for ages past, and until the use of the gelatine
cast came into vogue their natural preservation seemed almost hopeless.
In alcohol many of them become shrunken, and a large percentage part
with their natural colors entirely. Moreover, the usual cylindrical jars
used to exhibit them in, onthe museum shelves, so distort their forms
to the eye of the casual observer who thus views them through the
glass, that another serious disadvantage is added. To a large extent,
this has recently been overcome by Mr. J. E. Benedict, of the National
Museum, who, by indefatigable patience and thought, has devised very
neat appearing glass receptacles, with plane surface sides, and a few
ingenious devices for sustaining the contained specimens in more natu-
ral positions, thus largely doing away with the aforesaid disadvantage.

Still, where alcohol is the preservative used, there yet remain the loss
of color and the distortion due to shrinkage. Many authors in the art
of taxidermy have suggested in their works from time to time various
plans for the skinning of fishes, and ‘ stuffing” them much in the same
way that birds and mammals are done. But as arule, failure of greater
or less degree is generally the outcome of all such attempts. I have
studied collections of stuffed fishes in many parts of this country and
elsewhere, and I yet have to meet with one in any museum or private
collection, that comes up to what it ought to be. We turn from the
cases of such objects with feelings of anything but a pleasurable nature.
We hear a great deal said about the beauty of birds, and they are beau-
tiful, but I, for one, see a beauty that is quite equal to it in the vast
majority of fishes. Where has nature a lovelier object to offer for our
admiration than a finely marked adult speckled trout just as the fellow
is pulled out of his natural element and lies in the bright rays of the
sun, panting upon a grassy bank? And, do we ever see anything that
very much resembles his incomparable charms in our miserable dried-up
collections of ‘+ stuffed” fishes? Hornaday has said:

Certain it is that in nearly every large zoélogical museum the stuffed fishes are
the least attractive, and the least lifelike of all the vertebrates, In many instances
the reptiles are not far behind in unsightliness, although, as a ruie, they are a little
more lifelike than the fishes. In only one natural history museum cut of twenty-
seven have I found a collection of stuffed fishes which surpassed in number and
quality of specimens the collection of birds and mammals, and formed the most
attractive feature of the entire museum. That fish collection is to be seen in the
Government museum at Madras, India, and I have reason to believe it is at present
the finest of its kind in existence. The collection consists of a very general assort-
ment of specimens from the Indian Ocean, and particularly from the Coromandel
coast, and besides a large number of small specimens it also contains as many large
sharks, Rhinobatidw, and rays as the authorities have been able to obtain without
duplicating the species.

The specimens were all mounted while fresh from the ocean, which, of course, has

been a great advantage to the taxidermist. I was somewhat surprised to learn that
the taxidermist in question was an Indian native named P. Anthony Pillay, because
jast Indian natives of all classes are almost without exception very bad taxider-
mists. Upon being introduced to Mr. Pillay, an old Mohammedan gentleman with a
long white beard, dressed in the style of his class, he very obligingly explained to
me his method of mounting fish of all kinds. *

Personally, I have but little or no confidence in cultivating the art
along on these lines, notwithstanding the measure of success attained
to by the Indian taxidermist just mentioned. For all large zoélogical
museums I believe that experimentation should proceed in the direc-
tion of discovering, if possible, some clear, transparent, preservative
fluid that will not change the form or color of the specimens, and then
exhibiting them in such positions as we would see them in aquaria
and such tanks containing living fishes as are to be seen at the exhibi-

tion room, the grottos, of the U.S. Fish Commission at Washington,
D.C. Mr. Benedict, no doubt, has the correct idea in regard to the
form of the receptacles that should contain them, and that is a very
important step in advance. Added to this, the taxidermic artist has
a beautiful field open to him in his method of making plaster casts and
easts of gelatine, upon both of which he may exert his utmost powers
and ability to color so as to have them resemble the natural fish as
closely as possible, and I mean the natural fish immediately after he
has been removed from the water and wiped dry. The study of the
proper colors alone is in itself a vast subject, for they must not only
counterpart the natural shades of the specimens, but they must be
selected with the view to their permanency and general effect. Vari-
ous methods of gilding and silvering upon plaster-of-Paris, gelatine
casts, and papier-maché ones require careful research and considera-
tion, as by their use many admirable results are to be obtained.

As to the large cartilaginous fishes, as the ravs, sharks, and their
kin, we must believe that the processes just referred to are at present the
only ones known to us by which the living specimens can be reproduced
with any marked fidelity to nature and fit for a first-class museum.

By the old fashion “stuffing” method, it seems quite out of the ques-
tion, even for the most skilled taxidermists among us, to succeed in
thus preserving a shark’s skin, or that tissue in the troublesome ray.
They will not resist the effects of time. They shrink, become distorted,
and finally burst, and bring only failure and disrepute upon the art.
One may as well try and stuff asoap bubble, and fortunately there is
no necessity for either experiment.

In his usual vigorous style, the artist I have last quoted, remarks:

Rays are the meanest of all subjects that vex the soul of the taxidermist. Shun
them as you would the smallpox or the devil. Such abominable animated pancakes,
with razor edges that taper out to infinite nothingness, were never made to be
mounted by any process known to mortal man. To mount the skin of a vile ray,
and make it really perfect and lifelike, is to invite infinite shrinkage, rips, tears,
warps, defeat, and humiliation at the hands of your envious rivals. If you must
mount a ray, by all means get square with it at the start. Stuff his miserable old
skin with tow or straw, the more the better. Ram him, cram him, “full to the very
jaws,” like the famous rattlesnake skin that taxidermist Miles Standish stuffed
“with powder and bullets.” If you can burst him wide open from head to tail, by
all means do so, and you may call me your slave for the rest of my life. Make him
nice and round, like a balloon, and then no matter what he does afterward to mor-
tify and disgrace you, and to drag your fair standard in the dust, you will always
have the satisfaction of knowing you are square with him.

Once when I was young and innocent, I encountered an enormous ray. He was
not thrust upon me, for I achieved him—and my own ruin also—at one fell stroke.
I mounted him willingly, nay, eagerly, as Phaeton mounted his chariot, to show the
rest of the world how all rays should be done. I mounted his vast, expansive skin
over a clay-covered manikin that had edges like a Damascus razor, and I made him
flat. He was flat enough to navigate the Platte River at low water, which even a
thick shingle can not do. He was lifelike and likewise was a great triumph. But
almost the moment my back was turned upon him forever, he went back upon me.
396 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 18992.

Thad put him up to stay put, so far as my part was concerned, so he just got mad
and literally tore himself to tatters. He became almost a total wreck, and to make
my defeat a more genuine and unmitigated crusher, Prof. Ward sent word tome,
all the way from Washington, that he would sell me that large ray for $5. I never
forgave him for that.

The best way to mount a ray is to make a nice plaster cast of it, paint it, and then
bury the accursed ray in a compost heap. As a class these fishes are remarkable, and
highly interesting, and there is a far greater variety of them than anyone who is not
an ichthyologist might suppose. ‘To me there is no other group of fishes moreinter-

esting, and, I may add, there is no other group that is, as a general thing, so poorly
represented in museum collections. They exhibit all possible intermediate forms
between the ordinary shark and the perfectly round, flat ray. The intermediate
forms, Rhinobatii and Rhamphobatis, are naturally really the most interesting. *

Some very fine plaster-of-Paris casts of fishes of all kinds are to be
found in the collections of the U. S. National Museum, but as has just
been remarked, for some reason or other the rays are but meagerly rep-
resented. These fishes, however, cast beautifully in plaster, and their
colors are not difficult to imitate. It would be hard, for example, to
find a more fitting specimen for museum exhibition than the plaster
cast of the skate shown in Plate xx of the present paper. The plastic
method also reproduces them with even greater fidelity, and it has the
advantage of not being near so easily injured orbroken. So perfect are
these two methods that I will warrant that were we to take the living
skate, the gelatine and plaster casts, make photographs of them all of
the same seale and under the same conditions as the one seen in ny
plate, we could only with the greatest difficulty distinguish among
them.

Not only is it possible to reproduce life-like representations of living
fishes by means of the plaster-of- Paris cast, but to a certain degree we
can also, by the same means, show some of the habits of this interest-
ing group of vertebrates. A fine examople of this is seen in Plate xx1 of
this report, wherein we are presented with a most excellent cast of a
shark (Carcharhinus obscurus) to whose left side has attached itself a

temora (Hcheneis naucrates), a habit this parasitic fish is habitually
addicted to, as is well-known. This fine piece of work, done by Mr.
Joseph Palmer, of the museum, has been colored very closely to imitate
life, and is not only a most interesting and instructive object to have on
exhibition in any zoédlogical museum, but leaves but little to be desired
in the matter of conveying a correct idea of the form and general appear-
ance of these fishes, and in a method at once practical and, with care,
enduring. The mode of mounting such specimens is also seen in the
figures in the plates, and it probably can not very well be improved
upon, consisting as it does of two strong metal upright standards of
the proper length, and which are embedded below in the horizontal
base or stand of wood. This latter may be either plain pine, painted
black and heavily varnished, or it may be of any of the dark, hard

woods highly polished. In any event the aim should be to have it all of
a pattern and kind throughout the museum for subjects of one class, as
these fishes. It admits placing the label adopted by the museum in
front and in the ceuter below, which may be attached in various ways,
or simply fastened to an obliquely cut block of wood, finished in the same
style as the base, and left to rest free upon it. It is important that the
base should be as long, or nearly as long, as the specimen it supports,
for that net only lends an appearance of good balance and symmetry
to the whole, but it also is a great safeguard against the cast being
accidentally tipped over and broken, or broken by the specimen pro-
jecting out beyond it too far, and so not properly protecting it.

The Remora shown in Plate XXI is at once recognized by the black
stripes down its side and the white corners to the caudal fin. It seems
to attach itself principally to the sharks, thus differing with its congener
of the ocean (Remora squalipeta) so frequently found adhering to the
sides and bottoms of ships at sea, well below their water line.

Another fine cast of a shark (Ginglymostoma cirratum) also in plaster,
is seen in- Plate xx1, and viewed upon superior aspect. This not only
gives an absolutely correct idea of the animal it was taken from, but
shows very well the peculiar lateral corrugations of the skin, so charae-
teristic of this and other species.

Of the Teleosteans [I am enabled to present in my plates quite a num-
ber of interesting and well-known forms, and if the methods of casting
in plaster-of-Paris and plastic compounds be so successful in the case
of the cartilaginous fishes, it requires nothing to be said that it is equally
applicable to them.

All of the casts of the specimens here offered are from the collections
of the National Museum, and the perfect manner in which they are
done is well exemplified in the specimen of the turbot shown in Plate
XXIII (Rhombus maximus). Most, if not all of them, were executed by
Mr. Joseph Palmer with the assistance of his son, Mr. William Palmer,
under the supervision and direction of some ichthyologist of the muse-
um’s staff, and skillfully colored by Mr. A. Z. Shindler. Among the
principal points to be looked to in making such casts is (1) the selee-
tion of as perfect specimens as possible, especially in the matter of
unmutilated parts, as fins and tail, and structures of the head; (2)
the parts should be exhibited in a natural manner or properly spread
out; (3) the cast so made as to exhibit special characers; it should be
colored true to nature in a way already indicated; and, (5) finally,
they should be well mounted, labeled, and exhibited in a closed glass
case.

Later on we shall see that fish do not require in these matters quite
as much knowledge, care, and study asdo the reptiles; still they require
a good deal, and it should invariably be bestowed upon them.

More or less uniformly colored, and comparatively smooth fishes,
show up fully as well as those with many salient characters, and this
398 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

is well seen in such an example as the common Pompano ( 7rachynotus
carolinus) of Plate Xxrv, Fig. 2, which gives a most complete idea of this
interesting species. In most of these specimens the ventral fins, it will be
seen, have, before casting, been brought up so as to be in contaet with
the body of the fish. This is done with the view of giving them the
support of the latter and thus greatly decreasing the danger of having
them broken off either through subsequent handling of the cast or
otherwise.

Plaster casts of fishes also admit, in some cases only, of having the
proper kinds of glass eyes inserted in them after the cast is made; or
some special structures added, as the barbels of certain species, or
spines of great delicacy, or hair-like appendages—these structures
being composed of some other material than plaster, and being painted
and made to naturally harmonize with the specimen as in life. This is
rarely, if ever, necessary in the case of those fishes cast in gelatine or
similar plastic compounds. This feature of the work admits of no lit-
tle skill and knowledge on the part of the caster and painter of these
vertebrates. Nothing should in any event be omitted that will lend a
true and life-like appearance of the original specimen, and very encour-
aging progress is being made along such lines.

Another excellent plaster cast of a fish is seen in Plate xxv,taken from
a specimen of the Mirror carp (Cyprinus carpio), a fish with an inter.
esting history in this country now,and which, among other characters,
is at once recognized by having “extraordinarily large scales which run
along the sides of the body in three or four rows, the rest of the body
being bare.”

A fine east is also shown in Plate xxv, fig. 2, it being the Buffalo fish
(Itiobus urus).

It is needless almost to invite attention here once more to the fact
of how well these casts here represent the forms as they appear in life.
The red fish or bass of. the Southern States (Scia@na ocellata) has also
been cast, and a fine example of it exists in the collections of the
Museum. Where a fish has strong and pronounced external charac-
ters, such as large scales, large projecting rays to the tail or fins, and
marked characters of mouth or operculum, they are sure to constitute
one of the most favorable varieties of fish to cast in plaster, and they,
when skillfully painted, make some of the most striking specimens among
a collection of such objects. This may be appreciated by an examina.
tion of the cast of the Parrot fish (Scarus sp.?), Shown in Plate XXIv, or
to nearly an equal extent in the one of the Trigger fish (Balistes capri-
sens), a specimen of which is to be found in the Museum’s collections;
and as for the reproduction of color markings, we see a good example
in the cast of the well-known Mud fish (Amia calva), to which Plate
XxVI, Fig. 2, of this paper is devoted.

We have already alluded to the use of the plastic method of casting
for fishes, and so far as my personal investigations have been directed

they have been concerned principally with the work of that nature done
by the U.S. Fish Commission, much of which was accomplished with
the view of having it exhibited at the World’s Columbian Exposition.
In this connection my thanks are due Dr. Tarleton H. Bean for the use
of a series of photographs of the results of such methods and other
processes. These, unfortunately, with the single exception of the Opah,
were taken too small to be used here, and as the originals had been for-
warded to Chicago, it was too late to have them photographed of a
larger size. My thanks are also due to Mr. Denton for his kindness in
showing me his method of reproducing specimens of fish and reptiles by
the plastic method from casts made in plaster, and for submitting to
me for examination specimens of his work after they had been painted
and prepared for final exhibition. It would be difficult to overestimate
the value of this kind of work, and the field is a broad one, full of
importance and interest to the art student in taxidermy.

Specimens of many species of fish made according to such processes
bear very close resemblance to the living types, so much so that pho-
tographs of the two are scarcely to be distinguished. This may best
be appreciated by an examination of the specimen in the U.S. Fish
Commission, or the reduced photograph which that institution has of
the plastic cast of the Opah, from a specimen taken upon our own
coasts. Its peculiar form and high coloring rendered it a specially fine
subject for the skill of the person who reproduced it. Ichthyologists
have always expressed great interest in this member of the finny king-
dom, and if the digression be not considered too great, I will quote
here what Mr. Goode has said of it in The Fishery Industries of the
United States (p. 335). According to this distinguished authority, the
Opah family, or the Lampridida, ‘is represented in the Atlantic by a
single species, Lampris guttatus, a pelagic fish, which appears to be
more abundant im the deep waters of northern seas than elsewhere. It
has been observed at many points upon the Norwegian coast, about
Iceland and Madeira, as well as in the Mediterranean, but is of unusual
occurrence everywhere, except perhaps about Madeira. On the coast
of England it is one of the great rarities, and is much sought for by col-
lectors on account of its beauty. It is said to be ove of the most bril-
liantly colored fishes known—‘red and. green, with tints of purple and
gold dotted over with silvery round spots. Iris of the eye is scarlet,
and fins of lively red.’ A specimen was obtained years ago near Sable
Island, Nova Scotia, and the species will doubtless be found still nearer
our shores. It is said that no young specimens have yet been seen.
The species attains the length of 4 feet and more, and is said to be very
excellent eating.”

Everything that has been said above in regard to the various methods
employed in times past, as well as at present, for the preservation of
fishes for exhibition in zodlogical museums and elsewhere applies with
equal truth to reptiles. The day has apparently fully arrived when
400 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

the advanced student of taxidermy will no more think of employing
the old time-honored methods of stuffing a frog or a snake or a tortoise
than he would of mummifying a bird—a practice that was formerly
recommended, it is said, to avoid the apparent difficulty of removing the
skin. Of all the effigies, I think, in the forms of bad taxidermy that
have figured in such nightmares I have suffered from, or in my waking
dreams, the various stuffed snakes I have seen certainly take the palm.
They have been enough to frighten clean out of existence one laboring
under an attack of mania a potu, as well as the reptiles one claims to
see upon such an occasion. It is almost impossible to remove the skin
from any kind of an ordinary snake without disastrously disturbing its
delicate scales and their beautiful arrangement. And, as for the “stuf-
fing” of frogs, why that may be left to those lovers of the “ grotesque
in taxidermy,” for surely such feats have no place in a scientifie ma-
seum, and it has always been a wonder to me how they ever could
claim even a smile from a thorough naturalist, let alone words of praise.

My meaning in these premises will be made perfectly clear by turning
to Plate xx1x, Fig.2, which is from an excellent photograph of a specimen
of Gould’s monitor (Monitor gouldi) now in the collections of the U.S.
National Museum.* This favored representative of the taxidermy of a
past decade, formed a part of the South Austrahan exhibit sent to the
Centennial Exhibition, at Philadelphia, in 1876, and subsequently, pre-
sented to the Institution, where it now is. To the enlightened taxider-
mist my saying itis a stuffed lizard would be all sufficient, but I fain
would invite attention to the absolutely impossible attitude it has been
compelled to assume. It is nailed to the base with coarse pins, whose
heads show on the top of every individual foot. The hind feet are
rammed to a bursting point—the forefeet are empty. To save length
of stand the tail has been forced round to the side, and the toes are
alternately pointing to the four quarters of the globe. We do not pass
favorably upon that kind of work any more, and the only interest it
has for me is the stage it represents in the growth and development of
the art of taxidermy, though it is a comfort to know that the day for
such ridiculous productions is rapidly passing into history.

By whatever method done, the casting of most reptiles has one
great advantage over the casting of most fishes—an advantage to the
extent of exercising a greater skill and knowledge on the part of the
operator, for it must be easy for one to realize that to make a plaster
nold of a flounder and a plaster mold of a frog are two very dif-
ferent matters. The first, beyond a spreading of tail and fins, requires
but little arrangement, whereas in the case of the second I have met
with many a person who could not for the life of him place a dead
frog in a natural attitude, to say nothing of making one ready and
obtaining a plaster mold of it. Lizards are sometimes still worse. It
is now, then, that we come to a point where good photographs, good

models, and good illustrations in the vertebrate series really first
come into play. It is only the exception among fishes that such
necessary adjuncts elsewhere will be found useful. One would hardly

’ think of looking for a model to make a cast of a ‘‘ Needle Gar,” for
instance; he might in the case of such a form as the Goosefish (Lophius
piscatorius); whereas in the case of .an attacking Cobra, or some of
the winged or frilled lizards models would soon be in demand, or at
least very much more so. Snakes form no exception to these remarks,
for the attitudes assumed by them in nature are not only various
in the extreme, but in some cases downright peculiar. And, in good
groups of reptiles peculiar. characters and habits should be exhibited
by showing them or exhibiting them by a duplication of the species
composing the group. The blowing viper (Heterodon) should not only
be preserved and shown with expanded and flattened fore parts, but at
a state of rest likewise. Take another example in the little lizard
Anolis, the American chameleon; we would by no means gain a full
idea of its form and appearance from one specimen, colored bright pea-
green, and the flaming red ornament at the throat retracted; but we
should have a group of at least four or five of them, showing all such
remarkable characters, as well as the various tints it may assume when
it exerts it chameleonic powers. With many lizards and with many
snakes this is not always necessary, and with them one good, faithfully
colored cast will be quite sufficient.

Of course, the very large reptiles, as large Iguanas, Alligators, and
even such large snakes as Anacondas and Pythons, admit of being skill-
fully mounted by the manufacture of bodies made of tow—that is, a
manakin, with internal wire supports and a final clay covering; but, as
I have said, it would appear that the time has come when all small rep-
tiles will no longer be so preserved, and the tendency to cast them is on
the increase. An ingenious method of preserving small reptiles in al-
cohol is resorted to by Mr. Samuel Garman at the Museum of Com-
parative Zoélogy at Harvard College, but I have never had the personal

opportunity of investigating it, though the fact that so able an herpi-
tologist recommends it as is Mr. Garman is enough to say that it pos-
sesses its merits for museum purposes. He claims that by its means
he “can give the specimens life-like attitudes, or arrange them in
groups, as if playing, courting, or fighting; and the liquid heightens
their beauty, as the water does that of the pebble at the seashore,
while ravages of insects are entirely out of the question.”

The larger Chelonia, as the Hawksbill, the Green turtle, the Leather-
back, and the Loggerhead, can also be mounted by the processes usually
recommended by the best taxidermists and successfully, and Mr. Lucas
has pointed out an admirable way for mounting the smaller turtles,*

mists, 188283, pp. 84-90, 2 figs.

402 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

but even this does not convince me but what such mounts will finally
be superseded by the plastic methods and subsequent artistic painting.
I speak especially for the large scientific institutions where a full series
of alcoholics can be maintained in alcohol, and the exhibition series are
intended simply to faithfully present the external characters and ap-
pearances of the specimens.

The National Museum possesses at least one very elegantly preserved
crocodile. Mounted much in the manner pointed out above, it has been
placed in an attitude of rest, with very simple surroundings, but made
the more interesting from the fact that the taxidermist has placed upon
its back one or two specimens of that small Black-headed Plover
(Charadrius melanocephalus), which in nature may often be seen perched
there, attracted as it is by the insects which occur in numbers upon
that part of the huge reptile.

Here we not only get a fine and naturally preserved specimen of an
important and widely known animal, but we likewise have represented
in the most striking manner one of the most engaging chapters in its
history.

In alluding to groups of reptiles, Hornaday, after all his long experi-
ence, has said that—

I know of but one good group of reptiles, and that is a group of turtles which
was prepared by Mr. F. A. Lucas, and displayed at the exhibition of the 8. A. T. in
New York in 1883, where it received a medal, and afterwards was presented by him
to the National Museum. This altogether unique and pretty group teaches one very
important lesson, viz, that even the most commonplace animals are interesting when
they are well mourted and grouped with a setting which represents their natural
haunts. Some of the specimens in this group are represented above water, and some
beneath it, while one enterprising individual is caught in the act of diving, with
half of his body under water and the other half out. The situation represents the
successful accomplishment of a very neat mechanical feat and is of itself an illustra-
tion of the possibilities in such matters.”

3ut progress of the most substantial nature, thanks to Mr. Goode,
is now being made along such lines in his collections of the U.S. National
Museum, and I believe that in a very few years hence the exhibition
series of this institution will stand among the very finest in the world.
The consummate skill of the Palmers, Mr. Lucas, and a large trained
staff of many others of the first ability in designing, painting, and cast-
ing, is sure to make it so. Dr. Stejneger has been kind enough to place
at my disposition a number of the casts of his department (Reptiles),
for which and other courtesies my thanks are here tendered him.

With regard to the attitudes assumed by snakes, we may say that
they are exceedingly numerous and many of them very interesting to
behold. To secure figures of these for the use of modelers and casters
we have a host of fine illustrations throughout the literature of reptiles,
but Iam more and more inclined to believe that a work devoted to a
earfully prepared series of photographs of snakes taken directly in

their natural haunts is in reality what is now most in demand. At
zoological gardens, at least here at Washington, they are usually kept
in wire cages, often huddled together, and rarely assume the animated
attitudes most natural to them, and so, even if photographs could be
obtained of them there, they would hardly meet the endin view. That
they are easily obtained in nature I have recently demonstrated in one
instance for illustrationinthe present connection, though I am confident
with just a little more practice in that way the results can be made all
that is to be desired. About a month ago on my premises I secured a
good-sized Garter snake, uninjured in the jeast degree, and at once
placed him in a large glass jar. Immediately I cut out, on the bank
of a stream on my place, a suitable piece of ground, with plants grow-
ing on it, for my *‘ base.” This | placed out of doors on a large box
about the height of my camera, and for a background behind it I
placed a large sheet of common white blotting paper. My snake was
then removed from his jar and placed on the base. By tapping him
on the head he at once threw himself in the position I secured him in
in the photograph, of which Plate XXVII is a good copy.

Now, this operation altogether took less than an hour, and a fairly
good figure was the result. But it may be accomplished very easily in
another way; for all we have to dois to ‘go afield” armed with our
‘amera and a necessary number of plates, and a thin board covered
with white blotting paper for our background, to be used for cutting
off superfluous foliage, ete. On meeting with a snake, or indeed any
small animal, he way in 50 per cent of the cases be obtained by the
methods above indicated. Recently I have even succeeded in get-
ting them on the ground by placing the camera right down in front
of them, putting up my background, then assuming a prone position
myself, focused and got my figure.

Such a photograph of the Helodermas was obtained by me in New
Mexico. The specimens represented in it were my own; they were
healthy and vigorous, and had been disporting themselves in the sun,
when, becoming tired, they sought the shade of some plants, and as
they assumed positions of rest I there photographed them.

All the figures of snakes given in the present report are from plaster-
of-Paris casts in the collections of the National Museum. They were
all made, I believe, by Mr. Joseph Palmer, and most naturally colored.
They are wonderfully fine things, and a credit to any museum in exist-
ence. But what is still more to the point they faithfully represent the
originals, and that is what we want. Not only are these snakes in
plaster, but so are the tasteful bases of rock, ete., upon which they have
been placed. Take, for example, the rattlesnake shown in east 950.
With tail elevated, and the reptile thrown into natural coils, partly
within the recess of the spreading roots of a large tree, we have an
accomplishment in plaster the equal of which for that particular snake
I do not believe to be extant.
404 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Quite as good is the young Ancistrodon in the collection, for here, too,
the snake is partly within a recess and fully the anterior fourth of the
animal free.

Errors can sometimes occur, however, even in apparently such a sim-
ple procedure as properly coiling up a snake for a plaster cast, and as
fine a work of art as it is in other respects, I am inclined to think that
in nature a snake never so abruptly bends the neck as close to the head
as has been done for the one in Plate xxx. A dead snake may be placed
ina great many postures which in nature it never assumes, and these
dead attitudes must be guarded against; and it is just here where the
results of good photographs of snakes in nature come in most advan-
tageously.

In the coloring of snakes and other reptiles we should rely solely
upon specimens that are alive, and taken as subjects if possible just
after the “shed.” It is almost needless to add that a cast should only
be painted from the snake from which the cast was made, and not
another specimen of the same species. Frogs, for some reason or other,
are not always well drawn and colored, and, as I have before re-
marked, some of the most abominable stuffed specimens and casts of
them are in existence. Those in some of our museums bear no closer
resemblance to the original animal than a camel does to a chestnut
burr. They are simply horrid. This is often the case, too, in many
departments of decorative art. Even our Indians, who occasionally
make pretty good hits, crude as they are, at pictorial decoration with
some of the animals they happen to be most familiar with, miss it
when they try the frog. Attempts made by the Japanese in such mat-
ters are often very much better than the results turned out by the
brushes and implements of our own artists and designers. There is one
very life-like plaster-of-Paris cast, colored, of this Batrachian in the
collections of the National Museum, and it is reproduced in Plate xxx1
of the present paper. It shows the animal in one of its most common
poses, and may well serve as a model for anyone who desires to copy
it for any purpose whatsoever.

Some grand results in the matter of the casting of turtles, both large
and small ones, have been accomplished in the workshops of the
Museum, These are either in plaster-of-Paris like all the specimens
here figured, or in some few cases the natural shell of the animal has
been retained, and the exposed external parts, as head, legs, and tail,
cast in the usual plastic material used, and subsequently fitted to the
former. When cast in plaster-of- Paris, they of course have to be painted,
as in the case of all animals so reproduced. When photographed,
these tints do not show, and consequently my figures, with the par-
tial exception of the box tortoise (Cistudo), exhibit only the form of
the specimen. :

Especial attention is invited to the beautiful cast of Aspidonectes

original. So far as external form is concerned it simply stands as
good as the original, as offering to the naturalists of all ages an abso-
lutely correct idea of this interesting chelonian. Lizards are more
difficult to cast than are turtles, as in many of their details of external
structure they are more delicately formed, and, upon the whole, I do
not think an equal success has been attained at the Museum in the
plaster casting of saurians as has in the case of the chelonians.
Nevertheless the plaster casts of some of the larger lizards leave us
nothing to be desired in that art. A truly magnificent thing is seen in
the plaster cast of Tupinambis (Plate Xxxv). It would seem to be per-
fect in every particular, and by all odds is the finest result of the kind
that I have ever had the pleasure of examining.

Just here this is all 1 have to say in regard to the preservation of
reptiles for museum exhibition, but the subject,in a general way, will
be reverted to again before closing this paper.

We next pass to a consideration of the preservation of birds. Upon
entering this department, after passing fish and reptiles in review, we
seem almost to come into entirely new fields. Zodlogically birds are not
one bit more important than either fishes or reptiles, but from a popular
standpoint they have probably received, as every biologist knows, fully
fifty times the attention. Ornithological literature, taken by and large,
is a hundred fold more voluminous than that of the two other groups just
mentioned put together. Thousands of birds have been preserved by
one method or another (not including alcoholies), to one fish. When one
alludes to the art of taxidermy in the presence of the laity the idea that
first comes up is, that the taxidermy of birds only is intended; mammals
are far less frequently thought of by such people; and fish and reptiles
rarely or never. Plates, figures, drawings, and illustrations of this
group are far more numerous; and, notwithstanding my sincere efforts
to equalize the illustrations for the various departments in this paper,
somehow or other the plates of birds constitute nearly one-half of
them. Many taxidermists devote themselves to birds alone, and it is
only those in this country who are really finished adepts in the art that
ean skillfully handle the preservation of any kind of an animal what-
ever, birds included,

Taking all this into consideration, one would naturally think that that
department of taxidermy had made far greater progress than any other;
but I hasten to say this is by no means the case. If we take the col-
lections of such an institution as the National Museum for example, we
find upon examination that there is quite as much bad taxidermy among
birds as there is among mammals, and when it is bad it-is very bad.
On the other hand, from the host of “ terrifics” that still linger in the
cases of the ornithological department there has been growing out of
it of recent years a most satisfactory and most encouraging progress.
Both individual specimens as well as groups of birds are now being
produced which bear every evidence of the highest accomplishments
406 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

attained to by taxidermists anywhere in the world. There are two great
reasons for this: First, taxidermy itself has only recently been raised
from the plane of mere cheap jobbery to the place it long ago should
have oceupied—that is, to a school of living art; and, second, the selec-
tion from that school foremployment in the Museum of at least a rep-
resentation.

Everything I have thus far said in the foregoing pages in the matter
of models, of grouping, and, indeed, of reproducing nature in the Museum
with respect to fishes and reptiles, applies with equal force to birds.
With regard to the photography of birds in their native haunts and
elsewhere, for the purpose of securing models as guides to natural atti-
tudes of this class of vertebrates for the taxidermic artist, it would seem
to be far more important here than with either reptiles or fish. This is
so from the fact that in the case with the last two the specimens are
now most frequently cast, while, as we well know, with birds it is differ-
ent; they being skinned, the artist must have a model to go by for the
restoration of form.

Where models are not followed, especially in those cases where the
taxidermist may never have seen the bird either alive or even a good
figure of it, the most pitiable results follow. This is well seen in PI.
XXXVI, showing two king penguins—birds of the same species. The
taller of the two was mounted by one of the old sehool-men taxider-
mists years ago, and it is so bad that I consider it quite beyond the
pale of criticism. The second and more upright bird, recently done at
the Museum, although in some particulars not everything it should be,
is such an advance upon the first, that comparison becomes quite unnec-
essary. Bad mounting of the kind just referred to is still more disas-
trous when it has been done in the case of a bird of great rarity, and
consequently of almost priceless value. This was unfortunately the
case in regard to the specimen of the Great Auk (Plautus impennis)
owned by the National Museum. A figure of this as first mounted by
some ancient bungler is shown on PI, xxxvil, Fig. 1. No living auk in
good health ever stood in that position; but thanks to what art can
sometimes accomplish in these days, this outraged bird was not des-
tined for all eternity to stand as a drum-major at dress parade.

It was determined to have it remounted; an operation, owing to the
age of the specimen and a lack of knowledge as to what condition the
skin might be in, that required a full measure of judgment relative to
what taxidermy could hope for in such premises. The work of remod-
eling was accomplished by Mr. Wood, of the National Museum, and the
result is shown in Plate xxxvil, Fig. 2, and this now probably extinet
fowl], one of the treasures of the department, presents a far more respect-
able appearance, and is certainly posed in a far more natural attitude,
though judging from Audubon’s plate of it, I believe it still to be not a
posture this auk was wont to assume. Still, it was most assuredly the

very best that could have been done under the cireumstances; for when
birds’ necks are stretched out of all proportion, and then allowed to
remain that way for years, it is by no means an easy mInatter to even
partially restore them again to their normal lengths. Even among the
more common birds there still linger numerous examples of old-style
bird stuffing in the cases of the National Museum. Some of these abso-
lutely violate every correct principle of taxidermy, and it is devoutly
to be hoped that the time is not far distant when they can be presented
to some fourth-rate museum or college “in the provinces.” Surely
both this Museum and the people have outgrown such scarecrows. I
allude to such looking affairs as we have represented in Plate XXXVIII
of this report, a specimen of Larus occidentalis. Now, gulls make espe-
cially beautiful subjects when they are well mounted; for in nature they
are graceful in the extreme, and their plumages, so simple and so harmo-
niously blended, are very attractive. Plate XxXxIx,a mounted specimen
of Creagrus furcatus in the national collection, is in my opinion an ab-
solutely lifelike reproduction of the bird as it appeared when it was
alive. It is nature and simplicity itself, and, with its neat stand, leaves
nothing to be desired in the way of mounting a single individual in an
attitude of rest.*

There is no class of vertebrates that admit of grouping for museum
exhibition that can exceed birds. Most of the species are small, which
is an advantage, inasmuch it allows us to increase the amount of nat-
ural surroundings; then a great many birds have very peculiar habits
and construct a great variety of nests, and these may often be repro-
duced with the greatest possible interest. t

One of the most lifelike groups of birds known to me is the pair of
Black Ducks (Anas obscura) and young, which form a part of the
ornithological mounted collection of the American Museum of Natural
History of New York City. Through the kindness of Dr. J. A. Allen,

*This gull was the work of Mr. Nelson R. Wood, one of the taxidermists employed
in the National Museum, who also prepared all the mounted domestic fowls and
pigeons here shown with the exception of the white-faced black Spanish cock (Plate
LXIX, Fig. 2); the Parrot (Plate xiv, Figs. 1, 2); the Baltimore oriole (Plate Lx x11) ;
the turkey (Plate xLvul,); and the great horned owl (Plate Lxx11). Mr. Wood
has cheerfully tendered his assistance to me in several ways during my examination
of specimens, for which he fully deserves my thanks, as he does for the loan of his
living specimen of Gambel’s partridge and Black Sumatra cock, both of which by
photography have been secured for plates for this paper.

tAccording to Mr. Goode: ‘‘The mounting of animals in picturesque and lifelike
groups in the midst of accessories taken from their natural haunts appears to have
been first attempted by Prof. Paolo Savi in the early part of the present century.
In the museum of the University of Pisa nearly one hundred of these are still pre-
served. One of these, a group of starlings upon the head of a dead sheep, is as fine
as anything since produced anywhere; and a pair of boar hounds attacking a boar
is, for action, the best piece of mammal mounting I have ever seen. The collection
is a wonderful one, and is still perfectly preserved.”
408 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

of that institution, | am enabled to present that group here as one of
my illustrations. It is shown in Plate xL.*

The subjects shown in Plate xLuL, Parrot; Plate LXx1, California Partridge; Plate
LX11, Massena Partridge; Plate Lx11, Quail; Plate Lix, Fig. 2, Quail; Plate LxIv,
English Pheasant; Plate Lxv, Moor Cock; Plate Lxvu, Ruffled Grouse; Plate LXvit,
Fig. 1, Dusky Grouse; Plate Lxvu, Fig. 2, Richardson’s Grouse, and the well-mounted
turkey head in Plate Lx1x, are all examples of Mr. Denslow’s style of mounting. —
My thanks are due him for the loan of the drawing from which the figure of the
Great Horned Owl, shown in Plate LXxX11, was made. Itis from his well-filled ‘‘ note-
book” of drawings and photographs of all kinds of animals from life and good
illustrations—just such a book as every taxidermist should compile. Mr. Denslow
was at one time employed by the National Museum and is in my opinion a taxider-
mist of the highest order of merit.

Great simplicity may characterize groups of birds, or they may be
gotten up with every refinement of detail. A beautiful piece of work
representing the former style is to be found in the collection, where
two flamingoes and their nests are represented; while of the latter
kind, it would be difficult to find a group anywhere that would present so
Inany interesting features, and such wonderful harmony in detail, as is
seen in the group of jacanas, which, together with the flamingoes, were
senton tothe World’s Columbian Exposition. The piece of pond work in
thislatter, including the flowers and their leaves, and the handling of the
bottom, are simply exquisite. Such work is an adornment to any
museum, and a whole chapter in zodlogical science to any visitor who
may chance to give it any study whatever. The artist, I regret to say,
is not known to me, but there is no question that he knew a jacana.t I
have seen the birds alive in nature, and the way he has rendered the
peculiar habit the males have of vertically erecting their wings, in a
manner similar to our Solitary sandpiper, is capital. This delicate case,
as I have just said, was sent on to the World’s Fair at Chicago, and it
is to be hoped that no misfortune will befall it either in going there
or having it returned here.

Perhaps some of the finest groupsin the world are at South Kensing-
ton of the British Museum, and at the commencement of this paper I
quite extensively quoted from Dr. Sharpe’s article upon the nature of
many of them. That distinguished ornithologist, who is in charge of
the department of ornithology there, has kindly sent me, as I have
before said, two beautiful photographs of their method of mounting
specimens of the diurnal Rajtores. Those photographs, unfortunately,
| had to have very much reduced, but still they show very well the

“This group was designed and prepared by Mr. Jenness Richardson, at the Ameri-
can Museum of Natural History, in 1890; the studies being made from life at Gar-
diner’s Island, New York, in May, 1889. The accessories were made by Mrs. E. S.
Mogridge, under the supervision of Mr. Richardson, and are actual facsimiles from
nature.

iThe group was mounted by Henry Marshall, for many years the principal bird
taxidermist in the National Museum. —Epi7ror.

grandeur of the scale upon which such work isexecuted. Their copies
are faithfully rendered in Plates XLI and XLit, and to study them simply
means to excite our fullest admiration for such bold and truthful ren-
dering. In Plate xu one of the birds is exhibited in full flight, and yet
the rocky wall behind him seems to be in contact with his tail, and, in-
asmuch as thereis no perch for him to have pitched off of in full flight,
the question might naturally arise, going at the rate he apparently is,
whence did he come? The defect so apparent is probably due to the
picture itself, which does not represent the actual and necessary space
that exists between the sailing bird and the rocky cliff behind him.

Such illustrations bring up to my mind the great question of the
amount of activity permissible in birds mounted for museum exhibi-
tion. My opinion in these premises can be briefly put. The great bulk
of individual specimens of small birds exhibited in the cases of a large
scientific zodlogical museum should be mounted up on the T of the
perch in one of the most common attitudes of the species; a slight dip-
ping forwards, cr slight inclination of the head in some direction, being
alone permissible. But this would give rise to great monotony, and to
| break that we would advise a certain amount of activity in single spee-
|imens. This should be accorded to those birds which normally are very
| active in nature. With respect to groups of birds we may to a greater
| extent indulge in arranging birds in different attitudes. At the best
| this is what we would naturally look for anyway, for in groups of birds
| the individuals composing 1t are more frequently mounted in the act
| of performing something, either feeding their young or flying, or nest-
| building, or some other avocation. Even violent action, as fighting
each other, or capturing their prey, may be introduced in a limited
number of groups.

The scolding parrot, shownin Plate xLit, which, by the way, isamas-
| terly piece of work, is an excellent example of activity shown in a single
specimen, and this one subject would give relief to a dozen quiet par-
rots in the same case; or, for example, the other species, equally as well
rendered, shown in two views in Plate xLrv, Figs. 1 and 2. For ordinary
small birds the style shown for the female oriole in Plate LXxItr is some-
_ times desirable, especially when a bird is selected having such active hab-
its as the oriole has, and where the artist can succeed in reproducing one
of its more usual postures as well as has been done in the case of this

specimen. Otherwise it most certainly shotld not be attempted. But
the acme of all activity and of all grouping is reached when such artis-
tie pieces of work, so faithfully executed, so full of interest and all that
is natural, are set forth as the piece shown in Plate xLvy. Mr. Adams,
who both collected and mounted this most attractive thing, would cer-
tainly have “capped the climax” had he been able to have brought
home the very section of the tree in which that identical Hornbill built
her nest. This part is artificial, having been built up of fine papier-
-mnaché; butitisonly fairly well done. Itrepresents the maleof one of the

A10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

species of Hornbills feeding the female, whom he has imprisoned during
the period of incubation in a hollow tree. I never pass it that I do not
think of what Wallace has said of the habit in his Malay Archipelago
(p. 147):

I had sent my hunters to shoot and while I was at breakfast they returned, bring-
ing me a fine large male of the Buceros bicornis, which one of them assured me he
had shot while feeding the female, which was shut up in a hole in a tree. I had
often read of this curions habit, and immediately returned to the place, accompa-
nied by several of the natives. After crossing a stream and a bog, we found a large
tree leaning over some water, and on its lower side, at a height of about 20 feet,
appeared a small hole, and what looked like a quantity of mud, which I was assured
had been used in stopping up the large hole. After a while we heard the harsh cry
of a bird inside, and could see the white extremity of its beak put out. I offered a
rupee to anyone who would go up and get out the bird, with the egg or young one,
but they all declared it was too difficult and they were afraid to try. I therefore
very reluctantly came away. In about an hour afterward, much to my surprise, a
tremendous loud, hoarse screaming was heard, and the bird was brought me, to-
gether with a young one which had been found in the hole. This was a most curi-
ous object, as large as a pigeon, but without a pa ticle of plumage on any part of it.
It was exceedingly plump and soft, and with a semitransparent skin, so that it
looked more like a bag of jelly with head and feet stuck on than like a real bird.

The extraordinary habit of the male in plastering up the female with her egg and
feeding her during the whole time of incubation and till the young one is fledged, is
common to several of the large hornbills, and is one of those strange facts in natural
history which are ‘‘ stranger than fiction.”

A very favorable commencement has been made at the National
Museun of illustrating our own native birds by similar methods, and
it would not be easy to overestimate the value and interest that
attach to so important a step. We have already in one handsome
single case a pair of shrikes with their nest and young in a thorn-apple
bush, while upon several of the spines of the latter are suspended vari-
ous insects and a small mammal, showing the habit of those interesting
birds in nature of thus impaling such creatures. Others are in the
course of making, and still othersin contemplation. A pair of Wood
Ducks with their real nest, taken from some lofty tree, is a good sub-
ject for some enterprising artist, and many others suggest themselves
tous. There were magnificent groups of our birds sent on to the
Columbian Exposition at Chicago, and when these are returned, as
they will be, it will form a fine basis for such a collection to be added
to in the future. I fear I must leave a great deal unsaid here that I
would like to say, but it is to be devoutly hoped that the wide interest
our people are taking in such matters, and the national desire of build-
ing up a National Museum at our fair capital, will induce our Govern-
ment to open the public purse to the extent of bestowing the room
required for the proper exhibition of this series, even to the giving of a
large and suitable building, now so much needed through the rapid
increase and accumulation of such treasures.

This will be the more necessary inasmuch as within a few years past,

through the wise foresight of Mr. Goode, another very important de- ”

partment is growing up at the Government museums, and this in the
field we now have under consideration, and it is the exhibition of the
finest possible specimens of all our domesticated fowls, especially
pigeons, chickens, and the like. So far as the art has applied itself to
the preservation and representation of these lately, it has been most
satisfactory, and many masterpieces of this kind now adorn the series.

‘The style in which the fowls are being done is well exemplified in
Plates xLviand xtvu. Mr. C. A. Sharp, of Lockport, N. Y., imported
the birds there shown from England. They are both prize-winners, and
both splendid samples of Indian game fowl, cock and hen. At their
death they were presented by Mr. Sharp to the National Museum.
‘‘Lady Whitfield,” the hen, is an hundred-dollar bird, while her consort
brought $350. From an ‘artistic point of view, in so far as taxidermy
is concerned, they are markedly superior pieces of workmanship and
in every particular—pose, topographical anatomy, coloring, spirit, and
all. To appreciate their beauty, we have but to compare them with
some of the taxidermy that was done during the old régime of the
Museuw’s history. I mean such types of it as I am enabled to show in
Plate xix, Fig. 2—a White-faced black Spanish cock—a relic I ex-
humed from the vaults of the specimens now being discarded. Whata
beauty (?)—saddle-backed, tail thrown up like a toucan’s, wires show-
ing everywhere, most all of his body in front of his legs, stepping off
with both feet flat on the ground, and such a weird, grotesque, con-
sequential, lop-sided aspect anyway—this fright with no form of a fowl
known to me is only fit to grace the front window of a fourth-class cheap
bird “stuffer’s” shop. A few more such “spooks” as this still linger on
exhibition, as if by courtesy to the past, but they will shortly have to
make way before the work now coming in.

Sometimes these game cocks are “ undubbed,” that is their wattles
and comb are not trimmed off. In preserving these parts in a bird like
this they are cast from the original and restored in a plastic material,
that will keep indetinitely without change of form or color. After the
bird is mounted, these are properly attached in their places on the
head, and the suture lines colored over. The effect is absolutely per-
fect, and to show how perfect it is I have introduced two additional
figures, nearly life size, of the head of a game cock (Plate xLvu1, Figs.
1,2). They will bear the minutest inspection from every critical point
known to taxidermists. In Fig. 2 the eye is unfortunately marred by
the light refraction, but we can not avoid that in photography. Thor-
oughly lifelike again is the pretty specimen shown in Plate L, a Silver-
spangled Hamburg hen. The artist who mounted this specimen is
a close student at all times of the various attitudes assumed not only
by fowls and pigeons of all kinds, but of the feathered creation at
large, and in this instance has happily hit the appearance of a hen
feeding as she walks along or regarding some small object on tne
ground that has attracted her attention.
412 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Another worthy subject is seen in Plate xL1x, Fig. 1, a proud old
black Sumatra cock, that comes from a line of fowls unsurpassed by
any in beauty or from. Mr. Wood, of the Museum, owns one or more
of the grandsons of the rooster here portrayed, and through the skill
and patience of Mr. T. W. Smillie, in charge of the photographic gallery
of the National Museum, I am enabled to present figures from photo-
graphs of this cock, taken from the live bird. 7

They are valuable as models, going to show the disposition of plum-
age, the contour of general form, its attitudes, and general appear-
ance. These fowls are black all over, with strong blue and green
reflections in every changing light. Special attention is invited to the
elegant manner in which the superb tail is horizontally carried and the
proud carriage of the bird in Plate Lx1. Oye artists of the pen and
block who diligently illustrate for our thousand and one agricultural
periodicals all over this country, and sometimes do not quite hit in your
efforts the galline form divine, pray look upon these portraits before
getting down to your easeis again, and profit thereby!

Other remarkably fine pieces of work of this kind are seen in Plates
LU,LIv,anduLv. They are all equally good and deserving of the highest
compliment that I can give them, and that is they are absolutely true
to nature. My only regret is that they are not colored as well, for they
would then be still more lifelike and their real beauties greatly enhanced.
This factor is not so much missed in the good old light Brahma hen in
Plate LV, for she is largely black and white. She was presented to the
National Museum by Mr. Charles Griffin, of Shelter Island—with the
cock that goes with her they constitute a pair of fowls of great beauty.
(Plate Liv and LV.)

Many of the domestic pigeons have also been treated at the Museum
quite as artistically as have the fowls. No opportunities have been lost
to catch these in their every mood, and reproduce them in preserved
specimens of the individuals themselves. One of the prettiest subjects
sent on to the Chicago fair by the National Museum was a large pigeon-
cot covered with many varieties of our tame pigeons, both the common
and the rarer kinds. It was gotten up by Mr. Lucas in a manner that
admitted of no improvement, bearing as it did a true likeness to an
original. Two of the pigeons that were upon it are shown in Plate LvI
and Lyi. When one thinks of the stiff and uncouth things that so
many taxidermists give us and call them pigeons, it is positively grate-
ful to turn to these here shown, and observe the eminently natural atti-
tudes in which these gentle creatures have been thrown. One of the
prettiest pieces of taxidermy that I have ever had the pleasure of study-
ing is the dozing dovecot pigeon, depicted in Plate Lv1. We hope that
this collection, now so well advanced, will continue to grow both nu-
merically and in the variety ot the species. Were it possible to obtain
some of the steps in Mr. Darwin’s numerous experiments with pigeons,
and all that he demonstrated thereby, and the corresponding forms and

crosses could be obtained, the plan would not be a bad one to devote a
few cases to illustrate so important a subject.

When we come to study the collection of mounted specimens of the
Galline in the ornithological cases of the Smithsonian Institution in
the large hall where all the mounted birds are exhibited, we find the
same condition of affairs presented to us, as has been deseribed for the
. other avian groups. Inferiority of work, as a rule, characterizes the
older specimens, while real merit marks the most of those that have
appeared within comparatively recent times. This appears to have
been the case, in so far as the latter kind are concerned, during a period
extending over perhaps a twelve month prior to the opening of the
World’s Columbian Exposition. Some fine work began to make its
appearance just then, due apparently to that cause, which was having
a Similar stimulating influence in all quarters, no art or industry being
exempt from it. The advances in methods and results was being
silently watched by me with a keen interest and appreciation, not to
say a feeling of pride and exultation at the genuine gain that was being
made in such matters.

My attention, among other things, was especially drawn towards the
group to which allusion has just been made, particularly the American
partridges and grouse and their allies. Some of the species of par-
tridges that were being mounted and placed in the cases struck me as be-
ing more life-like than was common, and I mentally compared them with
my recollections of the living species in nature, as well as all the figures I
knew of them. As the present paper began to take on form I deter-
mined, if possible, to introduce copies of a few photographs of living
partridges, and, as has been mentioned on a previous page, the opportu-
nity was duly presented. Mr. Smillie was good enough in my presence
to make several exposures upon a living specimen of Gambel’s partridge,
and some of those results are well worthy of publication. They are
presented in Plate Lix, Fig. 1, and Plate Lx. In the first figure the
bird had elevated all his feathers just prior to preening himself. This
in a way should be compared with the quail shown in Fig. 2, recollect-
ing, however, that the living bird is not on the ground and that the
mounted one is done with the act of preening and is just about to shake
herself.

In Plate Lx the bird was taken as it sat quietly upon a perch, and
slightly elevated the feathers at the neck and forepart of the body. It
shows that one of the feathers of its plume was broken and hung down
below the others and is not a shadow, as might by some be supposed.
This figure is a fine model for those whe may desire to mount a par-
tridge in this attitude. Although of a differeut genus, it is interesting
to compare this with the partridge shown in Plate Lx1i1, which is one
of the best mounted specimens of a Colinus with which I am acquainted.
It will be noticed that the slight flatness that naturally exists over the
pectoral region is apparent in both the living bird and in the specimen
414 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

‘shown in Plate Lxinm. This feature should also be compared with what
we see in Plate Lx.

Some excellent judges of the taxidermy of birds have spoken very
highly of the California partridge shown in Plate Lx1, and though ap-
parently in all essential respects faultless in workmanship, design, and
execution, it is to me not as pleasing a result as the Cyrtonyx seen in
Plate Lxu. Birds of the latter species I have seen in New Mexico, and
in nature they exactly have the form here shown. The model used in this
case, however, was from the figure in Gould’s monograph on the Odon-
tophorine, while in the case of the California partridge it was from life.

Of the larger game birds the Museum has quite a number of a char-
acter not to be excelled by any institution in the world, and probably
not fully equaled by any other in this country. They must excite even
the admiration of those who care ever so little for either ornithology or
for the feats of pure art in taxidermy. But such people, fortunately,
Tam not now dealing with and care less for. But tell me, where is the
naturalist, or the sportsman, or the taxidermist, or the cultured any-
where who can not see the extreme beauty and excellence in such
specimens as I have been permitted to present in such a piece as the
Pheasant portrayed in Plate LXxIv, or the moor cock shown in the next
plate following, or Plate Lxv. It is too bad we can not show the color
in such a specimen as this, for it is surely a gorgeous fowl. There is
another specimen of the moor cock in the collection and the taxider-
mist has attempted to mount it in an attitude of strutting on a log, or
a large bough, [ do not remember which now, for I only remember the
unpleasant sensation left upon me after having seen the bird itself. It
has the appearance as though it was about to have a spasm. It is an
excellent example of—very bad taxidermy.

Wolf’s superb drawings formalmost an inexhaustible supply of grace-
ful and accurate postures and positions of all kinds of vertebrates, and
it was from that work that the artist secured his model for the Ruffed
grouse reproduced in Plate Lxvi. In placing this, however, before the
camera I gave it a front view rather than a lateral one, this being, as
is well known, one of the severest tests to which you can submit the
artist’s work, especially in a piece of this kind. How well it stands it
others must be left to judge; for my own part and in my humble
opinion it represents to a line, to a feather, a startled grouse as he
regards from the bough of atree the object that has alarmed him. The
balance, with upper wing slightly lowered, with tail flatly outspread,
raised rufts, and eager look, the position of the feet—indeed the entire
poise is admirable throughout.

In order to show how wellsome of the other species of our grouse have
been preserved [chose the two shown in Plate Lxvu, Figs. 1, 2, either of
which are as good as they can be made. It would have been an easy
matter here to have selected a dozen or more mounted specimens of
grouse from the collection that would have shown how bad these birds

can be mounted when they fall into the hands of the unskilled. It is
better, however, I think to forget and forgive all that has been done
in the past, provided we continually strive to copy nature as closely as
possible in the future. To this end I reproduced as many good models
as possible, and have given only a few showing how taxidermy ought
notto be done. Examples of the ‘“‘ how-not-to-do-it” kind have been in-
troduced here and there only as warnings.

Our wild turkey seems always to have given trouble to the old-time
taxidermists, and some perfect frights are made to do duty for that noble
fowl in the collection. Some of these are so badly prepared that they
are downright hideous, while in some respects they fail to give any idea
of the bird or its appearance in nature. The taxidermy of the turkey,
moreover, presents difficulties that are to be encountered only in a lim-
ited number of birds in any avifauna. Chief among these problems is
the proper preservation of the practically featherless head. ‘This is not
only without feathers, as we know, but in life is highly colored, corru-
gated, and wattled below. Whoever it was that prepared the turkeys
in former times that now disgrace the cases of the ornithological depart-
ment I do not pretend to know, any more than I know the reason why
such miserable fifth-class pieces of work are retained there, unless it
be something after the order of Chinese ancestry worship, and an op-
posing of the methods of the moderns.

To condemn the bad and to recommend every result that reproduces
nature is ny object here, and this thought was uppermost in my mind
when the comparison made in Plate LXTx was undertaken. As one looks
at this plate the left-hand head shows how wretchedly bad meleagrine
taxidermy may be done sometimes: The wattle-like comb has had no
pains whatever taken with it, and appears more like a curved, semi-
erect, filamentous horn than anything else; the skin of the head has
been stretched down an inch lower than it belongs, rendered possible
by the “stuffer” eliminating all the corrugations that naturally occur
in it; then the feathers that belong on the back of the neck are twisted
round to the front. After it was dry he further insulted the poor bird
by blotching his neck all over with red, white,and blue paint—patriotic,
but a villainous practice notwithstanding.

Compare this with the second head in the same plate. In the first
place it is perfect in form, and all the parts are naturally disposed.
This bird’s head is restored in wax—that, is the skin of it is, together
with the comb and antero-inferior wattles. In this the proper colors
have been so adroitly incorporated that the effect produced is life-like
in the highest degree. Even the little hair-like feathers have been by
a process of the art normally scattered in their places over the head.
The remainder of the bird is prepared quite in keeping with this truly
beautifully preserved specimen. Anold gobbler of this species is shown
in Plate Lxvill. He is mounted in the act of strutting, and the models
for it have been furnished principally by the act as it is performed by
416 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

the domesticated bird. I consider this to be one of the finest pieces of
modern taxidermy, so far as birds are concerned, in the museum. The
arrangement of the exceedingly profuse plumage is perfect; the mark-
edly oblique tilting of the spread tail, a feature that it is difficult to
appreciate in the plate, is most truthfully rendered. This bird’s head
was prepared after the usual methods, but I understand it is contem-
plated to model it in wax, like the one just described above. When
this is done I believe the National Museum will possess the finest
specimen of a mounted wild turkey in existence.

Owls have not only given a great many artists infinite trouble to
correctly portray, but they have likewise been placed upon the black
list of a perfect host of taxidermists. Literature illumed by plates of
birds goes to show that many an ornithologist who could draw and
paint nearly every other kind of bird failed when owls were essayed.
So, too, there are taxidermists who can mount most all birds correctly,
who fail to a large extent when they take any of the Striges in hand.
Wilson, the American ornithologist, used to complain bitterly of his in-
ability to figure any of these birds exactly to his liking, and even the
master, Audubon, shows a little weakness sometimes in such directions.
Now, in my first attempts at the photography of birds, owls were the
subjects, and one might think, inasmuch as they quietly roost and
doze nearly all day, that is, the strictly nocturnal species, they would
be easy subjects, but this is by no means always the case. A number
of years ago, in New Mexico, I frequently tried specimens of Aiken’s
Sereech owl (Megascops asio aikeni), but the results obtained were never
entirely satisfactory to me. I have kept many kinds of American
owls alive in my lifetime, and these screech owls have a habit, com-
mon to some other species during their dozing hours during the day,
of drawing themselves up in an erect attitude, with all the feathers
compressed against the body, and with the plunicorns erected to their
fullest extent. But when we come to try and photograph one in such
a desirable attitude, we must, to get him anythivg like life size, get
the camera within a very few inches of his owlship, and this almost
invariably alarms him, and he will flatten out his plumicorns, puff him-
self up, and then, after a second’s idiotic stare, fly to some other part of
the room. Photographing them at a longer distance makes the figure
of him too small.

I was once a whole day here at Takoma endeavoring to secure a pho-
tographof oneof our Common Screech owls (Megascops asio) in my room—
and then failed. He would jump up on top of my camera, emit a loud,
rolling whistling note of disapproval of the procedure, dash off and
finaliy nearly brain himself by bumping into the mirror of my wardrobe.
Vd hypnotize him, stand him on the perch, and disappear for half an
hour, and on my return he would be standing up as straight as a rocket
in just the position I wanted him, but all my efforts to sneak up to the
camera aud remove the cap and make the necessary exposure failed

utterly, for he would reénact the same performance I have just described.
Finally I tied a piece of strong pack thread to his leg and took him out
of doors, took him in the broiling glare of the sun, and giving him a
blotting-paper background and a pretty perch, i went at him again.
After numerous attempts I secured the fairly good result shown in
Plate Lxx. When obtained he was staring his eyes out at a chicken that
was making a disturbance not far away, and with a pin-hole diaphragm
in, I gave him an exposure of at least ten seconds, during which time
he never moved. His right foot exhibited an old dislocation, and its
twisted position is evident in his picture. I am indebted to Master
Richard Lay, of Takoma, D. C., for the loan of this bird, for which and
for his trouble in capturing it for me I desire here to express my grate-
ful acknowledgments. It is my intention to experiment with the pho-
tography of owls until I succeed in getting a fine series of them in all
possible poses, with the hope that when duly published they will prove
useful to both artist and taxidermist. On a former page I have invited
attention to the picture of the owl shown in Plate Lxxi. It is a plate
made from a photograph of a drawing that was accurately copied from
the original photograph of the bird, and is a good result and ought to
prove useful both to the artist and to the taxidermist. This plufting up
of the feathers in Bubo is common practice with them, and the act, to
a moderate degree, has been well rendered in the exceptionally fine
mount of one of the bubonine owls. which I offer in Plate Lxxtr. It
shows the bird in what might be called the first stage of observant
defiance, or when something, evidently not of a pleasing nature, has
attracted his attention and he is “getting on a ready” to repel it. The
original has but to be seen to be admired, for it is remarkably well
done.

There is not much encouragement to the taxidermist if the ever pres-
ent fact is before him that the work with which he has taken so much
pains, and given so much of his labor, is at last to be but poorly exhib-
ited; that is, his birds are to be huddled together in small and unsuit-
able cases, and those in an illy-lighted hall. Unfortunately this is just
what exists in the ornithological department now in the old Smithson-
ian Institution building, where certainly 50 per cent of the room space
is. particularly not of the proper kind wherein to exhibit birds. This
subject, though not altogether foreign to the present report, is in reality
one that should be far more extensively dealt with than I will be ena-
bled to do in this connection.

Of all the departments of the art of taxidermy none can exceed, and
I doubt any can quite equal, the talent required to properly preserve
mammals. This is due to the fact that in a vast majority of them the
hair is sufficiently short to exhibit the anatomical contours of the body,
head, and limbs, while in some the hair is practically entirely absent,
and this very much increases the difficulty. The proper handling of
the mouth and associated structures, of certain special organs, and of

A418 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

the feet and ears, etc., all conduces to this. And so, of a consequence,
it especially devolves upon the taxidermist of the class of the vertebrata
to provide himself with accurate drawings and with photographs of
mammals, also with casts and figures of the skinned bodies and parts
of bodies of his subjects. This is just what the sculptor is obliged to
do in his art, and I remember very well, years ago, when I enjoyed the
rare opportunity of watching Mr. John Rodgers at work in his studio.
I have known him to carefully measure as many as thirty well-formed
horses and take the average of those measurements so as to get at the
data to model a handsome animal for a statuette of Washington. Not
content with this, he had also in his room a complete series of plaster
casts of the superficial muscles and other structures demonstrating
equine morphology. :

Further, all the principles I have referred to in the taxidermy of
birds apply, almost without exception, to the class now to be consid-
ered. Groups are of especial interest where mammals are the subjects,
and the National Museum has some of the grandest of them now on
exhibition as a partof her mammalian series known to any institution
of the present time. Take, for example, the group of American opos-
sums in the collection. This was mounted by Mr. Hornaday, who has
described it in the following words in his work ontaxidermy. He says:

The case which incloses the entire group is 4 feet long, 3 feet wide, and 3 feet
high. The frame of the case is as light as possible, and all four sides and the top
are of glass. On the side of a sloping bank stands the base of a small gum tree,
with the roots on the lower side exposed by the crumbling away of the bark. Of
course the trunk rises to the top of the case, where it is cut squarely off. At the
bottom of the sloping bank between two of the roots is an opening, which is recog-
nized at once as the doorway to the opossuim’s home. The burrow winds upward
between the roots of the tree, and finally turns off to the left into the bank, where,
after running through a passageway of 2 or 3 feet in length, the nest itself is found.
Tt is ina pocket-like excavation, and a circular section is cut out of the front of the
bank so as to make an opening through which the nest can be seen. *

The nest is lined with dead leaves, in which lies an opossum curled up and sound
asleep. At the back of the case a sectional view of the bank is represented, and by
means of an opening cut here and there the course of the burrow is plainly seen.
In the foreground is an old mother opossum with several young ones riding on her
back, clinging to her gray coat, while the head of another protrudes from her
pouch. This represents the manner in which the opossum carries her young after
they have reached a certain age. From a small branch hangs another opossum, sus-
pended by its prehensile tail, sprawling in midair. This specimen is a female, and
shows the size and location of the wonderful marsupial pouch.t Another individual

* This I take to be the only real defect in this otherwise masterly piece of taxi-
dermic art. That cut, subcireular as it is, is constantly being mistaken for the real
entrance made by the animal to its burrow, and what is the true opening between
the roots of the tree often overlooked. The false cut should have been made on the
end of the bank, where the side glass covers its supposed section, and we could have
seen into the burrow through it. This can easily be remedied.

t This individual does not appear in the group as it is now exhibited. but forms a
separate piece,

is climbing up the trunk of the tree. A fourth specimen, which has been disturbed
by another, is pausing to protest with widely opened mouth, while in the act of
creeping into the mouth of the burrow.

Please notice the number of facts that are taught by this simple little group. It

shows that the opossum is a marsupial, and the female carries her young in a pouch
in her own body; that when the young reach a certain age they ride upon the
‘mother’s back, clinging to her fur; that the animal is arboreal in habit and has a
prehensile tail, by which it is capable of suspending itself; that it burrows in banks
in dry situations, and sleeps curled up like a ball in a bed of dry leaves. It also
shows the full size of the adult, the young of the previous year, and the recent
brood. But for an unfortunate accident, which has yet to be repaired, it would
also show the number born at one birth. Of course in this group the grass and moss
are properly represented, and there are artificial leaves on the tree branches which
enter the group (pp. 240, 241).

Very truly Mr. Hornaday further remarks in the succeeding para-
graph:

Groups of this class can easily be made to show the ordinary nesting and breeding
habits of the animals represented. Now it happens that animals of some species
make a variety of nests, according to circumstances or caprice. In 1889 we prepared
a group in three sectious, each of which shows one of the habits of the gray squirrel
in nesting. Each is composed of an actual nest, and in the identical tree in which
it was built by Bunny himself. One represents a nest in a hollow beech tree, in
which a pair of gray squirrels bred for years. Another is what might be called a
summer nest, made of cedar bark, in the top of a cedar tree. The third section
represents an outside nest of green oak leaves, placed on a branch of an oak tree.
These three groups are exhibited in one case, but while each is separated from the
others by a plate of heavy tinted glass, it is made apparent that they all illustrate
the habits of the same animal. The specimens composing the three groups were all
collected within a radius of 10 miles of the city of Washington. Besides teaching
what the nesting habits of the gray squirrel are, it also impresses upon the observer
the very important fact that the habits of different individuals of a given species
are capable of wide variation.* They show how dangerous it is for a student or
scientific investigator to generalize too freely from one or two facts, and that it is
dangerous for anyone to say what an animal will not do (). 242).

Another scientifically mounted marsupial in the collection is seen in
the single specimen of the great Rock Kangaroo (Macropus robustus)
(Plate Lxxtv). This piece of work was done by Mr. Jenness Richardson,
then holding the position of taxidermist of the American Museum of Nat-
ural Historyof New York City, N. Y., where he produced some avian and
mammalian groups quite worthy of his distinguished instructor, the
artist from whom I have just been quoting. This large and thoroughly
life-like specimen, place din an attitude so natural to it, and with every
structural detail so perfectly preserved, is decidedly the best kangaroo
in the museum, and being so good, it has the effect of still further

family kept in its proximity in themammal hall. Some of these are so
bad that they have been ordered into the workshops for remodeling.
Such a one is shown in Plate Lxxv, and it is a.very good example of
how kangaroos ought not to be mounted.

About as near perfect as mammalian groups can be made is another
one in the collection seen in the armadilloes (Plate Lxxv1). This has
three animals preserved in it, all in different positions, while the sur-
roundings, as plants, cacti, etc., are originals that have been collected in
the section where these interesting animals are found. So far as its tax1-
dermy is concerned, it may be said that the form of the armadillo is
more or less fixed, yet it presents problems to the taxidermist which
are quite as difficult to deal with as is the fitting the skin of a hairy
mammal to its manakin. If £ remember (for the group has at the
present writing gone on to the World’s Fair at Chicago), some of the
accessories in it, as the cacti, are casts, but their reproduction is so
perfect, spines and all, that it is simply impossible to distinguish them
from the plants as they occur in‘ nature. Speaking of cacti and this
group of armadilloes reminds me of a conversation that I had with
Mr. William Palmer, who is now doing such admirable work in the
taxidermy of mammalian groups at the Museum, in regard to the
reproducing in some group a specimen of the giant cactus of our
extreme southwestern territorial districts. It may be introduced with
great effect in some one of a variety of ways, either in the mammal or
the ornithological department, and it is to be hoped that that will be
done some time in the near future. Mr. H. W. Henshaw once remarked
to me that he found a species of our pigmy owls breeding in holes in
the giant cactus, and a group embodying this idea would certainly be
one of great value and interest.

A group of mammals requiring an entirely different kind of handling
from any we have thus far noticed is seen in the Cetaceans. Papier-
maché is here the material to reproduce its various species in the most
satisfactory manner, and a very fine example of this is seen in the cast of
Prodelphinus plagiodon (Cope), shown in Plate Lxxvia. Here much
depends upon the skill of the colorist, and the smooth surface of the
material used offers a beautiful ground to him whereupon to reproduce
the exact natural tints of the animal as it is seen in nature. Mr. Shin-
dler, of the Museun, is an adept at much of this, and examples of his
skill are best shown in some of the fishes which were noticed upon a
preceding page of this report. Incidentally it may be said that to the
zoologist this species of Dolphin is a very interesting one, and its char-
acteristies and relationships have been set forth by Mr. F. W. True in
Bulletin No. 36 of the U. S. National Museum publications, entitled
“Contributions to the Natural History of the Cetaceans, a Review of
the Family Delphinide” (p. 66). By all odds the papier-maché cast
is the most effective way in which to reproduce the cetaceans for
museum exhibitions.

I desire now, at this point, to invite attention to one of the larger

groups of mammals on exhibition at the Museum, and I will select that
magnificent piece of taxidermic work seen in the moose group. A
number of these massive cervidine animals have actually been mounted
with the most perfect surroundings of their natural habitat in one great
interesting collection, all under a single glass case. They are, probably
without exception, altogether the finest series of mounted moose in this
or any other country.

The act of the young buck riding down a sapling has been questioned
by some, but I believe that the practice of the animal to accomplish that
feat in order to reach the delicate foliage of the tree can be well sub-
stantiated.

Hornaday has said of this piece in his Taxidermy (pp. 246, 247):

The setting represents a section of the moose woods of upper Canada, in which
the larger animals are browsing on the tender twigs of the white birch. The
animals have come together at the edge of a bog, which is growing full of a
gigantic species of grayish moss peculiar to that locality. The time represented is
the middle of autumn. The few leaves that remain on the maple saplings have
been painted with October’s most gorgeous tints of crimson and yellow, mixed
with green, and the leaves of the white birch have turned paie yellow. The ground
is plentifully strewn with leaves of bright tints, through which the green moss of
moist banks shows in patches here and there.

Of the animals, the three largest—and huge beasts they are, truly—are feeding
npon the birch twigs. A yearling calf is licking the head of a tiny brown-coated
younger brother, while a two-year-old bull is in the act of ‘‘ riding down” a stout
birch sapling in order to get at the branches of its top, which would otherwise be
beyond his reach.

Three of these fine specimens were collected by Col. Cecil Clay, of
Washington, and by him presented to the Museum for this group,
together with the trees, moss, and other accessories, which he collected
with infinite labor and care in the moose woods. He also furnished us
with field notes and critical advice throughout, which had much to do
in making the group what it is—a monument to Col. Clay’s skill and
prowess as a sportsman, and to his deep interest in Alces malchis. It
is to be sincerely hoped that other sportsmen will follow the colonel’s
admirable example, and aid the museums in which they are most inter-
ested to secure some attractive groups. There can be no doubt what-
ever as to the perfectness in which these animals are mounted and pre-
served, and they are apparently in their external forms very true to
nature. While we have the taxidermy of the Cervidse under consid-
eration, however, it would appear to be as well to refer to one great
common defect that we have frequently observed made by taxidermists
in them, and that is the lack of care that is sometimes evident in the
proper handling of the lacrymal depression in these animals, or in
other words, the pit which occurs in so many of them just anterior to
the distal canthus of the eye. I have seen plenty of deer heads which,
from an artistic standpoint were otherwise very creditable pieces of
work, but in which this fossa had been almost or quite obliterated. It
422 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

is to the strict attention to such anatomical details that very often the
success and reputation of a taxidermist depends, and he ean do no
better than to see well to it that no such fiaws creep into his perform-
ances. :

This group of moose is about the only notable thing of the kind that
the National Museum has for the Cervide at present, but this does
not mean to imply that a general poverty exists in so far as that fam-
ily is concerned. ‘There are a goodly number of individual pieces of
deer, some of which, however, are deplorable-looking objects, and
fitting relics of those days when taxidermy had not reached to what it
can do so well in these times. Among the better specimens we observe
a fine piece in that representative of the antelope group known as
Thomson’s Gazelle (Gazella thomsonii), Plate Lxxvi. It has been
entered as No, 18964 of the collection of the Museum, and has been
recently described by Mr. True in his “An Annotated Catalogue of
the Animals Collected by Dr. W. L. Abbott in the Kilima-Njaro
Region, East Africa.” (Proc. U.S. Nat. Mus. v, xv, p. 473., Pl. LXxvm,
1892). The faults in the mounting of this specimen are of so trivial a
nature that it is not worth my while to enumerate them here, and were
all the deer and their kin preserved as well as this specimen is, it would
be far more of a pleasure to the sensitiye naturalist to gaze upon them,
who is now pardonably often shocked upon viewing some of his favor-
ites in the museum cases.

But to return to the groups, we have now to notice perhaps one of
the very finest accomplishments that the art of taxidermy has produced
in this country. I refer to the case containing the several specimens
of our now nearly extinet bison or American buffalo. This triumph
in the preservation of mammals of ponderous proportions is almost
entirely due to the consummate skill and perseverance of Hornaday,
who has popuiarly described it in many places. This latter fact, taken
in connection with the fine Plate (LXXx1x) I have been permitted to give
of it, renders it obviously unnecessary for me to dwell upon the general
appearance of this life-like herd of bovines. They are all true to the
life, preserved by all the most efficient methods of modern taxidermy,
and, what is not generally known by people who are, or have been, priv-
ileged to see this case, that the very sod upon which these animals now
stand was brought for the purpose all the way from Montana, being
Shipped direct from the buffalo ranges of that territory to Washington.
This applies also to the sage-brush which is made to appear to be actu-
ally growing therein; and the broom-sedge, and the cacti. The skulls
and other bones of the buffalo lying about were gathered in the same
place; indeed, as a whole, it is a’strip of a Moana prairie of an old
range of these animals, picked up piecemeal, and now again unfolded
in the case at the Museum just as it occurred in nature. Even the very
buffalo tracks seen about the pool of water in the case were made by
using a real buffalo’s hoof for the stamp to make the impressions. No

art known to me has ever accomplished a grander feat than this, and
it is as fully worthy of our unstinted admiration as is any form that has
ever materialized beneath the chisel of an Angelo or a Hiram Powers.
And were I to choose between being the author of Paul Potter’s bull
and these buffalo, I should without a moment’s hesitation decide in
favor of the latter.

They will be standing in as good order as they are at this writing,
long after the former has faded away from off its canvas.

Many fine groups of mammals were by the National Museum sent on
to the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago to form a part of the
Smithsonian exhibit. Most of these were as fine things of the kind as
have ever been seen in this country, and the writer of this report en-
joyed the unusual privilege of seeing many of these in the course of
their mounting. This was accomplished by a corps of skillful work-
men, including such men as Mr. Joseph Palmer, William Palmer, George
Marshall, and others, the whole being under the direction of Mr. F. W.
True, curator of mammals.

it would be quite out of the question to even enumerate, not to say
describe, all of the groups or single pieces of mammals that now enrich
the collections of the U. S. National Museum. We can at the best put
in a word here and there about the most notable of them and the good
or bad points they offer us. Among those as yet unnoticed is the fine
case containing the three specimens of Ovibos moschatus, the musk oxen,
and I have heard various criticisms in regard to the forms that were
bestowed upon those animals by the taxidermist who preserved them.
Never having seen the animal alive, I hardly feel competent to judge in
the matter, but that the group is a most pleasing one there can be no
question. They are represented standing upon barren rock which has
recently been overlain by a light fallof snow. This last has been admi-
rably rendered by a composition compounded of starch, the pulp of white
blotting paper, and plaster-of-Paris—an invention of Mr. Joseph Pal-
mer’s that has produced a very realistic effect.

Perhaps the best mounted specimen of a Musk Ox now extant is the
one in the possession of EK. V. Skinner, esq., of the Canadian Pacific

tailroad Company, and valued at*$2,500.

Mr. Frederic 8. Webster published an account of this animal in
Forest and Stream, of New York, in its issue of January 26, 1893, and
gave a figure of the Ox. Through the kindness of Mr. Skinner for the
waiving of copyright and loan of the electro of that figure we are -
enabled to reproduce it here in Plate Lxxx. Mr. Webster’s article in
Forest and Stream was entitled “ An Arctic Rover,” and ran as fol-
lows:

The musk ox (Ovibos moschatus) is considered by naturalists one of the rarest of

our North American mammalia. In aclime of almost perpetual winter, within the
Aretice Cirele, this animal lives and thrives. In a land which has been so faseina-

as

ting and so fatal to the many explorers who have sought to solve the mysteries of
424 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

these desolate rocky ice-bound fields, in which no animal, it would seem, could
exist, the hardy musk ox roams at will during the entire year. The ability to
stand the rigors of such a climate is a striking feature of its interesting life history.

The musk ox is at present found only in the most northern parts of North America,
where it ranges in small bands on the barren grounds between the sixtieth parallel
and the shores of the Arctic Sea. Its southern range is gradually contracting, and
it is no longer met with west of the Mackenzie River. It is found through the
Parry Islands and Grinnell Land to North Greenland, reaching on the west coast as
far south as Mellvile Bay. It was met with by all the polar exploring expeditions,
including the De Long, Hall, and Greely parties. Lieut. R. E. Peary in his late
Greenland journey secured several specimens of various ages, and reports it com-
paratively abundant. The German polar expedition of 1869-70 found it at Sabine
Island on the east coast. In former times the musk ox roamed in other parts of the
world. Its fossil remains, or those of an allied species, have been found in northern
Siberia and the plains of Germany and France. It has also been found in the gravel
beds in several parts of England, as Bromley, Bath, and Freshfield, and also in the
brick earth of the Thames Valley at Crayford, Kent.

In size the musk ox equals the smaller varieties of Scotch and Welsh cattle, but
in structure and habits it is more like the sheep; and the combination of character-°
istics is well expressed by its generic name, Ovibos. It is gregarious in habit, going
in herds of 20 or 30 head, and sometimes 90 or 100 have been observed. The bands
contain one or two full-grown bulls. Notwithstanding their short legs, they run
with considerable speed. When frightened, they gather together like a flock of
sheep, and follow a leader as sheep do an old ram. This habit makes the total
extermination of a herd an easy task, when it is the desire of its destroyers to
accomplish it. When thoroughly alarmed they easily ascend precipitous slopes,
their curved, sharp-edged hoofs greatly aiding them in gaining a foothold.

The name of musk ox is given on account of the musky odor exhaled by the ani-
mal. The odor does not proceed from any special gland, as in the case of the musk
deer and other animals which secrete a musky odor. The cause of this peculiar odor
has not been satisfactorily explained.

Aceording to Sir John Richardson, ‘‘ when the animal is fat its flesh is well tasted
and resembles that of caribou, but has a coarser grain.” According to other author-
ities the flesh of the bulls is highly flavored, and both bulls and cows, when lean,
smell strongly of musk. This odor does not seem to be confined to either sex, or to
any particular season of the year. At times the flesh of some of the animals is said
to be tender and very well flavored.

The carcass of a good-sized male will weigh 300 to 350 pounds. In summer they
accumulate considerable fat, and during winter use up this fatty tissue. The males
are considerably larger than the females. The cows calve about June 1, giving
birth to one young one. The animal is also known as musk buffalo and musk sheep,
both very expressive names.

The animal has a very prominent tendency to a hump. The dorsal processes of
the vertebral column, as shown in the skeleton, indicate this. The dense, long, and
somewhat stiff bunch of hair over the shoulders plainly proves that the animal pos-
sesses a hump. All specimens which have been heretofore mounted do not show this
feature of the animal. The head is large and broad. The horns in the old males
are extremely broad at the base, meeting in the median line and covering the whole
top of the head. They are directed, at first, slightly outward, and then suddenly
downward by the side of the head, and then they turn upward with a graceful curve,
and forward, ending in the same plane as the eye. The horns at the base are rough,
but gradually grow smooth from the center to the tips, which are reund, glossy, and
black. At the base they are a dull white. The horns of the females are much
smaller, and at their base the space between them is much broader in the middle of
the forehead. The ears are small and are concealed in the hair. The space between
the nostrils and the upper lip is covered with a short, close hair, as in goats and

sheep, and has no trace of the bare ‘‘mufile” of oxen. The general color of the
hair is a rich brown, shading into black. It is long, matted, and rather curly at the
neck and shoulders. On the back and hips the hair is long and straight, on the sides
of the body exceedingly long, so long as to hang below the middle of the legs. In
some specimens which we have measured the .ongest hairs have been 20 inches long.
In the center of the back there is a patch of soiled brownish white, termed the
saddle.

There is a closely-matted short under wool, exceedingly soft and fine of texture,
and so dense that it is impervious to snow and rain. Ou the chest the hair is long
and straight, and hangs down gracefully like fringe. The tail is short and hidden
in the long hair on the hips. On the legs the hair is short, stiff, and without any
underwool. The hoofs are much curved and larger than those of the caribou, which
they resemble in shape, and the eye of a skilled hunter would be taxed to detect the
difference between the tracks of the two species in the snow. ‘The bones of the ani-
mal are very dense; those of the legs have the weight and appearance of ivory.

The food of the musk ox is similar to that of the caribou, and consists of grass at
one season and lichen atanother. The curved hoofs enable the animal to scrape away
the deep snows which cover their scanty food. Their sense of smell is very acute.
The illustration of the musk ox here given represents the character of the animal.
The specimen from which it is taken is the largest in this country or Europe. The
skin of this specimen was obtained by E. V. Skinner, esq., of the Canadian Pacifie
Railroad, and placed in the hands of Messrs. Sowdon and Webster, of 14 East Forty-
second street, this city, who have prepared it, as faithfully represented by the plate.
Through the kindness and by the permission of Mr. Skinner we have the pleasure
of placing before our readers this handsome likeness.

This specimen was sledded by natives over 1,400 miles near Fort Franklin, and was
received here in fine condition. The order for it was given three years since and
the specimen has been in transit most of this time. The few measurements may
serve to impress the reader with the proportions of this particular specimen. The
animal stands at the shoulder 4 feet 5 inches; the length from nose to stern is 6 feet
7 inches; height at the rump, 3 feet 10 inches; length of head from base of skull to
end of nose, 24 inches; length of horn from median line, following the outside curve
to tip, 24 inches; width of both horns at base, 12 inches; diameter of horns at base,
94 inches; breadth of muzzle, 42 inches; circumference of muzzle, 14 inches; cir-
cumference of hoof of front leg, 17 inches; circumference of hoof of hind leg, 13
inches.

There are but four other mounted specimens of the musk ox in this country. One
is at Harvard College, Cambridge, Mass., and three compose a group at the U.S.
National Museum, Washington, D.C. Of these, one is a male, one a female, and one
a two-year-old, none of them superior specimens.

Among themounted species of the Hquide at the National Museum none
can, in my estimation, in any way approach the specimen of Burchell’s
zebra (Plate LXxxi). The animal has been given an attitude indicative
of moderate movement, with the evident idea in its mind of making an
attack or standing at bay, in which he will use his teeth to bite—a
habit so familiar to us in some cases of vicious horses. The short mane
is semierect, the ears are thrown. back, the eye looks the owner’s intent,
while the quivering and nearly rigid lips drawn apart show the glisten-
ing upper “ nippers” and the crowns of the lower ones; the nostrils are
somewhat closed by the elevation of the superior lip; finally, the entire
rendering of the whole animal is most perfect in all particulars. I am
enabled to present herewith the left lateral view of the head of this
zebra, so its excellence may be the better appreciated.
426 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

But the climax of the taxidermist’s ambition is reached when he can
mount a hairless mammal, large or small, that is at once a perfect
reproduction of the original, and will keep indefinitely uninjured by
the ordinary ravages of time and pests. Of this kind of work the
Museum has several notabie examples, and none of these can exceed in
beauty of design, and consummate skill and knowledge in workmanship
thenow famous African elephant ‘* Mungo” (Plate LXxxxi1). Chief among
the factors of suecess. in mounting an animal of this kind is the fact
that the skin is laid over a thick coat of clay, which latter overspreads
the manikin. Through this ingenious device, after the skin is on and
_the taxidermist essays to model the form to copy the live animal in
every particular, it is seen that all the depressions, wrinkles, lines, and
pits, and protuberances can be exactly reproduced by the proper sim-
ple instruments by working them on the skin through the agency of
the yielding clay beneath it. Ll have compared most critically this

specimen * Mungo” with photographs of living elephants in my collee-
I g gra} g

tion, and find that in each and every particular it is anatomically cor-
rect, and that the attitude is most perfect. Another piece which shows
equally well the master hand is the specimen of the hairless Mexican
terrier (Plate xc). This dog had no hair at all apparently, and his
skin was as thin as ordinary writing paper, but through the aid of a
plaster cast of his entire body as a model and the use of the clay-
covered manikin, a most remarkably fine thing has been produced.
This specimen has also been delicately tinted where it became necessary,
and as now preserved wiil last without change for an indefinite length
of years. Hornaday mounted both ‘“ Mungo” and this terrier. The first
received the silver specialty medal awarded ‘“ for the best piece in entire
exhibition” at the New York exhibition of the Society of American
Taxidermists in 1883, which prize was nearly wrested from it -by the
judges and given to the terrier, which had been entered in competition
against it. This process of using clay has also been employed by its
introducer in mounting the bison, polar bear, Burehell’s zebra, the
tiger, and the puma, figures of each of which illustrate this paper and
are the work of the same illustrious taxidermist.

Speaking of comparing *“* Mungo” with photographs of living ele-

phants brings up the use of the camera again as applied to mammals.
Now, I entirely dissent from Mr. Hornaday’s opinion as to the necessity
of taking photographs of all the mammals we can. Tf believe in photo-
eraphing them in all positions, every possible species, wild and domes-
ticated, living and dead. In his Taxidermy (pp. 21, 22) he remarks:

To the taxidermist and collector, photographs of dead animals are of very little
value, unless it be a large picture of the head of a large specimen, such as a
moose, but that photographs vf live animals, taken ‘broadside on,” as the sailors
say, are extremely valuable aids in mounting; but these you get only in the zodlog-
ical gardens. I never took a camera into the field with me, and have always been
glad of it, for it would not have repaid the trouble it would have involved.

When a person writes in such a strain as this I am convinced he has
not made himself master of the instrument, and knows but very little
about its capabilities. Why, even my very earliest attempts in this
line, in the photography of living and dead mammals in the field, I still
claim are of some use, while others of them are highly suggestive. Take
the Cynomys or Prairie dog, shown in Plate LXxx11, Figs. 1 and 2. I
made that photograph while the animal stood at the very entrance of his
burrow. It was in New Mexico. The relative position of the eye, the
ear, and the nose are well shown in Fig. 1, while the prominent cheeks
are clearly defined in Fig. 2. Whoever it was that mounted the group
of these animals at the National Museum I do not now just remember. It
may have been Mr. Hornaday, but whoever it was he did not appreet-
ate this prominence of the cheeks in Cynomys, and I must believe that
such a figure as here given would have enlightened him on the subject.

There is another structure that I have noticed that is rarely well
preserved, and that is the ears of large hares. These appendages, as
I have studied them in most museum specimens of Lepus, always to me
appear to be more or less shrunken. This especially applies to the ears
of the American Jackass Rabbits (Plate LXXXxIv), and the proper preser-
vation of the form, size, and coloration of these is, of course, very impor-
tant. All these particulars are well shown in the plate, although it is
only a dead animal, it being a photograph I made of one of those hares
immediately after I shot it. Another example of the kind is seen in my
photograph of a dead Badger (Plate LXxxxvi11). The attitude here shown
corresponds exactly with one which, among others, it assumes while in
the act of burrowing, and many a person whom I have shown this
picture has been deceived by it to the extent of mistaking it for a live
specimen. It gives a first-rate idea of the form of the badger’s head,
position of ears, ete. Hada full series of even such photographs as
these been available, or had it been possible for the explorers in foreign
climes to have taken with them one of the many highly convenient forms
of cameras now manufactured, and used it intelligently, I am quite
confident that, had the older taxidermists the ability to avail themselves
of the pictures obtained in this way, we should not have had so many
abominable things to look at in the cases of our museums, and be told
on the labels that this represented that animal, and that this, and so
on. Things, for example, like the fying lemur, shown in Plate LXXVII.
Horrid is not the name for such work as it represents, and it is a pity
that that taxidermist did not have a good photograph of the head of a
Galeopithecus, living or dead, when he started in on the specimen.
Apart from the head, we see feet that seize nothing, shriveled ears,
protruding wires, distorted form—and those eyes!

There is still another class of cases wherein the camera can be made
to do great service, and this is where we meet with an animal given to
building for its home a large and cumbersome nest, such as is seen in
the Veotoma group in the collection. With the enterprise now exhibited
A428 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

upon the part of museum collectors and taxidermists, the feat of trans-
porting such a structure from the wilds of the Soak to the mammal
hall of the National Museum would be considered perfectly feasible.
But before disturbing such a nest in any way where the rats had orig-
inally built it, it would most assuredly be the thing to do to make a
good photograph of it, so that, in the event of having to restore or
arrange parts of it after its transportation and arrival, we would have
the photograph as a model, and the best that could be procured.  In-
deed, with the material at hand the entire nest could be again rebuilt
by it, as for the matter of that.

From the standpoint of the introduction of groups of mammals,
illustrating habits, etc., such a nest as this presents the problem of
devoting a large piece of valuable space to a very small animal. But
we contend here, most emphatically, that the lesson it teaches is fully
worthy of it, and these are the very kinds of objects that we should
devote our very best pains to introduce, with a strict fidelity to nature,
into our zodlogicai museums. I would go farther; I would go to the
extent of giving many square feet of museum space, and faithfully
illustrate in the very best possible manner, a group of beavers and the
dam they build. These animals are now being rapidly exterminated
in our country, and ere they are gone entirely it is surely our bounden
duty to entertain such an idea with the view of carrying it out. Typ-
ical beaver dams are quite as scarce as the builders of them, but one
should be sought at an early date, photographed from various points
of view, and, cost what it may, reproduced at the National Museum.

Few, at the best, realize how rapidly many of our mammals in this
country are being forever’ swept away.. We are fortunate at the
National Museum in having preserved, in the very best manner, a nuim-
ber of them, but there yet remain a great many more demanding our
attention, and, in some cases, our immediate attention. It is the Goy-
ernment’s first duty to see to this matter, and Government aid should
not be withheld for a moment where such enterprises are on foot, but
should, on the contrary, not only propose them, but encourage the under-
taking in every possible way. I have always entertained the idea that
the education of the people of any country is one of the best, if not
the best investment that that country can make, and: surely none of
us will question but what zodlogical and other museums are great
educators. We stand very much in need of a zodlogical museum in
connection with our other Government museums, one large building
devoted exclusively to everything in the animal series below man.
We have no such building at present. We have been very generous
to ourselves in these matters on a number of occasions in the past, but
the income from it has well repaid us each time, and the benefit there-
from as a whole is simply incalculable. The time is near at hand again
when we should think of repeating one of those wise acts, one of those
well-put investments.

SCIENTIFIC TAXIDERMY FOR MUSEUMS. 429

There is another, and now exceedingly rare animal, it being on the
very verge of extinction, which our museum is exceptionably fortunate
in obtaining a specimen, before the destructive and thoughtless hand of
man eliminated it entirely. I refer tothe walrus. This animal’s status
is now pretty well known to the reading public, through the publications
of the National Museum, those of Mr. H. W. Elliot, of William Palmer,
and the daily press incidentally to the general question of the seal-fish-
ery problem. The Museum walrus was mounted in the light of all the
improvements and skill modern taxidermy could bring to bear upon
the undertaking, and the success was complete. It constituted when
finished one of the grandest subjects the Smithsonian sent on to the
Government exhibit at the Columbian Exposition, where at the pres-
ent writing itis. On Plates LxxxvI, Figs. 1 and 2, and Lxxxvii Iam
permitted to give a series of figures from photographs taken at various
times during the preservation of this colossal mammal. These so
clearly represent what I intend they should that special explanation of
any one of them becomes unnecessary. The series are destined to be
illustrations of the very highest interest for ages to come, and ere
another century rolls by, people will regard them with wonder, and
that men actually preserved such a brute, in the flesh, will read far
more like fiction than a reality. At a far remote period it will be
classed with such ideal scenes as prehistoric man engaged in slaying a
mammoth or rudely carving upon the tusks of one.

Some of the seals and other marine mammals in the Museum are very
fine in every particular, while, on the other hand, some of them sadly
need reduplicating, as they, too, are soon to be exterminated. This
applies also to the bears, of which there are some very handsome repre-
sentatives, but none more so than the Polar Bear (Plate LXxxv), of
which there is not a finer mounted specimen in the world. He is rep-
resented as walking up an ice floe at a slight incline, and from the free
upper margins of which hang many icicles. Ice is often wonderfully
well counterfeited by using a moderate coat of paraffin over sheet glass,
or even wood, and we gain the proper effect through its transparency.
The icicles are of glass, of course, and made especially for the purpose,
while the tout ensemble of the effect is perfect.

When another commodious zodlogical building is added to the pres-
ent group of Government institutions, I am of the opinion that the
correct idea is to not only show groups of animals composed of one
species, but to a certain extent faunal groups, wherein can be worked
with the greatest advantage many other natural productions of the
country where the animals occur, as plants, topography, ete. Now
these large groups, if arranged round the wall space, with a varying
depth of 5 to 25 feet, may in some cases be made to advantageously
merge into each other—that is, toa certain extent, show regional groups
and their mergences. For instance, one large case might be con-

430 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1392.

structed to represent an arctic realm, carried down in the foreground
and to one side to the seashore, and upon another rocks, glacial ice,
sheet ice, and what not, as representing the higher land. Then the
foreground should be merged with the background by a skillful artist,
so as to carry with it great depth, and offer the opportunity to show
peculiarities of a sky perhaps, and the effect of distance, as well as to
add other accessories, as a distant shore covered with seals, or, higher
up, a herd of caribou. Such acase could be made to. contain an entire
marine mammalian fauna, and be made far more instructive and impos-
ing than single speciinens uncomfortably huddied or scattered through
the various cases, absolutely ignoring any zodlogical arrangement.

We have the power and the understanding now to carry out such
bold designs, and it is high time that we were about it. The whole
tendency is in just such directions, and all it requires is skillful hand-
ling. What an object lesson or lessons such groups would be, and this
broad and deep country of owrs, ineluding every kind of a fauna and
flora from.Alaska to Florida, thriving in every variety of climate,
includes the very series of zones, realms, and areas that should by just
such means be illustrated. It would represent ideas and groups of
ideas, and ideas are what we want. It would powerfully illustrate
literature as the biologist now makes it for us, and in an orderly man-
ner show our people what we mean by faunal areas, Arctic realms,
geographical ranges, variations of animals under varying conditions of
altitude, desert areas, and shore lines. Museums, among other things,
are made to educate the people of a nation; but a favored few of the
people can study such things in nature. So it is the business of the
museum to bring whole living sections of nature within its walls, where
it can be studied and where books and labels are displayed in abun-
dance to help show how it ought to be studied.

When we can make such animals and groups of animals as those
shown in Plates LXXXIX, or LXXIX, or LXXXIJ, there can be no question in
the world but what the more extensive groups can be combined with
more telling effect. But to be successful in the highest sense of the
word there must be no cheap designers, cheap modelers, cheap artists,
or cheap anything employed; all must be of the very best that the
United States affords—and we have it in both talent and material.
Kspecially for the painted backgrounds should an artist of the very
highest ability be employed, wit'. a staff of others to assist in the intro-
duction of distant animals, forests, or marine effects. If refinement,
knowledge, science, and art are wholesomely combined in such efforts
there is not one bit of danger of either producing a cheap museum
effect, much less anything that savors of the scenery of the theatrical
stage. In one sense it would be far more economical, in the same pro-
portion that it is far more so to make one large case of animals than it
is to build up six or eight small ones.

Then the space throughout the Museum halls, apart from the regional

groups occupying the walls, could be advantageously devoted to cases
of the smaller species groups, single pieces, and other specimens.

Coming to the Felide in the collection of the Museum we find it repre-
sented by specimens similar to those in the other groups, in other words
by the good, by the bad, and by the indifferent, and these are the most
undoubted examples of every genus of this provisional classification.
We see a specimen of. the last-mentioned kind in the lynx shown in
Plate xc, wherein faults about the mouth, slightly wrinkled ears, and
some minor points debar it from the category of the best specimens of
taxidermy. While on the other hand the grand specimen of a tiger,
the head and fore part of whichis given in Plate xc1, has not its peer for
that species in any public museum in the United States. The Puma
is also another admirable preserved specimen of this group.

Of this group Hornaday has said that the “large Felidae (tiger, lion,
leopard, etc.) are the finest subjects for the taxidermist that the whole
animal kingdom can produce. They offer the finest opportunities
for the development of muscular anatomy, and the expression of the
various higher passions.” (Taxidermy, p.171.) This may be very true,
but in my opinion the pieces left by this talented artist to commemorate
his name after his connection with the Museum was severed, and the
ones which will most surely pass his name down into history as a most
masterly taxidermist of his time, are the group of American bison, and
“Mungo” the African elephant, though his Bengal tiger, to gain a sim-
ilar place, be stepping in the very footprints of the latter as he leaves
them.

One who has not seen the feat performed in one of our larger museums
can have but little conception of the skill required in handling the
facial expression and all the structures that enter into thé mouth parts.
The skinning of a tiger’s tongue and preserving it so as to make that
organ resemble the original as it appeared in the living subject; ihe
cleaning of the teeth; the blending of the black part of the lips with
the delicate pink gums inside; to make the animal grin and not smile,
and to lend to the eyes the flash of anger, are all accomplishments that
demand of the artist his best judgment, knowledge, skill, and, what is
more, his infinite patience.

I agree with him when he says:

Some of the old-fashioned taxidermists have the habit of smearing a lot of nasty
lampblack in the eyes of every mounted mammal [and a variety of birds, too], for
what purpose no one knows, but possibly in imitation of actresses, some of whom
have the same unaccountable trick, and a*hideous one in its results in both eases.
There is only one point in its favor: it is the easiest way in the world to give an
animal a black eye. (Jbid., pp. 177, 178.)

Many groups of monkeys and the higher apes now adorn the cases
in the mammal department of the U.S. National Museum. Some of
these are among the best groups of the kind in the hands of the insti-
tution. Among them is the now famous group of Orang-utans, too
432 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

well known to require description in this place; and there are others of
equal beauty and interest. :

Of recent years a great deal of well-directed energy and skill has
been brought to bear to reproduce various races of men, and these
attired in their native costumes and represented in the pursuit of
various employments. They are, as arule, the size of life, and so real
in the majority of instances as to excite the wonder and admiration of
all who chance to behold them for the first time. But this subject has
been found too extensive to handle in the present connection, and it
will no doubt furnish the material for another writer at some time in
the near future. If ever the Museum indulge in the mounting of such
groups, the propriety of which seems to be questionable, as Jules Ver-
reaux’s “Arab courier attacked by lions,” or John Wallace’s famous
“Horseman attacked by tigers,” and similar efforts, why this would
appear to be the more proper place for them, rather than any depart-
ment of zodlogy. If not showing too much or great activity, or other:
wise not too sensational, some such compositions are quite instructive,
and to the public always interesting.

So far as I am aware at present, the Museum ‘has never undertaken
to preserve man, by any other process than the ones now employed, of
clothed manikins, the faces and heads being obtained by casts or other
means. That the direct preservation of man’s body intact has been
elsewhere attempted, however, there can be no doubt, and with some
measure. of success; On page 14 of Capt. Brown’s little work on
taxidermy, I read:

Numerous have been the attempts of mankind to preserve the skin of their fellow-
creatures. The very best of these have been most disgusting deformities, and so
totally unlike the “ human form divine” that none of them have found a place in
collections, with the exception of some parts of man, which form part of the Euro-
pean anatomical collections. In the museum of the Jardin du Roi, at Paris, there is
one ot the best things of this kind which we have seen, a human head injected and pre-
served in spirits of turpentine. This curious preparation was the production of Rintch,
a Dutch physician, highly celebrated for his pathological skill. The precise manner
this interesting preparation was originally preserved is not known. However, it
retains to the present day, all the original and natural colors. In winter, the cold
affects the spirit so much, in which it is preserved, that the head can not be distin-
guished, until the return of warm weather, which dispels its cloudy appearance. The
New Zealanders have a method of drying and preserving the heads of their chiefs,
with the flesh entire. Many of these are to be found in museums; but they are of
little use, and by no means calculated to produce pleasurable sensations.

We may safely predict that no method will ever be discovered, by which man can
be preserved so as to be fit for placing in a museum. (1870. )

Could Capt. Brown but see the host of thoroughly lifelike Indians,
Africans, Japanese, Sainoan, Aino, Esquimau, and Caucasian figures,
of all ages, and both sexes, that Prof. O. T. Mason now marshals in his
department, he could have but one opinion about it, and that is that
the necessity therefor had gone by.

As I closed upon a former page of this paper what I had to say
about the taxidermy of birds, I passed a few brief remarks upon the

hallin which their cases were exhibited. In this particular the mam-
mal department is far better off. It being in the National Museum
building proper, a comparatively more modern structure, it is both
well lighted and well ventilated. The casings are of the most recent
improved kinds, and set off their subjects very satisfactorily. An
object of great interest, and suspended from the roof, is the vertical
mid-section of a hollow papier maché whale, into which has been
placed a skeleton of the same species in situ. It renders a fine idea of
the position of the osseous framework of this huge marine mammal,

CONCLUSIONS.

In writing out the account of my observations and in giving my opin-
ions for this report on the present status of the art of taxidermy, and
what may be hoped for it in the future, I have been very largely influ-
enced by what I have seen and been enabled to study in the collections
of the U.S. National Museum and Smithsonian Institution at Wash-
ington, D.C. When my labors were first undertaken it was the inten-
tion to incorporate herein descriptions of methods and work, with the
appropriate plates illustrating it, of many other museums, both here
and in Europe. In some few instances this has been accomplished, while
from one reason or another it has failed in others. Often institutions
oft the kind we speak are more or less sensitive on the point of submit-
ting their work for an impartial criticism, and so withheld it; while in
others such a very large proportion of the work was so far below the
standard of what taxidermy ought to be in these days, that for very
obvious reasons it has been placed aside without notice. Looking
broadly over the field and taking the subject as a whole, | am of the
opinion that there is, even in many of our first-class museums, very
wide room for improvement in such matters. My aim has been through-
out this entire paper to accord full praise where it appeared to be justly
merited, and in those cases where the work was below what it ought
to be I have endeavored to keep myself above mere fault-finding by
simply indicating the only too apparent errors. We are to be congrat-
wated that the art is making such very satisfactory progress among
us, and that at the present writing, in our most advanced institutions,
Government and otherwise, there is to be found so much to be praised
and recommended and so little to be condemned.

Much might be said here on the subject of suitable museums for the
exhibition of scientific collections of preserved animals, but this phase
of the question will be, as has been said, dealt with in another place.
Be it enough to say here in passing that our Government museums
are as yet very faulty in this particular and far behind some of the
better institutions in, for example, England and elsewhere. The old
ornithological hall in the Smithsonian building is already crowded to
overflowing, and is at the best but illy suited for the purpose, a large

H. Mis. 124, pt. 2——28
A34 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

proportion of the recesses being so very dark that the specimens can
not be properly seen, much less studied. The National Museum build-
ing is better fitted for the exhibition of ethnological and other material
than it is for zodlogical. We stand in need, very much in need, of
a scientifically constructed zodlogical museum, for, in the first place,
to properly exhibit the superb collections that have within compara-
tively recent times grown up here, and, second, to relieve the buildings
already in use. As the British Museum threw off its South Kensington
Department of Natural History, so has, and from like causes, the time
come for us to make a similar step.

Thave called attention to the fact that taxidermists should be thor-
oughly educated men, fully trained in all the technique of their art in
its broadest sense, as pointed out in the body of the paper; that with
respect to the art itself, the main factors of success to be observed are
the using of every means at our command to reproduce nature in
every particular, not only in the case of the specimens themselves, but
in the accessories used in connection with them; that they should be so
prepared as to resist in every way the ravages of time, or the attacks
of pests; that they should, in addition, not only show the appearance
of the animal itself, but aim to give a chapter in its life history, drawing
therefor either upon its habits or its habitat; that everything that in
any way whatever partaking of the grotesque or fanciful or extravagant
innovations should be promptly and forever discountenanced.

My studies have led me to believe that the art of taxidermy has had
a singular evolutionary growth peculiarly its own, the various phases
of which have, in one place or another, been pointed out in the forego-
ing pages, and that of recent years the strong tendency in our leading
museums has been to group animals, and for a variety of purposes. I
am convineed that in the future museums will carry this idea still fur-
ther, and that these groups will. be so combined as not only to exhibit
single species, showing some of their habits and surrounding in their
natural haunts, but also to a very large extent to show faunal regions,
and the animaland plant life of various geographical areas. When thus
presented in the museums of large cities, and showing in that way the
distribution of the animal and plant life of the region wherein the par-
ticular city may be situated, or for the country at large in our Govern-
ment museums, the ever-present lesson they will present for study to
the thousands of men, women, and children who may see such an exhi-
bition during the course of a year will in its practicable value be sim-
ply beyond all calculation. By such arrangements the eye will be
enabled to take in and the mind appreciate the aspect and the biologic
forms of any particular region of the United States almost at a glance.

For the sake of economy, both for the present and the future, we should
employ only the very best materials in our work, and, what is quite as
important, secure the services of only.the most skillful and advanced
artists in the country. Not mere plodders for pay, but men thoroughly
SCIENTIFIC TAXIDERMY FOR MUSEUMS. 435

in love with their work and possessing talents fully capable of improve-
ment and desirous of seizing upon each and every advance made in
the art. To this end, whenever proper opportunity offers, facilities to
Antform themselves in all that directly relates to their work should be
extended to them.

In closing, | but acquit myself of a duty and a pleasure at once
when I extend my thanks to Prof. G. Brown Goode, long in charge
of the National Museum, not only for the advantages that have come
to me in the way of studying the material for this paper but for the
pleasure it has been for ne to write it, and for the many courtesies I
have received at his hands.

To Mr. F. W. True I am especially indebted for the assistance hehas
so freely given me upon every occasion. As the curator-in-charge of
the Museum. it has lain within his power to further my iabors in numer-
ous ways, and this throughout has been done with such marked kind-
ness, promptitude, and cheerfulness that I find it difficult for me to ex-
press to him the gratitude I experience for it and so thoroughly feel.

My own work will have been amply repaid if it result in the further
encouragement and stimulation of the progress of the art of taxidermy,
now so firmly placed on foot in so many quarters of the civilized world.

APPENDIX.

After the manuscript of this paper had been completed, and had
been transmitted to the Museum for publication, there were received
for incorporation in it, through the kindness of Dr. J. A. Allen, of the
American Museum of Natural History, New York City, five photo-
graphs for plates, These photographs represent groups in the collee-
tions of the American Museum of Natural History, in which institu-
tion Dr. Allen has charge of the departments of ornithology and mam-
malogy. They came too late to be inserted in the body of this paper,
but owing to their general excellence and interest, and to the great
courtesy of their sender in submitting them, as well as to the trouble
which he had taken to write out their histories, it was decided to have
them engraved and placed together at the end of the paper. The first
of these added plates (Plate xc) represents a group of Pied Ducks
(Camptolaimus labradorius) which were designed and prepared by
Jenness Richardson in 1889 at the American Museum of Natural His-
tory. The birds were mounted by Mr. H. C. Denslow.

The group which is represented in the second plate of this series
(Plate Xc1rI1) is a more or less elaborate piece of work, also designed and
prepared by Mr, Richardson at the American Museum of Natural His-
tory in 1886. It represents very faithfully the side elevation of a bank,
part way down in which a pair of Louisiana water thrushes (Siurus

,
436 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

motacilla) have built their nest. The male and female birds are seen
approaching it, as they leisurely hop along the roots and twigs of
plants which protrude from the side of the bank.

Of all the specimens on exhibition in the collections of the American
Museum, none have a greater attraction for the observer and visitor
there than the admirable series of bird groups, and one of the most
life-like of these is the beautiful subject of the third plate in this series
(Plate xcrv). It represents a pair of robins (Merula migratoria) with
their nest in an apple tree, the latter being in full bloom of early suin-
mer. :

The fourth plate in the supplemental series (Plate xCV) represents a
eroup of opossums (Didelphis virginiana), male, female, and a number
of young ones. In many respects it resembles the similar groups of
these animals which are to be seen in the U. 8S. National Museum, and
which have been described in the body of this paper. The group rep-
resented in this plate was prepared and designed by Mr. Jenness Rich-
ardson at the American Museum of Naturak History in 1891. It is an
especially fine piece of work, and although it does not contain as many
specimens as the National Museum group, it is hardly the less instrue-
tive on that account.

In so far as the larger mammals are concerned, there is probably not
a piece-in the entire collection of the American Museum of Natural
History that can in any particular compare with the superb specimen of
the huge pachyderm shown in Plate xcvi. It is the Indian rhinoceros
“Bombi” (Rhinoceros unicornis L.). This specimen was mounted at the
American Museum of Natural History in 1890 by Mr. Richardson and
his assistants. The data for the work consisted in measurements taken
from the animal when alive, and also from a photograph obtained at
the same time. After having been mounted, it was properly colored
after a living specimen in the Zodlogical Gardens of Philadelphia. It
is probably one of the best mounted specimens of this species in the
United States.

THE SHOFAR—ITS USE AND ORIGIN,*

By Cyrus ADLER, Assistant Curator of Oriental Antiquities.

The modern Jewish synagogue has preserved in its ceremonial, among
other customs, the use of the shofar, translated in the English version
of the Bible “cornet.” Several times during the service on New Year’s
day, or Rosh hashanah, at the conclusion of the Day of Atonement, on
the seventh day of the festival of Tabernacles or Sukkoth, Hosh'ana
Raba, and during the entire month of Ellul, after the recital of the
supplications or Selichoth, the shofar is sounded. Its use on all these
occasions is not general and probably never was, but it still survives in
many places. For the New Year’s service it is the characteristic feature.

The shofar is usually made of a ram’s horn, straightened and _ flat-
tened by heat. All natural horns can be shaped either by heat or by
cooking in oil. tf

The bore of the instrument is a cylindrical tube of very small caliber,
which opens into a kind of bell of parabolic form. ¢

It is not only the solitary ancient musical instrument actually pre-
served in the Mosaic ritual, but is the oldest form of wind instrument
known to be retained in use in the world. §

In the discussion of Wetzstein’s paper, cited below, Prof. Steinthal
pointed out that this was an instrument no doubt used in prehistoric
times.

*TIn the abstract of this paper published in the proceedings of the American Ori-
ental Society, October, 1889, p. CLXX1I, ff., I made the request for the communication
of additional information on the subject, and I have been favored with some valuable
suggestions from the late Prof. Paul de Lagarde, of Géttingen.

tI have recently met a curious survival of the use and manufacture of a musical in-
strument made of natural horn. While walking on Pennsylvania avenue, Washing-
ton, August 22, 1890, I saw a negro boy about 10 years of age with a cow horn in his
hand. He told me that he had cut off the end, shaped the mouthpiece with a hot
poker, and then scraped it with a knife. On being urged, he blewit quite easily. I
endeavored to secure possession of it, but the boy declined to part with his handi-
work.

There seems to be little doubt that it has been continuously used in
the Mosaic service from the time it was established until now. (Hip-
Kins; XIL.)

FORM.

The shape of the instrument varies considerably. The modern ex-
amples are usually flat (Pl. xcvir, Fig. 1). Two Italian specimens of
the seventeenth century preserve the form of the natural horn; the first
of these is in possession of the Rey. Dr. S. Morais, of Philadelphia; it
was procured for him from Venice by Dr. Isaiah Luzzatto, of Padua.
The second Italian specimen (PI. xcvul, Fig. 2) was collected by Dr. H.
Friedenwald, and belongs to the National Museum collect:ons. The

same shape is exhibited in a beautiful example figured by Hipkins

(Pl. xcvint, Fig. 1), preserved in the Great Synagogue, Aldgate, Lon-
don. A number of excellent specimens were brought together at the
Anglo-Jewish Historical Exhibition, held in London in 1887. They are
figured in the accompanying plates and brietly described in the list of
illustrations. Occasionally the instruments contain Hebrew inscriptions.
Such an one, found near Dessau, was exhibited before the Berliner
Gesellschaft fiir Anthropologie, Ethnologie und Urgeschichte, at the
meeting of March 20, 1880, and formed the subject of a valuable paper by
}}.G. Wetzstein (pp. 63-73. See Pl. xevi, Fig. 3). A similarly carved
and inscribed instrument is in possession of a lady in New York (PI. 6,
Fig. 1). The inscription reads: ‘‘ Happy are the people who know the
sound (of the shofar),” and on the reverse, ‘‘In the light of Thy coun-
tenance shall they walk.” The inscription on the Dessau instrument
consists of Isaiah xxvii, 138 (quoted below), and the two blessings
recited by the person who blows the instrument: ‘“ Blessed art Thou,
O Lord, our God, King of the Universe, who has sanctified us with
His commandments and commanded us to hear the sound of the
shofar;” ‘Blessed art Thou, O Lord, our God, King of the Universe,
who has caused us to live, and preserved us, and caused us to reach
this time.” (Wetzstein, p. 65.)

The shofar was not the only natural horn used by the Israelites as a
musical instrument, but no copies or representations of the other instru-
ments have come down to us.

Some commentators are of the opinion that the instrument known in
the Bible by the generic name of qgeren, was also made of ram’s horn,
and was very nearly identical with the shofar, the only difference being
that the latter was more curved than the former. (Engel., p. 24.)

METHOD OF SOUNDING.

The method of sounding the shofar has been handed down by tradi-
tion, though it varies slightly in different communities. Three sounds
are employed: the shortest, or teqi‘a, a broken or interrupted sound,

shebarim, consisting in the tegia, given three times, and terwa, which
is simply a prolongation of the teqia. Terwa gedola, or the great teru‘a,
is merely an exaggeration of the simple sound of that name. 'The Ger-
man Jews sound the teqia gedola or great teqia. (Hipkins, p. xiii.)

The sound is produced by the ejection of a volume of air into the
trumpet through the lips, which act as a reed, pressed against the ori-
fice of the trumpet.

According to Hipkins the embouchure of the shofar is very difficult,
and but three proper tones are usually obtained from it, although in
some instances higher notes can be got. The short rythmie flourishes
are common, with unimportant differences, to both the German and
Portuguese Jews, and consequently date from before their separation.
These flourishes, as used in the ritual, are teqi a CG shebarim© | GC |
GC { Gand terwa COCO | CCCC | CCCO | G usually a tongued vibrato
of the lower note. The gedola is the great teqi a concluding the flourishes
(p. xiii). ‘The notes here given are those usually produced, but from the
empirical formation of the embouchure, and a peculiarity of the player’s
lips, an octave is occasionally produced instead of the normal fifth.” My
own observation has led me to the conclusion that the production of
the octave is quite common. The fundamental, if obtained, is not re-
garded as a true shofar note.

Wetzstein gives the following musical notation.

Teaia. Shebarim. Tera. Teqi‘a gedola.

aa 86a ee eS

According to Mishna Rosh hashana (1v, 9) the order of sounding the
shofar is as follows: the sounds are blown thrice, the time of the dura-
tion of the teqia is equal to that of three teruwas, and that of each terwa
is equal to three disconnected notes.

From this it would appear that the interrupted sound or shebarim
was not known when this Mishna was written. This conclusion, how-
ever, can not be drawn with certainty.

THE SHOFAR IN THE LITURGY.

Portions of the liturgy for New Year’s Day have especial reference
to the sounding of the shofar. First among these is the hymn, Adonai
beqol shofar, by an unknown author: “ With the sound of the, trumpet
will the Lord publish salvation, to assemble the scattered sheep at the
coming (accomplishment) of the vision of salvation. God is exalted with
a triumphal shout.”

“With the sound of the trumpet God causes a voice to be heard
from heaven, on the holy mountain, and on Jerusalem; then shall the
place be established, by Thy right hand shall be restored to its primi-
tive state. God is exalted with a triumphal shout.”
440 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

“ With the sound of the trumpet the Lord will reveal the period and
appointed time, when He will blow the trumpet and go in the whirl-
winds of the south; then shall the wicked kingdom of Edom be de-
stroyed. God is exalted with a triumphal shout.”

“O Lord, with the sound of the trumpet wilt Thou blow upon the
holy mountain; the beautiful dwelling of Zion wilt Thou expand; Mount
Seir shall be rent; the fixed stake shall be plucked up and removed.
God is exalted with a triumphal shout.”

This is followed by a hymn composed of the various passages (to be
discussed later on) in the Bible, in which the use of the shofar is
mentioned. The sounding of the cornet thereupon follows.

The liturgy of the German and Polish Jews contains the ten reasons
for sounding the shofar stated by Saadia Gaon.*

tabbi Saadia observes that God commanded us to sound the cornet
as alluding to the following subjects:

First. Because this day is the beginning of the creation on which
God created the world and thus began to reign over it; and as itis
customary at the coronation of kings to sound the trumpets and cornets
to proclaim the commencement of their reign, we, in like manner, pub-
licly proclaim, by the sound of the cornet, that the Creator is our king,
and thus says David, ** With trumpets and the sound of the cornet
shout ye before the Lord.”

Second. As the New Year is the first of the ten penitential days,
we sound the cornet as a proclamation to admonish all to return and re-
pent, which if they do not, they cannot plead ignorance, as having been
fully informed. Thus also we find earthly kings publish their decrees
that none may plead ignorance thereof. :

Third. To remind us of the law given on Mount Sinai, as it is said,
Exodus Xxtx, 16, ‘and the voice of the cornet was exceedingly loud,”
and that we ought to bind ourselves to the performance thereof, as our
ancestors did, when they said, ‘All that the Lord has said, will we do,
and be obedient.”

Fourth. To remind us of the prophets who are compared to wateh-
men blowing the trumpets as mentioned in Ezekiel xxx1il, 4, ‘* Whoso-
ever heareth the sound of the cornet and taketh not warning, and the
sword cometh and taketh him away, his blood shall be upon his own
head, but he that taketh warning shall save his life.”

Fifth. Toremind us of the destruction of the Holy Temple, and the ter-
rifying alarm of the enemy’s warriors shouting to battle as mentioned
in Jeremiah rv, 19, “because thou hast heard, oh my soul, the sound of
the trumpet, the alarm of war,” and therefore, when we hear the sound
of the cornet, we ought to beseech the Almighty to rebuild the Holy
Temple.

Sixth. To remind us of the binding of Isaaé who willingly submitted
himself to the will of Heaven; thus ought we also willingly submit
even to death itself, for the sanctification of the unity of His holy name.

_ Seventh. That’when we hear the sounding of the cornet we may,
by the dread thereof, be induced to humble ourselves before the Su-
preme Being, for it is the nature of these martial wind instruments to
produce dread and terror. As the prophet Amos observes, “shall a
trumpet be blown in a city and the people not be terrified?”

Eighth. To remind us of the great and awful day of judgment on
which the trumpet is to be sounded as mentioned, Zephaniah 1, 14-16:
“The great day of the Lord is near, it is near and hasteneth much, a
day of the trumpet and of shouting.”

Ninth. To remind us to pray for the time when the outeasts of Is-
rael are to be gathered together, as mentioned, Isaiah xxvut, 13, “and
it shall come to pass in that day, the great trumpet shall be sounded
and those shall come who were perishing in the land of Assyria.”

Tenth. To remind us of the resurrection of the dead and the firm belief
thereof, as the prophet Isaiah saith “ Yea, all ye that inhabit the world,
and that dwell on the earth, when the standard is lifted up on ihe
mountain, ye shall behold when the trumpet is sounded, ye shall hear.”

The Biblical passages relating to the trumpet are again employed in
the additional service or Musaf, which is read on Sabbaths and holi-
days in place of the additional sacrifice commanded for those days.

In Mishna Rosh hashana (tv, 5) minute directions are given as to the
nature of the Biblical passages to be employed.

The order of the blessings is as follows: Aboth (relating to the fore-
fathers), gedushath hashem (relating to the holiness of God), and gebu-
roth (relating to the greatness of God), and joined with them are the
malkiyoth (relating to God as king), and the shofar is not sounded; then
come texts concerning the holiness of the day, after which the shofar
is sounded; then follow the zikronoth (memorials), after which the shofar
is again sounded. Next follow the shofaroth (relating to the shofar),
and the shofar is sounded; he then says abodah (worship), hodwah
(thanksgiving) and birkath kohanim (the priestly blessing). Such is the
opinion of Rabbi Jochanan ben Nourrie; but Rabbi Aqiba objected
saying to him: “If the shofar is not to be sounded after the reading
of the malkiyoth why are they to be mentioned?” But the proper
order is the following: Aboth, geburoth, and qgedushath hashem are said
with which the malkiyoth are to be combined; after which the shofar
is to be sounded, then the zihronoth are to be read, and the shofar
sounded; next shofaroth and the shofar is again sounded; after which
abodah, hodwah and birkath kohanim are said.  Mishna Rosh hashana
(IV, 6) provides that no less than ten texts relative to malkiyoth, zikvo-
noth, and shofaroth must be said.

Part of the Bible lesson of the day consists of a recitation of the
sacrifice of Isaac, and there is a hymn in the service which dwells on
442 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

the incident. It is possible that it was sought to establish a basis for
the sacredness of the Ram’s horn from the fact that it was a ram or
’ayil which was caught in the thickets by its horns and which served
as an offering instead of Isaac. In Talmud Rosh hashana we read
‘““Ye shall blow before me with a shofar of a ram, in order that ye may
be reminded of the sacrifice of Isaac, the son of Abraham.”

The hymn referred to above contains the acrostic Abbas, Judah,
Samuel: ¢. ¢., Judah ben Samuel ibn Abbas, a poet of the twelfth cen-
tury, who traveled from Spain to the Orient, and afterward became
Rabbi of Fez.*

MISHNIC REGULATIONS.

The Mishna permitted the use of any horn. In Rosh hashana 1,
3, we read: “¢ Every kind of horn may be used because it is a qeren.”
Rabbi Jose remarked, are not all shofars called qeren (horn)? (Joshua
VI, 6.)

The shofar of New Year’s day was usually the straight horn of a
yaal, a kind of antelope or wild goat (chamois), the mouthpiece of
which was covered with gold; while the shofar of fast days was a ram’s
horn whose mouthpiece was covered with silver.

The statute is found in Mishnah Rosh hashana WW, 3: “The
shofar of the New Year was the straight horn. of a yaal, the mouth-
piece of which was covered with gold, and two trumpets were placed
on either side. The sound of the shofar was prolonged and that of the
trumpets made short, because the command of the day is for the shofar;
(Iv) and on fast days crooked ram’s horns were used, whose mouth-
pieces were covered with silver and two trumpets were stationed be-
tween them. The sound of the shofar was made short and that of the
trumpets prolonged, because the command of the day is with reference
to the trumpets (v). The year of the jubilee is like the New Year with
respect to the sounding and the blessings. Rabbi Jehudah, on the con-
trary, says: ‘*On New Year they sound with the horns of rams, and at
the Jubilee with chamois.”

The instrument used in the modern synagoge has no adornments. It
probably represeuts a more ancient form than the instrument described
in the Mishna.

A shofar, which had been broken and joined together could not be
employed, though its use was admissible, if it contained a hole which
had been closed so as not to interfere with the sound.t

In the modern synagogue the shofar is not sounded on New Year's
day when it occurs on the Sabbath. This seems to have been the

* Karpeles, Geschichte der Judischen Literatur, p. 496.

t ‘It is unlawful to use a shofar which had been rent and afterwards joined to-
gether; also one composed of several pieces joined together. If a shofar had a hole
which had been closed, if it hinders the proper sound, it may not be used; but if it
does not affect the proper sound it may be used.”—Mishna Rosh hashana, Ul, 6,

ancient rule after the destruetion of the temple, though it was subject
to some modification.*

Mishna Rosh hashana, tv, provides that some person other than the
reader of the prayers shall sound the shofar.t

BIBLICAL PASSAGES.

We will now proceed to examine the biblical passages with reference
to the shofar. Its use for religious exercise is prefaced by the presence
of its sound at the giving of the law. (Exodus, xrx, 19; xx, 18.)

It is mentioned with other instruments as a fitting announcement of
the new moon. The solemn feasts were similarly announced. New
Year’s day was a “memorial of blowing,” though it will be noticed that
the passages in the Pentateuch which refer to this day, both use the
word “terwah,” or blowing, without expressly mentioning the shofar
itself.

“Speak to the children of Israel as follows: In the seventh month,
on the first day of the inonth, there shall be to youa Sabbath, a memorial
of blowing, a holy convocation” (Lev., xxi, 24), while in another pas-
sage it is simply ealled “a day of blowing” (Numbers, XXIX, 1).

Special feasts or solemn assemblies for particular purposes were
announced by the blowing of the shofar. (Joel, 1, 15.)

The great year of release, which occurred after the enumeration of
seven times seven years, was announced by the sounding of the shofar,
not at the beginning of the year, on New Year’s day, as might be
expected, but ten days thereafter, on the Day of Atonement. (Leviticus,
XXV, 9.)

In Isaiah’s vision of the great day of judgment the shofar is blown

*“ When the feast of the New Year happened on the Sabbath they used to sound
the shofar in the sanctuary, but not out of it. After the destruction of the temple,
Rabban Jochanan, son of Zaccai, ordained that they should sound (on theSabbath) in
every place where there is a tribunal of justice (Leth Din). Rabbi Eleazar says:
“He only issued this order in respect to Jamnia,” but they (the other sages) said
unto him, ‘it was the same for Jamnia as for any other place in which there is a
permanent tribunal of justice.”

“And in this respect also was Jerusalem privileged above Jamnia, viz, that every
city from whence Jerusalem could be seen and the sounding heard, which was near
enough, and to which it was allowed to go on the Sabbath, might sound; but in
Jamnia it was only permitted to sound before the tribunal of justice.—Mishna Rosh
hashana, Iv, 2.

t*It was not permitted for the purpose of sounding the shofar on the feast of
New Year, to go beyond the Sabbatical limits, to remove a heap of stones under
which a shofar is buried, mount a tree, ride on any animal, or swim over the waters
to get a shofar, nor may he cut it with anything that may not be used, on account
of transgression against the Sabbatical rest, nor disobey on its account any nega-
tive precept of the law; but a person may, if he choose, pour water or wine into the
shofar to improve its sound. Children should not be prevented from sounding, but
on the contrary it is lawful to be occupied in teaching them to sound.”—Mishna
Rosh hashana, iv, 8.
444 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

to assemble ‘those who are lost in the land of Asshur and those who
are outcasts in the land of Egypt.” (xxv, 13.)

When David removed the ark to Jerusalem the sound of the shofar
was heard in the procession. (II Samuel, v1, 15; I Chron., xv, 28.)

It is mentioned along with other musical instruments as a proper
accompaniment of psalmody. ‘ Praise Him with the blowing of the sho-
far, praise Him with the psaltry and the harp.” (Ps., CL, 3; ef. also
XCVIII, 6.)

Some years ago I was informed it had been introduced into opera by
an Italian composer, with what success I do not know.

WAR HORN.

The most ancient use of signals of any sort was no doubt to apprise
a tribe of the coming of an enemy and to call together the clansmen for
defense. Possibly the earliest, certainly the most frequent use of the .
shofar in Israel, was for military purposes.

The ancient Egyptians used a trumpet for military purposes, but it
was a long, straight metallic instrument like the Hebrew hagogera.
(Wilkinson, T, 104f.)

The troops seemed to have’ marched to its notes. (1 bid., woodcut
289, and Rawlinson, History of Ancient Egypt, Vol. 1, p. 491.)

The shofar could be heardata great distance. There is an allusion to
its loudness in Isaiah (Lyi, 1): “‘Cry with a full throat, spare not,
like the shofar lift up thy voice, and declare unto my people their
transgression, and to the house of Jacob their sins.”

It played an important part in the imposing demonstration made
before the walls of Jericho. (Joshua, V1, 4, 5, 6, 8,9, 13, 16, 20.)

When Gideon was filled with the spirit of the Lord he assembled
the outlaws who composed his army by blowing the shofar (Judges
vi, 54). Hach man carried one of the instruments and the noise thereof
very materially contributed to the surprise of the Midianite army.
(Judges, V1, 8, 16, 18, 19, 20, 22.)

In the actual narrative itself, the shofar is not as frequently men-
tioned as the constancy of its use for certain purposes might lead us
to expect. The infrequency of its mention is in a way, however, a sort
of evidence of the frequency of its use. The blowing of the bugle is
as regular a part of a charge as the horses on which the cavalry is
mounted. Its picturesqueness would naturally strike the mind of a
poet and so the references to the shofar in the prophetical books are
numerous.

In the following nineteen passages from the prophets, the shofar
symbolizes war:

“Tell ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem, and say, Blow ye the
shofar in the land: call out, gather together, and say, Assemble your-
selves, and let us go into the fortified cities.” (Jeremiah, Iv, 5.)

so that the people be not warned, and the sword cometh, and taketh

ground, and keepeth not quiet when the shofar’s voice (is neard).”
(Job, XXXIX, 24.)

OTHER USES.

From the Talmud we learn that the use of the shofar as a note of
alarm of war was transferred to other seasons of danger and <distress.
Famine, plague of locusts, and drought (Mishna Taanith, 1, 6) occasioned
the blowing of the shofar.

The shofar was employed at the public ceremony of excommunica-
tion.* (Wetzstein, p. 67.)

A very curious use of the shofar in later times was in funeral cere-
monies (Wetzstein, p. 67). I agree with Wetzstein that this use of
the instrument is quite apart from the usual Semitic custom and was
probably borrowed.

As a signal instrument of war it had various uses, possibly accord-
ing to the note that was blown. It was the signal for going out to
battle, for the announcement of a victory, and for a recall of the troops.

It was with the shofar that Ehud assembled the people. ‘And it
came to pass, when he was come, that he blew the shofar on the moun-
tain of Ephraim, and the children of Israel went down with him from
the mountain and he before them.” (Judges, 111, 27.)

“And again there happened to be a worthless man, whose name was
Sheba, the son of Bichri, a Benjamite, and he blew the shofar and
said, ‘We have no partin David, nor have we any inheritance in the
son of Jesse; every man to his tents, O Israel” (IT Samuel, xx, 1.)

Isaiah refers to this use (XVIII, 3):+ “All ye inhabitants of the world,
and dwellers on the earth, when the ensign is lifted upon the moun-
tains, see ye; and when the shofar is blown, hear ye.”

When Jonathan had defeated the Philistines in Geba, “ Saul blew
the shofar throughout all the land, saying, Let the Hebrews hear,”
(I Samuel x11, 3,), and thus become acquainted with the victory.

It announced the end of the struggle between Abner and Joab which
succeeded the death of Saul. (II Samuel, 1, 28.)

Atter the death of Absalom, which really ended the revolt against
David, Joab blew the shofar and the people returned from pursuing
after Israel. (II Samuel, xvurt, 16, cf. also IT Samuel, xx, 22.)

The shofar was employed to announce the coronation of a king.
This may be considered but a feature of its use for military purposes,
since, as some of the passages about to be quoted show, the coronation

“In Sanhedrin, 7 \)., we read: ‘Rab Huna when about to hold court was accustomed
to ask for the implements of his trade: a rod, a strap, a shofar, and a sandal.” The
shofar, remarks Rashi, was for use at an excommunication.

tNakdreh Khaneh, a rock near Bandamir, in Persia, is so called (according to tra-
dition) because at the sound of drums and trumpets the workmen engaged on the
walls and dikes in the neighborhood assembled there to receive their wages and
provision. (Ousely, 1, 186.)
THE SHOFAR. 447

of the king and the announcement of his victory over some other tribe
or faetion were one and the same event.

When Absalom was engaged in the revolt against his father he sent
spies among all the tribes of Israel announcing his intentions and in-
forming them that when they heard the shofar sounded they might say
that he had become king. (II Samuel xv, 10.)

In the directions given with regard to the coronation of Solomon the
use of the shofar is expressly mentioned (I Kings, 1, 34 and 39), and its
sound affrighted Adonijah and guests at their banquet. (I Kings, 1,
41.)

The overthrow of the house of Ahab and the coronation of Jehu
were proclaimed in the same way. (II Kings, Ix, 13.)

ETYMOLOGY.

The etymology of shofar is not at all clear. Gesenius derived it
from the stem shafar “to be bright, clear, beautiful—possibly on ae-
count of its clear sound,” but this is hardly satisfactory. The editors
of the eleventh edition of Gesenius retain the same explanation. *

Nothing can be learned from Arabic sabbir.t This is simply bor-
rowed from the Talmudic form sippira or sippir, the b in Arabic repre-
senting the Hebrew p, as the Arabic possesses no p, but only f.t

The trumpet now used by the Arabs of Asia Minor, which they call
seifur, is a metallic instrument. It is possible, however, that the word
was originally applied by the Arabs to an instrument of horn.§

The Arabian Jews called the shofar saafar. We may, however, get
some light from Assyrian.

According to Stade (Grammar, par. 218a) the Hebrew shofar stands
for a form sappar, and exactly this form has been found in Assyrian.
Tn a cuneiform list of animals (II Rawlinson, v1, 6 cd) we find, following
atudu, “he goat,” the word sapparu, which is accordingly the name of
an animal, possibly of the goat order. The word also occurs in a
“They say parenthetically that the shofar was the shape of a horn and possibly
made of horn.

tWetzstein, p. 73, proposes an Arabic etymology; sufra and safir in Arabic mean
edge or corner, and it is probably his idea that they bear the same relation to shofar
that corner bears to Latin cornu. The late Prof. de Lagarde compared shofar with
Armenian shifora (Armer ische Studien, p. 117, No. 16931).

§See Musical Instruments and their Homes, by Mary E. Brown and William
Adams Brown (New York, 1888), p. 196. It is principally interesting because it
resembles the trumpet played by an Assyrian warrior on a bas-relief of Nineveh and
the Hebrew trumpet represented on the arch of Titus at Rome. This latter is not
identical with the shofar; it is the straight metallic trumpet or hagocera whieh is
represented on the arch of Titus (Engel, p. 24).

bilingual incantation (V Rawlinson, 50, 47-49) describing the action of
‘the disease called asakku. The passage reads: turdha ina qaqqadisu u
qarnisu icgcabit, atuda sappar Sadi sappartasunu igcabit, “the mountain
‘goat by its head and horns it seizes, the he goat, the Sappar of the
mountain, by its Sippartu it seizes.” Here sappartu undoubtedly means
“horn,” being the feminine form used in Semitic to denote lifeless objects
((Gesenius, Grammar, par. 107, 3, a); the conclusion would, therefore, be
that the shofar is so called because it was originally made of the horn
of the species of goat called sappar.* The Hebrew shofar corresponds
to Assyrian sappartu, it being worthy of notice that shofar, although
not possessing the feminine termination in the singular, always makes
a feminine plural.

In the discussion on the Wetzstein paper Mr. Hartmann suggested
that the peculiar shape of the horn given to it artificially was intended
to imitate the shape of the horn of some wild animal, possibly the wild
sheep (Ovis cyprias); not that apprehend that the suggestion is exactly
correct, since, as will be seen, the shape is not uniform. The suggestion,
however, that the horn was not that of a domesticated animal, but of an
animal more difficult to get, seems to have a certain inherent probability.

Wetzstein is of the opinion that the use of the ram’s horn may have
been borrowed by the Israelites and goes back to a people who were
engaged solely in the care of sheep. By these it was used as a signal
of alarm.

SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS.

Various ancient and modern nations have used the horns of animals
for wind instruments. The fellowing specimens are preserved in the
collection of musical instruments in the U.S. National Museum.

At the time of the Festival of the Prophet the Berbers use a horn
which consists of two rams’ horns joined at the ends and provided with
metal mouth-pieces. This instrument is now called zamr. The speci-
men belongs to the National Museum and was collected by Mr. Talcott
Williams.

The Shringa, “an ancient outdoor wind instrument of the horn
species. It is commonly known as the Indian horn. It was the favor-
ite instrument of the Hindu god Siva.” It is a common ox or buffalo
horn of dark color, seraped and polished, the tip cut off and the em-
bouchure enlarged and shaped with a hot iron. It is 124 inches in
length and the diameter varies from five-eighths to 24 inches. In form
it differs in nowise from the shofar. (Pl. xcvu, Fig. 4.)

ean trumpet or war horn made of an elephant’s tusk, the natural cavity

*Baron von Kort’, in the discussion of Wetzstein’s paper, asserted that the goat
horn was still used for making shofars by the Jews of Poland. If this statement be
correct it would point to a tradition more ancient than that contained in the Jewish
liturgy.

The instrument is 20 inches long, the diameter of the bell being 34
inches. There are four other war horns of elephant’s tusks, made in
various parts of Africa, which do not differ in form from the specimens
described above.

The natives of Sumatra use a trumpet made of the horn of a cow.*

The earliest metal trumpets were constructed on the same principle
as the shofar, and in some cases the form of the instrument is plainly
a copy of some natural horn.t

In one of the smaller mounds at Tello, M. de Sarzee discovered a
fragment of a large bronze statue. ‘It was,” he says, “a life-sized
bull’s horn of bronze plating, mounted on a wooden frame, but the
wood was carbonized by the action of fire.”

There is a Siamese engraved copper horn in the U. 8S. National
Museum shaped like a buffalo horn. (PI. xcvir, Fig. 5.) The British
Museum possesses a bronze Etruscan cornu (engraved), constructed on
the same principle (Engel, p.33). Of similar pattern was the tuba.
Both the cornu and the tuba were employed in war to convey signals
(tbid., p. 36).

The Greeks had a curved horn, keras, made of brass, and a straight
horn, salpinx, exclusively used in war (?bid., p. 32). Trumpets are
often mentioned by writers who have recorded the manners and cus-
toms of the Indians at the time of the discovery of America (ibid.,
p. 67). No specimen of such trumpets have so far been discovered
among North American aboriginal remains. A wooden wind instru.
ment is in use among the Carvadoo, an Indian tribe in Brazil. ‘ With
this people it is the custom for the chief to give on his war trumpet
the signal for battle, and to continue blowing as long as he wishes the
battle to last” (ibid., p. 69).

The metallic descendant of the Indian buffalo horn, the shringa, men-

performers usually being Hindus of the lower caste. In the villages
of southern and central India the watchmen blow it at sunset and at
certain hours of the night, like the German nachtwichter. In large
cities a horn-blower is always attached to the police. There is seldom
a guard or detachment of native irregular troops without one. It is
employed in all processions, temple services, marriages, and other
festive occasions, and at funerals.*

Another trumpet of the same class is the kurna, used chiefly in reli-
gious processions, or in festivals in honor of local divinities. Only
Brahmins and persons of a certain rank are permitted to use the kurna.
It is esteemed by all Brahinins to be the most ancient instrument of
music in existence, and the sound of it to be especially pleasing to the
gods in various particular ceremonies and at solemn parts of the sacri-
fices (Cf. Ibid. loc. cit.).

CONCLUSIONS.

In conclusion, the following deductions, which seem to be legitimate,
are drawn, though all are not advanced with equal confidence:

(1) The oldest wind instrument used by inland peoples was the horn
of an animal, witha natural cavity, and a mouthpiece formed by cutting
off the end. Horns which required hollowing came later into use.

(2) These horns were originally used as signals in time of danger
and for making announcements in general.

(3) Many of these important announcements had a religious charac-
ter. The antiquity of the instrument caused its permanent adoption
for sacred purposes.

(4) The shofar, speaking especially of the instrument of that name,
was originally a wind instrument, made of the horn of a wild goat. Its
sacred character may be connected with sacrificial use made of the
goat.

(5) The etymology of the word is to be sought iu the Assyrian sappar,
a species of wild goat; sappartu (the feminine form) meant originally
the horn of the sappar, and it may afterwards have been used for horn
in general.

Tribes dwelling near the sea used shells for the same purpose. Bib-
lical Hebrew possesses two other words for the horn of some special
animal, geren and yobel, which were originally applied to animals. It
is interesting in this connection that Hebrew qeren, Latin cornu, and
English horn are all used both for a wind instrument and for the horn
of an animal.

THE CRUMP BURIAL CAVE.

(BLOUNT COUNTY, ALABAMA.)

By Frank Burns, U. 8. Geological Survey.

This cave was discovered in the summer of 1840, by Mr. James New-
man and some of his friends while hunting. It is located on the
banks of the southern branch of the Warrior River, in Murpheys Val-
ley, Blount county, Alabama, and is in the steep limestone cliffs where
the river entered a gorge and left the valley. The entrance to the
cave was about 400 feet above the stream and 50 feet below the plateau
above. The opening into the cave was so small that a man could
scarcely crawl into it. Procuring lights, the hunters entered the cave.
They found it perfectly dry, the air pleasant and cool, and the rooms
sufficiently large to accommodate the rather large party of young men.
A short distance from the entrance was a room, which proved to be a
“burial cave” of the aborigines. They found eight or ten wooden
coffins of black and white walnut, hollowed or cut out of the solid,
after the fashion of the “dugout” canoe. The coffins were sent to the
Smithsonian Institution, where they have been restored as far as pos-
sible, and are now exhibited in the department of prehistoric anthro-
pology. Eight have been restored, and there are in addition many
parts of coffins. The coffins are about 74 feet long, 14 to 18 inches
wide, 24 inches thick, and 6 or 7 inches deep. They have been hol-
lowed out by fire, aided by stone or copper chisels, or hatchets. Traces
of the use of both implements are to be seen on the inside. The ends
are open, as shown in Fig. 1 of the accompanying plate. (PI. UT.)

In proximity to the coffins were twelve or fifteen human skulls, and
also a large number of human bones. These were scattered around,
showing that there had been disturbance after burial, whether by
beasts of prey or otherwise could not be determined. If there were
bones of other animals, it was not observed or not reported.

’ There were five or six wooden trays—one was secured and sent to the

Smithsonian Institution. It is 18 inches long, 12 inches wide, 14 inches

thick at the bottom, reduced to thin edges at the top, and 3 inches deep.

Also six small wooden bowls, a fragment of one only being secured.

Seattered about, but near the skeletons and coffins, were found the
451
452 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

following objects: About 200 pounds of galena, some of the larger
pieces being rudely grooved, similar to the aboriginal stone axes and
mauls, as though for warclubs—casse-tetes ; a number of arrow and
spear heads and other relics ; a small copper hatchet, a copper chisel
about 5 inches long, and about twenty copper ornaments, most of these
having small holes drilled as though for suspension ; six or seven large
shells (Fulgar earica); some shell disks and beads and pieces of wooden
matting about 6 inches square, made of bark or cane and much decayed.
One of the copper chisels and some of the galena were in one of the
coffins.

The opening of the cave was enlarged, and became a place of some
celebrity, being visited by the citizens, neighbors, guests, etc., who
carried away such things as suited their fancy. The skulls were car-
ried away by doctors, and the beads were appropriated by the children,
while others broke up the galena and carried it away for the purpose
of making bullets.

The cave remained in this condition for twenty or more years. Dur-
ing the war for the suppression of the rebellion, the cave was excava-
ted for saltpeter, and was also a hiding-place for refugees. The coffins
were badly damaged, as is shown by their present condition, but
fortunately were not destroyed. How they could have escaped use as
firewood is scarcely imaginable.

The late Rey. William Crump owned the land on which the cave was
situated, and from whom it takes its name, and his family still owns it.
They had in their possession a few years ago, a number of copper
objects, a few stone implements, and two of the large shells, one of
which was used at the blacksmith shop for pouring water on hot iron.
I made effort to obtain these relics, but failed. They permitted me to
visit the cave and collect the Pas and pieces there, which I hauled
a distance of 30 miles to the railroad, and shipped them to the Na-
tional Museum. I spent some time on different occasions in visiting
this cave and talking to Mr. James Newman and others who discov-
ered the cave, and obtained from them the facts which I have here re-
corded and which I regard in every way as reliable. That the cave

was a very old burial plage is undeniable. :

There is a small mound at the foot of the bluff in the narrow river
bottom, and around it a number of relics have been plowed up, one
of which was a ‘stone wheel” with a groove around it, probably used
as part of a machine for drilling holes in stone and copper.

About five miles north of the Crump Cave, on the mountain of lime-
stone just beneath the overhanging cliff of Millstone Grit, I found and
forwarded to the Museum an Indian ladder which stood against the
precipice and had been used to mount or climb up to what the people
call a “rock house,” 7. é., a large, roomy, dry place under overhanging
cliffs of stone, probably used like the cave, for burial purposes. This
ladder is the trunk of a cedar tree about 8 inches in diameter, is about

14 feet long, has 7 or’8 steps, 15 or 19 inches apart, made by cutting
nto the tree a scarf about 6 inches high and 2 inches deep. Near the
foot of the ladder, but out in the open air, was a rock mound of good
size, from which some relics had been dug by parties hunting for
buried Indian money.

There are many such houses in the coal measures, and they were
used by the aborigines as dwelling or burial places. I have found
human bones, and in one instance some beautiful arrow-heads, in a
number of such places among the mountains. The aborigines would
lay their dead away in rock crevices in wild and retired spots, and
cover them with stones enough to protect them from wild animals and
leave them in the “Eternal Silence.” IL have in some instances sent
the bones to the Museum; in other cases I left them undisturbed. I
have walked many miles for the purpose of making similar investiga-
tions through the country formerly belonging to the Creeks or Musco-
gees, when it was impossible to ride and dangerous even to walk.

In the year 1881 I visited the site of a former Creek Indian village
in Brown’s Valley, Marshall Coumty, Ala. This was a village of
friendly Creeks. They had helped Gen. Jackson in the war against
their countrymen, and after peace was made, he removed and settled
them on lands of the Cherokees until they were sent west of the Mis-
sissippi. The early settlers told me that when one of the Creeks died,
they buried him in a corner of one of the huts or wigwams, which in
this village were small houses made of logs after the manner of the
white settlers, and that when a person was buried in each corner of a
hut, it was pulled down and removed to another spot. I had no means
of verifying this report. In the Cherokee country they buried their
dead in caves in some instances, but generally in the ground, like
Americans.

REMARKS BY Mr. THOMAS WILSoN.—While this method of coffin
burial was unusual, if not unknown in the United States, yet there
were similar burials among the prehistoric peoples of other countries.
In the center of one of the display rooms in the great Prehistoric Mu-
seum at Copenhagen stand two coffins, similar in appearance to those
just described, made of the cloven and hollowed trunk of an oak tree
(Pl. ct, Fig. 2). One came from Treenhoi and the other from Borum-
Kshoi, Denmark. One contained the body of a man; the other that of
a woman. The skeleton of the man had crumbled away; that of the
woman was well preserved. From the remains of the clothing they
have been able to reconstruct the garment of that period (PI. C1,
Fig. 3). The material was wool, which had been closely spun, and
was of the color known in the United States as “butternut”; whether
that was the original color, or whether it had been changed by contact
with the oak coffin, was not determinable. The garments consisted of
a high cap, a wide, roundly cut mantle, a sort of tunic, pieces of
wool which had probably covered the legs, while at the feet were
AD4 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

remains of leather or skin, which had possibly been shoes. The cap
was without a visor, and it and the garment were covered with a pro-
jecting knotted thread, which hung down. The tunic was kept together
with along woolen belt, which went twice around the waist, was knotted
in front, and the two long ends hanging down were decorated with
fringe. At his left side lay a bronze sword in a wooden sheath lined
with skin. At the foot was a round wooden box containing a smaller
box of the same kind, which, in its turn, contained an extra woolen
eap, a horn comb, and a bronze razor. The bodies in both burials were
wrapped in cow-hide. The woman’s coffin contained a bronze fibula, or
safety pin, a bronze dagger with a horn handle, a spiral finger ring,
two bracelets, a torque, and three round and beautifully decorated
bronze belt plates of different sizes, with points projecting in the
middle.

There is in the National Museum a square of the same cloth from
a similar burial, obtained by myself at Frederichsund, a detail of
which, the tiber and mode of weaving, can be seen as shown in Fig. 3
of the plate. In these cases the.coffins were different from those at
Crump’s Burial Cave, the corresponding upper half of the tree trunk
having been hollowed out and serving as a coffin lid.

The London Chronicle (1767) reports the opening of a mound (barrow)
near Wareham, Dorsetshire, wherein was found a human burial in the
hollowed trunk of an oak tree. The bones were wrapped in a covering
of deer skins sewn together. And here was found what was consid-
ered a piece of gold lace wrought into lozenge pattern. (Mrs. Bury
Pallister, History of Jzace, p. 3.)|
MINUTE STONE IMPLEMENTS FROM INDIA.

By Tuomas WILSON, Curator of Prehistoric Anthropology.

The National Museum has become possessed of an extensive series of
minute chipped stone implements from India. They were collected by
Mr. A.C. Carlyle, formerly of the Archeologic Survey, in the Vindhva
hills or mountains in central and north-western India. They were ob-
tained through the assistance of Mr. Charles Seidler, of London. The
series comprises every condition of the implement, from the rude mate-
rial, the nucleus or core, the flake—sometimes rude, often quite symmet-
rical—and so on through the various steps, until is reached the
finished chipped implement of every form. Their peculiarity, differing
from other prehistoric implements, is their remarkably small size. The
cores themselves are rarely more than an inch and three-quarters in
length, and the blades are rarely more than an inch and a quarter or
aniich and a half—the majority of them are not more than an inch, while
the finished specimen is frequently not more than five-eighths of an
inch in length. Needless to say that all these flakes are of extreme
thinness. The finished implements are of various forms—slin, almost
needle-like, triangular, with a base, convex, straight or concave, quad-
rilateral, trapezoid, rhomboidal; while the most delicate and _ finely
finished are in the form of a crescent.

These various shapes are indicated in the figures on the accompanying
plates, and the numbers of each kind belonging to the collection will be
given in the list at the end of this paper. Plate CI represents some of
the implements by photograph. There is a marked difference between
the two edges of the crescents. The crescent edge is thick and has been
worked in to its present shape by the secondary chipping of the most
minute kind, while the straight edge is the cutting edge, sharp and thin,
just as it comes from the nucleus, and is without any secondary chip-
ping. The material comprises all the variety of silicious rock jasper,
chert, horn-stone, flint, agate, and chalcedony; some of them are rare
and fine specimens. They belong to the neolithic period, although they
are something new to its culture. The whole series bears the same im-
press. The similarity of form and mode of manufacture, and their be-
ing found in the same general locality, is evidence showing the same
intention on the part of the makers, although we are quite in the dark

455
AD6 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

as to what that intention was. All varieties of small implements were
found by Mr. Carlyle in the caves and rock-shelters among the Vindhya
hills in places difficult of access and unknown to the ordinary traveler.
Some of them were found in the alluvium at the mouth of the cave,
where they had been washed out and were caught in slight ledges of
the rock, after the fashion of washed gold in the rocking-cradle. Within
the caves they were found in the upper strata, while immediately be-
neath, but separated from them, were larger implements, different in
size, kind, and style, and formed of indurated sandstone, hematite and
chert. Crescent implements were found in grave mounds in the neigh-
borhood of the caves, leading one to suppose that the inhabitants of
the caves who made these implements built the mounds and here
buried their dead. Mr. Carlyle, while agreeing that these implements
belonged to the neolithic period, has found those belonging to the
paleolithic period in the same locality, and believes that the evidence
of the archeology of the district shows, contrary to the opinion held
in regard to Western Europe, that there was no such hiatus between
the paleolithic and neolithic periods, and that the series of implements
run from one period to the other, their difference being accounted for
by the general progress from the lower to the higher civilization. To
this period of transition, Mr. Carlyle has given the name of ‘ mezo-
lithic.”

It is not easy to determine the purpose of these small implements,
especially the crescent, trapezoid, and scalene triangular, which have
neither known prototype nor antetype. Some of the triangular and
long-pointed ones might have served as arrow-heads. If they had been
found on the California coast, they would, without doubt, have been
thus attributed; but they are entirely different from any recognized
arrow-heads in the Western Hemisphere. It has been suggested that
they, or some of their kindred, might have been used for tattooing,
but there is nothing more to favor this than its possibility and our ig-
norance of their real purpose. Some of the smaller and straighter
objects might have served as needles or perforators. A possible use
akin to that of tattooing might have been that of the medicine man
for bleeding or scarifying. One can scarcely understand any use possi-
ble which should have required the infinite number of these implements
or confined them to the one general locality.

There surely is not enough distinctiveness in these implements to
induce the belief that they form a racial distinction.

Mr. Carlyle reports that on the walls of some of the caves at Morahua
Pahir there were rude drawings of men and animals painted in red.
They were of the usual character seen in pictographs of savage races,
and the interest is increased by the fact that in these caves, and associ-
ated with these implements, rude pottery was found, roughly orna-

down and smoothed by pieces of red hematite which had been brought
from the laterite deposits.” There were also grinding stones with which
this hematite might have been ground into a paste, such as would serve
to decorate the walls. These implements have been found by other
travelers—other archeologists, one might say. Mr. Rivett Carnac has
found them in the Panda district and described them in a paper en-
titled “‘Stone Implements from the Northwest Provinces of India,”
Calcutta, 1885. Sir John Evans has also described the discoveries of
worked flints near Jubbalpur; in central India, in Proceedings of the
Society of Antiquaries, second series, Vol. 11. Prof. Haynes, of Boston,
found some in Egypt; Bellucci found them in Tunis; the French army
of occupation found them all along the northern coast. Adrian de
Mortillet describes them in 7 Homme, Vols. 1 and 1, as from central and
southern France. While those from France are similar to these now
under discussion from India, yet it is to be suggested that they are
not in sufficient number to be more than sporadic (Plate crm). Mr.
Merejkowski found some of these in the Crimea near Kizilkoda, and
has described them in his Premier recherche sur Vage de la pierre en
Russie (St. Petersbourg, 1880). Whether these are of types sufficiently
pronounced and are found in sufficient numbers to have relation to the
implements from India, I am unable to say.

COMPARATIVE OOLOGY OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS.

By R. W. SHUFELDT, M. D.

The only object of this paper is to bring together what is already
well known in regard to the odlogy of North American birds, placing
it before the ornithologist in a more condensed form than it is usually
given and in a comparative way. The question of the variation in
the matter of form and coloration of the eggs of the birds of this and
other countries has interested the writer for many years, and in the
light of our present knowledge of the relations existing between birds
and reptiles, both in this age and the past ages of the world, I have
often wondered at what the causes were that eventually brought
about the variation in color and form of which I have just spoken.

So far as the writer is concerned, he is not aware of the discovery of
the eggs of any of the now extinct forms of reptiles, either fossil or
subfossil, and it is beyond all probability that we will ever know what
the eggs of Archwopteryx, or any of the toothed birds of the Kansas
Cretaceous beds (Hesperornis, Ichthyornis, and others), or, indeed, any
of the smaller extinct types of Aves, looked like. We have in our
possession but very little upon this subject. Of the extinct Dinornis
of New Zealand, and of the ponderous _Hpyornis of Madagascar, also
extinct, we have their eggs in a subfossil state, but except in the point
of size they probably did not markedly depart from those of existing
Ostrich types of birds (Struthionide) now living and most nearly
related to them.

Allof the eggs of the common African Ostrich (Struthio camelus) that
I have examined have been of a more or less ellipsoidal form, unitinted,
and with hard, flinty, and externally polished shells.* Their peculiar
mode of incubation is well known and has been faithfully described by
Lichenstein.t During the breeding season a cock Ostrich associates

*North African Ostriches, strange to say, differ remarkably from those of the Cape
of Good Hope birds, in so far as the eggs of the former haye a perfectly smooth,
ivory-like surface, while those of the latter are rough-surfaced and dinted all over
with minute punctures; yet no specific difference seems to obtain between the forms
of the birds themselves from the two localities mentioned.

with four or five hens and the latter all lay their eggs in the same nest
until some thirty are deposited. The male bird incubates during the
night and the hens take turns during the day.

The main facts to bear in mind here are that the eggs average about
30 in number, are ellipsoidal in form, and are unspotted, being a yel-
lowish-white in color, with a hard shell. The South American Ostriches
(Rhea) essentially agree in these characters.* We meet with exceptions,
however, among the Ratite in the Cassowaries and Emus. The mode
of incubation here is much the same as in the Ostriches, but Cassowa-
ries (Casuaride) lay dark-green and rough-shelled eggs, while the
Emus (Dromeide) make a shallow nest in the ground, in which they
lay from 9 to 13 eggs of a bluish-green to a dark bottle-green color;
the period of incubation being eighty days, the cock bird performing
the duty of hatching. Apteryx lays but a single egg two or three times
ayear. Itis enormous for the size of the bird, and is deposited in a
hole in the ground. Authors differ in their opinion as to the question
of incubation. Some hold it is performed by both sexes, while others
contend that it is performed only by the female. The Ratite birds are,
structurally, the most reptilian forms of the class Aves we have in ex-
istence, yet were we to depend upon a study of their methods of ineu-
bation and their eggs it would be but an uncertain clew as to what we
might be led to expect either in the higher groups of carinate birds, or
in existing reptiles, or in extinct forms of either class, or finally, in
lowly organized birds of other groups. We have the main facts, how-
ever, that in the Ratite the eggs may ini number range from one to
many; in color from yellowish-white to a green (never spotted or
streaked, etc.); in form ellipsoidal (always?); and incubated by one or
both of the sexes. Let us look at one or two other peculiar groups of
birds and then pursue the subject in a different direction. In the case
of the Penguins (Jmpennes), they lay two white or greenish-white eggs
in a rude nest on the ground or in a burrow, while, on theother hand,
the Tinamous (Cryptwi) lay eggs which are “remarkable objects, curi-
ously unlike those of other birds. Theirshell looks as if it were of
highly burnished metal or glazed porcelain, presenting also various
colors, which seem to be constant in the particular species, from pale
primrose to sage green or light indigo, or from chocolate brown to pink-
ish orange.”t

Incubation is performed by the male,i astrong Ratite character; nest
‘a mere scrape, insufficiently lined with a few grass-leaves.”§ Herr
von Nathusius has further observed that the minute structure of the
eggshell of a Tinamou “is quite different from that of the true Galli,

and more resembles that of apteryx.”* In form they are more or less
globular and completely opaque. This last-named character in the
eges of birds is a very interesting one to the student. Prof. Newton,
who has thrown so much light for us upon the subject of avian oGdlogy,
remarks upon this point that “In form, eggs vary very much, and this is
sometimes observable in examples not only of the same species but
even from the same mother, yet a certain amount of resemblance is
usually to be traced according to the natural group to which the par-
ents belong. Those of the Owls (Strigide and of some of the Picaria—
especially those which lay the glossy eggs above spoken of—are often
apparently spherical, though it is probable that if tested mathematie-
ally none would be found truly so; indeed it may be asserted that
few eggs are strictly symmetrical, however nearly they may seem so,
one side bulging out, though very slightly, more than the other. The
really oval form with which we are most familiar needs no remark, but
this is capable of infinite variety caused by the relative position and
proportion of the major and minor axis. In nearly all the Limicole
and some of the Alcide the egg attenuates very rapidly towards the
smaller end, sometimes in a slightly convex curve, sometimes without
perceptible curvature, and occasionally in a sensibly concave curve.

The eggs having this pyriform shape are mostly those of birds which
invariably lay 4 in a nest, and therein they lie with their points almost
meeting in the center and thus occupying as little space as possible
and more easily covered by the brooding parent. Other eggs, as those
of the Sand Grouse ( Pterocleid@), are elongated and almost cylindrical
for a considerable part of their length, terminating at each end obtusely,
while eggs of the Grebes (Podicipedide), which also have both ends
nearly alike, but pointed, are so wide in the middle as to present a
biconical appearance.t

The remarkable variation in both color and form of the eggs of many
of our North American birds can nowhere be better studied and appre-
ciated than is the splendid quarto (with its many beautifully colored
plates), recently published by Capt. Bendire,i and in the treatises of
corresponding magnitude of other authors, as those of Wolley, Thiene-

* Journ. fiir wissensch. Zoologie., 1871, pp. 330-355. Mr. Lucas, of the U. S.
National Museum, tells me that the egg of Apteryx is white, and the shell like that
of a hen’s egg.

mann, Hewitson, Brewer, of this country, Taczanowski, Lefevre, Bade-
ker, and special memoirs in the publications of the learned societies.

With the information then upon the form of birds’ eggs in general given
as above by Newton, and the facts that birds so low in the scale of organ-
ization as the Ostriches, Emus, Cassowaries, Apteryx, Tinamous, and
Penguins lay eggs varying all the way from 1 to 30, being either globular
or ellipsoidal in form, white or unitinted in color, with highly polished
shells or the reverse case, I turned to the odlogy of existing reptiles
to ascertain if possible what its study would offer in contrast. With
this in view I communicated with my friend Prof. Samuel Garman, of
the Museum of Comparative Zoédlogy of Harvard College, and in his
reply the following facts were kindly placed at my disposal.* That
distinguished herpetologist, observes: ‘All eggs of reptiles, so far as
I know, are white. Those eggs with a limy covering are pure white;
those leather-covered, without the lime, are sometimes dingy to yellow-
ish, or flesh tinted. Marine tortoises lay spherical eggs. So, also, do
various river tortoises, as Podocnemys of the Amazon. In species lay-
ing ellipsoidai eggs individuals sometimes vary to the spheroidal, in
the snapping tortoise (Chelydon) for instance. Some of the land or box
tortoises lay a very small number of eggs, possibly the smallest among
the reptiles. The largest number is attained by sea tortoises, species
of which are said to lay more than 200 in aseason. The Grocadiluiden
also lay large numbers. Some of the smaller lizards lay very few; the
average will probably be smaller in lizards than in tortoises or snakes.
The lizard’s eggs with which I am acquainted are all ellipsoidal in
shape. A near approach to the spheroid is made in some cases, as
Gonatodes, a small Geckoid. The greatest departure from the sphe-
roid is seen in some snakes, as for instance Scatophis or Pityophis. Of
tortoises or lizards I know none that incubate, though some of the lat-
ter have acted as if keeping guard over the eggs until hatched. As
you are aware various lizards and snakes hatch the eggs before extru-
sion, being ovoviviparous. The pythons coil around the eggs to hatch
them. Both ends of the reptile egg are usually alike; neither is pointed
asina bird. The alligator, as you know, has a habit of nesting like
that of the Megapodes of the birds.”

It is as well to remark at this point that, according to Wallace,t the

Dr; mead Stejneger, curator 3eF ine department of eae U. S. National
Museum, also sent me a letter on the samesubject, for which I desire to express my
thanks. Such information as he was able to furnish me, however, is contained in
Prof. Garman’s letter, where the ground is more fully covered.

+Wallace, A. R., The Malay Archipelago, New York, 1869, p. 166. Upon pages 402
and 403 of this work the author also says of M. wallacei that it ‘‘ comes down to the
seabeach to deposit its eggs; but instead of making a mound or patching a hole
to receive them, it burrows into the sand to the depth of about 3 feet obliquely
downward and deposits its eggs at the bottom. It then loosely covers up the mouth
of the hole, and is said by the natives to obliterate and disguise its own footmarks

COMPARATIVE OOLOGY OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS. 465

Megapodes lay brick-red eggs, and Sharpe tersely remarks in his Classi-
fication of Birds, ‘Nest none. Eges deposited in a mound raised by
many of the birds in concert. Young hatched without the intervention
of the parent bird, and able to fly almost from birth” (p. 68). It would
seem then that in the nesting habits of the Megapodes, we see not a little
to remind us of the corresponding habits in some ofthe reptiles. Ae-
cording to Gibson crocodiles “are oviparous, depositing their eggs,
from 20 to 60 in number and inclosed in a calcareous shell, in holes
made in the sand or mud of the river side, where they are left to be
hatched by the heat of the sun, or asin the case with certain Ameri-
can species, in hillocks formed by themselves which they hollow out
and fill with leaves and other decaying vegetable matter, where the
eggs are hatched by the heat generated in the decomposing mass.”*
The very distinguished herpetologist, Prof. E. D. Cope, also brietly
writes me thus, his communication being dated Philadelphia, Decem-
ber 15, 1892: “As to reptile eggs I know of none excepting those of Croe-
“ odilia, which are not elliptic and white. Tortoises lay more eges than
either lizards or snakes, so far as known. No incubation among rep-
tiles is known to me excepting in the cases of Pythonid snakes. I
must add that a great deal remains to be known on the subject.”

Among the CRACES the nest is placed in a tree, the eggs are white
and two in number. (Sharpe, loc. cit., p. 68.) .

With the facts that I have enumerated in the foregoing paragraphs
at our command, we can next pass to the consideration of the oblogy
of the various groups of birds occurring in the avifauna of the United
States, and here, relying as I do upon the published works of authors,
who are widely recognized as authorities in such matters, I find the
greatest amount of variance in the descriptions. These differences of
opinion refer to the number of eggs laid by any particular species of
bird, to the coloration of the eggs, and to the questions of nesting and
incubation. In cases where, from the rarity of specimens, or where
the eggs of certain species are known to vary even in the ecluteh laid
by the same individual, and so on, there may be some excuse for this,
but in cases where hundreds or even thousands of eggs of the same
species have been examined by competent describers, it would seem
that it is about time we had something like uniformity in description.
This is only too frequently not the case, as the reader later on will soon
discover.

Among our more lowly organized groups of birds stand the Divers
(Urinatoroidea), and Grebes (Podicipoidea), related as they are to the

extinct toothed-birds of the genus Hesperornis,* and yet their nidifica-
tion is not as indicative of reptilian affinity as is that of some of the
higher groups. Of course it is not at all likely that we shall ever
know what the eggs of any of the toothed birds looked like, or much less
what their breeding habits were, but it is fair to presume that it dif-
fered in important particulars from existing Pygopodes. I am of the
opinion, however, that all the early reptiles and reptile-like birds laid
white eggs, of either an ellipsoidal or of a spheroidal form, and they
were not hatched by the parents. In number they may have been few
or many.

Authors appear to be agreed that with respect to the Grebes they
build a nest of rushes and sedges, etc., which to a greater or less extent
floats upon the surface of the water in ponds and marshes among the
reedy growths there occurring. They differ, however, in their descrip-
tions of the eggs. Newton says their eggs have “a chalky white shell
almost equally pointed at each end;”.+ Ridgway states ‘“‘eggs 2 to 5, |
dull white, bluish-white, or very pale bluish-green,” while Coues
observes that “the eggs are more numerous than in other pygopdous
birds, frequently numbering 6 to 8; elliptical, of a pale or whitish color,
unvariegated; commonly covered with chalky substance.t Dr. Sharpe,
in his Classification of Birds, says the eggs are white,§.but does not
mention the number laid by members of this group. Both in form and
color, then, Grebes’ eggs remind us of reptiles’, which is not the ease in
either particular with the Divers. Here we find according to Coues that
the Colymbida “lay two or three dark-colored spotted eggs in a rude nest
of rushes by the water’s edge” (loc. cit., p. 789), while Ridgway declares
the eggs to be but two, * elongate-ovate, deep brown or olive, latter
sparsely speckled or spotted with dark brown and blackish” (loc. cit., p.7).
Sharpe says nothing about their being spotted, but that they are two
in number and of a “dark olive-brown” (loe. cit., p.7). The eggs of these
birds are probably spotted and the fact is an important one, as it is not
only a point of difference between their eggs and those of the Grebes,
but in that particular they differ from the eggs of any known reptile.
They are the first eggs that have markings on them that we meet with
among the lower groups of our birds. The difference in form is equally
important, as it is likewise the first departure from the reptilian ellip-
soidal or spheroidal form of egg, it being in the Divers larger at one end
than it is at the other.

The TUBINARES is another group wherein we find the birds laying, as
arule, an ovate or subovate egg that may be spotted or pure white.

Passing next to the Auks (ALC 4) we find Dr. Sharpe briefly referring
to them as follows: “Egg single, white when in a burrow, otherwise
of varied and beautiful color and markings when laid on a rock”
(loc. cit., p. 71), and Coues states it differently, inasmuch as he says “ eges
few or single, plain or variegated” (Key, p. 797.) Ridgway agrees with
Sharpe, declaring the “egg single,” though “variable as to form and
color” (Manual, p. 8). Coues, in describing the egg of Alle, again finds
an exception to Sharpe’s diagnosis, for he says the ‘single egg” laid
by that bird is pale greenish-blue (Key, p. 811), but confirms his state-
ment given above that Auks lay more than a single egg, in his deserip-
tion of Uria grylle, and he remarks of that species, the Common Black
Guillemot, that the ‘eggs, 2 to 3, sea-green, greenish-white or white,
spotted and blotched most irregularly with blackish-brown, and with
purplish shell markings” (Key, p. 815). According to this authority
then an Auk may lay as many as 3 eggs, and another species may lay
a blue unmarked egg. The Great Auk, probably now extinet, and one
of the most ancient types of the suborder ALC a, laid, as we know, a
single egg, which was a milk white, spotted and blotched with dark
brown. In form the eggs of Auks assume some modification of the
ovate, but are never ellipsoidal or spheroidal. We take it then, judg-
ing from such premises, that these birds stand much higher above the
reptiles than do any of the Ostrich types. It would seem that this sub-
ject will bear its share of thorough revision, for as I write these lines I
ascertain through the kindness of Capt. Bendire, who has kindly given
me access to the superb collection of birds’ eggs of the U. S. National
Musem, that Alle alle normally lays 2 eggs, and that they are of a very
pale greenish-blue, almost white. They are very uniform, both in form
and color, and the collection contains eight or ten sets of them. This

does not fully agree with either the statements of Coues or Ridgway;
and we find similar discrepancies in the next suborder or the LONGI-
PENNES, as the subjoined table clearly shows.

Gulls, Jaegers, Terns, and Skimmers (hynchops) all lay eggs of some
form of the ovate or “short” ovate. Chionis minor, it may be inter-
esting to know in this connection, “lays 2 or 3 eggs,”* which accord-
ing to Dr. Kidder differ much in color, the general tint, however being
a café au lait, irregularly blotched with several shades of dark sepia-
brown, chiefly near the larger end; but according to Dr. Sharpe the
blotches are of a “‘purple” color (loc. cit., p: 72).

As we know, among the Limicola, the eggs are generally four in
number, with a ground color of some shade of buff or olive, more or
less spotted and blotched, and of a pyriform shape. The markings
are commonly of some shade of brown, almost black in some instances,
or purplish. Coues, in his ‘¢ Key,” ignores the eggs of a great many of
the limicoline birds, including such interesting forms as the Woodcock,
Oyster Catchers, and Turnstones. The study of the odlogy of this
group is important, for ‘‘ Perhaps the greatest scientific triumph of
odlogists lies in their having fully appreciated the intimate alliance of
the Limicole (the great group of Snipes and Plovers), with the Gavie
(the Gulls, Terns, and other birds more distantly connected with them),
before it was recognized by any professed taxonomist, L’Herminier,
whose researches have been much overlooked, excepted ; though to
such an one was given the privilege of placing that affinity beyond
cavil” (Huxley, Proc. Zod]. Soc., 1867, pp. 426, 456-458; cf. Ibis, 1868,
p. 92).t

If for our present purposes we include in a suborder (HERODIONES)
the Ibises, the Storks, the Herons, Egrets, Bitterns, and their natural

COMPARATIVE OOLOGY OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS. 469

allies, we have an interesting group, presenting a number of peculiarities
in their ojlogy. Dr. Sharpe says of the Ibises (‘ Platalew”) that in
Platalea the eggs are “ greenish-white” with spots, while in Jbis they
are “oreen” (l.¢, p. 75). Now, Coues makes the statement that the
eges of our American Spoonbill (Ajaja) are usually 3 in number,
‘nearly elliptical and white” (Key, p. 652), while Mr. Ridgway gives
an entirely different description of them when he says that they are
‘ovate, white, or buffy white, blotched, spotted, and strained with
various shades of brown” (Man., p. 125).

A similar confusion of description is extended to the eggs of Ibises,
Coues says the eggs of the Glossy Ibis (P. falcinellus) are ovoidal in
shape and “egreenish-blue” in color (Key, p. 649), while Ridgway re-
marks that both Glossy Ibis and White-faced Glossy Ibis lay eggs of a
‘‘plain greenish verditer blue” color (Manual, p. 114); and Coues says
the last-named species lays green eggs, 3 or 4, rarely 5 in number (Key,
p. 651). Ridgway states that both the White Ibis and the Scarlet [bis
(G. alba and rubra) lay eggs that are “ greenish-white, buffy, or pale
brownish, stained, blotched, and spotted with brown” (Manual, p. 123).
Coues describes the eggs (5 in number) of G. alba as being of a “dull,
chalky white, blotched, and spotted with pale yellowish and dark red-
ish-brown” (Key, p. 651). When Dr. Sharpe in his description said the
eggs of the [bis were “green,” as cited above, he must have referred to
the Glossy Ibis, and not the Sacred Ibis (Plegadis faleinellus and not
Ibis ethiopica), though he says ‘ Ibis.” Newton observes that the eggs
of the Sacred Ibis ‘are of adingy white, splashed, spotted, and speckled
with reddish-brown ;” and further remarks of the Glossy Ibis (P. falei-
nellus) that ‘“‘one of the most remarkable things about this species is that
it lays eggs of a deep sea-green color, having wholly the character of
heron’s eggs, and it is noticed that it often breeds in company with
herons, while the eggs of all other Ibises, whose eggs are known, re-
semble those of the Sacred Ibis.” (Art. “Ibis,” Eneyl. Brit., v. x11,
p. 607.)

Tantaius loculator, according to Coues, lays “eggs 2 to 3, elliptical
in contour, shell rough, with flaky substance; color white (Key, p. 653),
while Ridgway contends that the eggs of this bird are ‘ usually more
or less stained, in streaks, with pale brownish.” (Manual, p. 125.)

Mr. Ridgway says that all our North American Herons (Ardea, Nycti-
corax) lay “plain, bluish-green eggs, varying in depth of color” (1. ¢., p.
128); Sharpe remarks that the eggs of the Ardew are * generally blue”
(l.¢., p. 75); while Dr, Coues pretty thoroughly covers the ground for
the Herons when he observes that they ‘are altricial, and generally
nest in trees or bushes (where their insessorial feet enable them to
perch with ease), in swampy or other places near the water, often in
large communities, building a large, flat, rude structure of sticks. The
ege’s vary in number, coincidently, to some extent, with the size of the
species; the larger Herons generally lay 2 or 5, the smaller kinds 5 or
6; the eggs are somewhat elliptical in shape and usually of an unyarie-

gated bluish or greenish shade.” (Key, p. 656.) When we come to the
Bitterns, however, a peculiar difference is to be noted, and the descrip-
tion of their odlogical characters are set forth in the subjoined table:

If the Bitterns are to be considered as a subfamily of the Ardeide
(Ardew Sharpe), it can not be truly said that all the representatives of
such a group lay blue eggs.

More uniformity seems to exist among authors in their descriptions
of the eggs of the Cranes, Rails, and their allies (suborder PALUDI-
coL#). Selecting the works [ have thus far consulted, we find the fol-

lowing characters variously given:

From what this table shows it would appear that in so far as their
odlogy seems to indicate, the Cranes and Rails are not very intimately
related and I find Dr. Sharpe, in his Classification of Birds, placing
them widely asunder, though he retains the “ Arami” with his GRUT-
FORMES (order XIX), and the ‘* Podicw” with the RALLIFORMES
(Order X). Dr. Gadow retains them both in GRUIFORMES. (P. Z. 8.
1892, pp. 244, 245).

Our next group is the STEGANOPODES, and I find considerable differ-
ence of opinion exists not only as to the number of eges normally laid
by steganopodous birds, but as to the general character of those eggs.
Coues, in presenting the odlogy of the group, says: “The eggs are
very few, frequently only one, usually if not always plain-colored, and
inerusted with a peculiar white chalky substance” (p. 719).

Dr. Coues makes no record of the characters of the egg of Phaéthon
in his “ Key” (pp. 731, 732), but Ridgway describes the egg of the
genus (common char.) as ‘‘egg ova‘e, dilute claret-brown or whitish,
speckled, sprinkled, spotted or blotched with deep claret-brown” (p.
74). Dr. Sharpe says of his Phaethontes, “Egg, one only ; mottled
reddish-brown” (p. 76). This is a curious departure from the steganop-
odous birds generally, and so far as it goes, reminds us of the Longi-
pennes in color, that is being spotted, but Steganopodes, in being but
one of them laid.

Prof. Newton says Sula bassana lays only a “single egg” with
‘4 white shell of the same chalky character asa Comorant” (A. N., Art.
“Gannet,” Eneyl. Brit., vol. x, p. 71), but that Pelecanus, or the Pelicans,
lay ‘2 eggs commonly” (Art. “ Pelican,” loc. cit., vol. XVIII, p.475). Here
certainly authors do differ most widely. Dr. Sharpe declaring that
Pelicans lay but “one egg only.” Prof. Newton says two, and Ridg-
way says they lay as many as four.

A sinilar diversity of opinion appears to be extended to the odlogy
of the representatives of the next group of birds, the ODONTOGLOSS 4.

Prof. Sharpe says the Flamingoes lay a ‘single white egg” (Ll. ¢.,
p. 76), while most other authorities claim the clutch consists of tio
for those birds. Ridgway says “ eggs [not how many] are pure chalk-
white and of an elongate ovate, or cylindrical ovate ” form. (Manual
p. 121.) Possibly he may mean two or more.

Dr. Coues is positive about it when he observes for Phanicopterus
ruber, “ Kegs 2, 3.25 2.10, with thick shells, roughened with white
flaky substance, bluish when this is scraped away” (p. 679). Mlamin-
goes’ eggs have been known for a long time, and Newton, quoting
Dampier, observes* that these birds ‘never lay more than two eggs
and seldom fewer.”

Coming next to the Swans, Geese, Ducks, and their allies (ANSERES),
the statements are more uniform in character, and the general one of Dr.
Coues “the eggs are usually of some plain pale color, as greenish, drab,
or creamy; the clutch varies in number, commonly ranging from half
a dozen to a dozen and a half” (p. 681); or that of Dr. Sharpe, “eggs
numerous, creamy buff, or greenish white, or pure white” (p. 76), will
probably cover the ground. Our Swans lay from 2 to 5 eggs, rough-
shelled, and of a dull white color (Coues), while among the Geese we find
Philacte canagica lays 5 eggs, which are white, ‘‘ with fine pale brown
dotting, giving a general pale dirty brown color,” and Branta canaden-
sis lays as many as ‘5 to 9, ellipsoidal, smooth, pale dull greenish”
(Coues, pp. 686-688). The number becomes still greater among the
Ducks, and our American Wigeon (M. americana) often lays as
many as 12 eggs of a “dull pale buff” color, and the little Buffle-head
(C. albeola) as many as 14, they being of an ellipsoidal form and of a
“buffy-drab tint (between greenish-olive and rich creamy-white”

“Newton, A.: Art. ‘‘ Flamingo,” Eneycl. Brit. vol. 1x, p. 286, cites Dampier, New
Voyage round the World, ed. 2, corrected, vol. 1, p. 71, London, 1697,
COMPARATIVE OOLOGY OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS. 473

(Coues, p. 706). Eider Ducks also lay from 8 to 10 drab-colored eggs,
and the Mergansers lay about an equal number—they being white in
the Hooded Mergansers (1. cucullatus) (Ridgway). Swans and Geese,
then, as a rule, lay the fewest number of eggs, and certain varieties of
the smaller species of Ducks the greatest number, and at least one an-
serine bird lays spotted eggs (P. canagica—the Emperor Goose).

When we come to examine the odlogy of the great Columbo-gallina-
ceous group, one well represented in the avifauna of the United States,
it is possible to make the comparisons quite extensive, owing to Ben-
dire’s exhaustive labors, as seen in his fine quarto volume already
spoken of at the beginning of this paper. ‘This I shall endeavor to do

As will be seen from this table, and as has long been known, the
eggs of the Fowl series differ very materially from those of the Colum-
bine series of birds. In this connection I quote the following from Dr.
Sharpe: “As far as their osteology goes the sand grouse are very
columbine, and had they oceurred in a fossil state only they would
probably have been placed in the Columb. * * * Nest none.
Eges three, double-spotted, equally rounded at both ends. Nestling
Galline. Young clothed with down like the young of a Partridge, but
more variegated with white tufts.” (Class of Birds, p. 69.)

Among the Cathartide and Raptorial birds (ACCIPITRES), exclusive of
Striges, we tind a great diversity of eggs, both in the matter of form and
color. This seems to be especially true of the Hawks, Eagles, and their
allies, where not only the same species may lay very different-appearing
eggs, but in some cases the same individual may do likewise and variously
COMPARATIVE OOLOGY OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS. 475

tinted eggs be discovered in the same clutch. According to Bendire
the California Vulture (Pseudogryphus) lays two elongate ovate, slightly
glossy eggs of a uniform light grayish-green color and unspotted.
They differ from the eggs of other Vultures in that they are “close
grained and deeply pitted” (p.161). Of the Turkey Vulture (Cathartes
aura) he observes that ‘two eggs are usually laid, occasionally but
one, and very rarely three. These are among the handsomest eggs of
the Raptores. Their ground color is generally a light creamy tint,
oceasionally a dull, dead white, with a very faint trace of green in some
few instances. They are blotched, smeared, and spotted with various
shades of reddish-brown, chocolate, and lavender, the markings usually
predominating about the larger end of the egg, and very irregular in
outline. In eggs belonging to the same set the markings frequently
differ greatly in size and intensity, one being heavily marked and the
other but slightly. Occasionally an egg is found which is entirely
unspotted. The eggs also vary greatly in shape; the majority are
elongate ovate, a few are ovate, others elliptical ovate, and now and
then one is perfectly cylindrical ovate” (p. 164). Catharista atrata,
on the other hand, lays eggs which ‘are readily distinguished from
those of the Turkey Vulture by their different ground color, somewhat
larger size, and fewer markings as a rule. By far the greater num-
ber of eggs are elongate ovate, a few are short ovate, others elliptical
ovate. Their ground color is a pale gray-green; in none of the speci-
mens before me can it be called a creamy white; the tint is perceptibly
different. In an occasional specimen it may be called pale bluish-
white, like well-watered milk, but the first-mentioned color predomi-
nates. ‘The markings vary from chocolate to reddish-brown of differ-
ent tints, and mixed among these, in about half of the specimens,
are found shell markings of lilac and lavender; in an occasional speci-
men these predominate over the first-mentioned tints. In the series
before me all the markings are rather irregular in shape and are clus-
tered about the larger end of the egg. They are usually large and
seldom confluent. A few eggs are but slightly marked, and the spots
are small and fine, but none are entirely unspotted.” (Loe. cit., pp. 167,
168.)

We now come to the Falconide, a group of birds which are known,
as a rule, to lay very beautiful eggs, and one has but to examine the
richly colored and thoroughly accurate figures in Capt. Bendire’s work
to fully appreciate this fact.

Ridgway observes that Hlanus leucurus lays from 2 to 3 eggs, but
Bendire says they lay more than that commonly, and that the ‘set varies
from 3 to 5, generally 4.” They are of great beauty, the “ ground color
is creamy white, and they are heavily marked over their entire surface
with irregular confluent blotches and smears of dark blood red and
claret brown, of different degrees of intensity, the smaller end being
often the more heavily colored. But little of the ground color is visible
A76 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

in the majority of the specimens. Some sets are much lighter than
others, possibly a second laying. The eggs are usually oval in shape.”
(Bendire.) Coues contends that one of these Kites may lay as many as
6 eggs, and that in form they are “‘subspherical.” —(p. 525.)

The question of the difference in egg markings of birds of the same
species, or even, as I have said, in the eggs of the same individual, is
one of greatinterest. From all that has been gathered it would appear
to largely depend upon the physical condition of the parent bird at the
time of depositing the egg. Captivity and fright have also their influ-
ence, the secretions of the oviduct being often checked or even entirely
arrested at such times. Age likewise has much to do with it, and the
fact is now pretty well established that the older a bird is the more in-
tensely will its eggs be colored, meaning, as I do, of course, those species
which lay colored eggs, either tinted all over or with varied markings.
Young birds of the first season lay lighter eggs in all respects, for ex-
ample, than those individuals which have bred for many years.

Another American Kite, [ctinia mississippiensis, lays, according to
Bendire, usually but two eggs, or at the most 3. “They are
rounded, ovate in shape, pale bluish white in color, and unspotted, or,
as the rarest exception, show ‘a few minute deeper blue shell markings.’
(P.179.) The eggs of this species were unknown to Dr. Coues. They
are frequently adventitiously stained. The Everglade Kite (Rostrha-
mus sociabilis) also lays 2 or 3 eggs which are ‘blotched, marbled,
and stained with various shades of brown on a paler (Sometimes bluish
white) ground color’” (Ridgway, p. 226.) In the Marsh Hawk we
find a greater number of eggs laid (Circus hudsonius), as many as 6
according to Bendire (p. 186), and 8 in Ridgway’s account (p. 226).
They are commonly plain, with a white or bluish white ground color,
but may be blotched and spotted with light buff and brown markings.
They assume some form of the ovate in contour, and are generally
elossy-shelled and smooth. ie

From this it will be seen that the eggs of Hawks may vary greatly in
the same genus, from an unspotted white egg (A. atricapillus) to a ee
ish white egg, heavily marked all over (A. velowv.).

Harris’s Hawk (Parabuteo) also lays three or four eggs, which are
white or a buff white, and show more or fewer light brown markings.
About half the eggs of this species also lack markings. The eggs of
our common Red-tailed Hawk (Buteo borealis), which I have collected
upon numerous occasions, vary wonderfully in point of size. There are
generally four to the clutch, and have a ground color of bluish white.
Some have — spots, others are irregularly marked with various brown-
ish tints, which markings are of the greatest variety, no two specimens
being exactly alike in pattern with respect to size, color, intensity, or
distribution. Unspotted eges occur in the same set with spotted ones.
Bendire says of the Zone-tailed Hawk (Buteo abbreviatus) that its “eggs
vary from 1 to 3 in number, usually 2, and seem to be for the most part
unspotted. They are oblong oval in shape, pale bluish white in color,
and the shell is rather smooth and finely granulated.” (p. 233.)

Hawks of the genus Falco as a rule lay dark-colored eggs, more or
less covered all over with markings of various shades of brown. Falco
mexicanus, however, lays from 2 to 5 creamy white eggs, more or less
sprinkled over with madder-brown spots and markings. Other whit-
ish-colored eggs of species of this genus may have the ground color al-
most entirely hidden or obscured by the markings being so numerous
and close together. The egg of the Aplomado Falcon is an instance of
this kind. Audubon’s Caracara ( Polyborus cheriway) also lays from 2 to
3 eggs, which, according to Bendire, are ‘‘oval in shape; the ground
color, when visible, which is not often the case, is creamy white, and in
the majority of specimens is entirely hidden, the egg appearing to be
of a uniform rufous cinnamon of different shades, some of the darker ap-
proaching vinaceous rufous. This is again overlaid with irregilar
blotches and spots of dark chocolate, claret, brown, and burnt umber.
Most of these eggs are heavily marked, a few, however, only slightly,
and in these the markings are usually small and more regular in out-
line, a few are unspotted, and although the ground color is not visible it

‘is entirely overlaid with an even-colored cinnamon tint.” (pp. 317, 318.)
It would be impossible here, without far exceeding the limits of space,
to begin to describe the eggs of the Osprey (Pandion). They are all
wonderfully handsome, but vary in size, form, ground colors, and mark-
ings to an endless degree. To view Capt. Bendire’s beautifully-colored
figures of them (PI. x1) one can hardly believe that they were laid by
the same species of bird. Still the eggs of Polyborus shown upon the
same plate vary quite as much and in the same particulars, and even
more so in the matter of size.

Kagles, as in the case of the Falcons and Hawks, lay but few eggs,
rarely more than three, and they also range from a pure white egg
(Haliwétus leucocephalus) tooneshowing upon its surface speckles, spots,
478 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

blotches, and a clouding with brown and. gray (Aquila). Bendire re-
marks of the Harpy Eagle (Thrasaétus harpyia) that “I have been un-
able to find a correct description of the egg of this species,” and he
supplies one from the specimens of that bird in the U. S. National
Museum, and observes “the eggs are white, with yellowish-brown dots
and washes, and about as long, though not quite as heavy, as a hen’s
egg. Of these eggs the Harpy lays 4 or 5, but never hatches more
than 2, and, if the Indians can be believed, feeds the first two eaglets
that make their appearance with the contents of the remaining eggs”
(p. 271).

Coming next to the PstTTAct, I find that neither Coues nor Ridgway
give in their works the number of eggs laid by our Carolina Paroquet
(Conurus carolinensis); the former says ‘“‘eggs whitish, 1.40 x 1.05,
elliptical in shape, rough in texture” (p. 496), and the latter, “eggs
1.39 x 1.07, ovate, short ovate, or rounded ovate, pure white” (p. 270).
Dr.Sharpe says simply ‘‘egg white” for his Order Psittaciformes (p.83),
[ am of the opinion that the fact is not exactly known, and the truth of
the matter is, we stand sadly in need of a knowledge of much in the
biology of this entire and large group of most interesting birds.

CoccyGeés: The parasitic habits of the European Cuckoo (C. canorus)
are too well known to require comment here, and Coues observes that
‘the American Cuckoos have been declared free of suspicion of such
domestic irregularities; but, though pretty well behaved, their record
is not quite clean: they do sometimes slip into the wrong nest. The
curious infelicity seems to be connected in some way with the inability
of the female to complete her clutch of eggs with the rapidity and regu-
larity usual among birds, and so incubate them in one batch. The
nests of our species of Coccygus commonly contain young by the time
the last egg of the lot is laid” (p. 471). Such habits, however, are de-
parted from by the genus Crotophaga, birds which build a large nest for
the use of a number of the species to lay in in common. In Geococcyx
and Coccygus, species that lay numerous eggs at irregular intervals, we
find often a fresh egg just laid and perhaps a nestling half as large as
the parent bird, with an intermediate gradation of eggs in various
stages of incubation and young grading up to the size of the one just”
mentioned.

Crotophaga ani may lay asmany as 8 eggs, which according to Coues
are “greenish” and to Ridgway a “dull glaucous-blue,” but they are
always more or less overlaid with a white substance chalky in nature,
that in the recently laid egg easily washes off. Our Ground Cuckoo
(Geococcyx) also lays white eggs or of a pale lbuff-white, and there may
be as many as a dozen deposited before the bird completes her irregu-
larly lain clutch. Opinions do not agree as to the number of eggs laid
by our common Yellow-billed Cuckoo (C. americanus), Dr. Coues stating
‘“‘egos 4 to 8, pale greenish” (p. 476), and Ridgway, ‘eggs 2 to 4, dull
pale glaucous-green or glaucous-white” (p. 273). And the latter au-
thority says of the Black-billed Cuckoo (C. erythrophthalmus “eggs 2
COMPARATIVE OOLOGY OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS. 479

to 4, deep glaucous-green or verditer-blue” (p. 274). The present writer
discovered the nest of one of this latter species many years ago in New
England, and it had four eggs in and tivo nestlings. It was a very
slight affair for a nest, loosely put together with scanty material of
twigs, ete., and placed upon the horizontal bough of a small apple tree.

I have never seen the eggs of any of the TROGONES, and personaliy
know nothing of the nesting of our United States species 7. ambiguus.
Prof. Newton, however, remarks, “so. far as has been observed, the
nidification of tliese birds is in holes in trees, wherein are laid without
any bedding 2 roundish eggs, generally white, but certainly in one
species (Quezal) tinted with bluish-green” (Art, ‘‘Trogon,” Eneyel.
Brit., vol. xxi, p. 584). Doctor Sharpe makes a like statement, but
no exceptions thereto. ‘Nest in hole of tree, eggs white” (Class. of
Birds, p. 82).

We have two species of Kingfishers (ALCYONES) in our avifauna,
Ceryle aleyon and Ceryle cabanisi. Hither species usually lay six pure
white eges of an-ovate or oval form. They are characterized by
having smooth, glossy shells, which in the case of the last named
species is very thin and brittle, having the appearance of being com-
posed of porcelain. Such glossy and glassy, pure, white eggs are
also laid by every species of our Woodpeckers (Pict), and those birds
are very humerous in our avifauna—nearly forty of them. Ridgway
in his ** Manual” barely mentions the eggs of these birds, and Coues
simply says that in form they are “‘rounded” (p. 479). Most all the
species lay 6 to the clutch, but in Dryobates villosus and Colaptes 7 are -
sometimes taken. Probably in nearly all the species the eggs are more
or less of an oval or ovate shape; all that I have ever collected I have
found to be so.

In noticing the eggs of our Owls (STRIGES), I will rely almost entirely
upon Bendire’s work, so frequently quoted in this article.

From this table it will be seen that our largest Owls lay both the least
ntunber (Bubo) as well as nearly the greatest number (NVyctea) of eggs,
the greatest number, however, probably being laid by the Burrowing
Owls (Speotyto). In other words, it may be tersely said that our Striges
lay from two to a dozen white, oval eggs, varying somewhat with the
species.

An equally useful table for the odlogy of our CAPRIMULGI can be
compiled from Dr. Coues’s “‘ Key,” and his descriptions of the eggs of
those birds is quite full.

The following is what he records upon the subject:

Odlogy of N. American Caprimulgi.

Antrostomus carolinensis ....-.- Eggs 2; 1.45 x 1.05; heavily marked in intricate pat-
tern with browns and neutral tints.

A. vociferus.....--..---..-----Eggs 2; 1.25 x 0.90; creamy white; heavily marked

Phalwonoptilus nuttalli ....---- Eggs 2; 1.05 x 0.80; elliptical; white.

Nyctidromus albicollis .....---- Eggs 2; 1.25 x 0.92; creamy buff, spotted with pinkish
brown and lilac.

Chordeiles virginianus .....---- Eggs 2; elliptical; 1.52 x 0.87; finely variegated with

stone-gray and other neutral tints, over which is
scratched and pitted dark olive-gray; but the pat-
tern and tints are very variable.

C. texensis ..........---..-.---Eggs 2; heavily veined and marbled; 1.20 x 0.87.

The most remarkable exception, if it be true, among these birds,
then, is the elliptical white ega of Phalwonoptilus. For the Caprimulgi
as a group, Dr. Sharpe says: ‘ Eggs white, with scroll-like markings
and spots” (p. 18), and Ridgway, for the family Caprimulgida, “ Eggs
deposited on bare ground, dead leaves, gravel, or sand, 2 broadly
elliptical—oval, plain or spotted” (Manual, p. 297), and of Phalwonoptilus
nuttalli, “0.99 x 0.78, plain dead white, usually with a faint buffy or
pinkish tinge” (p.299). This latter author’s descriptions of the eggs of
COMPARATIVE OOLOGY OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS. 481

our Goatsuckers differ quite materially from those of Dr. Coues, which
is probably due to the fact that the eggs of the several species them-
selves differ to such a marked degree both in color, form, and markings.

According to Newton, “The Guacharo (Steatornis) is said to build
a bowllike nest of clay, in which it lays 2 to 4 white eggs, with a
smooth but lusterless surface, resembling those of some Owls.” (Art.
‘‘Guacharo,” Encyel. Brit. 9th ed. Vol. xx1, p. 227.) And we may add,
this is not the only character we know of that indicates caprimulgo-
strigine affinity.

The Humming-birds need not detain us long; and it is very remarka-
ble that for so large a group there is such complete uniformity, so far
as we are at present aware, in their odlogy. ‘Tersely it may be said
that the TRocHILI all lay two pure white eggs, large for the bird in any
species, and generally of an elliptical-oval, or elliptical-ovate form.
These eggs remind me somewhat of the eggs of our smaller existing
lizards.

In another suborder, the CYPSELI we are still ignorant of the charae-
ter of the eggs of several of the species, but those of Chetura pelagica
are well known. In that species from 4 to 5 are usually in a set.
They are pure white, and narrowly elliptical in shape. The eggs of
Cypseloides niger have as yet not been collected by any naturalist that
Tam aware. The eggs, too, of Micropus melanoleucus are unknown to
me.

Lastly we come to that great host of birds included in the PASSERES,
and here I propose to contrast the descriptions of Coues and Ridgway,
confining myself principally to the various genera, occasionally only
to the family where the eggs of the birds in the latter are very similar.
Where birds of the same group differ to any marked degree such dif-
ferences will be noted. Where the eggs of others are unknown the
fact will also be shown; and I trust that such a table, condensed and
compared, although it may add nothing that is new to the subject,
will yet prove to be useful to the working odlogist.

This article would not be complete did I not add to it some of the
excellent observations of Prof. Alfred Newton and others relative to
the eggs of birds. After I have done this, I will draw up my ‘ Con-
eluding remarks.” Newton briefly gives us some excellent observa-
tions upon the “forms of the markings” on birds’ eggs, and these it
is not difficult to see “have been deposited on the shell a short time
before 1ts exclusion, are primarily and normally cireular, for hardly any
egg that bears markings at all does not exhibit some spots of that form,
but that in the progress of the eggs through that part of the oviduct
in which the coloring matter is laid on many of them became smeared,
dlotched, or protracted in some particular direction. The circular spots
thus betoken the deposition of the pigment while the egg is at rest, the
blurred markings show its deposition while the egg is in motion, and
this motion would seem often to be at once onward and rotatory, as in-
A486 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

dicated by the spiral markings not uncommonly observable in the eggs
of some birds of prey and others—the larger end of the egg (when the
ends differ in form) making way for the smaller.”*

“At the same time the eggs of a great number of birds have, besides
these last and superimposed markings, more deeply seated stains, gen-
erally of a paler and often of an altogether different hue, and these are
evidently due to some earlier dyeing process. The peculiar tint of the
ground color, though commonly superficial, if not actually congenital
with the formation of the shell, would appear to be diffused soon after.”
(Art. “ Birds,” Eneyel. Brit., 9th ed., Vol. I, p. 773.) This distin-
guished ornithologist also invites attention to the fact that ‘the size
of eggs is generally but not at all constantly in proportion to that of
the parent. The Guillemot (Alca troile) and the Raven (Corvus corax)
are themselves of about equal size. Their eggs vary as ten to one.”
(Loe. cit., p. 775.) Many other examples of this among our American
avifauna will be recalled by the thoughtful odlogist. Reasons for these
discrepancies are not far to seek, 7. e., nestling Ravens lay long in the
nest after birth, whereas young Guillemots are larger and better devel-
oped at the time of hatching. Then the number of eggs laid by a
Raven may be as many as 8 (see table), and, as we know, the Guillemot
lays but one, giving either bird about the same egg surface to cover
during incubation.

From my reading of avian odlogical works I find that certain expla-
nations, or partial explanations have been put forth as the reasons for
the variations in the colors of the shells of birds’ eggs. I formulate
these as follows:

BIOLOGICAL LAWS EXPLANATORY OF THE VARIATION IN COLOR OF
THE SHELLS OF EGGS IN THE CLASS AVES.

-1. In many instances the general color and markings are in conform-
ity with the law of protective coloration.

2. Where both sexes are more or less brilliantly colored the eggs
are generally laid where they are not exposed to view, and where the
parent hatching them is also concealed to a greater or less extent.
This is effected by either the form of nest constructed or by the eggs
being laid in burrows or hollow trees. The eggs of such birds are, as
a rule, not handsomely marked, or often only white. Otherwise in
general. irrespective of plumage, birds that lay in such places as have
just been mentioned usually lay white eggs.

*That the larger end is protruded first was found on actual experiment by Mr.
Bartlett, superintendent of the gardens of the Zodlogical Society, to be the case
commonly, but as anaccident the position may be sometimes reversed, and this will
most likely account for the occasional deposition of markings on the smaller instead
of the larger end, as not unfrequently shown in‘eggs of the Sparrow Hawk ( Accipiter
nisus). The head of the chick is always found at the larger end. [For a beautiful
example of the heavy deposition of nearly all the color at the small end of the egg,
see the one figured by Bendire of Accipiter velox, Pl. v, Fig. 17.—rR. W. S.]
COMPARATIVE OOLOGY OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS. 487

3. Where the general tone of the plumage of the incubating parent
is'in harmony with its environment, the eggs, as a rule, are laid in
open nests or places where they are fully exposed to view. Such eggs
are frequently very handsomely tinted and marked, or the reverse may
be the case.

4, When the female alone incubates, and is of dull or somber plum-
age, the male bird brilliantly feathered, the third law, as a rule, is op-
erative.

5. Frequently birds that lay eggs in open and exposed places, as di-
rectly on the ground, rock, or sand, without any apology for a nest,
their eggs are either tinted, or colored and marked, or both, so as to
be in harmony with their surroundings.

6. It is probable that the earliest forms of birds laid white, ellip-
soidal eggs, varying in number to the clutch from one to many. Pos-
sibly in some of the lower types of existing birds such an ancestral
trait has persisted.

7. In certain instances where birds lay exposed to view either white
or light tinted eggs, or those not otherwise protectively colored, they
have the habit of covering the clutch over with leaves, etc., when, for
any purpose, the incubating parent temporarily quits the nest.

8. Birds, irrespective of the character of the coloration of their
plumage, which habitually lay in inaccessible places, their eggs are often
either white or light-tinted and exposed to view.

9, Both the age of the bird and the physical condition of its consti-
tution at the time of laying an egg have their influence upon the color-
ation of its shell. Changes in the constitution may be due to external
sauses, as fright, etc., or to internal causes, as disease, etc. The rich-
est colored eggs of any species (that lay other eggs than white ones)
are laid by that species at its prime.

10. The positions of the egg as it passes down the oviduct, as well as
its motions, effect the pattern of its markings.

CONCLUDING REMARKS.

In the light of what has been presented in this paper we can now
briefly review some of the odlogical peculiarities of the birds of North
America.

Many Grebes (Podicipoidea) have the habit of covering over their
numerous white eggs with bits of vegetation when the parent tempo-
rarily quits the nest (seventh law), but whether the Loons ( Urinator oidea)
ever resort to this means of protection I am not at present informed,
though I am inclined to think they do not. The eggs of the latter, how-
ever, harmonize better with their surroundings (fifth law).

The American Tubinares, with but one or two exceptions, as far as
known, lay white eggs, oat they are protected, from the fact that they
are laid either in inaccessible or little frequented places (eighth law).
Birds rather low in the scale of organization, as the Short-tailed Alba-
488 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

tross (D. albatrus), which lay a “nearly equal-ended white egg,” and
where for many ages there may have been no special reason for 1t to
take on any other form or a pattern of varied coloration, possibly may
have done so through a long line of avian ancestors (sixth law).
Among the Alew lam not sure whether Alle lays its two unitinted
eggs in a concealed nest or the reverse. Otherwise the coloration of the
eges of the birds of this group can all be explained under the second,
third, and eighth laws as given above. iam inclined to think that the
handsomely marked eggs laid by the Longipennes gain protection under
the operation of the fifth law, and inmany cases where I have collected
the eggs of Gulls and Terns I have noticed that they often harmonize
admirably with their surroundings. It is almost a universally con-
ceded fact that this is distinctly so in the case of the Limicole, where
it is sometimes most beautifully exemplified.

Bitterns among the Herodiones are striking examples where the
species lay unitinted eggs, but the sitting bird has a plumage that is
in complete harmony with the environment of the nest. Even the
long pointed brown or dark-green feathers of the back and head simu-
late the thin lengthy sedge leaves when matted in mass on the ground.
With Herons which build in trees such a protection is less evident. In
the Rallide both the plumage of the bird and the coloration of the eggs
themselves are protective. This is also the case with the Grwda, an-
other family of the Paludicole.

Passing next to the Steganopodes we meet with another group of
bird forms, morphologically more or less lowly organized, which for
ages in the world’s history have probably laid their eggs in the most
inaccessible of places, and it is just possible that the eggs they now
lay, sometimes single and sometimes few (Cormorants), may be more or
less like those that were laid by their very early ancestors. The
elliptical white eggs of the Sulida, covered with a calcareous crust, are
very ditterent affairs from the more ordinary appearing eggs of water
birds higher in the scale of organized bird life. And, notwithstanding
their evident anserine affinities this may also apply to the Flamingoes
(Odontoglosse).

Odlogists generally express the opinion that the pale unitinted eggs
of the Anseres are protected against the pillaging of ordinary maraud-
ers, from the fact that nearly all birds of this group build their nests
or lay their eggs in inaccessible localities (eighth law). It must be
remembered, however, and it is a very interesting fact, that in the case
of the Swans (Cygning) the dull white shells of their eggs are frequently
adventitiously stained by the soil and especially by the wet and decay-
ing vegetation composing the rude nest in which they are deposited.
This often discolors them with a brownish, dirty shade, thus rendering
them the more difficult to be seen upon casual observation. This
applies likewise to the eggs of many Ducks (Anatine). But Ducks, too,
often lay drab, greenish or bufty tinted eggs harmonizing with their
COMPARATIVE OOLOGY OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS. 489

’ ) 7)

surroundings, and such hues are also characteristic of the eges of the
arboreal building Ducks, such as Aix, for example, which lays drab-
colored eggs, smooth and ellipsoidal in form. The still more typical
tree-Ducks of the genus Dendrocygna may lay whiteeges (D. autumnalis).

‘With our Gallina, birds which always build their simple nests
upon the ground, we find their large clutches of eggs either white, or
else more or less protectively marked, or finally made so by adventt-
tious staining (Colinus). These birds, however, as a rule, wear a
plumage that is preéminently in harmony with the nest surroundings,
and additional protection is undoubtedly afforded from the fact that
the incubating birds are all close sitters. There is an interesting
exception in this suborder in the case of the Massena Partridge
(Cyrtonyx). This curious bird, described by Vigors in 1830, remained
comparatively unknown up to the year 1890, at which time not an ege
of the species was in the possession of science, and even at this writing
it is one of the United States game birds with which we are the least
familiar as to its breeding or other habits. Strikingly showy in plum-
age it lays a glossy, white egg, but it resorts to breed to the moun-
tainous ravines in the western part of country, and this fact, in so far
as man is concerned, at least, is the reason its nest has been so rarely
discovered (eighth law). Judging from its other habits it is probably,
too, a very close sitter.

Pigeons (suborder Columba) lay, as a rule, white eggs, and both
sexes incubate in some of the species. Many of them are somber in
plumage, and make their nests upon the ground, or very near it. So
far as known they lay but two eggs to the set, but many of them breed
several times in the season. Those, like Hetopistes, which formerly re-
sorted to the forests in numberless hosts for the purpose, have been
largely exterminated through man’s agency. It would seem that with
such a species it mattered not what color their eggs may have assumed,
it would have afforded no protection whatever against any class of
despoilers. On the other hand, a little dove-like Columbigallina tre-
quently saves its eges by the habit it has of pitching suddenly off the
nest and fluttering about on the ground as if wounded, and leading
away the would-be robber of its treasures. Still, this bird, too, will
build in the most exposed sites about the habitations of men, where
their very gentleness and familiarity often protects them. If many
Should resort to this latter practice, and men rarely disturbed them
when breeding, it would manifestly afford a double protection, for egg-
eating mammals and birds, so common in the forests, would not likely
be found in such localities, and thus their nests be exempt from plunder
from such sources. Other birds, as many of the Limicole, have the
trick of playing wounded when their eggs- are endangered by man’s
approach; but if is a question in my mind whether, in many cases, it
does not defeat its very object, inasmuch as it often inspires the in-
490 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

truder to search for the nest. I have never had the opportunity to
observe how the subterfuge affects other animals below man.

The Accipitrine birds lay, as a rule, notoriously handsome eggs, but
they are commonly protected in two ways: (1) By the inaccessible places
where the species build their nests, as well as from the fact (2) that
many of the larger raptorial birds are fully capable of defending them
against robbery, often driving off man himself. Buzzards (Cathardide),
I believe, never defend their eggs by direct attack, nor do I personally
know of an instance where they vomit the contents of their stomachs
over the intruder, as I have had some of the Herons serve me (Ardea
virescens). It is a remarkable fact that the eggs of Cathartes and
Pseudogryphus difter so in their characters, and we have at present no
explanation to offer on the subject. It has its significance, however,
and future researches nay solve such problems. Audubon states that
our Carolina Paroquet deposits its two eggs, which are light greenish-
white, in the hollow of a tree, and that many females of the species lay
them together at the bottom of the same cavity (Conurus: PSITTACT).
They are examples of the second law given above, and this apparently
applies with equal truth to the TROGONEs.

Exactly why the CoccyGEs should lay either white or unitinted eggs
the present writer, at this time, does not pretend to know. They fall
under the exceptions to the third law, or are examples of somber-
plumaged birds that lay eggs like those to which reference has just
been made, in open and exposed nests. Possibly in the future such
circumstances as the facts that C. americanus lays “ glaucous-white”
eges. C. erythrophthalmus “ verditer-blue” ones, and Geococeyx * white”
ones may aid, slender as such clues usually are, in unraveling the true
affinities of this group, but our knowledge in such premises must then
be far more extensive than it is now.

The odlogy of ALCYONES, Pict, and STRIGES, ineach and every group,
affords strong support to the truth of the second law and its general
proposition, as does that of all our caprimulgine birds (CAPRIMULG1),
save Phaleonoptilus nuttalli, support the truth of the fifth law. The
writer will be obliged to have the opportunities to study the surround-
ings of the places of deposit of the eggs of a great many Common and
Nuttall’s Whip-poor-wills before expressing an opinion as to why the
first should lay an egg with a creamy-white shell, heavily marked with
browns and neutral tints, and the latter a white one. It is remarkable
in another light, for Steatornis and the owls lay white eggs.

Every variety of the means of protection exemplified in the case of
the eges of birds is to be seen in the TRocuHILI. In the first place, the
eges of Humming-birds are inconspicuous from the fact that they are
so small and few in number. The nests, also small, are frequently so
constructed as to perfectly harmonize with the surroundings. The nests
are often built in very inaccessible places, and so, difficult to be seen
COMPARATIVE OOLOGY OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS. 491

or reached on that account. The nests are sometimes so constructed
as to hide the eggs from view; in most instances the plumage of the
back of the incubating bird is in complete harmony with the environ-
ment of the nest. and, finally, the eggs are too small to be of any value
searcely to any egg-eating animal.

The somber-plumaged Swifts (CYPSELI), so far as is known of our
North American species, lay their four or five whité eggs in some cav-
ity where they are hidden from the general view (second law, last part),
and in this agreeing with some of the Swallows among the Passeres
that do likewise.

There are some curious and interesting examples and departures to
be seen in our great and compact group of passerine birds (PASSERES).
If we consider the Corvide to be the most highly organized family of
the suborder, and Corvus the highest genus, then in it we find the
species laying somewhat numerous, dark-colored and marked eggs
(C. corax); but these characters rapidly change directly within the
family, for Cyanocephalus lays only three or four eggs, which are white,
tinged with greenish and profusely spotted, and such characters are con-
tinued into the next group, the Stwrnide, where, however, they are
more prolific layers (S. vulgaris), and the eggs, as a rule, are not marked.
Then, passing by for the moment all the intermediate interrelated
families, we find in the Clamatores, Tyrannus, which lays but four or
five eggs, white, boldly and handsomely spotted with brilliant browns,
and yet, too, in that very family (Tyrannide) we discover Empidonax
minimus laying white eggs and unspotted. But just how a Raven
comes to lay dark-colored, heavily marked eggs, and a small Flycatcher
white ones I am inclined to believe we shall never exactly know. They
both in this particular come under the third law, the Raven under the
first part of it and the Flycatcher under the second.

The matter of coloration for protective purposes in this group would
hardly seem to account for the characteristic colors of the eggs of the
several families of passerine birds; nor, as I have heard it advanced,
has the light anything to do with it, although my own observations
lead me to think that crows are more frequently away from their nests
durmeg the period of incubation than are the smaller Passeres. They are
not as close sitters. Such a the ry, however, immediately becomes
untenable when we take species like Ampelis cedrorum and Petrochel idon
lunifrons into consideration. The first lays a dark-colored, heavily
marked egg in an open nest, the parent being a close sitter, while the
second, a Swallow, lays a white, thickly speckled egg in a covered
nest, and is not especially a close sitter. Other Swallows, which lay
pure white eggs in burrows (C. riparia) may fall under the operation
of the last part of the second law (see above). Affinity of the birds
again seems to have hardly anything to do with it in some eases, for
even among species very closely related the eggs are very different.
492 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM. 1892.

Good examples of this are seeu among our wren. , Troglodytida). These
birds all lay in places where their eggs are not exposed to view, yet
some of them lay pure white eggs, and others those which are very
dark and densely spotted. It is seen again in Harporhynchus, where
H. rufus lays whitish eggs speckled with brown, and its first cousin in
the same genus, H. crissalis, two emerald-green and unspotted eggs.
Such apparent anomalies would appear almost to defy a correct solu-
tion.

When we come to the Fringillide it is even still more difficult to
account for the peculiarities of the colors assumed by the shells of their
eges. Here we find species of the same genus, habits alike, nesting
alike, and the localities inhabited much alike, and yet laying very
different appearing eggs. For example, the Black-faced sage Sparrow
(A. bilineata), which lays whitish, unmarked eggs, and the California
sage Sparrow (A. bel/i), which lays greenish-blue speckled eggs.

Another interesting case is one that I have alluded to in my table
on the odlogy of the Passeres given above, and we find it among the
“Grosbeaks.” Those birds, so called, usually all lay handsomely
marked eggs; but the Blue Grosbeak (G. carulea) lays a plain egg
quite like the one laid by the Indigo Bird of the genus Passerina (P.
cyanea), only larger. Now, the Blue Grosbeak in plumage and other
characters is strikingly like an Indigo Bird, and I believe that this is
an instance pointing to the affinity of the two forms; indeed, I further
believe that the Blue Grosbeak is more nearly related to our Indigo
Bird than are some of the other species they have placed in the same
genus with the latter, as, for instanee, Passerina ciris and Passerina
versicolor, birds that lay pearly-white eggs speckled with brown of
two shades. When I say this I am also aware that the eggs of the
Indigo are occasionally speckled. In the popular mind the name
“Grosbeak” has given the impression that a number of birds in this
country so designated are much of the “same kind of species,” whereas
in reality the affinity in several instances is not so close as is generally
supposed. For example, Guiraca is structurally much more nearly
related to Passerina cyanea than it is to Habia, and still nearer than it
is to either Cardinalis or Pyrrhuloxia.

Finally, among our /cterid@ we find beautiful examples of that class
of. cases (fifth law) where the male bird is of very handsome plumage;
the female (the incubator) more or less somber in that respect; and
where the eggs, more or less exposed to view (oftener less or partially
concealed), are very remarkably and exquisitely decorated.

My examinations and studies of the odlogy of North American birds
have clearly shown me that we should strive more and more towards
correct and exact observation in such matters. It is especially needed
to have before the odlogist abundance of material, and they should
seek to employ a common nomenclature in the description of colors,
tints, hues, and shades. This is also applicable to the descriptions of
COMPARATIVE OOLOGY OF NORTH AMERICAN BIRDS. 493

forms and to the measurements of eggs. In regard to the last, or the
measurements of eggs, itis a matter of the very, highest importance to
the avian odlogist. Throughout the present paper I have frequently,
but not always, contrasted the measurements as given us by different
authorities, and it will be seen that the variance in statements in this
particular is often quite as great as are the descriptions of form and
color. The fact is the eggs themselves of the same species vary greatly
in size, and averages taken from large series constitutes the only kind
of data that can be safely relied upon. Nests and their environments
are deserving of the most painstaking studies and descriptions, and
frequent comparisons should be made of the nests of birds of allied
families and groups. The best odlogical works are those which are
fully illustrated with the most correct colored figures of eggs. In many
instances a full knowledge of the breeding habits, nesting, and odlogy
of birds will be of powerful assistance in determining the affinities of
avian types. From a scientific standpoint avian odlogy has accom-
plished much in the past and will undoubtedly do so in the future.

GEORGE PERKINS MERRILL. Stones for building and decoration. Wiley & Sons,
New York, 1891, 8 vo., 450 pp., with 11 full-page plates and 18 figures in text.

This work treats of matters of especial interest to architects and engineers, but the subject
is so handled as to make it practically a manual on the subject of stones in relation to their
use for constructive purposes.

The work opens with a brief chapter on the early history of stone working in the United
States; this is followed in Part 1 by chapters on the geographical distribution of stone of
various kinds in the United States; the minerals of building stones and the physical and
chemical properties of such stones as are utilized tor general construction and decorative
purposes.

Part 11 is given up to a systematic description of rocks, quarries, and quarry regions.
Each variety of stone is taken up in its turn, its composition, its origin, structure and gen-
eral adaptability for any form of work discussed, and the resources of each state and terri-
tory described in alphabetical order. ‘Lhe subjects treated are as follows: (1) the Steatites
or Soapstones; (2) the Serpentines or vord-antique Marbles; (5) Gypsum and Alabaster; (4)
Limestone and Dolomites, both marbles and the common varieties; (5) the Minor Ornamental
Stones; (6) the Granites; (7) the Porphyries or Porphyritic Felsites; (8) the Liparites; (9)
the Syenites; (10) the Diabases, Gabbros, Melaphyrs, and Basalts; (11) the Diorites and
Andesites; (12) the Gneisses and Schists; and (13) the Sandstones, Volcanic Tuffs, and
Slates.

Part 11 treats of the methods of quarrying and working; the machiues and implements
used in stone working; the weathering of building stone; the selection of stone for building
purposes, and the methods employed for the protection and preservation of stone from the
ravages of time.

Part Iv is made up of appendices, including extensive tables showing the qualities of stone
as indicated. by their crushing strength, weight, ratio of absorption, and chemical composl-
tion; a short table on. the prices of stone and the relative cost of dressing; a list of some of
the more important stone buildings in the United States, and the dates of their erection; a
bibliography of works on building stone; and concludes with a glossary of terms.

intellect and reason in insects, the author finding that as in man the higher intellectual devel-
opment and social organization have resulted from the long period of infantile dependence;
so in these insects the long period of larval dependence may be considered the primary cause
of their high intelligence and organization among insects.

This paper is an historical and descriptive work of the present knowledge of the Cambrian
group of rocks of the North American continent. Chapter 1 gives a statement of the prin-
ciples upon which the delineation of the group is made, with a few brief remarks upon the
nomenclature of the formation and a list of the books azd articles consulted in the prepa7a-
tion of the work. The second chapter contains a historical review of the geological and pale-
ontological work that has been done in all provinces in which the Cambrian group oceurs.
Chapter 1 embraces a record of the names that have been employed to designate the various
formations. Chapter Iv gives a summary of the present knowledge of the formations in each
of the four great geological provinces. A map showing the geographical distribution accom-
panies this chapter; also, one on which the sedimentation is illustrated by vertical columns
of strata. Chapter v deals with problems for investigation, and Chapter vi is devoted to the
study of criteria and principles used by authors in the correlation of the various parts com-
posing the Cambrian group.

Lester F. Warp. The Science and Art of Government.

Science, Xvul, New York, November 20, 1891, p. 281.

Defines government as the business agency of the nation, and the science and art of govern-
ment as those of conducting this business agency; hence lays stress on the importance of
some system of instruction on these subjects as branches of education. Instruction in public
administration and all governmental operations should form a prominent department of polit-
ical economy teaching.

Lester F.Warpb. Fossil Botany, being an Introduction to Palaeophytology from
the Standpoint of the Botanist. By H. Graf zu Solms-Laubach. Authorized
English translation by Henry E. F. Garnsey. Revised by Isaac Bayley.

Seience, xvul, New York, December 25, 1891, pp. 360, 361.

Review of the above work, in which it is compared with other works of its class, and is
shown to be of chief use in recording the opinion of the author on the nature of problemat-
ical vegetableremains. The translation is severely criticised for not having been brought down
to date, so that the author’s latest decision in such cases could be known.

Lester F. Warp. On the Glossopteris Flora. Remarks on a paper read by Dr.
August Rothpletz before the Geological Society at Washington, D. C., August 24,
1891, ‘‘On the Permian, Triassic, and Jurassic formations in the East Indian
Archipelago.”

Bulletin of the Geological Society of America, U1, 1891, p. 15.

The view was taken that the Glossopteris flora originating in the Paleozoic contemporane-
ously with the recognized Carboniferous flora, unlike the latter, and by virtue of its higher
organization, persisted into Mesozoic time. surviving the Perruan refrigeration, and becoming
modified, migrated northward, and reap peared at many points as the now well known Triassic
Rhetic and Odlitic Flora.

LESTER F. Warp. The Plant-bearing Deposits of the American Trias.

Bulletin of the Geoloyical Society of America, 11, 1891, pp. 23-31.

A critical analysis of the flora ‘of the American Triassic deposits, with a view to their
geologic correlation, both with one another and with those of other parts of the world. The ~
facts establish the substantial identity in age of the several beds of the Atlantic slope and a
close relation between these and those of New Mexico and Arizona; they also point to the
European Keuper, as displayed in Austria, Wurtemburg and Switzerland, as the nearest
homologue of the American Trias.

Lester F. Warp. Principles and methods of Geologic Correlation by means of
Fossil Plants. :

American Geologist, 1x, Minneapolis, January, 1892, pp. 34-47.

The law of homotagvis is tirst explained, with a historical account of the introduction of the
term. ‘The leading principles laid down are: First, that the great types of vegetation are
characteristic of the great epochs in geology, so that very imperfect material may establish
such epochs with certainty; second, that for deposits nearly related stratigraphically such
imperfect material is not adequate, but an ample series of good specimens is required; third,
that the accurate determination and classification of fossil plants is of purely biological im-
portance and not of geological importance. The methods employed in the determination of
the age of plant-bearing deposits are set forth in considerable detail.

Brief summary of the part read before the International Geological Congress of a paper
entitled ‘‘Principes et méthodes d’etude de la corrélation géologique au moyen des plantes
fossiles,’’ in which two of the principles were developed (see supra under date of August 28,
1891). Lhe paper was read in French, and a summary furnished in English, of which this is a
translation, made by Dr. S. I’. Emmons. For contents of the entire paper see last entry.

Lester F. Warp. The utilitarian character of Dynamic Sociology.

American Anthropologist, Vol.v, Washi gton, April, 1892, pp. 97-103.

This article is a defense of the science of dynamic sociology as expounded in the work of
that title against the charge of being a system of speculative philosophy devoid of practical
bearing on living issues. It is directed primarily to establishing broad principles looking to
the amelioration of the social condition, but does not claim to set forth any particular scheme
of social reform, that part belonging rather to the art of dynamic politics than to the science
of dynamic sociology. The general doctrine embodying these principles is that of meliorism,
which differs from philanthropy and humanitarianism as popularly understood by proceeding
according to the scientific method to establish the laws of social reorganization, such as will
result in improving and reforming society.
