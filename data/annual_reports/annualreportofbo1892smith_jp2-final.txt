UPON

THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM
DURING THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1892,

BY
G. BROWN GOODE,

Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution, in charge of U.S. National Museum.

A.—_GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

The report now presented relates to the operations of the National
Museum during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892.

The history of the origin and development of the National Museum
has been discussed in previous reports, both in the introductory pages
and in a paper published in the report. for 1891, entitled ‘‘ The Genesis
of the National Museum.”* It will therefore be sufficient for our pres-
ent purpose to repeat a few of the most essential facts.

The Smithsonian Institution was established by act of Congress in
1846. One of the provisions of the act was that all objects of art and
of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants,
and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging to the United
States, should be placed in the custody of the Smithsonian Institution.
As one of the results of this provision, the collections, both of ethno-
logical and natural history objects, made by the numerous Government
explormg expeditions, came into the possession of the Institution.
These, with the ** National Cabinet of Curiosities,” which was exhibited
in the Patent Office building, and which was transferred to the Smith-
sonian Institution in 1858, formed an important nucleus around which
thousands of other collections have since gathered. The‘ National
Cabinet of Curiosities ” was a name given to the collections of the
‘‘ National Institution,” which was organized six years before the act
creating the Smithsonian Institution had been passed.

The National Museum thus grew up under the eare of the Smith-
soman Institution, and the Secretary of the Institution was appointed

many years, but if was not until 1879 that an appropriation was made,
providing money for the construetion of a building especially intended
for the display of the national collections. This action of Congress
had been doubtless precipitated by the large increase made in the eo!
lections of the Government at the close of the Centennial Exhibition
in 1876. The building was completed in 1881, during which year the
collections were in part transferred to it from the Smithsonian building,
In the following year a careful estimate of the extent of the collections,
including the results of Government expeditions and gifts from private
individuals, showed that the total number of specimens in the National!
Museum was 193,362. At the end of June, 1892, this total had in-
creased to 3,223,941. Thus in one decade from what was practically
the date of occupancy of the Museum building, the collections have
increased sixteenfold. This result is certainly very: gratifying. The
Museum building is, however, very much overcrowded, and a new build-
ing is urgently needed. The attention of Congress has been frequently
called to this matter, but nothing has yet been done. If the present un-
satisfactory conditions are to exist much longer, such a rate of increase
in the collections will, as has been already pointed out, become exceed-
ingly embarrassing, and instead of endeavoring to interest people in
contributing to the national collections, it will soon become necessary
to discourage them from doing so. Indeed, this policy has already
been adopted in certain instances, and the National Museum has lost
control of several large and important collections. In the case of col-
lections made by various branches of the Government, the Museum is
obliged by law to receive them, having beei appointed by Congress
the custodian of such collections. The necessity of receiving these
makes it the more incumbent to decline offers trom private sourees.

During the year the Museum has accomplished much in connection
with the preparation of an exhibit for the World’s Fair, to be opened
in Chicago next May. In this the following departments of the Museum
will be represented: Mammals, Birds, Reptiles, Fishes, Insects, Marine
Invertebrates, Comparative Anatomy, Minerals, Physical Geology, Eth-
nology, American Prehistoric Pottery, Prehistoric Anthropology; as
well as several sections of the Department of Arts and Industries, viz..
Animal Products, Oriental Antiquities, Graphie Arts, and Musical
[ustruments.

The National Museum has been recognized as such by Congress for

PRINCIPAL SOURCES OF THE COLLECTIONS OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

B.—SPECIAL TOPICS OF THE YEAR.
INCREASE IN THE COLLECTIONS.

During the year the collections have been increased by the addition
of more than 228,000 specimens. These are, for the most part, contri-

of the Museum. The total number of specimens now in the collections
is 3,223,941.

INCREASE IN THE MUSEUM LIBRARY.

The number of publications added to the Musenmn library during the
year was 11,892, including 695 volumes of more than 100 pages, 1.642
pamphlets, and 8,486 parts of regular serials.

DECREASED EDITION OF THE REPORTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTI-

The edition of the Report of the Smithsonian Institution, including
that of the National Museum, has been reduced by the Fifty-second
Congress to 10,000 extra copies.

VISITORS.

The number of visitors to the Museum building during the year end-
ing June 30, 1892, was 269,825, and during the same period 114,817

PROPOSED ADDITIONAL MUSEUM BUILDING.

On January 21, 1892, the bill providing for a new Museum building
was introduced in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds. It was favorably reported by this committee
February 26, and passed the Senate April 14. The bill was referred to
the same committee in the House of Representatives, but was not
reported. It has now passed the Senate three times, but has failed of
action in the House.

DEVELOPMENT AND ARRANGEMENT GF THE EXHIBITION SERIES.

The overcrowded condition of the Museum building has prevented
any extensive changes in the arrangement of the exhibition halls.
Although a large number of interesting objects has been received during
the year in almost every department, it has not been possible to place
them on exhibition. They have, therefore, for the most part been stored
away until additional facilities for exhibition purposes shall have been
obtained. This can only be brought about by the passage by Congress
of an act authorizing the construction of an additional Museum build-
ing. In spite of the many disadvantages under which the work of the
Museum has been carried on during the year, considerable progress has
been made in connection with the rearrangement of the collections on
exhibition and in preparing specimens for installation, when it has been
possible to provide the necessary space.

REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

The curator of the department of ethnology has continued to mount
and label new specimens, which will be held in readiness for exhibition
when practicabie. A large number of specimens of aboriginal pottery,
consisting mainly of fragments collected by the officers of the Bureau
of Ethnology in the tide-water districts of Maryland and Virginia, have
been installed. In the section of graphic arts several important gaps
have been filled. Table-cases have been placed in the alcoves to aceom-
modate new specimens, and considerable progress has been made in the
substitution of printed for written labels. Several exhibits relating to
the development of the railroad and telegraph have been added to the
collections in the section of transportation and engineering. ‘The col-
lection of birds’ eggs has been carefully rearranged and relabeled,
and new insect-proof cases have been provided. Numerous illustra-
tions have been added to the systematic series of insects, making it
nearly complete. <A large collection of vertebrate fossils, from regions
in the west, secured by Prof. O. C. Marsh, in connection with his official
work for the U.S. Geological Survey, has been placed upon exhibition.
This collection is arranged in a wall-case especially constructed for it,
extending the entire length of the east side of the exhibition hall. The
collection of Cambrian and Ordovician fossils has been completed,
labeled, and placed upon exhibition. A large collection of Mesozoic
fossils has been received from the Geological Survey, and a part of it
has been placed upon exhibition. The herbarium has been practically
rearranged. New genus covers and genus labels have been substituted
for the old ones. An entirely new arrangement of the exhibition series
of fossil plants was begun during the. year. Heretofore, the plants
have been arranged with a view to illustrating the origin and develop-
ment of plant life, but it has been found desirable to substitute for this
a geological arrangement. A large and exceedingly valuable collection
of fossil plants has been presented by Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston,
Pa., and portions of it will be placed upon exhibition as oppor-
tunity offers. A considerable portion of the exhibition series in the
department of minerals has been remounted on ebonized blocks, and
the entire collection will soon be similarly provided for. Two large
mahogany cases have been provided for the exhibition of the gems and
semi-precious stones. This collection embraces 2,215 specimens. There
have been transferred to the exhibition hall about 1,800 specimens be-
longing to the exhibition and study series, which had accumulated in
the mineral laboratory. In the department of geology considerable
time has been devoted to the installation, in the south-west court, of the
economic series, Which may now be said to be in an approximately sat-
isfactory condition. The collection of ores, tin, nickel, manganese and
antimony are systematized, and temporary labels have, in most cases,
been prepared. The laying of new pavements in the south-west court
and west-south range necessitated the moving of all the tloor-cases,
and, incidentally, the rearrangement of the specimens.

K.—REVIEW OF WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC DEPARTMENTS.
DIVISION OF ANTHROPOLOGY.
ETHNOLOGY.

The work in this department for the past year has been chiefly con-
fined to the preparation of an exhibit for the World’s Columbian
Exposition. After consultation, it was decided to unite the work of
the Bureau of Ethnology, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, with that of the Department of Ethnology in the National Museum.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 15

Several valuable contributions to the collections were received dur-
ing the year. From the Cocopa, Yaki, Yuma, Papago, and other tribes
of Sonora, Mexico, and Lower California, Mr. Edward Palmer collected
for the Museum objects illustrating the industries of these tribes. Val-
uable material was also received from Mr. R. W. Bartleman, United
States legation, Caracas, Venezuela; Prof. Henry H. Giglioli, director
of the Royal Zodlogical Museum, Florence, Italy; Hon. Rounsevelle
Wildman, United States consul at Singapore, India; Prof. I. C. Rus-
sell, U. S. Geological Survey; Lieut. G. B. Harber, U. 8S. Navy, and
Mr. J. Walter Fewkes, Cambridge, Mass. The number of specimens
received during the year was 2,241, and the number of catalogue entries
1,243.

PREHISTORIC ANTITROPOLOGY.

The curator, Dr. Thomas Wilson, has continued his investigations of
the evidences of the remote antiquity of man in America, and in this
connection has made a special study of arrow-heads and spear-heads, or
knives. He was ealled upon to prepare exhibits for the Madrid Exposi-
tion and also for the World’s Columbian Exposition.

About 10,000 specimens were added to the collections of this depart-
ment during the year. The principal collections were received from
Edward Palmer; the Royal Zodlogical Museum, Florence, Italy; the
National Museum of Anthropology and Ethnology, Florence, Italy;
A. ©. Carlisle, De Witt Webb, the Bureau of Ethnology, Edward
Lovett, Henry Balfour, and others.

ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES.

This section is devoted to biblical archeology, and to the archeology,
history, languages, arts and religions of the people of western Asia
and Egypt, and is under the immediate charge of Dr. Cyrus Adler, as
assistant curator. During Dr. Adler’s recent visit to the east, in the
interests of the World’s Columbian Exposition, he obtained several
interesting objects. Two carefully made and well-preserved paper
molds of a piece of sculpture and a cuneiform inscription from Persep-
olis, have been received through the Department of State, from the
Hon. Truxton Beale, United States minister to Persia. The Telfair
Academy of Arts and Scienees of Savannah, Ga., has deposited a
portion of the collection of oriental books and manuscripts owned by
the late William Bb. Hodgson.

GRAPHIC ARTS.

The mest important additions of the year, as reported by Mr. 8. R.
Koehler, curator, are the illustrations of the half-tone relief screen-
process, and of a variety of the photo-aquatint intaglio process. — Inter-
esting specimens illustrating the advances made in chromo-collographie
process-work were given by Mr. EK. Bierstadt, of New York, and by the
16 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

J.B. Lippincott Company, of Philadelphia, About 200 specimens were
added during the year, the catalogue entries numbering 179,

FORESTRY.

Dr. B. E. Fernow, honorary curator, reports that the forestry collee-
tion has not received many additions during the year, The lack of
space for exhibition purposes has restricted his efforts toward develop-
ing the collection, and the bulkiness of the material makes if undesiva-
ble to add to itin the storage-rooms. The curator has, during the year,
prepared for publication: a list, with notes, of all the species of trees
found in the parks of Washington, D. ©.

AMERICAN ABORIGINAL POTTERY.

The operations of this department, as reported by Mr, Willian H.
Holines, honorary curator, consisted in the installation of a number of
specimens from the tide-water districts of Maryland and Virginia, and
the Gila Valley, Arizona. Among the principal contributions were
fragments of ancient Pueblo ware from Arizona, received from the U.S.
Geological Survey, and earthen vessels from Guadalajara, Mexico,
collected by Capt. John G. Bourke, U.S. Army. The estimated nun-
ber of specimens received during the year was 1,517,

PRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING.

Satisfactory progress is reported by the curator, Mr. J. EK. Watkins,
The accessions during the year are both valuable and interesting. They
include, among other things, an electrical locomotive, which made a
speed of 120 miles an hour at Laurel, Md., in 1889. The value of the
collection of telegraphic apparatus has been greatly enhanced through
the codperation of Mr. George C. Maynard, secretary of the American
Association of Inventors and Manufacturers. The collection showing
the development of the typewriting machine has also received several
important additions. Messrs. Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict have de-
posited a model of the Sholes & Glidden typewriter, invented in 1867,
and the original machine made trom this model. Mr. J.T. Richards,
assistant chief engineer of the Pennsylvania Railroad, presented a
model of the monument erected at Bordentown, N. J. in 1591, to com-
memorate the first movement by steam on a railroad in the State of
New Jersey, which occurred on November 12, 1831. Miss Katherine
Parsons, of Washington, deposited a sedan chair decorated with gold,
owned and used by the reyal family of France during the reign of Louis
x1v. The number of specimens received during the year was 265, the
catalogue entries numbering 161.

FOODS.

Prof. W. O. Atwater, the honorary curator, while in Europe during
the past fiscal year, spent considerable time in collating data available
for use in preparing labels, charts, diagrams, and plans for the food
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 17

collection in the National Museum. With this object in view he con-
ferred with a number of experts and investigators and visited museums
in which food collections are to be found. His recent study of the sub-
ject has strengthened his belief in the practicability of developing the
collection in the National Museum in such a manner as to make it of
ereat popular interest, to say nothing of its educational and scientific
value.

MATERIA MEDICA.

Dr. William 8S. Dixon, U.S. Navy, who assumed charge of this see-
tion in October, 1891, as honorary curator, states that the labeling of
the collection has been completed. The estimated number of specimens
received during the year was 207, the larger portion of which was from
the Royal Gardens at Kew, England. The catalogue entries numbered
55

DIVISION OF ZOOLOGY.

MAMMALS.

Mr. Frederick W. True, curator, states that the work in this depart-
ment has been seriously arrested by the necessary preparations for the
exhibit at the World’s Columbian Exposition.

Many foreign and domestic mammals were obtained from various
sources. Dr. W. L. Abbott sent a valuable collection of East African
mammals, and Mr. William Astor Chanler presented two excellent
mounted heads of giraffes from the same locality. Dr. Edgar A. Mearns,
U.S. Army, of the Mexican Boundary Commission, has sent in some
finely prepared specimens from the border. The President of the
United States deposited an armadillo which had been sent to him by
Mr. R. R. Skaggs, of Breckenridge, Tex. More than fifty mammals
were received from the National Zoélogical Park. The estimated num-
ber of specimens received during the year was 1,086.

BIRDS.

This department, under the charge of Mr. Robert Ridgway, as cura-
tor, shows a gratifying growth during the past year. The work of
transferring the specimens in the study collection to new trays and
‘vabinets has been vigorously pushed. The preparation of an exhibit of
birds for the World’s Columbian Exposition occupied a large share of
the curator’s time. The present state of the collection is more satis-
factory than during the preceding year, the arrangement of the speci-
mens being better adapted for the convenience of visitors. The esti-
mated number of specimens added was 5,610, involving 5,609 catalogue
entries.

BIRDS’ EGGS.

The honorary curator, Capt. Charles E. Bendire, U. S. Army, re-
ports that the collections are in excellent shape, having been carefully
overhauled and relabeled. The most important contribution during

18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

the year was made by Dr. William L. Ralph, of New York, consisting
of 1,630 eggs and 100 nests, several of the species being new to the
Museum collection. This is the most valuable ‘gift which has been
made to this collection for several years. In view of the large number
and great value of the contributions made by Dr. Ralph to the collec-
tion of birds’ eggs in the National Museum, it is understood that this
collection will not be drawn upon for purposes of exchange or dona-
tion. and that it will form an integral part of the national collection of
birds’ eggs. A number of specimens, gathered in the Death Valley
region of southern California, were received from the Department of
Agriculture. There were received during the year 3,094 specimens,
involving 840 catalogue entries.
REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS.

The curator, Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, reports that satisfactory pro-
gress has been made during the year. The work of installing, identi-
fying, and labeling the collections has been actively continued, and
preparations were made for an exhibit at the World’s Columbian Ex-
position. The most valuable and interesting collection of reptiles
received by the Museum since 1890 was the material sent by Dr. C.
Hart Merriam, through the U.S. Department of Agriculture. These
specimens, over 900 in number, were collected by the Death Valley
Expedition in 1891 from the desert regions of California, Nevada and
Utah. Inaddition to the collections mentioned in the last report, there
has been received a number of specimens from Mr. P. L. Jouy, obtained
by him in southern Arizona. Facilities for studying the collections
were afforded to Dr. O. P. Hay, of Irvington. Ind., and Dr. G. Baur,
of Worcester, Mass. In addition to his other duties the curator has
continued his work on the supplementary volume of the ‘‘ Nomenelator
Zoovlogicus.” There were 1,055 entries in the catalogue of the depart-
ment during the year, embracing 1,004 specimens.

FISHES.

The work accomplished has, in general, been similar to that of the
preceding year. The honorary curator, Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, has been
occupied with his duties in connection with the U.S. Fish Commission,
and the routine work has chiefly devolved upon Mr. Barton A. Bean,
assistant curator. Fifty-five sets of duplicate fishes were prepared for
distribution to educational establishments. Each set contained about
125 species, including both fresh and salt water forms. Valuable
collections were received from the U.S. Fish Commission, Prof. B. W.
fvermann, Mr. P. L. Jouy, and Mr. Charles W. Richmond. The
estimated number of specimens added to the collection was 1,906, the
catalogue entries being 5538.

VERTEBRATE FOSSILS.

A large collection of vertebrate fossils, secured by the honorary eura-
tor, Prof. O. C. Marsh, during his official work for the U. S. Geological
REPORT OF ASSISTAN' SECRETARY. 19

Survey, was received at the National Museum in July, 1891, and was
immediately placed upon exhibition. This is the first installment in
the Museum of the official collections of Professor Marsh. The speci-
mens have been well catalogued and arranged by the assistant curator,
Mr. F. A. Lucas. Another valuable collection, sent from New Haven
by the honorary curator in 1886, is still im storage, on account of lack
of room in the exhibition hall. Professor Marsh is now preparing two
memoirs, containing a full description of the more important specimens
lately deposited in the Museum. During the year, 1,124 catalogue en-
tries were made, and about 1,061 specimens were added to the collee-
tion.

MOLLUSKS (INCLUDING TERTIARY INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS).

Mr. William H. Dall, honorary curator, reports that a large amount
of time has been devoted to sorting, naming, cataloguing, and storing
the duplicate shells. The greater portion of them is now packed in
small boxes in the storage room, each specimen bearing its catalogue-
number. <A card-catalogue makes it possible to refer at a moment’s
notice to any duplicates in the collection. It has also been found nee-
essary to arrange and catalogue the drawings of shells. The report
on the ‘Later Tertiary of the United States,” though in type, will be
issued a few days too late to appear in the Bibliography of this year.
Considerable labor has been bestowed on the continuation of the report
on the “Florida Tertiary Mollusks,” for the Wagner Institute of Phila-
delphia. The most valuable contribution during the year was a collee-
tion of shells frem St. Helena, donated by Capt. W. H. Turton, of the
Royal Engineers, Chatham, England. Mr. Rounsevelle Wildman,
United States consul at Singapore, sent a collection of shells repre-
senting the principal marine forms of that vicinity. The number of
specimens added during the year was 6,225, the catalogue entries being
2,046,

INSECTS.

Prof. C. V. Riley, honorary curator, reports that a large amount
of time has been devoted to the study collections in the laboratory,
although important additions have been made to the systematic exhibi-
tion series. Among the more important accessions are: 400 specimens
of Heteroptera, received from Prot. A. L. Montandon, Bucharest, Rouma-
nia; a collection of Californian insects, from Mr. D. W. Coquillet, of
Los Angeles; material collected by Mr. A. Koebele during the Death
Valley expedition, in 1891, from the Department of Agriculture; 1,900
specimens of Lepidoptera (native and exotic) from Mr. G. Beyer, of New
York; and 57 specimens, embracing 27 species, mostly Coleoptera, from
Mr. Charles Dury, of Cincinnati, Ohio. Mr. Dury has also expressed
his willingness to contribute more material, and to aid in every way pos-
sible in increasing the value of the collection. In September, 1891, Prof.
20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

John B. Smith, entomologist of the New Jersey Agricultural Experi-
ment Station, was requested by the National Museum to compare the
North American Noctuids in several of the museums of Europe, while
visiting that country for purposes of study. In London he studied the
British Museum collections, and succeeded in identifying most of the
Walker types and the species described by Guenee. He also made
critical comparisons between the collections of Grote, Zeller and
Walker. At the museum in the Jardin des Plantes, Paris, he succeeded
in finding many of the insects studied by Guenee and Boisduval, which
form, atleast in part, the basis of their work ou the North American
Lepidoptera. At Berlin he examined the collections of the Royal Mu-
seum, including material which has been used as the basis of papers on
North American species. At Dresden he examined the Standinger
collections, and compared long series from the Siberian, Alaskan, Ice-
landie, and other Arctic faunal districts. In the course of these studies
Professor Smith collected considerable information for publication in the
Proceedings of the National Museum, and he also sueceeded in obtain-
ing from Mr. W. Schaus, jr., who has collected extensively in Mexico
and South America, a promise to present to the Museum his coliection,
which is very large and contains many of the types described in the
Biologia Centrali Americana, About 16,500 specimens were added to
the collection during the year, the catalogue entries numbering 295,

MARINE INVERTEBRATES.

Mr. Richard Rathbun, honorary curator, states that considerable
progress has been made during the year in the study of the collections
of this department. ‘The accessions of the year show a marked increase
both in number and in extent and value. The U.S. Fish Commission
has transferred the collections of the Albatross in the North Pacific
Ocean, and important collections made by the Lish Hawkand the Gram-
pus have also been received. Some additions have been made to the
exhibition series; but little can be dene in this direction until more
space can be provided... Mr, J. E. Benedict, assistant curator, has con-
ducted experimental work witha view to the manufacture of some plas-
tic substance suitable for reproductions of soft substanees. The prepa-
ration of an exhibit representing the families of Ameriean marine in-
vertebrates for the World’s Columbian Exposition has progressed.
Mr. Benedict and Miss Rathbun have completed a monograph of the
genus Panopeus, and the latter has prepared catalogues of the Peri-
ceride and Matide. These will be published in the Proceedings of the
U.S. National Museum. The department has received the assistance of
several specialists in the determination of recently acquired material.
The number of catalogue entries during the year is 1,318. The number
of specimens received is 7,120.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 21
COMPARATIVE ANATOMY.

The work of the year has consisted largely in the preparation and
arrangement of osteological material by the assistant curator, Mr. F. A.
Lucas. The most important accession of the year was the skeleton of
a young sperm whale, obtained through the courtesy of the Life-Saving
Service from the station at Green Run Inlet. The U.S. Fish Commis-
sion contributed valuable material. The increasing care of the collec-
tions has prevented any special researches. The exhibition series is in
good condition. During the year 574 specimens were added to the eol-
lection, and a large number were transferred to the department of
vertebrate fossils.

INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS (PALEOZOIC).

Mr.C. D.Waleott, honorary curator, has necessarily devoted the greater
portion of his time to work connected with the U.S. Geological Survey,
with which he is associated. The principal accessions during the year
were received from the Geological Survey. The collection of Cambrian
and Ordovician fossils was placed upon exhibition.

In the latter part of 1891 the attention of the curator was called to
an unworked collection of Lower Carboniferous crinoids and associated
invertebrates from Crawfordsville, Ind., comprising specimens brought
together by Prof. Frank Bradley, and presented by Prof. O. C. Marsh
to the Yale University Museum, and others gathered by the Rey.
D. ‘A. Bassett upon his farm at Crawfordsville, and alse the property of
the Yale Museum. The National Museum possessed at that time but
one or two small specimens from this formation, and plaster casts of
several others. The curator urged the extreme desirability of securing
a full representation from this classic locality of North American Lower
Carboniferous fossils. After some correspondence with Prof. Marsh,
with this end in view, Mr. Charles E. Beecher, of the Yale Museum,
submitted a proposition, offering to give to the National Museum a
large number of the Bassett and Bradley fossils, provided the Museum
would be willing to work up the collection and supply the necessary
tools. This proposition Was accepted, and the task of working up the
collection was begun at New Haven, the university kindly furnishing
abundant laboratory room and every facility for properly carrying on
the work. The material, as it was received at New Haven, weighed
two tons, and contained between 3,000 and 4,000 specimens, many of
them, however, being duplicates. In addition to the single erinoids
and groups of crinoids upon slabs, the coilection meludes fossil brachio-
pods, corals, and other invertebrates. It is estimated that the value of
the share which will come to the National Museum will exeeed double
the amount of money expended in working up the collection. The
material is very showy and attractive, and will form a valuable addi-
tion to the exhibition series.
22 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

The number of specimens received during the year was about 569,
involving 95 catalogue entries.

INVERTEBRATE FOSSILS (MESOZOIC).

Dr. C. A. White, honorary curator, reports gratifying progress dur-
ing the year. The most important accession was received from the
U.S. Geological Survey. This embraced a large number of specimens,
including some of the most important paleontological material studied
by members of the Survey. There were 419 catalogue entries during
the year, representing about 3,099 specimens.

DIVISION OF BOTANY.
FOSSIL PLANTS.

Prof. Lester F. Ward, honorary curator, states that the work has
been chiefly confined to the installation and care of specimens. There
were added to the collection more extensive and valuable accessions
than in any previous year. The most important was the collection of
fossil plants, presented by Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa. This
collection munbers 100,000 specimens and is of world-wide reputa-
tion. Prof. F. H. Knowlton continued during the year his study of
the Laramie flora, and identified a large collection of plants from the
Bozeman (Montana) coal fields. The “ Flora of the Dakota Group,” by
the late Prof. Leo Lesquereux, was printed during the year.

RECENT PLANTS.

Dr. George Vasey, botanist of the Department of Agriculture, and
honorary curator of the department of botany in the National Museum,
reports that the growth of the National Herbarium has been steady,
although the percentage of increase has not been as great as in the
preceding year. The collections have been practically rearranged and
new labels provided. The duplicate specimens were threatened with
destruction by insects, and it became necessary to poison them to pre-
vent further damage. New specimens are now treated in this inanner
when they first arrive. Considerable time has been spent in the prep-
aration of a card-catalogue of all the botanical works in the libraries
to which this department has access. Among the more important ac-
cessions were the collections made by Mr, F. V. Coville, assistant bot-
anist of the Department of Agriculture (2,150 specimens); Mr. G. C.
Nealley (1,709 specimens from Texas and Arizona); Edward Palmer
(3,521 specimens from Mexico and Arizona); Mr, J. N. Sandberg (15,191
specimens from Minnesota and idaho), and Mr. J. M. Holzinger (2,530
specimens froin the United States and Europe). There were 512 cata-
logue entries made during the year, embracing about 53,384 specimens.
Of the total number of accessions, 41 were transmitted directly to the
National Museum, the remainder being received by the Department of
Agriculture.

DIVISION OF GEOLOGY.
MiNERALS.

Prof. F. W. Clarke, of the U. S. Geological Survey, continues to act
as honorary curator of this department, with Mr. W. 8. Yeates as as-
sistant curator. The preparation of an exhibit of minerals and gems
for the World’s Columbian Exposition has occupied considerable time.
A large part of the systematic exhibition series has been remounted on
ebonized blocks, and the specimens in the reserve series have been
transferred to the exhibition hall. It is intended to provide species
labels for the systematic exhibition series, indicating the chemical com-
position of each species, its crystallographic form, hardness, specific
gravity, and different varieties with their characteristics. The sys-
tematic duplicate series was thoroughly overhauled and reclassified.
Among the more important accessions were twenty-five boxes of min-
erals, presented by Mr. Joseph Willcox, of Philadelphia; several speci-
mens of minerals from Connecticut, and a crystal of spangolite from
Tombstone, Ariz., presented by Prof. 8. L. Penfield, of Yale College;
four specimens of ornamental stones and one specimen of churehite,
from Mr. Clarence S. Bement, of Philadelphia; two cut specimens of
transparent spessartite, from Mr. Ira R. Allen, of Fair Haven, Vt.;
three specimens of native gold from the Potomac mine, Montgomery
county, Md., presented by Mr. A. B. Russ, of Washington, D.C. Sev-
eral lots of minerals were also received from the U.S. Geological Sur-
vey. There have been 4,121 specimens added to the collection during
the year, the catalogue entries numbering 1,404.

GEOLOGY.

Mr. G. P. Merrill, curator, reports that the work in this department
has been largely confined to the arrangement and classification of mate-
rial, and the preparation of about 200 sets of Specimens for distribu-
tion to educational establishments. Several expeditions for collecting
specimens were made during the summer and autumn by the curator,
and by Mr. W. H. Newhall, his assistant. The work of preparing an
exhibit for the World’s Columbian Exposition was entered upon, and
the curator visited Arizona, New Mexico, Virginia, Tennessee, Ken-
tucky, Indiana, aud Missouri, collecting a large amount of volcanic and
cave material. The contributions made by Mr. G. F. Becker, of the
U.S. Geological Survey, Mr. W. B. Robertson, of Saltville, Va., Mr. EF.
W. Crosby, and Mr. Henry G. Bryant were among the most important
received during the year. The catalogue entries numbered 1,045,
embracing more than of 4,000 specimens.

F.—REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK.
REGISTRATION AND DISTRIBUTION.

In the report of Mr. S. C. Brown, registrar, it is stated that the total
number of packages of all kinds received during the year is 36,702—an
ae: REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

a

increase of 3,016 over the previous year. The entries covering these
receipts number 2,970, of which 980 consisted of specimens and 918 of
supplies intended for the National Musewn. The record of outgoing
packages for the year embraces 1,408 entries, covering 2,342 packages
of various kinds. The storage register shows that during the year 57
packages have been withdrawn from storage by officers of the Museum,
and that 290 packages have been temporarily placed in storage. Dur-
ing the year 98 transportation bills have been subdivided and copied,
and 184 letters written relating to the transmission of packages through
custom-houses and to railroad and express companies. In addition,
546 notices of transmission have been sent out. The total number of
accessions, 7. é., lots of specimens received for the National Museum,
during the year was 1,557. In addition, there were received 527 pack-
ages of specimels sent for examination and report. - The disposition of
the accessions among the departinents in the Museum is shown in one
of the appendices to the accession list, which constitutes Section v of
this report.

The distribution records show that during the year 172 packages, con-
taining 16,616 specimens.were sent out. These sendings included speci-
mens given, lent, sent in exchange, and returned to the owners.

LIBRARY.

Mr. N. P. Scudder, assistant librarian, has furnished the following
statement in regard to the operations of the Museum library during
the year:

The number of publications added to the library is 11,892 (693. vol-
umes of more than 100 pages, 1,642 pamphiets, and 8,486 parts of
regular serials). Of these, 297 volumes, 774 pamphlets, and 6,363 parts
of serials have been retained for the use of the Museum from the
accessions of the Smithsonian Institution, the remainder being obtained,
as usual, by gift. exchange, and purchase.

During the year, 6,094 books were borrowed from the library, of
which 1,832 had been returned at the close of the year. The books
assigned to the sectional libraries are counted with those borrowed,
hence the great excess of these over those returned. During the year,
243 orders for books were sent to the Library of Congress. There have
been added 2,235 titles to the card-catalogue by authors, and 1,989
cards were added to the subject-catalogue, making a total of 3,827
cards in this catalogue.

- SECTIONAL LIBRARIES.

The designations of the sectional libraries now organized, and the
number of books assigned to each, are as follows:

Administration.—141 volumes, 74 parts, and 81 pamphlets.

Aéronautics.—s volumes and 29 parts.

Astronomy.—b63 volumes, 522 parts, and 19 pamphlets.

Birds.—589 volunies, 155 parts, and 56 pamphlets.

Editor.—656 voluines, 229 parts, and 46 pamphlets.

Ethnology.—379 volumes, 99 parts, and 29 pamphlets.

Fishes.—52 volumes, 19 parts, and 10 pamphlets.

Geology.—T17 volumes, 169 parts, and 455 pamphlets.
32 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Insects. —492 volumes, 310 parts, and 210 pamphlets.

Mammats.—210 volumes and 295 pamphlets.

Marine invertebrates. —89 volumes and 46 pamphlets.

Materia medica.—251 volumes, 97 parts, and 23 pamphlets.

Mesozoic fossils.—30 volumes and 2 pamphlets.

Mineralogy.—(A) 242 volumes, 63 parts, and 19 pamphlets; (B) 89 volumes, 24
parts, and 78 pamphlets.

Mollusks and cenozoic fossils.—110 volumes, 275 parts, and 89 pamphlets.

Oriental archwology.—311 volumes, 157 parts, and 157 pamphlets.

Plants. —396 volumes, 302 parts, and 335 pamphlets.

Prehistoric anthropology.—79 volumes, 40 parts, and 42 pamphlets, in addition to
the Rau Memorial Library of 1,609 titles.

Reptiles.—16 volumes, 7 parts, and 4 pamphlets.

Transportation.—121 volumes, 189 parts, and 2 pamphlets.

Owing to the failure of Congress to appropriate any money for bind-
ing, it has been impracticable to bind any of the books belonging to the
Musewn library. There are at least 1,500 volumes which need binding,
some being of great value.

In several instances it has been found necessary, in order to preserve
the books, to withdraw them from circulation, while in other instances
where the work of curators would not permit this, the books are being
worn out by constant though careful use.

Of the Smithsonian deposit 500 volames were bound upon application
to the Librarian of Congress.

PUBLICATIONS.

The public demand for the publications of the Museum is constantly in-
creasing, but comparatively few applications can be favorably considered
on account of the very limited appropriation for printing. Some years
ago both the Proceedings and Builetins of the Museum were reprinted
by the Smithsonian Institution in its Miscellaneous Collections. By this
means it was possible to supply a large number of libraries with these
publications. The Institution has, however, for several years ceased to
do this. The entire distribution of these publications now falls upon
the Museum, and with an edition of only 3,000 copies of the Proceed-
ings and of the Bulletins, it is evident that a large number of deserving
libraries must be excluded from the mailing-list, as well as many stu-
dents to whom these volumes would be of great assistance.

BULLETIN OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Of the Bulletin, Parts A to E of No. 39 have been issued. This Bulle-
tin is published in separate pamphlets, each one containing instrue-
tions to collectors in some special department of natural history. The
manuscripts of Parts IF (Directions for Collecting and Preserving In-
sects) and G@ (Instructions for Collecting Mollusks, and other Useful
Hints for the Conchologist) have been transmitted to the Public Printer.
It is hoped that this series of instructions to collectors will prove of
service to naturalists and others engaged in making natural history
collections. It is probable that before very long additional contribu-
tions to this series will be made, containing suggestions to collectors in
other branches of natural history.

In addition, No. 41, Bibliography of Dr. Charles Girard, and No. 42,
A Preliminary Descriptive Catalogue of the Systematic Collections in
Eeonomic Geology and Metallurgy in the National Museum, by Mr. F. P.
Dewey, have been published. The manuscript of Bulletin No. 40, Bib-
liography of George N. Lawrence, by Dr. G. Brown Goode, has been
temporarily withdrawn.

In order to meet special requirements in connection with the deserip-
tion of certain valuable collections in the National Museum, it has been
decided to issue, from time to time, monographsof collections in quarto
form. This series of publications will be known as the ‘“ Special Bulle-
tin.” During the year, No. 1 of this series, entitled ‘+ Life Histories of
North American Birds,” has been issued. This book has been prepared
by Charles E. Bendire, U. S. Army, honorary curator of the department
of birds’ eggs in the U.S. National Museum. Itis based largely upon
the collections in the Museum. The preparation of this book was com-
menced in aecordance with the wishes of Professor Baird. The present
volume relates only to land birds. Itis hoped that before long Capt.
Bendire will be enabled to prepare for publication subsequent vol-
umes relating to the same general subject.

A large number of papers upon scientific subjects has been published
by officers of the Museum and other specialists. These are, for the
most part, based on collections in the museum, and are referred to by
title in the Bibliography, constituting Section rv of this report. The
authors of these papers are seventy-five in number, thirty-two of whom
are connected with the Smithsonian Institution or the National Museum.
The papers referred to in the Bibliography number 238, and relate to
the following subjects:

HEATING AND LIGHTING.

The unexpended balance of the appropriation for heating and light-
ing and electric and telephonic service for 1891, held to meet unpaid
liabilities for that year, was $842.34. Bills have been youchered and
paid from this balance as follows: $46.20 for coaland wood; $74.75 for
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 59

gas; $200.25 for telephones; $384.95 for electric supplies; $52.75 for
electric work; $20 tor rental of call boxes; $81.79 for heating supplies,
making a total of $840.69, and leaving an unexpended balance July 1,
1892, of $1.65.

From the appropriation of 812,000 for heating and lighting for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, the disbursements are as follows:

For salaries or compensation, $5,218.93; for special or contract serv-
ices, $20; for coal and wood, $3,365.85; gas, $1,360.51; telephones,
$622.65; electric work and supplies, $124.53; rental of call boxes, $100;
heating repairs, $329; heating supplies, $455.62; making a total of
$11,575.09, and leaving an unexpended balance July 1, 1892, of $424.91,
to meet outstanding liabilities.

From the appropriation of 85,000 for removing decayed wooden floors
in the Museum building, and replacing them with artificial stene pave-
ment, and for the purchase of slate for covering trenches containing
heating and electrical apparatus, the expenditures for materials and
services to July 1, 1892, are $4,474.64, leaving on that date an unex-
pended balance of $525.36 on hand to meet outstanding liabilities.

With a view to securing the best pavement possible, as well as for
the purpose of obtaining for future guidance a practical knowledge of
the merits of the artificial stone flooring made by different bidders, three
proposals, which did not vary materially in amount, were accepted. It
will require a greater length of time than has yet elapsed to pronounce
upon the relative merits of these pavements, but they have already
proved themselves far more satisfactory than the wooden floors for
which they were substituted, and it is hoped that it will soon be possi-
ble to put down the same or some equally durable form of pavement in
other parts of the Museum.

From the appropriation of $5,000 for removing the old boilers under
the Museum hall in the Smithsonian building, and replacing them with
new ones, making necessary alterations and connections of steam-heat-
ing apparatus, and covering pipes with fire-proof material, the expen-
ditures are as follows: Alteration of pipes, etc., $121; purchase of two
new boilers, $2,769; black pipe, ete., $48.47; making a total expendi-
ture of $2,958.47, and leaving on hand July 1, 1892, an unexpended
balance of $61.55 to meet liabilities still outstanding.

The Museum is under obligation to Commodore Melville, U. S. Navy,
Chief of the Bureau of Steam Engineering, Navy Department, who, in
July, 1891, at the request of the Acting Secretary, appointed a board
of engineer officers to prepare specifications and examine bids for the
new steam-heating apparatus. The Museum was thus enabled to profit
by the skill and experience of Passed Assistant Engineer Baird and
Assistant Engineer Leopold, the officers designated to serve on this
board. The practical working of the steam-heating apparatus has
since demonstrated the wisdom of the board in the preparation of the
test questions and specifications submitted to the bidders, and of the
60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Museum in its final approval of the proposal of the firm to which the
work of putting in the new heating apparatus was intrusted.

In addition to the work mentioned in the detailed list, much has been
accomplished in the way of general repairs. The carpenter’s shop has
been extended to make room for two lathes; the storage shed south of
the Smithsonian building has been enlarged and the roof tinned; the
old paint shop has been reconstructed for use by the special employés
detailed for service in connection with the World’s Columbian Expo-
sition; steam pipes have been furnished with casing; the old and worn-
out fixtures connected with the plumbing of the Smithsonian building
have been removed and replaced with new; much necessary repairing
has been done to the roofs of both buildings; skylights have been re-
paired, painted, and glazed; windows have been glazed, painted, and
furnished with weather strips; the walls in both buildings have been,
to a considerable extent, painted and calcimined, and necessary repairs
in general have been made within the means available for this purpose.

By the laying of the asphalt walk on the west side of the Museum,
and the consequent raising of the grade in that locality, it was found
that the surface water, being turned toward the wall of the building
and having no way of escape, frequently collected there to the depth
of severalinches. Permission was accordingly asked of Col. Ernst, U.S.
Army, the Superintendent of Public Buildings and Grounds, to pro.
vide for the drainage of this area by the laying of a small sewer to be
connected with the large one from the Smithsonian building. ‘The re-
quired permit having been issued, the work was done by the Museum
force, With materials already available for this purpose.

The buffaloes were removed from the shed south of the Smithsonian
building to their new quarters in the Zodlogical Park on the 20th of
July, 1891. The building thus vacated was immediately renovated
and remodeled for the use of the painters.

The number of requests for the use of the lecture hall by the scien-
tific societies of Washington and the country has not varied materi-
ally, the average being about twoa month. In some parts of the year,
however, the hall is required in this way much more frequently, so
that its proper preparation as aroom of public assembly becomes an
item of considerable importance in connection with the work of the
Museum force. The Geographic Society used the room for lectures on
five different dates in April, 1892, and in this month, as usual, the
annual session of the National Academy was held here for four days,
April 19 to 22. At the time of the annual sessions of the various
scientific associations of the country, which are often held in the hall
of the Museum, it generally becomes necessary, as in the case of the
Academy, to prepare and set apart some of the smaller rooms of the
building also for the meetings of the committees, a courtesy which is
always cheerfully accorded. In addition to these meetings, held in
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY, 61

the lecture hall of the Museum. the National Art Association was
given permission to use the room in the Smithsonian building, known
as the chapel, for an art exhibition during the two weeks beginning
May 16, 1892.

It should also be mentioned that various scientific and educational
associations avail themselves more and more frequently of the privilege
of using the oxyhydrogen lantern belonging to the Museum, for the
purpose of illustrating their lectures, which, if not given in the lecture
hall, are, as a rule, held at the Columbian University or the Cosmos
Club. The lantern is always used under the direction of a skilled oper-
‘ator connected with the Museum, and, except on oecasions for which
the use of the lecture hall has been granted by the Regents of the Insti-
tution for the Washington meetings of national scientific and edu-
vational societies, the expenses incurred for gas, etc., are paid by the
society under the direction of which the lecture is given. Among the
bodies which have availed themselves of the use of the lantern during
this year are the Association of Agricultural Colleges, the Association
of Agricultural Chemists, the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, the Geological Society of America, the International
Geological Congress, the Philosophical Society, the Biological Society,
the American Folk-Lore Society, the Cosmos Club, and the Corcoran
School of Art.

In compliance with the request of the Department of State, and in
accordance with the act of Congress making an appropriation for the
purpose, preperations were begun in June, 1892, for an exhibit by the
National Museum at the Columbian Historical Exposition, to be held
in Madrid, in commemoration of the four hundredth anniversary of the
discovery of America.

Preparations for the exhibit of the Museum at the World’s Columbian
Exposition, commenced last year, have been prosecuted vigorously.
As the act of Congress making the appropriation for this exhibit pro-
vides for no clerical service, the work of this nature required for the
Exposition has been performed by the Museum force, often, of course, at
the expense of service beyond the regular departmental hours. While
the necessity for extra work is always cheerfully complied with, it is
but proper to put on record the fact that there exists a gradually in-
creasing need for a permanent addition to the clerical force.

CORRESPONDENCE AND REPORTS.

The work of this office continnes under the direction of Mr. R. I.
Geare. The force of assistants in July, 1891, consisted of 2 stenograph-
ers, 2 typewriters, 2 indexers, 1 accession clerk, 1 copyist, and 1 mes-
senger. During the year the work increased considerably, and before
the close of the year it had been found necessary to obtain the services
62 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

of an additional clerk. In May, 1892, the distribution of Museum pub-
lications was added to the work of the office, and in the months of May
and June there were partially distributed Dr. W. L. Abbott’s Catalogue
of Ethnological Collections in the U.S. National Museum from Kili-
ina-njaro, East Africa (published in the Report of the National Museum
for 1891), and a paper by Dr. G. Brown Goode, entitled Museums of the
Future (published in the Report of the National Museum for 1890).
During the year the routine work connected with the distribution of
specimens has also been attended to in this office. The correspondence
of the Museum (including the acknowledgment of gifts, loans, and ex-
changes, the preparation of reports upon material sent for examination,
and replies to requests for technical information of all kinds), and the
preparation, editing, and proof-reading of the Annual Report of the
Museum, constitute the principal work of the office.

The routine work performed in the case of each letter received is as
follows: The date of its receipt at the Museum is stamped upon it, after
which the proper reference is indorsed upon it.* It is then charged to
the person to whom it is referred, and inclosed in a wrapper, on which
is written the name and address of the writer, the subject of the inquiry;
and the name of the person to whom it is referred. On its return from
the referee a reply is prepared, which, with the original letter, is trans-
mitted to the Secretary, Assistant Secretary, or Curator-in-charge, for
signature. It is then detached, marked for filing, and a labelis attached
giving the name and address of the writer, the subject, and date of
letter. The letters written are copied in the current number of the
appropriate series of letter-books. All letters written are indexed in
the letter-books, and also on cards prepared for the purpose. These
cards are filed alphabetically, and thus, at a glance, the amount of cor-
respondence with any person, including the date of each letter, can be
ascertained. A cross-reference is also prepared under every name
mentioned in each letter written, and filed alphabetically. By this
means a clew is often furnished to correspondence which it would other-
wise be difficult to find.

A record is kept, in card-catalogue form, of all offers of specimens
which are not at the time accepted, whether offered as gifts, loans, in
exchange, or for sale. The possibility of bringing together in a mo-
ment all offers relating to material ina given department of the Museum,
has frequently proved very useful, and has saved many hours’ work in
examining’ the letter-files.

“A large proportion of the letters does not require reference, in which case the
intermediate steps of the routine are omitted,

BUILDINGS AND LABOR—POLICE AND PUBLIC COMFORT.

The report submitted by Mr. Henry Horan, superintendent of build-
ings, shows that the force of laborers and mechanies has been busily
employed under his supervision, assisted by Mr. Charles A. Steuart.
The following abstracts from his report indicate some of the principal
items of work the force has accomplished:

1891.

July.—The buffaloes were removed from their quarters south of the Smithsonian
Institution to the Zodlogical Park, and the shed thus vacated was remodeled for use
asa paint shop. The Jackson sarcophagus was removed from the west hall of the
Museum, and placed on the parking north of the building.

August.—The animal pens south of the Smithsonian building were removed. The
Museum was opened to visitors on the evening of the Zist, and also of the 28th, on
which occasions it was lighted by electricity.

September.—The American Pomological Association held a fruit exhibition in the
northeast court from the 18th to the 25th, inclusive. The Japanese house, which
has been in storage for some months, was set up in the west hall.

October.—The work of reconstructing the wall-cases on the west side of the north
hall was completed. The remainder of the living animals were removed to the
Zoological Park on the 24th.

November.—The laborers were employed in removing the exhibition cases prepara-
tory to the work of tearing up the floors in the west-south and north-west ranges,
for the purpose of laying granolithic pavements. Two heavy slabs of granite and
sandstone were fastened to the wall in the west-southrange. The work of putting
in place the new boilers for the Smithsonian building was commenced on the 234d.

December.—The west end of the Smithsonian building was kalsomined and painted.
The cases were removed from the lecture hall, and the room was prepared for the
meetings of the American Forestry Association, the American Historical Association,
and the American Geographic Association. Granolitbic pavements were laid in the
tank room, the photographic laboratory, and the north-east court, involving a large
amount of work by the laborers in removing cases and cleaning.

1892.

January.—Both buildings were suitably draped in respect to the memory of Gen.
M. C, Meigs, a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution, who died January 2. The
64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

work of preparation of floors, preliminary to the laying of new pavements by the con-
tractors, was continued during January and February.

February.—Shelves were placed at the west entrance, in order to provide storage
room for the property clerk. The wall-case on the south side of the north hall was
altered.

March.—A large number of exhibition cases were cleaned, the locks overhauled,
and the doors eased. The preparation of the lecture-hall for meetings and lectures
required the attention of the laborers several times during the month. It was found
that the weight of the exhibition cases rendered the bird gallery in the Smithsonian
building unsafe, and some of the cases were accordingly removed.

April.—An electric light was hung at the east entrance of the Museum. Skilled
laborers were engaged in repairing the tiling around the building. Repairs were
made in the chapel of the Smithsonian building.

May.—The boiler room in the Smithsonian building was thoroughly cleaned and
whitewashed, and new window frames were placed in the coral hall. The chapel
was prepared for an exhibit by the National Art Association. An electric alarm was
placed in the Joseph Francis case, for the purpose of protecting the collection.
Sewer traps were placed at the foot of the steps at the northwest entrance of the
Museum and in front of the door to the World’s Fair carpenter-shop, the work being
done by Museum laborers. An addition was made to the south end of the Museum
carpenter-shop, to provide room for two lathes.

June.—A number of exhibition cases were brought from storage in the Armory
building and prepared for shipment to the Madrid Exposition. The large lathe
was removed from the engine room to the carpenter shop. The shed at the west
end of the Smithsonian building was extended to provide room for the storage of
cases, etc. The work on the new return pipes of the Smithsonian building was com-
pleted on the 17th instant, so far as it was possible to carry them this fiscal year. A
concrete walk was laid in the area at the south door of the Smithsonian, the work
being done by laborers from the Museum force. Extensive repairs were made in the
public-comfort rooms.

THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS,.
TAXIDERMISTS.

The force of taxidermists, under the charge of Mr, William Palmer,
has been engaged, the greater part of the time, in the preparation of an
exhibit for the World’s Columbian Exposition. The entire exhibition
series of mamials has been examined and cleaned, and a number of
mounted specimens have been repaired and placed upon new stands.
The skins in pickle have been overhauled. The total number of skins
received from all sources during the year is 492. Of this number 368
have been worked up. The total number of skins on hand at the end of
the year is 452. For the World’s Fair exhibit, 181 mammals have been
mounted and finished, including 6 Rocky Mountain sheep, 5 Newfound-
land caribou, 3 Alaskan caribou, 3 Arizona deer, 4 armadillos, 5 badg-
ers, 8 Californian sea lions, a male walrus, from Walrus Island, Bering
Sea, and an African crocedile. A series of experiments have been suc-
cessfully made with a view to preparing a composition for making casts
of reptiles. Experiments, with good results, have also been made in
preserving leaves and plants for use as accessories in groups of ani-
mals.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT SECRETARY. — 6D
OSTEOLOGICAL PREPARATOR,

The greater part of the time of Mr. F. A. Lucas, the osteological
preparator, has been devoted to matters other than those pertaining
directly to his department. Important work has, however, been ac-
complished in the preparation of skulls and skeletons for the study
series. Several weeks were spent in the preparation of the skeleton
of a young sperm whale. A summary of the work accomplished is
given in the following table :

Mr. A. Zeno Shindler has been engaged in painting life-size casts for
the Department of Ethnology, including among others the figure of an
Una Indian, a group of five Kiowa children at play,an Eskimo woman
at play, an Eskimo woman and child, Sitting Bull, and a Labrador
woman and child. Mr. Shindler has also continued the work of paint-
ing in oil representations of the various races of man, and has made a
copy from a photograph of a painting of Pocahontas, dated 1616,

G.—ACCESSIONS.

The number of accessions received during the year is 1,557* (acces-
sions Nos. 24528 to 25884, inclusive). These accessions embraced
228,249} specimens, giving an average of about 168 specimens to each
accession. This increase over the number of accessions received last
year, as Shown in the foot-note, is the more conspicuous, as no effort
has been made to invite contributions on account of lack of space for
exhibition or storage. A large proportion of the specimens received
will, for this reason, have to remain in the boxes in which they were
shipped to the Museum.

A tabulated statement, showing the number of accessions to the
Museum annually since 1881 (the first year of occupancy of the Museum
building) is here presented :

IL—EXPLORATIONS.

The collections of the Museum have been very materially increased
during the year through the codperation of various collectors, com-
missioned by the Smithsonian Institution or the Museum, as well as
through the interest and courtesy of friends of the Museum who have
voluntarily offered their services in procuring material for the Museum.
The collections which have resulted from the assistance of these per-
sons are here referred to.

Dr. W. L. Abbott, whose contributions to the Museum have for many
years been so generous and acceptable, has added a very interesting
and valuable collection chiefly from Kashmir and Baltistan, comprising
ethnological objects, birds’ skins, mammal skins and skulls, and inelud-
ing specimens of the Himalayan ibex and Vigne’s sheep.

From the Department of Agriculture, through Prof. C. V. Riley,
entomologist, were received 3,473 specimens, representing 636 species
of insects, collected by Mr. A. Koebele, during his connection with the
Death Valley expedition in March and April of 1889. These specimens
were transferred from the Department of Agriculture to the National
Museum.

The Museum has also been the recipient of land and fresh-water
shells from the same locality, obtained during the same expedition.

Mr. James KH. Benedict, of the National Museum, was engaged in
an exploring trip in the vicinity of Point Lookout for the purpose of
obtaining marine invertebrates for the Museum. He was successful
in his undertaking and added several very interesting specimens to
the collection.

Mr. R. M. Bartleman, of the United States legation, Caracas, Vene-
zuela,expressed his willingness to obtain views for the National Museum,
and he was accordingly furnished with a photographie outfit for that
purpose, An interesting series of photographs, representing native
94 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

scenery and other objects connected with Venezuelan life and the sur-
rounding country, has been received from him.

In the chapter on explorations, contained in the Report of the National
Museum for 1890, mention was made of an exploring expedition which
had been sent into the unexplored lands of Africa by the British South
African Exploring Society. This expedition was joined by Mr. William
Harvey Brown, who was sent out under the auspices of the Smith-
sonian Institution in connection with the Naval Eclipse Expedition,
and who had made during the previous year large and valuable addi-
tions to the collections of the National Musewn. In a letter recently
received from him he states that he has secured for the Museum natural
history specimens, including several head of large game from the Um-
swezi River. These specimens have not yet been received. The only
material received from him during the present year are six birds’ skins,
representing four species from Angola.

Mr. J. H. Camp, Leopoldville, Congo district, Africa, in a letter dated
December 29, 1891, offered to collect natural history specimens for the
National Museum. A collection of African butterflies, photographs
of natives, and botanical specimens has been received from him.

Mr. William Astor Chanler, of New York City, visited the Smithson-
ian Institution in September, 1891, and kindly offered during his pro-
posed travels in Africa to make collections for the Smithsonian Insti-
tution. His offer was gladly accepted, and the result of his exploration
in connection with the Institution will be given in a later report.

The U.S. Fish Commission has transferred several large and inter-
esting collections to the National Museum during the year. Among
them are valuable collections of plants from the Galapagos Islands and
Alaska, collected by the Albatross, under the direction ef Prof. Alex-
ander Agassiz; a collection of birds, rocks, insects, batrachians, birds’
skeletons and nests, also collected by the steamer Albatross; specimens
of crustaceans collected by the Albatross in the North Pacific Ocean,
and birds from the Galapagos Islands obtained by the same steamer,
under the direction of Mr. Charles H. Townsend.

The U. S. Geological Survey, has, through its director, Maj. J. W.
Powell, added largely to the mineral collections of the National Museum,
as well as by the contributions made by individuals connected with the
Survey while engaged in field-work in different parts of the country.

On September 15, 1891, letters of introduction to James P. Turnbull,
United States consular agent, San Luis Potosi; Hon. Thomas Ryan,
Minister to Mexico; Rev. George B. Winton, and Dr. Pagenstecher
were given to Mr. P. L. Jouy, of the National Museum, who visited
Mexico for the purpose of making collections of natural history speci-
mens for the National Museum. The results of his expedition will be
recorded in the next Report.

Dr. Edgar A. Mearns, U. 8. Army, while engaged in his work with
the International Boundary Commission, kindly offered to collect natural

history specimens for the National Musewn. There have already
been received from him several very interesting collections, and a full
report of those not mentioned in the accession list accompanying the
present Report, will be given in the Report for 1895.

» Mr. George P. Merrill, of the National Museun, engaged in an explor-
ing expedition through Arizona and New Mexico, and secured for the
Museum some beautiful specimens of onyx marble and other acceptable
geological material. In Virginia and adjoining States he also obtained
interesting ores and marbles.

Mr. Newhall, of the National Museum, while engaged in field-work
for the Museum, obtained rocks, ores, and conglomerates from Virginia
and New Jersey.

Mr. Charles W. Richmond, Department of Agriculture, in a recent
trip through Guatemala and Nicaragua, by an agreement made with the
National Museum, secured several large collections of natural history
specimens. A detailed report of these collections will be found by ref-
erence to the accession list (Section Vv), and the material received after
the close of the present fiscal year will be recorded in the next Report.

In addition to the collections which have heretofore been received
from Mr. I. C. Russell, of the U. S. Geological Survey, in connection
with his explorations in Alaska, he has generously contributed a num-
ber of ethnological objects, consisting of Eskimo ivory carvings, dishes,
spoons, pipes, daggers, dolls, trinkets, ete., from the Upper Yukon
River.

Dr. Timothy E. Wilcox, U.S. Army, Fort: Huachuea, Ariz., has con-
tinued to transmit specimens for the National Museum from the vicinity
of Fort Huachuca. Some very rare specimens of reptiles have been
received from hiin.

Mr. Thomas Wilson, curator of Prehistoric Anthropology in the
National Museum, was present at the opening of the Hopewell mine in
Chillicothe, Ohio. The objects exhumed consisted of copper spools,
copper pieces, bones, mica cut into stencils, a broken effigy, boat-shaped
objects of stone, beads made of bone, and a large number of pearls
bored or drilled, ete.

Mr. William 8S. Yeates, assistant curator of minerals in the National
Museum, collected specimens in North Carolina, and secured some very
acceptable minerals and Miocene fossils.

REPORTS OF THE CURATORS OF THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM
UPON THE PROGRESS OF THEIR WORK DURING THE
FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1892.

99
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By OTs T. Mason, Curator.

During the fiseal year the entire staff of this department has been
engaged in making preparation for the World’s Columbian Exposition. ©
The subject of ethnology at Chicago having been placed under the
charge of Prof. Putnam, of Cambridge, it was necessary to devise some
scheme by which his operations in the general exhibit should be kept
separate from that of the Smithsonian Institution in the Government
building.

After consideration it was thought best to have the work of the
Bureau of Ethnology (which is under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution) and that of the Department of Ethnology united. For the
double purpose of this cooperation and of avoiding conflict with the gen-
eral exhibit, it was very opportune that the work of Maj. Powell, entitled
Indian Linguistic Families of America North of Mexico, was completed,
so that it could be utilized for our purpose. The result of this investi-
gation is that the tribes of North America have been divided into the
following linguistic families: Algonquian, Athapascan, Attacapan, Beo-
thukan, Caddoan, Chimakuan, Chimarikan, Chimmesyan, Chinookan,
Chitimachan, Chumashan, Coahuiltecan, Copehan, Costanoan, Eski-
mauan, Esselenian, Lroquoian, Kalapooian, Karankawan, Keresan, Kio-
wan, Kitunahan, Koluschan, Kulanapan, Kusan, Lutuamian, Mariposan,
Moquelumnan, Muskhogean, Natchesan, Palaihnihan, Piman, Pujunan,
Quoratean, Salinan, Salishan, Sastean, Shahaptian, Shoshonean,
Siouan, Skittagetan, Takilman, Tanoan, Timuquanan, Tonikan, Ton-
kawan, Uchean, Waiilatpuan, Wakashan, Washoan, Weitspekan,
Wishoskan, Yakonan, Yanan, Yukian, Yuman, Zunian.

Many of these stocks, whatever may have been their previous his-
tory, at present include only a few individuals. Indeed a few of them
have become extinet, and are known only in the literature of the early
explorers and missionaries.

The Chicago Exposition furnishes an excellent opportunity of testing
the questions—how far language codrdinates itself with industries and
activities as a mark of kinship and race, and how far climate and the
resources of the earth control the arts and industries of mankind in the

101
102 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

sphere of language and race. For the purpose of testing these questions
thoroughly, the following stocks have been selected: Algonquian,
Athapascan, Eskimauan, Iroquoian, Kiowan, Koluschan, Muskhogean,
Piman, Shoshonean, Siouan, and Yuman, in order to emphasize ori-
ginal influences as affecting activities regardless of stock.

~ Southeastern Alaska and British Columbia were chosen as one region,
northern Colorado, Oregon, and Washington as another, southern Cal-
ifornia and parts adjacent as a third region, and the Pueblo country as
a fourth.

The Algonquian family formerly inhabited the southern and eastern
drainage of Hudson Bay, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, the Atlantie
slope of the United States as far south as the thirty-fifth parallel, the
regions around lakes Michigan, Huron, and Superior, and almost the
entire drainage of the Ohio River. This would give an excellent op-
portunity of studying the effect of twenty-five degrees of latitude and
every variety of elevation, access to inland and salt waters, abundance
or scarcity of various animal and vegetable productions. The question
then in this case would be to find out how far uniformity of activities
had been secured over this wide and varied area by the possession of
a common language.

The Iroquoian stock occupied the region around lakes Erie and On-
tario, and the upper St. Lawrence River. They were also in possession
of the Susquehanna drainage, the mountainous region of Tennessee,
Kentucky, Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, and Alabama, with two
small grants on the Atlantic coast, one in southern Virginia, the other
in eastern North Carolina.

The territory of the Muskhogean stock was bounded on the west by
the Mississippi River, north by the Tennessee River and Cherokee
Country, south by the Gulf of Mexico, east by the Atlantic Ocean.
This stock was early visited by Spanish, French, and English explorers,
and, on account of the advanced civilization of its tribes, has been
looked upon as furnishing the best explanation of the mode of life among
the Mound Builders.

The Siouan stock may be studied with advantage, on account of its
restriction to the country of the buffalo, extending along the Missis-
sippi (and particularly the Missouri), on the plains of the great West,
reaching as far north as Saskatchewan River and as far south as the
city of Natchez. A narrow strait across the State of Wisconsin, extend-
ing to Lake Michigan, was occupied by this stock, and some of the
tribes are known to have lived in the mountains of Virginia and North
Carolina, above the falls of the rivers running into the Atlantic Ocean.
The Biloxis of Louisiana belong also to this stock.

Perhaps the most interesting of all the stocks, as regards geographic
distribution and the relationship between tribal organization, language,
and activities, is the Athapascan, occupying the drainage of the Yukon
River, in Alaska, and the Mackenzie River, in Canada, and extending
DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY. 103

southward and inland to the upper waters of the Frazer River, in British
Columbia. They touch the waters of the Pacific at Cook’s Inlet, in Alaska,
and on the coast of northern California and southern. Oregon. They
are also spread out over Arizona, New Mexico, and northern Mexico.
The distance between the most northern and most southern members
of this stock is over 40 degrees of latitude.

The Eskimauan stock affords an excellent example of a homogeneous
people, spread out over many thousands of miles in an eastern and west-
ern direction, but always in an arctic or subaretic environment. In
this area, however, there is great variety of materials, so that the
same apparatus appears in one place, made of walrus ivory, in another
of antlers, in another of driftwood, in another of bone. At the lowest
points reached by these people may be found implements fashioned from
the standing trees. Another source of variety in the production of
this stock is the accessibility of the various regions to the whaling indus-
try and other forms of trade. In those places from which the trading
vessel has been excluded, the people are living in unchanged simplicity.
In other parts where the natives have been in close contact with the
whites, as in the Russian domain, the acquisition of better tools has
enabled them to improve remarkably upon their own arts, and this may
fairly raise the question whether in other parts of North America the
arts of the aborigines were not bettered by the coming of the superior
race.

The Kiowan stock, so far as we can gain any knowledge of its
spread historically, was confined to a very narrow area in Wyoming
and Nebraska. The Kiowas are surrounded by Siouan, Shoshonean,
and western Algonquian tribes; furthermore, since their home is on the
plains of the great West, the buffalo country, their arts may be expected
to resemble those of the surrounding peoples.

The Shoshonean stock, joined by Brinton and others with the Piman
stock and the Aztecan, is confined chiefly to the Great Interior Basin,
with outlying tribes in and across the mountain east and west. In one
place, at the Moki villages, we have an example of Shoshoneans living
in pueblos; all of the other tribes are dwellers in tents.

The Pueblo country furnishes an excellent example of the mode
of architecture and life controlled by the region, and dominating
over both language and tribal organization. In the open country
among these Pueblos dwell the Apache and Navajo, of Athapascan
stock, and late intruders from the north. These two peoples of the
same family differ very much in ail the arts of life, because the former,
refusing to receive flocks from the Spaniards, have continued their
course as bloodthirsty savages down to the present moment. On the
other hand, the Navajo, accepting flocks of sheep from the Spanish
explorers, have learned the value of personal and tribal property, and
have changed their mode of life and their industries altogether in ae-
cordance with the new state of affairs,
104 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Around the Gulf of California are the Piman and Yuman stocks,
and these, owing to their homogeneous environment, furnish better
material for the student of comparative ethnology. ;

In exhibiting material from the Pacific slope, owing to the great
variety of stocks crowded in circumscribed areas, the study was made
of special regions offering natural conditions. Between Vancouver
Island aud Mount St. Elias is a vast forest region, the waters abound-
ing in fish. Here are the Koluschan, Chimmessyan, Skittagetan, and
Wakashan stocks, and their homogeneous environment enables the
ethnologist to study the diversities of tribes and stock, so far as they
are expressed in natural things.

The Salishan and Shahaptian stocks together occupy the drainage of
the Lower Frazer and Columbia rivers and could easily be considered
apart. But from the mouth of Columbia River to the Santa Barbara
Islands there is such a confusion of languages that we should hardly
expect to find a new set of activities corresponding to each one of
them.

The effort was made during the year to set up in proper costume
groups of men, women, and children belonging to the largest of these
stocks, engaged in some characteristic operation, so as to give to the
visitors to the exhibition some idea of how the people would look in
their homes. In addition to this, an arrangement was made for a series
ot alcoves, each one devoted to a separate stock. The objects were to be
arranged in these aleoves to show the habitation, industries, and activ-
ities of the tribes belonging to the several stocks. Supplementary to
this, a series of alcoves was devoted to characteristic arts, and in these
the materials, apparatus, and products of each art were arranged upon
an ethnographic basis, enabling the beholder to compare tribe with
tribe upon the basis of a single industry.

Inasmuch as a large amount of American aboriginal handiwork is
made by women, it has been thought advisable to devote one alcove
exclusively to woman’s work. The object of this is especially to show
that the seeds of our modern industrial life were sown by women in
savagery. Whether we regard the exploitation of the earth for min-
erals in the shape of clay for pottery or materials for cooking vessels
and cutlery, the gleaning of the fields and forests for plants to be
worked up into food and textile, or the manipulation of animal sub-
stances of food, shelter, clothing or useful apparatus, the result is the
same. It has been decided to exhibit these results in an alcove espe-
cially set apart for women’s work.

ACCESSIONS.
The following accessions, made during the year, deserve special men-
tion:

As a result of the patent congress, Miss Nellie Long Maynard loaned to the Na-
tional Museum, through Mr. George W. Maynard, the collection of models and fire-
DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY. 105

arms illustrative of the invention of the Maynard rifle. This deposit. in connection
with that of Col. Dodge, secures to the Museum a most creditable series of breech-
loading firearms.

From the Cocopa, Yaki, Yuma, Papago, and other tribes of Sonora, Mexico, and
Lower €alifornia, Mr. Edward Palmer collected for the Museum objects illustrating
the industries of these tribes. The specimens in this collection are of the greatest
value because they were selected in order to illustrate the humble industries of
these tribes.

The Icelandic Natural History Society made a contribution of clothing and honse-
hold utensils from that island.

The musical instruments of the Samoan islands were contributed by Hon. Howard
M. Sewall. :

From Torres Straits Mr. A. C. Haddon sent a collection of eighty-three pieces il-
lustrating the arts and life of the natives of that region. They are especially in-
teresting on account of the contact at this point between the Papuan and Austra-
lians.

Capt. J. O. Spicer, of Groton, Conn., has added one more to the many obligations
under which the Museum has been brought by his generosity in giving specimens of
Eskimo clothing from Hudson Bay.

Hon. Alex. R. Webb, consul to the Phillippine Islands, collected apparatus for
games and gambling.

The collection of 372 pieces of Mr. James Mooney from Kiowa, Cheyenne, and
Arapaho, Comanche, Sioux, and Wichita Indians was made with a view to illustrat-
ing the life of these tribes at the Chicago Exposition. Therefore they are of special
value for ethnographic study.

Capt. John G. Bourke continued to manifest his interest in the Museum and sent
trom Mexico objects of very great value.

Dr. W. J. Hottman, for the Bureau of Ethnology, made a collection among the
Ojibwa and Menomonee Indians.

Mr. R. W. Bartleman, United States legation, Caréeas, Venezuela, has taken a
special interest in the National Museum, and sent valuable material from that coun-
try.

Mr. Emile Granier contributed costumes and industrial implements from the Arap-
ahos and Shoshones.

The Museum was very fortunate to secure from the Royal Zoélogical Museum,
Florence, through Mr. H. H. Gigloli, ethnological specimens from New Guinea,
Andaman Islands, and from several groups in the Molgave and Melanesian area.

Miss Anna Picher, of Pasadena, Cal., contributed specimens of Mexican handiwork.

Dr. Z. T. Danie!, U.S. Army, continued to favor the Museum with specimens from
Dakota.

Mr. 8. G. Worth, U. 8. Fish Commission, contributed apparatus to illustrate the
turpentine industry of North Carolina.

Mr. Fred. A. Ober sent from various islands of the West Indies rude appliances in
vogue among the more ignorant peoples.

Lieut. George Emmons, U. 8. Navy, sent to the Museum a number of bracelets of
great value from Sitka.

Through Hon. Rounseyelle Wildman, United States consul at Singapore, the Mu-
seum received a sinall number of weapons and apparatus for gaming.

Dr. Washington Matthews made a collection of Navajo wools and the material
used in dyeing them.

Dr. W. H. Dall gave to the Museum collections made in India by his father, Rev.
€. H. Dall.

The Museum is greatly indebted to Mr. I. C. Russell for 171 specimens collected
during his exploration of interior Alaska.

Dr. C. E. Woodruff, U. S. Army, contributed 37 photos of Hupa Indians in Cali-
fornia,
106 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

From Mr. H. R. Thornton the Museum secured a complete suit of armor made in
imitation of that of Japan from plate of walrus ivory.

A collection of ethnological objects from the Montagnais Indians of Labrador was
presented by Mr. Henry G. Grant.

Lieut. G. B. Harber, U.S. Navy, presented a costly and beautiful series of fing cloth-
ing from the Yokut of North Siberia. Additional value is given this collection by
the fact that these costumes were worn by Lieut. Harber and members of his party
during the Jeannette relief expedition.

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes presented to the Museum illustrations of Moki dances and
rendered good service in labeling many of the specimens collected already in the
Museum from ancient Tusayan.

Dr. Franz Boas brought from the Chinuk tribes of Washington Territory a small
collection.

From Capt. R. H. Pratt, U.S. Army, the Museum has received a large collection from
various Indian tribes represented by the children at Carlisle school.

From Mr, Charles de Struve the Museum received 39 portraits of the people of
Russia.

Mr. John Murdoch gave a small collection of Eskimo clothing personally made by
him at Point Barrow, Alaska.

The Museum received a great many favors from Mr. Stuart Culin, of Philadelphia,
who has familiarized himself with the games of the Chinese.

Mr. J. H. Turner, of the U.S. Coast Survey, gave the Museum 277 specimens col-
lected on the boundary line between Alaska and Canada.

Dr. R. H. Lamborn, of Philadelphia, has loaned to the Museum a collection of
Galton’s anthropometric apparatus.

Mr. Edward Lovett, of Croydon, England, has continued to enrich the Museum
with specimens from the East.

ROUTINE WORK.

The routine work of the department of ethnology during the fiscal
year was greatly aided by the construction of a large cabinet for the
study series of objects and the setting apart of a special room for
specimens too large for the ordinary cabinet. Owing to the lack of
space it will be impossible in the future to increase the number of ob-
jects on exhibition at any one time. To meet the difficulty, and also to
prepare for any additional space which may be granted in the future to
this department, the curator has continued to mount and label new
specimens in standard unit boxes. The boxes compare in size to the
standard Museum drawers, viz: 30 inches in length by 24 inches in
width, and of any depth to suit specimens from 2 to 12 inches. When
once the specimens are mounted andlabeled and sealed up in these ex-
hibition boxes, these may be filed away on shelves or racks like books
in a library.

The curator has had a large number of drawings made and has pre-
pared the library material for a monograph on the arts of war among
the North American aborigines. Mr. Walter Hough has bestowed a
great deal of care on the preparation of a catalogue of the Korean col-
lection,* which has been brought together through the codperation of

*See Report of U.S. National Museum, 1891, pp. 429-488.
DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY. 107

Dr. Allen, Ensign Bernadou, U. S. N., Mr. P. L. Jouy, and others in-
terested in the work of the National Museum.

In conclusion the curator most earnestly hopes that in future more
ample accommodations may be furnished for the exhibition of the
ethnological collections. The object of all such exhibits should be the
education of the people in the history of culture, but a comprehensive
and correct idea of human progress can be given only where there is
sufficient room to tell the whole story without crowding.

The first catalogue entry in July, 1891, was 152651, and the last
entry in June, 1892, was 153894, giving a total of 1,243 entries.

The number of specimens received during the year is 2,241.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF AMERICAN ABORIGINAL POTTERY
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By WiLitiAM H. Houtmus, Honorary Curator.

The operations in this department have been chiefly confined to the
instalment of a large number of collections, none of which are of espe-
cial importance. These collections consisted for the most part of frag-
mentary wares collected for the Bureau of Ethnology by the curator
and his assistants in the tide-water districts of Maryland and Virginia,
and in the Gila valley, Arizona.

During the year the curator completed an elaborate paper upon the
pottery of the mound-builders, to be published by the Bureau of Eth-
nology. Two papers upon aboriginal decorative art, derived from
ceramic sources, were published in the “ American Anthropologist,”
one in the January and the other in the April number.

The last catalogue number for June, 1891, is 136183; and for June,
1892, 155306.

Donations of earthenware were made by the following persons: Mr.
Samuel A. L. Queredo presented fragments of painted pottery from the
Argentine Republic, South America. Mr. W. Hallet Phillips trans-
mitted fragments of vases from Ossabaw Island, Georgia. Mr. William
Harden contributed a large earthen vessel from Ossabaw_ Island,
Georgia. Prof. G. K. Gilbert, of the U.S. Geological Survey, presented
fragments of ancient pueblo ware from Arizona. Mr. Henry Adams
sent fragments of pottery from St. Helena Island, Georgia. Capt. John
G. Bourke, U.S. Army, transmitted earthen vessels from Guadalajara,
Mexico. Mr. Arthur H. Weston gave fragments of pottery from Florida.
Thomas Dowling, jr., contributed fragments of pottery from Montgom-
ery County, Md. From Mr. EK. 8. Golson were received fragments of
pottery from Saginaw River, Michigan.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES
IN THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892,

3y CYRUS ADLER, Assistant Curator,

In the absence in Europe of Prof. Paul Haupt, honorary curator of
the section, I beg to subinit the following report for the past year:

The scope of an oriental department fully organized may be seen
from the division into sections which was adopted by a committee of
the American Oriental Society, organized for the purpose of drawing
up a programme to be submitted in the event of the assembling of an
International Congress of Orientalists in America. The sections were
as follows:

I. Aryan section. II. Semitic section (Hebrew, Arabic, Syriac,
ete.). ILI. Cuneiform section, including all languages using cuneiform
characters. IV. Egyptian section, comprising the other African lan-
guages with the exception of Ethiopic and Arabic. V. Section of the
extreme Orient (China and Japan) and of Central Asia.

The Section of Oriental Antiquities, in view of the limitations upon
its scope and resources, is practically devoted to Biblical archeology,
to the archeology, history, languages, arts, and religions of the peo-
ples of western Asia and Egypt. Material is chosen which especially
illustrates Biblical history, and labels are prepared from this point of
view. |

The fact must be emphasized that before the organization of this sec-
tion was contemplated, much of the material which would find place in
a department of oriental antiquities had been collected for the Museum
and installed in other departments, where it still remains.

In the report for 1889 the hope was expressed that from the policy
inaugurated by the Museum of preparing copies of Assyro-Babylonian
objects for a study collection, there would grow a catalogue of all the
Assyro-Babylonian objects in this country. This plan, it is expected,
may shortly be realized. At the meeting of the American Oriental

11h
112 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

Society held in Washington in April, 1892, the following resolution was
adopted :

In view of the introduction into this country of numerous collections of oriental
antiquities, especially from Egypt, Assyria, and Babylonia,

Resolved I, That the Oriental Society recommends that records be obtained of such
objects, in both public and private collections ;

Resolved IT. That a committee of three be appointed by the president to aid in
securing such material.

The assistant curator was appointed a member of this committee.

The American Oriental Society held its annual meeting in the chapel
of the Smithsonian Institution, April 21-25. A portion of the Hodg-
son collection of oriental MSS., and of photographs of Assyrian ob-
jects and of paper impressions of Kgyptian sculpture, was tempo-
rarily placed on exhibition in the chapel during the meeting.

Mr. Frederick Stearns has offered to place his collection of Babylo-
nian cylinders and other oriental objects of glyptic art at the disposal
of the Museum for copy.

The honorary curator, Prof. Paul Haupt, left for Kurope in the month
of May. He will attend the Ninth International Congress of Oriental-
ists at London as the delegate of the Smithsonian Institution.

The assistant curator returned from his absence in the Orient in the
interest of the World’s Columbian Exposition in the month of January,
and resumed his connection with the Museum on March 1. Much of
his time has been given to the formation of a collection of religious cer-
emonials for the exhibit of the National Museum at the Columbian
Exposition.

Two very carefully made and well-preserved paper molds of a piece
of sculpture and a cuneiform inscription from Persepolis have been
received, through the Department of State, from the Honorable Truxton
Beale, United States minister at Teheran. Casts have been made from
these molds and their contents will be described in a special paper.

Mr. Beale had secured permission from the Persian Government to
remove some objects from Persepolis. On arriving at the spot he con-
cluded that nothing characteristic could be removed without grossly
disfiguring the ruins. He found also that Mr. Herbert Weld Blun-
dell had already commenced to make copies for the British Museum,
but was quite willing that the National Museum should coéperate in
the work. These two moldings, the first made, were presented by
Mr. Blundell to Mr. Beale. It appears that the mold of the cuneiform
inscription is the first ever taken from Persepolis. It is to be hoped
that means will be found to prosecute this important archeological
undertaking.

The Museum has received on deposit from the Telfair Academy of
Arts and Sciences, of Savannah, Ga., a portion of the collection of
oriental books and manuscripts of the late William B. Hodgson. Mr.
Carl L, Brandt, director of the Telfair Academy, is entitled to hearty
SECTION OF ORIENTAL ANTIQUITIES. 1t3

recognition for his assistance in securing the deposit of this interest.
ing collection.

The crowded state of the Museum has rendered it impossible to place
any more objects in the exhibition series,

Two papers, relating to the Hodgson collection, were read by Dr.
Adler before the American Oriental Society at the meeting held in
Washington: ‘“ Notes on William B. Hodgson” and ‘ Christopher
Columbus in oriental literature with special reference to a Turkish
MS.”

The catalogue of the section is kept by the department of ethnology.

REPORT ON THE HISTORICAL COLLECTIONS
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

A. Howarp CLark, Curator.

The curator of historical collections, being also editor of the Pro-
ceedings and Bulletin, and in charge of the printing of iabels and
blanks for all departments of the Museum, has been unable to give as
much attention as desired to the general work on the very valuable
collection of objects classified as ‘ historical relics,” and which are of
very great interest to the numerous visitors to the National Museum.

An effort has been made to place on exhibition relics or memorials
that may teach biography or American history in an intelligent man-
ner, rather than to exhibit objects that are simply “curios,” bearing 10
special relation to eminent men or important events.

Being without the aid of an experienced assistant, the curator is
unable to report much technical work accomplished in the study and
arrangement of the hundreds of medals and coins that have accumu-
lated. In fact, the incomplete condition of several classes of objects on
exhibition, as regards proper labeling and installation, has necessitated
the temporary withdrawal of some of the most interesting collections.

For exhibition at the Columbian Historical Exposition at Madrid in
the summer and fall of 1892, the curator brought together quite a full
series of American colonial coins; medals illustrating the colonial
period, the Revolutionary War, and medals commemorative of political *
and civic events, besides a large series of paper money, extending from
the early days of the American colonies down to the present national
currency; also postage stamps of each issue since 1847, when they
were introduced in this country; maps of early explorers, engravings
of important national events, ete.

The character of the historical colleetions in the National Museum
was outlined in the curator’s report for the last fiscal year, and an effort
has been made to carry out the plan therein set forth. Some valuable
additions have been made to the collections. The number of accessions
has been thirty-three, aggregating several hundreds of individual

115

116 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM 1892,

objects. Among the important accessions were the cabinet of ancient
and modern gold, silver, and copper coins, antique seals, ete., bequeathed
by Gen. Meigs; the Cox memorial vase from Mrs. 8. 8. Cox; the Sevres
vase presented to Prof. Hilgard, some autograph papers by President
Adams and William Henry Harrison, the original roll and muster of
Gen. Washington’s body-guard in 1782, a dish and ewer of precious
metals presented to Admiral Jouett, and a complete collection of photo-
graphic and engraved portraits and autograph letters of members of
the National Academy of Sciences.

The curator has been called upon to examine and report on ten col-
lections of coins, medals, and historic objects, which have been returned
to the owners.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF GRAPHIC ARTS
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By 8. R. KOEHLER, Curator.

Repeating the words of my report for last year, it may be said that
the work done in the section of graphic arts during the fiscal year just
ended, does not show perceptibly in the appearance of the collections
exhibited. The aim has again been to make the several divisions more
complete by filling gaps here and there, and these additions are, as a
matter of course, lost in the mass to the general observer. From the
following details it will appear that the endeavor to complete the illus-
tration of the modern photo-mechanical processes has been continued,
while at.the same time due attention has been given to the other
departments, so far as the means at command would allow. :

The most important additions of the year are the illustrations of the
half-tone relief screen process and of a variety of the photo-aquatint
intaglio process (Photogravure Gilbo), prepared for the Museum at
reduced prices by Mr. M. Wolfe, of Dayton, Ohio, and Messrs. A. W.
Elson & Co., of Boston, Mass., respectively. Some interesting speci-
mens, illustrating the advances made in chromocollographic process ©
work, have been given by Mr. KE. Bierstadt, of New York, and the J. B.
Lippincott Company, of Philadelphia. The collection of materials
used in the photo-mechanical processes has been increased by gifts
from Messrs, Jas. P. Smith & Co., of New York, and by purchase. A
beginning towards the illustration of the application of chromolitho-
graphy and of wood-cutting to the production of posters—a kind of
work which has reached a high order of merit in the United States—
has been made by the gift of a few specimens by the A. S. Seer Theat-
rical Printing Company, of New York; the Courier Lithographing
Sompany, of Buffalo, N. Y., and Messrs. W. J. Morgan & Co., of Cleve-
land, Ohio, and by the purchase of some of the tools used. The fol-
lowing additions to the illustrations of the history of the reproductive
arts have been made by purchase: Head of Christ, P. 192, woodcut
after Diirer; Portrait of Otto Heinrich von Schwarzenberg, woodeut,
dated 1607, by Chr. van Sichem, after Goltzius; Christ before Annas, B
12, engraving on copper by Israel van Meckenem; Portrait of Philip
II, engraving on copper, dated 1586, by Hieronymus Wierix; Portrait

121
122 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

of Jan Lutma, the younger, by himself, dated 1681, executed on copper
with punches (opus mallet), the first specimen of this kind of work ac-
quired by the Museum, and a fine proof of J. G. Miller’s portrait of
Anton Graff, after Graff, engraved on copper.

The specimens received during the year have mostly been placed on
exhibition. To accomplish this, part of the division of photo-mechani-
cal process work had to be rearranged, and a number of table-cases
had to be placed in the aleoves. These cases interfere somewhat with
the appearance of, and the freedom of movement in, the alcoves, but they
are excellently well adapted for the display of technical specimens, and
it is to be hoped, therefore, that more of them will be provided as the
collections grow and are rearranged. Considerable progress has been
made in the labeling, by the substitution of written for printed labels.
It has been possible in this way to label nearly all the specimens on the
eastern, and a considerable number of those on the western side of the
hall of Graphic Arts. It is now proposed to complete the labeling in
this manner, leaving the collections for the present in essentially their
actual condition, with the exception of such additions as it may be pos-
sible to make meanwhile. The next step will be the systematic cata-
loguing of all the material on hand, and the endeavor to procure such
additional specimens as are needed to complete the various series.
This done, the whole collection can be rearranged according to the
catalogue, and a manual of it can be prepared for the use of students.
The exhibition of The Reproductive Arts, arranged by me at the Mu-
seum of Fine Arts, Boston, at the beginning of this year (1892), and
the catalogue prepared for the same exhibition, were preliminary stud-
ies on the basis of which the more extensive scheme planned for the
U.S. National Museum is to be carried out.

No further progress has been made in the arrangement of the collee-
tion of patents.

The last number entered on the catalogue of the section of Graphic
Arts for the year ending June 30, 1891, having been 4797, and the cor-
responding number for the year now under consideration being 4976,
it follows that the number of entries during the year has been 179. As -
some few of these entries represent more than one specimen, the num-
ber of accessions may be given in round numbers at about 200. Of
these specimens 42 were purchased. <A list of the donors is included
in Section v of the report. No statistics can be given, for the present,
of the reserve and duplicate series.

IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892,

By Dr. B. E. FERNOW, Honorary Curator.

The forestry collections have remained without many additions, owing
to the fact that lack of space limits their exhibition, and the bulkiness
of the material makes it undesirable to add to them in the storage-
rooms.

Since the Museum does not, like the Kew Gardens, command any
grounds of its own for the exhibition of living specimens, and the city
parks of Washington afford ample opportunity to serve as an arboretum,
the curator ot forestry collections has prepared during the year a full
list, with notes, of all the tree species found in these parks, and plotted
the same so that they may be readily found. This compilation, car-
ried on at the expense of the Museum, will be ready for publication next
year.

REPORT ON THE SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By J. ELFRETH WATKINS, Curator,

During the fiscal year ending June 30, 1892, the time of the curator
was largely taken up by assignment to other duties; hence little atten-
tion could be devoted to the section.

Unfortunately for the student of the history of the American steam-
boat and railway, little thought was given in the early days to the
preservation of objects which would now be considered invaluable
relics of the early stages of the development of these appliances of
transportation upon water and land.

So far as is known, the important relics now in existence, with very
few exceptions, have been deposited in the U. 8. National Museum
through the cooperation of the officials of railway and steamboat com-
panies. The future additions to the transportation collection must,
therefore, necessarily consist of models and drawings of historic objects.
Since the appropriations by Congress did not permit of their construe-
tion or purchase, extension of the collection during the year has been
made by the acquisition of such objects relating to the development of
the mechanic arts as illustrate the evolution of the epoch-making inven-
tiorts.

During the year the curator took part in the meetings* of the Ameri-
can Association for the Advancement of Science, at Washington; the
convention of the Old-Time Telegraphers’ Association, at Washington,
and the ceremonies at the completion of the monument erected by the
Pennsylvania Railroad Company at Bordentown, N. J.

The erection of this monument (Plate 1) by the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company, to mark the first piece of iron railway track laid between
New York and Philadelphia in 1831, attracted the attention of officials
and employés of the railway companies throughout this country, and
the general public as well, and a description thereof found place in the
principal railroad journals of Europe and America. <A description of

the monument from the memorial volume issued at the time is given
below: ;

The railroad monument at Bordentown, erected by the Pennsylvania Railroad
Company, was completed in 1891. It is composed of a cube of Baltimore granite, 5
feet square and 7 feet high, supported upon an octagonal foundation composed of the
stone blocks upon which the iron rails were originally laid in the tracks of the Cam-
den and Amboy Railroad. Around this cube is a circle composed of two of the
original rails with which the road was first laid. These rails are supported by stone
blocks according to the original practice, the spikes and joint fixtures also being
from the original tracks. This type of rails, which is now known throughout the
world as the ‘‘ American rail,” was designed by Robert L. Stevens in 1831. Sunk in
the south side of the granite block is a bronze tablet, which contains a representa-
tion (carefully drawn to seale), in relief, of the locomotive ‘‘ John Bull,” with
tender improvised from a freight truck, with tank consisting of a whisky hogshead,
and the two passenger cars that first did service in the State of New Jersey in 1831.

The tablet (Plate1r) contains the following inscription in raised letters:

“FIRST MOVEMENT BY STEAM ON A RAILROAD IN THE STATE OF NEW
JERSEY, NOVEMBER 12, 1831, BY THE ORIGINAL LOCOMOTIVE ‘JOHN
BULL,’ NOW DEPOSITED IN THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM
AT WASHINGTON. THE FIRST PIECE OF RAILROAD TRACK IN NEW JER-
SEY WAS LAID BY THE CAMDEN AND AMBOY RAILROAD COMPANY BE-
TWEEN THIS POINT AND THE STONE, THIRTY-FIVE HUNDRED FEET EAST-
WARD, IN 1831.”

Upon the east side of the block, cut into the granite are the words:
‘“CAMDEN AND AMBOY RAILROAD, 1831,”
and on the reverse side is inseribed:
“ERECTED BY THE PENNSYLVANIA RAILROAD COMPANY, 1891.”

The programme of the exercises at the celebration of the sixtieth
anniversary of the first movement by steam in the State of New Jersey,
which was held at Bordentown, November 12, 1891, was as follows:

The Pennsylvania Railroad Company has since published the
addresses delivered at the celebration in a memorial volume, hand-
somely illustrated.

Interest in the department of transportation at the World’s Colum-
bian Exposition has led to frequent examinations of the collection dur-
ing the year, the objects both in the exhibition and study series being
studied by officials of the Exposition and of several railroad compa-
nies who propose to take part therein. The chief of the department
of transportation-exhibits of the Columbian Exposition spent several

days in the Museum, in August, 1891, where he studied the collections
and had access to a provisional outline of a proposed exhibit, which
had been prepared by the curator at the request of the assistant see-
retary of the Smithsonian Institution, to be used if it were decided that
the section of transportation and enginecring should be represented in
the Governnent exhibit at Chicago.

With the return of this scheme of classification the following corm-
munication was received:

OFFICE OF THE DIRECTOR-GENERAL,
WoORLD’s COLUMBIAN EXPOSITION,
Chicago, Ilt., U. S. 4., August 27, 1897.

DEAR Sir: I return herewith a scheme of a transportation exhibit, which you
kindly loaned to me, and which promises to be of much value. Iam greatly obliged
to you for the favor, as also for the other literature which you kindly gave me.  I6
will save a great deal of research which would otherwise have been necessary.

Yours truly,
WILLARD A. SMITH.

Prof. J. E. WATKINS,

National Museum, Washington, D.C.

Access to the study and exhibition series in the section was also
given to Maj. J.G. Pangborn, special agent in charge of the Baltimore
and Ohio Railroad Company’s historical exhibit at the World’s Colum-
bian Exposition. Numerous photographs of models and drawings in
the collection were made by Maj. Pangborn’s representative for this
exhibit, which promises to be more elaborate than ever before made at
an exposition by a railroad company.

At the request of the chief clerk of the Post-Office Department a
number of models and drawings in the collection were photographed to
form the basis of illustrations for a publication which is designed to
show the growth of the United States Post-Office Department.

Among the important accessions during the year are the following:

Electrical locomotive, which made the most rapid recorded speed (115 to 120 miles
per hour) on land, by generated power, at Lanrel, Md., in the year 1889. Publicly
reported by O. T. Crosby in his paper entitled High Speed Electrical Works, and
by J. Dashiell, jr., in the Electrical Railway as Applied to Steam Roads. Both papers
are to be found in the proceedings of the American Association of Mechanical Engi-
neers.

The following letter accompanied this most interesting piece of machin-
ery:

New York, June 13, 1890.

My Drar Sir: According to your request I make the following statement: My
electric motor was originated and designed by me for rapid speed. I had in view
the enlargement of the same to supplant the steam engine on standard railroads for
long-distance service.

It was the first electric motor which was successfully run with the armatures
wound directly around the axles, thereby doing away with all wearing parts except
the journals, and admitting of any speed desirable.

H, Mis, 114, pt. 2 9

130 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

My motor was run near Lanrel, Md., on a circular track, 2 miles in cireumference,
constructed especially for making these experiments, which extended over a period
of nearly two years, during which time speeds were made from 100 to 120 miles per
hour. Twenty miles per hour was the fastest speed made by any other electrical
motor until mine had made 100 miles per hour,

Yours very truly,
Davip G. WEEMS.
Prof. J. E. WATKINS,
Washington, D.C,

The following certificate is attached to the locomotive:

On December 3, 1889, I witnessed Mr. Weems’ electric motor make a speed of from
115 to 120 miles per hour. I was employed by Mr. Weems as mechanical engineer
for about two years. and assisted in a number of test trials of speed made with the
motor, and also assisted at the time the above fast rate speed of 115 to 120 miles was
made.

B. J. DASHIELL, JR.

The collection has been greatly enriched by the addition of the series
of models, tem-plates, and drawings of the various sections of rails, which
were considered by ‘the committee on form, weight, manufacture, and
life of rails,” appointed by the American Society of Civil Engineers in
1873, and whose deliberations have had an important bearing upon the
American rail standards for the last twenty years. This series, which
is a most valuable one, was presented by Mr. Octave Chanute, past
president, American Society of Civil Engineers, who was an active
member of the committee during all its deliberations.

A series of models of steel railroad cross-ties used in Europe was
deposited by Dr. B. E. Fernow, of the Division of Forestry in the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, who, in his official capacity, is taking an active
interest in the introduction of metallic ties upon American railroads,
in order that the present demands shall not continue to be made upon
the forests of this country to supply the wants of railroad builders.

Mr. 8S. L. Roberts, of the Amboy Division of the Pennsylvania Rail-
road, has added to the collection previously deposited by him, a num-
ber of objects illustrating the development of the rail splice. These
objects were mainly collected from the old Camden and Amboy Rail-
road.

The value of the collection of telegraphic apparatus has been greatly
enhanced through the enthusiastic cobperation of Mr. George C. May-
nard, of Washington, secretary of the American Association of Invent-
ors and Manufacturers. .

During the annual convention of the Old Time Telegraphers’ Associ-
ation their loan collection of telegraph apparatus was, at his sugges-
tion, placed on exhibition in the section, and attracted much attention.

Among the important objects since deposited are to be found the
cross-arm and insulator laid on the line from Washington to Baltimore
in 1841; a register and relay used in the first office opened in Indiana
in 1848; twisted telegraph wire used in 1864; various forms of earthen-
ware and glass insulators, and a pair of English dial telegraph instru-
ments.
SECTION OF TRANSPORTATION AND ENGINEERING. jSyk

The collection showing the development of the typewriting machine
has received several valuable additions, among them the typewriter in-
vented by John Pratt in 1864, which was obtained through his kindly
assistance.

Messrs. Wyckoff, Seamans & Benedict have added a Danish writing-
ball and other old forms of typewriters to their collection, among them
a model of the Sholes & Glidden typewriter invented in 1867, together
with the original of one of the first machines made from this model.

The curator has received communications from the Caligraph Coim-
pany and Mr. W. H. Travis, of Philadelphia, both of whom promise
valuable additions to this collection.

The Singer Manufacturing Company has increased the collection of
sewing machines referred to in the last report.

The application of Jesse Ramsden for a patent for an equatorial
instrument, written and signed by himself, has been presented to the
Museum by Mr. Park Benjamin and placed in the case with the origi-
nal dividing engine, deposited a few years since by Dr. Morton, presi-
dent of Stevens Institute.

Among the relies, attention may be called to the plaster model from
which the bronze tablet for the monument erected at Bordentown by
the Pennsylvania Railroad Company was cast. This model was re-
ceived through Mr. J. T. Richards.

A sedan chair, decorated with gold and handsomely upholstered,
which was owned and used by the royal family of France during the
reign of Louis XIV, has been deposited in the collection by Miss Kathe-
rine Parsons, of Washington.

The recent increase of popular interest in matters relating to the his-
tory of transportation is most remarkable, while the recognition of the
importance of illustrating this phase of human effort by the managers
of American expositions is none the less gratifying.

At the Centennial Exposition of 1876 a single old steam locomotive
and ear were exhibited, together with a few implements of transporta-
tion, shown in the ethnological collection. At New Orleans, ten years
later, a single railway exhibited a series of models of ancient locomo-
tives and cars. At Cincinnati, in 1888, the first synoptical exhibit
showing the development of the art of transportation was made by the
U.S. National Museum in the Government building, where a very lim-
ited space could be devoted to the subject.

At the World’s Columbian Exposition, four years later, a handsome
exhibition building containing 250,000 square feet of floor space has
been erected, which, together with the annex, occupies an area of over
17 acres.

It is indeed a matter of the greatest satisfaction to know that the
importance of that place in history which is occupied by the record of
the development of the methods of intercommunication through which
132 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

our national growth has been so greatly accelerated during the century,
is thus to receive due recognition.

The extent of the collection of transportation exhibits, together with
the publications in relation thereto, can not fail to make a permanent
and world-wide impression, both upon the visitors who see, and those
absent who read of their maguitude.

Thus will the future generations be made to understand the influ-
ence Which the world’s great systems of transportation have had upon
the progress of civilization during the four centuries since Columbus
sailed away from Palos in a caravel,

IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By WiLiiaAM 8. Dixon, U.S. Navy, Honorary Curator.

During the year ending June 30, 1892, the labeling of specimens and
illustrations of plants, ete., in the exhibit was completed. Several
specimens that had deteriorated were replaced by good examples.
Kifforts were made to identiiy some of the vegetable specimens presented
to the Museum. Their accompanying history being meager, and essen-
tial characteristics absent, a satisfactory recognition was impossible.

The accessions during the year number 55, and were received princi-
pally from the Royal Kew Gardens, England. Several specimens were
received from W. H. Schieffelin & Co., in response to special request.
The arrangement of this section is, essentially, as left by Dr. Flint, the
first curator of this collection.

GENERAL REVIEW OF THE YEAR’S WORK.

The general character of the work of the past year is not greatly dif-
ferent from that of other years. There is the same reception of speci-
mens, their classification, entering, numbering, and cataloguing; they
then have to be marked and put in the display cases assigned to the
State to which they belong, or if not classified geographically, among
other specimens of the same kind.

The curator was engaged during the first part of the fiscal year upon
the preparation of a work which he considered was needed in the United
States—a gathering or collection of the evidences of high antiquity of
man in America, Later on, he took up a particular chapter of that
work, to wit, that on arrow- and spear-heads or knives. Before the lat-
ter was entirely completed, he was called upon to prepare an exhibit
for the Exposicion Historico-Americano, held at Madrid,* Spain, in
celebration of the fourth centenary of the discovery of America by
Christopher Columbus.

It was believed that the display made for Madrid could be utilized
for the Chicago Exposition, and the work thus done in the current year
would serve equally well for the display to be made in the subsequent
year, but that hope has not been realized.

The number of specimens received during the past year is about equal
to the average of former years, amounting to nearly ten thousand speci-
mens.

IMPORTANT ACCESSIONS RECEIVED DURING THE YEAR.

From Dr. Edward Palmer: A collection of objects from an ancient
Indian village site 34 miles NW. by N. from Manzanillo, Mexico. A large
obsidian implement, 3 polished hatchets, a hammer stone, a rubbing

Was to open in that city on the 13th of September, though it did not actually do so
until the 30th of October. It closed on the Ist of February, and the display has not
returned at the time of writing this report, although Mr. Wilson did not remain dur-
ing the entire period of the exposition.

stone, fragment of a metate, > clay-vessels, 90 fragments of pottery,
22 small grotesque clay figures (human form), 15 ornamental clay beads,
5 obsidian flakes, a shell ornament, an animal tooth, a fragment of
human jaw with teeth (child), a stone ax, and a quantity of broken
pottery (not counted); one hundred and forty-nine specimens. From
Mr. Palmer’s notes concerning this collection the following extracts are
taken: “In a secluded cove of the harbor of Manzanillo is an embank-
ment several feet above high tide, upon which is a thicket of bushes and
trees. Removing these and by digging, remains of an Indian village
site containing stone implements, pottery, etc., are discovered. Much
excavating has been done, and some of the embankment from time to -
time has crumbled down, tending to still more break the pottery. It
would seem that at the time of its abandonment (probably during the
Spanish conquest) much of the material was broken and destroyed, as
none of the stone mortars and metates are complete.” With this acces-
sion were also received 46 fragments of clay figures (mostly human
form), from ancient house sites near the village of Almeria, State of
Colima, Mexico, 30 miles east of Manzanillo. Mr. Palmer says: ‘+A
railroad cut revealed the house sites. The surface in places shows
rocks of different forms and sizes placed in rude cireles. The Indians
who once lived here were removed by force, and that would account
for the fragmentary condition of most of the objects found.”

In addition to the above-mentioned objects was sent a human skele-
ton* with painted bones, from a cave on the island of Espiritu Santo,
near the harbor of La Paz, Lower California.

From the Royal Zodlogical Museum, Florence, Italy, through Prof.
Henry H. Giglioli: Twenty-five worked flint flakes, a terra-cotta ball,
a terra-cotta fusaiole of unusual shape, 2 earthenware vases, a boar’s
tusk, and a point of roebuck’s horn, from the cave of Lazzaro, Rosilini,
near Modica, Sicily (see Bull. Paletnologia Ital. vu, 1892); bone
breccia with worked flints imbedded, from cavern of Les Eyzies, Dor-
dogne, France, Lartet & Christy; 6 fragments of subfossil bones and
2 teeth of equus and 10 worked flint knives and scrapers from a
cave on the island of Levanzo (Egades), W. Sicily—discovered by
Prof. H. H. Giglioli, August 29, 1890; 7 flint knives and scrapers
and two arrowheads, from Sartiano, Siena, Italy; 2 flint knives, a
scraper, and 13 arrowheads, collected in the vicinity of Florence,
Italy; portion of a flint borer, found at the Therm of Caracalla,
tome, Italy; 3 casts in wax of beautiful flint implements (knife, ar-
rowhead, and a dagger, or spearhead), from an Etruscan tomb at Sa-
turnia, Tuscan Maremina.+ The originals are in the Museum of Anthro-
~*'The skeleton was presented to me [Mr. Palmer] by Gaston Vevis, esq., of La Paz.
Nothing was reported to have been found with the bones. (Ace. 24600.)

iThe question ‘* Whence came the Etruseans” is probably the foundation of the

oldest dispute or discussion known to history. It beganin the fifth century B.C., be-
tween Herodotus and Dionysius of Halicarnassus, and continued until the nineteenth

Italy; a stone fusaiole found near Arezzo, Tuscany; blade of a bronze
dagger, found near Cortona, Tuscany (rare); 2 primitive bronze fig-
ures (human), votive or sacred, from an Etruscan tomb near Chiusi,
Italy (rare); 2 bronze man heads, spikes, from Etruscan necro-
polis, near Chiusi (rare); a Roman sling-stone in lead, with inserip-
tion, found near Ascoli-Piceno, Italy (rare); an Etruscan sling-stone
in lead, with inscription, found near Cortona, Italy (rare) (this speci-
men is Similar in shape to the sling-stones of steatite used by the natives
of New Caledonia); a small silver fibula, Greco-Italic, from an ancient
tomb near Japua, southern Italy; plaster cast of a small stone chisel
from the Santa Cruz district, Jamaica, West Indies (the original is in
the archeological museum, at Cambridge, England); a worked flint
knife or scraper from the Babel-Maluk Valley, near Thebes, Egypt, and
5 flint flakes found with many similar ones near Baalbec, Syria; col-
lected by Dr. Verio in 1890; 5 fragments of rudely ornamented pot-
tery, 3 shells, 26 bones of a pig (Sus andamanensis), and 2 bones of a
fish from a Kitchen-midden, near Port Blair, Andaman Isiands, Bay
of Bengal (relics of the aborigines), collected by EK. H. Man, esq.;
7 fragments of coarse pottery from a mound on the Manatee River,
British Honduras, collected by J. Ballamy in 1890; 6 rude figures in
coarse terra cotta, excavated from ancient tombs on the bank of the
Rio Tajajos, Province of Para, Brazil; the figures represent an owl, a
tortoise, a sitting human figure, the legs of a bird, a human head, and
a cone-shaped object, collected by A. M. d’Almeida Leal in 1889. -En-
tire number of objects received, 146. (Acc. 24918.)

From the National Museum of Anthropology and Ethnology, Florence,
Italy, through Dr. Paolo Mantegazza, curator: A collection of archieologi-
cal specimens from Italy; a fragment of worked wood and a plaster cast
representing a somewhat similar piece, from the lacustrine habitation
at Mecurago, Province of Novara (bronze age): model in plaster of a
perforated stone disk, and a fragment of pottery from lacustrine habi-
tation at Isolino, Lake Varese; fragment of pottery (brilé), Terramare
de Noceto, Parma; tragment of pottery from the cave of Bergegei
(Savona); terra-cotta spindle whorl /usaiole from Mount Calamita, island
of Elbe; two polished hatchets from Casentino, and one from Mount
Cuccoli, Tuscany; polished stone hatchet (diorite) from the Province of

eentury. The discovery in this country of, prehistoric man with his ages of stone
and bronze has settled the question that the Etruscan country was occupied long
prior to the Etruscan civilization, and, there being nothing to the contrary, we may
suppose that the former occupants were the ancestors of the Etruscans. Some of
the monuments at Saturnia were dolmens and have been recognized as belonging to
the prehistoric ages of stone or bronze. It may, therefore, be doubted whether the
“)eautiful flint implements” mentioned really came from an ‘‘ Etruscan tomb”
at Saturnia. As they are similar in every particular to prehistoric flint implements,
it has been contended that they belonged to the ages of stone or bronze, and were
earlier than Etruscan.—Curator.

the valley of the Vibrata, Abruzzi (collection of Dr. Concerio Rosa); 2
flint flakes or knives from the valley of the Vibrata and 1 from the
Ambra; a bronze hatchet from Maremma, Tuscany.

The following objects (11 in number) are from different localities
on the island of Elbe, collected by Dr. Raffaello Foresti: Two flint

From the same source were also received 38 modern oak disks
from interior Italy, turned in a lathe and decorated with concentric
rings. The sizes of these disks are respectively 63 by 2, 43 by 14, 34
by 12 inches. The North American idians had a game called Chung-
kee, played with disks of stone by rolling them on the ground or court.
These wooden disks are used in Italy to play the similar modern game of
Ruzzole (called Ruzzoletta when played by children with the. small
disks). Itis sometimes played by peasants, when they use disks of
cheese in the form common to the country, betting one cheese against
the other, the winner taking both. It is then called ‘+ Giuocco del For-
mageio,” or play of the cheese. It is played by two persons, but may
be by four, arranged in opposing sides. The game is played similar to
quoits, except that the disks are rolled on the ground instead of being
pitched through the air. Goals or marks are established, and the player,
standing alternately at one, rolls toward the other, the disks nearest
the mark being the winners. This game is of great antiquity, and is
believed to be a survival of the classic game represented by the antique
statue of Discobolus. (Ace. 24919.)

from a gravel pit near New Carlisle, of bone perforators and chisels,
pieces of worked bone, animal teeth, broken flint spear heads and frag-
ments of ahuman skull. (Ace. 25633.) From letters received with the
specimens, the following extract is taken:

“The ridge in which the pit was dug is of a glacial formation, having a southeastern
anil northwestern direction. The gravel is in layers and reaches to the surface. On
the top of the ridge the gravel has been removed, making a boat-shaped hole, length
about 15 feet, width in center 6 feet, depth in center 4 feet. In this cavity, which
was filled with red clay mixed with gravel, the specimens were found.

Nos. 1 and 2 (fragments of a human skull) were found within 1 foot of the surface,
with no evidence of other bones. A piece of askull was found within 6 inches of the
surface. Nos. 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 (a beaver tooth and four bone points) were taken from
the southern en also the broken spear heads and a conglomerated mass of human
bones. Several ribs were found between two femurs. All the skeletons found
separate (9) were lying with their heads to the west of north.”

From Mrs. B. D. Spencer, Brooklyn, N. Y. (through Dr. H. T. Cresson,
of Philadelphia, forwarded by Prot. F. W. Putnam, of Peabody Museum):
A pyrula shell with an engraving of a mastodon or grand pachyderm,
human and animal teeth, shell beads, bone implements, stone arrow
and spear heads, perforators and scrapers, and a piece of wood, show-
ing. the cutting marks of a stone ax, from the peat and fallen forest
layer and neighboring locality near Holly Oak Station, Philadelphia,
Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad, Delaware. These objects were
discovered by Dr. H. T. Cresson and M. Sarault in 1864. Seventy-
nine specimens. (Ace. 24695.)

From R. Forrer, Strasburg, Germany: Thirty-four pieces of pottery
(Samian ware) of Roman manufacture, each one having a hame stamped
upon it; and 25 pieces of Coptic cloth. (Purchased.) The name given
to these has been Coptic eloth, because they were made principally at
the city of Coptos, which was located about halfway between the cities
of Thebes and Panopolis. Thenee this commerce was carried in every
direction both through Egyptand Ethiopia, and these and similar cloths
have been found as far northas Fayum. There are evidences of Greek,
Roman and Byzantine influences. Some of the fabrics were woven in
the loom with shuttles, but others were made as tapestries. They are
usually of flax, though wool is interwoven. Silk was known in that
day, but seemed to have been such a luxury that its use was uncommon.
Some of these cloths have been described by Herodotus and Strabo.
The use of this and similar fabrics made with the loom in Egypt dates
from high antiquity. Many of these are tapestries and woven in the
Same manner as the Gobelins. They were all used as garments and
were the burial dress of their owners, having been exhumed from the
graves of the neighborhood. They date from the first to the seventh
century, A. D. These objects will be described in a separate paper.
(Ace. 24690.)

ROUTINE WORK, CLASSIFICATION AND ARRANGEMENT OF COLLECTION.

This department of the Museum, consisting, as it does, of antiquated
bones, stones, and pottery, much of it in fragments, is not attractive to
the ignorant visitor. Its objects have been known throughout historic
times without exciting public interest. If they have been gathered, it
was from curiosity. All this has been changed by the discovery of pre-
historic man. Now the objects take their proper place as evidence of
the antiquity of man, and are regarded with proper interest aud given
their true value. But this requires an understanding of the objects
and their relation—man and man’s industry. This is explanatory of
the statement that in my department visitors frequently eall upon me
for explanations, and ask my opinion upon objects, sometimes those in
the Museum, at other times those owned and brought by the visitors,
and this adds much to our routine labor. I approve this idea, and have
142 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

always done what I could to satisfy this laudable scientific curiosity on
the part of the public. I remember that this is a Museum for the peo-
ple as well as an organization for the advancement of science.

The number of entries in the loan book during the year was 26. -
Specimens entered in this book are principally sent for examination
and report, sometimes with regard to purchase, but more often classifi-
cation, probable use, ete., is desired. This requires more or less corre-
spondence with the parties sending, and after the report is made, repack-
ing and return of the specimens.

Subject to these explanations, the routine work of former years has
been kept up.

DISTRIBUTION OF DUPLICATE ARCH AOLOGICAL SPECIMENS.

The following statement indicates the distribution of archeological
specimens by the National Museum during the year ending June 30,
1892:

To Herbert E. Brock, Mason City, Lowa; 57 archeological specimens
in exchange for fossils. (Sent July 24, 1891.)

To Mrs. D. B. Meacham, Ridgway avenue, -Amidale, Cincinnati,
Ohio: 17 archeological specimens in exchange. (Sent February 11,
1892.)

To Herbert E. Brock, Mason City, lowa: 50 specimens of arrow and
spearheads, in exchange for Crinoids. (Sent March 23, 1892.)

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS
IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By FrepDERICK W. TRUE, Curator.

As regards the regular work of the department, the year covered by
this report was less productive of results than its predecessors. The
time of the Curator was occupied by other duties for one-third of the year.
The preparations for the World’s Fair were in progress, and arrange-
ments could not be made to secure the services of a skilled assistant
to replace the assistant engaged in field work. As intimated in last
year’s report, it is probable that normal conditions will not return until
after the close of the work for the World’s Fair. In the meantime
little ean be done beyond protecting the collections from deterioration.

In number and importance the accessions will compare favorably with
those of former years.* The principal accessions are here referred to:

Many foreign mammals have been obtained through the continued kindness of the
friends of the Museum, and important additions to the series of American species
have also been made in the same manner, and to a certain degree by purchase.

Dr. W. L. Abbott, to whom the Museum is indebted for a valuable colleetion of
East African mammals, supplemented his donation by a collection from Central Kash-
mir, including a fine series of skins of the Rhesus monkey, a Thibetan bear, and other
interesting species. Mr. William Astor Chanler presented two excellent mounted
heads of giraffes, a male and a female, from East Africa. A very valuable collection of
skins of marsupials, including 12 species of kangaroos and wallabies, was received
from the Australian Museum. Most of these were previously unrepresented in the
Museum collections.

Capt. M. A. Healy, U.S. Revenue Marine, obtained for the Museum the skin of a -
female walrus from Holy Cross Bay, Siberia, an excellent mate for the male obtained
last year by Capt. Coulson. Through the kind oftices of Dr. C. H. Merriam, of the
Department of Agriculture, and Mr. C. A. Townsend, of the U.S. Fish Commission, four
sea lions, Lumetopias stelleri, and two harbor seals were obtained from Monterey, Cal.
Dr. Merriam also aided the Museum in obtaining from Newfoundland three gray
seals, Halicharus grypus, a species rare in American collections. A fine adult male
hooded seal, Cystophora cristata, was obtained by Rev. M. Harvey, of St. Johns,
Newfoundland.

The Mexican Boundary Commission began field work durmeg the year. Dr. Edgar
A. Mearns, U. S. Army, who was appointed surgeon to the Commission, expressed his
desire to make zodlogieal collections for the Museum and was supplied with traps,
preservatives, and other collecting apparatus. He has entered enthusiastically into
the work and sent in from the border large collections of finely prepared specimens.

“No attention is paid at this time to the numerous specimens obtained for the
World’s Fair. These will be mentioned in next year’s report, when a detailed account

of the work done for the exhibition will be submitted.
143
144 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.
As the collections made in this region by the earlier Boundary Survey have largely |
deteriorated, this fresh material is of great interest. :

Mr. P. L. Jouy, who was detailed from the department for field work, made con-
siderable collections during the year in Southern Arizona, and in Sonora and San
Luis Potosi, Mexico. A skin of the coati, Nasua nasica, was obtained by Lieut.
John 8. Winn, U. 8. Army, in the Huachuea Mountains of Arizona. This is one of
the earliest evidences of the presence of this singular animal in the United States.

The Museum was permitted by Capt. W.H. Cassel to obtain in Druid Hill Park,
Baltimore, four Virginia deer—two buck, a doe, and a fawn. The park had become
overstocked, and it was necessary to reduce the number. <A skeleton of the white-
beaked dolphin, Lagenorhynchus albirostris, was received in exchange from Prof.
Robert Collett, of Christiania, Norway. :

The mounted skin of a dolphin, Delphinus delphis, trom Carmel Bay, California,
was purchased.

Specimens of the rare American bats, Macrotus californicus and Promops californi-
cus, were presented by Mr. George A. Allen, Indian agent in Yuma County, Ariz.
Mr. E. L. Storment also presented a specimen of the latter species and one of dAtala-
pha cinerea.

The President deposited in the Museum an armadillo sent him by Mr. R. R. Skaggs,
of Breckenridge, Tex.

A considerable collection of small mammals fromthe vicinity of Fort Snelling,
Minn., was presented by Dr. Mearns. Small mammals from Texas and California,
needed to fill gaps in the study series, were purchased from Mr. C. kK. Worthen, of
Warsaw, III

A nmmber of skeletons of species of riminants and other mammals previously un-
represented in the collections were obtained from the Muséum D’Histoire Naturelle
in exchange.

During the year more than 50 mammals, including a moose, 3 bears, 4 goats, and
other large forms, were received from the National Zodlogical Park. While the loss
of so many animals by the Park is to be regretted, if seems inseparable from enter-
prises of this kind, and isin some degree counterbalanced by the gain to the Museum,

No important changes have taken place in the exhibition hall during
the year, and no groups were added. A few skins were mounted by
the taxidermists, who have had little time, however, to devote to the
regular work of the Museum. The chief addition was a portion of
the Abbott collection, mounted by Ward’s Natural Science Establish-

ment.

The list of new mounted skins is as follows:

White-collared Mangabey, Cercocebus col-
laris.

Common Macaque, Macacus cynomolgus.

Pig-tailed Macaque, Wacacus nemestrinus,

Yagunarundi cat, Melis yaguarundi.

DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS. 145

The regular routine work of the department, identifying specimens,
cataloguing, assorting, and rearranging, was carried on as usual.
For the Department of Agriculture collection, 5,897 skins and 5,884
skulls were catalogued by our clerks. A large number of skulls of
small mammals belonging to this collection were cleaned during the
year, but Jarge numbers remain uncleaned. The Museum also made
up a considerable number of skins of foxes, skunks, coatis, peccaries,
bears, ete., belonging to this series.

No special report on the work of the taxidermists can be made with
advantage at this time. Only two taxidermists were retained on the
Museum roll during the year, and these were engaged for the greater
part of the time in work connected with the World’s Fair exhibits.
Nothing could be done to decrease the number of skins in pickle,
though it is unfortunate that some of them should remain longer
unmounted.

Mr. P. L. Jouy, formerly assistant in the department, was engaged _
in field work during the year. The explorations of Dr. Mearns have
already been referred to.

A few specimens were loaned for study or distributed during the
year. These were: To Dr. J. A. Allen, New York, 3 skins and 5 skulls
of Capromys, for study; to Mr. William Taylor, San Diego, Tex., 5
skulls of North American mammals, in exchange; to Dr. Harrison
Allen, Philadelphia, Pa., 2 skeletons of fruit bats, for study.

Identifications of North American mammals were made for Mr. G.S.
Miller, Jr., of Cambridge, Mass. Mr. G. H. Ragsdale, of Gainesville,
Tex., received information regarding the distinguishing characters of
the various species of American cats.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS
IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By Ropert RIpGWay, Curator.

GENERAL REVIEW OF THE YEAR’S WORK.

In addition to the regular routine work of the department, which of
itself is too complicated to admit of specific description, the following
special work was accomplished during the year. It may be premised
that all such work has been done at irregular intervals, or only when
time could be spared from the more exacting duties of the curator.

The working up of a collection of birds from Honduras and another
from Costa Rica was completed during July, and the results turned in
to the editor of the ** Proceedings” for publication. Considerable work
was also done, as opportunity occurred, on a revision of the genera
Sittasomus and Formicarius, besides other groups, the results of which,
so far as the work has been completed, ave mentioned by title in the
Bibliography (Section Iv).

In August, the transferring of specimens constituting the study col-
lection to new trays was begun, as was also the consideration of plans
for an exhibit of birds at the World’s Columbian Exposition, the cata-
loguing and putting away of the Richmond collection of over 5,000
specimens, the separation of duplicates from the same, and numerous
other matters.

The rearrangement of the study collection in the new cabinets was
continued in September until all the cabinets in the gallery were filled.

In April, a large collection of birds from Cashmir, presented by Dr.
W. L. Abbott, was worked up, involving considerable labor, since most
of the material was entirely new to the Museum. Much work has also
been done on a large collection of birds from the Galapagos Islands.

As time and facilities afforded, a large amount of difficult and Jabori-
ous work was performed in the rearrangement of specimens in the west
basement, where modern cabinets had been substituted for some of the
various kinds of unsuitable cases in which this extremely valuable part
of the collection had been stored. The work is far from finished. how-
ever, and can not be completed until after the World’s Fair exhibit has
been disposed of.

147
148 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

A very considerable part of the curators time was employed in the
consideration of plans and details of execution for an exhibit of birds
at the World’s Columbian Exposition. This matter was embarrassed
by many obstacles, the most serious of which was the extreme difficulty
experienced in securing competent skilled assistants. It was also
found very difficult—in some cases impossible—to obtain the necessary
inaterial; and, owing to the novel character of the work undertaken,
much time was necessarily spent inexperiment. Further time was lost
by illness of assistants; but, all these hindrances taken into considera-
tion, the progress of the work has been satisfactory, and unless the
value of the exhibit is impaired by material reduction of its extent, a
highly interesting and instructive collection will be produced.

NOTES UPON THE MORE IMPORTANT ACCESSIONS RECEIVED DURING
THE YEAR.

The number of specimens entered in the Museum register of birds
during the year 1891-792 is 5,608 (catalogue numbers 120753 to 126349,

ROUTINE WORK.

A considerable part of what might properly be included under this
heading has been already mentioned.

The number of specimens mounted during the year (exclusive of those
mounted for the World’s Fair exhibit) is 276,and of specimens made
into skins, 35. These totals are less than for the year 189091, for the
reason that a considerable portion of the taxidermist’s (Mr. Marshall’s)
time was devoted to work on the World’s Fair exhibit.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES.

Under this heading may be mentioned chiefly the curator’s work upon
collections from Honduras, Costa Rica, the Galapagos Archipelago,
Cashmir, ete., and upon special groups, as the genus Formicarius;
Dr. Stejneger’s upon collections from Japan and the Sandwich Islands;
Mr. J. A. Allen’s on the genus Colaptes, and Mr. Frank M. Chapman’s
upon the Genus Quiscalus. Some of these investigations have not been
concluded; but the results of others have been published. (See biblio-
raphy, Section Lv.)

PRESENT STATE OF THE COLLECTION.

The present state of the collection is considerably improved over that
of last year, _ ‘ving to the far more convenient arrangement of the larger
part in modern cabinets. A considerable portion (much the bulkier
part, though numerically less) has yet to be rearranged, the work having
been retarded by the preparation of the World’s Fair exhibit as well
as by want of cases. It will, however, be resumed at as early a date
as possible, and it is to be hoped that by the end of the current year
the entire study collection may be putin a thoroughly systematic state,
and the duplicates separated and classified, so that by next year an
extensive distribution of sets can be made.

The number of specimens coutained in the collection at the end of
June, 1892, is shown in the following table:

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF OOLOGY
IN THE U.8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By Cuartes E. BeNpIRE, U. 8. Army (retired), Honorary Curator.

Tam pleased to be able to state that the collection is now in excellent
shape, easy of access, and reasonably safe from insects and vermin.
During the past year thirty new quarter unit zinc-lined and insect- proof
cases have been furnished for its accommodation, and the entire collec-
tion has been carefully overhauled, rearranged, and relabeled. The
majority of the specimens now on hand in the reserve collection are in
an excellent state of preservation, and as at present cared for will re-
main so.

The exhibit of nests and eggs in the main hall of the Smithsonian
Institution could now be materially increased, if more.room was avail-
able for this purpose.

The most important contributions to the collection -during the year
are as follows:

Dr. Wm. L. Ralph, 26 Court street, Utica, N. Y., a magnificent collection, consist-
ing of 444 sets of eggs, representing 194 species and 1,630 specimens. Among
these are several species new to the collection; many others are very rare and
have been especial desiderata for years, and all are beautifully prepared.  Ac-
companying these eges are 100 nests, also in an excellent state of preservation.
This collection is by far the most valuable gift received since I have been in
charge of the department.

Mr. R. MacFarlane, chief factor, Hudson Bay Company, Cumberland House, Sas-
katchewan, Canada, an interesting collection of 59 sets of eggs represented by
225 specimens and 30 nests. This donation is of considerable scientific value, as
it extends the breeding range of several species considerably to the northward.

U.S. Department of Agriculture, Washington, D. C., a valuable collection, consist-
ing of 40 sets, 113 specimens, and 17 nests. from the Death Valley region im south-
ern California, Nevada, and Utah, and containing a number of rare specimens.

Interesting accessions have also been received as follows:

Mr. Guy E. Mitchell, Washington, D.C., a local collection, consisting of 59 sets and
239 specimens.

Mr. Walter F. Webb, Geneva, N. Y., 39 sets, numbering 137 specimens and 10 nests.

Assist? Surg. Edgar A. Mearns, U.S. Army, Fort Snelling, Minn., 46 sets, number-
ing 177 specimens and 20 nests.

U.S. Fish Commission (Washington, D. C.), 9 sets, 29specimens, and 2 nests.

Mr. Charles Littlejohn, Redwood City, Cal., 21 sets, 42 specimens, and 1 nest,

Mr. H. P. Attwater, Rockport, Aransas County, Tex., 11 sets, 56 eggs, and 3 nests.

In addition to these donations 37 specimens, representing 7 species, were purchased
during the year.

The routine work has consisted in recording, marking, measuring,
and arranging 2,919 specimens received during the year, and placing
them in their proper order in the reserve collection. Also revising and
rearranging in numerical order 382 register sheets, showing the present
status of the collection, and overhauling and rearranging the collection
of nests.

The curator has also been engaged in reading proof of Vol. 1, Life
Histories of North American Birds, ete., compiling the index for this
volume, and in gathering material for another volume. Twenty-nine
lots of eggs sent tor identification have been reported on.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By LEONHARD STEJNEGER, Curator.

The herpetological department has every reason to look upon the
year 1891-92 with satisfaction. The number of accessions was larger
than during any previous year, 1,055 specimens having been entered,*
and the material was not inferior, nor were the collections of less in-
terest. Several very interesting species were added to the collection,
some very rare or for the first time, others hitherto undescribed.
Among the latter I would call special attention to a very remarkable
blind cave salamander, discovered by Mr. F. A. Sampson in the Rock
House Cave, Missouri, and described by me as Typhlotriton speleus.
It is related to Desmognathus, but its eyes; by disuse, have become
non-functional; the eyelids closed over and grew together, and now
there is only a shallow furrow and a dark spot left to designate ex-
ternally the place of the eye. The Proteus, from the grottoes in Kaern-
then, Austria, is the only other batrachian hitherto known to be blind
in the same way, but it belongs to a different order, and Typhlotriton
is so far the only known blind salamander. Of rare species L may
mention a fine specimen of Plethodon a@neus, from South Pittsburg,
Tenn., transmitted by Mr. R. Morton Middleton, and several specimens
of another salamander recently described, viz, Spelerpes maculicaudus,
received from Dr. O. P. Hay, and from Messrs. Frederick C. Test and
George E. Harris. The principal accessions will, however, be referred
to further on.

The work in the department has consisted chiefly of routine work,
installing, identifying, caring for, labeling, and reporting upon collec-
tions as they have arrived. The curator has attempted some work
upon certain groups and upon the geographical distribution of the
reptiles in the southwestern portion of the country, but a consistent
and steady systematic work has been out of the question.

At the beginning of the last fiscal year it was decided to take up
the many collections received during the last ten years and stored in

*For comparison it may be mentioned that the number of entries in 1890—91 was
908; in 1889-’90, 705; in 1888-89, 784; 1m 1887-’88, 19; in 1886-’87, 138.

156 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

bulk. As soon as jars and alcohol had been provided, the work of as-
sorting and labeling was begun, and has continued steadily at such
times as could be spared from the daily routine work. The work is
slow, involving, as it does, not only the labor of handling, consulting
the records, labeling, and card-cataloguing, but also a great deal of
identifying.

Some time has been spent in preparations for a herpetological dis-
play at the World’s Columbian Exposition. Thanks to Mr. Benedict’s
experiments, a plastic and pliable substitute for plaster was obtained
for making the casts of reptiles and batrachians.

By tar the most valuable and interesting collection, not only of
the year, but since the Wheeler Survey west of the one hundredth
meridian in the seventies, and ranking with those of the famous old
exploring expeditions in the West, is the material received from Dr. C.
Hart Merriam, through the United States Department of Agriculture,
and collected by him and his parties during the so-called “ Death Val-
ley Expedition,” 1891. It consists of more than 900 specinens (only a
small portion, however, having been entered on the register before the
end of the year), chiefly from the desert regions of California and
Nevada, but many also from Utah, and quite a number from the great
interior basin of California. A special report upon this collection has
been prepared by the curator.

In addition to the collections mentioned in last year’s report, as made
by Mr. P. L. Jouy in southern Arizona, quite a number of specimens
were received from him during the present fiscal year. The excellent
quality of his collections and of his field observations are quite as
inarked in the latter as in the former.

From the same souree the Museum procured the only extra-limital
collection worth mentioning, viz, a number of reptiles and batrach-
ians collected by Mr. Jouy during his stay in Korea several years ago.
Very little is known of the herpetology of that rather inaccessible
country, and the collection is therefore one of unusual interest.

The type specimen of Typhlotriton speleus, the blind cave salaman-
der, presented by Mr. F. A. Sampson, of Sedalia, Mo., has already been
mentioned, but I may add that we are indebted to Mr. George EK, Harris,
of Cassville, Mo., for numerous larvee of the same interesting species.

Many other valuable and interesting species have been received dur-
ing the year from various correspondents, which can not be enumerated
in detail in the present connection, but among the more prominent con-
tributors the following deserve mention: Herbert Brown, Tucson,
Ariz.; Prof. B. W. Evermann, through U. 8. Fish Commission; J. D.
Figgins, Washington, D. C.; Dr. O. P. Hay, Irvington, Ind.; H. W.
Henshaw, Washington, D. C.; Julius Hurter, St. Louis, Mo.; It. Mor-
ton Middleton, South Pittsburg, Tenn.; Charles W. Richmond, Wash-
ington, D. C.; N. P. Scudder, Linden, Md.; Edgar Storment, Tempe,
Ariz.; Dr. Timothy E. Wilcox, U. 8. A., Fort Huachuca, Ariz.
DEPARTMENT OF REPTILES AND BATRACHIANS. US Y/

Facilities for studying the collections, so far as they were accessible,
have been extended toseveral gentlemen not connected with the Museum.
Dr. O. P. Hay spent more than a month in the department study-
ing the reptiles of Indiana. Dr. G. Baur, of Clark University, Wor-
cester, Mass., spent considerable time at the Museum working up
the collection of Chelonians for his proposed work on the tortoises of
North America, to be published by the Museum.

The work on the proposed supplementary volume of the “ Nomenclator
Zoologicus” has advanced satisfactorily. The genera and subgenera
recorded in the Zodlogical Records for 1879-1889 have been card-cata-
logued during the year, and the work of indexing the additional names
contained in the Zoologische Jahresberichte has been commenced.

Mr. Frederick ©. Test has been employed as an aid to the department
during the entire year. One half of his time has been devoted to work
on the Nomenclator Zoologicus, the other half chiefly to routine work
in the department.

During the year that part of the Museum collection which was
brought home by the naturalists of the U.S. Fish Commission steamer
Albatross from the Galapagos Islands was recalled from Prof. Cope.
A large quantity of material is, however, still in his possession, and an
accurate census of the herpetological specimens of the Museum is there-
fore as impracticable as it was last year. Like that presented a year
ago, the following estimate has been prepared in this way: taking last
year’s estimate as a basis, those specimens which have been disposed
of by exchange, or otherwise, have been deducted, and those which
have been catalogued during the fiscal year have been added. Such
an estimate shows the status of the collection on June 30, 1892, to be
as follows:

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FISHES
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892,

By TARLETON H. BEAN, Honorary Curator.

The work accomplished in this department has been in many respects
generally similar to that of preceding years. My own duties in con-
nection with the U.S. Fish Commission have rendered 1t impossible
for me to devote much time to Museum matters, and the routine work
of the department has devolved almost entirely upon Mr. Barton A.
Bean, assistant curator. .

The curator has assisted Dr. Goode in the preparation of a bulletin
upon the deep-sea fishes contained in the U.S. National Museum, and
the work was pushed rapidly forward during the fall of 1891.

Several hundred skeletons of fishes were prepared for the depart-
ment by Mr. E. KE. Howell. These have been turned over to Dr. Theo-
dore Gill, temporarily, for study.

There has been a marked increase in the number of letters received
through the Assistant Secretary’s office. These for the most part con-
tain queries concerning the fishes of various portions of the country,
and the questions as a rule have been promptly answered. Others
bring information of much importance concerning fishes and their life
histories. Intelligent correspondents are much desired, and the policy
of encouragement to such is strongly recommended.

A number of students examined materials belonging to the Museum
(Drs. Gill, Jordan, Gilbert, EKigenmann, Smith, and Profs. Evermann,
Hay, and others). Collections and papers based upon the same were
received from numerous correspondents, a list of which will be found
in the Bibliography (Section Tv).

Quite a large number of drawings of deep-sea fishes have been made
by Mr. A. H. Baldwin. An important addition to the sectional library
was made by the purchase of four volumes of Dr. Bleeker’s ‘“ Atlas
Ichthyologique,” which completes the set of that work.

The explorations here referred to resulted in the addition of impor-
tant collections of fishes for the National Museum:

The U.S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross cruised in the North
Pacific and Bering Sea during the summer of 1891 and the spring of
1892. During the winter of 1891 and 1892 the vessel was engaged in
the survey of a cable route from California to the Sandwich Islands.
On these cruises collections of fishes were made.

159
160 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

The steamer Fish Tawhk was engaged in the lower Chesapeake Bay,
where small collections were obtained.

The schooner Grampus did general collecting in the lower Chesa-
peake and in the coast waters adjacent thereto.

Prot. B. W. Evermann, for the U. 8S. Fish Commission, collected
fishes in Montana and Wyoming during July and August, 1891,

Profs. J. T. Scovell and A. J. Woolman made some collections in
northern Mexico during August, 1891. Mr. P. L. Jouy collected in
Mexico (Lake Chapala, principally), in February and April, 1892.

Mr. Charles W. Richmond sent from Nicaragua collections made in
February, March and April, 1892.

The total number of packages sent out during the year, not including
the sets of duplicate fishes, was twenty-four. The most important were:

Thirty-seven species of deep-sea fishes to the Royal Museum of
Copenhagen, Denmark, in exchange; a large series of fishes to be skele-
tohized; and seven species of Seopelids and a tile-fish to the Museum
of Comparative Zodlogy at Cambridge, Mass.

Fifty-five sets of duplicate fishes were prepared and turned over to
the registrar. The specimens were all carefully wrapped, and each set
contained about 125 species, both fresh and salt water forms. <A list to
accompany each set was printed.

The number of specimens added to the collections of fishes during
the year was 1,906. The first entry in the register was No. 43603, the
last 44156, making a total of 555 entries.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS
(INCLUDING CENOZOIC FOSSILS)
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By WiLLiAM H. DaLi, Honorary Curator.

The force of the Department of Mollusks during the past year has
comprised, besides the honorary curator, Mr, Charles Torrey Simpson,
aid, Mr. S. Hazen Bond, copyist, and Miss N. C. Beard, copyist. Dr.
R. E. C. Stearns, of the U. S. Geological Survey, honorary adjunct
curator, has been absent on sick leave during nearly the whole year,
so that we have not had the advantage of his valuable aid and advice
in the work of the department. The three persons mentioned above
have comprised the salaried force of the department. Mr. Gilbert D.
Harris and Mr, Frank Burns, of the U.S. Geological Survey, in the
course of their work on the tertiary invertebrate fossils, have rendered
incidental assistance on that part of the collection. The writer, with
the permission of the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey, has con-
tinued to act as honorary curator.

The members of the force have been diligent, faithful, and accurate
in their work, and My. Simpson especially has devoted much time out-
side of ordinary office hours to forwarding the work of the department
and assisting its numerous correspondents. ;

GENERAL OPERATIONS.

The routine work of the year has made considerable progress. The
number of registrations which are tabulated in another place in this
report is less numerous than for some years previous, because more time
has been devoted to putting the collection of duplicates in order and to
other matters set forth below. As the arrears of material not admin-
istered upon have been reduced, the number of duplicates has increased,
and it has for some time been obvious that in order to make the ex-
changes often called for, and to keep informed as to the state of duplicate
material, it was urgently required that the latter should be putin order
for reference. Much of the time of Mr. Simpson and Mr. Bond has been
devoted to sorting, naming, cataloguing, and putting away the duplicate

163

shells in numbered boxes. A large proportion of the duplicates is now
packed in small boxes in the storage-room, each bearing its catalogue
number, the last box entry being No. 2035, while a card-catalogue,
alphabetically arranged under the names of the species, makes it possi-
ble to refer at a moment’s notice to any duplicates in the collection.
Some few marine collections remain to be reviewed and the duplicates
eliminated, but the great mass of duplicate recent and fossil shells are
now arranged in orderly and accessible condition, occupying over 1,700
boxes, each plainly marked with its registration number and name.

The drawings, published and unpublished, are becoming so numer-
ous that here also cataloguing and arrangement have become necessary.
A list.in the form of a card-catalogue, had been made of all the wood.
cuts and stereotypes of mollusks illustrated in the Smithsonian Reports
and in the Proceedings and Bulletins of the Museum (with certain excep-
tions). Stout manilla envelopes, of the same size as the standard library
card, have been used to contain original drawings, whether published
or unpublished, while in a blank form, stamped on the outside of the
envelope, is noted the catalogue number of the drawing, the registra-
tion number (in the Museum register), name, and provenance of the
specimen from which the drawimg was made, together with the publi-
cation, volume, plate, figure, number, and page reference of the engrav-
ing made from the drawing, if published. The latter data are entered
on library cards in cases where the engraving exists, but the drawing
is notextant. These cards and envelopes are arranged together alpha-
betically under the name of the species, in two series, one comprising
the published and the other the unpublished drawings, so that refer-
ence can be had immediately to the data relating to any species which
have been drawn, or of which a figure has been published in the publi-
cations of the Museum or of the Smithsonian Institution. The excep-
tions to this comprise the figures which have appeared in Bulletin 37,
U.S. National Museum, which contains over a thousand figures; those
figures which are contained in the series of Smithsonian manuals of
land and fresh-water shells in the Miscellaneous Collections of the Insti-
tution, and a set of stereotype figures derived from the British Museum
publications. As the cuts above named are indexed in the publications
referred to, and thus easily reached, it was not thought worth while
to undertake the considerable labor of adding them to the catalogue
until other more pressing matters are out of the way.

The amount of labor involved in these various directions can be
better appreciated if placed in tabular form as follows:

Tt will be observed that this is equal to 5,171 registrations, so far as
the clerical labor is concerned, and if we add to it the regular entries
for the year in the Museum Register, we have a total of about 7,700
entries as against about 5,800 for 1890-91. As the staff, by reason of
Dr. Stearns’ absence was diminished by one person, the equivalent at
the lowest estimate of 25 per cent of its efficiency, this record may be
regarded as satisfactory.

Besides the work above referred to, the general operations of the
department comprise the preparation of special reports on collections
made under governmental auspices by various organizations, such as
the Fish Commission, the Navy, the Revenue Marine, the Agricultural
Department, and special expeditions. In this line various papers have
been printed by the writer and other members of the staff, a reference
to which will be found in the Bibliography (Section rv). Among them
is a paper forming Part G of Bulletin 59 of the U.S. National Museum,
containing instructions for collecting and preserving mollusks, notes
on the arrangement, outfit, and cataloguing of collections, and the con-
struction of dredges. This it is thought will be of use to collectors be-
ginning work on the Mollusca, and will save much clerical work in
writing out such instructions at short notice, as has been required fre-
quently in the past on the starting of expeditions undertaking natural
history work.

ACCESSIONS.

The number of accesssions during 1891~92 was 85, against 79 in
189091. Severalof them comprised large series of valuable and inter-
esting forms, many of which are new to the collection. Among the
most interesting the following may be noted:

From Mr. C. F. Ancey were received a number of rare and peculiar species from
Africa, including several of the forms found only in the south African Lake Tangan-
yika.

Mr. W. G. Binney presented the blocks of figures used in his publications of the
past two years, thus making them available for use in future publications of the
Museum.

Mr. R. W. Brown, of Washington, has continued to present to the Museum the
numerous land-snails, ete., which are found from time to time in his importations of
foreign fruit, so that we have had the opportunity of observing in a living state in
an improvised snailery, several of the peculiar types of Antillean pulmonates.

The heirs of the late Oliver N. Bryan, of Marshall Hall, Md., in accordance with
his wish presented his collection of fossils, Indian relies, ete., to the National Mu-
seum, by which quite a number of fine and interesting fossil mollusks fell to the share
of this department.

To Dr. J. C. Cox, of Sydney, New South Wales, through Mr. Charles Hedley of the
Australianmuseum, weare indebted for alcoholic specimens of the remarkable Ephip-
podonta Macdougallii Tate, a bivalve related to Galeomma and on which an investi-
gation of its anatomy may be based.

Through Mr. Hugh Fulton, of London, by exchange and purchase a number of rari-
ties not otherwise obtainable have been received, including a fine specimen of the
extremely rare Voluta aulica which formerly belonged to the Barelay collection.
166 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

From Mr. I. Greegor, of Jacksonville, Fla., a number of interesting specimens have
been received, mostly from Florida and the Antilles.

Mr. Simpson, of the department of mollusks, joined Mr. J. B. Henderson, jr., on an
expedition to the west coast of Florida, which proved fruitful in results. A series of
the specimens collected, so far as they might be useful to the Museum, was presented
by Mr. Henderson.

Two large series of Japanese mollusks have been received during the year. These
accessions greatly enrich that department of the collection, each containing several
rarities which were not comprised in the other. One of these was the gift of the
Rey. H. Loomis, of Yokohama, and the other was received in exchange for other
specimens sent to Frederick Stearns, esq., of Detroit, Mich., who supplemented it by
other forms from Mauritius and the Hawaiian Islands.

Another gift which is highly appreciated was a set of several hundred species from
St. Helena, probably illustrating the whole of its mollusk fauna, including the curious
extinct land shells. This very interesting contribution was received from Capt.
W.H. Turton, of the Royal Engineers, Chatham, England. The collection of which
chis is a representative set was reported on at length by Mr. E. A. Smith, of the Brit-
ish Museum.

The extinct fresh-water mollusk fauna of the Colorado desert has always been of
great interest. One by one the species have been found living in springs, to which
they retreated on the desiccation of the ancient lake. One alone remained to be dis-
covered, Tryonia clathrata of Stimpson; and among the collections of the expedition
to Death Valley made by Dr. C. Hart Merriam under the auspices of the U.S.
Department of Agriculture this has been at last secured, living in a spring with a
water temperature of 97° F. in the Pahranagat Valley. This is certainly one of the
most interesting malacological events of the year.

Through the efforts of the Hon. Rounsevelle Wildman, United States consul at
Singapore, a collection representing the chief marine forms of that vicinity was
obtained from native collectors.

Mr. Joseph Willcox, of Philadelphia, has continued to contribute to the collection
of Tertiary fossils, and has enriched it by a number of species from the Tertiaries of
the Carolinas and Florida.

ASSISTANCE TO STUDENTS.

The work of assisting students in various parts of the country to
identify their local faunze, to intelligently direct their studies, and
answer their numerous queries on various branches of the subject, has
always been regarded as an important function of this department, and
has been frequently referred to in the previous reports. Correspondence
of this kind was kept up in 1890-91 with 160 persons, involving over 300
letters and between 600 and 700 pages of writing, besides the identifica-
tion of about 1,200 species of mollusks. In 1891-’92 the number of cor-
respondents was 114, and the number of pages of writing involved in
the correspondence 820. The number of species identified for various
students, chiefly by Mr. Simpson, under my direction, amounts to con-
siderably over 3,000, for each of which a label had to be written.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES.

A reference to the Bibliography (section Iv) will indicate the direc-
tion of the studies carried on during the year. The report on the later
Tertiary of the United States and Mr. Simpson’s paper on Floridian
DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS. 167

Unios, though printed, will be issued a few days too late to appear in
the Bibliography of this year. The principal labor of the year has been
bestowed on the continuation of the report on the Florida Tertiary Mol-
lusks, for the Wagner Institute, of Philadelphia; preliminary work on
the mollusks of the Galapagos trip of the U.S. Fish Commission
steamer Albatross, and also those collected by Dr. G. Baur; and on the
Unionide, to which group Mr. Simpson is giving special attention.

STATE OF THE COLLECTION.

In previous reports I have explained why it is not yet possible to
give the exact number of species, specimens, duplicates, ete., contained
in the collection under my charge. In my last report it was estimated
that the collection contained about 476,500 specimens, of which one-
fourth are preserved in alcohol. During the year about 6,225 speci-
mens have been received, which would make a present total of about
482,725 specimens contained in the collection. The number of entries
in the register for 1891-92 was 2,546, as is Shown in the accompanying
table.

The total number of registrations to date, deducting all duplications
and omissions in the register, is 103,113, representing about 309,000
specimens. The number of workers and their distribution in different
parts of the building renders it necessary to use simultaneously several
volumes of the register. This explains why the preceding table is nec-
essary in order to show the total registrations for the year. The formal
registrations (with the gaps alluded to) terminates June 30, 1892, with
number 124,662.
REPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VERTEBRATE FOSSILS
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By 0. C. Marsu, Honorary Curator.

The most important event in this department of the Museum during
the past year has been the accession of a large collection of vertebrate
fossils from the West. secured by the honorary curator during his
official work for the U. S. Geological Survey. These specimens were
prepared in New Haven, sent to the National Museam in July, 1891,
and placed at once on exhibition, so as to be accessible to the members
of the International Geological Congress, which met in Washington
in August of that year. This collection of fossils, which is more exten-
sive and important than any other hitherto received by the Museum,
is arranged in a wall-case especially constructed for it, extending the
entire length of the east side of the exhibition room.

These specimens, selected by the honorary curator as the first instal-
ment of his official collections to be placed in the National Museum,
are all of large size, and especially characteristic of three important
geological horizons of the West. The ceratops beds of the upper Cre-
taceous of Wyoming are here represented by three skulls and other
rare remains of the gigantic horned dinosaurs recently deseribed, and
among these fossils is the type of Triceratops elatus Marsh. From the
Brontotherium beds of Nebraska and Dakota is shown a very complete
series of skulls and portions of skeletons of the huge Miocene mam-
mals of the family Brontotheride. This series contains ten good skulls
representing several genera, and is by far the most important collee-
tion of the group ever placed on exhibition. The horizon of the Plio-
cene, known as the Pliohippus beds, is likewise represented by skulls
and other remains of extinct species of the Rhinoceros family, espe-
cially of the genus Aceratherium, all from Phillips County, Kans. A
few other Tertiary fossils and some rare casts are included in this eol-
lection, but the limited space available prevented the exhibition of a
more extensive series.

This collection, when sent from New Haven in 33 boxes, weighed
6,860 pounds. It has now been catalogued and well arranged by Mr.
F. A. Lucas, assistant curator, whose services in other respects have

169
170 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

been of great value to the department. The catalogue numbers em-
bracing this collection extend from 1201 to 1582, as recorded in the
National Museum register of vertebrate fossils. The greater part of
this collection was obtained by Mr. J. B. Hatcher, and a careful record
of all the localities has been preserved.

Another important collection of 72 large boxes of vertebrate fossils,
sent from New Haven in 1886 by the honorary curator, still remains in
storage, as there is no room for its exhibition in the National Museum
The Smithsonian numbers of these boxes are 6601 to 6672.

The honorary curator of this department has recommended to the
director of the Museum that other wall-cases for vertebrate fossils be
constructed on the three remaining sides of the exhibition room, as this
space will be needed eventually, if the specimens already secured and
now under investigation are all placed on exhibition. One side could
then appropriately be devoted to the extinet reptiles of the Triassic
and Jurassic, another to those from the Cretaceous, while the third
and fourth would be required for the vertebrate fossils of the Tertiary
alone.

During the past year the honorary curator of this department has
published a number of papers relating, in part, to the collections above
described, but these publications belong more appropriately to his
work in connection with the U. S. Geological Survey. In two memoirs
now in preparation, however, he will give full descriptions of the more
important specimens he has recently deposited in the National Museum.

The collection of vertebrate fossils, which has been catalogued partly
with the osteological specimens and partly in a separate book, has
been recatalogued during the year in a volume specially devoted to
vertebrate fossils.

During the year 1,124 catalogue entries were made, and 1,061 speci-
mens were added to the collection.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS IN
THE U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By C. V. RILEY, Honorary Curator.

Although most of the time during the past fiscal year has been
devoted to the study collections in the laboratory, some improvements
have been made in the exhibit collections, especially in the systematic
series, where numerous illustrations and specimens have been added,
making it almost complete.

ACCESSIONS.

Many important accessions have been received during the year,
among which the following may be mentioned:

(1) One hundred and thirty-five species in about 400 specimens of Heteroptera,
collected in various parts of the world, authoritatively named, from Prof. A. L. Mon-
tandon, Bucarest, Roumania (Ace, 24579, 25244, and 25520). These have in part been
paid for by exchange.

(2) Series of Californian insects, collected by Mr. D. W. Coquillet, of Los Angeles,
Cal., and transferred to the Museum collection by the curator, as follows: Diptera,
23 species in 182 specimens (Types); Coleoptera, about 100 species in 720 specimens ;
Orthoptera, 35 species in 116 specimens; Hymenoptera, 109 species in 400 specimens;
Homoptera, 40 species in 200 specimens; Hemiptera, 107 species in 575 specimens;
Lepidoptera, 56 species in 159 specimens; Neuroptera, 17 species in 43 specimens;

the largest acquisition of tropical butterflies ever made by the Museum. It was
obtained by exchange for a corresponding number of North American Coleoptera
from our duplicate series, that were new to Mr. Beyer’s collection. This one and
the previous accession are the most valuable during the year. (Acc. 25378.)

(5) Collection of Aculeate Hymenoptera, about 4,000 specimens of 675 North Ameri-
can species (including types of 25 species described by Mr. William Fox), and 100
exotic species from Mr. William Fox, Academy Natural Sciences, Philadelphia. Pur-
chased by the Museum. (Ace. 25769.)

(6) Collection of insects of all orders, made by Mr. H. F. Wickham in the North-
western States, British Columbia, and Alaska. About 1,200 specimens, transferred

Ariz. (Acc, 24915.)

Numerous valuable specimens have been added to the collections
without accession numbers by the curator and his assistants.

As atemporary accession may be mentioned a large collection of West
Indian Hemiptera and parasitic Hymenoptera, sent to the curator for
systematic study by the West India Committee of the British Museum,

lowing:

(a) A series of 57 species of Scolytidae for Dr. Wm. Eichhoff, Stras-
burg, Germany, in return for Ace. 25498.

(b) A series of 35 species of Scolytide for A. D. Hopkins, Morgan-
town, W. Va.

(c) A series of 900 species of Coleoptera for Mr. G, Beyer, New York,
in return for Ace, 25378.

(d) A series of Hemiptera for Prof. A. I. Montandon, Bucharest,
Roumania.

(e) A series of 24 species of Coleoptera for Mr. F. C. Bowditch,
Brookline, Mass., in return for Ace. 25593.

(f) Sixty-nine species of Elateride for Mr. H.de Buysson, Chateau
de Vernet, Allier, Irance.

(2) Reporting on accessions sent for examination and report. One hun-
dred and seventy-two of these reports have been made duving the year.
DEPARTMENT OF INSECTS. 3

(3) The naming of specimens for collectors. Fifty-two larger and
smaller series of insects of all orders have been identified for corre-
spondents, representing about 5,000 species.

(4) The selection of material to be sent to specialists for study and
determination, as here indicated :

(a) A series of Californian Hemiptera-Heteroptera has been sent to
Prof. A. L. Montandon of Bucarest, Roumania.

(b) The material in the Noctuid genera Xylomiges and Cucullia was
sent to Prof. J. B. Smith, New Brunswick, N. J., to assist him in his
study of these groups.

(c) A series of Geometridxe, mostly collected in the Death Valley,
California, was sent to Dr. A. 8. Packard, of Providence, for determina-
tion.

(d) A small series of Diurnals was sent to Mr. W. H. Edwards for
determination.

(e) Several smaller series and all the Odonata, collected by Dr. Ab-
bott in Africa, have been sent to Dr. P. C. Calvert, Academy Natura
Sciences, Philadelphia, for systematic study.

(f) A complete representation of the Museum collection in the Rhyn-
chophorus Tribe Barini has been sent to Capt. T. L. Casey, New York,
who has undertaken to monograph the group.

(g) A series of Geometride bas been sent to Rev. George D. Hulst,
Brooklyn, N. Y., for identification.

(h) All the material in the Hemipterous family Veliide has been
borrowed by Mr. H. E. Summers for study.

(t) The undetermined Lepidoptera collected in Africa by Dr. W. L.
Abbott have been sent to Dr. W. J. Holland, Pittsburg, Pa., for study.
(5) The work of arranging in permanent shape all the collections.

In the Diptera, mentioned in the last annual report as being for the
most part arranged, the remaining families have been classified as far
as they are studied in our fauna. In the Lepidoptera the North Ameri-
can Diurnals, Sphingid, Bombyecid, and Geometrid families have been
completely rearranged according to the last published classification,
and the very large accessions incorporated. Of North American Diur-
nals 410 species are represented, and of Geometrids about 290 North
American and 162 European species. A systematic arrangement has
also been made of the tropical Diurnals, and they are represented as
follows:

In the Hymenoptera some of the families have been studied and the
accessions incorporated.

Much time is taken up by this work, as a large percentage of the acces-
sions arrive unmounted and all have to be labeled before distribution
in the collections.

RESEARCHES.

Most of the special researches based upon museum material are
mentioned under the paragraph relating to routine work. In addi-
tion to these, however, Mr. W. H. Ashmead has completed his mon-
ograph of the Proctotrypide of North America, based very largely
on Museum material. This is the first monograph written upon the
American representations of this group.

Dr. George Marx has had at his disposal the Acarians of the family.
Ixodidie, belonging to the collection, and is engaged upon a monograph
of the family.

PRESENT STATE OF THE COLLECTION.

During the last year about 16,000 specimens have been added to the
collection. The last catalogue entry for June, 1891, is 746, and for
June, 1892, is 1,041. The whole collection was carefully examined for
museum pests during the month of June, and was found to be ina
highly satisfactory condition.
REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES
IN THE U. 8S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892,

By RICHARD RATHBUN, Honorary Curator.

Much progress has been made during the past year in the study of the
collections belonging to this department, especially of the higher crusta-
ceans, and in the preparation of reports relating to them. As the west
hall of the Smithsonian Institution has remained closed during this
entire period, owing to delays in the completion of the repairs, it has
not been possible to take any active steps toward the improvement of
the exhibition series, although a very fair display has been maintained
in the temporary quarters allotted for this purpose in the fish hall ad-
jacent. There has been a marked increase over the previous year in
the number as well as in the aggregate extent and value of the acces-
sions which have been received from many diverse sources. Much
time has necessarily been required in caring for these additions, and in
attending to the continued preservation of the general collections,
which have now attained so large a size as to severely tax the storage
accommodations assigned to them. But few changes have been made
in the quarters occupied by this department, and they remain there-
fore in essentially the same condition as described in the last report.

The curator has exercised only a general supervision over the affairs
of the department, leaving to the assistant curator, Mr. James E. Bene-
dict, and to Miss M. J. Rathbun, the burden of the work, which has been
attended to, as heretofore, in the most thorough and conscientious
manner.

The total number of accessions received was forty-six. The largest
contribution was made by the U.S. Fish Commission and consisted
mainly of crustaceans, chiefly brachyura and anomoura, represented by
many species and a very large number of specimens, the same having
been collected by the steamer Albatross in the North Pacific Ocean
and Bering Sea; by the steamer Fish Hawk and the schooner Grampus
on the Atlantic sea coast, and by Prof. B. W. Evermann in Texas. It
also included a small collection of avian entozoa made by Prof. Edwin
Linton in the Yellowstone National Park.

175
176 | REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

The other more important accessions were the followmg: From the
Australian Museum, Sydney, New South Wales, 24 species of Aus-
tralian echini, 14 of which were new to our collection, 13 species of As-
teroidea and 50 species of brachyura and anomoura; the Rev. Ganon A.
M. Norman, of England, 22 species of European Paguridie and Pyeno-
gonidie; Mr. George S. Brady, England, a named series of British fresh-
water Cyclopide; Rev. H. Loomis, a large dried collection of erusta-
ceans, echinoderms and sponges, from Japan; the Otago Museum, Dune-
din, a collection of New Zealand crustaceans; Mr. John Murray, Edin-
burgh, Scotland, many specimens of hermit crabs, Hupagurus, from the
Firth of Clyde; Mr. P. L. Jouy, a number of fresh-water crabs and
crayfishes from Lake Chapala, Mexico, and crustaceans, echini, and
worms from Guaymas; Dr. T. H. Morgan, of Bryn Mawr College, a coL
lection of crustaceans from Jamaica; O. F. Cook and H. R. Jaquay, a
series of Oniscidie from different parts of the United States; the King-
ston Exposition, Kingston, Jamaica, a large and very fine series of
dried specimens of commercial sponges; J. C. Henderson, jr., and C. T.
Simpson, a miscellaneous assortment of crustaceans from the west coast
of Florida; Lieut. F. E. Sawyer, U.S. Navy, Brazilian crustaceans ob-
tained during a trip in connection with the World’s Columbian Expo-
sition. The remaining contributions, while of smaller size than those
enumerated, have also added many valuable specimens to the collection.

Two half-unit upright cases filled with large jars of especially inter-
esting alcoholic specimens, such as crinoids, deep-sea pennatule, echi-
noderms, and crabs, have been added to the exhibition series in the fish
hall, and Mr. Benedict has also experimented in the matter of making
dried preparations of crustaceans for display purposes. This it is not
generally difficult to accomplish with the brachyurans or true crabs, but
the hermit crabs and shrimps are less amenable to such treatment, owing
to their thinner shells and more delicate appendages. It is expected,
however, that entirely satisfactory specimens can be prepared by care-
ful treatment, and if the trials now being made turn out successfully it is
proposed to increase the display collection. Another direction in which
experimental work is being conducted by Mr. Benedict has reference to
the manufacture of a plastic substance suitable for making reproduce-
tions of the softer animals and sufficiently durable for exhibition pur-
poses. His eftorts have already met with much success and promise im-
portant results not only for this, but also for several of the other de-
partments of the Museum.

The customary routine work of the department, such as the mainte-
nance of the collections, the periodical overhauling of all the speci-
mens to insure their preservation by the renewal of alcohol or the
removal of Museum pests, the assorting of recent additions, their cata-
loguing, labeling, ete., has been regularly attended to, and has occu-
pied a very large amount of time. In the course of all systematic
studies the specimens of each species regarded as duplicates have been

separated at once from the reserve series, and the material for prepar-
ing new sets for distribution to educational institutions has therefore
been gradually accumulating. Many such special sets have also been
made up and disposed of as explained elsewhere. Much of the mate-
rial in the line of marine invertebrates derived from the recent inves-
tigations of the Fish Commission has been assorted in this department,
and several of the groups which are still unassigned for study have
likewise been stored here. Progress has been made with the card or
reference catalogue corresponding with the work in the identification
of species, and so far as the collections are determined, it forms a con-
venient index to them. Collections of crustaceans borrowed from
Union College and the Peabody Museum of Yale University for pur-
poses of comparison have been returned to these institutions.

Some steps have been taken toward preparing an exhibition illus-
trating the scope of this department for the World’s Columbian Expo-
sition. These have consisted mainly in determining the family groups
represented by the known American marine invertebrates and in ascer-
taining our desiderata in that respect. No more instructive exhibit
for the use of biological students could be planned than one contain-
ing essentially all of these families, suitably displayed, and with accom-
panying descriptive labels.

The amount of cataloguing done during the year is explained in the

Mr. Benedict and Miss Rathbun have completed and published in the
proceedings of the Museum a monograph upon the genus Panopeus of
crabs, which is represented in the Museum collection by 25 species, of
which 6 were previously undescribed. The hermit crabs belonging to
the genus Hupagurus, of which 80 species are contained in our collec-
tion, have received much attention from Mr. Benedict, and a complete
report upon the group is now in course of preparation. Explorations
during the past few years, especially by the steamer Albatross in the
North Pacific Ocean, have added 37 new species to this genus, and pre-
liminary descriptions of these by Mr. Benedict have recently appeared
in the Proceedings. He has also submitted for publication a paper
upon the Corystoid crabs of the genera Telmessus and Hrimacrus, illus-
trated with three plates, and has reported upon a collection of crusta-

ceans obtained in the vicinity of Kingston, Jamaica, by Dr. T. H. Mor-
gan. The latter report was printed in one of the Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity circulars, and the specimens have been deposited in the National
Museum.

Catalogues of the Periceridxe and Maiide, families of maioid erabs,
as represented in our collection, have been completed by Miss Rathbun,
and she is at present at work upon the family Inachidze. She has also
prepared a list of the crustaceans obtained on the coast of Texas by
Prof. B. W. Evermann, during a recent fishing investigation, for pub-
lication in the Bulletin of the Fish Commission. Large numbers of
crustaceans belonging to other families than the above, principally the
result of Fish Commission explorations, but some derived from other
sources, have been identified and will be made the subject of report at
a future time.

The department is indebted to Union College, Schenectady, N. Y.,
the Buffalo Society of Natural History, and Mr. F. A. Stearns, of Detroit,
for the loan of specimens of crustaceans which were desired for exam-
ination and comparison in connection with the studies above referred
to; and also to Mr. J. E. Ives, of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural
Sciences, for assistance in comparing specimens sent from Washington
with the collections of that society. Prof. S. I. Smith, of Yale Univer-
sity, has returned to this Museum for study, the maioid crabs, the
Paguridie and Porcellanidie belonging to the earlier collections of the
Fish Commission, and some Brazilian crustaceans collected by the cura-
tor. Mr. ©. 8. Dolley has also returned the crustaceans obtained by
the steamer Albatross in the Bahama region, and sent to him for exain-
ination a few years ago.

Prot. A. E. Verrill and Miss K. J. Bush have continued enn studies
upon the Fish Commission collections, the property of the National Mu-
seum, now deposited under Prof. Verrill’s charge at the Peabody Mu-
seu of Yale University. Prof. Walter Faxon, of the Museum of Com-
parative Zoology at Harvard College, has reported upon the crayfishes
received in recent accessions, including a new species obtained in Mexico
by Prot. A. Dugés; and the specimens of Oniscidee have been sent for
examination to Profs. O. F. Cook and H. R. Jaquay, of Syracuse Univer-
sity, Syracuse, N. Y., who are proposing to monograph that family.
Prof. Edwin Linton, of Washington and Jefferson College, has described
a number of bird entozoa collected by Mr. P. L. Jouy, at Guaymas, Mex-
ico, and by himself at the Yellowstone National Park, and a paper upon
the subject has been published.

Although no regular fishery investigations were undertaken by the
U.S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross during the past year, yet inci-
dental dredgings were made during a cruise to Bering Sea with the
United States Seal Commissioners, in the summer of 1891, and during
the hydrographic survey for a cable route between California and the
Hawaiian Islands the following winter. Many interesting and several

new forms of deep-sea invertebrates were obtained in the course of both
of these expeditions, and shore collecting was also carried on at Hono-
lulu. The investigations of the steamer Fish Hawk and the schooner
Grampus on the Atlantic coast have been limited to the shallow and
surface waters, and while the natural history collections obtained by
them are not extensive, they will eventually add some material of
importance to this department.

Ten sets of duplicate marine invertebrates, belonging to series No.
IV, the composition of which has been described in previous reports,
have been distributed to educational institutions, as follows: Biolog-
ical School, Avon-by-the-sea, N. J.; Wells College, Aurora, N. Y.;
Trinity University, Durham, N. C.; Fort Worth University, Fort Worth,
Tex.; State Normal School, Mankato, Minn.; Lowa State Normal
School, Cedar Falls, Iowa; State Normal School, Whitewater, Wis.;
Mansfield Memorial Museum, Mansfield, Ohio; Leland Stanford Junior
University, Menlo Park, Cal.; Pennsylvania State Normal School, Mil-
lersville, Pa.

The following special collections have also been supplied, namely:
To the Australian Museum, Sydney, New South Wales, 73 species of
echinoderms; tothe University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada, 73 species of
echinoderms and celenterates; to Tulane University, New Orleans, La.,
15 species of corals, 27 species of echinoderms, and 23 species of erusta-
ceans; tothe Royal Zodlogical Museum, Copenhagen, Denmark, a large
series of radiates and crustaceans; to the National Deaf-Mute College,
Kendall Green, Washington, D. ©., 57 species of corals, echinoderms,
hydroids, and sponges. A number of other institutions and of individ-
uals have likewise been furnished with a few species each, generally
for purposes of special study or to supply deficiencies in their collec-
tions.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF COMPARATIVE ANATOMY
IN THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By FrREDERIC A. LUCAS, Assistant Curator.

The general work of the year has been, as heretofore, mainly in the
preparation and arrangement of osteological material, but much has
been accomplished for the department of vertebrate fossils, the work
of that department being, so far as the Museum is concerned, carried
on by the Department of Comparative Anatomy.

The most important accession of the year was the skeleton of a young
sperm whale, obtained through the courtesy of the Life-Saving Service,
from the station at Green Run Inlet, Capt. J. J. Dunton, keeper. Many
fishes have been received from the U.S. Fish Commission in connec-
tion with their work for the World’s Columbian Exposition, among
them a fine tarpon and a specimen of the opah, Lampris luna, the
latter having a special value as being the first example taken near our
coast. From the Fish Commission also came an adult bastard logger-
head turtle, Colpochelys kempi, one of the special desiderata in this
department. A second skeleton of the rare fork-tailed gull, Creagrus
Jurcatus, together with other desirable skeletons of birds, was procured
by Mr. C. H. Townsend, of the Fish Commission steamer Albatross.

In addition to the regular routine work a new catalogue of verte-
brate fossils has been commenced, and the greater part of the material
in that department has been recatalogued, a task that has entailed
much comparison of specimens with published figures, reference to
other catalogues, and some necessary identifications.

This has taken a great deal of the time of the assistant curator, as,
owing to the smallness of the force, nearly all the work, even to its
simplest details, has devolved upon him. Twenty lots of recent and
fossil bones have been reported on, and work has been continued on
the synoptic exhibition series of invertebrates, both in the preparation
of specimens and of labels. Comparatively few additions have been
made to the exhibition series, as the work of the preparators has been

181
182 “REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

mainly devoted to material for the study series, and these additions
have been chiefly skeletons of fishes, that class being at present rather
poorly represented. It may be said, however, that a number of speci-
mens were prepared for mounting, which, owing to the pressure of
other work, could not be finished. A small number of Auzoux models,
illustrating certain details of digestion and circulation, have been pur-
chased for the exhibition series, as well as some for use in connection
with the series of invertebrates.

The details of the work of the preparators are given in the report of
the osteological preparator,* and it speaks well for the skill and indus-
try of the assistants that so much has been accomplished in spite of
the many unavoidable interruptions.

The ever-increasing care of the collections has prevented any special
researches, although the assistant curator has devoted a little time to
the study of the osteology of the Steganopodes, a group of birds unusu-
ally well represented in the Museum. Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, to whom
material has been loaned, has continued his work on the osteology of
North American birds. Material has been furnished to Prof. Cope, for
his work on North American reptiles, and to the Bering Sea Commis-
sion in connection with their inquiries concerning the fur seal.

PRESENT CONDITION OF THE COLLECTION.

The present state of the collection is good, but if time admitted and
space were available, a great deal of work might be most profitably
done in labeling and arranging the study series.

The exhibition series is in good shape, but some changes are needed
in a few of the purchased specimens, and some of the labels should be
replaced by others more descriptive in their character.

The number of specimens on exhibition at the end of the year was
as follows:

of Vertebrate Fossils and the temporary withdrawal of a few others.

REPORT ON THE DEPARTMENT OF FOSSIL PLANTS
IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

By LEsTER F. WarD, Honorary Curator.

The work of the year has been in general a continuation of that out-
lined in the report for last year, the object in mind being the arrange-
ment of the specimens in such a manner as to facilitate their consultation
and study. The work of rearranging and labeling the Carboniferous
specimens was continued to some extent, but the Museum assistant,
Mr. Theo. Holm, has spent the larger part of his time in caring for the
herbarium. Many specimens have been mounted and added to the
collection, and it has in other ways been made of greater assistance in
the study of fossil plants.

During the year there have been added to the collection more exten-
sive and valuable accessions than ever before in the history of the de-
partment of fossil plants. The first of these is the immense collection
of Potomac plants turned over by the U.S. Geological Survey through
Prof. William M. Fontaine, of the University of Virginia. This collec-
tion, filling thirty-one large boxes, and representing several thousand
specimens, embraces the entire series of types and duplicates used by
Prof. Fontaine in the preparation of his elaborate Potomac or Younger
Mesozoic Flera, which forms Volume xv of the Monographs of the
U.S. Geological Survey. This flora is a very remarkable and interest-
ing one. It embraces about 365 species, of which number 75 are dico-
tyledons of peculiar and archaic types, representing perhaps the oldest
dicotyledonous flora known in the world.

Atthe same time the U.S. Geological Survey, through Prof. Fon-
taine, turned over the specimens representing the older Mesozoic flora,
which had been used by Prof. Fontaine in the preparation of Mono-
graph VI, entitled ‘‘ Contributions to the Knowledge of the Older Meso-
zoic Flora of Virginia.” This collection was contained in nine boxes,
and represented several hundred specimens. It is an exceedingly val-
nable collection, not only because it contains most of the types de-
scribed in the above work, but because it embraces many particularly
fine if not unique specimens.

185
So) REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

No gift of greater importance to the department of fossil plants has
ever been made than that by Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa., under
the terms of which his great collection of fossil plants is to be perma-
nently deposited in the National Museum. The value of this collec:
tion, one of world-wide reputation, is far greater than that of the entire
amount of the collections in the department prior to the date of its
gift. The task of procuring fossil plants from the older formations for
use in paleontological and biological research has been prosecuted for
nearly twenty years by its donor, whose liberal means and scientific
and practical mining knowledge, as well as his favorable location in the
heart of the northern anthracite coal field, have enabled him to bring
together an invaluable body of material, of which Prof. Lesquereux
remarked in one of his last publications: * “ Mr. R. D. Lacoe, of Pitts-
ton, has procured from almost all the localities where coal is worked in
the United States an immense amount of specimens, far beyond any
seen, even in the largest museums of Europe.” Since the above quota-
tion was written Mr. Lacoe has continued his work, having several col-
lectors in his employ in various States and the Acadian provinces, a
portion of the material collected having been examined by Prof. Les-
quereux. Besides gathering this material in the field, he has also pur-
chased a number of private collections containing many type speci-
mens, So that it is perhaps safe to say that nearly one-half of the types
of the American Carboniferous flora now lie within the Lacoe collee-
tion. In fact, there are few outstanding American types except those
resting in several State geological museums. But even the deficiency
in the balance of originals has largely been compensated for by the
collection of duplicates from the type localities, and these, like all other
collections made prior to 1889, were examined and labeled by the orig-
inal author of nine-tenths of the Paleozoic species described from the
United States, Leo Lesquereux. How prominent a part this material
has taken in both the biological and economie applications may be
recognized at a glance in the three volumes (especially the third) of
the “Coal Flora,” published with an atlas by the second geological
survey of Pennsylvania in 1878-1884, Report P. It is sufficient to add
in this place that within this collection the data for working out the
~ geological and geographical distribution of the Carboniferous plant
species, as far as they can be worked out at the present stage of explo-
ration, is probably more ample than that of all other American collec-
tions combined.

It will at once be seen that the accession of this invaluable wealth
of material will necessarily make this institution, as the repository of
the types or authentic specimens of nearly all the American Paleozoic
species, the reference center for all extensive work on the Paleozoic
flora in this country in future, as well as the custodian of valuable geo-
logical correlation data. But the proper installation in this Museum

of so great a collection, numbering about 100,000 specimens, is a matter
involving much embarrassment in the way of space and study facili-
ties, it being agreed in the terms of the gift that this collection, to be
kept entire and known as the “ Lacoe Coilection,” shall, together with
all future additions, either by exchange or gift of the donor, be kept in
order and made accessible to scientists and students without distine-
tion, under such proper rules and restrictions as may be necessary for
the preservation from loss or injury of the specimens.

As constituted at present the collection consists of: (1) Types and
study specimens; (2) Fine exhibition slabs and specimens; (3) Boxes
containing (a) unstudied and (b) duplicate material. The area required
by the first class, making no allowance either for the future accessions
or for new material to be found in the boxes not yet examined, amounts
to over 1,000 drawers of the size in ordinary use in the Museum. The
exhibition material will occupy about 2,100 square feet. Of the bal-
ance of the collection, about 80 boxes, a portion only will require
drawer space, while the remainder may be labeled and made in some
way accessible as exchange material.

Arrangements were made whereby, in January and February of this
year, Mr. David White, assistant paleontologist in the U.S. Geological
Survey, spent four weeks in Pittston engaged in work preliminary to
the transfer of the collection. Among the boxes brought back was a
small portion of the type and study exhibition material. Two cases of
- exhibition material have been arranged and labeled by Mr. White, and
they now stand in the central rotunda.

The remainder of the cases brought from Pittston include a large
quantity of material more or less thoroughly studied by Prof. Lesque
reux and supposed to represent species either new to science or not
before found in this country. Most of these unpublished specimens
examined by Prof. Lesquereux are accompanied by MSs. in various
stages of completion, or notes with some illustrations. All this new
matter, together with the plants in question, has been placed by Mr.
Lacoe in the hands of Mr. White, who will assist him in revising, veri-
fying, and completing the posthumous work for publication. Mueh
time and labor will be necessary in the preparation of the Ms. and
additional drawings for the publication, which should appear as soon
as possible, before this portion of the collection is ready for enrollment
on the Museum register. Owing largely to failing health during the
last years of Prof. Lesquereux’s scientific labors a considerable time
wili need to be spent in going through the collection in a scrutinous
review. This task, along with the identification of a large quantity of
lew material, probably requiring five or six months, it is the donor’s
desire to have accomplished before the entire collection is removed
and enrolled on the Museum books. It can probably be best done in
Pittston, where Mr. Lacoe will be at hand to furnish any needed geo-
graphical or stratigraphieal information.
188 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1892.

In the removal of so enormous a collection it will perhaps be better
to transfer it by orders or groups as fast as the necessary scrutiny and
completion of labels and enrollment are finished. It is therefore de-
sirable that, whenever the work is renewed, cases may be ready for its
reception as fast as the material arrives in Washington.

The separation of the duplicate specimens for exchange will be simul-
taneous with the review and registry of the specimens. ‘These should
be labeled and fully listed before placing them in an accessible storage.
Several exchanges have already been engaged with American and
European paleontologists, the specimens for which may be selected
while the collection is being packed.

In acquiring the Lacoe collection the Museum not only receives a most
important paleontological accession, but it becomes the custodian of a
large mass of unelaborated correlative material, which, if rightly used,
will prove of great value and aid to scientific and economic geology; and
this rich possession affords just ground for national scientific pride,
while the liberal public spirit with which it was given is worthy of
imitation by all patrons of science.

My investigations of the local exposures of the Potomac formation,
as mentioned in my last report, were continued as opportunity afforded
throughout the year. In September and October I made, in company
with several members of the U. 8S. Geological Survey, an extended
field trip to Texas and Arkansas with a view of determining the prob-
able relation of the Trinity formation of those States with the Potomac
formation. In April I also made another field trip, this time studying
the Lower Cretaceous formations of Alabama, securing a valuable col-
lection of fossil plants. Later,in May and June, I made an extensive
overland journey from the Potomac to the Raritan in New Jersey for
the purpose of studying the relation of the Potomac of Virginia and
Maryland and the so-called “‘Amboy clays” of New Jersey. The results
were in every way sasisfactory and will be published by the U. 8.
Geological Survey.

Mr. Theo. Holm was the Museum assistant for the entire year. His
time was mainly spent in work on the herbarium, with a view to making
it of the greatest possible value in the study of fossil plants. He
mounted and placed in the cases several hundred sheets of plants,
largely native trees and shrubs, and at the close of the year was
engaged upon the duplicate collection in selecting such as it seemed
desirable to mount for the study series. He had also begun the deter-
mination of a collection of plants from Morocco, obtained during 1889
by Mr. Talcott Williams, of Philadelphia.

Prof. F. H. Knowlton continued during the year his study of the
Laramie flora, and had well under way at the close a revision of the
plants of this group, based on the original Lesquereux type specimens
in the National Museum and large recent collections from Colorado.
When this work is completed, it is hoped that the Laramie flora will be

placed on a basis that will admit of its extensive geological use. Prof.
Knowlton also identified and revised, by the aid of Museum material,
a considerable collection of plants from the Bozeman (Montana) coal
field and prepared a report which will soon be printed. It enumerates
forty-four species, five of which are described as new to science.

The accessions of Upper Paleozoic material, with the exception of the
fossil woods, have been examined by Mr. David White, who has reported
on all minor transmittals. In connection with his regular survey work
Mr. White has also spent a considerable time on the collections sent by
Dr. J. H. Britts from the Power coal measures of Missouri, and the first
collection forwarded by L. Graff from Van Buren, Ark., the speci-
mens being studied by genera, together with those of the Carboniferous
plant collections of the U.S. Geological Survey now in his hands. The
work on the Britts collections, which include a number of new or little
known forms, will probably be completed by the 1st of January. His
study and other work on the Lacoe collection is mentioned in the part
of this report relating to that particular collection.
