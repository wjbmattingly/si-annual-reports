XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

The following letter was read :

PRINCE1ON, N. J., January 9, 1886.
To the Chancellor and Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

GENTLEMEN: The undersigned, having been for seventeen years a
member of the Executive Committee, most respectfully requests of you
the favor to be released from further service on this committee.

He makes-this.request with the less reluctance, as he is confident
that his place upon the committee can be readily supplied.

With the highest respect, yours,
JOHN MACLEAN.

Committee be accepted, and that General Montgomery C. Meigs be

On motion of Dr. Gray, it was—

Resolved, That Dr. James C. Welling be, and he hereby is, appointed

Dr. Welling presented the report of the Executive Committee for the
six months ending 30th June, 1885, which was read.

{n motion of Dr. Gray, it was—

Resolved, That the report of the Executive Committee be accepted.

The Secretary presented his report of the operations and condition
of the Institution for the six months ending 30th June, 1885, which, in
accordance with the instructions of the Board at its last meeting, had
been printed and distributed to the Regents.

fiscal year terminating on the 30th of June of each year, and that while
it had carefully examined all the accounts of the Institution to the be-
ginning of the year 1886 and had verified the statement exhibited by
the Secretary, it was not considered that a further report was called for
at the present time.

The following letter was read:

WASHINGTON, D. C., September 1, 1885.
Prof. SPENCER F. BArrp,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution:

DEAR Sir: Lam desirous of placing at least a portion of my prop-
erty, essentially all which is an inheritance from my father, in a posi-
tion in which it may be of permanent service for the advancement of
knowledge. I have always devoted so much of it as I did not need for
my maintenance and education to that purpose. It occurs to me that if
JOURNAL -OF PROCEEDINGS. XIII

I could make an arrangement with the Smithsonian Institution by which
I might not sacrifice my own needs while living and my duty to my wife
or to my children (if 1 should have any), after my death, I might ac-
complish the end which I desire. I throw out the following as a sketch
of what I think might be feasible: As the Institution receives, and I sup-
pose will always receive, 6 per cent. for its investments with the Govern-
_ ment, I might transfer to it a sum of money for which I should receive
an income of say 5 per cent. during my life and the life of my wife, or
until my children (if I had any) arrived at an age such that they might
_ provide for themselves. The other 1 per cent. would accrue to the
Institution in the mean time, and the whole eventually, as compensa-
tion for the making of this arrangement. Whether that should be
devoted to a specific object or to the general purposes of the Institution
might be a matter for further consideration.
Respectfully,

B. PICKMAN MANN.

The Chancellor and several of the Regents having expressed their
opinion that such a proposition could not be accepted by the Institu-
tion, on motion of Mr. Wilson the communication was referred to the
Executive Committee.

The Secretary presented a statement relative to the bequest of the
late Rev. Alex. G. Mercer, of Newport, R. I.

This gentleman died on the 3d November, 1882, and left property to
the amount of about a million dollars. After the decease of certain
beneficiaries the property is to be divided into three parts, of which

one part is to be administered by a board consisting of the President
of Harvard University, the President of Yale College, and the Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution, together with three other individ-
tals mentioned in the will, or their survivors, “to establish scholarships
or foundations in such colleges as they may select, for the benefit of
such poor students as have passed through some of the public schools
with the best reputation for character and ability.”

The Chancellor presented a letter from the family of the late Pro-
fessor Henry relative to the publication of his scientific writings.

On motion of Dr. Porter, the communication was referred to Dr. Gray
and the Executive Committee.

Dr. Gray called attention to the fact that provision had not yet been
made for the estimates and appropriations for the ensuing year.

On motion of Dr. Welling, it was—

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the six months end-
ing 30th June, 1886, and for the twelve months ending 30th June, 1887,

be expended by the Secretary, with full discretion as to the items, sub-
ject to the approval of the Executive Committee.

On motion, the Board adjourned sine die.

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE. XVII

An appropriation of $40,000 was made by Congress for the fiscal year
ending 30th June, 1886, for the prosecution of ethnological researches
under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
The actual conduct of these investigations has been placed by the Sec-
retary in the hands of Maj. J. W. Powell, Director of the Geological
Survey. The abstracts of expenditures and balance sheets have been
exhibited to us; the vouchers for the expenditures are, however, trans-
mnitted, after approval by Professor Baird, to the accounting officers of
the Treasury Department for settlement.

The balance available to meet outstanding liabilities on the 1st of
July, 1886, as reported by the official disbursing agent, is $869.13.

XVIII REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

The committee has examined the vouchers for payments made from
the Smithson income during the year ending 30th June, 1886, all of
which bear the approval of the Secretary of the Institution, and a cer-
tificate that the materials and services charged were applied to the pur-
poses of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the National Mu-
seum, and find that the balances above given correspond with the cer-
tificates of the disbursing officers of the Interior and Treasury Depart-
ments.

The quarterly accounts-current, the vouchers, and journals have been
examined and found correct.

Respectfully submitted.

WASHINGLON, December 3, 1886,
REPORT OF PROFESSOR BAIRD,

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION :

For the year ending June 30, 1886.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution :

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to present herewith the report of the
operations and condition of the Smithsonian Institution for the year
188586. In accordance with the resolutions adopted by the Board at
its meeting held January 21, 1885, that the fiscal year of the Institution
shall hereafter terminate on the 30th day of June in each year, and the
annual report of the Secretary shall hereafter be prepared, printed,
and sent to each member of the Board on or before the Ist day of De-
cember in each year, the present report covers the period from July 1,
1885, to the close of June, 1886.

As heretofore, this report includes, in addition to the account of the
operations of the Institution itself, a summary of the work performed
by the branches of the public service placed by Congress under its
charge, namely, the National Museum and the Bureau of Ethnology.
To this will be added a sketch of the work of the United States Fish
Commission, which is also under my charge, and of that of the United
States Geological Survey (kindly furnished by its Director), which, al-
though entirely independent of the Smithsonian Institution, is yet in
close relation with it by reason of its field of exploration, and especially
through the valuable accessions of material furnished by it to the Na-
tional Museum.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
INTRODUCTORY.

No event of special importance has occurred during the year, the

_usual operations of the Institution having been steadily carried on, but

with a marked increase in routine work. The system of international
exchanges formerly conducted with only two assistants has lately re-
quired the constant labor of nine and at times of several more em-
ployés. The correspondence which at one time was carried on by the
i

2% REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Secretary and one clerk now occupies a great part of the time of five
persons. The accounts in like manner have gradually demanded more
attention, as have all the other departments of work.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

Senator George I’. Edmunds having ceased to be President pro tem-
pore of the United States Senate, Hon. John Sherman was elected on the
7th December, 1885, to that office, and in accordance with the precedents
established, was placed on the list of Regents as Acting Vice-Presi-
dent.

On the 26th of December, 1885, a joint resolution of Congress was ap-
proved by the President of the United States re-electing as Regents for
six years, Dr. John Maclean, of Princeton, N. J., Dr. Asa Gray, of Cam-
bridge, Mass., and Dr. Henry Coppée, of Bethlehem, Pa. The same
resolution elected General Montgomery C. Meigs, of Washington, D.
C.,in place of General William T. Sherman, whose term had expired, and
who was no longer eligible as a Regent from Washington on account of
his change of residence to Saint Louis, Mo.

The vacancy in the Executive Committee, occasioned by the expira-
tion of General Sherman’s term, was filled by resolution of the Regents
on the 13th of January, 1886, by the election of Dr. H. Coppée; and
Dr. Maclean having resigned from his place on the committee, the Re-
gents at the same meeting elected General Meigs to fill the vacancy.

Dr. James C. Welling was made chairman of the Executive Com-
mittee.

On the 12th of January, 1886, the Speaker of the House, Hon. J. G.
Carlisle, re-appointed as Regents, Hon. Otho R. Singleton, of Mississippi,
Hon. William L. Wilson, of West Virginia, and Hon. William Walter
Phelps, of New Jersey.

Portraits of the Regents —Kfforts have been made during the year to
complete the collection of likenesses of all who have served as its Re-
gents, and there have been added to the collection a crayon portrait of
Prof. Alex. D. Bache, by H. Ulke, a fine lithograph of Hon. John W.
Maury, formerly mayor of the city of Washington, and a photograph of
Hon. Walter Lenox, also mayor of Washington.

We still desire likenesses of the following Regents: ;

Hon. G. E. Badger, of North Carolina, 1856-1863; Hon. R. M. Charl
ton, of Georgia, 1852-1853; Hon. W. F. Colcock, of Georgia, 1850-1853 ;
Hon. Shelby M. Cullom, of Illinois, 1885-1886; Hen. D. Davis, of Ili-
nois, 1881-1883; Hon. Garret Davis, of Kentucky, 1863-1872; Hon.
Henry W. Davis, of Maryland, 1863-1865; Hon. Gideon Hawley, of -
New York, 1846-1855; Hon. William I. Hough, of New York, 1846-
1847; Hon. George P. Marsh, of Vermont, 1847-1849; Hon. Benjamin

FINANCES.

There is no change to be reported in the financial condition of the
Institution. The fund remains the same, viz, $703,000, permanently
deposited in the Treasury of the United States according to the acts
of Congress of August 10, 1846, and February 8, 1867.

The receipts and expenditures for the year ending 30th June, 1886,
are as follows:

This balance will be required for the current operations of the Insti-
tution for the ensuing six months.

The necessity for compliance with the usual requirements of Govern-
ment service does not exist in the operations of the Institution, for the
accounts are audited only by its executive committee and all expenditures
are controlled by the Secretary. It has been deemed proper, however,
to throw all the safeguards possible around the financial operations, so
that anything like defaleation or peculation should be rendered impos-
sible.

The appropriations made by Congress for the Museum, international
exchanges, &c., in charge of the Smithsonian Institution have been

disbursed as usual by officers of the Interior and Treasury Depart-

ments, the vouchers receiving examination and approval of the proper
Auditor and Comptroller. <A full account of the expenditures of the
Insfitution'is given in the report of the Executive Committee. °

BUILDINGS.

There is not much to say in regard to the subject of the buildings in
charge of the Smithsonian Institution. No material alterations have
taken place in the series, consisting of the Smithsonian central build-
ing, the National Museum building, the Armory building, the Labor-
atory building, and the Annex building. The last-mentioned edifice
was constructed for the purpose of making up the exhibit for the New
Orleans Exposition, and has been necessarily continued in use in the
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

lack of other accommodations for the offices housed therein; especially
that of the chief taxidermist and his assistants; the chief osteologist
and his assistant; and other persons connected with the work of pre-
paring and mounting specimens; and the preparators of the Ethnolog-
ical Bureau charged with the reproduction of miniature models of the
various Pueblo villages in Arizona and New Mexico. This building is
also used for the storage of vast numbers of collections, including hun-
dreds of tons of fossils collected by the United States Geological Sur-
vey.

The erection of a building for the accommodation of the Library, Mu-
seum, and Records of the Medical Department of the Army, renders it
very desirable that provision should be made elsewhere for the service
of this Annex building, as it is extremely combustible, and should it
take fire, with the wind blowing from the westward, the flames would
actually come in contact with the Army Medical Museum, and could not
fail to penetrate the windows and doors, with great danger to its con-
tents. Unfortunately such is the present crowded condition of all our
receptacles, that it is impossible to find quarters elsewhere, either for
the offices mentioned or for the collections.

Some years ago, the Board of Regents authorized the application to
Congress for an appropriation for the construction of a second Mu-
seum building, to be placed on the west side of the Smithsonian reserv-
ation, and to correspond with the present building on the east side-
the object being to accommodate, in part at least, the enormous accu-
mulations of valuable material partly acquired at the Centennial, and
in part obtained at the New Orleans Exposition, and under other cir-
cumstances. A new building equal in size to the present one would
scarcely furnish the accommodations needed; and, as the Government
collections are increasing year by year, by donations of foreign govern-
ments, &c., it is difficult to express with sufficient force the necessity
for additional quarters.

The National Museum building was erected within the original esti-
mate, at a cost of $250,000. It would be impossible at the present time
to duplicate this building at that figure, and as special provision is de-
sired for laboratories and offices, and to give suitable quarters to the
U.S. Geological Survey and Ethnological Bureau, an estimate has been
made of the sum of $250,000 for the purpose of constructing one wing
and pavilion to accommodate the collections, leaving the remainder to
be constructed hereafter, should Congress so approve it, at a cost of,
perhaps, an additional $250,000.

An estimate has been presented to Congress for several years, with-
out receiving any attention, for the construction of a fire-proof build-
ing for the accommodation of the alcoholic collections of fishes, rep-
tiles, &c., belonging to the National Museum.

Within a few years past the principal museums of Europe have been
putting up such buildings, in view of the danger of destruction, not
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

only of the specimens themselves, but of the other collections, should
fire break out among them. The new Museum building can, however,
be so arranged as to furnish such accommodations and not involve any
general danger.

In this same connection it may be proper to state that strenuous
efforts are now being made, and with apparent prospect of success,
looking towards an exposition in 1892—the four hundredth anniver-
sary of the discovery of America by Columbus—of a complete illus-
tration of the New World at that date, and of its progress in the arts

- and industries in the four hundred years intervening. The collections

of the National Museum for the most part tend towards such a dis-
play, and if the new building in question were at our command it
would be a very easy matter to organize and arrange it with this ob-
ject in view, without unnecessary labor or great expense, and by the
date mentioned, as the result of the current work of the Museum,
without any spasmodic or unusual effort.

EXPLORATIONS.

There is not so much to record in the way of explorations for the
year 1886 as has been the case in some previous years, due mainly to
the fact of the completion of work in many of the districts, and of
the lack of sufficient means to inaugurate new enterprises of any
magnitude. The closing and withdrawal from the outposts in Alaska
and elsewhere of the U.S. Signal Service stations, have also cut off
a large field of labor, many of the most important explorations hav-
ing been conducted by the Smithsonian Institution in co-operation
with that establishment. Confining itself, as it has done in the main,
to North America as a field of research, the unknown portion, of
course, has in the nearly forty years of effort on the part of the Insti-
tution become greatly reduced. It is quite safe to say that to no es-
tablishment or agency is the knowledge of the geography, ethnology,
natural history, &c., of the continent more due than to the labors of
the Smithsonian Institution.

Congress having directed the preparation and submission to it an-
nually of a separate and special report on the National Museum, a full
statement of the agencies of explorations and exchange by which ac-
cessions have been made will be found in the report of Mr. G. Brown
Goode, the assistant director, and therefore a briefer mention than
usual will be sufficient for the present occasion.

Arctic America.—The last collections made by Mr. L. M. Turner, of
the U.S. Signal Office, at Ungava Bay, in Northern Labrador, have
been received, and he is now busily occupied in preparing his report on
the region visited. It is safe to say that we owe more to Mr. Turner for
our knowledge of Northern Labrador than to any other explorer or
naturalist, and the results of his labor will be found +o be of the high-

est interest. Not content simply with making collections of natural
history, he has devoted much time to the study of the language and
manners of the people, and his vocabularies and philological records
are of the utmost possible interest and importance.

Alaska.—One of the most productive explorations of Alaska for some
time past was that by Mr. Charles H. Townsend, sent out by the U. 8.
Fish Commission to make some investigations into the fur-seal fish-
eries on the Pribyloff Islands, where he arrived in June, 1885. While
there he accepted an invitation from Captain Healy, commander of the
U.S. revenue steamer Corwin, to accompany that vessel on its more
northern voyage, by way of Saint Michael’s and other points, and
through Bering’s Strait, finally entering Hotham Inlet in July.
Here the steamer remained, while the steam launch, commanded by
Lieutenant Cantwell and accompanied by Mr. Townsend, went on to
the mouth of the Kowak and up the river to the head of navigation, a
distance of about 350 miles. Abundance of pine fuel was found all
along the route with which to supply the boilers of the launch.

A large collection of fishes, birds, mammals, and plants, with inter-
esting objects of ethnology, was secured on this occasion. Mr. Town-
send states that Lieutenant Cantwell found the source of the Kowak
in a large lake among the mountains, nearly 450 miles from the sea—
a lake swarming with lake trout of the same species as that in the
northern parts of the United States and Canada. To the surprise of
all, the region was found to be well wooded, and abounding in many
kinds of fur-bearing animals. About eighteen species of fish were
secured.

The Corwin was rejoined at Kotzebue Sound on September 1.

Mr. Townsend’s full report was transmitted to Captain Healy, to ac.
company his report to the Secretary of the Treasury, of the cruise of
the Corwin.

By authority of the Treasury Department, and with the kind co-
operation of the Alaska Commercial Company, ever ready to be ex-
tended in the interest of science, Mr. Townsend obtained five complete
sets of the fur seals, in all stages of sex and age.

Captain Healy has continued, on his own account, the record of pre-
vious years, by devoting such time as could conveniently be expended
in his northward cruises, to the gathering of collections of fishes, &c.,
for the National Museum, all of which have come duly to hand.

Mr. Henry D. Woolfe, in the employ of the Pacific Steam Whaling
Company, has utilized his residence at Cape Lisburne, in gathering col-
jections in ethnography and natural history, and has transmitted some
very acceptable contributions which have been received, leaving others
yet to come to hand.

Mr. J. W. Johnson, United States signal observer at Nushagak, on
Bristol Bay, in continuation of the highly valued labors of Mr. C. L.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7

McKay, has supplied much that was desirable in the way of bird-
skins, Eskimo clothing, stone relies, &c. By the withdrawal of most of
the signal stations from Alaska, Mr. Johnson has been transferred to
Port Huron, Mich., although it is expected that contributions will still
be received from the station through the kind assistance of Mr. Clark,
the resident officer of the Alaska Commercial Company.

Mr. Grebnitsky, in charge of the Commander Islands off the coast of
Kamchatka, whose kind assistance to Dr. Stejneger, during his stay
in that region has been gratefully acknowledged, has continued to
make quite extended transmissions of collections, including skeletons
of mammals, alcoholic preparations of mammals, birds, crustaceans,
&c., which are very much valued.

From Capt. H. Ei. Nichols, commander of the U.S. 8. Pinta, and Dr.
T. H. Streets, surgeon of the same vessel, stationed at Sitka, many im-
portant collections in nataral history have come to hand, while from
Lieut. T. Dix Bolles, of the same service, have been received a number
of ethnological objects of much interest.

Washington Territory.—Mr.-. James G. Swan, the veteran correspond-
ent of the Smithsonian Institution at Puget Sound, has continued his
investigations and contributions through the year, the latter including
numbers of articles prepared and used by the Indians for domestic
purposes.

Rocky Mountain Region.—A large collection of skins and eggs of birds
was received from Capt. Charles Bendire.

_As explained elsewhere, this gentleman has been retired from actual
service inthe Army, after the proper term of service, at his own request,
and is now devoting himself as voluntary curator of odlogy to the
building up and thorough organization of the collection of nests and
eggs of birds, after presenting to the Museum his own magnificent cabi-
net, perhaps the largest in the United States. He has the aid of all

his correspondents towards completing the series, as also that of Dr. J.

C. Merrill, who has likewise presented his entire cabinet of eggs.

Montana.—The attention of the Smithsonian Institution has been
called very impressively to the impending extinction of the buffalo, and.
to the fact that the localities which, a few years ago, abounded in these
animals are now almost without them. Indeed, the reduction in num-
ber has been so rapid as to render it probable that it is a question of
months rather than of years before they become extinct.

Realizing the fact that neither the National Museum nor the other
museums of the country possess well-prepared specimens of the buffalo,

‘and, desirous of securing a series before it is too late, the Institution

determined to send its chief taxidermist, Mr. William T. Hornaday,
with a party of assistants, to localities where the buffalo were still sup-
posed to occur in small numbers, with the view of securing enough for

the purposes in question.
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

By the courteous aid of the Secretary of War and of the Adjutant-
General, instructions were given to the commanders of military posts at
Fort Keogh and Fort Maginnis, Mont., and Fort McKinney, Wyo., to
render Mr. Hornaday all the aid in their power towards his laudable
object; and the expedition left in June for the field of operations.
Although a number of skeletons and skulls were found on the plains,
it was with great difficulty that one buffalo bull was killed; this proving
to be in a condition scarcely fit for mounting, the party reluctantly
returned to Washington with the intention of starting again in the
autumn when the chances would be somewhat better.

A number of good skins of antelopes, mammals, and birds were ob-
tained by the party.

California.—A considerable amount of work has been done in Oali-
fornia, especially by Lieut. P. H. Ray, U. S. Army, formerly in charge
of the Point Barrow expedition. This officer, with a thorough knowl-
edge of what is desired, made an extremely valuable collection, illus-
trating the manners and customs of the Hoopa Indians, of whom he had
charge, and bis contribution is one of the most interesting yet made to-
the galleries of the National Museum.

A somewhat similar collection, though not so extensive, was made by
Mr. Loren W. Green, of the fish-hatching station at Baird, Cal. This
includes especially a number of Indian bows and arrows, &c., with the
apparatus used in constructing them, including a full set of implements
for making stone arrow points.

Mr. Townsend, whose explorations in Alaska have been referred to,
also made extensive explorations on the coast of California, especially
at Humboldt Bay, in the northern part of the State. He obtained val-
uable statistics in regard to the fisheries of that region, and made many
important collections for the National Museum. He then proceeded
south ward to the whaling stations along the southern coast of the State,
with special reference to the California gray-whale fisheries. He found
that so far from approaching extermination this species is re-establish-
ing itself, and is becoming quite abundant in the lagoons of Lower Cal-
ifornia.

Arizona.—A large collection in ethnology was made by Dr. Palmer
in this Territory'in continuation of previous operations.

Extensive collections in.addition to former gatherings were made,
partly in Arizona and partly in New Mexico, by Mr. E. W. Nelson.
These including very fine pottery of a somewhat novel type obtained
from the graves, as also a number of interesting specimens of mammals,
birds, &c.

New Mexico.—Very interesting contributions in zoology, &c., have
been received from Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, since his detail as medical officer
at Fort Wingate; his labors as a collector being supplemented by his
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

thorough accomplishment as a naturalist and investigator. The result
has been to furnish to the Institution much information of great inter-
est in connection with the region in question.

The researches of the Ethnological Bureau conducted in the region
of Arizona and New Mexico, have been made principally by Col. James
Stevenson and the Messrs. Mendeleff, full reference to which will be
found in the accompanying report of the Director of the Bureau of
Ethnology. The explorations of the mounds throughout the country
have been carried on under the direction of Prof. Thomas.

Mr. E. W. Nelson has also contributed many interesting specimens,
both of zoology and of ethnology, gathered.in New Mexico.

From Mr. Thomas Keam, of Keam’s Cafion, a very hearty co-worker
of the Ethnological Bureau and of the U. 8S. Geological Survey, large
collections have been received on deposit, which add materially to the
value of the present ethnological display.

No explorations of any special magnitude have been made in the older
parts of the United States, with the exception of what has been prose-
_cuted in the line of geology and palxontology by the U.S. Geological
Survey. Many thousands, however, of specimens have been gathered
by the Survey in Florida, Alabama, Texas, and elsewhere, which will
be dwelt upon hereafter.

Atlantic coast of the United States—As in previous years, the U.S.
Fish Commission has been the principal contributor from this part of
the coast and the adjacent high seas, and the continued researches of
the steamers Albatross and Fish Hawk are noteworthy in their results.

The completion of the schooner Grampus, for the service of the U.S.
Fish Commission, will doubtless add to the yield, especially as this
vessel is well fitted for making collections of all kinds. It did not,
however, get fairly into commission until about July 1.

Mexico and Central America.—For a number of years past the Insti-
tution has had a much valued correspondence with Prof. A. Dugés, an
eminent Mexican naturalist, resident at Guanajuato, and especially in-
terested in determining accurately the animals and plants of his neigh-
borhood. This gentleman has, for a long time, sent to the Institution
all the specimens that he has been unable to identify, with permission
to the Institution to retain the greater part of them, and this has re-
sulted in adding to the cabinet many specimens of great rarity.

From Governor A. R. Shepherd, of Batopilas, collections of minerals
have been received; also from Mr. M. E. Wilkinson, specimens in alco-
hol of mammals, reptiles, and fishes.

Some ancient pottery has been supplied by Rev. David A. Watkins,
of Guadalajara.

George I’. Gaumer, formerly United States consul to Yucatan, now
engaged in special explorations in that and adjacent regions, has con-
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tributed quite a number of species of birds, many of them new to the
Institution.

Seattering collections have come to hand from various points in Cen-
tral America and the West Indies, the most important of the latter
being the collection of fishes made by the Natural History Museum of
Kingston, Jamaica, and sent for the purpose of identification, which
work was promptly done.

Mr. L. Guesde, of Guadaloupe, has furnished some specimens of birds
for identification, and has also contributed a number of stone imple-
ments of Carib origin.

Prof. F. Poey has continued his contributions of Cuban fishes in alco-
hol; thus adding to the very extensive donations already made by him,
principally of types of his published species.

A large ethnological collection made by Dr. Edward Palmer, in the
vicinity of Guadalajara, is especially valuable as containing illustra-
tions of the entire series of the processes of making the celebrated
earthenware of that district.

A series of contributions relating to the natural history, ethnology,
and archeology of Costa Rica, begun many years ago by Mr. José C.
Zeledon, and continued year by year, has been sent us in 1886, and in-
cludes many rare and new species of birds. The Institution has seldom
had a correspondent and collaborator of longer continuance in his re-
lationships, nor any one furnishing objects of greater value; and it is to
him—a pupil of the late Dr. von Frantzius—that we owe the greater
part of our knowledge of the natural history of that most interesting of
countries.

During the winter the U. I’. Fish Commission steamer Albatross was
engaged in prosecuting hydrographic researches at the request of the
Navy Department, and incidentally devoted such time as could be
spared to the investigation of the natural history of the Bahaman
region. Many islands were visited, and their land fauna investigated ;
while the marine objects were also secured by means of the dredge and
trawl. Asa result, there have been several new species of birds added
to our knowledge, and many rare fishes collected. Of marine inverte-
brates, &c., large gatherings have been secured.

Asia.—The Institution has been very fortunate in having, in Japan
and Corea, gentlemen interested in the U.S. National Museum, and,
officially, or otherwise, able to make explorations and collections in _
natural history and ethnology; and to no one isit more indebted in this
connection than to Mr. P. L. Jouy, formerly an employé of the National
Museum. This gentleman has been for some time in the civil service of
the Corean Government, and has made-large gatherings, none of which
have, as yet, come to hand. The collections actually received are nine
boxes, obtained by Ensign J. B. Bernadou, U. 8S. Navy, mainly in
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ll

Corea; including large numbers of ethnological objects and specimens
in alcohol almost entirely new to the Museum.

A very important collection illustrating the life history of the Ja-
panese has been received from the department of education of Japan,
and is suitably displayed in one of the main halls of the Museum, where
it fills a case of about 60 feet in length, and attracts much interest.

The Japanese series is rapidly acquiring a distinguished pre-eminence,
and every year becomes more and more complete.

PUBLICATIONS.

Of the different classes of works issued by the Institution, the first
place is naturally assigned to the quarto ‘‘ Contributions to Knowledge.”

Second in order are the octavo “Miscellaneous Collections,” which,
by reason of their various sources, form the most voluminous series
The classes of productions going to swell the same may be specified as
follows: Ist, the numerous collections of physical, statistical, chemical,
biological, anal ethnological researches pr accu directly by the mia
tation itself or under its immediate auspices; 2d, the occasional ‘‘ Toner
Lectures,” delivered under the encouragement of the fund established
by Dr. Joseph Toner, but published by this Institution ; 3d, the special
annual reports on the latest advances in the leading departments of
science, maintained at the expense of the Institution, though first given

_ to the public through the medium of the official annual reports of the

Regents. These are all issued separately in pamphlet form; and proba-
bly will ultimately be collected in volumes, each devoted to its partie-
ular subject; 4th, the “proceedings” of various societies for the ad-
vancement of science, stereotyped and published by the Institution ;
including at present the Bulletins of the Philosophical Society of
Washington, the Transactions of the Anthropological Society of Wash-
ington, and the Proceedings of the Biological Society of Washington ;
5th, the Bulletins, Proceedings, Circulars, and Instructions of the U.S.
National Museum, published primarily under the direction of the hon-
orable Secretary of the Interior, but re-issued by the Institution.

The third series comprises the annual reports of the Regents of the
Institution to Congress, in octavo volumes.

The fourth series comprises the publications of the Bureau of Ethnol-
ogy, under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution. This is issued
in larger or imperial octavo volumes. :

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.—A work entitled ‘ Re-
searches upon the venoms of Poisonous Serpents,” by S. Weir Mitchell,
M. D., and Edward T. Reichert, M. D., has been printed during the past
year, and will soon be \ready for distribution. This is a continuation
of the investigations on this important subject undertaken by Dr. Mitch-
ell some twenty-five years ago, and published by the Institution, in
the same series, at the beginning of the year 1861. The present supple-
re REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

mentary memoir by the joint authors embraces an examination into the
physical and chemical characteristics of the venoms of various rattle-
snakes (Crotalidw), of the moccasin (Ancistrodon), and also of the
hooded viper (Cobra), of India; the re-actions of various agents on the
venom, the physiological effects of the venoms on serous surfaces, on
the nervous system, on the circulation, on respiration, &c., and the
general pathology of the subject. In an appendix of 21 pages is given
a very full bibliography of the literature of the subject, brought down
to date. The work forms a quarto volume of x + 186 pages, illustrated
by 4 figures or wood cuts in the text, and 5 chromolithographic plates.

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.—Of this series there are already
on hand published articles sufficient to form a number of volumes; al-
though such formal collection and issue of numbered volumes has been
unavoidably postponed by other pressing requirements, fully employ-
ing the available funds of the Institution. The new publications in
this series during the past year have been as follows:

512. “List of Institutions in the United States receiving publications
of the Smithsonian Institution.” This list comprises the titles of 1,838
domestic institutions, not including a considerable number of libraries
and individuals receiving various special publications irregularly. The
catalogue forms an octavo pamphlet of 72 pages.

o14, “A Catalogue of Scientific and Technical Periodicals (1665 to
1882), together with Chronological Tables, and a Check-List.” By
Henry Carrington Bolton. As stated by the compiler, in his preface.
“This catalogue is intended to contain the principal periodieals of every
branch of pure and applied science, published in all countries, from the
rise of this literature to the close of the year 1882.” What are known
as professional journals (those relating specially to theology, law, and
medicine), as well as those relating to music and the fine arts, have
been omitted. ‘‘ While medicine has been excluded, anatomy, physi-
ology, and veterinary science, being related to zoology, have been ad-
mitted. With a few exceptions, serials published by learned societies
have been omitted; those admitted either form part of a series begun
or ending in an independent periodical, or are presumably not exclu.
sively devoted to the proceedings of the societies by which they are
edited. The admission of society publications to this catalogue would
swell the volume to an inconvenient size; and has been rendered unnec.
essary by the publication of the ‘Catalogue of Scientific Serials,’ by Mr.
S. H. Scudder.” This very complete list of the periodicals indicated,
numbering over 5,000 titles, is arranged alphabetically, and extends to
615 pages.

The catalogue is followed by 91 pages of “Chronological Tables,” in
smaller type, arranged in columns by years, giving a synchronal con-
spectus of all those periodicals having any considerable number of vol-
umes, and showing the precise number of the volume published in any
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

given year. ‘This definite correlation of date and volume is ofttimes a
matter of some importance to those not having access to the volumes
themselves. To this succeeds a concise index of subjects (under 94
heads, alphabetically arranged), citing the classified periodicals simply
by their number in the general catalogue.

The volume concludes with a “ Library Check-List,” of 54 pages, in
which, following the number belonging to a periodical, is given the
library or libraries where such periodical may be found; each of the
127 principal libraries of the United States and Canada being desig-
nated by a symbolic abbreviation. In many cases the number indicat-
ing a given periodical is followed by but a single reference. This di-
rectory to the locality, where possibly arare journal may be consulted,
is a valuable feature of the catalogue, and efforts will be made to add
to its fullness and accuracy in future editions. The whole work forms an
octavo volume of x + 773 pages, and is one highly creditable to the
zeal and industry of its author; who, though assisted by such facilities
and means of communication as were within the reach of.the Institu-
tion, devoted to its compilation his leisure for many years, without
any remuneration, excepting his consciousness of performing a useful
labor.

550. “The Scientific Writings of Joseph Henry.” This important
work is now entirely stereotyped, and will be put to press as soon as
conveniently may be. The size of the collection (exceeding 1,000 pages)
has required its division into two volumes. Volume I, comprising 68
papers and abstracts, chronologically arranged, contains 535 pages, in-
cluding introductory note and index, and is illustrated by 46 wood-cut
figures. Volume II, comprising 25 papers and abstracts, contains 559
pages, including index, and is illustrated by 48 wood-cut figures.
In order not to separate Professor Henry’s Meteorological Essays,
published successively through a period of five years (1855-1859), and
extending to 400 pages, it was judged expedient to so far interrupt the
chronological order otherwise maintained, as to carry the entire series
over to the second volume. And in like manner it became necessary,
in order to secure a comparative equalization in the sizes of the two
volumes, to transfer the connected series of researches on sound in re-
lation to fog-signaling (published during the four years 1874-1877) back
from their natural place to the end of the first volume. Although this
dislocation of the natural or historical order is in some respects to be
regretted, it yet enables the reader to have a more connected view of
the longer series of papers, without the inconvenience of alternate refer-
ence to different volumes.

It is designed to have printed two editions of the work; one in royal
octavo size, to correspond with the ‘‘ Memorial Volume” issued by order
of Congress; and the other in ordinary octavo size, to correspond with
the “ Miscellaneous Collections.”

627. “ Price-List of Publications of the Smithsonian Institution.”
This list includes ouly those publications on hand, down to July, 1885,
which can be furnished to applicants, and gives the price at which each
is held. Many of the earlier publications being out of print, these
have been omitted from the list. It forms an octavo pamphlet of 27
pages.

628. ‘‘ Index to the Literature of Uranium, 1789-1885.” By H. Car-
rington Bolton. This is one of a series of bibliographies especially
directed to the indexing of chemical literature. The first part is a
chronological list of memoirs or papers published on the subject, with
references to sources of publication; the second part is an alphabetical
list of authors of the same; and the third part is a subject-matter index,
comprising the various treatments, reactions, characteristics, sources,
&e., of uranium and its compounds. It forms an octavo pamphlet of
36 pages. ‘

629. ‘Report of Prof. Spencer F. Baird, Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, for six months ending June 30, 1885.” In consequence of

Bulletins of the National Museum.—This series and that of the Pro-
ceedings, illustrating the material of the U.S. National Museum, are
issued in the first instance under the authority of the honorable Secre-
tary of the Interior, as prepared by the Smithsonian Institution.

“ Bulletin U.S. National Museum, No. 23. The published writings of
Isaac Lea.” By Newton P. Scudder. This is the second of a proposed
series of bibliographies of American naturalists who have contributed
to the National Museum. The great value of such bibliographies is
fuliy appreciated by all engaged in natural-history studies or investi-
gations. Dr. Lea has for more than half a century contributed to vari-
ous scientific journals the result of his extensive mineralogical and
biological researches; commencing with an account of local minerals,
published in the Journal of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Phila-
delphia, in 1818, and giving, in 1876, a study of ‘ Inclusions” in gems.
Perhaps his most important labor has been the series of investigations
in the land and fresh-water mollusks, and especially in the family of
the Unionide : the earliest of which was published in the Transactions
of the American Philosophical Society, in 1827. Dr. Lea has econtrib-
uted largely of his collections to the National Museum, and at the
advanced age of ninety-four still enjoys good health and complete in-
tellectual vigor. .

Of the present Bulletin the first 53 pages are occupied with a bio-
graphic sketch of the subject. The bibliography proper extends to 171
pages, giving in full the titles and sources of 279 memoirs and other
publications in chronological order. The compilation concludes with a
list of the genera and species discussed and described by Dr. Lea, which
occupies 100 pages. The work forms an octavo volume of lix + 278
pages (including the index), and is illustrated by an engraved portrait
of Dr. Lea.

‘Bulletin U. 8. National Museum, No. 28. A Manual of American
Land Shells.” By W. G. Binney. This work presents an enlarged and
revised edition of the “ Land and Fresh- water Shells of North America:”
Part I; by W.G. Binney and T. Bland; published by the Smithsonian
Institution in 1869, and included in the eighth volume of the Miscel-
laneous Collections. Mr. Thomas Bland, Mr. Binney’s former coadjutor,
is no longer with us, having died August 20, 1885. ‘This treatise, as a
separate volume, has been for some time out of print. The present
~ work has been entirely re-written and re-arranged, occupying 200 more

pages than the earlier work. “Subsequently described species are
added. Fuller attention is given in separate chapters to the subjects
of geographical distribution, organs of generation,jaw and lingual den-
tition, and classification. In the descriptive portion of the work the
species are grouped geographically rather than systematically.” The
subject is treated under the following heads: 1st. Habits and Proper-
ties (9 pp.); 2d. Geographical Distribution (24 pp.); 3d. The Generative
apparatus (2 pp.); 4th. The Jaw and Lingual Membrane (6 pp.); 5th.
Classification (7 pp.); 6th. Systematic Index (8 pp.); and 7th, consti-
tuting the bulk of the volume, Description of Species (412 pp.). Fol-
lowing this is a tabular list (with specified localities and sources) of the
Binney Collection of the Land Shells of North America, presented by
the author to the U. S. National Museum (25 pp.). The work forms an
octavo volume of 528 pages, and is illustrated by 516 wood-cut figures
in the text.

“Bulletin U.S. National Museum, No. 29. Results of Ornithological
Explorations in the Commander Islands and Kamtschatka.” By Leon-
hard Stejneger. The work is divided into three parts: Ist. Review of
the species of birds collected or observed by the author on the Com-
mander Islands, and at Petropaulski, Kamtschatka, 1882-1883 (300 pp.);
2d. Synopsis of the birds reported to inhabit Kamtschatka (20 pp.), and
3d. Conclusions drawn by the author respecting the probable derivation
of this avifauna, and the limitation of its forms. As the result of his
explorations, he maintains ‘ that the peninsula forms a very well circum-
scribed ornitho-geographical province, remarkable not only for a num-
ber of peculiarly modified forms, but also for a surprising absence of
many of the most characteristic forms of the palearctic and circum-
polar ornis.” Regarding Kamtschatka as one of the most typical and
well-defined peninsulas, the conditions of which ‘are such as to make
it a true island, zoologically speaking,” the author ventures the sugges-
tion, ‘‘ there seems to be reason to assume that it has been a real island
at no very distant period.” The work forms an octavo volume of 390
pages, and is illustrated by 7 wood-cut figures in the text, asketch map
of Kamtschatka and adjacent countries, 1 relief-cut bIave, id 7 chromo
lithographic plates.

‘Bulletin U. 8. National Museum, No. 30. Publications relating tu
Fossil Invertebrates.” By John Belknap Marcou. This forms the
third volume of the Bibliographies of American Naturalists, and is de-
voted entirely to a catalogue of the writings of those who have labored
in the field of invertebrate palwontology, in connection with the re-
searches and collections made by the Institution and the National Mu-
seum. The list of memoirs embraces: 1st. The published writings of
Fielding B. Meek, numbering 105 titles of papers (of which one was in
conjunction with Prof. James Hall, 17 in conjunction with Mr. F. V. Hay-
den, and 25 in conjunction with Mr. A. H. Worthen), and occupying 100
pages; 2d. The published writings of Charles A. White, numbering

151 papers (of which 2 were in conjunction with H. A. Nicholson and 2
in conjunction with O. H. St. John), and occupying 66 pages; 3d. The
published writings of Charles D. Walcott, numbering 27 papers and
occupying 15 pages; 4th. A collection from fifteen authors of “¢ Publica-
eations based upon the Palzontological Collections of the United States
Government,” including the titles of 3 papers by Jacob W. Bailey, 12
papers by T. A. Conrad, 5 papers by James D. Dana, 2 papers by
Christian G. Ehrenberg, 7 papers by James Hall (1 in conjunction

with I. B. Meek, above referred to), 2 papers by Angelo Heilprin, 3

papers by Alpheus Hyatt, 10 papers by Jules Marcou, 2 papers by
John 8S. Newberry, 1 paper by I. N. Nicollet, 4 papers by David Dale
Owen, and 5 by Owen and Shumard, 2 papers by Hiram A. Prout,
1 paper by James Schiel, 7 papers by Benjamin F. Shumard, and 5
in conjunction with Owen (above referred to); and lastly, 5 papers
by Robert P. Whitfield ; these occupying 72 pages. An index of gen-
era and species of invertebrate fossils occupies 52 pages. The work
is supplied with a general index of subjects and authors, and forms
an octavo volume of 333 pages.

Proceedings of the National Museum.—Of this series a prompt distri-
bution is made, signature by signature, as fast as each 16 pages of
matter is printed, thus giving the publication somewhat the character
of a periodical.

Volume VIII of the Proceedings of the U.S. National Museum for
1885 has been completed. It contains descriptive papers by Tarleton
H. Bean, Charles W. Beckham, H. G. Beyer, R. A. Brock, W. H. Dall,
Carl H. Kigenman, Walter Faxon, Walter J. Fewkes, J. M. Flint, S.
Garman, G. Brown Goode, V. Havard, O. P. Hay, David 8S. Jordan,

Stearns, Leonhard Stejneger, Charles H. Townsend, Frederick W. True,
Lucien M. Turner, A. E. Verrill, and José C. Zeledon. The volume
contains 762 8ve pages, including introduction, index, and explanatory
pages, and is illustrated by 15 wood-cut figures in the text and 25

plates of.relief cuts.

The Smithsonian Annual Report.—Reference was made in the last

report (pages 337, 338) to an act of Congress approved March 3, 1885,

directing that “the annual reports of the Smithsonian Institution shall
be hereafter printed at the Government Printing Office, in the same

manner as the annual reports of the heads of Departments are now
printed for submission in print to the two houses of Congress.” The
Smithsonian reports had previously been sibmitted to Congress in man-
— uscript, requiring a special resolution each year to secure their printing,

This act, however, did not provide for the printing of any extra copies
for distribution by members of Congress or by the Institution. The
usual resolution was therefore ‘introduced in the Senate, and passed
February 12,1886. Action on this was not taken, however, by the
House of Representatives for five months; when, on July 17, the Sen-
ate resolution was agreed to, as follows:

Resolved, §c., That there be printed of the last annual reports of the Smithsonian
Institution, and of the National Museum, in two octavo volumes, 16,000 extra copies
of each, of which 3,000 copies shall be for the use of the Senate, 6,000 copies for the
use of the House of Representatives, and 7,000 copies for the use of the Smithsonian ©
Institution.

In consequence of the growing importance of the National Museum,
placed by law under the charge of the Smithsonian Institution, the
annual report of the latter for 1884 is for the first time printed in two
parts, or separate volumes, the first part confined to the work of the
Institution itself, showing its operations, expenditures, and condition ;
aud the second part to the progress and condition of the National
Museum.

The first voluame—the report of the Institution proper for 1884—was
not delivered until April, 1886; and the second volume—the report of
the National Museum for the same period, not till several months later.
The first volume contains the Journal of Proceedings of the Board of
Regents of the Institution at the annual meeting held January 21,
1885; the report of the Executive Committee of the Board of Re-
gents, for the year 1884, showing in detail the receipts, appropriations,
and expenditures of the Institution and of the Museum, and their
present financial condition; the report of the Secretary of the Institu-
tion for the year; together with subordinate reports on the operations of
international exchanges, &c. This strictly business portion is followed
by the usual ‘General Appendix,” in which is given a record of the
principal scientific progress for the year, namely, in astronomy by Ed-
ward 8S. Holden; vulcanology and seismology, by Charles G. Rockwood ;
geography, by I’. M. Green; meteorology, by Cleveland Abbe; physics,
by George I’. Barker; chemistry, by H. Carrington Bolton; mineral-
ogy, by Edward 8. Dana; bibliography of North American invertebrate
paleontology, by J.B. Marcou; zoology, by Theodore Gill; and an.
thropology, by Otis T. Mason. In conclusion are given miscellaneous
papers relating to the archeology of Northern and Central America, by .
Charles KE. Vreeland, J. ¥. Bransford, Otis T. Mason, M. T. Leach,
Charles M. Smith, and E. T. Wiltheiss. his part forms an octavo vol-
ume of 943 pages, including introductory matter and index, and is illus-
trated by 7 relief-cut plates and 248 relief-cut figures in the text.

The second volume, ‘ Report of the United States National Museum
for the year 1884,” contains, Part 1, the report of the assistant director;
Part 2, reports of the curators and acting curators; Part 3, papers rel-

Bibliography of the Museum, including publications of the Museum,
papers by officers of the Museum, and other papers based on Museum
material; and lastly, as an appendix, Part 5, a list of accessions to the
Museum during the year, occupying 44 pages. This report forms an
octavo volume of ix + 458 pages, and is illustrated by 105 relief-cut
plates.

I regret to state that no copies of the Report of 1885 (though for
some time stereotyped) have yet been received from the Public Printer.

Publications of the Bureau of Ethnology.—During the past year has
been issued the “ Third Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology to
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,” by J. W. Powell, Director.
In addition to the report of the Director, occupying 62 pages, are given
as accompanying papers ‘ Notes on certain Maya and Mexican Manu-
scripts,” by Cyrus Thomas; ‘On Masks, Labrets, and certain aboriginal
customs,” by William H. Dall; “Omaha Sociology,” by J. Owen Dorsey;
“6 Navajo Weavers,” by Dr. Washington Matthews; ‘“ Prehistoric Tex-
tile Fabrics of the United States, derived from impressions on Pottery,”
by W. H. Holmes; concluding with “Illustrated catalogue of a portion
of the collections made during the field season of 1881,” by W. H.
Holmes ; and “ Illustrated catalogue of the collections obtained from
the Pueblos of New Mexico and Arizona in 1881,” by James Stevenson.

The work forms an imperial octavo volume of Ixxiv + 606 pages,
illustrated by 200 wood-cut figures in the text, and 44 full-page plates,
of which 2 are printed in colors.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The system of free exchanges of the scientific productions of learned
societies and of individuals, including their distribution to public libra-
ries and universities throughout the world, early established by this
Institution as one of its most important interests and services, continues
to increase annually, with the extending recognition at home and abroad
of its great utility in promoting ‘‘ the increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge among men.”

Statistics.— For the year ending June 30, 1886, the receipts for fereign
transmission were 94,093 packages, weighing 195,404 pounds. The trans-
missions filled 764 boxes, having an aggregate bulk of 5,208 cubic feet.

For domestic exchanges the number of parcels received and distrib-
uted during the fiscal year was 14,496, of which 2,533 parcels (or about
one-sixth), were received for the library of the Institution.

For Government exchanges in the same time were received 29 boxes
containing 56,229 packages, and 114 boxes wer3 sent abroad.
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

As compared with the receipts at quinquennial periods for the past
15 years the steady increase is well shown in the following table:

In 1871 and 1876 the exchanges of Government publications were
not separately registered; the aggregate weight for the year 1876 has

been approximately estimated. Notwithstanding the extraordinary —

stimulus given to the foreign exchanges in 1876, by reason of the Cen-
tennial Exhibition held that year, the years immediately succeeding
showed no falling off in the total amount of material presented, but on
the contrary a continual enlargement of the work.

Assistance by the Government.—In view of the great public and national
services rendered by the exchange system, in the distribution of Gov-
ernment publications, and in the large accessions of valuable works
annually made through its instrumentality to the Congressicnal Library,
an appropriation has for some years past been granted by Congress in
aid of this enterprise. And without this support the operations of the
exchange service would be very seriously restricted. The usual appro-
priation of $10,000 was granted to the Institution by the last Congress.
The total expenses of conducting the international exchanges, for the
last few years, are shown in the following table:

22 : REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Government Puchanges.—The Smithsonian Institution, as is well known,
has been made by law the agent of the United States Government for
conducting the international exchanges of public official documents be-
tween it and foreign Governments. By joint resolution of Congress
(approved March 2, 1867), it was ordered that “ fifty copies of all docu-
ments hereafter printed by order of either house of Congress, and fifty
copies additional of all documents printed in excess of the usual num-
ber, together with fifty copies of each publication issued by any Depart-
ment or Bureau of the Government, be placed at the disposal of the
Joint Committee on the Library, who shall exchange the same, through
the agency of the Smithsonian Institution, for such works published in
foreign countries, and especially by foreign Governments, as may be
deemed by said committee an equivalent; said works to be deposited in
the Library of Congress.” And by supplemental joint resolution to
carry the same into better effect (approved July 25, 1868), the Con-
gressional Printer, whenever he shall be so directed by the Joint Com-
mittee on the Library, is required to print fifty copies in addition to the
regular number of all documents hereafter printed by order of either
house of Congress, or by order of any Department or Bureau of the
Government, and whenever he shall be so directed by the Joint Com-
mittee on the Library, one hundred copies additional of all documents
ordered to be printed in excess of the usual number; said fifty or one
hundred copies to be delivered to the Librarian of Congress, to be ex-
changed under the direction of the Joint Committee on the Library, as
provided by joint resolution approved March 2, 1867.

Since the international movement, commencing with the Paris con-
vention of 1875, for promoting the free reciprocal exchange of public
documents, there has been a growing interest in the subject manifested
abroad. International conferences, for agreeing upon details, were held
at Brussels, Belgium, in 1880, in 1883, and finally in 1886—Marceh 15.
There are now thirty-seven Governments in exchange with the United
States, or, counting the duplicate sets sent to the Dominion of Canada
(deposited at Ottawa and Toronto), there may be said to be thirty-eight
foreign recipients. These are: The Argentine Confederation, Bavaria,
Belgium, Brazil, Buenos Aires, Canada, two sets (one for the parlia-
mentary library at Ottawa, the other for the legislative library at
Toronto), Chili, Colombia (United States of), Denmark, France, Ger-
many, Great Britain, Greece, Hayti, Hungary, India, Italy, Japan,
Mexico, Netherlands, New South Wales, New Zealand, Norway, Portu-
gal, Prussia, Queensland, Russia, Saxony, South Australia, Spain,
Sweden, Switzerland, Tasmania, Turkey, Venezuela, Victoria, and Wiir-
temberg.

During the past year boxes 24, 25, and 26 of the series of United
States official publications have been sent to each of the above Gov-
ernments.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

The Library of Congress.—By the joint resolutions of 1867 and 1868,
above referred to, the ‘“‘ works published in foreign countries, and es-
pecially by foreign Governments,” that may be obtained by our inter-
national exchanges, are directed ‘*to be deposited in the Library of
Congress.” This great national institution thus becomes the beneficiary
of this branch of the service, and it is a matter of public interest that
such returns should be placed on their broadest basis.

From the last annual report of the Librarian, Mr. A. R. Spofford (for
the calendar year 1885), the following remarks are quoted as here
eminently appropriate:

“Under the authority of these acts [above cited] the publications of
the United States have been sent regularly each year to thirty-eight
foreign Governments, whose officers responded favorably to overtures
for regular exchanges. Very inadequate returns, however, have been
received from some countries, while from others very rich and impor-
tant stores of documents, including legal, political, historical, and scien-
tific publications, have come tohand. Repeated efforts have been made
by correspondence conducted with foreign Governments, through the
Smithsonian Institution and the Department of State, to secure more
adequate returns from:the Governments to which the publications of
the United States (an extensive and costly series) have been so liberally
supplied through a long series of years. Very slight results, however,
have attended these endeavors. A few desultory returns were occasion-
ally received, followed by an entire stoppage of the transmission of
documents. The results of the exchanges thus far has been to supply
the Library with many publications of permanent value and with many
more fragmentary sets of laws, journals, reports, and miscellaneous
publications, the principal value of which to the collection depends
upon the completeness of the series. The deficiencies in all these series

_are very extensive, thus depriving Congress of that full access to the
current legislation and condition of foreign countries which is so im-
portant to those seeking official information thereon.

Jt has long been apparent that no permanent improvement in the
_very defective operations of these international exchanges can be ex-
pected until some special agency js organized in Europe to give personal
attention to the practical business of securing full returns of all Govern-
ment publications. The distribution of documents is scattered in most
Governments among different bureaus, with no common head. More-
over, most Government publications are issued by arrangement with
private publishing houses, instead of by Government presses, thus
rendering the books to a partial extent publications to which a commer-
cial value is attached, and complicating the question of exchange with
that of a pecuniary valuation of publications given and received. In
very few countries is there any general law regulating this matter,
while the various international conferences held at Paris and at Brussels
with a view to the adoption of a uniform system of exchanges have
failed to enlist the co-operation of several of the most important Euro-
pean Governments. Moreover, there are issued many special pubiica-
tions which can be obtained only by special efforts. An agent of the
United States, either constantly upon the ground, or visiting periodically
at regular intervals the bureaus of the Government in the various coun-
tries, supplied with full lists both of our wants and of the publications,
regular and special, of the Government presses, would furnish a per-
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

manent and, it may be added, the only efficient guarantee of realizing
from the system of international exchanges what we have a right to
expect.

An initiatory step was taken during the last Congress, when an agent
in the employ of the Smithsonian Institution, in charge of its exchange
system, was sent to Europe, one-half of his expenses being paid by the
Institution and one-half out of the Library funds. The results of the
experiment, although a first attempt in a new field, were most gratify-
ing. In the few months devoted to the labor, there were secured by
diligent effort, backed by the requisite official authority from the Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution, the Department of State, and the
Librarian of Congress, very extensive returns of public documents and
miscellaneous publications. These returns comprised forty-four cases
and one hundred and sixty packages of books, numbering about 7,000
volumes, received in 1884—’85, and were collected from the Governments
of Great Britain, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands,
Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Hungary, Saxony, Wiirtemberg, Bavaria,
and Switzerland, fourteen Governments in all. Vienna was also visited,
but affairs were not in a state favorable to the success of negotiations,
and no result was reached as to the publications of the Austrian Goy-
ernment. Several other Governments from which returns were thus
secured, have also failed to continue sending the series of their parlia-
mentary and other documents, the value of which is largely dependent
upon their continuity.

The experience of years has amply proved the impossibility of secur-
ing any complete or adequate return from foreign Governments for the
full and costly series of American Government publications so long fur-
nished them, without direct and persistent effort, through an agency
upon the ground, furnished with adequate credentials, to attend per-
sonally to the whole business. One of the chief benefits of the initial
effort already made has been the discovery of the practical obstacles in
the way of a thoroughly successful system of exchanges. These, it is
believed, could be removed by following up the work with each Govern-
ment, while, if neglected, or left to the very uncertain medium of cor-
respondence, the United States will continue to reap very inadequate
returns for our publications sent abroad. It is reeommended that the
Joint Committee on the Library consider the expediency of providing
an appropriation to defray the necessary expenses of an agent of inter-
national exchanges, to be sent abroad for a.term of at least six months
during the present year.

It is also recommended that the act directing the printing of fifty
copies of each publication ordered by any Department or Bureau, to be
devoted to international exchanges, be so amended as to render its pro-
visions more effective.”

LIBRARY.

The fact should constantly be borne in mind that the distribution of
the publications of the Institution secures in return a large amount of
valuable material which is deposited in the Library of Congress. What-
ever cost, therefore, there may be to our Government for Smithsonian or
Museum reports, &c., is many times repaid by the exchanges received,
in addition to which the returns for the many volumes of publications
printed entirely at the expense of the Smithsonian fund find the same
depository.

26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Five years have elapsed since (the latter part of 1881) the work of
moving into the new Museum building was begun. Two years ago I
reported that the packing boxes, several thousand in number, contain-
ing the accumulations of many previous years, had for the most part
been unpacked, and that the entire floor space of the building would
be soon oceupied by exhibition collections. During the current year
this hoped-for result has been finally attained, and (with the exception
of one corner of one of the central halls still occupied by one or two
collections received at the close of the New Orleans exhibition, and
which have not been opened on account of delay in preparation of cases
for their reception) the entire floor space of about 100,000 square feet is
open to the public, and the collections arranged in accordance with the
provisional plan of installation. The work of mounting and labelling
is still in progress, and each month shows marked advances. From this
time forward, however, it will be impossible to develop the collections
satisfactorily without additional space. The laboratories and workshops
are entirely inadequate for the storage of the unexhibited collections
and the accommodation of the preparators and mechanics, and the ex-
hibition halls do not afford suitable opportunity for the display of the
materials already in order for public examination. Each collection,
and above all each department, should have a hall of its own, more or
less completely isolated from those which adjoin it. When several col-
lections are placed side by side in the same department much is lost
in respect to effect and convenience of study, not to mention the still
greater disadvantage of overerowded space.

As soon as Congress shall see fit to provide another Museum building,
the collections being now so completely under control, and the force of
curators, assistants, and preparators so well organized and so thoroughly :
prepared for the task, within eighteen months, or at the most two years,
a@ space twice as large as that now occupied can be filled with cases of
specimens thoroughhky mounted for exhibition.

The development of the Museum during the past year has been -
unexpectedly great, as may be judged from the fact that about fifteen
hundred separate lots of specimens have been received.- A certain pro-
portion of these were obtained from Government expeditions and surveys
and material of perhaps equal value through exchange, but by far the
largest part of the increase, both in quantity and value, has been in
the form of gifts.

It is perhaps too early in the history of the Museum to take into
consideration the question of the extent and nature of its future devel-
opment. Such institutions are most successful and useful when the
result of natural processes of growth.

We may profit to a certain extent by the experience of other nations,
but the National Museum of the United States will of necessity have

features peculiar to itself, developed in response to the peculiar needs
of the people of this continent. it should be remembered that the na-
tional collections of every principal European nation are divided into
several groups, each under separate administration, though often under
the general control of some central authority. In France, for instance, -
most of the museums are under the Ministry of Public Instruction, and
in England, to a less extent, under the Department of Science and Art.

In London, in Paris, in Berlin, and in Vienna the public collections
are scattered through various parts of the city, in museums with dis-
tinctive names and more or less independent organizations, and by no
means always harmonious with each other. Much of the work which
should properly be done by these museums is omitted, because none of
them have seen fit to undertake it, and, on the other hand, much work
is duplicated, which is perhaps equally unfortunate, collections of simi-
lar scope and purpose being maintained in different parts of the same
city. One of the chief objections to such division of effort is that much
of the value of large collections in any department is lost by failure to
concentrate them where they may be studied and compared side by
side. In Washington the national collections are all, without ex-
ception, concentrated in one set of buildings. The Army Medical Mu-
seum will soon oceupy a building side by side with those under the
control of the Smithsonian Institution, and this proximity and the long
established policy of co-operation between the two institutions will ren-
der them, for all practical purposes, united.

It is possible that, in the future, museums of specialties, occupying
buildings of their own, may grow up under the control of other Execu-
tive Departments of the Government, but it is not likely that they will
be very remote from the chain of museum buildings already in process of
formation, and a harmonious system of co-operation will doubtless al-
ways be practicable. In the mean time the Smithsonian Institution, as
the legal custodian of Government collections, should undoubtedly pre-
serve everything which may be serviceable for the development in
Washington of one of the greatest museums in the world. It will be
neither practicable nor desirable to gather together in Washington col-
lections of ancient and medieval art, such as those which adorn the
capitals of Europe; but a representative series of such objects will un-
doubtedly grow up which shall be sufficiently large and welt selected to
enable Americans to understand these subjects in a general way, to edu-
cate the public taste, and to promote, so far as possible, the study of
the elements of art and the history of civilization, as well as to forward
the growth of the arts of design. This having been accomplished, a
large part of the attention of the Museum would naturally be directed
toward the exhibition of the geology and natural history of America,
and at the same time its natural resources, to the preservation of me-
moriais of its aboriginal inhabitants, and the exposition of the arts and
jndustries of America.
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In referring to the industries of America it is not intended to recom-
mend that anything similar to what is generally understood as an ‘ in-
dustrial exhibition” should be attempted. The element of competitive
display should not be admitted, and no two objects of precisely similar
jmport should ever be placed side by side, least of all, if of modern
manufacture. . Such has hitherto been the policy of the Museum, and
should it ever be interfered with, it is to be feared that much of the use-
fulness of the Museum would be destroyed, both from a scientific and
educational standpoint.

The principal European museums have been carefully studied by
officers of the Museum, and we have already profited largely by the
knowledge thus gained of their successes and their failures. A report
upon: the great museums of the world is in preparation and will proba-
bly be published next year.

It must be remembered that the *‘ National Museum” is actually of re-
cent origin, although the idea has been under consideration for many
years. As recently as 1877 the appropriation made by Congress for its
support was only $10,000. The “ National Museum” was not recognized
by that name in the Congressional appropriation bills until 1876, al-
though the term was used in the reports of the Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution as early as 1868,* and although the national collec-
tions were transferred to the custody of the Institution in 1858, in ac-
cordance with the act of incorporation passed in 1846, by which it is
‘provided that ‘all objects of art and of foreign and curious research,
and all objects of naturul history, plants, and geological and mineral-
ogical specimens belonging or hereafter to belong to the United States,
which may be in the city of Washington,” shall be delivered to the Re.

Nearly halfa century has passed since the United States, by the pro-
visions of the will of James Smithsoii, first became proprietor of a scien-
tific collection, in the shape of the Smithson minerals and meteorites;
it is forty-five years since the National Institute was founded, with great
prestige and influence, for the avowed purpose of organizing a National
Museum of Natural History; forty since Congress threw upon the
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution the responsibility of caring for
the so-called “ National Cabinet of Curiosities ;” twenty-nine since this
responsibility was finally accepted and these collections were transferred
to the Smithsonian building; thirty-seven since the Institution began
to make collections of its own; ten since Congress formally adopted

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

the National Museum as its ward, and five since the Museum has had
a shelter exclusively its own and an appropriation in any way adequate
to the necessities of its administrative work. With the year 1850 be-
gan an epoch in the history of the Museum, since at this time Congress
saw fit to recognize the claims of the Museum by increasing the appro-
priations for its preservation and installation from $45,000 to $145,000.

Their responsibility in the matter they had, however, recognized in
1879 by appropriating $250,000 for the construction of a fire-proof build-
ing. The claims of the Museum to increased support had been before
them for three or four years, ever since, indeed, by their own act, in
connection with the preparations for the participation of the Govern-
ment Departments in the International Exposition in Philadelphia, and
the valuable gifts of foreign Governments upon that occasion, the
Smithsonian building had been filled to overflowing with unassorted
material of the highest value for educational and scientific uses.

Thirteen years ago, as Assistant Secretary, I pointed out in my report

to the Secretary of the Institution that the annual growth of the Mu-
seum was undoubtedly greater than that of any other in the world;
that is, so far as the accession of great masses of material was con-
cerned. The increase at present is much greater than formerly, but
the accessions are much more manageable, owing to the larger number
of assistants employed. For twenty years the Assistant Secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution, with the help of one or two laborers and
‘such students as happened to volunteer their aid, performed ali the
duties of curatorship of the national collections. It was not until 1874
that a special staff of Museum assistants was recognized, with duties
apart from the executive work of the Institution, and not until 1875 that -
the office of curator was established, that office being held by the as-
sistant secretary from 1875 to 1878. Up to 1880 there was still but one
curator, with a number of “ assistants,” but during that year an execu-
tive officer, with the grade of assistant director, was appointed, and the
five principal assistants in the Museum were designated curators. The
present organization of the personnel, then, dates back only five years,
to the time when preparations were being made for taking possession
of the new building.

The staff, as now organized, consists of two classes, the scientific offi-
cers or curators, and the administrative officers; the former reporting
to the Director of the Museum, the latter to the assistant director, who
also has general supervision of the administrative work of the curators.

There are at present 28 curatorships, some of which are divided, so
that the number of heads of departments or sub-departments is 26,
and the total number of men in the scientific staff 30, of whom 13 are in
the pay of the Museum, and the others are honorary, some being detailed
for this duty by the Director of the Geological Survey, by the Director
of the Bureau of Ethnology, others by the Commissioner of Fish and
Fisheries, and by the Secretary of the Navy, two being volunteers. It
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

may be stated that these details are in every instance made in the
interests of co-operation by those Bureaus of the Government engaged
in work closely connected with that of the Museum. The paleon-
tologists of the Geological Survey find it so much to their advantage to
have access to the paleontological collections of the Museum and the
use of the laboratories, storage cases, and general administrative appli-
ances of the Museum, that they are permitted by their chief to assume
the responsibilities of curatorships and perform a general work of super-
vision. In nearly every case, however, the Museum supplies the honor-
ary curators with assistants, who relieve them of much of the routine
work.

Very few important changes or additions have been made during the
fiscal year covered by this report.

In the departments of mollusks and of entomology, an assistant cu-
rator has been appointed, the honorary curators of these departments
having found it impossible to attend to the routine work as well as
identify, classify, and arrange the specimens for exhibition and study
purposes.

A brief review of what has been accomplished in each department
during the year will be, perhaps, the most satisfactory mode of bring-
ing before the Regents the present methods and tendencies of the work
in the Museum. I shall not however attempt to discuss the additions
of the year, except so far as these are incidentally referred to as the re-
sults of explorations made under the direction, or with the co-operation
of the Institution. A list of these, with geographical and topograph-
ical indices, and a list of donors, will be found in the second part of this
report, in connection with the detailed reports of the Assistant Director
and curators of the Museum upon its current work.

A census of the collections made in 1884 showed an estimated total of
1,471,000 “lots” of specimensin the Museum. The number atthe present
time is 2,420,934. The total number of “‘lots” of specimens received
during the year and separately entered on the record of accessions is
1,496, including 6,890 separate packages. The construction of cases has
been constantly in progress, and during the year there have been re-
ceived and fitted for use and placed in the exhibition halls 84 cases,
chiefly of the standard patterns. Forty-five storage cases have been
made for use in the laboratories, 5,400 wooden drawers and trays, and
54,000 pasteboard trays. There have also been purchased 3,504 glass
jars, for storage and exhibition of alcoholic specimens, and 24 barrels
(1,115 gallons) of 98 per cent. alcohol.

The chief clerk of the Museum recently appointed has given much of
his time during the past year to reorganizing and supervising the depart-
ment of property and supplies; methodizing and formulating rules and
regulations for governing the same. The changes that have been made
have already proven of great practical benefit, simplifying, as they do,

methods of procedure i in purchase of supplies and payment of bills, and!
of locating responsibility for kind and quality of articles furnished and
for their proper use and care.

The distribution of duplicates has been much the same as in previous
years. About twenty-four thousand specimens have been sent out to 118
institutions and societies ; those to institutions in the United States are
generally gifts, though many were sent in the way of exchange. For all
foreign sendings, equivalents in the way of exchange have been received
or promised.

The total number of visitors to the Museum building has been 174,225,
to the Smithsonian building 88,960; the total number considerably
exceeding 200,000. Over 1,000,000 persons are estimated to have vis-
ited the Museum since the completion of the new building.

The publications of the Museum have been carried on with greater
activity than usual during the year, Bulletins numbered 23, 28, 29, and
30 having been published.

In addition to these Bulletins the manuscript of No. 31 was put in
type during the year. Volume VII of the Proceedings of the Museum
for i884 was published in its complete form, and the printing of Vol-
ume VIII for 1885 was completed, and an edition of 200 copies distrib-
uted in signatures. This form of publication has been adopted to secure
the rapid promulgation of the work of the Museum, and the signatures
are placed at once in the hands of the principal scientific institutions
and of specialists who are directly interested in the work in progress
in the Museum. The remainder of the edition of 1,000 copies is pub-
lished in bound volumes, and in time appears for general distribution
in the miscellaneous collections of the Smithsonian Institution.

An order for the publication of Volume IX of the Proceedings (for
1886) was not obtained from the Secretary of the Interior until after
the close of the fiscal year, and for six months the Museum was without
any means of publishing the results of its current work. Several
papers which properly should have been published in this serial were
sent elsewhere to be printed. The Proceedings of the Biological Society
(published with the co-operation of the Smithsonian Institution) was
employed to relieve this temporary lack of publishing facilities. Im-
portant papers by Mr. Ridgway upon the Birds of the Isiand of Cozu-
mel, and other papers by Messrs. Bean, Dresel, Dall, Riley, and Rath-
bun were made public through this medium.

The total number of pages published by the Museum during the year
was 1,642, and that of papers 48; the total number of labels’ printed
was about 6,000. It has not been found necessary to introduce any
changes in the general style of type or form of the labels. The number
of labels now on file is about 25,000, and requires the constant atten-
tion of one person to care for and store them in proper condition for
ready reference. They are arranged in standard unit drawers, about
100 in number, and are delivered to the curators of the several depart-
~ REPORT OF THE SECRETARY,

ments as may be required. There is still much work to be done in
labelling specimens, and it has been found necessary, on account of the
time required in printing, to prepare written labels for temporary dis-
play with many of the exhibits.

The work of the Museum library has been developing on the old lines
of administration, and in addition to the central reference library, which
now ineludes volumes and pamphlets, sectional libraries have been es-
tablished in the scientific departments, each under the control of the
curator, and including the works especially needed by him in his daily
work. All the sectional libraries are, of course, under the supervision
of the librarian.

One of the principal improvements of the year has been the placing
of temporary covers on the collection of pamphlets (of which there are
over 2,000) constituting that part of the library which is most frequently
consulted.

The operations of the staff of preparators are discussed at length in
their proper place. The amount of work accomplished has been equal
to that of previous years, and it is a source of satisfaction to know that
the standard of excellence is improving, not only in respect to individ-
ual excellence but in the manner of labeling and displaying the collec-
tions in the exhibition cases. -We are constantly called upon for plans
of the cases and fittings in use in the Museum, and also to allow officers
of other museums opportunities to study our methods of administration.
At no time during the year have there been less than six or eight
students thus engaged. In response to such applications, as well as to
the letters which are almost daily received, making inquiries into our
methods of work, it is our policy to make a cordial response. Itis con-
sidered germane to the objects of a national museum to render the re-
sults of its labors useful to similar institutions throughout the country,
and to encourage in this way, as well as by the distribution of specimens,
the growth of the museum idea in the United States.

For the purpose of encouraging the new school of taxidermists and
giving encouragement to the movement for theimprovement of mounted
animals in the Museum, a space has been allotted in one of the exhibi-
tion halls to the Society of American Taxidermists, and already a very
creditable collection has been placed on view, the object of which is to
explain the improved. methods of modern taxidermy, and to show ex-
amples of what is considered the highest artistic and mechanical per-
fection in the art. A number of prize pieces from the annual exhibi-
tions of the Society of Taxidermists have been given or lent by their
authors. This collection is under the charge of Mr. Hornaday, chief
taxidermist of the Museum.

The collections sent to the New Orleans Exposition, were all returned
to the Museum shortly after the beginning of the year, and have long
since been restored to their proper places in the exhibition or reserve
series. A considerable number of duplicates thus returned have been
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

placed in storage subject to future calls of similar nature. The assist-
ant director, who represented the Smithsonian Institution in the Gov-
ernment Board in charge of exhibition work, has completed and handed
in to the chairman of the Board his portion of the official report, and
(so far as we have been informed) the work of the Board has been com-
pleted. A number of exhibits obtained by the State Department for
the second New Orleans Exhibition have, since its close in April, been
turned over to the Museum by Mr. C. S. Mill, the representative of that
Department.

I. The Department of Arts and Industries.—In this department, which
is under the curatorship of the Assistant Director of the Museum, Mr.
G. Brown Goode, are assembled together for convenience a number of
special collections mainly of recent origin which may very possibly in
future be grouped in quite different relations. The scope is necessarily
general and indefinite, and I shall simply call attention to the present con-
dition of some of the most important groups of objects which it contains.

The section of textiles already includes a very full series of the ani-
mal and vegetable fibers used throughout the world, together with good
representations of devices for spinning and weaving, and of the various
products of the textile industries. This. collection is nearly all perma-
nently installed, provided with printed labels, and illustrated by dia-
grams. For lack of room, fully half of the material ready for exhi-
bition has been stored away, and the cases prepared for its display are
in boxes in the Armory building. The space assigned to the exhibition
series is still so crowded that the objects cannot be satisfactorily exam-
ined. Work upon this and other allied technological sections under the
charge of Mr. Romyn Hitchcock, being so greatly impeded for lack of
accommodation, he applied for and obtained a furlough of two years,
and, having ea a professorship in the University of Osaka, in
Peon: is making a special study of Oriental technology.

To the collection of food substances, also under the charge of Mr.
Hitchcock, is assigned a large quantity of unassorted material. The few
cases now or exhibition contain the foods of the North American In-
dians, of Japan and China, and some of the more curious and unusual
articles of diet. There: are also two cases of educational importance
which exhibit graphically the composition of the human body and its
daily expenditure of tissues and the manner in which this is compen-
sated for by daily rations of food. This collection is modeled after the
famous collection of similar character prepared by Dr. Lankester and
others for the Bethnal Green Museum in London. It is however based
upon an entirely new series of analyses, and upon a revised plan prepared
by Prof. W. O. Atwater, of Wesleyan University, and corresponds to the
latest views in physiological chemistry.

The collections in chemical technology already have a good nucleus,
and the chemical manufactures and their products and methods should
ultimately occupy a prominent position in the plan of the Museum. ‘The

material now on hand is only incidentally displayed, and a considerable
portion of it is temporarily appropriated with the materia medica col.
lection. :

The collections of materia medica are still under the charge of Dr. H,
G. Beyer, U. S. Navy, detailed by the Surgeon-General of the Navy for
this special duty. Its increase during the year has been greater than
during any previous year except the first, when the nucleus of the col-
lection was formed from the collections received from different national
departments at the Centennial, and the gifts of W. H. Schieffelin & Co.,
of New York, the accessions having been remarkable for their interest
and value. Amongst the most important accessions may be mentioned
those received from the Governments of Jamaica, Japan, and Mexico:
the collection of Dr. Edward Palmer from the States and Territories of
the Southwest; and the gifts of F. Stearns & Co., of Detroit, Mich.,
and W. 8. Thompson, of Washington, D. C.

There are 3,326 specimens on exhibition, to 1,457 of which are attached
printed labels. The entire collection now includes 4,850 specimens, and
409 entries have been added to the catalogue during the year. A de-
scriptive catalogue of the collection is now in preparation and will prob-
ably be completed in the coming year.

The attention of the curator has been devoted especially to perfect-
ing and completing the collection in accordance with the very elaborate
plan which is presented in Part II, of the Muserm Report.

In addition to the work upon the collection the curator has been
carrying on important investigations on the physiological action of drugs.
Seven original papers embodying the results of his investigations have
been published, two are in press, and others are in progress.

Since the hall containing the fisheries collection was opened to the
public, in May, 1584, there has been constant improvement in the con-
dition of the material exhibited, and a number of important additions
have been made, although from the fact that the collections are already
so complete, its growth has been comparatively less extensive than that
of the other departments. The fisheries of North America are already
so thoroughly represented that there can be but little necessity for ex-
tending this portion of the department except by keeping it abreast of
the time, by exhibiting modern improvements in apparatus, and by the
building up of certain local series of slight importance, such as the
Chinese fishery apparatus from the Pacific coast. There are still want-
ing illustrations of the foreign fisheries, some of which have been filled
since this department has been referred to in this report. Important
collections have been received from the Government of Siam, through
Minister Halderman ; from the Government of Japan; and the exten-
sive collections from Great Britain, Sweden, Spain, France, Holland,
and Greece, acquired at the close of the London Exhibition, have been
since incorporated in the exhibition series.
j REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

_ No department of the Museum is perhaps more at a disadvantage from
the limited space which it occupies than this. In the recent exhibition
at London, the American section alone occupied nearly three times the

space which is here occupied by fishery exhibits from all parts of the

world. Many important things cannot be displayed, others of interest
are suspended from the wall at so great a height that they are seen by
but few, and cannot be examined by those who know of their existence,
while it is impossible to group together by countries, properly, series of
specimens which would be much improved by this kind of installation.
Furthermore, the cases are so closely massed that the availability of the
collection is interfered with. The section of fish-culture is almost en-
tirely crowded out, many of the most important objects having been sent
elsewhere for storage. The fisheries collection has been for the past two
years under the curatorship of R. Edward Earl], who also has in hand
the collection of animal products, which, since the return of the collee-
tious from the New Orleans Exhibition, has been installed in a very
effective manner in one of the large central halls. This collection, which
was begun in connection with the Philadelphia Exhibition and greatly
extended for that of New Orleans, is of great popular interest, as well
as of considerable economic importance. The 1,597 specimens now on
exhibition illustrate the applications of all products derived from the
animal kingdom in the arts and industries. Not more than half the ma-
terial available for the purpose is now displayed to the public, though
this collection like that of fisheries is one which derives much of its
value from having each class represented by a large number of speci-
mens, since every additional well selected object adds: to the interest

of the objects exhibited. The total number of specimens is 2,793.

The collection of historic relics includes objects of national interest
relating to the history of soldiers, statesmen, and important events, and
includes several hundred objects. This collection has been increased
during the year by the addition of many manuscript papers, including
letters, military orders, and other official papers, pertaining to the co-
lonial Government and to the periods of the Revolutionary and later
wars. The most prominent exhibit is that of the Washington relics,
transferred to the Museum in 1883 by the Commissioner of Patents,
and consisting of several hundred objects, including many articles of
household use, that belonged to Washington, besides his tents and
camp equipage, used by him during the Revolutionary war. There are
also many relies of other soldiers and naval officers, presented to them
by foreign Governments. Among these may be mentioned swords and
guns presented to President Jefferson, Commodore Perry, General Rip-
ley, General Grant, and others. There are also memorials of many of
the Arctie expeditions sent out by the United States and English Goy-
ernments during the last forty years, including relies of Sir John Frank-
lin, McClintock, Kane, Hall, and De Long’s expeditions. There have
been added during the year a number of relics of the Southern Confed -
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

eracy, and it is hoped to largely increase this interesting collection by
the addition of similar memorials of the Northern armies. The collec-
tion of coins and medals is receiving some additions, and already about
2,000 specimens have been placed on exhibition. The medals pertain-
ing to the history of the United States were deposited in the Museum
by the Director of the Mint, and include bronze copies in duplicate of
all the medals that have been struck at the Mint since its organization.
Numerous foreign medals, presented to the Smithsonian Institution at
various times, are also arranged in this collection. The coin series is
fast increasing, and much work has been done in classifying and label-
ing about 2,000 specimens of ancient Greek and Roman coins, recently
presented to the Museum. It is intended to arrange a series of the coins
by countries, showing with them also paper currency and postage
stamps, giving, as far as possible, the history of each coinage. Mr. A.
Howard Clark has been placed in charge of this specialty.

Closely related to the historical collection is the series illustrating the
history of steam transportation, under the charge of Mr. J. E. Watkins,
of Camden, N. J. The John Bull engine, imported from England in
1831, the model after which all subsequent American engines have °
been constructed, has been given to the Museum by the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company and placed on exhibition; and adjoining this is a
case in which there are already assembled about forty objects illustrating
the beginnings of the American railroad system. It is greatly to be
heped that this important subject may be given an opportunity to grow.

The collection of scientific instruments owes its interest at present
chiefly to the historical associations of most of the apparatus displayed,
including as it does instruments used by Priestly, Henry, and Hare.
The original telegraphic instrument of Morse and Vail is also here
shown.

The collections of musical instruments, modern pottery, and porcelain,
lacquer, and the process of engraving are partially displayed, and when
cases and floor space shall become available, will soon develop into im-
portant features.

II. (A) Department of Ethnology—tThe growth of the department of
Ethnology during the year has been very great. The principal efforts
of the curator, Prof. O. T. Mason, are still in the direction of reducing
material to systematic order and arranging it in a manner available for
future study and exhibition. Much more space is necessary for the
proper prosecution of this work. Owing to this fact, as well as to delay
in construction of cases and printing of labels, several series nearly
ready for final display cannot at present be exhibited.

The department, although one of the largest, is one of the youngest
in the Museum. To the science of ethnology have not been applied
hitherto those rules of strict classification long prevalent in the other
natural sciences, and it has fallen to the lot of the new curator to de-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37

velop a detailed system of arrangement in connection with the prelimi-
nary handling of the collections. With this object in view, certain
rooms and areas have been assigned, and in these have been grouped,
with special reference to their final installation, certain large classes of
objects, such as the weapons of war and the chase, implements of agri-
culture, and other primitive industries. In addition to these great
series of objects, classified according to function, other groups of objects
have been arranged in accordance with another idea of classification,
which is deemed of equal importance, namely, that of race.

The Eskimo collection, for instance, has been arranged in table cases
in one of the exhibition halls, in accordance with the ethnic idea, although
in the minor details of classification function and form, as well as geo-
graphical distribution, have been followed.

A preliminary study of the collection of basketry has been compieted.
A paper upon the baskets of uncivilized peoples, with numerous illus-
trations, was published in the Museum report for 1884, and a represent-
ative series placed on exhibition with provisional labels. The throwing-
sticks and sinew back-bows have been the subject of papers, and are
now on exhibition. The curator has in progress investigations upon
several groups of objects, notably the history and technology of archery;
upon transportation as effected by man without the aid of domestic
animals or mechanism; upon the peculjar industries of several handi-
crafts; upon the Hoopah Indians of California.

The underlying ideas in these investigations, a first installment o
which was published in the last report of this Museum, are (1) that
the methods of strict classification and nomenclature already applied
in the other natural sciences are equally applicable to anthropology; (2)
that a trustworthy and minute study of modern savage and barbarous
technique is absolutely requisite to the archeologist and technologist
in reconstructing the history of civilization.

II (B). Department of American Aboriginal Poitery—The collections
in this department have continued to increase with astonishing rapidity,
and the extensive accessions which have been received through the
Bureau of Ethnology, and from other sources, have been of the great-
est scientific importance and popular interest. One of the four large
central halls of the Museum is devoted entirely to this subject, and the
removal of the collections of South American aboriginal pottery and of
the extensive collections from the mounds which have for many years
been accumulating in the Archeological Hall of the Smithsonian build-
ing, have filled it up to such an extent that it is difficult to find room
for the new material as it comes in.

During the year a portion of the hall has been thrown open to the
public, although it has been necessary to retain one-half of the floor space
as a work room. The exhibition case surrounding the walls of this
room is probably the largest in existence in any museum, being 260 feet
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

in length, 4 feet 9 inches in depth, and, being double throughout, its
entire length is virtually 520 feet. Double the space now allotted this
department is necessary for its proper display, and the value of the
material here concentrated is practically inestimable, since even the
modern tribes, who are still making pottery similar in its general char-
acter to that which is here preserved, have deteriorated to such a
degree in their artistic capacity or skill, that their products are not
therefore an exponent of their original artistic capabilities. So ex-
haustive and monographie is this collection that it is impossible that
any thorough work can be done upon the American aboriginal pottery
which shall not in great part be based upon this collection.

The detail from the Bureau of Ethnology of Mr. William H. Holmes
as honorary curator of this department has been continued.

In addition to his administrative work, he has been engaged in the
preparation of a monograph of a number of collections from the prov-
ince of Chiriqui in Colombia.

The coilections made under the direction of the Bureau of Ethnology
in the Mississippi Valley by Dr. Cyrus Thomas, are deserving of special
mention, as well as those of Col. James Stevenson and Mr. E. W. Nelson
in the Pueblo country of the Southwest.

Ill. Department of Antiquities—The report of the curator, Dr. Rau,
for the current year, is an exhaustive geographical review of the acces-
sions, some of the most important of which are illustrated by draw-
ings. The total number of accessions has been 2,751; all excepting 84
were of sufficient importance to be added to the exhibition and study
series, which now include over 40,000 specimens. In thearrangement of
the archeological collections, Dr. Rau is taking advantage of the addi-
tional space placed at his command by the removal of the ethnological
collections to the new building, to display his material in a manner more
instructive to the public and more useful to the special investigator.

The general collection is now, and was in the past, arranged primarily
by material; all objects of stone are together, as are also those of cop-
per, bone, horn, shell, clay, and wood; secondarily by form and fune-
tion, stone pestles, arrow-heads, or knives are placed together, the
rudest and most primitive beginning the series, the most perfect at its
close, the locality of each specimen being clearly indicated upon its
label. Stone celts are arranged, and similar groups are made of ham-
mered knives, &c.; thirdly, a progressive arrangement is adopted, the
rudest and most primitive of the celts, for instance, being at the be-
ginning of the series, and the most perfect and elaborate at the end.

During the year one hundred and nineteen of these special collec-
tions have been* placed on exhibition. This form of special collection
is becoming of great importance in this department as well as in the
department of ethnology which has already been referred to. The rapid
increase at the present time in the department of archeology is due to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

the work done by the parties sent out for exploration by the Bureau of
Ethnology. This policy, although more thoroughly carried out than
has been practicable hitherto, dates back to the jearly history of the
Museum. Certain monographic collections of this sort have been on
exhibition since 1870 or longer.

Dr. Rau is engaged upon the preparation of an illustrated work on
North American prehistoric objects, which is designed to serve as a
guide for visitors to the department and as an explanation of the termi-
nology of North American archeology. This will bear the title, Haya
Classification of the North American Prehistoric Relics in the United
States National Museum.” This book will be fully illustrated and it is
hoped will be published in the ensuing year.

IV. Department of Mammals.—The most important accessions to this
department in this, as in previous years, have been in the shape of single
specimens sent from zoological gardens and menageries, which have
shown a great deal of liberality to the Museum in this respect.

The administrative work of the department has been directed chiefly
to the preparation for an entire rearrangement of the exhibition series,
when the promised new eases shall have been completed. Many of the
most valuable specimens in the mounted series are of such a large size
that it has not hitherto been practicable to inclose them under glass or
to protect them from mutilation. The larger laboratory rooms into
which the department moved just before the beginning of the year
have been utilized for an entire rearrangement of the collection which
hitherto has been stored in the bases of the cases in the exhibition hall.
The entire collection has been carefully studied and identified with,the
exception of the Soricide, and good progress was made in the prepara-
tion of the card catalogue of the collection.

The curator, Mr. F. W. True, has in progress extensive investigations
on American cetaceans, and is at present engaged upon a revision of
the dolphins of the world. During the yearhe visited various points
on the coast of North Carolina, in behalf of the Fish Commission, to se-
cure material for his work. A report was prepared during the year upon
the mammals collected by E. W. Nelson and C. L. McKay in Alaska.

V (A). Department of Birds.—The growth of the department during
the year has been very satisfactory, the number of specimens added to
the collection being 4,147. The largest single accession was the collec-
tion made by the U. S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross in the
Bahamas, of 1,000 specimens and about 75 species, of which 5 were new
to science. Another valuable collection, 243 specimens, 81 species, 1
new to the fauna of North America, was obtained in Alaska by Mr.
Charles H. Townsend while on a mission for the Fish Commission. Mr.
Henry Seebohm, of London, has given to the Museum 171 specimens,
68 species, chiefly from Siberia, and of great value to the collections,
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

An important part of the administrative work of the curator has been
the extension of the collections through exchange, and several of the
most important accessions have been thus acquired. Among the most
important exchanges have been those with the Musee d’Histoire Nat-
urelle, of Paris, 86 specimens, 79 species, from Madagascar and Cochin
China; with the British Museum, 225 specimens, 179 species, from In-
dia and Europe; with the Mexican Geographical Exploring Expedition,
135 specimens, 75 species, and with Count Hans Von Berlepsch, of
Miifiden, Germany, 60 specimens, 50 species, of South American birds.
Two thousand five hundred and eighty-one specimens have been sent
out in exchange and a full equivalent received. The routine work has
been pushed forward as rapidly as possible, the exhibition series having
been entirely arranged and twelve additional exhibition cases filled.
More than half of the mounted collection has been transferred to exhi-
bition stands of the improved standard, recently adopted. The final
labeling of the exhibition series has been deferred by delays at the
Government Printing Office, and advantage has been taken of the delay
to revise the labels, in order that they may accord with the order of
classification adopted by the American Ornithologists’ Union. The
** Code and Check-list of North American Birds,” adopted by the Ameri-
ean Ornithologists’ Union, which has been published during the year,
was prepared by a committee of the Union holding its sessions in the
Ornithological Laboratory of the Museum, and the systematic work in-
volved was based upon the national collections. The almost universal
adoption of this check-list in America, and the consequent harmony of
arrangement between the national collections and those in museum col-
lections throughout the country, will not only greatly facilitate the work
of this department in the future, but will be of great advantage to the
progress of ornithology.

The curator, Mr. Ridgway, and the assistant curator, Dr. Stejneger,
have published about fifty papers upon the collections during the year,
occupying about 500 octavo pages.

Among the investigations in progress are Mr. Ridgway’s studies
of Hmpidonax, Puffinus, Larus, A’strelata, Colinus, and Lagopus. Mr.
Ridgway has also in preparation a manual of North American birds for
the use of naturalists and sportsmen. Dr. Stejneger has in preparation
a monograph of the birds of Japan, for use in the preparation of which
the Japanese Government has sent out a large number of specimens.

Another important research completed during the year was that by
Professor Ferrari-Perez, of the Geographical Exploring Expedition of
Mexico, upon the birds of Mexico, the entire collection of birds among
the national collections having been brought to Washington for deter-
mination and comparison, and his paper being based upon the studies
of the two national collections.

The number of specimens in the collection is now 59,945, 7,000 of
which have been set apart for the exhibition series. The universal ery
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Al

for more space is especially loud from the ornithologists, who might
readily fill it with material suitable for exhibition.

V (B). Department of Oology.—The collection of eggs and nests of
birds has been under the honorary curatorship of Capt. Charles BE.
Bendire, U. 8. Army, and very much has been accomplished during the
year in its classification and arrangement. The total number of speci-
mens added is 2,556 in 253 lots, and there are now more than 44,000 speci-
mens in the collection, of which 1,491 are in the exhibition and 31,124
in the reserve collection, the remainder having been set aside as dupli-
cates. The most important accession of the year was obtained in ex-
change from Capt. B. I’. Goss, of Pewaukee, Wis., 641 specimens, 111
species. Captain Bendire has continued his own gifts to the Museum.
Another important accession is the collection obtained by the Albatross
in the Bahamas in 1886. The oological collections are arranged in an
inconvenient apartment in the Museum, and, if space allowed, should
be assigned an apartment at least twice as large, in proximity to the
ornithological collections.

VI. Department of Reptiles.—The department has continued under the
honorary curatorship of Dr. H.C. Yarrow. The collections are massed
together in a small basement room, and a series of painted casts of the
largest species of snakes and turtles of North America is the only por-
tion of the collection displayed to the public. This collection is ex-
ceedingly rich, nearly every species of North American reptiles and batra-
chians being included, and the total number of specimens being estimated
at 25,334, An exhibition series of 750 specimens has been selected, but
there is no room for its display. During the year Prof. E. D. Cope, of
Philadelphia, who has been occupied, under the direction of the Smith-
sonian Institution, in the preparation of a report upon the reptiles of
North America, has completed the identification of the Museum collee-
tion of batrachians, and has identified and described in Museum pub-
lications collections made by the various correspondents of the Museum
in Mexico and Central and South America.

VII. Department of Fishes.—In no department of the Museum perhaps
is there so great a discrepancy between the extent of the collections
and the amount of space available for their administration, and the
progress toward an ideally satisfactory arrangement is therefore greatly
retarded. Good progress has been made during the year, however, and
the curator, Dr. T. H. Bean, reports that ail the material under his charge,
except recent collections made by the U.S. Fish Commission in the
deep-sea regions of the Atlantic, has been catalogued, the total number
of entries at the end of the year being 37,893, of which 662 have been
made during the year. The work of preparing illustrations of the most
important of the American species has been carried forward by the eura-
tor, and drawings of 78 species have been made.
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The card catalogue of the reserved series, which has been in prep-
aration for several years, has now been completed, and this card-cata-
logue, it is needless to say, proves to be invaluable as an aid to speedy
access to the specimens, as well as being areadily available systematic
index to the entire collection.

A large amount of duplicate material, including at least 15,000 speci-
mens, has been set aside for distribution, and is ready for exchange or
distribution as soon as time can be spared to separate it into lots and
packages.

The entire collection has been overhauled and put in the best possible
condition. An idea of its extent may be given by the fact that in order
to fill up bottles that have become partly empty by evaporation and
replace the alcohol, which had become unfit for use, twenty-five barrels
of alcohol were required.

The bulk of the larger specimens is still necessarily kept in copper
tanks; but everything that could be conveniently transferred to glass
has been placed in jars during the year, thus securing greater accessi-
bility and safety from destruction.

Heavy drafts have been made upon the time of the curator through
his occupation as editor of the publications of the Museum, and it is
hoped for the good of the Department that he may be relieved of this
extra service. He has, however, carried on the customary amount of
special research, having identified and reported upon a collection of
fishes from Jamaica, forwarded by the public museum of that colony;
on a collection of fishes from Alaska, sent in by Lieut. Commander H.
E. Nichols, U.S. Navy, besides a collection of fishes from Central Mexico
sent in by Professor Dugés.

Much of the research work of the curator has, however, in connec-
tion with Mr. Goode, been directed towards the preparation of a report
upon the extensive deep-sea collections of the U. 8. Fish Commission,
and those obtained by Mr. Alexander Agassiz in connection with the
work of the U. S. Coast Survey.

The work of this department was, during the months of August and
September, 1885, transferred to the Fish Commission headquarters at
Wood’s Holl, where all the deep-sea collections were concentrated, over-

hauled, classified, and catalogued, and systematic investigations carried —

on—a portion of the results of which has already been made public, and

the remainder of which it is hoped will soon appear in a monograph of —

the deep-sea fish fauna of the Eastern Atlantic, which has been for
some years in preparation.

The ease with which this extensive collection was handled in the large
rooms which were available for the purpose at Wood’s Holl, offers an
illustration of the great need for the better accommodation of the
fish collection in Washington. Work was finished in a few weeks at

Wood’s Holl which it would have required four or five months to have 4

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

accomplished in the cramped work-rooms in Washington. The collec-
tions which under these more favorable conditions had been overhauled,
identified, properly catalogued, and arranged were returned to Wash-
ington in October and November, and replaced upon the shelves in sys-
tematic order, where they. are now being worked up as rapidly as pos-
sible.

IX. Department of Mollusks.—The department of mollusks under tne
curatorship of Mr. W. H. Dall and Mr. R. E. C. Stearns, has made ex-
tensive progress during the year, especially in -he matter of catalogu-
ing and arranging the accumulations of past years. The amount of
work accomplished is well shown by the number of catalogue entries,
which is 18,638, representing between fifty and sixty thousand individ-
ual specimens. Only throe times as many entries were made in the
catalogue of this department during the preceding twenty years. The
number of entries does not represent the accessions of the year which
contained, however, much that was valuable and interesting. The clas.
sification and systematic arrangement of the accessions of previous
years, especially the Jeffreys collection and the Stearns collection, have
made extensive demands upon the attention of the staff. It may fairly
be said that there never has been an exhibition collection of mollusks,
although many years ago a few cases of shells were incidentally dis-
played. A beginning has been made by the curator in the work of de-
veloping this collection, and one experimental case containing the chief
types of cephalopods, pearls and pearl formations, cameo shells, and
sections showing the internal structure of various large and ornamen-
tal species, has been placed on exhibition. A provisional display is also
made of the principal economic mollusks of North America. There is,
however, no space available for exhibition of molluscan collections, and
the laboratory rooms are inadequate and inconvenient, so that even the
task of making the collections available for the use of students is much
more difficult than it should be, and what is being done may be looked
upon as preparatory to the occupation of more suitable apartments
when such shall have been provided.

The main features of the work of the year may be stated as follows:
The identification of specimens for teachers and others in various parts
of the United States; the identification and classification of the recent
or living mollusks of the Atlantic coast of North America, as well as
those of the Antillean-Caribbean region, in order to facilitate compari-
son and investigation of the later fossils with related living forms; the
arrangement of land, pond and fluviatile gastropods, as well as the
fresh-water acephala for the purposes of comparison and investigation
in the matter of geographical distribution and variation of species as
related to and affected by environment and environmental conditions.

The foregoing, as a whole, bears directly or indirectly upon the
geological phenomena and physical conditions, present and past, of the
continent of North America, &e., and the connection of the latter with
7 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the Asiatic and Huropean continents. Ultimately by means of the am-
ple collection of Jeffreys in Great Britain and Northern Europe, of Dall
in Alaska and the North Pacific, of Stearns’ West American and gen-
eral collection, and the accumulations of molluscan forms received from
the U. 8. Fish Commission, the student will be enabled to pursue the
biological history and connections of the two great oceans which bound
the North American continent, as well as the opposite regions of Eu-
rope and Asia.

Among the most important investigations in progress is that of Mr.
Dall upon the deep-sea mollusks, and his studies upon the Quaternary
molluscan fauna of the United States, and the continuation of previous
investigations by Mr. Stearns on the geographical’ distribution of the
land and fresh-water mollusks of North America and the variation of
the same, as related to and affected by the physical characters of their
environment.

X. Department of Entomology.—Although the department of insects
in the National Museum was organized three years ago, little has hitherto
been attempted beyond the care-taking necessary for the preservation
of the material already on hand; the honorary (or unpaid) curator of
the department, Dr. C. V. Riley, having had comparatively little aid
from the Museum appropriation in the matter of construction of cases
or the employment of assistants. At the beginning of the present
fiscal year a salaried assistant-curatorship was established, to which

Mr. John B. Smith was appointed. Additional accommodations in the.

laboratory and exhibition hall had been provided, and the study-col-
lections and the exhibition series are now being rapidly extended.

In October, Dr. C. V. Riley formally presented to the Museum his
private collection of North American insects, representing the fruits of
his own labors in collecting and study for over twenty-five years. This
collection contains over 115,000 pinned specimens, and much additional
material unpinned and in alcohol.

This generous gift to the Government has long been contemplated by

Dr. Riley, whose ambition it is to be, so far as possible, instrumental

in forming a national collection of insects, and who is satisfied that his
collection will form an excellent nucleus for future accumulations. In
his letter of presentation he remarks:

._‘“ While the future of any institution dependent on Congressional
support may not be so certain as that of one supported by endowment,
I make this donation in the firm belief and full confidence that the Na-
tional Museum is already so well established in public estimation that
it must inevitably grow until it shall rival and ultimately surpass other
institutions in this country, or the world, as a repository of natural-
history collections.

“If there shall in the future result the concentration here at the na-
tional capital of the extensive entomological material which naturally
comes here, and which in the past has been scattered among specialists
in all parts of the country, so that in the future the student may find

Zee ee
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

valuable material to further his work in any order, I shall feel amply
rewarded for the action I have taken.”

A recent census of the national collection of insects has been taken,
the results of which are published in the curator’s report for the year.

XI. Department of Marine Invertebrates —The U. 8. Fish Commis-
sion has continued to be the principal contributor to this department,
which is in charge of Mr. Richard Rathbun. The steamer Albatross
remained in active service during the most of the year, making explora-
tions along the entire eastern coast of North America, from the Grand
Bank of Newfoundland to Southern Florida and the Bahamas. <A large
part of the region visited, and especially the important fishing banks
located off the coast*of the British provinces and the deep-water areas
about the Bahama Reefs, had never been systematically investigated
before, and the biological results were, therefore, of the greatest value.
Over two hundred and fifty successful hauls were made with the dredge,
beam trawl, and tangles, the deepest cast having been in 2,731 fathoms,
or considerably over 3 miles. The amount of material obtained was
very large, and many of the groups of marine invertebrates are now in
the hands of specialists for study. Important contributions were also
received from other sources: notably a fine series of deep-sea soundings
from the southern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, made by the U.S. 8S.
Enterprise, and large collections from the Western and Northwestern
coasts off America and Siberia. One of the most interesting accessions
consists of microscopical preparations of nearly two hundred species
of British sponges, mainly described or identified by the late Doctor
Bowerbank, and supplied by Canon A. M. Norman, a distinguished
English naturalist, to whom the Museum was previously indebted for
important exchanges.

The west hall of the Smithsonian Institution, which has served as a
work-room for this department during most of the past three years, has
been permanently opened to the public, although no considerable
changes have recently been made in the arrangement of the display
collections. The northwest gallery of the main hall is now used for the
storage and examination of the dried specimens of marine invertebrates,
and an additional large store-room has been fitted up in the basement
for alcoholic collections which have had an unparalleled growth.during
the past few years. The work of identifying the collection of Echini
has been completed, and that group is now conveniently arranged for
reference and study. It contains 152 species, many of which are repre-
sented by extensive series of specimens covering a wide range of distri-
bution. A list of all the specimens has been prepared for publication.
The Hon. Theodore Lyman has continued his work upon the collection
of Ophiurans belonging to the Museum, and is now engaged in study-
ing the specimens obtained by the steamer Albatross south of Cape
Hatteras, and those from the western coast of North America, includ-
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ing Alaska. Prof. A. E. Verrill, Prof. 8. I. Smith, and several other
naturalists are still engaged as collaborators upon Fish Commission
collections, some of which have been transferred to the Museum during
the past year, while others are expected at an early date. Large num-
bers of duplicate specimens have been distributed to institutions of
learning throughout the country.

XII. Department of Comparative Anatomy.—The work in this depart-
ment, of which Mr. F. W. True is curator, is at present confined toa
development of the osteological collection which is already of consider-
able dimensions and occupies one of the entire exhibition halls. The addi-
tions to this department have been comparatively few, the steady in-
crease in the exhibition series of material being the result of cleaning and
mounting skeletons which had come into the Museum in previous years.

Attention has been directed especially to obtaining skeletons of thor-
oughbred domestic animals, and a considerable number of specimens
representing the important breeds of dogs, have been obtained during
the year. In this series a single case is devoted to the comparison of
the vertebrae of the different. groups of vertebrates. Of the cervical
vertebre a considerable number of typical forms have been placed side
by side; in another series the dorsal, in another the caudal vertebra.
Another part of the series shows the limbs of the vertebrates arranged
so that their parts can be readily compared. In still another case is ex-
hibited the structure of bones and the teeth, and so on through the en-
tire structure of the skeleton.

A card catalogue of the skeletons of the mammals, which constitute
the greater bulk of the collection, has been completed. fs

XIII. Department of Invertebrate Possils—(A) Paleozoie Section.—Mr.
C. D. Walcott, of the Geological Survey, honorary curator, reports that
the collection now contains over 80,000 specimens, of which 7,833 have
been added during the year, a large portion of this material having
been transferred from the Geological Survey. The collection has been
personally arranged by him during the two years of his connection with
the Museum, and is now contained in sixteen table-cases in one of the
principal halls of the Museum. Nothing has yet been exhibited, but as
soon as cases shall have been provided, a very interesting series already
selected may be placed upon view. Mr. Walcott’s attention is at present
especially directed to the formation of a systematic collection of the
Cambrian fossils of the United States, as well as for securing a study
collection from typical localities in the Lower Silurian and Devonian
formations.

The special research upon which Mr. Walcott is engaged in behalf of
the Geological Survey is the study of the stratigraphy and paleontology
of the Cambrian system of North America. During the past year the
results of a preliminary study of the Middle Cambrian was published
as Bulletin 30 of the U. S. Geological Survey.

(B) Mesozoic Section.—Dr. C. A. White, of the U.S. Geological Survey,
honorary curator, reports a total of 1,563 entries in the catalogue dur-
ing the year. The principal additions are those which have been sent
by the U.S. Geological Survey. The work of arranging and classify-
ing the collections has progressed steadily, and they are now accessible
for purposes of study. The provisional arrangement is purely strati-
graphical, only a broad biological classification having been attempted
under each geological period. The type specimens have been re-identi.
fied by Mr. J. B. Marcou, who has published a catalogue of the same
in the Proceedings of the Museum.*

(C) Cenozoic Section.—This department, organized since the change of
Mr. Dall from the Coast Survey to the Geological Survey, in which he
is officially serving as paleontologist in charge of the later formations,
is practically incorporated with the department of mollusks.

XIV and XV. Departments of Fossil and Recent Plants.—The botanical
collections are under the honorary curatorship of Prof. Lester F. Ward,
of the U.S. Geological Survey, and Mr. F. H. Knowlton, one of the assist-
ants of the Museum. The attention of thé curator is chiefly directed
toward the study of the fossil plants, a subject upon which he is now
the principal American authority. His sketch of the history and pres-
ent condition of fossil botany, published during the year as one of the
bulletins of the Geological Survey, gives an excellent idea of the char-
acter of the work he has undertaken to accomplish in connection with
the national collections. The number of specimens added during the
year has not been great, attention having been chiefly concentrated
upon the preliminary work of classification and arrangement. The
herbarium of recent plants contains now not less than 30,000 specimens.
The largest and most valuable accessions during the year were the col-
lections from Texas and the adjacent States and Territories, gift of
Dr. V. Havard, U.S. Army, the types of his paper upon “the Flora of
Texas,” published in the Proceedings of the Museum. An important
piece of routine work accomplished has been the completion of the card-
catalogue of the Joad collection of Old World plants, recently acquired
from the Botanical Gardens at Kew, through the Harvard Herbarium.
This collection contains about 10,000 species, 9,000 of which were new
to the herbarium. The card-catalogue system, as applied to the arrange-
ment of the American herbarium, has proved to be of great practical
value, since it renders it possible to ascertain the presence or absence
of any species without going through cases.

‘‘ This,” remarks the curator, “is believed to be the only large her-
barium in this country in which this system has been adopted, and the
labor of keeping it up will be very slight compared with what it would
be to prepare such a catalogue after the accumulation of a great mass
of material. No species is considered as belonging to the collection

* Vol. VILL, pp. 290-344.
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

until its card has first been written and entered. Besides convenience

‘of consultation, this system possesses another point of advantage in
that it furnishes the source of a record, easily accessible, of the exact
status and magnitude of the collections, a matter which is oper to much
speculation when no such data are at hand.

‘The poisoning of specimens newly received has occupied much time.
About 5,000 specimens have been permanently protected from the ray-
ages of insects. A complete immersion of the specimens in a saturated
alcoholic solution of strychnine has been found most efficacious.

“The work which has required the largest ameunt of time has been
the selection of material for mounting. Instead of mounting indiscrimi-
nately the mass of duplicate material which constantly comes to a col-
lection of this character, a careful comparison is always made in order
to be certain that the specimens will actually add to the ones already
in hand; either a different phase of the plant or a new and interesting
locality. In this manner pure duplication is checked and the growth
of the herbarium made to accommodate itself, as nearly as possible, to
the present somewhat restricted space. As rapidly as the specimens
selected can be mounted, they are added to their systematic place to
the herbarium, so that no large amount of this new material is allowed
to accumulate and remain inaccessible.”

XVI. Devartment of Minerals.—The department of minerals, so long
in a quiescent condition, is now making rapid progress under the diree-
tion of Prof. F. W. Clarke, of tbe U. 8S. Geological Survey, who is its
honorary curator, assisted by Mr. W. 8S. Yeates. An extensive system
of exchanges has been carried on during the year with private collectors
and with a number of public museums, among which may be mentioned
the Ecole des Mines in Paris, the museum at Annecy in Savoy, the Uni-
versity of Sydney, Australia, and Amherst College, Massachusetts, and
an unusual number of gifts have been received from individuals and
institutions.

The total increase in the number of specimens during the year has
been nearly 800. The number of specimens in the collection, including
duplicates, is 18,401, about 4,500 of which are on exhibition. The exhibi-
tion space of the department is already overcrowded and the collection
for public display cannot be increased until more cases can be provided.
Much has been accomplished, however, in the improvement of the ar-
rangement of both study and exhibition series, and the classification is
more perfect than before. The collection of gems and ornamental stones
has received its fuli share of attention, and a description of this will be
printed in the Museum report during the coming year. Special atten-
tion has been given to the enlargement of the meteorite collection. The
proper growth of this collection is greatly impeded, perhaps more so
than any other, by a lack of funds for the purchase of valuable speci-
mens which now invariably fall into the hands of dealers and foreign
museums.

|
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

The scientific work upon the collection has been mostly done in con-
nection with the work of the Geological Survey. Professor Clarke is en-
gaged in an investigation of the chemical structure of the silicates, and
there are also in progress in his laboratory in the Museum building a
revision of the borates and a full series of analyses of the mineral tour-
maline.

XVII. Department of Lithology and Physical Geology.—The increase of
the department, though not so large as in the previous years, has been
healthy and symmetrical. Among the more important accessions may
be mentioned a collection of rocks and building stones of Mexico, ob-
tained by exchange from the Mexican Geographical Exploring Expedi-
tion; a series of the rocks of continental Europe, obtained by exchange
from the museum at Annecy, Savoy; a series of typical marbles from
Pickens County, Georgia, gift of the Georgia Marble Company, and a
series of building stones obtained from the State commissioner of South
Carolina at the New Orleans Exposition, and a vertical column repre-
senting the proportional thickness of the Archean, Cambrian, and Silu-
rian rocks of New Hampshire, obtained by exchange from Prof. C. H.
Hitchcock.

The exhibition series has continued to increase, and all the available
cases are already filled, and much material ready for display as soon as
others are constructed. The time of the curator and his assistant has
been fully occupied in the development of the exhibition series, in the
preparation of copy for labels, and in the completion of classification of
the study series. A number of beautiful and instructive relief maps,
placed in the Museum by the U. S. Geological Survey, have been pro-
vided with cases and put on exhibition. Chief among these are the
models of Mount Taylor, New Mexico; Washoe District, Nevada; Eu-
reka District, Nevada; Uinta and Wasatch Mountains, Utah; Lead-
ville and vicinity, Colorado; the same in sections; High Plateaus of
Utah; Henry Mountains, Utah; stereogram of the Henry Mountains,
Utah; Elk Mountains, Colorado; Yosemite Valley, California, and the
Yellowstone National Park. Of the various exhibition series in process
of preparation, the collections of rock-forming minerals, the structural
series, lithological series, and the building and ornamental stones only
are in conditicn approximating completion. Others, now under way,
though in a less advanced stage, are the three series classed under the
head of dynamical, structural, and historical geology. <A portion of the
materials belonging to these series are already on exhibition, being of
themselves sufficiently striking in appearance to excite interest, though
not occupying their proper places in the systematic collection.

The investigations of the curator, Mr. G. P. Merrill, have been directed
chiefly toward the mineralogy of the District of Columbia, the origin and
nature of fulgurites, the durability of building stones, besides studies on
local petrograpy which are not yet ready for publication. The curator

H. Mis. 170 4

50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

has also prepared a catalogue of the building stone collection now in the
Museum, which will be published in the Museum report for the coming
year. He has also in preparation a general work on economic petrog-
raphy for the use of students, quarrymen, architects, and builders.
The curator calls especial attention to the desirability of allowing the
head of the department annually a certain sum of money to be ex-
pended in filling gaps in the exhibition series.

The total number of rock specimens in the collection is given as
20,647, 17,647 of which belong to the reserve series. Of the latter
number, 5,313 are on exhibition, 2,730 of which are building and orna-
mental stones, and 1,829 belong to the educational series and rock-
forming minerals.

XVIII. Department of Metallurgy and Economic Geology.—The atten-
tion of Prof. F. P. Dewey, curator of this department, has been devoted
to classifying and arranging the mass of unassorted material which has
been referred to in previous reports, especially the material received
from the Institute of Mining Engineers, part of which was received
during the year. It has not been the policy of the department to solicit
accessions, owing to the fact that there is so much material already on
hand which, owing to the lack of space, it has been impossible to bring
under control. During the year work upon the preparation of the ex-
hibition series has gone steadily forward, and as soon as the exhibition
cases shall have been provided a large amount of material can be dis-
played. A preliminary display has been made of a portion of this collec-
tion, especially the systematic collection, the beginnings of which were
exhibited at New Orleans. This material exhibited at New Orleans
was intended to illustrate (1) the geological distribution of the ores of
the United States and (2) the processes used in the extraction of the
metals from the ores. A descriptive catalogue of the systematic col-
lections has been prepared by the curator for publication in the Mu-
seum report during the coming year as a guide for visitors and as a
foundation for future collections.

The curator has for three years been engaged upon the investigation
of the physical properties of coke, and has already published a paper
upon the porosity and specific gravity of different kinds of coke. In
the prosecution of this work the department is aided by Maj. Jed.
Hotchkiss, who has provided necessary apparatus. In connection with
this work especial attention has been paid to the devolopment of the
Museum collection of the cokes of the world, which is already of con-
sidrable extent and constantly increasing.

The curator called attention to the especial need of the Museum for

these collections of a scientific and technological character, it is desira-
ble to illustrate in the Museum the condition of miners and their modes
of life. This has already been done for the anthracite coal miners of
Pennsylvania, and the screens of photographs, instruments, and clothing
already on exhibition are of great interest. We hope that similar collee-
tions may be obtained in connection with other kinds of miners.
The total number of specimens in the collection is estimated at 48,000,
of which 17,000 are on exhibition. During the year 5,506 entries, in-

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

The prosecution of ethnologic researches among the North American
Indians, under the Smithsonian Institution and in compliance with law
was continued during the fiscal year 1885~86 under the charge of Maj.
J. W. Powell, who, as Director of the Bureau of Ethnology, has fur-
nished the following account of its operations:

_ The account of the work for the six months ending June 30, 1885, as
published in the report of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
for that period, being meager, for the reasons therein stated, some por-
tions of the operations in the latter part of the year 1884~85 are now
ineluded to preserve continuity.

The report may be conveniently divided into the two general heads
of Field Work and Office Work, the latter to a large extent being the
supplement to, and discussion of, the former, and executed by the same
officers who had previously obtained materials and information in the
field.

I. FIELD WORK.

This heading may be divided into: first, Mound Explorations; second,
Explorations in Ancient and Modern Stone Villages; and, third, General
Field Studies, embracing those in institutions, linguistics, and other
divisions of anthropology.

Mound Explorations—The work of the mound exploring division,
under the charge of Prof. Cyrus Thomas, was carried on during the
year with the same success reported for former years.

Messrs. James D. Middleton, John P. Rogan, and John W. Emmert
were engaged during the year as regular assistants; Mr. Charles M.
Smith, Rev. 8. D. Peet, and Mr. H. L. Reynolds were also employed for
short periods as temporary assistants.

At the commencement of the year Messrs. Middleton and Emmert
were at work on the mounds and ancient monuments of Southwestern
Wisconsin, where they remained until cold weather set in, when they
were transferred to Kast Tennessee, where Mr. Emmert continued at
work throughout the remainder of the year,
5? REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

It was deemed advisable to commence the preparation of a complete
report of the work of the division, with a view of having it ready for
publication by the close of the fiscal year ending June 30, 1887. Mr.
Middleton was called to the office, where he remained, preparing maps
and plats and cataloguing the collections, until the latter part of April,
1886, when he again entered upon field work in the southern part of
Illinois.

Mr. Rogan was in charge of the office from the 1st of July to the
middle of August, Professor Thomas being in the field during that time.
He was engaged the remainder of the year in exploring the mounds of
Northern Georgia and Kast Tennessee.

Rey. S. D. Peet was employed for a few months preparing a prelim-
inary map showing the localities of the antiquities of Wisconsin and
the areas formerly occupied by the different Indian tribes which are
known to have inhabited that region. In addition he prepared for use
in the report notes on the distribution and character of the mound and
other ancient works of Wisconsin.

Mr. Smith was engaged during the month of Junein exploring mounds
in Southwestern Pennsylvania; and Mr. Reynolds during the same time
in tracing and exploring the monuments of Western New York. The
amount of field work done was substantially the same as in previous
years. About 5,500 specimens were obtained, all of which, collected
before June 30, 1886, have been numbered, catalogued, and turned over
to the National Museum.

Explorations in Ancient and Modern Stone Villages—During the sum-
mer the Director, accompanied by Mr. James Stevenson, revisited por-
tions of Arizona and New Mexicoin which many structures are found
which have greatly interested travelers and anthropologists, and about
which various theories have grown. The results of the investigation
have been so much more distinct and comprehensive than any before
obtained that they require mention.

On the plain to the west of the Colorado River and north of the San
Francisco Mountain there are many scattered ruins, usually having one,
two, or three rooms each, all of which are built of basaltic cinders and
blocks. Through the plain a valley runs to the north, and then east to
the Little Colorado. Down the midst of the valley there is a wash,
through which, in seasons of great rainfall, a stream courses. Along
this stream there are extensive ruins built of sandstone and limestone.
At one place a village site was discovered, in which several hundred peo-

ple once found shelter. To the north of this and about 25 miles from the ~

summit of San Francisco Peak, there is a voleanic cone of cinder and
basalt. This small cone had been used as the site of a village, a pueblo
having been built around the crater. The materials of construction were
derived from a great sandstone quarry near by, and the pit from which
they were taken was many feet in depth and extended over 2 or 3 acres
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

of ground. The cone rises on the west in a precipitous cliff from the
valley of an intermittent creek. The pueblo was built on that side
at the summit of the cliff, and extending on the north and south sides
along the summit of steep slopes, was inclosed on the east, so that
' the plaza was entered by a covered way. The court, or plaza, was about
one-third of an acre in area. The little pueblo contained perhaps sixty
or seventy rooms. Southward of San Francisco Mountain many other
ruins were found.
Hast of the San Francisco Peak, at a distance of about 12 miles, an-
other cinder cone was found. Here the cinders are softand friable, and
_ the cone isa prettily shaped dome. On the southern slope there are exea-
vations into the indurated and coherent cinder mass, constituting cham-
bers, often 10 or 12 feet in diameter and 6 to 10 feet in height. The
chambers are of irregular shape, and occasionally a larger central cham-
_ ber forms a kind of vestibule to several smaller ones gathered about it.
The smaller chambers are sometimes at the same altitude as the central
or principal one, and sometimes ata lower altitude. About one hundred
and fifty of these chambers have been excavated. Most of them are now
partly filled by the caving in of the walis and ceilings, but some of them
are yet in a good state of preservation. In these chambers, and about
them on the summit and sides of the cinder cone, many stone implements
were found, especially metates.. Some bone implements also were dis-
covered. At the very summit of the little cone there is a plaza, inclosed
by a rude wall made of volcanic cinders, the floor of which was eare-
fully levelled. The plaza is about 45 by 75 feet in area. Here the
people lived in underground houses—chambers hewn from the friable
voleanic cinders. Before them, to the south, west, and north stretched
beautiful valleys, bevond which volcanic cones are seen rising amid pine
forests. The people probably cultivated patches of ground in the low
valleys.
About 18 miles still farther to the east of San Francisco Mountain
another ruined village was discovered, built about the crater of a vol-
_canie cone. This voleanic peak is of much greater magnitude. The
_erater opens to the eastward. On the south many stone dwellings have
been built of the basaltic and cinder-like rocks. Between the ridge on
the south and another on the northwest there is a low saddle in which
other buildings have been erected, and in which a great plaza was
found, much like the one previously described. But the most interest-
ing part of this village was on the cliff which rose on the northwest side
of the crater. In this cliff are many natural caves, and the caves
themselves were utilized as dwellings by inclosing them in front with
walls made of voleanic rocks and cinders. These cliff dwellings are
placed tier above tier, in a very irregular way. In many cases natural
caves were thus utilized; in other cases cavate chambers were made ;
that is, chambers have been excavated in the friable cinders. On the
very summit of the ridge stone buildings were erected, so that this vil-

lage was in part a cliff village, in part cavate, and in part the ordinary |
stone pueblo. The valley below, especially to ‘aie southward, was prob-—
ably occupied by their gardens. In the chambers among the overhang-
ing cliffs a great many interesting relics were found of stone, bone, and
wood, and many potsherds. ;

About 8 miles southeast of Flagstaff, a little town on the southern
slope of San Francisco Mountain, Oak Creek enters a cafion, which
runs to the eastward and then southward for a distance of about 10
miles. The gorge is a precipitous box cafion for the greater part of this
distance. It is eut through carboniferous rocks—sandstones and lime-
stones—which are here nearly horizontal. The softer sandstones rap-
idly disintegrate, and the harder sandstones and limestones remain.
Thus broad shelves are formed on the sides of the cliffs, and these
shelves, or the deep recesses between them were utilized, so that here is
a village of cliff dwellings. There are several hundred rooms alto-
gether. The rooms are of sandstone, pretty carefully worked and laid
in mortar, and the interior of the rooms was plastered. The opening
for the chimney was usually by the side of the entrance, and the ceil-
ings of the rooms are still blackened with soot and smoke. Around
this village, on the terrace of the caiion, great numbers of potsherds,
stone implements, and implements of bone, horn, and wood were found;
and here, as in all of the other ruins mentioned, corncobs in great
abundance were discovered.

In addition to the four principal ruins thus Asad many others are
found—most of them being of the ordinary pueblo type. From the
evidence presented it would seem that they had all been occupied at a
comparatively late date. They were certainly not abandoned more than
three or four centuries ago.

Later in the season the Director visited the Supai Indians of Cata-
ract Cafion, and was informed by them that their present home had
been taken up not many generations ago, and that their ancestors
occupied the ruins which have been described; and they gave such a
circumstantial account of the occupation and of their expulsion by the
Spaniards, that no doubt can be entertained of the truth of their tradi-
tions in this respect. The Indians of Cataract Cation doubtless lived
on the north, east, and south of San Francisco Mountain at the time
this country was discovered by the Spaniards, and they subsequently
left their cliff and cavate dwellings, and moved into Cataract Cation,
where they now live. Itis thus seen that these cliff and cavate dwellings
are not of an ancient, prehistoric time, but that they were occupied by
a people still existing, who also built pueblos of the common type.

Later in the season the party visited the cavate ruins near Santa Clara,
previously explored by Mr. Stevenson. Here, on the western side of
the Rio Grande del Norte, were found a system of volcanic peaks, con-
stituting what is known as the Valley Range. To the east of these
peaks, stretching far beyond the present channel of the Rio Grande,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. BH

there was once a great Tertiary lake, which was gradually filled with
the sands washed into it on every hand and by the ashes blown out of
the adjacent voleanoes. This great lake formation is in some places a
thousand feet in thickness. When the lake was filled, the Rio Grande
cut its channel through the midst to a depth of many hundreds of feet.
The volcanic mountains to the westward send to the Rio Grande a
number of minor streams, which in a general way are parallel with one
another. The Rio Grande itself and all of these lateral streams have
cut deep gorges and canons, so that there are long, irregular table-lands,
or mesas, extending from the Rio Grande back to the Valley Mountains,
each mesa being severed from the adjacent one by a cafion or canon
valley; and each of these long mesas rises with a precipitous cliff from
the valley below. The cliffs themselves are built of voleanice sands and
ashes, and many of the strata are exceedingly light and friable. The
specific gravity of some of these rocks is so low that they will float on
water. Into the faces of these cliffs, in the friable and easily-worked
rock, many chambers have been excavated; for mile after mile the cliffs
are studded with them, so that altogether there are many thousands.
Sometimes a chamber or series of chambers is entered from a terrace,
but usually they were excavated many feet above any landing or ter-
races below, so that they could be reached only by ladders. In other
places artificial terraces were built by constructing retaining-walis and
filling the interior next to the cliff with loose rock and sand. Very often
steps were cut into the face of a cliff and a rude stairway formed by
which chambers could be reached. The chambers were very irregularly
arranged and very irregular in size and structure. In many cases there
is a central chamber which seems to have been a general living-room
for the people, and back of which two, three, or more chambers somewhat
smaller are found. The chambers occupied by one family are some-
times connected with those occupied by another family, so that two or
three or four sets of chambers have interior communication.

Usually, however, the communication from one system of chambers to
another was by the outside. Many of the chambers had evidently been
occupied as dwellings. They still contained fire-places and evidences
of fire; there were little caverns or shelves in which various vessels
were placed, and many evidences of the handicraft of the people were
left in stone, bone, horn, and wood, and in the chambers and about the
sides of the cliffs potsherds are abundant. On more eareful survey it
was found that many chambers had been used as stables for asses,
goats, and sheep. Sometimes they had been filled a few inches, or even
two or three feet with the excrement of these animals. Ears of corn
and corn-cobs were also found in many places. Some of the chambers
were evidently constructed to be used as storehouses or caches for grain.
Altogether it is very evident that the cliff houses have been used in
comparatively modern-times, at any rate since the people owned asses,
goats, and sheep. The rock is of such a friable nature that it will not
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

stand atmospheric degradation very long, and there is abundant evi-
dence of this character testifying to the recent occupancy of these
eavate dwellings. Above the cliffs, on the mesas which have already
been described, evidences of more ancient ruins were found. These
were pueblos built of cut stone rudely dressed. Every mesa had at
least one ancient pueblo upon it, evidently far more ancient than the
cavate dwellings found in the face of the cliffs. It is then very plain
that the cavate dwellings are not of great age; that they have been
occupied since the advent of the white man, and that on the summit of
the cliffs there are ruins of more ancient pueblos. Now, the pottery of
Santa Clara had been previously studied by Mr. Stevenson, who made
a large collection there two or three years ago, and it was at once no-
ticed that the potsherds of these cliff dwellings are, both in shape and
material, like those now made by the Santa Clara Indians. The pecu-
liar pottery of Santa Clara is readily distinguisbed, as may be seen by
examining the collection now in the National Museum. While encamped
in the valley below, the party met a Santa Clara Indian, and engaged
him in conversation. From him the history of the cliff dwellings was
soon discovered. His statement was that originally his people lived in
six pueblos, built of cut stone, upon the summit of the mesas; that
there came a time when they were at war with the Apaches and Nava-
jos, when they abandoned their stone pueblos above, and for greater
protection excavated the chambers in the cliffs below; that when this
war ended, part of them returned to the pueblos above, which were re-
built; that there afterward came another war, with the Comanche In-
dians, and they once more resorted to cliff dwellings. At the close of this
war they built a pueblo in the valley of the Rio Grande, but at the time
of the invasion of the Spaniards their people refused to be baptized,
and a Spanish army was sent against them, when they abandoned the
valley below and once more inhabited the cliff dwellings above. Here
they lived many years, until at last a wise and good priest breught
them peace, and persuaded them to build the pueblo which they now
occupy—the village of Santa Clara. The ruin of the pueblo, which
they occupied previous to the invasion of the Spaniards, is still to be
seen, about a mile distant from the present pueblo.

The history thus briefly given was repeated by the governor, and by
other persons, all substantially to the same effect. It is therefore
evident that the cavate dwellings of the Santa Clara region belong to
a people still extant; that they are not of great antiquity, and do nof,
give evidence of a prehistoric and now extinct race.

Plans and measurements were made of some of the villages with
sufficient accuracy to prepare models. Photographic views and sketches
were also procured, with which to illustrate a detailed report of the
subject, to be published by the Bureau.

After the investigations made in company with the Director, Mr.

Stevenson proceeded with a party to the Provinee of Tusayan, in Ari--

zona, to study the ethnologic characteristics of its inhabitants, and to
make collections of such implements and utensils as would illustrate
their arts and industries. Several months were spent among the vil-
lages, resulting in a large collection of rare objects, all of which were
selected with special reference to their anthropologic importance. This
collection contains many articles novel in character, and for different
uses from any heretofore obtained, all of which will form an important
addition to the collections in the National Museum.

A study of their religious ceremonials and mythologic beliefs was
made, of which full notes were taken. Sketches were made of their
masks and other objects which could not be obtained for the collection.

Mrs. Stevenson was also enabled to secure a minute description of the
celebrated dance, or medicine ceremony, of the Navajos, called the Yéi-
bit-cai. Mrs. Stevenson made complete sketches of the sand altars,
masks, and other objects employed in this ceremonial.

Mr. Victor Mindeleff, who has in past years been engaged in investi-
gating the architecture of the pueblos, and the ruins of the Southwest,
commenced work shortly before the beginning of the fiscal year. A
short visit was paid to the Moki villages, securing drawings of some
constructional details, and also traditions bearing on the ruins in that
vicinity. The main camp was established near Mashongnavi, one of
the Moki villages. A large ruined pueblo, formerly occupied by the
Mashongnavis, was here surveyed. Nostanding walls are found at the
present time, and many portions of the plan are entirely obliterated.
Typical fragments of pottery were collected.

Following this work, four other ruined pueblos were surveyed, and
such portions of them as clearly indicated dividing walls were drawn
on the ground-plans.

Many of the ruins in this vicinity, according to the traditions of the
Mokis, have been occupied in comparatively recent times—a number
of them having been abandoned since the Spanish conquest of the
country. In several cases the villages now occupied are not the same
as those first visited by the Spaniards, although probably retaining the
same names.

While the work of surveying was in progress, in charge of Mr. Cos-
mos Mindeleff, Mr. Victor Mindeleff made a visit of several days at
Keam’s Cation, there to meet a number of the Navajo Indians to ex-
plain the purpose of the work and allay the suspicions of these Indians,
a necessary precaution, as some of the proposed work was laid out in
Canon de Chelly, in the heart of their reservation. Recent restrictions
to which they had been subjected, as a consequence of new surveys of
the reservation line, had made them especially distrustful of parties of
Americans equipped with instruments for surveying. Incidental to such
explanations of the purpose of the work, an opportunity was afforded of
securing a number of mythologic notes, and also some interesting data
regarding the construction of their “ hogans,” with the rules preserib-
58 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ing the arrangement of each part of the frame, &c. A number of cere
monial songs are sung at the building of these houses, but of these
only one could be secured, this one, however, both in the original and
translated. Whenever opportunity occurred, during the progress of
the work, photographs and diagrams of construction of ‘ hogans ” were
secured.

On August 17, the ceremony of the snake-dance took place at Ma-
shongnavi, similar in every detail to that performed at Wolpi, and dif-
fering only in the number of participants. A number of instantaneous
negatives of the various phases of the dance were secured. On August
18, the following day, the same ceremony was performed at Wolpi,
the easternmost of the Moki villages, on a larger scale.

While the surveys of the ruins were in progress many detailed stud-
ies of special features were made in the modern villages, particularly
among the “ kivas,” or religious chambers. In several instances the
large roofing timbers of the “ kiva” were found to be the old beams from
the Spanish churches, hewn square, and decorated with the character-
istic rude carving of the old Spanish work. A number of legends, con- —
nected with the ruined pueblos, were recorded.

On closing this work in the vicinity of the Moki villages, late in Au- ~
gust, the party moved into Keam’s Canon, en route for Caton de Chelly: |

A day was devoted to the survey of a small pueblo of irregular ellipti-
cal outline, situated about 15 miles northeast from Keam’s Caiion. This
ruin is in an excellent state of preservation and exhibits in the ma-
sonry some stones of remarkably large size. The early part of Septem-
ber was employed in making a close survey*of the Mummy Cave group
of ruins in Cation dela Muerte, this work including a 5-foot contour
map of the ground and the rocky ledge over which the houses were dis- _
tributed. Detailed drawings of a number of special features were here
made, particularly in connection with the circular ceremonial chambers.
The latter were so buried under the accumulated débris of fallen walls
that much excavation was required to lay bare the details of internal —
arrangement. <A high class of workmanship is here exhibited, both in |
the execution of the constructional features and in the interior decora-
tion of these chambers. Later the White House group in the Caiion |
de Chelly, comprising a village and cliff houses, was examined and |
platted in the same manner.

The drawings and plans were supplemented with a series of photo-
graphs. Some negatives of Navajo houses were also made.

On closing this work the party went into Fort Defiance, en route for
Zuni, and thence to Ojo Caliente, a modern farming pueblo of the
Zunis, about 12 miles south of the principal village. Here two ruins of
villages, thought to belong to the ancient Cibola group, were platted. —
One of these villages had been provided with a cireular reservoir of —
large size, partially walled in with masonry. Here, also, can be seen |

the well-preserved walls of a stone church. The other also contains
. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

the remains of a large church, built of adobe. A series of widely scat-
tered house clusters, occurring about 24 miles west of Ojo Caliente, was
also examined, but the earth had drifted over the fallen wails and so
covered them over that the arrangement of rooms could scarcely be*
traced at all.

The modern village of Ojo Caliente was also surveyed and diagrams
and photographs made.

Towards the end of September camp was moved to the vicinity of
Zuni. Here we examined four other villages of the Cibola group and
the old villages on the mesa of Ta-ai-ya-lo-ne. Camp was then moved
to Nutria, a farming pueblo of Zuni. From this camp Nutria was sur-
veyed and photographed, and also the village of Pescado; the latter
is occupied only during the farming season. Both of these modern
farming pueblos appear to be built on the ruins of more ancient villages,
the remains of which were especially noticeable in the case of Pescado,
where the very carefully executed masonry, characteristic of the ancient
methods of construction, could be seen outcropping at many points.

Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff was ordered to report at the Moki towns, Ari-
zona, for field duty, and left Washington July 6. He was placed in
charge of the surveying work necessary in the Stove Village region,
and his work is included in the general report of that division.

He assisted in collecting from the present inhabitants of the region
legendary information bearing upon the ruins and in observing the
snake-dance of the Moki Indians, a description of which was prepared
for publication.

Following the return of the main party to Washington some prelim-
inary exploration was carried on by Mr. E. W. Nelson, who made an
examination of the headwaters of the South Fork of Salt River, but did
not find any ruins. Thence the Blue Ridge was crossed and the valley

- of the Blue Fork of the San Francisco River visited. Here ruins were

plentiful, increasing in number towards the south. Farther south three
sets of cliff ruins were also located.

General field studies—Dr. Washington Matthews, assistant surgeon
U.S. Army, was stationed in the Navajo country as post surgeon of
Fort Wingate, N. Mex., from 1880 to 1884, during which time he de-
voted himself to studying the language, customs, &e., of this tribe as
much as his official duties would permit.

In the autumn of 1884 he was given an opportunity, under the aus-
pices of the Bureau of Ethnology, to return to the Navajo country and
devote himself for a considerable time entirely to the anthropologic
study of the people.

He first visited the Navajoes who dwell in the neighborhood of the
San Mateo Mountains, the Tsotsildine, or peopie of the Great Peak, a
local division or subtribe, living much farther to the east and having
longer and more intimate associations with Mexicans and Americans

¥4T

than the main body of the nation. While at this place he ascended
60 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ‘

the peak of San Mateo, or Mount Taylor—a mountain held sacred b v
the Navajos—to observe the various places on the mountain mentioned
in the Navajo myths.

Leaving San Mateo he proceeded to Fort Wingate, and, learning
that one of the most important of the Navajo rites was about to be
celebrated at a place called Nihotlize (Hard Earth), north of Fort
Wingate, on the Navajo Reservation, he repaired thither without delay.
The ceremony was that of Dsilyidje qatal, or “chant upon the mount- -
ains.” It is called Ilnasjingo qatal, or “chant in the dark circle of
branches,” from the great corral of evergreens, in which the public rites
of the last night are performed. It is known to the white men who
live among these Indians as the Hoshkaun dance, from one of the
public dances of the last night in which the Indian jugglers pretend to
grow and develop the hackan or Yucca baccata. This last night’s per-
formance is varied and interesting, and all persons, including whites
and Indians of other tribes, are permitted to witness it; but previously,
for several days, in the medicine lodge, mystie rites are celebrated, to
the most of which only the initiated are admitted. Dr. Matthews re-
mained in the Indian camp at Nihotlize ten days, during which time
the shamans admitted him into their medicine lodge and allowed him
to observe their rites and practices.

His most interesting discovery on this occasion was of their system
of mythic dry-paintings, by which they represent with dry pigments,
on the sanded floor of the medicine lodge, various legends or traditions.
These pictures are from 10 to 12 feet in diameter, and are drawn with
scrupulous care after long-established patterns, which are retained only
in the memories of the initiated. The drawing of some of the more elab-
orate pictures occupies the time of about a dozen men for eight or more
hours. Half an hour after the work is completed it is, with song and
ceremonial, entirely obliterated, and even the sand which formed the
ground work of the picture is removed from the lodge and thrown away.
Only one picture is painted ina day. Dr. Matthews made accurate col-
ored copies of these pictures, which will be represented by chromo-litho-
graphic plates to illustrate a detailed report prepared by him for publi-
cation by the Bureau.

When the ceremony at Nihotlizi was over he proceeded to a locality
in Arizona called by the whites “The Haystacks,” from the peculiar
appearance of the rock formations there. At the Haystacks another
great ceremony, probably the second in importance of the Navajo rites,
was to take place. Here he again encamped with the Indians, and
remained until the work of the shamans was done. The ceremonial
observances witnessed on this occasion are, collectively, called by the
Navojos Kledje quatal, or “chant of the night.” They are called by the
whites the “‘ Yay bichy dance,” from the name of the principal masked
character Yéibiteai or Gebiteai, the grand uncle of the gods. Like the
REFORT OF THE SECRETARY, 61

Hoshkaun dance, it has several days of secret rites with elaborate
symbolic sand pictures, and one night of public dances, less varied and
interesting than those of the Hoshkaun. Dr. Matthews was permitted
to witness the whole performance and to takeas many notes and sketches
as were necessary.

From the Haystacks Dr. Matthews went to the Indian ageney at
Fort Defiance, Ariz., where he secured the services of one of the oldest,
and most learned (in their own peculiar lore) of the Navajo priests, and
from him he obtained full explanations of all these rites, and of the sym-
bolism of the pictures and masked characters, with a complete recital
of the long and elaborate myths on which the ceremonies depend, and
the text and translations of the very numerous songs which form the
ritual of the ceremonies.

During the summer and fall of 1885, Dr. H. C. Yarrow, acting as-
sistant surgeon U.S. Army, visited interesting points in Arizona and
Utah. In the vicinity of Springerville, Apache County, Arizona, in
company with Mr. fh. W. Nelson, he visited a number of ancient pueblos
and discovered that the people formerly occupying the towns had
followed the custom of burying their dead, just outside the walls of
their habitations, marking the places of sepulcher with circles of stones.
The graves were 4 or 5 feet in depth, and with the dead had been de-
posited various household utensils. Mr. Nelson, who had made a care-
ful search for these cemeteries, informed him of the whereabouts of
hundreds of them. Unfortunately for anthropometric science, most of
the bones are too much decayed to be of practical value. The places
of burial selected at these pueblos are similar to the burial places dis-
covered in 1874 near the large ruined pueblo of Abiquiu, in the valley
of the Chama, New Mexico. He also visited the Moki pueblos in Ari-
zona, and obtained from one of the principal men a clear and succinct
account of their burial customs. While there he witnessed the famous
snake-dance, which occurs every two years, and is supposed to have the
effect of producing rain. From his knowledge of the reptilian fauna of
the country he was able to identify the species of serpents used in the
dance, and from personal examination satisfied himself that the fangs
had not been extracted from the poisonous varieties. He thinks, how-
ever, that the reptiles during the four days that they are kept in the
estufas are Somewhat tamed by handling, and possibly are made to
eject the greater part of the venom contained in the sacs at the roots
of the teeth, by being teased and forced to strike at different objects
held near them. Hedoes not think that avegetable decoction in which
they are washed has a stupefying effect, as has been supposed by some.
He also obtained from a Moki high priest a full account of the attend-
ant ceremonies of the dance. Through the hospitality of Mr. Thomas
V. Keam, of Keam’s Caiion, Arizona, and Mr. A. M. Stephen, he was

burial customs of his people, as well as valuable information regarding
their medical practices, especially such as relate to obstetrics.

From Arizona Dr. Yarrow proceeded to Utah, and made an examina-
tion of an old rock cemetery near Farmington, finding it similar to the
one he discovered in 1872 near the town of Fillmore. The bodies had
been carried far up the side of the mountain; cavities had been pre-
pared in a rock slide, and the bodies placed therein. Branches of cot-
tonwood were then laid ever and large bowlders piled on top. In sev-
eral of these graves the skeletons were in fair preservation, and were
removed, as well as the articles found with them.

Through the kindness of Mr. William Young, of Grantsville, a skele-
ton of a Gosi-Ute, in excellent preservation, was obtained, which has
been presented to the Army Medical Museum. It may be stated that
the examination of the rock cemetery at Farmington showed that the
inhabitants of the eastern slope of the Wahsatch Range, in Great Salt
Lake Valley, followed that mode of sepulture from this, the most north-
ern point visited, to below Parowan, a distance of at least 200 miles to
the southward, and it seems that these people occupied the valley long
subsequent to those living near the water courses who constructed the
small mounds on top of which were the rude adobe dwellings, and in
some instances used these huts for burial purposes.

In the spring of 1886 Mr. James C. Pilling made a trip to Europe in
the interest of his work on the Bibliography of the Languages of the
North American Indians, and spent many days in the library of the
British Museum, the Bibliotheque Nationale at Paris, and several ex-
tensive private libraries in England and France. The results of this
trip are highly satisfactory and valuable.

Mr. Jeremiah Curtin continued to collect vocabularies and myths in
California. The whole number of myths obtained in California and
Oregon was over three hundred. The number of vocabularies was eight,
being the Yana, Atsugéi (Hat Creek), Wasco, Milé-hlama (Warm
Spring), Pai Ute, Shasta, Maidu, and Wintu. Texts were also obtained
in Yana, Wasco, Warm Spring, and Shasta.

Il OFFICE WORK.

Prof. Cyrus Thomas was engaged during the year, except the few
weeks he was in the field, in the preparation of his general report, a paper
on the Maya Codices, and a special paper on the Burial Mounds of the
Northern Sections of the United-States. The latter will appear in the
Fifth Annual Report of the Bureau.

Mrs. V. L. Thomas, in addition to her duties as clerk, has been em-
ployed in preparing a catalogue of the ancient works in that part of the
United States east of the Rocky Mountains. This catalogue, now
nearly complete, is intended to give the localities and character of all

the antiquities in the section indicated that have been heretofore dis-
_ covered and notice thereof published, as well as those mentioned in the
reports of work done under the Bureau.

The “ Bibliography of the Languages of the North American In-
_dians,” by Mr. James C. Pilling, which has been adverted to in previous
' reports, has received a large share of his time and attention through-
out the year. The advance “ proof-sheets” noted under the head of
publications, and distributed to collaborators, have been the means of
| securing the active co-operation of many persons throughout this and

other countries who are interested in linguistic and bibliographie sci-
ence, and have thus elicited a large number of additions, corrections,
‘suggestions, and criticisms, all of which have received careful consid-
eration.

Mr. Frank H. Cushing worked, when his health permitted, upon the
large amount of Zuni material collected by him during several years, in
preparation of papers upon the language, mythology, and institutions
of that people.

Mrs. Erminnie A. Smith continued her study of the Iroquoian
languages. The first part of her final contribution on the subject
was intended to be a Tuscarora grammar and dictionary. The first
portion of the dictionary was completed, and had been forwarded
to the Bureau when her sudden and Jamented death occurred on
June 9, 1886, at her home in Jersey City. Her former assistant,
Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, of Tuscarora descent, has been engaged to
complete the work she so successfully began, and it is expected that
the results of her long labors in the field will be published without
delay.

Mr. Charles C. Royce resigned his connection with the Bureau in the
early part of the year, thereby delaying the completion of his werk
upon the primal title of the Indian tribes to lands within the United
States and the methods of securing their relinquishment. This work,
the scope and value of which have before been explained, will be pub-
lished with its accompanying atlas. Mr. Royce, before his departure,
completed a paper on the “Cherokee Nation of Indians,” which will ap-
pear in the Fifth Annual Report.

Dr. H. C. Yarrow was still engaged in preparing the material for the
final volume upon the Mortuary Customs of the North American In-
dians, in the prosecution of which the large amount of information re-
ceived and obtained from various sources has been carefully classified
and arranged under proper divisions, so that the manuscript is now
being rapidly put into shape for publication.

e Dr. Washington Matthews, U.S. Army, continued the preparing for
publication of the copious notes obtained by him during former years
in the Navajo country, his chief work being upon a grammar and dic-
tionary of the Navajo language. He also wrote several papers, one of
64 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

which, a “Chant upon the Mountains ” will appear in the Fifth Annual —
Report. :

Mr. W. H. Holmes continued his work in the office during the year,
superintending the illustration of the various publications of the Bureau.
His scientific studies have been confined principally to the field of Ameri-
can art archeology. Two fully illustrated papers have been finished
and will appear in the Sixth Annual Report of the Bureau. They are
upon “Ancient Art of the Province of Chiriqui, Colombia,” and “A
Study of the Textile Art in its Relations to the Development of Form
and Ornament.” Mr. Holmes has, in addition, continued his duties as
curator of aboriginal pottery in the National Museum.

The office work of Mr. Victor Mindeleff for the year has consisted of
the preparation of reports on the Tusayan and Cibola architectural
groups. These, when completed, are to be fully illustrated by a series
of plans and drawings now being prepared from the field-notes and other
material. In this work it is proposed to discuss the architecture in de-
tail, particularly in the case of the modern pueblos, where many of the
constructional devices of the old builders still survive. The examina-
tion of these details will be found to throw light on obscure features of
many ruined pueblos whose state of preservation is such as to exhibit
but little detail in themselves.

In connection with the classification and arrangement oem new material
from Cafion de Chelly, a paper on the cliff-ruins of this region was pre-
pared.

The modeling-room during the past year has been in charge of Mr.
Cosmos Mindeleff. Upon his return from the field a series of models to
illustrate the Chaco ruins, architecturally the most important in the
Southwest, was commenced. Two of these, viz, the ruin of Wejegi and
that of a small pueblo near Pueblo Alto, have been finished and dupli-
cates have been deposited in the National Museum. ‘The third, a very
large model of Peiiasco Blanco, is still uncompleted. All of these
models are made from entirely new surveys, made in thesummer of 1884.
The scale used in the previous series—the inhabited pueblos and the »
cliff-ruins—though larger than that usually adopted for this class of
work, has shown so much more detail and has proven generally so sat-
isfactory, that it has been continued in the Chaco Ruin group, bringing
the entire series of models made by the Bureau to a uniform scale of
1.60, or 1 inch to 5 feet, In addition to this the work of duplicating
the existing models of the Bureau for purposes of exchange was com-
menced. Three of these have been completed, and two others are about
half finished.

Mr. E. W. Nelson was engaged upon a report of his investigations®
among the Eskimo tribes of Alaska. A part of this report consisting
of an English-Eskimo dictionary, he has already forwarded.

As hereinafter explained, the year was principally devoted to the syn-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 65

onomy of the Indian tribes, the special studies of several officers of the
Bureau being suspended so that their whole time should be employed
in that direction. In the early part of the year 1885, however, and at
subsequent intervals, their work was as follows:

Col. Garrick Mallery, U.S. Army, continued the study, by researches
and correspondence, of sign language and pictographs. A paper on
the latter subject has been printed in the Fourth Annual Report.

Mr. Albert 8. Gatschet continued to revise and perfect his grammar
and dictionary of the Klamath language, a large part of which work is
in print. He also took down vocabularies from Indian delegates present
in this city on tribal business, and thus succeeded in incorporating into
the collections of the Bureau of Ethnology linguistic material from the
Alibamu, Hitchiti, Creek, and Seneca languages.

Rev. J. Owen Dorsey pursued his work on the Dhegiha language.
Having the aid of a Winnebago Indian for some time he enlarged his
vocabulary of that language and recorded grammatical notes. He also
reported upon works submitted to his examination upon the Tuscarora,
Micmac, and Cherokee languages.

Synonymy of Indian Tribes.—The Director has before reported in gen-
eral terms that the most serious source of perplexity to the student of
the history of the North American Indians is the confusion existing
among their tribal names. The causes of this confusion are various.
The Indian names for themselves have been understood and recorded
in diverse ways by the earlier authors, and have been variously trans-
mitted by the later. Nicknames arising from trivial causes, and often
without apparent cause, have been imposed upon many tribes. Names
borne by one tribe at some period of its history have been transferred
to another, or to several other distinct tribes. Typographical errors
and improved spellings on assumed phonetic grounds have swelled the
number of synonyms until the investigator of a special tribe often finds
himself in a maze of nomenclatural perplexity.

It has long been the intention of the Director to have prepared a work
on tribal names, which so far as possible should refer their confusing
titles to a correct and systematic standard. Delay has been occasioned
chiefly by the fundamental necessity of defining the linguistic stocks or
families into which all tribes must be primarily divided, and to accom-
plish this long journeys and laborious field and office investigations
have been required during the whole time since the establishment of
the Bureau. While a few points still remained in an unsatisfactory
condition, it was considered that a sufficient degree of accuracy had
been attained to allow of the publication for the benefit of students of
“a volume devoted to the subject. The preparation of the plan of such
a volume was intrusted to Mr. H. W. Henshaw late in the spring of
1885, and in June of that year the work was energetically begun in ac-

H. Mis. 170

66 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

cordance with the plans submitted. The preparation of this work,
which to a great extent underlies and is the foundation for every field
of ethnologic investigation among Indians, was considered of such
prime importance that nearly all the available force of the Bureau was
placed upon it to the suspension of the particular investigations in
which the several officers had been engaged. In addition to the gen-
eral charge of the whole work, Mr. Henshaw gave special attention to
the families inhabiting the Northwest coast from Oregon northwards,
including the Eskimo, and also several in California. To Mr. Albert
S. Gatschet the tribes of the Southeastern United States, together
with the Pueblo and Yuman tribes, were assigned.

The Algonkian family in all its branches—by farthe most important
part of the whole, so far as the great bulk of literature relating to it
is concerned—was intrusted to Col. Garrick Mallery and Mr. James
Mooney. They also took charge of the Iroquoian family. Mr. J. O.
Dorsey’s intimate acquaintance with the tribes of the Siouan and Cad-
doan families peculiarly fitted him to cope with that part of the work,
and he also undertook the Athapasean tribes. Dr. W. J. Hoffman
worked upon the Shoshonian tribes, aided by the Director’s personal
supervision. Mr. Curtin, to whom was assigned the California tribes,
also gave assistance in other sections.

Each of the gentlemen named has been able to contribute largely to
the results by his personal experience and investigations in the field,
there being numerous regions concerning which published accounts are
meager and unsatisfactory. The main source of the material to be
dealt with has, however, been necessarily derived from books. A vast
amount of the current literature pertaining to the North American In-
dians has been examined, amounting to over one thousand volumes,
with a view to the extraction of the tribal names‘and the historical data
necessary to fix their precise application.

The work at the present time is well advanced toward completion.
The examination of literature for the collation of synonyms may be
regarded as practically done. The tables of synonymy and the ac-
counts of the tribes have been completed for more than one-half the
number of linguistic families. It is hoped that the volume will be
ready for the printer by the end of the next fiseal year.

Archeologic Symbols.—The geographic distribution of archzologie phe-
nomena being of great importance, and the statute having provided for
general archeologic research in the United States, it was thought best
by the Director to prepare a system of archzologic symbols to be used
in the cartography of the subject. In the preparation of such a scheme
of symbols those used in Europe were examined, for the purpose of
adopting the same where possible; but on careful study of the subject
it was found that the phenomena of the two continents differ so widely
that no European scheme could be utilized in North America. A new

scheme was therefore prepared, adapted to the phenomena observed in
North America, and especially in the United States, as follows:

UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.

In compliance with the custom which has grown up of including a
summary of the yearly operations of the Geological Survey in the an-
nual report of this Institution, a statement furnished by Maj. J. W.
Powell, the Director of the Survey, is appended hereto.

The last report which was made was for the calendar year 1884; and
the present account is for the following eighteen months.

During each of the years under review, the appropriations for the
Survey were substantially the same, and the organization was practi-
eally unchanged.

As heretofore, detailed statements of the operations of the Survey
will be found under the headings of Geography, Geology, Paleontology,
and Miscellaneous Work, the latter including chemistry and physics,
mining statistics and technology, and library and documents.

GEOGRAPHY.

At the date of the last report a statement was made under the vari-
ous subdivisions of this heading of the areas which had been surveyed
in the different States and Territories. Including those, and the areas
subsequently surveyed during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1885, the
chief geographer of the Survey, Mr. Henry Gannett, reports a total of
57,508 square miles. A glance at the appended table will show the
distribution of these areas, the scale of publication adopted, and the
contour interval: .

The average cost of the work during the year was approximately
$2.75 per square mile.

Under the Division of Geography the work in the northeastern see-
tion is divided into two sub-sections, namely, those of Massachusetts
and New Jersey. In the former the work is carried on at the joint ex-
pense of the State of Massachusetts and the United States. In this
State the entire area reported for the two years during which work has
been going on, amounts to 3,750 square miles, or nearly one-half the
area of the State.

Work in the New Jersey sub-section was, as heretofore, under the
general supervision of Prof. George H. Cook, State manila The
work has been continued on the basis indicated in the last report, and
an area of 3,111 square miles has been completely surveyed in the past
two years, while a considerable amount of preliminary work has been
done on other portions of the State. At the present time nearly all
the area of the State has been completed.

Appalachian Section.—The intricacy of geologic phenomena in this
region has led to the adoption of a larger scale for the maps than that
which has been used in other cases; as the country is perhaps the most
difficult for the surveyor to be found upon the continent, the rate and
cost of work will not bear favorable comparison with other less difficult
areas. However, notwithstanding these drawbacks, the large force con-
centrated on the area has enabled the geographer in charge of it, Mr.
Gilbert Thompson, to complete 41,326 square miies in the two years
under consideration.

Western Section.—During the year ending June 30, 1885, work was
prosecuted in the Missouri Kansas, Texas, and Arizona sub-sections,
and in the following year, to this section were added the Gold Belt
and Cascade sub-sections. It was found that in those States which had
70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

been surveyed by the public land system, use might be made of the plats
of the General Land Office, whereby without sacrificing accuracy the
work might be greatly facilitated. For the control and correction of
the surveys of the General Land Office it was decided tentatively to
use astronomic locations, and these Mr. R. S. Woodward, formerly of
the U.S. Lake Survey, was directed to determine. As shown by the
table already given, an area was surveyed in this sub-section, during
the two years, of 37,000 square miles. In continuing the work in the
Missouri-Kansas sub-section during the last fiscal year, closing June
00, 1886, it was decided to substitute a gridiron system of triangula-
tion, utilizing as far as possible the trans-continental belt of the U.S.
Coast and Geodetic Survey, in place of astronomie determinations, for
the correction of accumulated error in the surveys of the General Land
Office. Satisfactory progress was made in the Texas and Arizona sub-
sections, but work was impeded in the Gold Belt and Cascade sub-
sections by unfavorable at mospheric conditions during the latter part
of the last season. Notwithstanding these drawbacks an area of more
than 50,050 square miles was surveyed during the last fiscal year.

Yellowstone Section.—During the two years under review topographic
work was continued in the Yellowstone National Park, and an area of
1,000 square miles was surveyed in the first year, and 5,600 in the sec-
ond, the latter figure including a portion of Northwestern Wyoming.

Hngraving.—The manuscript of seventy-six sheets of the General At-
las of the United States, now in preparation by the Geological Survey
has been furnished to the engraver, and of these fifty-seven have been
engraved, comprising about 125,000 square miles. In the Seventh An-
nual Report of the Director of the Survey to the Secretary of the Inte-
rior a list is given of the sheets thus far engraved.

GEOLOGY.

The present organization of geologic work in the Survey will be ap-
prehended from an examination of the following condensed account of
the work of each of the divisions:

Division of Archean Geology.— Prof. Raphael Pumpelly devoted his
time in the field to a study of the structure of the Green Mountains,
believing that range to contain the key to the geology of New England.
The structure of a long and important stretch of the Hoosac Mountain
in Massachusetts and Vermont was worked out, and Professor Pum-
pelly hopes by the end of another season to be in a position to solve
this great geologic problem. A large part of his office work was upon
the “‘ Mining Industries” volume of the Tenth Census.

Atlantic Coast Division of Geology.—In his study of the geology of
the Atlantic coast Prof. N.S. Shaler has addressed himself especially
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. rél

to problems whose solution promises to have important economic value.
After making a preliminary inquiry into the geology of the Cobscook
Bay district, he began a study of the district adjacent to Narragansett
Bay, the coal-fields of which he compares in character with those of
Pennsylvania, and hopes to see rendered commercially important. An-
other inquiry to which he has given attention is the amount of salt-
water marshes on the eastern coast of the United States, the extent to
which these are reclaimed, and the most feasible means of bringing
them into tillable condition. The experience of other countries he
found to be of such a character as to justify the hope that at least
20,000 square miles, and possibly twice that area, may be easily won to
agriculture. Professor Shaler publishes a report on the ‘Salt Marshes
of the United States” in the Sixth Annual Report of the Director of
the Survey, and a report on the ‘Geology of Martha’s Vineyard” in
the seventh.

Appalachian Division of Geology.—Mr. G. K. Gilbert eontinued, with
a corps of assistants, the investigation of the geology of the Appala
chian Mountains in the States of Maryland, Virginia, West Virginia,
Kentucky, Tennessee, North Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama. In the
systematic conduct of this work he proposes to survey and measure
with great care four sections, crossing the belt at right angles. The
rocks to be studied being much disturbed, a simple linear section does
not afford a sufficient guarantee of accuracy, and he substitutes for it
the complete structural survey of a strip of country 20 miles broad.
When this is finished it is believed that the structure of the entire belt
can be unraveled with comparative ease and rapidity. Of Mr. Gilbert’s
assistants, Mr. Bailey Willis was engaged on the French Broad section,
Mr. I. C. Russell on the Alabama section, Mr. H. R. Geiger on the Po-
tomac section, and Prof. I. C. White made an investigation of the strati-
graphy of the coal-measures in the valley of the Great Kanawha. The
geologic literature of the Appalachian district being very copious, and
Mr. Gilbert being unwilling to pass by without acknowledgment the
work of his predecessors, a subject bibliography of this literature has
been undertaken, and 6,000 bibliographic cards have been prepared,
which contain each a reference to the pages in a specific volume in which
any particular subject is treated. The memoirs relative to the investiga-
tion of the “ Quaternary History of the Great Basin” are in substan-
tially the same condition as last reported.

Lake Superior Division of Geology.—Iin this division Prof. R. D. Ir-
ving is engaged in a general investigation of those formations of. the
Northwestern States which underlie the basal fossiliferous or Potsdam
sandstone of the Mississippi Valley. A large portion of the field work
of Mr. Irving’s assistants was spent in replacing the collections which
they were so unfortunate as to lose by the fire that occurred in the
science building of the University of Wisconsin in December, 1884. In
d2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

his administrative report for the year 1886 he gives a summarized state-
ment of the results which have been reached by the studies in which
he and his associates have been engaged.

Among these the following may be mentioned: (1) The origin of the
ferruginous schists of the Lake Superior region and their accompany-
ing iron ores is attributable to the silicification of ferruginous carbon-
ates in some degree analogous to those of the coal-measures. (2) The
Archean formations of Lake Superior are divisible into two discordant
members, to which the terms Huronian and Laurentian should be ap-
plied. (3) Such chloritic schists as present themselves at the falls of
the Menomonee River, on the boundary between Wisconsin and Michi-
gan, are the result of metasomatic alteration, accompanying great press-
ure, of some sort of eruptive greenstone. (4) The upper mica schists
of the iron-bearing series have been developed in both the Penokee and
the Marquette regions from entirely fragmental rocks, composed mainly -
of quartz and feldspar, by a simple, easily traced process of metaso-
matosis.

Division of Glacial Geology.—Prof. T. C. Chamberlin and his assist-
ants, Prof. R. D. Salisbury, Prof. J. E. Todd, Mr. Warren Upham, Prof.
G. H. Stone, Prof. G. I’. Wright, and Mr. I. M. Buell, were engaged in a
comprehensive study of the manifold features of glacial geology, par-
ticularly as recorded in the rocks of the northwestern séction of the
United States. To the discussion of this question, Professor Chamberlin
has contributed two extended articles, one appearing in the Sixth An-
nual Report, under the heading of the “ Driftless Area of the United
States,” and the other in the seventh, under the title of the “ Rock Scor-
ings of the Great Ice Invasion.” His assistant, Mr. Upham, after making
an extended investigation of the area of the extinct lake (Agassiz),
submitted the manuscript for a bulletin, which will appear among the
publications of the Survey hereafter. In company with Prof. Salisbury,
Prof. Chamberlin undertook a reconnoissance of the drift margin from
the vicinity of Bismarck, Dak., to the national boundary line at the foot
of the Rocky Mountains. No attempt was made to trace the drift-border
in detail, but it was sought to determine a sufficient number of points
to fix beyond question the general course and character of the drift
in Northwestern Dakota and in Montana. After about a inonth spent
in this examination, Prof. Chamberlin studied the valley-drift of the
Yellowstone River, at Billings, and in the vicinity of Glendive, with —
a view to distinguishing this semi-local drift from that of the north-
east, as well as to determining the ancient fluvial conditions of the re-
gion. He also spent about a month in the study of drift phenomena
in Montana, Idaho, and British Columbia. Professor Todd’s time was
devoted to field study in southern Dakota, and the preparation of a
bulletin on his results. Professor Stone, under the direction of Prof.
Chamberlin, continued his special investigations of the gravels of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 73

Maine, particularly its remarkable osars, and Prof. G. F. Wright studied
the glacial border in Pennsylvania and the terraces of the Upper Alle-
ghany River: Prof. W. M. Davis, of Harvard University, working under
Prof. Chamberlin’s direction, made a careful study of the striation of
Mount Monadnock, one result of which was a very satisfactory demon-
stration of the incurving of the currents in the lee of that mountain.
He also made an examination of two recent gorges near Canajoharie, N.
Y., with reference to the time and method of their production; but his
chief attention was directed to the study of the remarkable parallel and
dolphin-backed drift ridges of Wayne and Cayuga Counties in the same
State. Mr. Buell continued his study of the bowlder trains of the south
central Wisconsin. Prof. Chamberlin was assisted both by Mr. Gilbert
and Prof. Shaler in a number of his glacial studies, and the latter car-
ried out an extended scheme of study of the glacial drift on the islands
of Nantucket, Martha’s Vineyard, and Mount Desert.

Montana Division of Geology.—Dr. ¥. V. Hayden, with his assistant,
Dr. A. C. Peale, continued his study of the geology of Montana, his in-
quiries chietly relating to the Gallatin Valley, particular attention being
paid to the southern end of the Bridger Range and the extension of its
beds on the southern side of the Gallatin Valley. In addition to this
work Dr. Peale prepared a statistical paper on the Mineral Waters of
the United States, which was published as Bulletin No. 32 of the Survey
series.

Yellowstone Park Division of Geology.—Notwithstanding the limited
character of the field season in the Yellowstone Park, Mr. Arnold Hague
was able to reach tolerably definite conclusions respecting the more re-
markable of its geological features. The work in the field was supple-
mented by detailed studies in the laboratory, Dr. I’. A. Gooch confining
himself almost exclusively to chemical questions connected with the
thermal waters of the geyser basins and Mammoth Hot Springs, and Dr.
Hallock continuing his investigations on the physics of geyser action.
Mr. J. P. Iddings, in investigating the acidic lavas of the park, prepared
for the Seventh Annual Report of the Director a paper entitled ‘ Ob-
sidian Cliff of Yellowstone Park,” which not only gives a description of
Obsidian Cliff, but presents a résumé of all that is known as to the erup-
tions of obsidian in other parts of the world. Mr. Hague dwells upon
the need of Congressional action to settle the definite boundaries of the
Park, and reiterates his previous suggestions as to the limits which should
be adopted. He also adverts to the great importance of the Yellow-
stone Park asa forest reservation, stating that he is acquainted with no
tract in the Rocky Mountains where the necessity for the conservation
of the forests appears so urgent or the direct advantage to be gained so
immediate.

Colorado Division of Geology.—The field work in this division since
the date of the last report has been mainly carried on by Mr. Emmons?’
74 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

assistants, he himself having been principally engaged in the prepara-
tion of material for publication. Such field work as was done under his
direction was mainly in the Gunnison or Crested Butte region and in the
Denver Basinregion. His assistants, Messrs. Cross and Eldridge, made
large collections of specimens, and the former, in the course of his work,
made a number of important contributions to petrography.

California Division of Geology.—Resuming his field studies of the ge-
ology of the quicksilver deposits of the Pacific slope, Mr. G. I’. Becker
brought his. investigation to a conclusion, and devoted himself to the
preparation of a monograph on the results. This monograph is now in
an advanced state, and will soon be placed in the hands of the printer.
In his observation of the stratigraphy of California Mr. Becker was led
to consider a number of the physical and chemical questions involved,
and his work upon these resulted in the disclosure of certain novel laws
of mechanics and physics that are believed to have a high value. Thus,
in considering the fundamental shape of volcanic cones, Mr. Becker
found that the form of such cones could be determined mathematically
with all possible definiteness, and that this form coincides in the most
remarkable way with photographs of actual voleanic cones in America
and Japan. <A contribution to the general law of mechanics which grew
out of his investigation of quicksilver is called a theorem of maximum
dissipativity, according to which there is in every system a tendeney to
motions of a shorter period, this tendency being the greatest possible
when the motions of the system have periods which differ considerably.

Division of Voleanic Geology.—Cantain C. E. Dutton, with his assistant,
Mr. J.S. Diller, devoted his field work to a study of the Cascade Range
and its geological relation to the Coast Ranges. The belt of country be-
tween the shore of the Pacific and the Cascade Range he finds to be
occupied by mountains which do not group themselves into distinct
ranges, but which are crowded closely together and present forms alte-
gether peculiar by reason of their irregularity, want of definite trend,
and absence of anything approaching structural axes. The attitudes
of the older rocks in this region disclose a scene of stratigraphic confu-
sion, displacement, and distortion without a parallel in his experience.
The most striking feature of the Cascade Range is undoubtedly Crater
Lake, of which Captain Dutton made a thorough examination. The
occurrence of several notable earthquake tremors in the Atlantic States
in the summer and autumn of 1884, and the fact that such disturbances
are more numerous than is generally supposed, led to some preliminary
measures under the direction of Captain Dutton looking to the estab-
lishment of systematic observations of such phenomena. <A consulta-
tion was held between several members of the Geological Survey corps
and Prof. C. G. Rockwood, of Princeton, Mr. W. M. Davis, of Harvard,

Prof. Cleveland Abbe, of the Signal Service, and Mr. H. M. Paul, of ©

the Naval Observatory. It was determined that the only practicable
scheme would be to rely upon the voluntary and unpaid co-operation of
individual observers and upon the aid which might be gained from
the assistants of the Signal Service and other Government bureaus
having permanent stations scattered throughout the country. Mr. ©,
I’. Marvin, of the Signal Service, undertook to devise an jnstrument,
inexpensive and simple, and requiring a minimum of care and atten-
tion, which could be used by volunteers m making their observations.
Numerous respenses have been received to the circulars that were sent
out asking for assistance in this work.

Potomac Division of Geology—Mr. W J McGee continued his geo-
logic investigation of the District of Columbia and contiguous territory
as the condition of the topographic survey of the area under discussion
permitted. He gave special attention to the Potomac formation, both
as disclosed in the District of Columbia and elsewhere, and, in the ab-
sence of fossil faunas characterizing the formation, he availed himself of
the assistance of Professors Ward and Fontaine in reaching some con-
clusions as to its taxonomy through a study of its fossil flora. A large
amount of miscellaneous office work is intrusted to the chief of this di-
vision, and the most important subjects of this character which have en-
gaged his attention during the period under review are briefly referred
to below. Mr. McGee continued to assist the Director in developing a
cartographic system, which, while sufficiently comprehensive to repre-
sent the rock masses in the entire dominion of the United States, is at
the same time sufficiently definite to be intelligible to all users of the
geologic maps published by the Survey and sufficiently elastic to per-
mit the employment of classifications of rocks now in vogue or such as
may be hereafter evolved. The work has led to the preparation of a
bulletin entitled “A Contribution to the Areal Geology of the United
States,” which is now nearly ready for the press. A meeting of the
Congrés Géologique International was held at Berlin in September and
October, 1885, and Mr. McGee represented the Director of the Survey in
its deliberations, presenting to if a formal communication on his behalf.
The principal function of this Congress, which was organized largely
through the instrumentality of American geologists, is the improve-
ment and unification of conventions employed in geologic cartography.
Under Mr. McGee’s direction a bibliography of the geology of Texas
has been prepared and is nearly ready to send to the press. The Sur-
vey having undertaken to compile a history of American State surveys,
from data contributed as far as possible by those who have engaged in
the work, the material has been placed in Mr. McGee’s hands, and a
manuscript history of American State surveys is now substantially com-
plete. To the gentlemen who have generously turned aside from other
duties and interests and prepared material for this proposed history,
the profound obligations of the Survey are warmly extended.
76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Louisiana Division of Geology.—Owing to the importance of the iron
ores of Northern Louisiana, a division of geology was established, with
Mr. Lawrence C. Johnson at its head, to investigate the localities in
this region in which iron ores were known or supposed to be deposited.
Mr. Johnson has performed a large amount of preliminary work, but
his material is not yet in such a condition as to permit of publication.

PALEONTOLOGY.

Division of Vertebrate Paleontology.—In continuing his systematic
work of collecting fossils in the West, Prof. O. C. Marsh states the
two objects he has had especially in view, as follows: First, to deter-
mine the geologic horizon of each locality where large series of verte-
brate fossils were found, and, second, to secure from these localities
collections of the more important forms sufficiently extensive to dis-
close, if possible, the life history of each. With the paucity of remains
of plants and invertebrates in many regions of the West, the value of
vertebrate fossils, especially of the higher types, in enabling us to get
a more accurate and detailed geologic record, is manifest. It is hoped
that the collections of the remains of the vertebrate life throughout the
Rocky Mountian region in past ages, now being made, will afford the
means of solving many profound problems, since some of the most im-
portant chapters in the history of life on the globe are recorded here
alone.

The suecess of Professor Marsh and his assistants in their tield work
has been most gratifying, and the more difficult work of classifying the
extensive collections secured has been systematically and rapidly
carried on.

Paleozoic Division of Invertebrate Paleontology.—The field operations
of Mr. C. D. Walcott, the chief of this division, were directed as follows:
(1) The continuation of the study of the Devonian strata and contained
faunas in Southern and Western New York; (2) the study of Cambrian
strata in Alabama, Georgia, and Tennessee, and the collection of fossils
from numerous localities; (3) the examination of a number of sections
of Cambrian strata in Central Nevada and Northern Utah and the col-
lection of fossils; (4) the taking of a section of the Permian formation
in Southern Utah and the collecting of fossils from three loca! ities in
the section, and (5) the examination of certain Middle Cambrian rocks
from Columbia County, New York, and the collecting of Lower
Silurian fossils in Central New York. In these operations he was as-
sisted by Prof. H. 8. Williams, who is preparing a monograph on the
Devonian faunas, and by Messrs. Cooper Curtice, A. M. Gibson,
S. W. Ford, W. P. Rust, and others. With the data now in his pos-
session, Mr. Walcott believes that most of the Paleozoic fossils hereto-
fore collected in the entire Rocky Mountain region can be referred to
their true stratigraphic horizons, but further study will be needed on
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 77

the faunas that preceded the Middle Cambrian fauna. During the year
he prepared a paper on the Middle Cambrian faunas of North America,
which was published as Bulletin 30 of the Survey series.

Mesozoic Division of Invertebrate Paleontology.—Dr. C. A. White, the
chief of this division, carried on field operations chiefly in Utab and
Wyoming. The work he planned for the season was the stratigraphie
and paleontologic study of the later Cretaceous and early Tertiary forma-
tions. As results of his studies in the field it is shown that a portion
of the fresh-water molluscan species which characterize the Laramie
group survived their brackish-water contemporaries and became a part
of the purely fresh-water molluscan faunas of the Wasatch group.
This indicates that there was a continuity of congenial aqueous habitat
for those mollusks from the Laramie to the Wasatch epoch, and the
observed character of the strata also indicates that sedimentation was
continuous from the one group to the other. The observations upon
the Jurassic strata and their fossil contents which he was able to make
during the past season, together with those previously made, seem to
justify the opinion that a large continental area existed upon the site
of the present North American continent during the latter part of the
Jurassic period. An important feature of Dr. White’s office work during
the past fiscal year was the transfer of all the fossils belonging to the
Survey and in charge of his division to the newly allotted space in the
northeast balcony in the second story of the National Museum building,
where all the specimens were cleansed, numbered, and stored away in
cases for convenient reference.

Cenozoic Division of Invertebrate Paleontology.—On being placed in
charge of this division Mr. W. H. Dall’s first efforts were directed to
putting into shape for ready reference and the identification of species
as they should come in, the Quaternary fossils of Nerth America that
have come into the possession of the Geological Survey. The land and
fresh-water forms of the ancient lake basins of the West and the loess
of the Mississippi Valley, and the marine forms from the southern and
southeastern portions of the United States bordering on the sea, being
by far the most important, the classification of these was first under-
taken. It is gratifying to be able to state that the large collections of
Quaternary fossils and allied recent forms have been suitably classified
and conveniently arranged for study. In the year ending June 30,
1886, 15,638 lots of specimens, including not less than 60,000 individ-
uals, have been labeled, registered, and put in order, about one-half as
much as during the whole of the previous twenty-five years since the
beginning of the work. A small amount of field work was done in
South Carolina and in Louisiana and Texas.

Division of Paleobotany.—In the year following that for which a re-
port was last made, Prof. L. F. Ward devoted himself almost exclu-
78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

sively to office work. As a result of this he prepared for the Sixth
Annual Report of the Director a paper entitled “‘ Synopsis of the Flora
of the Laramie Group,” profusely illustrated. Early in the present
fiscal year Prof. Ward prosecuted field work along the bluffs of the
Potomac and Rappahannock Rivers. He also made an expedition down
the James to City Point and up the Appomattox to Petersburg. In
these trips he was accompanied at different times by Prof. W. M. Fon-
taine, Mr. W J McGee, and Mr. Ff. H. Knowlton. In the office he
prepared technical descriptions of the species figured for publication,
without description, in the Sixth Annual Report of the Director, and
drew them up in the form of a bulletin of the Survey, entitled ‘“ Types
of the Laramie Flora,” and numbered 37 of that series. Prof. Ward
is making satisfactory progress in the extensive bibliographic work he
has undertaken in connection with his subject. Prof. Leo Lesquereux
has undertaken the preparation of a volume of descriptions and illus-
trations of Cretaceous and Tertiary plants.

Prof. Fontaine devoted the period which has elapsed since the date
of the last report to the continuation of the study of the younger Meso-
zoic, or Potomac, formation, both in field and office. He discusses the
plant material which has been collected from both a geological and
botanical point of view, since .the plants fill a most important gap in
geologic records. Both the geologie and paleontologic reports will soon
be ready for the printer.

Division of Fossil Insects —At the beginning of the present calendar
year Prof. Samuel H. Scudder, the greatest living authority on the sub-
ject of fossil insects, was appointed to a position on the Survey, and
placed in charge of a division designated “The Division of Fossil In-
sects.” He has devoted his time thus far (1) to the collection of insects
from the peat deposits of Nantucket; (2) to a determination of insects
from the interglacial clays of our northern border; and (3) to a system-
atic study of the Carabide of the Oligocene beds of the Florissant.
Mr. Seudder also prepared for publication as a bulletin of the Survey
a review of our present knowledge of fossil insects.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Division of Chemistry and Physics.—In this division Prof. F. W. Clarke
reports slight changes in the force and equipment for the present
year; but a few additions have been made in each direction. A large
portion of the work done by Prof. Clarke and his assistants, Messrs.
Chatard, Hillebrand, Gooch, Whitfield, and Riggs, in the chemical lab-
oratory, was of a routine nature, and grew out of applications for the
determination of rocks, minerals, and waters submitted by the various
heads of geological divisions or by the other branches of the Govern-
ment. But some attention has been given to original research. In the
latter work, the chemical division has profitably co-operated with Mr.
REPORT OF .THE SECRETARY. ‘ (08)

J.S. Diller, of the division of volcanic geology. From an investigation
of the waters of the Yellowstone National Park, made by Messrs. Gooch
and Whitfield, it is learned that all the hot waters of that region con-
tain arsenic in quite appreciable quantities. Mr. Gooch having been
elected professor of chemistry in Yale College, has severed his connece-
tion with the Survey.

In the physical laboratory Messrs. William Hallock and Carl Barus,
the latter assisted by Prof. Strouhal, of Prague, have continued phys-
ical investigations. Dr. Barus studied the internal structure of steel,
and he and Dr. Hallock jointly investigated the constancy of tempera-
ture attainable in metallic vapor baths and constructed apparatus for
the convenient calibration of thermo-electric pyrometers.

Division of Mining Statistics and Technology.—Since the last report
was made another volume on the mineral resources of the United States
has appeared under the direction of Mr. Albert Williams, jr., chief of
this division. Somewhat fuller than its predecessor, it has been in much
greater demand. While these volumes record with great care the pro-
duction of minerals in the United States for each year, the accompany-
ing text relating to the various industries is different in character from
volume to volume.

Mr. Williams having resigned, Dr. D. T. Day, of the Johns Hopkins
University, has been placed in charge of this work.

Division of Forestry.—Since the date of the last report a division of
forestry has been established in the Geological Survey, and Mr. George
W. Sbutt placed in charge thereof. Field investigations have been
made of the forestry of Virginia, North Carolina, and Kentucky, and a
large amount of material that has been received from volunteer observ-
ers in response to inquiries is in course of preparation for publication
by the Survey.

Division of Itlustrations.—Mr. W. H. Holmes, in charge of the divis-
ion of illustrations, presents a detailed report of the work which has been
done under his direction. In his administrative report for the year end-
ing June 30, 1885, he discusses the various methods employed for the
production of illustrations, and the most judicious ways of applying them,
During the two years covered by his administrative reports illustrations
have been transmitted through him for three monographs, two annual
reports, and eighteen bulletins.

Division of the Library and Documents—Y¥rom the reports of Mr. C.
C. Darwin, chief of this division, it is learned that there has been a
steady and very considerable growth in the library, and that satisfac-
tory progress has been made in the work of cataloguing. The facilities
for exchange have been increased, and the rapid growth of the library
is due almost entirely to this feature. Although no attempt is made to
80 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

stimulate sales of Survey publications, yet as they become better known
the desire for them becomes more general, and the sales during the pres-
ent fiscal year have amounted to double those of the previous year.

U. S. FISH COMMISSION.

As already explained, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
exercises the functions of chief officer of the U. S. Fish Commission,
for which, of course, he receives no salary. It has therefore been his
duty to report, year by year, what the Commission has been doing, and,
in its interest to the public service, to justify the action taken upon the
subject. ,

The history of the Commission, since its organization in 1871, has
shown a gradual expansion of scope and increase in magnitude, in pro-
portion to the increasing appropriations made by Congress. The ap-
propriation for the first year was $5,000, while for the year just closed
it amounts to nearly $250,000. The work, as heretofore, has been di-
vided mainly into two sections: one, the investigation of the statistics
and natural history of the fishes and other products of the water
and their relationships to each other, including the various methods of
capture and utilization, form of apparatus required, &c.; the other,
the increase in the supply of food fishes, &c., either by artificial prop-
agation or by transportation. The addition, within recent years, of
several vessels to the means of investigation on the part of the Com-
mission has been of great service, especially through the work of the
steamer Albatross. More recently, Congress has authorized the con-
struction of a small schooner of special device, to be used particularly
in securing the ripe parent sea fish at distant points and bringing them
to stations on the coast, especially to Wood’s Holl, Mass. This vessel,
although completed at the end of the fiscal year, is not yet in commis-
sion. An account of her work will therefore be deferred until the next
report.

Referring to the detailed accotat of operations in the Report of the

U. S. Fish Commission, it may be briefly stated that the usual researches
have been prosecuted during the year, resulting in the acquisition of a
Jarge amount of important information, which will be duly reported
upon at the appropriate time. Complete statistics of the fisheries of
the coast have been gathered for the service of the Government in the
international question arising between the United States and Canada;
and these have already been called for by the Congressional committees
of investigation.

As on several previous occasions, the services of the steamer Alba-
tross were secured by the Navy Department for the purpose of con-
tinuing hydrographic research in the Caribbean and West Indian seas,
and during the past year the vessel was assigned to labor off the Ba-

haman Islands, where she was engaged for several months in making
soundings, dredgings, temperature observations, &c.

The “ fish-culture” work of the Commission has also been earried on
on a very extensive scale, the different stations having all been engaged
in the work to the measure of their capacity, and many hundreds of
millions of eggs have been taken, hatched out, and distributed to va-
rious points, among them being whitefish, salmon, land-locked salmon,
California trout, brook trout, lake trout, grayling, Sia fresh-water her-
ring, codfish, Spanish Hbiceson Taetene, &e.

The principal station of the Commission—that at Wood’s Holl, Mass.—
has been adapted especially for the hatching of sea fish, chiefly of the
cod and of the lobster; and while considerable work has been done
there during the past winter, preparations have been under way through
the summer for the purpose of renewing the work on a wholesale scale
the coming winter.

The completion of the schooner Grampus now allows its use in bring-
ing spawning fish from the distant banks, and it is hoped that the in-
terruption last winter in the supply of parent fish will not again occur.

An additional function of the Wood’s Holl Station is that of furnish-
ing the means of biological investigation and research to specialists,
many of whom availed themselves of the advantages afforded them
during the past fiscal year.

Another subject that has largely occupied the attention of the Com-
mission of late years is the artificial production of the oyster, and ex-
periments already made have shown that the general principles of fish
culture may be applied to this animal to great advantage. Work in
this direction is now in progress at the sea-coast station at Saint Je-
rome’s, Md., near the mouth of the Potomac River, as well as at Wood’s
Holl, and with quite satisfactory results.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX TO THE SECRETARY’S. REPORT.

REPORT ON SMITHSONIAN EXCHANGES FOR THE FISCAL
YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1886.

By GrorGcE H. BOkHMER.

When, towards the close of the year 1589, you intrusted the charge
of the exchange service to my keeping, no very definite system had been
established, though the records kept may have been sufficient for the
extent of the business at that time.

As the work expanded I ventured to make some suggestions whereby
the service might be established on more business principles, involving
the organization of the Record, Foreign, Domestic, and Government
Exchange Divisions.

At present the office force is worked to its full capacity, and an in-
‘crease 1n the work would require a corresponding increase in the force.

The Record Division. —One of the improvements introduced in 1881
Was a System of card catalogues as ledger accounts, which has been
found very useful. We have at present 4,513 cards, representing the
accounts kept with societies ; and 3,340 cards, representing the accounts
with individuals.

These cards, arranged in geographical series (and under each coun-
try alphabetically), are numbered as in the “List of foreign corre-
spondents.” They represent a double-entry ledger, showing to the left
the books and packages received for the party represented, together
with the date of reception, transmission, and acknowledgment of re-
ceipt by the recipient, and to the right the nature and character of any
sending received from that party. The number of the page on which
each entry is recorded on the day-book and the number corresponding
to each item on the incoming or invoice book complete the record.

The manner of proceeding in posting the cards was fully deseribed
in the report for 1885, as also the duties of the (two) assistants em-

Foreign Exchange Division.—The operations of this division during
the year exceed those of any previous year, the receipts being 94,093
packages, with a weight of 195,404 pounds. These were shipped in
764 cases, representing a bulk of 5,208 cubic feet. A detailed state-
ment will be given in the general statistics, but a condensed table of
the receipts and transmissions in this division may not be without in-
terest :

The above table shows almost a doubling of the receipts and trans-
missions since the beginning of the present decade.

The work of this division is performed by two clerks and one packer.
Two temporary clerks have been employed so as not to interrupt the
regular transmissions during the sending off of the annual reports for
1883, but their services were discontinued upon accomplishment of the
work for which they were detailed.

Domestic. Exchange Division.—In this division, too, an increase of
about 20 per cent. over the work of the past two years is noticeable, the

*This includes 2,533 parcels addressed by mai] to the library of the Institution.

Government Hxchange Division.—This division is not fully established
yet, all the active work, the receiving and shipping, being performed by
the assistants of the Foreign Exchange Division. Only one clerk is
employed in recording the books delivered by the Public Printer; and
when not occupied with this work in assisting the foreign exchange
division by addressing labels or envelopes.

Twenty-nine boxes and 56,229 packages have been received and 114
boxes shipped in this division.

My own services during the year, in addition to the general super-
vision of the above work, have consisted in the writing of about 1,200
letters or memoranda for letters, including some extensive reports for
the use of the Joint Library Committee of Congress; the preparation of
a new list of foreign correspondents of about 4,000 titles; of a list of
existing astronomical observatories, American and foreign; of a paper
on Norske Naval Architecture for the Proceedings of the National
Museum and the translation of a paper on Observations of Volcanic
Eruptions and Earthquakes in Iceland, accompanied by a complete
bibliography on the subject for the Smithsonian annual report for 1885.

AGENCIES.

Transportation companies.—The rapid extension of the Smithsonian
exchanges soon became a heavy tax upon the resources of the Institu-
tion, and the conduet of its principal function (‘the increase of know-
ledge among men” by the promotion of original research and discovery)
was threatened with being crippled and overridden by the demands of
ed

a service regarded as incidental and subordinate thereto. With a view
to diminish, if possible, the expenses involved, the Institution, in 1855,
addressed several of the leading transatlantic steam-ship companies,
unfolding its methods, and asking, in consideration of the great public

_ benefit of the system, the favor of reduced rates of freight’ upon this

particular service.

With a liberality and publie spirit which can not be too highly ad-
mired, the companies addressed agreed to carry the freights of the
Smithsonian Institution net merely at an abatement, but without
charge, and thus generously enabled the Institution to maintain the
growing magnitude of the operations, when otherwise the system must
have broken down by its own weight.

The first privilege of free freight was extended during the year 1855
by the following companies:

United States Mail Steamship Company, M. O. Roberts, president.

Pacifie Mail Steamship Company, W. H. Aspinwall, president.

South American Mail Steamship Company, Juan Metteson, president.

Mexican Gulf Steamship Company, Harris & Morgan, agents.

Panama Railroad Company, David Hoadley, president.

California and Panama Steamship Company.

In 1857 the line of sailing vessels between New York and the west
coast of South America, belonging to Mr. Bartlett, 110 Wall street, also
engaged to carry all the Chilian exchanges free of freight.

Tn 1858 Hon. &. Schleiden, the minister from Bremen, offered his serv-
ices in trying to procure for the Smithsonian Institution the advantage
of free or reduced freight on exchanges for the port of Bremen, and he
announced his success in a letter, dated January 25, 1859, in which he
said :

It affords me great pleasure now to inform you that, according to a
letter of the president of the Lloyd, dated the 5th instant and just re-
ceived, the said Bremen Steamship Company (Nerth German Lloyd)
have resolved henceforth, and until further notice, to forward by their
steamers ali the packages of books and specimens of natural history
which the Smithsonian Institution may be pleased to send to Germany,
or which may be sent from Germany to the Smithsonian Institution,
free of charges between New York and Bremerhaven.

The North Atlantic Steamship Company (J.W. Raymond) aiso granted
free freight in 1859.

On the 25th of February, 1860, in reply to a request of Professor
Henry, of the 16th of February, Mr. Cunard, of the Cunard Line of
Steamers, replied :

I beg to inform you that I shall have much pleasure in conveying in
our steamers from New York to Liverpool, every fortnight, one or more
cases from the Smithsonian Institution to the extent of half a ton, or 20
cubic feet measurement; the cases to be addressed to your agent in
Liverpool, or to his care. The arrangement of free cases is intended
only to apply to those shipped by you from this side of the water.

in response to an application, the Hamburg-American Packet

Company, in a letter of Messrs. Kunhardt & Co., dated New York, Octo-
ber 21, 1861, granted for their line of steamers the privilege of free
freight, be they specimens of natural history, books, or other articles,
irrespective of bulk.

The privilege of free freight was furthermore accorded the Smithson-
ian Institution by the following-named companies :

Foreign Centers of Distribution.—In carrying on the exchanges of the

Smithsonian Institution it was necessary to appoint a number of agents,
and authority for this was given by the Board of Regents in their meet-
ing of February 27, 1851, when, on motion of Mr. Bache, it was resolved,
“That the secretary be authorized to appoint an agent abroad to con-
duct the exchanges of the Iastitution.

The agencies established were:

Hector Bossange, Paris, France; for France, Italy, Spain, and Portu-
gal.

Dr. John G. Fliigel, United States consul at Leipsig, Germany ; for
the rest of continental Europe except Turkey and Greece.

Henry Stevens, of London, England ; for England, Scotand, and Ite-
land.

The Hon. George P. Marsh, United States minister at Constantino-
ple, took charge of exchanges for Turkey, Greece, and northern Africa,
and the United States consals at other places undertook, in most cases,
to transact the business free of charge, only the actual expenses being
refunded.
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 97

These avencies being established, other exchanges could be carried
on through them, and the means of conveyance, at the slight additional
expense owing to the increase of freight.

The duties of the agents of exchange consisted in the distribution of
all the parcels sent them by the Smithsonian Institution and the receiv-
ing and transmitting of return exchanges, together with any information
which the Institution might desire, and their duties with an increase of
the service became so great as to justify the recommendation of an in-
crease of salary, most especially in the case of Dr. Fliigel, in Leipsig,
which recommendation was granted by the Board of Regents in their
meetings of May 1, 1852, and February 12, 1853. In 1854 the secretary
had again occasion to remark on the foreign agencies as follows:

J would beg to call your attention to the zeal and fidelity with
which the agents of the Institution in London, Leipsig, and Paris have
discharged their duties. The thanks of the Institution are most espe-
cially due to Dr. Fliigel, of Leipsig, whose efforts in the great cause of
tightening the bonds of union between the literary and scientific men
and institutions of the two worlds are beyond all praise.

In 1855 the Institution was informed of the death of its agent in
Leipsig, Dr. Fliigel. On this occasion Professor Henry, the Secretary of
the Institution expressed himself:

It becomes my duty to announce the loss which the Institution has
experienced in the death of one of its warmest friends and most active
agents, Dr. J. G. Fliigel. After a residence of several years in this
country he returned to Germany as United States consul, in which
capacity he was unremitting in his efforts to render service to Ameri-
can travelers, and by his untiring industry and zeal in behalf of the In-
stitution contributed more than any other person to make it known
through northern and central Europe. His son, Dr. Felix Fliigel, has
been appointed his successor, and has evineed a desire and given evi-
dence of his ability to carry on the system with promptness and effi-
ciency.

In 1861 the Royal Society of London attended to the distribution and
collection of packages for and from Great Britain and Ireland.

In 1862 Mr. William Wesley, of London, was appointed agent for
Great Britain and Ireland.

In 1863 Mr. Frederick Miiller, of Amsterdam, was appointed agent for
Holland and Belgium.

In 1865 the firm of Hector Bossange changed to Gustave Bossange
& Co.

In 1867 the Hon. George P. Marsh consented to take charge of ex-
changes between the United States and Italy, and the duty of distribu-
tion and collecting of parcels was assumed by the Imperial Royal In-
stitute of Milan. |

In 1868 the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences assumed charge of
the agency for Sweden, the Royal University of Christiania for Norway,
and the Royal Academy of Sciences of Copenhagen for Denmark,

H. Mis. 170 -——7
98 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

In 1869 the University of Melbourne, Victoria, offered to receive and
distribute exchanges for Australia and New Zealand, and a bureau of
international exchanges was established by the Government of the United
States of Colombia in Bogota.

In 1871 the following were added to the list of Smithsonian exchange
agencies :

L. Watkins & Co., St. Petersburg, for Russia.

Royal Academy of Sciences, Lisbon, for Portugal.

Royal Academy of Sciences, Madrid, for Spain.

Parliamentary Library, Wellington, for New Zealand.

Mr. William Wesley, London, England, for the English colonies in
Asia and Africa.

In 1873 the Royal Institute of Milan intrusted Mr. Ulrico Hoepli, of
Milan, with the work of exchanges, and he assumed the duties of the
Smithsonian agency.

In 1874 Prof. B. H. von Baumhauer, of the Scientific Institute of Har-
lem, offered his services for Holland, which were accepted by the Insti-
tution.

In 1876 the representatives of the various Australian colonial govern-
ments, at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia, arranged for dis-
tributing and collecting agencies in their colonies: New South Wales,
New Zealand, Queensland, South Australia, Tasmania, and Victoria,
respectively.

The Hidgenossensche Bundes-Canzlei, Bern, Switzerland ;

The Museo Nacional, Mexico City, Mexico;

The Universidad, Santiago, Chili;

The Museo Ptiblico, Buenos Ayres, Argentine Republic;

The Minister of foreign affairs, Port au Prince, Hayti;

The Minister of foreign affairs, Tokio, Japan ;

The University of Caracas, Venezuela;
as recipients of Government exchanges, assumed the duties of’ col-
lecting and distributing Smithsonian exchanges.

Dr. Felipe Poey, for the university at Havana, Cuba, and the Geo-
logical Survey of Canada, in Montreal, volunteered their services as
agents.

In 1877 the agency in Lisbon, Portugal, was changed from the Royal
Academy of Sciences to the Escola Polytechnica, and the Bibliotheque
Nationale, of Athens, Greece, as recipient of the official publications,
assumed the duties of a distributing agency.

In 1878 the Smithsonian Institution availed itself, in its scientific¢
and literary intercourse with Belgium, France, Brazil, Italy, Russia,
and Switzerland, of the following agencies, appointed by their respect-
ive governments in compliance with the stipulations of the exchange
convention of Paris, in 1875:

Belgium, Commission Belge des Echanges Inteznationazx, Brussels.

In 1884 the Argentine Republic established an office for the deposit
and distribution of official publications, which, however, has not yet
been employed by the Smithsonian Institution as agency, its exchanges
still being in the hands of Professor Burmeister, of the Public Museum,
where they were placed in 1876. Arrangements were also effected by
me during my official visit in London with the Crown agents of the
colonies to take charge of the Smithsonian exchanges for all the colo-
nies under their immediate charge.

In 1885, by the death of Professor von Baumhauer, of Harlem, Hol-
land, the agency for Holland was placed it the hands of Dr. Toek, of
Leiden. The Government of Uruguay established an exchange bureau
in Montevideo.

In 1886 the agencies of the Smithsonian Institution are found in
every part of the civilized globe. The following is a complete list of

GOVERNMENT DOCUMENTS.

The first action by Congress relating to an international exchange of
official publications was a joint resolution, July 20, 1840 (Statutes at
Large, vol. v, p. 509), authorizing the Librarian of Congress, under the
direction of the Committee on the Library, “to exchange such dupli-
cates as may be in the library for other books,” and to exchange, in the
same manner, public documents, of which “ fifty additional copies” were
ordered to be printed for the purpose. Supplementary acts were passed
March 4, 1846; June 26, 1848; June 30, 1848; March 2, 1849; August
31, 1852; August 18, 1856; March 2, 1867.

The last Congressional action was taken on July 25, 1868, in the fol-
lowing terms:

“(No. 72) A resolution to carry into effect the resolution approved March
2, 1867, providing for the exchange of certain public documents.

** Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States in Congress assembled, That the Congressional Printer, whenever
he shall be so directed by the Joint Committee on the Library, be, and

*The apparent decrease in the cost of exchanges for the fiscal year 1885—86 is due
to the re-imbursement during that year of a check for $2,498 lost in the mails in the
year 188425. It was charged to the first six months of 1885, and thus increases the
cost of exchanges for that period and diminishes that for the year 1885-86 by credit
for re-imbursement.
102 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

he hereby is, directed to print fifty copies, in addition to the regular
number, of all documents hereafter printed by order of either house of
Congress, or by order of any Department or Bureau of the Government,
and: whenever he shail be so directed by the Joint Committee on the
Library one hundred copies additional of all documents ordered to be
printed, in excess of the usual number; said fifty or one hundred copies
to be delivered to the Librarian of Congress, to be exchanged, under
direction of the Joint Committee on the Library, as provided by joint
resolution approved March 2, 1867.”

“Section 2. And be it fur ther resolved, That 50 copies of each publi-
cation printed under the direction of any Department or Bureau of the
Government, whether at the Congressional printing office or elsewhere,
shall be placed at the disposal of the Joint Committee on the L ibrary,
to carry out the provision of said resolution.”

By this joint resolution fifty extra copies are ordered from the Publie
Printer of all executive as well as Congressional documents, including,
Ist. The Congressional issue, journals, committee reports, and miscel-
laneous documents; 2d. The Annual Reports of the Executive Depart-
ments and the several Bureaus; and 3d. The Memoirs, Monographs,
and Special Reports published by the Executive Departments and the
several Bureaus.

Owing to the failure of the Public Printer to comply with those por-
tions of the law relating to the second and third series of the United
States official publications—the annual reports and the memoirs, mono-
graphs, and special reports published by the Executive Departments
and Bureaus of the Government (although occasionally some few of
the works of these classes have been received)—a circular letter was
addressed by the Smithsonian Institution on the 15th of February, 1884,
to all the Departments and Bureaus of the Government, soliciting co-
operation in compliance with the existing laws, so as to enable the Insti-
tution, as agent of the Government, to carry out the provisions of the
Congressional resolutions.

Among the replies received that of the honorable Secretary of State
Says:

‘““T have ventured to suggest to the Joint Committee on the Library
the desirability of a permanent provision for the printing of these de-
sired copies.”

On March 7, 1884, Professor Baird addressed a communication to the
Hon. John Sherman, chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library,
suggesting:

‘*{ would therefore ask you respectfully to consider the several enact-
ments upon the subject of international exchange with which this In-
stitution is charged, and that such supplementary legislation be pro-
vided as will enable us to surmount the difficulties referred to.”

Appended to this letter a list was given of the more important doc-
uments not furnished to the Smithsonian Institution, although they are
included in the series included by Congress for exchange purposes.

Among such documents the following may be mentioned (assuming

REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 103

Series I, the Congressional issue, as delivered complete, although even
herein too many deficiencies occur):

Series Il. Lhe Annual Reports of the Executive Departments and bu-
reaus of the Government, together with the papers accompanying such
reports (section 3796, Revised Statutes, and resolution 72, second session
Fortieth Congress.

Series IIT. The Memoirs, Monographs, or Special Reports published by
the Executive Departments or Bureaus of the Government, whether
printed at the Government Printing Office or elsewhere (section 2, res-
olution 72, second session Fortieth Congress).

This last series comprises, among many others, the following most
valuable publications:

Patent Office.
Official Gazette.
Specitications and Drawings.
Growth of Industrial Art.

Of this last-named work only fifty copies were printed, although the
law (section 2, resolution 72, second session Fortieth Congress, Statutes
at ‘Large, Vol. XV, p. 261) distinctly provides that ‘ fifty copies of each
publication - - - whether printed at the Congressional Printing
Office or elsewhere, shall be placed at the disposal of the Joint Com-
mittee.”

U.S. Geological Survey.
Bulletins.
Monographs.

A letter was addressed to the Director of the Geological Survey Feb-
ruary 15, 1884, claiming fifty copies of all the publications of that office
for exchange purposes under the law. In reply, the Director stated,
February 26, 1884:

‘ Under the law of Mareh 2, 1867, fifty copies of everything published
by us should be sent to the Library of Congress and thence to the Smith-
sonian Institution, by the Public Printer, and such copies are reserved
for that purpose and do not come into our possession.

Under the statutes relating to the publication of the Monographs of
the Survey it would be impossible to spare any copies from the three
thousand received by this office, from the fact that it is necessary for
the Survey to render an account of its publications, either as sold, ex-
changed, or on hand.”

Tenth Census of the United States.
Monographs.

Not a single volume of these has been reeeived under Section III of
the Government publications, as prescribed by law.
Fish Commission.

Bulletins, volumes 1 to 5.
State Department.
Consular Reports.
Of these only the numbers 1 to 22 have been received.
104 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

Coast and Geodetic Survey.
Publications.
American and Foreign Claims Commissions.

As those relating to France, Hayti, Spain, the Alabama, ete., none
of which has been received; nor in fact any of the publications of the
Departments and Bureaus of the Government.

No action having been had on the subject, a further request was ad-
dressed to the Library Committee on the 21st of September, 1885,
and again to the Hon. W.J. Sewell, Chairman of the Joint Library
Jommittee, on the 18th of January, 1886, and although no definite
result has yet been accomplished, it is to be hoped that Congress,
through the Library Committee, may take such action as will secure
to the Smithsonian Institution, as the agent of the Government, fifty
copies of each of the three distinct series specified in the acts of March
2, 1867, and July 25, 1868, so as to enable the Government, to obtain
for its Library the entire fruit of the wise provision of Congress in es-
tablishing this exchange of official public documents.

INTERNATIONAL PROCEEDINGS.

The Brussels Convention on International Hachanges.

As a result of the proceedings of the conference held at Brussels in
April, 1883, a draft of articles of agreement was adopted, to be submit-
ted to the contracting powers for final ratification, as already set forth
in the annual report on exchanges for 1883. The date appointed for
this ratification was March 15, 1886, and the further proceedings in the
matter are fully exhibited by the following correspondence with the
Department of State:

From the Secretary of State, March 3, 1886, to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution.

Str: I have the honor to transmit to you herewith, for your informa-
tion and consideration, a translation of a note from the minister of Bel-
gium at this capital, notifying this Government that the diplomatic
conference for the signing of the convention relative to the international
exchange of official documents and of scientific and literary publica-
tions will meet at the ministry of foreign affairs at Brussels on Monday,
the 15th day of the present month.

I should be pleased to have your views as to the expediency of this
Government becoming a party to the convention in question.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,
-T. F. BAYARD.

From the Belgian minister at Washington, February 18, 15886, to the Sec-
retary of State.

Mr. SECRETARY OF STATE: [I have the honor to inform your excel-
leney that the diplomatic conference for the signing of the conventions
relative to the international exchange of official documents and of sci-
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. LO5

entific and literary publications will meet at the ministry of foreign
affairs at Brussels on Monday, the 15th day of Mareh next, at 2 o’clock.

Belgium, Brazil, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Servia, and Switzerland have
adopted the arrangement drafted by the conference of 1883 for general
exchanges. (Protocol A.)

Switzerland has not adhered to Draft B, concerning the direct and
immediate transmission to the legislative chambers of the Official Jour-
nal and of the reports of Parliamentary proceedings. That special con-
vention will, however, be concluded by all the other States that I have
just named.

Your excellency had the kindness to inform me. under date of Octo-
ber 16, 1885, that you had not yet reached a decision on this subject, but
that, meanwhile, you reserved to the Government of the United States
of America the privilege of adhering thereafter.

My Government hopes that the United States Government will be
represented at that conference and has instructed me to make inquiry
of your excellency’s intentions in this matter. I shall therefore be
grateful to you if you will have the kindness to make me acquainted
with them as soon as may be convenient.

It is proper for me to add that Greece and Roumania have likewise
just been requested to communicate their-intentions.

I gladly avail myself of this occasion to renew to your excellency the
assurances of my highest consideration.

THEO. DE BOUNDER DE MELSBROECK.

From the Smithsonian Institution, March 5, 1886, to the Secretary of
State.

Str: Your letter of the 3d instant is received, but owing to the short
notice given us of the proposed diplomatic conference for “the signing
of conventions relative to the international exchange of official docu-
ments and scientific and literary publications,” to be held at Brussels on,
as you state, March 15, we are unable to meet definitely or in detail your
invitation for our *‘ views as to the expediency of this Government be-
coming a party to the conference in question.”

We beg to say, however, that the Smithsonian Institution, as the
agent for international exchange on the part of the United States, will
be happy to comply with the stipulations ef the conferences as far as
may be in its power, including the sending of daily reports of Congres-
sional proceedings to the several governments.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution.

Sir: I have the honor to transmit to you, herewith, a copy of a dis
patch to this Department from Mr. Tree, our minister at Brussels, con-
cerning the two conventions, A and B, for the exchange of public docu-
ments, “which were signed by him on the 15th ultimo.

I beg to inquire whether you have any views to make known before
the conventions are submitted to the Senate with a view to their ratifi-
cation.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

which were inclosed with your letters of April 9 and 17, I beg to state
that, upon mature consideration, | have no further suggestions to make
as to the acceptance of the terms proposed at the Brussels Conference.

T entertain the view, however, that the expectations of the Belgian
Government in proposing exchange relations beyond those at present
existing will be but indifferently realized, since all the prominent gov-
ernments have declined to participate in its propositions, only those of
Spain, Italy, Portugal, Servia, and Belgium, of European, and the United
States and Br azil, of American nations, having expressed a desire to
ratify the convention.

The Smithsonian Institution, as agent of the Government of the United
States for the exchange of its officis ial publications, having thus far ob-
tained satisfactery results by de ling individually with governments
whose publications are desirable, it would appear to me doubtful
whether additional benefits could be derived by adhesion to a treaty
with a few of the more unimportant governments of Europe.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CORRESPONDENCE WITH THE ARGENTINE REPUBLIC.

in acceptance, on the part of the Argentine Government, of the terms
of exchange proposed by the Smithsonian Institution on behalf of the
Government of the United States, the first transmission for that country,
of six boxes, was made on November 18, 1875, through the Argentine
ambassador, Mr. G. Videla Dorna, in New York.

In 1576 an application for a set of these official publications for the
Government of the province of Buenos Ayres was favorably considered,
and on November 21,1876, the first installment of seven boxes forwarded
to its destination. Bou sets have since been increased to twenty-six
boxes each.

On November 25, 1854, Mr. Marcus I’. Gutiérez, director of the office
for the deposit and distribution of the Baoneanicne of the Argentine
Government in Buenos Ayres, addressed the Smithsonian Institution
with the request for a copy of the United States official publications
for deposit in his office.

On December 18, 1884, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
replied that the official Banncanaes i the United States are already
represented in two copies in the city of Buenos Ayres, and regretting
his inability of furnishing a third copy.

On October 20, 1885, Mr. Gutiérez addressed to the Smithsonian In-
stitution a letter of which the following is a translation:

Str: The undersigned, director of the office for the deposit and dis-
tribution of the public: ations of this Government, has the honor to ad-
dress to you a copy of the Superior Decree of July 25, A. C., specify-
ing the rules and regulations adopted by his excellency the Minister
of Justice, Worship, and Public Instruction, Dr. Edward Wilde, for
the government of this office, which is to promote the international ex-
change of publications.

From this decree you will learn the conditions under which this office
can undertake the exchange of publications with governments, libraries,
and foreign establishments, and if these are agreeble to you I would
thank you for your opinion how this exchange is best to be instituted.
It is hoped that this arrangement will result in a full and mutually

valuable exchange of the intellectual productions of our respective
countries.

BY a Waran
Attest :
JUAN IGARZABAL.

In a second letter of the same date (October 20, 1885) Mr. Gutiérez
announces the sending of publications. ‘A delay was caused,” he con-
tinued, ‘“‘by the difficulties inherent in a newly created office; more-
over, ! desire to make the sending of some importance to correspond in
a measure with your kindness.”

On the 26th December, 1835, the Secretary of the Institution replied

’ ) J I
to Mr. Gutiérez :

Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communi-
cations of October 20, 1885, and to say that we await with pleasure the
receipt of the important sending to which you refer, on the part of the
Argentine Republic, in return for the official publications of the United
States Government, of which two sets have been contributed to Buenos
Ayres, one for the Government of the Republic, and one for the govern-
ment of the Province.

I am, your obedient servant,
. fH. DATED:

CORRESPONDENCE WITH AUSTRIA-HUNGARY.

From the Smithsonian Institution, October 12,1855, to Count Lippe Weiss

enfels, chargé Waffaires of Austria-Hungary.

Sir: On October 9, 1884, Mr. George H. Boehmer, a delegate of the
Smithsonian Institution, the authorized agent of the Government of the
United States, had the honor of being introduced by the United States
embassador in Vienna, to his excelleney the Count Sz6e gyenyl, first
section chief in the i. Rh. foreign office, for the purpose of arranging for
an exchange of official public documents between the Government of the
United States and the Imperial Government of Austria.

His excellency the Count Szégyenyi being favorably impressed with
the proposition of such ex cchange placed the preliminary steps of ar-
rangements into the hands of M. de Plason, a councilor in the foreign
office with whom the Smithsonian representative was placed in commu-
nieation. After various consultations with this gentleman, Mr. Boehmer
was officially introduced by the foreign office to the chiefs of the vari-
ous departments of the Imperial Government, most of whom were fav-
orably inclined conditionally to enter into an exchange on the proposed
basis.

The exchange proposed by the Smithsonian Institution includes all
publications made by Congressional order since January 1, 1868, and
comprises the parliamentary proceedings, projects at law, reports, and
scientific works of the departments and bureaus of the Government,
110 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

representing at present a bulk of twenty-three boxes of about 64 eubic
feet each, with a total weight of about 5,500 pounds.

These works, the titles of which are specified in the accompanying
documents, have been offered in one copy, for deposit in one general
library, as a complete set of the United States publications as ordered
printed by Congress, and an equally exhaustive return has been asked
for from the Imperial Government.

While now the chiefs of the various departments approve of the estab-
lishment of exchange relations, there is a tendency among them to dis-
card a centralization of the works, and rather express a desire of each
selecting from the books thus offered such as may be of interest and
value to their respective departments, and in exchange for such they
are willing to make equivalent returns.

While now, on the part of the United States Government, no special
objection could be had to such a distribution of their documents, such
course would have a tendency of complicating matters, and require of
some works a number of copies to supply the demands made for them
by various departments all equally interested in the acquisition of any
particular work, while the Smithsonian Institution as agent of the Gov-
ernment, can, under the law, only offer one single copy.

Furthermore, there has been in existence for a number of years an
independent exchange between corresponding departments and bureaus
of the two nations, and many documents have been received by them
and thereby render a division of the documents to be received under
the proposed exchange unnecessary; neither has the Smithsonian In-
stitution, as the agent of the Government, the power of discriminating
which of the books to send, but is compelled to furnish one copy of
every document received to any of the contracting powers.

From these considerations the Smithsonian Institution could not pos-
sibly consent to the proposition made by the chiefs of the respective de-
partments, to select from the list of works such as may be of interest to
the department, but we would have to send one complete collection to
the foreign office, or any place of deposit designated by the Imperial
Government for the reception of the publications, to be distributed as
may be deemed most advantageous by the Imperial Government.

All this was stated by Mr. Boehmer in his conferences with M. de
Plason, and the suggestion made by him that the individual exchange
now existing between the corresponding bureaus be continued uninter-
ruptedly, while the foreign office charge itself with the collecting, from
the various bureaus of the e Imperial Government, of one copy each of
their respective publications in direct response to the system of ex-
changes to be inaugurated between the Governments.

In acceptance by the Imperial] Government of a former proposition of
the United States Government, the first two boxes of books had already
been sent to Vienna in 1875, where e they were deposited in the Imper ial
library, but further sendings were declined by the librarian as too bulky
and incomplete. The bulk of valuable books should be a rather favora-
ble consideration for a librarian, while completenesscan not be expected
in the contents of two boxes of official publications from various delays
which may occur daring the process of issue.

Another point of disagreement in the establishment of the proposed
SEM: relation is found in the transmission of exchange boxes,

CORRESPONDENCE WITH GREAT BRITAIN.

From the Department of State, April 16, 13886, to the Smithsonian Institu-
tion.

Sir: Application having been made through our legation at London
for certain publications of this Government for the use of the library of
the British Museum, I have the honor to request you to inform this
Department as to the practical working of the exchange of Government
publications between this country and Great Britain. Information is
particularly desired as to whether or not the publications of the British
Government are received regularly in exchange for those of our Gov-
ernment which are sent to London; and also as to what library or
libraries in Great Britain receive the publications of this Government
which are forwarded to that country through the exchange bureau of
the Smithsonian Institution.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,
Tf. Ey BAYARD:

From the Smithsonian Institution, April 22, 1886, to the Secretary of
State.

Sirk: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
the 16th instant, relative to an application made by the British Museum
in London for certain publications of the United States Government
and requesting information as to the practical working of the exchange
of official publications between this coantry and England, and as to
the number of copies of official publications sent through the exchange
bureau of the Smithsonian Institution to libraries in Great Britain.

In reply I beg to state that the Smithsonian Institution, on behalf of
the United States Government, has sent to the British Gov ernment a
full series of all the documents ‘ordered to be printed by order of either
House of Congress and beginning with the Ist of January, 1868, as spec-
ified in the accompanying pamphlets. By direction of Lord Granville
all transmissions are made to the British Museum.

In addition to these official publications the Smithsonian Institution
has furnished the British Museum with the following series of its own
publications: Contributions to Knowledge, vols. 1 to25; Miscellaneous
Collections, vols. 1 to 27; annual Reports, 1846 to 1883; annual Reports,
Bureau of Ethnology, vols. 1 to 3; Proceedings of the National Mu-
seum, vols. 1 to 7; Bulletins of the National Museum, Nos. 1 to 27.

And tothe natural history division of the British Museum: Contribu-
tions to Knowledge, vols. 1 to 25; Miscellaneous Collections, vols. i to 27;
annual Reports, 1851 to 1885; Bulletins National Museum, Nos. 1 to 27.

The returns on the part of the British Museum have been confined to
the series of its own publications, which are sent in two copies for the
libraries of the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum, respect-

ively.
2 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

On the part of the British Govern ment the promise of a complete set
of English publications for the use of the United States Government
was made by Lord Granville on the 20th of Mareh, 1883, in a letter to
Mr. Lowell, in which he refers to former correspondence on the subject.
The publications offered are:

(1) Papers of all kinds printed for or presented to either house of
Parliament.

(2) Historical, scientific, or antiquarian works published by the Gov-
ernment, such as record publications.

(3) Maps or charts published by the Government.

(4) Departmental publications which are placed on sale.

In 1883 the Seeretary of the Smithsonian Institution, on behalf of the
Librarian of Congress, made application to the British Government
through the Department of State for certain works required to fill de-
ficiencies in the series on file in the Congressional Library. This re-
quest was granted by the lords of Her Majesty’s treasury, who di-
rected the superintendent of Her Majesty’s stationery office in London
to deliver the same as far as possible to the agent of the Smithsonian
Institution. These were received by Mr. George H. Boehmer, the gen-
tleman in charge of the exchange division of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, in November, 1884, on occasion of a visit to London on exchange
business. These, together with a few volumes of the Challenger Ex-
pedition reports, form the only publications received from the British
Government in exchange for the official documents sent by the United
States Government.

A second set of United States official publications was ordered by my
predecessor, the late Prof. Joseph Henry, on the 6th of December, 1876,
to be sent to the Royal Society of Edinburg, Scotland. These sendings,
comprising eleven boxes, were discontinued in 1878.

If the negotiations now pending should be concluded to the satisfac-
tion of the United States Government, the continuation of this set, now
representing fifteen boxes, might be placed at the disposal of the British

yovernment for use in the library of the House of Lords or that of the
House of Commons.
I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,
S. F. Barrp.
