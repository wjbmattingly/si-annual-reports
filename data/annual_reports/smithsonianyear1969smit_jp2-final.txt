The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846
in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson, of England,
who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America
“to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.” In receiving the property and accepting the trust, Con-
gress determined that the federal government was without authority to
administer the trust directly, and, therefore, constituted an “‘establish-
ment,” whose statutory members are “the President, the Vice President,
the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive departments.”

N AN AGE OF FRAGMENTATION, when there seem to be more nations
I and nationalities than ever before, when scientists and artists alike
are concerned with myriad specialties and subsects, how may the
Smithsonian live up to its mandate? There are curious countervailing
currents at large in the world today. On the one hand the knowledge
of things—technological and scientific—is growing exponentially and
forcing all of us apparently to live more and more in an homogenized
state as we become universally more dependent on our crutches, in-
dustrial and private power, communications and transportation. On
the other hand the spirit of independence, of “doing your own thing”
at all levels from individuals to communes, tribes and on to nations, is
having a strong revival. Beyond producing discontent and tension, will
these antagonistic currents finally clash, or will they seek out an integra-
tive middle course? Can man live with himself and still be part of a
world community?

At the Smithsonian we seek to study and hope to explain areas
which can increase man’s knowledge of his environment as well as his
knowledge of himself. From the point of view of environment the single
most important need of humans today is a grasp of the patterns, the
functioning of ecosystems, the total environmental milieu in any one of
our major climatic zones. On this understanding our physical future
depends.

The nature of man continues to evade definition, although we seem
to come closer each year. It is worth pointing out in this regard, as
Jaryl Haskins, the President of the Carnegie Institution, did recently,
that man’s innate mental equipment is still superior to any known
computer and that no one has been able to invent a single interlocking
system with as many as ten billion discrete units, or the equivalent of
the neural potential of a single human brain.

In many ways this Institution’s history of research and study has been
elping to set the stage for some of the most engrossing and enthralling
chievements of the present. Let us at least as Americans take credit
or some triumphs in this age of questioning and confusion. We can
ingle out one supreme feat of the past year, the flight around the
oon—the dawn of a new age—followed in July by a very tangible

1
D SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

triumph indeed. That prescient moment this past year was the one dur-
ing which perhaps half the world’s human population watched, in ap-
parently full realization of what was happening, while a foot in a clumsy
shoe and then a leg encased in wrappings, but obviously a human leg,
emerged from the bulky shadows in the television screen, and edged
its way downward into bright light toward what moonground,
grayish-white and staring as if in some deathly lamplight. The light—
twenty times brighter than that we see at the time of the full moon—
was earthlight. And so man touched the lunar surface and the rest of
us saw it and felt it palpably. Through the astronauts all of us have’
now somehow touched the moon.

There was a new truth in all this besides the touch, the contact. That
was the screen. It was more real to watch it than to read about it.
We are perhaps in the beginning of an age when the printed word
will suddenly be less like holy writ. All of us have been brought up to
believe printed words. From the Bible, or religious writing of some so
right on, we are educated to believe what we read. In the welter of
ignorance in which we exist, we still feel that to obtain facts one only
need use his training, and so we read history as written by historians, and
we read newspapers for instant facts. We use words in the same way,
words like “war,” “love,” and “country.” We use words like “environ-
ment,” “race,” and “enemy,” and we think they have a meaning even
though they are incapable of providing one to our senses. When we use
such words—even though they are mere ideas or generalities—and
when we believe exactly what we read we are proving a rather sad
point about education and textbooks today, namely that, as Jules Henry
puts it, much of education serves to confirm us in a state of legitimate
social stupidity. It is hard to conceive of this as a goal of education.
even though Henry appears to believe this is all some sort of plot.
At the same time, constant repetition of slogan phrases—like so many
steg heils—as well as the numbing belief that what we read is true
even if our senses tell us otherwise, does tend to create a penumbra,
a twilight zone in which the reassurances of conformity can dwell.

When they turned homeward the astronauts affirmed that our planet
earth had a warm and receptive look. Not only was it this earth of ours,
“this precious stone set in a silver sea,” but it was the only planet around
which looked colorful and homey. Home is the hunter, home from
outer space. Neil Armstrong reminded us in a moving phrase that the
effect of that noble adventure for him had been to generate the hope
that as man sets out to know more about space, he may come in the
process to learn somewhat more about himself.

In this moment of shared pride and renewed dedication, we of the
Smithsonian have our own small part. We can identify ourselves as

b
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 3

concerned with the origins of this whole vast achievement. Charles D.
Walcott, fourth Secretary of the Smithsonian, worked for the passage
of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics enabling act of
1915, served as Chairman of its first executive committee until 1917, and
as a member of the committee until his death in 1927. The National
Advisory Committee was transformed into the National Air and Space
Administration in 1958. From such small beginnings, organized by Wal-
cott as a mark of scientific respect to his predecessor, former Secretary
Samuel P. Langley, have sprung the whole vast panoply of NAsa—this
creator of the “Spirit of Appollo” as President Nixon has termed it.

We live in a biological universe, that of the earth, and so far as we
know it is the only one we will ever live in. Our own age of enlighten-
ment, our own mastery of facts as distinct from ideals or slogans, has
shown us that everything in the cosmos—from heavenly bodies to
human beings—has developed and continues to develop through evo-
lutionary processes. Thus theoretical biology now pervades all of west-
ern culture indirectly through the concept of progressive historical
change. Man and his culture have evolved simultaneously, certainly
after some finite point, if not before. Increases in brain size must have
occurred simultaneously with the unfolding of patterns of social behav-
ior. Primitive forms of art, of religion and even forms of scientific dis-
covery also must have played their part in affecting the development of
neural processes and capacity, and their integration. New reaction pat-
terns provide physiological adaptations to man’s own evolving culture.
What would seem to be almost certain is that the various components
of human culture are now required, not only for the survival of man
but also for his existential realization. In our biological universe, man’s
continuing evolution helps create his evolving culture, and thereby the
two become interdependent, even as they continue to evolve.

A truism in evolutionary studies is the presence of diversity at all
levels of systems. In this past year, the Smithsonian opened the first Na-
tional Portrait Gallery, a long-awaited event, achieved only with the will-
willing cooperation of some of the Nation’s great art galleries, and
friendly private collectors, for famous portrait paintings have long since
been gathered up largely into state and local historical collections or pri-
vate institutions. The successful opening exhibition of the Gallery was
centered around the theme—what is the American, this man evolved in a
New Land? What is this new creation, this “promiscuous breed,” as
Oscar Handlin called Americans in his introduction to the catalogue of
the exhibition? Only a few were left out in this rich brew of portraits.
There were few poor men, no beggarmen to speak of, and perhaps only
a thief or two.
4 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

But the exhibition did give a clue to the student of populations. A
variety of disparate types of populations, set down in a variety of hetero-
geneously diverse environments, has demonstrated another truism in
evolution theory. Even though the original individuals may have sepa-
rate origins, there is a tendency for a continuing interplay both within
and without, so that segregated, small groups tend to develop small
cultural as well as physical resemblances. These resemblances aggregate
into regional resemblances. These last may eventually aggregate into
traits of culture, or character, which do in fact produce recognizable
characteristics. So subspecies are born, of geographical isolation, and
resulting cultural and physical resemblances in spite of a wide diversity
of original genetic combinations. At the same time other changing
influences may be at work to break down and recombine these combi-
nations, and so the melting pot continually forms and reforms, blending
and blurring the evolving differences.

Looking at this splendid panorama of Americans, one does receive an
impression that at least in past years our people had developed a certain
series of recognizable types with regional overtones. The New Eng-
lander has some shared resemblances with northeasterners. The south-
eastern mountains have their types, and the Texans are characteristic
with shared resemblances to the southwest in general. The differing
nationalities have preserved many of their customs as well as certain
morphological minor differences. Racial differences seem to have been
on a submerging course. Indian tribes have been slowly and steadily
losing their distinctness, sometimes stampeding themselves in the race
to be like everyone else. Negroes, following the predictions of Raymond
Pearl, have been gradually integrating and assimilating themselves into
the rest of the general population, especially in cities as they migrated
from the farms until recently. Now it remains to be seen if this gradual
evolutionary process can be arrested by a conscious effort of will by
racists among the blacks. Our great new National Portrait Gallery, so
ably started under the direction of Charles Nagel, and now to be con-
tinued under his talented successor, Marvin Sadik, is thus a scholarly
resource for the other branches of the Smithsonian in history and
anthropology as well as in portraiture. Its exhibits and its collections
extend in cross currents throughout the Institution.

In the meantime it would seem as if a portrait gallery or any art mu-
seum is in some ways more closely akin to what people accept nowadays
as the new inculcation by television, than it is to the previous learning by
reading and writing. Perhaps TV and museums are more closely allied
than we think. The new generation’s familiarity with ingestion by TV
may serve to habituate them to museum-like education. If this be so,
let us hope that museums realize it before someone else takes them over.
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 5

The two basic themes which can be demonstrated in a museum setting
are perhaps central to our survival on our homey planet. On the one
hand there is man’s evolving culture, so closely tied in with man’s own
physical evolution. That culture can be demonstrated more effectively
by the use of objects than in almost any other way. And it is that very
culture which plays such a fundamental role in our second great theme,
man’s relation to his environment and the biosphere—that small existing
envelope of available land, water, and air within which we can survive.
For the present phenomenon is that our culture and our environment are
no more at war with each other on terms of rough equality, but that
rather our material culture is in danger of destroying our old presumed
enemy, nature.

Americans especially have been brought up to be at war with nature,
beginning with a European heritage in which it was assumed that nature
itself was an enemy against whose onslaughts one built houses and walls,
made fires, hunted wild animals, and ate whatever could be wrenched
out of the soil. Having hacked and burned our way across the frontier,
having been prompted to do this by everything from poetry and English
literature (whose word pictures constantly remind us to fear nature)
to our new technological culture, we have at last turned the scales.
As Ian McHarg and others have recently reminded us, we are about
to dominate and subjugate nature and in the process destroy it. Can we
demonstrate these facts through visual means, so long as people are
more or less unimpressed by reading about them? Can we teach people
to care about their future enough to stop the present relentless pro-
gression into war, starvation, or suffocation? How can we learn enough
about ourselves to stop in time?

During this past winter, the Smithsonian celebrated the third of its
annual symposia, this one on recent advances in the understanding of
social behavior of higher animals. The implications to be drawn from the
symposium, titled ““Man and Beast,” were fairly clear, even though no
one assumed that primate behavior research can tell us all we need to
know about man’s behavior. Quite obviously it cannot, and yet the con-

ference was a fine escape from anthropocentrism. There are many things
that other creatures from ants to birds to baboons can tell us, which can
serve as guides along the way to knowing ourselves. The event was a
splendid one, well attended, and the speakers were greeted with enthusi-
asm not always reserved for such occasions..Much of the credit for all of
this must go to Wilton Dillon who took over the complex organi-
zation of seminars for us during the past year.

This seminar revealed a characteristic of the Smithsonian. A meeting
such as this, assaying relations between human social behavior and prin-
ciples drawn from the scientific study of animal behavior, seems instantly
6 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

to knit together so many common concerns from within the Institution’s
disparate bureaux. The field is one in which the Smithsonian’s Tropical
Research Institute in Panama has done leading work for many years. In
addition the Office of Ecology, the National Zoological Park, and the
Primate Biology Program of the Museum of Natural History have all
been involved creatively.

From 13 through 16 May the eleven speakers, several hundred in-
vited participants, and staff members widely drawn from the Smith-
sonian explored the extent to which aggression, cooperation, competition,
and territoriality were common to man and other species. The sympo-
sium yielded a rich perspective on the emergence of cultural factors
whose operation attenuates the influence of our biological heritage, cor-
recting an overemphasis attributed to innate behavior by a number of
popular writers. The opening academic procession represented sym-
bolically the fulfillment of the ideal of a scholarly community which the
succeeding days of seminars, colloquia, formal papers, and social events
realized in strikingly tangible manner. We are most grateful to the
Russell Sage Foundation, The Grant Foundation, the Alfred P. Sloan
Foundation, The Commonwealth Fund, and other contributing sponsors,
and also to the inspiring chairmanship of Dr. Alex A. Kwapong, Vice
Chancellor of the University of Ghana, who so ably presided. The pro-
ceedings of the symposium will shortly appear from the Smithsonian
Institution Press under the title Man and Beast: Comparative Social
Behavior.

An aspect of the Smithsonian’s ideal of functioning as a community
of scolars consists of improving communication among the complex of
universities and research establishments in the Washington area. In
July 1968 we inaugurated a regular bulletin, The Washington Academic
Calendar, listing seminars and lectures being given throughout the
metropolitan area. This bulletin is mailed as a service to university and
independent laboratory staff members. The mailing list for the Calen-_
dar, which now contains more than 6,000 names, will serve as the nu--
cleus of a continuing file of Washington area academic interests, listing
recipients by discipline and institutional affiliation. We hope eventually
to be able to correlate the pattern of academic events with the array of
interests in the city and its institutional patterns—a study, as it were, of
the academic ecology of an urban area.

As a visible manifestation of our function as a community I can think
of no better indication than the award, in a pleasant ceremony before
the Joseph Henry statue, on 5 June 1969, of Certificates of Academic |
Achievement to postdoctoral associates and graduate students on ap-
pointments from the Office of Academic Programs. Not a degree, and
awarded with advance approval of each student’s university, the Cer-
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 7

tificate attests to the satisfactory completion of an assignment chosen
by the student himself in consultation with a supervisor. Professor Henry
understood the Smithsonian to be a “College of discoverers,” with stu-
dents participating intensively in its work. To the extent that we have
helped to perpetuate his concept of the Institution as an auxiliary aca-
demic establishment we have helped to underscore one very important
objective of the Institution. Despite the monolithic tendency of our
federal government to wish to centralize and combine efforts and funds
continually in the name of efficiency, the administration of pure research
tends to elude such neat solutions. In connection with work on the
President’s Marine Sciences Council, all the members were asked to
comment on the council report at the end of 1968. I was struck by the
reference to the importance of small independent institutions such as
the Marine Biological Station at Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Like the
MBS, as it is called, the Smithsonian operates independently on its own
small budget, but serves as part of an interlocking network of a national
community of scholars. Dr. Leland Haworth, then Director of the
National Science Foundation, when writing to Vice President Agnew
on 10 March 1969 in regard to oceanographic research, said (speaking
of Woods Hole) ; “we can see merit in having such independent research
organizations.” The same seems to apply to the Smithsonian.

Our symposia can thus serve as points of focus for a wide range of
associated Institution activities, from seminar series to exhibits, from
productions for the media to special publications. The coming year will
be devoted in large measure to studies of cultural change and displays
bearing upon this theme. In the year following we hope to conduct an
intensive examination of the impact of technology upon society, in-
cluding a major exhibition on technology and art, the preparation of
curriculum materials for educational institutions, and a large number
of scholarly sessions devoted to detailed aspects of this general theme.
In this way we begin to bind together the different parts of the assem-
blage and orchestrate a theme uniting their efforts toward a given end.

A second major goal is to achieve reinforcement within our arrays of
reference resources. A curator’s expertise and personal knowledge, built
up over a lifetime of study, represent an information resource, as do the
books and reprints he has gathered around himself; then, as in an outer
concentric circle, come the ordered materials of a collection. We are
purposefully seeking ways to conduct these activities so that each rein-
forces the others to the maximum practical extent. Not books separate
from objects; not specialized information services separate from either,
but rather integrated reference systems which can unite all three. The
Smithsonian’s uniqueness and value depends upon our success in being
a different kind of marshalling center where recorded knowledge gives
8 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

wide access to pertinent inquiry and is not regarded as a burdensome
encumbrance or permitted to weigh down our ventures into ideas.

Out of this springs a kind of neo-economy. Our collections in biolog-
ical and geological materials—often gathered at random—may by their
very size and multiplicity end up being our single most important asset.
Our data bank of specimens, even though we may not today be able to
extract the ideal information we need, may turn out in a hundred years
to represent four or five times the genetic diversity then available to us,
for by that time seventy-five to eighty percent of the species of living
animals or plants may be extinct.

The very variety of resources of the Institution may have begun to
work against effectiveness in our exhibits. Too many aspects of a given
subject may be out of sight in other buildings where they are excluded
from consideration in preparing exhibits. This year I have appointed a
special commission to reappraise the exhibits function within the Insti-
tution and seek ways to unify our presentations, to make them more
responsive to visitors’ interests and more appealing to all of our citizens.
Exhibits that merely display objects from the collections, individually
labeled and placed behind glass, reinforce the fragmentation of the
Smithsonian, while those whose aim is to interpret a wider domain of
knowledge help to realize its converging interests.

Cohesive programs must be given concerted management. This year
an enormously important step was taken in re-establishing the position
of Treasurer of the Institution as a central office to oversee budgeting,
control, planning, development, and fiscal management. The Office of
Programming and Budget has begun an intensive analysis of the use
of Institution resources—both public and private—in the context of a
statement of objectives and the analysis of functions. We have been for-
tunate indeed that T. Ames Wheeler, formerly of the Allegheny-
Ludlum Steel Corporation, joined the Smithsonian staff as Treasurer in
September 1968. Under his care both public and private funds can be
marshalled to achieve true effectiveness.

This has been a year of continued questioning in America—insistent,
sometimes shrill, penetrating, skeptical, above all, iconoclastic. Critics
charge the entire educational system with grave deficiencies, doubt the
wisdom of our acceptance of technology, and find all too small a return
from massive social investments in government programs. The Smith-
sonian has not been invaded by angry protesters or disrupted by dissi-
dents but it cannot escape the need, which is becoming so general in
our time, to subject its activities to the most searching review and to
reappraise its objectives in the light of the more rigorous expectations
of the day. No institution is too venerable or too valuable to be exempted
from such scrutiny. In government jargon the phrase is, “let us get back
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 9

to the base.” An “open” university such as ours should thrive on
self-examination.

The first thing we must expect from any institution is that it frame
socially valuable objectives and conduct its affairs in accord with them.
Yet charitable and governmental establishments are shaped in large
measure by past legacies. Once-plausible aims may shrink with time
into nostalgic obsolescence. Bureaux, divisions, working groups, com-
mittees, and a host of other administrative entities are set up within
institutions, given separate charters, and thereafter pursue independent
and conflicting courses until what was meant to be an orderly flotilla
comes to resemble a park basin cluttered with children’s toy boats of
every conceivable description in total disarray. The word institution
comes from the Latin verb statuere, to set up, implying an end in view.
Only as ends are served can an institution be maintained as a viable
whole whose parts, like those of any functioning organism, must be
interdependent.

To many people the Smithsonian Institution must seem improbably
heterogeneous, built up over the years like a midden heap of collected
objects, many priceless and all interesting. As I have suggested, the
collections may be priceless but they are not the institution any more
than buildings are a university. It is the scholars who for one reason or
another have been attracted to us, full time or part time, as permanent
or transient workers, who can perhaps learn to grasp the meaning of the
collections. By being in touch with real objects and by being attentive to
the real situations in which these objects were placed or developed,
perhaps our scholars can develop what Kant, speaking of the spon-
taneous interplay of our own intellectual powers, called the “synthetic
unity of aperception.” This is learning, and curators are capable of this
even if teachers are not always so. But if a curator understands such a
situation in nature or in a culture coherently and wholly, then he is
better as a teacher than most teachers.

The whole problem of teaching today revolves around whether
teaching really teaches people how to learn, or whether it comes down
to getting people out of schools fast, having coerced them through fear
and competitive pressure into getting meaningless diplomas. Recently
graduate students in a survey conducted by the American Political
Science Association have been complaining about college work per-
formed under a climate of “threat and fear.’ Learning to learn must
certainly be a failure if it merely means aping the teacher, becoming an
“apple-polisher,’ or picking up the innate structure of a teacher’s
behavior. Or is that really what we all should do in order to get on in
life? I am inclined to think not, as I doubt that we can survive this way.

Museums teach us about real things, which is one reason why young

366-269 O—70——2
10 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

people like them. They also tend to put things in perspective, in a his-
torical context, which young people tend not to learn in other ways. One
failure of teaching in the social sciences has been to eliminate dates as
having any contextual value. Thus the steppingstones which an earlier
generation memorized, from the defeat of the Persian fleet at Salamis
right onward, tend to be left out. The Persian fleet might have been
defeated at the Battle of the Coral Sea for all young people today know.
One of the failures of TV is also in the scale of time. Everything is
instant. It is happening now in an existential manner, which fails to
convey reality.

Museums offer an opportunity for training in reality which few
pedagogues suspect or know. Musuems are open universities. Only ex-
amples really count, especially when they can be grasped in the round.
How then can young people plan for the future without tenable exam-
ples and a historical context? Planning is probably the most important
aspect of the future, along with the understanding of ecosystems. It
would seem that we may be heading into a form of civil war as far as
planning is concerned. Education today being reductionist in emphasis,
technology being dominant and reductionist in principle, there can per-
haps be no solution so long as our economics persists as it does. The quiet
voices of rational and studious students of the environment will prob-
ably not suffice. We may well be swept aside by the groundswell of opin-
ion of those—from militant students on through the middle-aged mid-
dle class living in quiet desperation—who, mindful of the futility of
growing old, finally reject our social and economic goals based on sub-
jective private initiative.

One major task of this Institution should be to experiment with
learning techniques. If this research could ever produce a method to
create a sense of reality, and to awaken interests in people, then the
Smithsonian would indeed have lived up to its mandate.

Another notable event of this year besides the opening of the Portrait
Gallery has been the ground-breaking ceremony for the Joseph H. Hirsh-
horn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Authorized under the 90th Con-
gress, the building with its sculpture garden should be completed in
another two years. The ceremony was performed 8 January 1969 by
President Johnson, the Smithsonian’s Chancellor, Chief Justice Earl
Warren, and the Secretary before a distinguished audience of members
of Congress, the Administration and the world of art.
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 11

To the superlative collection of fine art he has donated to the United
States for the benefit of the people, in 1969 Mr. Hirshhorn’s continued
generosity resulted in the addition of more than five hundred new
paintings and sculptures—an average of over ten new works each week
received, cataloged, and stationed by Abram Lerner and his staff of three.
Since November 1966, the date of Mr. Hirshhorn’s gift, his generosity
has led to the acquisition of outstanding new paintings and sculptures
valued at over one million dollars each year, in addition to the one mil-
lion dollars he has agreed to donate for future purchases upon the
opening of the Hirshhorn Museum.

In this first year since its opening, exhibitions have been a major
part of the activity of the National Collection of Fine Arts in trying out
its new space. The first of these areas to be developed has been the low-
vaulted, crypt-like spaces of the Granite Gallery, which proved ad-
mirably suited to the bronze sculpture of an exhibition of the works of
Alexander Archipenko.

A major achievement of the year was the retrospective exhibition of
paintings, drawings, and photographs by Charles Sheeler organized by
the NcFaA staff, with its full and richly documented catalog as a per-
manent reminder of the exhibition and as a scholarly reference. The
Sheeler exhibition continued with showings at the Philadelphia Museum
of Art and at the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York.

During the year David Scott—who had done so much to help in the
installation of the National Collection in its new quarters and who had,
with the NoFA staff done a great deal to attract interest to the collec-
tions—resigned. Robert Tyler Davis, a new member of the staff as assis-
tant director, took over as acting director, until late summer 1969, when
the appointment of Joshua Taylor, Professor of the History of Art at the
University of Chicago and a specialist in the history of American Art,
was announced.

During the year negotiations have proceeded to bring the Archives
of American Art to a new headquarters within the Smithsonian in
Washington, part of a proposed network of art historical reference
centers to be planned across the nation. This enormous resource, when
added to the holdings in the Smithsonian, will go far toward making
the National Collection what it should be, the heart of a documentation
and research center in the history of our own indigenous art.

Efforts of the Museum of History and Technology to expand the
scope of our activities beyond those traditional to museums have been
reflected in a number of directions. Under contract the Museum has
undertaken the collection of data on Afro-American history, and has
made a small beginning in the collection of materials for exhibition
in this field. A 19th-century sharecropper’s cabin has been acquired and
12 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

is presently being installed as part of an exhibit of the history of American
Negro culture. In other areas of ethnic cultural history our staff has
conducted research on the church of San Xavier del Bac (circa 1783)
near Tucson, Arizona, and on early pottery making in California. A
shopfront from a gold-rush period community near San Francisco is
presently being put on exhibit. The Museum has undertaken a program
of research and recording in the folk music of an eastern mountain com-
munity at Galax, Virginia.

The Computer History Project, supported by the American Federa-
tion of Information Processing Societies, is now in its second year, under
the direction of Dr. Uta Merzbach. This project comprehends the
collection of documents and tape-recorded interviews with persons
important in the development of the computer. Another major project
in its second year is the New England Textile Mill survey. A report of
the first summer’s work, chiefly at Manchester, New Hampshire, was
published this year.

This year our National Museum of History and Technology wel-
comes a new Director, Professor Daniel Boorstin, Preston and Sterling
Morton Distinguished Service Professor of Ancient History, of the
University of Chicago, and one of our most eminent living American
historians. The pleasant coincidence that Professor Boorstin has also
been reappointed to President Nixon’s Commission on the American
Revolution Bicentennial, affords us additional opportunity to cooperate
closely with the Commission on plans for the Nation’s observance of
renewed dedication to our founding principles of liberty and equality
before all men.

This has been a year of program formulation for the Cooper-Hewitt
Museum of Design in New York. A lease has been arranged with the
Carnegie Corporation, owner of the Andrew Carnegie mansion on
Fifth Avenue at Ninety-first Street, and it is hoped that the Museum
will be installed there in its own quarters by 1971.

The kinds of programs and services offered by the Cooper-Hewitt
Museum bring to the Smithsonian new educational opportunities in
the world of design. In today’s ever-rapidly evolving concept of fashion
and beauty, the need for a museum showcase, in which an endlessly
rich variety of historical decorative arts material can be drawn upon,
utilized, and enjoyed, provides a springboard which the Smithsonian can
be influential in offering guidelines to more beautiful design in everyday
life. The Museum’s future move to upper Fifth Avenue will place us
on New York’s “Museum Row.”’ Thus we hope the Cooper-Hewitt
Museum will be able eventually to assume its proper place as a show-
case of international reputation in the world of design. Particular thanks
are owing to the newly formed Advisory Board under Mrs. Alice M.
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 13

Kaplan, in recognition of the hard work, enthusiasm, and generous con-
tributions, both in time and money, that it has made in reestablishing
the Cooper-Hewitt Museum as a new, visible entity in New York.

One of the ways in which the Smithsonian increases knowledge is by
stimulating those not on its staff to work on intellectual problems that
need solving. The Smithsonian is able to do this not only by offering
visiting appointments to outside scholars but by training graduate stu-
dents from universities with whom it maintains a relationship. The
Smithsonian has for many years guided small numbers of graduate stu-
dents in the sciences. More recently it has provided advanced training
for graduate students in the humanities, most notably through its Amer-
ican Studies Program, now in its fourth year of operation. Graduate
students in American history and American studies from four univer-
sities are this year pursuing courses of study under Smithsonian advisors.
Most of them are not receiving fellowships or scholarships from the
Smithsonian. Some are writing dissertations which when completed
will enlarge important areas of human knowledge and, in many cases,
interpret Smithsonian collections to the scholarly world for the first
time. By such means the Smithsonian with a minimum expenditure can
obtain a maximum effect in carrying out its historic mission.

Under the direction of our discerning editor, Nathan Reingold, the
Joseph Henry Papers staff has come nearly to the end of its extensive
search, in domestic and foreign archives, for documents on the life and
work of the first Secretary. Some 16,000 documents are in hand. The
staff is now beginning to edit material for the first volume (of an antici-
pated twenty on Henry’s years in Albany, New York (1797-1832),
where he educated himself, began his teaching career, and carried out
some of his most important work in electromagnetism.

In April 1969 Congressional Regent Frank T. Bow introduced House
bill H.R. 10001 incorporating the Smithsonian’s legislative proposal to
provide for the establishment of a National Armed Forces Historical
Museum Park and study center to be designated. the Dwight D. Eisen-
hower Center for Historical Research. The proposal also includes
authority for the Board of Regents and the Secretary of the Interior
to enter into an agreement for the joint use of lands now under the
jurisdiction of the Department of the Interior as the site for the museum
park. This legislation seeks to fulfill the goals of three presidentially
appointed panels of distinguished Americans, including the current
National Armed Forces Museum Advisory Board, dedicated to the con-
viction that an armed forces museum can be, as the late President
Eisenhower put it, “a dynamic educational venture . . . [making]

. substantial contribution to our citizens’ knowledge and understand-
ing of American life.”
14 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

The choice of President Eisenhower’s name for the proposed study
center is most appropriate in that it was he who in 1958 convened the
President’s Committee on the Armed Forces Museum under the chair-
manship of former Chief Justice Earl Warren. The recommendations
of this Committee led to enactment of Public Law 87-186, establishing
a permanent Advisory Board and providing the concept on which the
pending legislation is based. Indeed, only a few weeks before his death,
President Eisenhower in a letter to our Chancellor reiterated his com-
mitment to a national armed forces historical museum and study center.

Our hopes for the Eisenhower Center received a most substantial
boost during the year, when the American Military Institute placed on
long-term deposit with the Smithsonian its large and valuable library.
The collection contains more than 15,000 volumes concentrated on
military history and other areas of social sciences having relevance to
military affairs. The amr collection will serve most admirably as the
nucleus around which to build the sort of reference library which will
be indispensable to the Center.

Two major events in the areas of air and space during the year focused
public attention on the National Air and Space Museum. The first was
the celebration—in collaboration with the United States Navy—of the
fiftieth anniversary of the first transatlantic flight by the NC—4, in May
of 1919. The second was the build-up of activity throughout the year
of the Apollo Program in preparation for the moon landing, including
the successful circum-lunar flights of Apollo 8, 9, and 10.

Although the NC-4 had been in the Smithsonians’ custody for many
years, it has recently been in protective storage, pending the avail-
ability of a new building large enough to house it. The Navy’s request
for its public display during the month of May 1969 necessitated an
accelerated restoration program. The job was completed, and the air-
craft was ready for public display on the Washington Mall for the entire
month. Many thousands of visitors were thus reminded of its famous
flight across the Atlantic, now fifty years ago.

With the accelerating interest in the Apollo program as it approached ~
its great objective of a manned lunar landing our 1967 Agreement with _
NASA began to pay significant dividends. The opportunity to see full-
scale Saturn and Apollo artifacts—including Apollo 4 (with the related
F-1 and J—2 engines), plus “Surveyor” and the Lunar Orbiter—all of
which would have been impossible without our close cooperation with
NASA—attracted thousands of visitors to the South Hall of the Arts
and Industries Building. These large hardware items were exhibited in
a setting of space-oriented TV display, photography, paintings and
sculpture which were continuously updated to keep visitors informed —
of significant events as they occurred.
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 15

In addition the operation of the Nasa agreement has brought into
the Air and Space Museum’s inventory a large amount of material for
future use, from which can be drawn display material for loans to other
museums. During the year such Smithsonian artifacts were on display
in London, Lucerne, Barcelona, Munich, Tokyo, and Brisbane, as well
as in a number of cities of the United States.

SCIENCE

Scientific activities of the Smithsonian commence locally with the
National Museum of Natural History and spread out widely in fields
as superficially diverse as astrophysics and ecology. In this past year,
the Natural History Museum has acquired a Scanning Electron Micro-
scope (SEM) a major step in the planned research activities of our
staff. This marvelous new instrument is able to magnify the images
of tiny objects from 20 to 140,000 times and with several hundred times
greater resolution than the conventional light-optical system. For the
first time, the basic architecture of thousands of species of organisms,
can be seen and studied as whole individuals, whereas formerly elabo-
rate sectioning and replication techniques were required.

The sem which was developed at Cambridge University in Eng-
land represents a major breakthrough in the field of microscopy. In
only four years since it became commercially available, it has become
a dominant research too] in such diverse fields in biology as pollen
analysis, microfossil identification, and textile fiber-wear studies. In one
area of basic research being done at the Smithsonian, Dr. R. H. Ben-
son is using the sem for the study of the history of a minute fossil
crustacean, the ostracode, which has lived on the floor of the deep
ocean basins. His recent discovery of these microfossils in the rocks of
the Alps suggests new dimensions to the ocean that once separated
Europe from Africa during the time when dinosaurs dominated the
landscape. The sem allows for much greater precision in the identi-
fication and analysis of the living as well as fossil deep-sea ostracodes.
Through their study it is hoped that massive movements of the ocean
floor, which took place during the formation of mountain systems, can
be discovered. This instrument will be available for use, when needed,
by scientists in all departments of the Museum, many of whom have
already made plans to use it in their research.

One does not ordinarily imagine collaboration between researchers
in volcanology and archeology but a joint field effort of the Depart-
ments of Anthropology and Mineral Sciences is underway to establish
the historical background for the eruption of Mt. Arenal in Costa
16 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

Rica last year, as well as to study the volcanic phenomena it presented.

Similarly, the sedimentologists in the Department of Paleobiology
have collaborated with Mineral Sciences to contribute to a rapidly
growing accumulation of evidence favoring the theory of continental
drift. The spatial relationships between sedimentary rocks and the
crustal ones along the mid-Atlantic Ridge have clearly indicated the
phenomenon of sea-floor spreading.

Meanwhile two teams of Smithsonian investigators, one at Cam-
bridge in the Astrophysical Observatory, the other at the Natural His-
tory building in Washington are preparing for interdisciplinary research
on lunar samples, one of soil, the other of rock, jointly to be studied by
geochemists, meteorists, petrologists, and physicists.

A signal triumph this year has been that of G. Arthur Cooper who
has successfully devised means of sampling the entire brachiopod fauna
of the Glass Mountain beds of the Permian era. His work will have
significant consequences for all students of population biology as well
as for paleontologists.

ECOLOGY

The Smithsonian’s concern with ecology spreads across a number
of scientific disciplines as well as organizations and finally comes home
to rest in the social sciences, within the purview of our new concern
in post-doctoral research. The Office of Ecology participates directly
in research, sponsors other research, and is related to other departments
and offices through interdisciplinary programs. On its own, the Office
has participated in investigations of the ecology and ethology of wild
elephants in Ceylon.

In the past year emphasis was placed on studies of the population
dynamics, inter- and intra-specific competition, food habits, patterns
of movement and land use, reproduction state, and the density of
habitat usage. Also in Ceylon, the basic structure of the domestic
elephant reproductive cycle was worked out for the first time.

As Smithsonian participants in the International Biological Program
(1BP), Lee Talbot and Raymond Fosberg assisted with an inventory
of Pacific islands and parts of islands as preserves of rare scientific
resources. Areas are being listed for conservation where they have been
relatively uninfluenced by human activity and contain unique flora
and fauna. As a result of the pp conservation section meetings on Palau
and Guam, data have been assembled and will be published.

Requests for advice and consultation on ecological problems were
answered from the National Park Service and the United States Fish
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 17

and Wildlife Service of the Department of Interior; the Pacific Science
Board, the Environmental Sciences Board, and the Division of Behav-
ioral Sciences of the National Academy of Sciences and the National
Research Council; the Office of Science and Technology, the Depart-
ment of Defense, the Department of Agriculture, the Congress, and
such international organizations as the International Union for Con-
servation of Nature and Natural Resources, the International Council
for Bird Preservation, the World Wildlife Fund, the United Nations,
and the Pacific Science Association.

The Chesapeake Bay Center for Field Biology completed one level
of its laboratory building and operated as a research arm of the Smith-
sonian through a consortium with the Johns Hopkins University and
the University of Maryland. Studies of the physical conditions and the
populations of organisms in the estuary continued. Dr. Charles South-
wick of the Johns Hopkins University found that the Rhode River
estuary apparently was heavily enriched in September. Drs. William
D. McElroy (on leave as Director of the National Science Foundation) ,
Howard H. Seliger and William G. Fastie, also of Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity, began measurements of the night and day patterns of bio-
luminescence as an index of primary productivity. In the past year a
further effort to raise funds for land acquisition for this most valuable
field station has met with remarkable success. Nearly fifty percent of
our goal of $800,000, to increase our holdings on the western shore of
Chesapeake Bay to some 2000 acres, has been met. We are deeply
grateful to the farsighted foundations; the Ford Foundation, The Re-
search Corporation, the Scaife Foundation, the Old Dominion Foun-
dation, the Fleischmann Foundation, and the Prospect Hill Foundation;
all of whom have helped us in our project to create a national resource
in ecological research, not only near Washington but also as part of a
network of comparative study areas, an environmental consortium of
universities and private and public institutions from Massachusetts to
the Caribbean and Panama. Dr. George Watson completed a three-
year study of the productivity of breeding ospreys at Poplar Island,
a Chesapeake Bay Center property near the eastern shore of the Chesa-
peake Bay. The osprey population is believed to be holding its own
in the Bay despite its susceptibility to pesticides. Whistling swans mean-
while are being studied by Dr. William J. L. Sladen of Johns Hopkins.
More than half of the North American population of these birds winters
in the bay. Studies of their local and long distance movements, feeding
ecology, social behavior, and diseases are being achieved by observation
of unmarked, conspicuously dyed, and radio-tagged birds.
18 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969
HYDROBIOLOGY

In oceanography and limnology, direct observations of plants and
animals living on the bottom of the shallow ocean and in the upper
pelagic areas received considerable attention during the year. A wide
spectrum of activities ranged from sponsorship of a special Edwin A.
Link lecture on underwater man by Jon Lindberg and Dr. Joseph B.
MacInnis and the offering of diver-training courses to field investigations
using scuba apparatus, submersible diving chambers, and small research
submersibles. A multidisciplinary study of sharks and the coral reef
environments was undertaken under the sponsorship of Edwin A. Link,
Seward Johnson, William Mote, Ocean Systems Inc., and the Smith-
sonian Institution in February and March of 1969. Five small vessels
and a submersible diving chamber were assembled off British Honduras
for the project known as sHARK 1969.

Sponsorship through working group 23 of the Scientific Committee
on Ocean Research of the International Council of Scientific Unions
resulted in a definitive study of plankton preservation being under-
taken at the Smithsonian. Dr. Hugh Steedman of the University of
Bath spent the months of July, October, November, March, and June
planning and conducting experiments at the Smithsonian Oceano-
graphic Sorting Center. Plankton preservation has sometimes been
excellent and sometimes unsatisfactory using the traditional preserva-
tives under differing field conditions. Histochemical and other work on
carefully preserved collections will provide information on the causes
of the variable results. Tests will be made to attempt to find better
preservatives.

An “Ocean Acre” research program has been initiated by Drs. William
Aron, Robert Gibbs, and Clyde Roper in cooperation with the Navy
Underwater Sound Laboratory, the University of Rhode Island, and
the Naval Oceanographic Office. Four cruises, using navy ships Gillis,
Sands, and Trident of the University of Rhode Island, were undertaken
during this fiscal year. The area selected for achieving a fuller under-
standing of its total biology is southeast of Bermuda in water depths
greater than 2000 meters. Preliminary analyses of the distributions of
cephalopods and fishes reveals variations in their migratory behavior
patterns which may be associated with sound-scattering layers.

This year was one of great progress in converting the older manual
records of the Smithsonian Oceanographic Sorting Center into an auto-
matic data-processing system. Specimen labels are prepared in an auto-
matic typewriter system which simultaneously produces duplicate labels
and punches the data on paper tape. This tape is converted to magnetic |
tape automatically and goes into storage with a minimum of error.

STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 19

Nearly all of the several years production of Antarctic data covering
thirteen million specimens has been entered in the machine system.

Installation of basic petrographic laboratory equipment was com-
pleted in the Sorting Center. A specimen inventory has been prepared
to meet the needs of specialists interested in specific mineralogic, tex-
tural, or lithologic features of oceanic rocks. As a backup for the speci-
mens being distributed, a major catalog of oceanic rocks has been pro-
duced to include all that have been described in the scientific literature.
Specific mineral groups and lab information in the literature may be
found through the catalog.

RADIATION BIOLOGY AND ASTROPHYSICS

The Radiation Biology Laboratory of the Institution has participated
actively in interdisciplinary ecology during the year. Under the Labora-
tory, the third seminar series sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution
and the Consortium of Universities of the Washington Metropolitan
Area was introduced on 6 February by Dr. Sidney Galler, Assistant
Secretary for Science. The Seminar in Environmental Biology was pre-
sented for graduate credit and attracted large audiences of students and
other interested people from the community. Thirteen lectures were
presented by authorities in ecology and environmental biology from
all over the United States, with topics ranging from arid-land to arctic
ecology and from fresh-water productivity to aspects of controlled
environments for space biology.

For the past year the Smithsonian Radiation Biology Laboratory has
recorded continuous daily measurements from sunrise to sunset of
several color components of the white-light spectrum in those wave-
bands that control growth and development of plant and animal orga-
nisms. This is the only complete set of data of this kind obtained for
biologists to use in studying photobiological responses. Under the joint
sponsorship of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Physical
Laboratory of Israel, a station in Jerusalem has begun operation to
obtain similar information for that latitude. The measurements from
the two stations will provide comparative records on ratios of color
bands present in natural incident daylight and resultant cycles of growth
and reproduction, leading to new interpretations of the effects of
light stimuli as a factor in the environment controlling physiological
development.

In the course of recording measurements of normal incident solar
radiation at the Smithsonian, it was discovered that the amount of the
sun’s energy falling on Washington, D.C., now is approximately fifteen
20 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

percent less that that measured and recorded here by Dr. C. G. Abbot
in 1907 at the same time of the year. Measurements are continuing to
be taken and efforts are in progress to confirm the preliminary data.
The results should be of the greatest interest to those ecologists con-
cerned with the energy-exchange phenomena between biological sys-
tems and the atmosphere, as well, indeed, to urban planners concerned
with human health.

During the past year the Center for Short-Lived Phenomena, an
organization set up by the Astrophysical Observatory, participated in
127 geological, astrophysical, and biological events including 21 major
earthquakes, 18 volcanic eruptions (one involving the birth and disap-
pearance of an island), 21 fireballs, 11 major oil spills, 9 fish kills, 4
rare-animal migrations, 3 freshly fallen meteorite recoveries, the dis- —
covery of a stone-axe tribe, and several dozen other land and marine
ecological events.

The Center assisted in the coordination of activities for reconnais-
sance missions and scientific field expeditions to the Fernandina Caldera
collapse in the Galapagos Islands, the Mt. Arenal volcanic eruption
in Costa Rica, the Cerro Negro volcanic eruption in Nicaragua, the
Applachian squirrel migration in the eastern United States, the Mt.
Merapi volcanic eruption in Indonesia, and the Pueblito de Allende
meteorite shower in Mexico.

During the Apollo 11 Manned Lunar Mission, the Center arranged
communications between 207 astronomical observers in thirty countries
and maintained daily contact with the Manned Spacecraft Center,
NASA, at Houston, Texas. Reports from ground-based observers were
relayed to the msc for transmittal to the astronauts en route to and
orbiting the moon; this mission provided an opportunity for astronauts
to confirm (by observation and photography) ground-based observa-
tions of transient lunar events.

The Center has established an effective global reporting network
of 1510 scientists in many disciplines and from 118 countries.

During the past year the Center issued 127 event notification reports,
764 event information reports, 16 final event publications, and 11.
preprints of scientific papers on the preliminary results of field |
investigations.

By all odds it would seem the Center for Short-Lived Phenomena
(a Gilbertian title if ever there was one) is here to stay. In addition
to its brainchild, the Smithsonian’s Astrophysical Observatory has had |
a notable year. On 23 October 1968, the Observatory opened its Mount |
Hopkins, Arizona, facility, a celebration presided over by Representative
Morris K. Udall of Arizona. The station will have a tracking camera,
a pulsed ruby-laser ranging system, a 12-inch telescope already installed |

STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 21

preparatory to a 60-inch telescope for investigation of stellar and
planetary atmospheres, and a 10-meter light collector designed for the
detection of gamma rays from celestial sources. In conjunction with
“NASA, experiments have been started at Mount Hopkins to establish
criteria for the selection of sites for future ground-based astronomy
research.

On 7 December 1968, the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration launched the second Orbiting Astronomical Observatory
(OAO-2) from Cape Kennedy, Florida. The two-ton satellite con-
|tained two major scientific experiments, including Project Celescope,
/a Smithsonian-designed, television-telescope system for observing stars in
ultraviolet light.

One week later, at 2:49 a.m., 14 December, the Celescope cameras
made the first ultraviolet photographs of the heavens, showing three
6th-magnitude stars in the constellation Draco.

Between launch and the end of June 1969, the Celescope experi-
ment obtained nearly 2500 photographs of stars. Although one camera
has stopped operating and the three remaining systems are experiencing
some loss of sensitivity owing to prolonged exposure to space radiation,
‘the Celescope experiment is expected to continue to return valuable
scientific data for several more months.

_ An early evaluation of the photographic data indicates that very few
‘of the stars measured by Celescope are appreciably brighter than
expected. Also, about twenty percent of the objects found by Celescope
near the plane of the Galaxy do not appear in identification atlases,
whereas nearly every object more than ten degrees from the plane
‘does. Presumably, the extra stars are mostly faint O and B stars; but,
-additional ground-based observations may be necessary to confirm this
theory.

_ The optical tracking network of the sao participated in all the
‘Apollo manned-spacecraft missions during this period.

_ The most spectacular result of this participation occurred on 21
December 1968, when the sao camera station at Maui, Hawaii, photo-
graphed the burn of the booster rockets that injected the Apollo 8
spacecraft into the translunar phase of its flight to the moon. The same
day, the sao tracking station at San Fernando, Spain, photographed
the cloud of excess fuel dumped by the Apollo 8 spacecraft some 30,000
miles from earth.

On 4 March 1969, the sao stations at Hawaii and Mount Hopkins

gain photographed an Apollo 9 fuel-release cloud at a distance of
approximately 70,000 miles from earth. The photographs of these fuel
‘dumps proved highly valuable to Nasa engineers and scientists attempt-
‘ing to understand the behavior of liquids in space.

29 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

TROPICAL BIOLOGY

Environmental studies continued at an increased rate at the Tropical
Research Institute in Panama. The nation’s unique tropically based
laboratory has been working on interspecific and intraspecific competi-
tion in terrestrial and marine organisms. An event of the past year,
tragic yet perhaps fortuitous was the grounding of oil tanker Witwater
off the Galeta Station of the Institute on the Atlantic coast of the Canal
Zone. Research on recovery rates of marine organisms subjected to oil,
may prove to be beneficial in the long run to studies of oil spills, bound
to become more frequent round the world as time goes on. Meanwhile
comparative base-line studies in tropical ecosystems remain our primary
goal for this Institute.

For many years a large but rather scarce impressive looking, spiny,
poisonous, multi-armed starfish has been observed from the coral reefs
of the Indian and Pacific Oceans, and from the Red Sea to Hawaii.
Little was known of its habits, life history, or ecology. It is commonly
known as the Crown of Thorns Starfish, zoologically as Acanthaster
planci.

In 1960, near Green Island on Australia’s Great Barrier Reef, a
sudden population explosion occurred. Acanthaster began to swarm in
large numbers over the reefs, and was seen to feed on the living coral
animals, leaving nothing but the bare limestone skeletons. Under the
stress of hunger, as their food supply diminished, the starfish changed
from nocturnal habits to venturing out in broad daylight in their search
for food.

Large areas of the famous Great Barrier Reef were changed from
living animal communities to masses of bare dead limestone skeletons.
All of the multitudes of animals that depend directly or indirectly on
the corals for food were starved out of the affected areas. These include
large numbers of fish, lobsters, crabs, and other economically important
reef animals.

Two years ago a similar outbreak occurred on the reefs that line the
coast of Guam in the western Pacific. Here it spread rapidly until at
last report, an area twenty-six miles off the Guam coast was practically
stripped of living corals. More recently outbreaks have been reported
from a number of other areas in the Trust Territory of the Pacific
Islands administered by the United States.

The citizens of Guam, fearing the loss of the reefs, brought the catas-
trophe to the attention of an International Biological Program meeting
on island conservation problems (November 1968), which included two”
Smithsonian biologists. Subsequently the Interior Department under- |
took a crash survey of the situation in Micronesia to develop a synoptic
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 23

picture of the phenomenon and try to isolate the causal factors. This
investigation now being conducted by Westinghouse Ocean Research
Laboratory, includes three Smithsonian marine scientists, Dr. Porter
Kier, Dennis M. Devaney, and Thomas F. Phelan, as well as other
United States and foreign experts. These men are specialists, some of
the very few in the nation, and the Smithsonian is proud to be able to
participate in such an important study. Potentially a starfish explosion
could undermine and destroy fringing reefs throughout the Pacific
threatening the entire economy of the area. Fortunately present evidence
indicates that the starfish can conquer coral reef animals only in areas
that have been disturbed by dynamiting. Controls can presumably be
worked out to prevent man’s wreaking further hardship upon himself
and his environment for short-term gains.

Interdisciplinary research continues to develop effectively within the
Natural History and Anthropology disciplines. Not only has primate
biology proved a useful bridge between these broad areas of science, but
also geology and paleoclimatology are closely related to archeological
research in Central and South America.

Of great interest in this connection is the work of Drs. Evans and
Meggers of the Anthropology staff, with Dr. Melson of the Mineral
Sciences division, in dating volcanic ash falls and determining special
characteristics and age of volcanic activity at El Arenal, Costa Rica,
and Quijos Valley, eastern Ecuador, with the archeological specimens
from levels in the sites that had been covered by volcanic materials.

Similarly petrographic studies have been made, especially by electron
microprobe analysis, of obsidian artifacts that had been used in obsidian
dating of the archeological cultures from sites in the Quijos Valley to
determine unique features of composition that might be affecting the
hydration rates. Through this technique new information on dating for
archeology and volcanology has been obtained.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

One of the aims of the National Zoological Park is to have a truly
professional staff. The addition of a pathologist, Robert M. Sauer
VMD, has been a step toward achieving this goal. We now have a
trained zoologist at the head of the department of living vertebrates,
another in charge of the bird collection, another heads the reptile
division, and still another has been appointed as assistant to Dr. John
F. Eisenberg in the scientific research department.

The National Zoo has continued its efforts to protect and conserve
wildlife and natural resources. In addition to cooperating with national
24 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

and international organizations devoted to wildlife protection, the Zoo
has made its special contribution. The International Union for the
Conservation of Nature publishes a list of rare and endangered species
throughout the world. The list mentions golden marmoset, orangutan,
scimitar-horned oryx, Pére David’s deer, Laysan duck, Hawaiian duck,
and Swinhoe’s pheasant. Each of these has been born or hatched at
the National Zoological Park during the past year.

PUBLIC SERVICES

Through the impetus established several years ago by the Institution’s
undertaking to direct and coordinate research for United States anthro-
pology and biology programs overseas, using dollar equivalents of stated
excess currencies, the Smithsonian has been able to help more than
forty-four American learned institutions and universities in the conduct
of original research.

The initial implementation of the Smithsonian’s role as executive
agent for the Iran-United States science cooperation agreement occurred
this year with the exchange of visits between Dr. Faryar, Underminister
of Science and Education in Iran, and the Director of the Office of
International Activities. Methods of disseminating research plans of |
scientists from each country interested in cooperative work have been |
established and efforts are now underway to locate funding sources.

The Smithsonian’s expertise in assessing the environmental conse-—
quences of an isthmian sea-level canal was recognized by the appoint- |
ment of Dr. David Challinor of our Office of International Activities
to the National Academy of Sciences special Committee on Ecological
Research for the Interoceanic Canal.

During the past year Morocco was added to the list of “excess” cur-
rency countries and already several projects have been initiated by
Smithsonian scientists for work there. The addition of Morocco has
been particularly welcome because of the pending removal of Tunisia
and Ceylon from the list of countries in which the Smithsonian’s Foreign
Currency Program operates.

The Smithsonian Associates membership now stands at 9,200 com-
pared with 6,500 a year ago. This includes individuals, double and
family membership, meaning that our memberships serve approximately
20,000 people. Our renewal average stands at a phenomenal 89 percent.

Some of the Associates activities have included luncheon talks on
collecting (painting, sculpture, prints, drawings, ceramics, glass, and
furniture) now in its third year. Once again this has proved extremely
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 25

popular with 375 members attending the talks each month over a
period of six months.

The Ancient Crafts Revived series was oversubscribed. Our work-
shops included batik, weaving, mosaic, stained glass, bookbinding, paste
paper, marble-and-paste, cloisonné, enamel, plique-a-jour, decoupage
and tole. For the first time this series was offered to young people (ten
to thirteen years). The classes included enameling, puppet making,
papier maché, wire sculpture, Egyptian paste, and paper weaving.

A particularly memorable event was that of the New York Chamber
Soloists’ performance of music from the Court of the Sun King, Louis
XIV, with recitations from Moliére, Racine, and La Fontaine given
by Jean Louis Barrault and Madaleine Renaud.

This year marks the signing of an official agreement between Mrs.
Merriweather Post, to whom the Institution owes so much, and the
Smithsonian on the maintenance of her wonderful house, “Hillwood.”
The tours to Hillwood have had a continuous waiting list and are
repeated as often as possible.

One of the most popular activities in which the Smithsonian has
engaged continues to be its division of Performing Arts. To bring the
instruments out of glass cases, to evolve the magic of folk crafts and
music, all this is to communicate directly to all people. How better can
our Institution demonstrate the worth of collecting things.

Our highlight of the year was the Festival of American Folklife
which was enhanced this past year by the addition of several continuing
programs. To the half million people who attended the four-day festival
of craft demonstrations and concerts we added five programs con-
ceived for the National Park Service’s “Summer in the Parks.” These
mobile art demonstrations, jazz concerts, folk concerts, puppet theater,
and film theater, traveled to twenty different city parks over a period
of ten weeks.

The Smithsonian libraries continue to command a high priority in
our efforts to increase the Institution’s research and education capability.
Many times throughout the year various departments of the Institution
assisted in financing the purchase of library materials vital to the sup-
port of their research programs. The professional staffs of the museums
and the libraries displayed their mutual concern for maintaining the
high quality of the libraries’ collections by working diligently together
to use their limited funds for the purchase of only those titles that were
of immediate and long-term importance to research. The same coopera-
tion, along with strong policy guidance and management by the office
of the Director of Libraries was applied to the negotiations and acquisi-
tions of five gift collections of research materials that contribute directly
to current bureau programs. This ability to attract donors remains one

366-269 O—70-—3
———<—-

26 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

a a a

of the most essential characteristics of the libraries. Even without a full-
time team of specialists, the libraries have been able to continue the
inevitable introduction of automation of library processing routines,

albeit rather slowly. ;

The libraries’ training program concentrated on improving the data-
processing skills of their staff members at various organizational levels.
With the assistance of the Information Systems Division, the libraries
attained a design for an automated serials purchase system and have
begun data input for the creation of machine-readable records. Still
ahead, but very much in the libraries future, is work on a system for the
integration of files of information in the literature with those pertaining
to specimens and artifacts in the museums, to create a totally responsive
and integrated computerized information storage and retrieval system.

Computers comprise one of the most important frontiers of science
today. The science of computer technology offers a means whereby the
storage of data accumlating throughout the museum complex may be
reduced to useful information. In recognition of this fact, the Informa-
tion Systems Division has continued to develop computerized systems
and techniques to make information more available. The expanding
volume of information, the increasing complexity of concepts, and the
demands for rapid application of knowledge to useful ends require an
increasing coordination of effort in the management of information.

Efforts this year revolved around enlarging the area in which the
Information Systems Division’s technology could be put to use. In a
cooperative effort with historians, researchers, and scientists our
computers and the technical expertise of our staff are joined to solve
problems. Like all technical contributions thus far invented by man,
computers represent an extension of man’s physical and mental capabili-
ties. Calculations, comparisons, and in-depth analysis that would
ordinarily cost many man hours, or even years of toil, can now be
accomplished in seconds with the help of a computer programmed to
the particular need. A few examples of this may be seen in the systems
developed this year for resarch in the fields of biology, paleobiology,
anthropology, botany, and the fine arts where time consuming tasks of
sorting, analyzing, and coordinating have been conducted by the com-
puter, freeing scientists and researchers to pursue more intellectual
activities based upon the information supplied by the automated process-
ing of data.

This was a year of major progress, for the Institution as a public
communicator. It began with establishment of the st motion picture
unit through a contract with Eli Productions. At the end of the year
we were engaged in discussions with the Corporation for Public Broad-
casting to support a number of productions, including our long-sought ;
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 27

definitive visitor’s orientation film. This obviously flowering relationship
with the cps is built upon a foundation with three primary components:
intellectual resources, the national collections, and a demonstrated
film-making capability.

Another aspect of film and television programs was represented by
the continuing conversations in which the Institution has been involved
over a period of months with regard to increasing our contribution to
public television in Washington and throughout the nation. Public tele-
vision, which itself is in an early stage of development in most parts of
the United States, appears to be moving toward a real accomplishment
with the support of the new Corporation for Public Broadcasting, as
well as from foundations and private companies. The Smithsonian,
with a continuing concern for the diffusion of knowledge dating to its
very origin, looks with great interest on future developments in this
area.

In the closely related field of educational radio, the Smithsonian
moved energetically during this year, once again combining an enhance-
ment of its own in-house capabilities and a most gratifying relationship
with the public broadcasting community. An educational radio service
designated “Radio Smithsonian” was established and began the con-
tinuing process of producing and making available recorded material
covering the full range of the Smithsonian’s enlightening and exciting
activities.

Coupled with development of the Smithsonian magazine, this evolu-
tion of our radio, television, and film programs helps to bring a new
dimension to the Institution in its ability to create channels from its vast
academic-cultural reservoir to people in their homes throughout the
nation.

Turning to another aspect of our public affairs, I believe it is clear
that the Smithsonian has during the past several years once again
assumed the central status within the Washington community, and
indeed the national community, that it occupied at least until the end
of the 19th century. There is a broad body of evidence that this is the
case. The Inaugural Ball for President Nixon in January, for example,
echoed the earlier inaugural festivities for President Garfield at the
A & I Building. Not only was the Museum of History and Technology
the scene of one of this year’s Inaugural Balls and other such celebra-
tions marking the start of a new administration, but the Institution was
also the scene of a number of farewell events for top officials in the
outgoing administration, including several members of the Cabinet,
and an unofficial farewell for President and Mrs. Johnson themselves.

Every department in the Cabinet held at least one, and in most cases
several, conferences, meetings or other events at the Smithsonian this
28 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

year, as did fourteen other governmental agencies ranging from the
FBI to the Weather Bureau to the Peace Corps. Fourteen foreign
nations—geographically ranging from Ceylon to Brazil to the Nether-
lands—sponsored or played a principal role in exhibitions or other
events. A considerable number of major national corporations, par-
ticularly in the areas of advanced technological and communication
fields, sponsored events in relation to Smithsonian exhibits or other
activities.

Can it be that the Smithsonian has a mission to make a real contri-
bution toward public understanding through a union of exhibits and
TV, as I have suggested earlier? Once television can be related to
everyday learning, once open education is understood for what it is, I
suspect that pedagogues will realize that like a mystical third eye—
the Buddhist concept of the survival of the pineal neural apparatus—
we may be able to translate aperceptive techniques into reality.

At present TV is merely floating on the edge of aperception, and
making money. But perhaps, that pale cyclopean staring eye, possessed
subjectively by everyone, in kitchen, bedroom, or parlor can be realized
to be merely in its infancy, the tin lizzie of what it could be for the
future, wedded to a continuing series of object-oriented exercises in a
neighborhood museum.

It is the mission of the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition
Service (SITES) to make the museum experience a living one to mil-
lions who do not come to the central setting.

A recent check of contracts with educational institutions in the
United States revealed that sires had sent exhibitions to 240 schools,
universities, or junior colleges in all of the fifty states in the last eighteen
months. It is becoming increasingly clear that s1rEs could render much
greater service all over the country if some subsidy could be found to
finance exhibitions for very small communities which cannot secure
the prorated costs of the most modest exhibitions. As a conservative
estimate, however, more than three and a half million people saw
Smithsonian traveling exhibits in the United States and Canada in
1969. These exhibits were of painting, sculpture, architecture, photog-
raphy, history, science, decorative arts, and children’s art.

An extension of the Mall institutions has been the Anacostia Neigh-
borhood Museum, described in detail in last year’s report.

This concept of neighborhood museums located in large urban cen-
ters where massive social, economic, and political problems abound,
gives direction and purpose to every division previously situated in the
central museum complex. The natural scientist, historian, anthropol-
ogist, and ethnologist can make their research and exhibits relevant
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 29

to current human situations. The neighborhood museum must meet the
practical needs of its community; indeed, its existence is predicated
upon the proposition that there are close-up, person-to-person tech-
niques to meet critical neighborhood needs. The neighborhood museum
must attract a significant number of neighborhood people at all levels
to insure its involvement and strengths. It should also make every effort
to analyze and interpret the history of its community.

This past year the educational programs, directed by Miss Zora
Martin, covered a broad spectrum from guiding children and adults
through exhibits and workshops for Community Reading Assistants of
the Anacostia Model School Project to special science units led by a
part-time teacher on loan from the District of Columbia Board of
Education.

In February of this year, the educational staff provided a well-
organized series of lectures, discussions, films, and dramatic perform-
ances for our celebration of Negro History Week. In addition to this,
the staff provided guided tours for the exhibit “The Sage of Anacostia,”
a graphic history of the Afro-American featuring the life of Frederick
Douglass. This was the most successful exhibit executed by the Anacostia
Museum and, undoubtedly, one of the most informative. It was attended
by approximately twenty-seven thousand metropolitan area school
children.

This year also saw the establishment of the museum’s Research Center
and Library for the purpose of furthering the development of the neigh-
borhood museum concept. The center will serve not only the needs of
Anacostia but a wider area as well. The Research Center and Library
is directed by Larry Erskine Thomas, the museum’s research and design
coordinator. The development of this research facility will enable the
community, the general public, and all who make use of its services to
understand the true significance of the black man’s social and cultural
environment and his influence on the progress of a great nation. The
Center has already consulted with and provided services to a wide
variety of museums and organizations as they seek to reshape their
programs and exhibits.

ASSOCIATED ACTIVITIES

The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars was estab-
lished by Act of Congress (P.L. 90-637) on 24 October 1968, to be
be “a living institution expressing the ideals and concerns of Woodrow
Wilson. . . . symbolizing and strengthening the fruitful relation
30 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

between the world of learning and the world of public affairs.” Congress
placed the Center in the Smithsonian Institution under the administra-
tion of its own fifteen-man Board of Trustees, subsequently appointed
by President Johnson and President Nixon.

The Trustees met at the Museum of History and Technology on
6 March 1969, and created an executive committee consisting of
Messrs. Humphrey, McPherson, Moynihan, Ripley, and Rogers. In
addition, they approved the selection of Mr. Benjamin H. Read, for-
merly Executive Secretary of the Department of State, as acting
director, and accepted with thanks temporary quarters in the Smith-
sonian Institution Building.

Concurrently, a contract has been let with Smithsonian Institution
planning funds under which the Urban Design and Development Cor-
poration, a new District of Columbia nonprofit corporation established
by the American Institute of Architects and headed by Mr. Ralph G.
Schwartz, will explore the feasibility of the recommended site for the
Center on the future Market Square at 8th Street and Pennsylvania
Avenue. The feasibility study is due on 1 September 1969.

The Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars has obtained
a $45,000 grant from the Ford Foundation to permit it to get started,
and an initial appropriation request of $100,000 for fiscal year 1970
has been submitted to the Congress.

A milestone in the life of our affiliated Institution, the National
Gallery of Art, has been the retirement, after thirty years of devoted
service of John Walker, the Gallery’s second Director. The Smithsonian
through its Secretary has served on the Gallery’s guiding Board since
its inception, and has watched with marvelling eyes, sometimes tinged
with human envy, the remarkable development of the collections under
his able hands. Would that other art collections in this city had been
able so to increase their holdings!

To his ability, must be added Mr. Walker’s prescience in the guidance
of the Gallery’s assistant director, Carter Brown, who now succeeds him.
We salute Carter Brown as a brilliant successor to the indefatigable
John Walker.

The “topping out” of the Kennedy Center’s massive steel framework
in September launched a year of continuing tangible progress for the
John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts. As the steel contract
was completed, the contract for the erection of hundreds of tons of the
marble from Italy for the building’s facing began, and the Center took
on a new look. |

Although construction proceeded at a good pace, the Kennedy Center
has not been immune to the meteoric rise in construction costs. In
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 31

October, Roger L. Stevens, Chairman of the Board of Trustees,
announced that an additional $15 million was needed in order to com-
plete the building. In the spring, after a private fund-raising campaign
was well along, Representative Kenneth Gray introduced H.R. 11249
in the House of Representative providing for an increased matching
federal grant to the Kennedy Center and an increased loan from the
United States Treasury.

Plans for the Center’s opening early in 1971 progressed as George
London assumed his position as Artistic Administrator last September.
In December it was announced that the American Ballet Theatre, one
of world’s foremost dance groups, would be the Center’s resident ballet
company.

Perhaps the most historic moment of the year was the announcement
last October that the Center’s Theater would be named in honor of
General and Mrs. Dwight D. Eisenhower. It was President Eisenhower,
of course, who initiated the Center in 1958.

More than a score of ancillary activities will be reported on in later
pages, not least of which is the development of the museum shops pro-
gram, the continued planning for a conservation-analytical laboratory
of major national proportions and our traditional program of exchange
of information through the publication of books and research reports,
the shipping of documents, and the maintenance of a conference center
at Belmont.

To the vital participation of the Regents this past year should be
added the special news of the reappointment for a six-year term of Mr.
John Nicholas Brown, citizen of Rhode Island, and the new appoint-
ment of Mr. Thomas J. Watson Jr., citizen of Connecticut.

These multifarious extensions of a central theme to “increase and
diffuse knowledge” are part of the Smithsonian. They form a core
of the knowledge industry which we attempt to generate. It will be
imperative in years to come that young people keep up with the chang-
ing world of technocracy. But this cannot be done by slave driving
pedagogical means. It must be done by waves of ambient illumination.
I do not know that this principle has been grasped as yet by sociologists
or economists. It has been intuitively grasped by the so-called “media”
professionals, but without a strong sense of commitment, except the
laws of individual enterprise. These are to some extent outmoded, how-
ever, hence the conflict and the tension of everyday life. It is our hope
in the Smithsonian to bridge this intelligence gap, for this surely we
Owe, as a consequence of our original creation.
32 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The annual meeting of the Board of Regents was held on 15 January
1969 at Hillwood, the home of Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post. Hill-
wood has been deeded to the Smithsonian Institution and the transfer
of the property and collections was formally accepted on this date by
Secretary Ripley on behalf of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution.

The spring meeting of the Board of Regents was held on 21 May
1969 in the Fine Arts and Portrait Galleries Building. This meeting
was the last one to be attended by Earl Warren, retiring as Chief Justice
of the United States and Chancellor of the Board of Regents. The
Regents unanimously voted the following resolution, a copy of which
was presented to Mr. Warren:

Earl Warren, Chief Justice of the United States and Chancellor of
the Smithsonian Institution: Your fellow regents wish to express their
deepest appreciation for your devoted friendship and extend to you
their warmest good wishes for the years ahead.

Financial Report

While the Smithsonian is a private institution, its private financial
resources are distinctly limited. Operating costs of its museums, art
galleries, and educational and research centers are largely met by annual
federal appropriations. The same is true for necessary construction
programs and, through the government of the District of Columbia, for
support of operations of the National Zoological Park. In addition,
federal appropriations of “excess” foreign currencies are granted to the
Smithsonian for the purpose of financing academic grants to various
universities and educational institutions throughout the United States
to enable the latter to carry out research studies in the related overseas
nations.

As a private educational and research institution, the Smithsonian
may and sometimes does receive a substantial volume of gifts, grants,
and contracts from private individuals and foundations and from fed-
eral agencies for the acquisition of collection items or the performance
of specific projects in areas of special Smithsonian capability. These
cover such diverse fields as the tracking of satellites in outer space, and
underwater exploration for oceanographic research and ecological stud-
ies here and abroad. Finally, earnings on the Smithsonian’s endowment
funds provide private fund income of moderate proportions.

For the year ended 30 June 1969, this category of financial support
for Smithsonian operating expenses may be summarized as follows:

Federal appropriations

Salaries and Expenses—normal activities $26, 443, 000
Special Foreign Currency Program 2, 316, 000
District of Columbia—Operation of National Zoological Park 2, 528, 000
Research grants and contracts (federal and private) 11, 400, 000

Private funds
Gifts (excluding gifts to endowment funds; entire amount _1, 987, 000
restricted to specific projects and hence unavailable for
general operating purposes)
Income from endowments and current fund investments 1, 365, 000

Total: $46, 039, 000

In addition, federal appropriations to finance construction projects
were received as follows:

35
36 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

National Zoological Park $ 300,000
Restoration and Renovation of Buildings 400, 000
Toward construction of Joseph H. Hirshhorn Museum and 2, 000, 000**

Sculpture Garden —_—_——_————_

Total: $ 2, 700, 000

**Plus $12,197,000 as contract authorization

Financial statements for the private funds, as audited by independent
public accountants, are shown below together with a statement of gifts
received in the current fiscal year.

The gifts received for both endowment and immediate program pur-
poses have been extremely helpful and are again gratefully acknowl-
edged. Major contributions included the $685,000 of funds received
from Cooper Union and the Committee to Save Cooper Union Museum
in connection with the Smithsonian assumption of responsibility for that

Museum; $150,000 from the Scaife Family of Pittsburgh and $75,000
from the Old Dominion Foundation for the Chesapeake Bay Center

project; Ford Foundation grants of $208,500 and $45,000, respectively,
for “Reading Is Fun-damental” and the new Woodrow Wilson Center
for International Scholars; $230,000 from the Morris and Gwendolyn
Cafritz Foundation for the new Calder setting on the Mall; and a
bequest of $235,000 and a valuable collection of hemiptera-heteroptera
from the Carl Drake estate.

The Smithsonian has been fortunate in securing increases in its
federal appropriations for operating purposes in recent years. For its
normal activities in fiscal year 1969, however, the increase amounted
merely to about eight percent. Increasingly severe federal budgetary
restraints are now seriously limiting efforts to keep up with the inflation-
ary rise in salaries and supplies, to meet the difficulty of accommodating
steadily rising numbers of visitors to our museums, and to maintain even
minimum support of research and educational projects.

Under these circumstances, private-fund support becomes doubly
valuable. The book value of private Smithsonian endowment funds
increased during the fiscal year by $1,740,000 (principally $1,250,000
gain on sales of securities and $437,000 from gifts), to a total of
$26,490,000 on 30 June 1969 (market value $31,800,000). The income
from roughly one half of these endowment funds is directed to the sup-
port of the Freer Gallery, and income from another one fourth of the
funds is restricted to other valuable endeavors in specific fields of re-
search and education. The remaining funds ($6,414,000) are unre-
stricted as to use of income; together with other investments in current
fund accounts they produce about $400,000 of income annually.

These private funds, even in such limited amounts in relation to the |
overall operating requirements of the Institution, are extremely valuable
in permitting experimental improvements, change, and modernization
FINANCIAL REPORT 37

in a variety of operating programs. It is essential to the future success
of the Institution that such private fund income be substantially in-
creased if the Smithsonian is to fulfill its mandate and keep abreast
of rapidly changing needs.

Some examples of a few specific large requirements for the immediate
future include purchase funds to expand our Chesapeake Bay Center
for Field Biology which is conducting fundamental ecological studies.
In addition we need building renovation and operating funds for the
Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative Arts and Design in New York
City. Finally we need funds to expand the Smithsonian Associates pro-
gram on a national scale. This pressing need for additional private
support has not previously been made known to our friends and well-
wishers. To this end, therefore, there has now been initiated an
expanded program to attract important private financial support. The
Institution will seek directed and unrestricted gifts, grants, and bequests
from private individuals, foundations, and corporations. Some success
has already been achieved. We intend to work harder.

The Board of Regents,
Smithsonian Institution:

We have examined the balance sheet of private funds of Smith-
sonian Institution as of June 30, 1969 and the related statement of
changes in fund balances for the year then ended. Our examination
was made in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards,
and accordingly included such tests of the accounting records and
such other auditing procedures as we considered necessary in the
circumstances.

In our opinion, the accompanying statement of changes in fund bal-
ances presents fairly the operations of the unrestricted funds of Smith-
sonian Institution for the year ended June 30, 1969, in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles; and, with respect to all other
funds, subject to the matters referred to in note 1, the accompanying
balance sheet of private funds and the related statement of changes in
fund balances present fairly the assets and fund balances of Smithsonian
Institution at June 30, 1969, and changes in fund balances, resulting
from cash transactions of the private funds for the year then ended, all
on a basis consistent with that of the preceding year.

on the accrual basis of accounting. Accounts for other funds are maintained on the
basis of cash receipts and disbursements, except that reimbursements for work
performed pursuant to a grant or contract are accrued and certain real estate is
carried at cost or appraised value as explained below.

Except for certain real estate acquired by gift or purchased from proceeds of gifts
which are valued at cost or appraised value at date of gift, land, buildings, furniture,
equipment, works of art, living and other specimens, and certain other similar
property, are not included in the accounts of the Institution; the amounts of
investments in such properties are not readily determinable. Current expenditures
for such properties are included among expenses. The accompanying statements
do not include the National Gallery of Art, the John F. Kennedy Center for the
Performing Arts, nor other departments, bureaus and operations administered by
the Institution under Federal appropriations.

Note 2. Commitment.—Pursuant to an agreement, dated October 9, 1967,
between the Institution and The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and
FINANCIAL REPORT 45

EARNING IS INTENSELY INDIVIDUALISTIC. Yet teaching is almost al-
L ways offered to groups. Formal education is organized for economy
of teaching effort, not for maximum learning. Like the formal set-piece
battle, which was the only way some generals knew how to fight, the
formal curriculum too often reflects the inability of faculties to teach in
any other way. The course given in sequence to a group of students
marching through it in tight formation for some predetermined interval
is obsolete. And so are school tours in museums if children are made to
stop obediently at successive stations to absorb doses of facts soon to
be forgotten. Educational programs must afford proper scope to the
rhythms of interest and respond to the directions of curiosity prompting
each student.

The basis of higher education within the Smithsonian is the mature
scholar conducting research in a field and helping to guide the efforts
of a student seeking greater competence. Starting this year, applicants
for educational appointments at the Institution have been asked not
only for records of previous achievement but also for essays specifying
their intellectual goals, enabling prospective supervisors to judge which
students will most benefit from the Smithsonian. Terms of admission
and the award of fellowship support are determined by steering com-
mittees of professional staff members, to whom these powers have been
delegated for the first time this year. Within each major field of study,
programs of associated tutorials and seminars are being developed to
foster more intensive exchanges of ideas and to serve community interests
of investigators whose work is related.

The summary of higher education for academic year 1968-69 is given
by each discipline, as follows:

In American Studies the equivalent of fourteen credit hours of instruc-
tion has been offered, including the graduate-level survey course in
American material culture, conducted by Harold Skramstad, a teaching
associate whose extensive knowledge of our nation’s development has
enabled him to draw widely on Smithsonian resources. Of the twenty-

49
50 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

six professional staff members whose primary concern is American his-
tory, four hold ancillary university appointments.
In Anthropology a total of thirty-two credit hours (equivalent) of

instruction has been offered and three PhDs and two master’s degrees

have been earned from the universities of students holding academic
appointments. Of eighteen professional staff members, two hold univer-
sity appointments.

A program in Cultural Studies is being established to serve the Insti-
tution’s scholarly enterprises in art and music history and the study of
folk culture. Three PhDs have been earned in this area and one master’s
degree, while the equivalent of twenty-one credit hours of instruction
has been offered by a total of twenty-three professional staff members.
Dr. William Gerdts has been appointed a teaching associate and has
conducted a graduate seminar on 19th-century American art in the
National Collection of Fine Arts.

In Environmental Biology, with twenty-three professional staff mem-
bers, of whom five hold joint university appointments, the equivalent
of eight credit hours of instruction has been offered, including the third

year of the spring lecture course in environmental biology, conducted in

cooperation with the D.C. Consortium of Universities.

In Evolutionary and Behavioral Biology (Tropical Zones) , the grow-
ing interest of biologists in unique tropical ecosystems and evolutionary
patterns has resulted in a group of excellent students taking advantage
of consultation with the Panama staff of seven scientists, of whom one
held a university appointment. Seven PhDs have been earned and a
total of forty-three credit hours (equivalent) of instruction have been
offered.

In Evolutionary and Systematic Biology, comprising the biological re-
search departments of the National Museum of Natural History and
sixty-five investigators, with twenty-four holding university appoint-
ments, the level of instruction offered has been equivalent to ninety-
four credit hours. Six PhDs and two master’s degrees have been earned.
Dr. Richard Boardman has conducted a widely praised seminar on
bryozoa, covering techniques of study as well as analyses of fine
structure.

In the History of Science and Technology, defined broadly to include
technology as applied to social needs such as agriculture, coinage, and
the postal system, the Institution employs thirty investigators, of whom
three hold university appointments. The equivalent of nineteen credit
hours of instruction has been offered and one PhD has been earned.

Museum Studies comprises three broad concerns of the modern mu-
seum: display systems including communications arts, reference sys-
tems including data management, and preservation systems including
OFFICE OF ACADEMIC PROGRAMS 51

all aspects of the analysis of materials. The program being developed in
this area looks beyond traditional approaches to museum training to-
ward a wider academic foundation. Internships at the grade level for
academic credit are now regularly arranged with George Washington
University and the University of Maryland.

Miss Joyce Perry, participant in the Office of Academic Programs’ 1969 Summer
Institute in Museum Display Systems has a lively discussion with a group of
inner-city sixth graders as part of an experiment in pupil reactions to museum
objects. Data obtained will be used in the development of new teaching exhibits
at the Smithsonian.

Almost any curator might be counted as a potential contributor to
the study of these practical museum arts, as well as a dozen or so staff
members for whom they are the primary professional commitment, as
is true for conservators and reference system analysts. One PhD and
one master’s degree have been earned. Dr. Robert Organ, director of
the Conservation Analytical Laboratory, has offered a course of lectures
on chemistry. The equivalent of eighteen credit hours of instruction
has been offered. Two staff members hold university appointments.

In the Physical Sciences, forty-seven of seventy research staff members
have held academic appointments, reflecting the close interdependence
of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory and Harvard University.
52 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

Fourteen PhDs have been earned and two master’s degrees. In all, the’

equivalent of 188 credit hours of instruction has been offered.

SCHOOL SERVICE PROGRAMS

The Smithsonian’s school tour program has provided almost 1,600.

escorted tours, serving more than 45,000 school students, in the Na-
tional Museum of History and Technology, the National Museum of
Natural History, and the National Air and Space Museum. At the Na-

tional Collection of Fine Arts 135 tours have been provided, serving’

4,050 pupils. Tours at the National Zoological Park have numbered
165, serving 9,390 children. Of these, 130 tours have been prescheduled,

and 35 have been unscheduled classes that docents have been able to:

assist once they arrived at the Zoo.

These tours have been made possible through the volunteer activities
of about 150 women recruited from many parts of the Washington
metropolitan community. By giving, on the average, one morning a week
during the school year, the volunteer docents are able to offer a wide
variety of tours in eighteen areas of the Smithsonian Institution.

A central scheduling office has now been set up for the tours, allow-
ing the instructor staff to devote more time to special class visits and
the production of educational materials. Mrs. Joan Madden has joined
the staff as Volunteer Representative and has greatly improved all as-
pects of scheduling. The number of volunteer docents has more than
doubled this year and the school tour total has increased by 235 per-

cent. Far more important than numbers have been the efforts to trans- —

form the tours into freer learning experiences. Within the National:

Collection of Fine Arts, for example, young children are encouraged to
act out their responses to works of painting and sculpture. Under the
guidance of Miss Susan Sollins the docents have worked up a remark-
able improvisational tour.

Exciting new departures in education were discussed for the entire
cadre of docents in a day-long meeting in May 1969: “Museum Edu-
cation Day,” which brought six inspiring speakers, who described ways
to use the museum as an effective environment for visual learning. At
an appreciation ceremony in June 1969 the docents were given a de-
lightful concert on period musical instruments, a wonderful example
of the museum come alive, which is of course the mission they seek to
perform for youngsters.

The Division of Elementary and Secondary Education “Tailored
Tour’ program has seen much activity during the year. This program,
one which provides carefully custom-designed museum experiences
OFFICE OF ACADEMIC PROGRAMS 53

planned in terms of specific needs of subscribing school groups, has
\continued to gain popularity among teachers and curriculum specialists
in the Washington, D.C., public, private, and parochial school com-
munity. During the year approximately 1,260 pupils representing forty-
jtwo schools have taken part in the program. Slightly more than fifteen
\percent of the Office of Academic Programs instructional staff time has
‘been spent in planning sessions with classroom teachers and in direct
teaching of visiting classes. Eight volunteer docents have been involved
iin implementation of certain of these special museum experiences when
‘the design was one that touched upon museum exhibits within the
scope of their general preparation.

In addition to a museum staff of instructors available to consult with
school people, the availability of two classrooms in the Division of Ele-
mentary and Secondary Education complex in the National Museum of
Natural History makes the tailored tour concept functional. This facility
‘permits discussions, use of various types of media, participation of visit-
ing resource persons, demonstrations, creative activities (such as clay
modeling, painting, creative writing), and other teaching and learning
techniques to be planned as part of a comprehensive teaching plan.

Groups participating in the tailored tour program during the past
year include the Model Schools Innovation Team, Pupil Personnel
Department Tutorial Program, United States Department of Labor
Day Nursery School, and Project Headstart.

The school service program introduces groups of young Americans
to educational opportunities outside of school that will be available
‘to them for life. In hopes of improving the effectiveness of museums
in providing educational experiences, the Institution has issued an in-

-vitation to encourage research by psychologists and others into the learn-
‘Ing process as it may actually be observed in our halls and galleries.
Effective learning necessarily involves pupils in active responses and
free discussion of exhibits, which can be studied for clues to questions
of interest and comprehension. To see children come alive with the
joy of knowing is to share in a museum’s greatest success. But as Hans
Zetterberg argues in his recent book, Museums and Adult Education,
there has been far too little discerning study of who comes to see what
and how they profit by it. Here the Smithsonian has a special responsi-
bility to sponsor studies that will be of value throughout the world of
education. An experimental student information guide program and an
invitational conference on innovation and relevance in museum exhibits
‘are other special activities devoted to this objective, which will also be
of primary concern within the higher education program in museum
| studies.
54 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

An acute shortage of financial resources has blocked expansion of

education programs for the past three years. Outside support from the

National Science Foundation, the National Endowment on the Hu-—

manities, the Junior League of Washington, and the Home Library
Foundation has helped to maintain the program level. Support for the
Third International Symposium has been generously provided by the
sponsors. The United States Congress has approved a centralization
of educational funding within the Office of Academic Programs, which

is expected to result in better communication of student numbers and .
program needs. More effective administrative procedures for scheduling

school tours, for making appointments in higher education, and for
certifying instruction to universities have been worked out and put into
effect, made possible by an unusually dedicated staff. Wilton S. Dillon,

a versatile social anthropologist who has seen distinguished service with —

the Phelps-Stokes Fund and the National Academy of Sciences, became
Director of the Division of Seminars in January 1969. He is ably as-
sisted by Mrs. Ruth Frazier. David Chase and Mrs. Grace Murphy
direct the production of the Washington Academic Calendar and other
special projects in urban and environmental affairs. Edward Davidson,
a paleontologist who has done much of the work for his doctorate within
the National Museum of Natural History, has joined the Division of
Graduate Studies as a Program Associate, bringing to it an intimate
knowledge of Smithsonian research.

Director Ritterbush has joined the deliberations of the working
group on intellectual] institutions of the American Academy of Arts
and Sciences-sponsored Commission on the Year 2000 and also a com-
mission on governance of universities cosponsored by the Academy and
the Danforth Foundation. He also has organized a symposium on the
relations of art and science to biological form for the annual meeting
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, has pre-
sented a number of scholarly papers. has addressed the sesquicentennial
of the University of Cincinnati (“The Educated Man in the Year
2000”), the silver anniversary observance of the National Science
Teachers’ Association (“Science Teaching and the Future”), and has
consulted on education with the governments of Israel and the United
Kingdom.

NE NEEDS TO HAVE ONLY SOME AWARENESS of the world around
him—and a conscience—to recognize that enormous, often
traumatic, changes of many kinds are demanding attention. Demands
for change in social institutions, reversal of environmental degradation,
and changing values in the face of rapid scientific and technological
advances provide us with challenges well beyond anything that has ever
been faced by civilized man. Directly and indirectly, the disciplines of
natural history can, and must, contribute to the solution of these prob-
lems. The first step in the application of science to human problems is
that scientists must care, must be concerned. The research staff of this,
the largest natural history museum in the country, increasingly reflects
a growing involvement with today’s problems in today’s world.

Perhaps the single concern of greatest magnitude is the accelerating
impact of man on his surroundings or, in many cases, the actual destruc-
tion of the environment. Formal direct action, through participation
in organizations of national and international scope, is evidenced by our
participation in such undertakings as the International Biological Pro-
gram, the Charles Darwin Station in the Galapagos Islands, the joint
effort with British scientists to protect the biota and habitats of Aldabra
Island. At the personal level, however, numerous individuals of the
research staff at the year’s end were: (1) planning a colloquium on the
threatened biota of Hawaii; (2) organizing preliminary exploratory
field studies of a starfish population explosion that threatens the coral
Pacific islands; (3) preparing for a reconnaissance of the Marshall
Island Test Area; (4) developing plans for massive biological research
programs in Southeast Asia that can serve as the foundation for an
expanded standard of living for the people of that area; (5) completing
plans for large-scale systematic studies in collaboration with ecologists,
geneticists, physiologists, and others concerned with the complexity and

potentials of the tropical forest ecosystem; and (6) conducting experi-
ments similar to those that will be used in our studies of the first lunar
samples.

If one is truly involved in current problem-solving, he realizes that
today’s research programs, by themselves, do not provide for the future,
even if they were adequate to meet today’s problems (and they are not).
This realization has produced an involvement by the Museum staff in
educational activities far beyond all expectations of a few years past.
High school students, doctoral degree candidates, scores of volunteer
workers of all ages, and serious visiting researchers use the facilities of
the Museum in ever-growing numbers. It is noteworthy that they come
not only because of the more than fifty million specimens that serve
as the documentation base for a full panoply of research but also
because of a vital research climate in the Museum.

With the increase of interdisciplinary use of the collections-tool, there
has been generated a vast demand for the information they contain. If
museums are to continue to serve a vital role in the biological research
process, they must contribute fully to the research-educational process
by making the collections and their accompanying data more accessible
to the community of scholars. Rising costs of collections maintenance—
along with large numbers of new materials obtained in the course of
major, large-scale biological programs—have discouraged, or even pre-
vented, museums from fulfilling this function as adequately as required.
Electronic data-processing techniques, though costly both in time and
money provide the means by which museums may meet these problems.
Under the direction of Donald F. Squires,” pilot studies have been under-
way for the last two years with the support of the Department of Health,
Education, and Welfare (HEW) and with the collaboration of the
Smithsonian’s Information Systems Division. The information that com-
prises the data base is derived from the collections of sea birds, marine
crustaceans, and rocks. Data recorded in the field and in the laboratory
are prepared in machine-readable form as a part of the specimen
documentation process, read into a computerized system of storage,
and retrieved according to the requirements of the researcher. The sys-
tems devised are now being applied in other parts of the collections by
the Museum and the future expansion into many of the national
collections is a long-term, high-priority objective that may serve as a
model for the entire museum community.

Application of the techniques of data processing to the enormous
bibliographic needs of biology is a closely related goal that is also being

research programs at the State University of New York at Stony Brook.
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 61

studied for future development. Already, the data base may be queried
successfully in specific areas, and at the end of the year a study was
underway of the economic factors involved—how much it costs to put a
set of data in the base and to retrieve that information.

One final example of the Museum’s deep commitment to the study
of fundamental human problems is provided by a Smithsonian-National
Institutes of Health program initiated several years ago to study the
occurrence of cancer-like, abnormal growths in lower animals. The
project has much potential significance to other larger, broad-gauged
research programs in the Museum, as well as to medical research on
tissue abnormalities. The implications and accomplishments of this pro-
gram are described later in this report by the project director, John C.
Harshbarger.

While major concepts in the understanding of disease processes (par-
ticularly in infectious disease, immunity, and genetics) have been made
in studies of the lower animal phyla, much of the work has been done
by independent investigations widely separated in time and location,
and very little coordinated support for bio-medical research has been
extended to animals below mammals.

In the field of oncology (the study of tumors) the paucity of informa-
tion regarding neoplasms in invertebrates has stimulated a search for
anti-tumor materials in these animals and some success has been
reported.

The thymic-dependent defense system of cellular immunity, which
phylogenetically appeared at about the level of the cyclostomes (lam-
preys), is claimed by some researchers to have evolved because of the
survival value it provided as a surveillance system against aberrant (neo-
plastic) cell populations. Neoplasia, therefore, must not have been much
of a threat to primitive animals and should be rare in the lower phyla
today.

The majority opinion, however, as to why neoplasia seems rare in
invertebrates and cold-blooded vertebrates is that these tumors are
seldom recognized and the small size of many of these animals dis-
courages autopsy even when illness and death is observed. Moreover,
there has been little attempt to survey lower animal populations specif-
ically for neoplasia since many zoologists discard abnormal specimens
in favor of more normal ones for study.

There was no center for the collection and study of the pathology
of animals in the lower phyla until 1965, when the Registry of Tumors
in Lower Animals was activated by the National Cancer Institute at
the National Museum of Natural History under a contractual arrange-
ment. The primary objectives of the Registry are: (1) to collect and
study neoplasms and related disorders of growth and form in inver-
62 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969 _

tebrate and cold-blooded vertebrates, (2) to serve to collect the per- ;
tinent tumor-related literature, and (3) to serve a liaison role among the
various workers in the field. Another, secondary objectve of the Registry
is to carry out field collections of neoplasms where these are of special
interest to pathologists. A study of epithelial papillomas of the mouth—
enzootic in white croakers off the coast of California—is in progress.
A study of invertebrates exposed to radioactive fallout at the Bikini
Atoll has just been initiated.

The Registry now has 244 accessions, only about one fourth of which
have been classified as neoplasms. Another fourth are problematic lesions
of indeterminate nature, illustrating the degree of difficulty experienced
in identifying disease processes in unfamiliar species. One half of the
specimens represent inflammatory, parasitic, reparative, developmental,
and other types of non-neoplastic phenomena.

One of the most valuable of the Registry’s accomplishments has been
the organization of an international symposium conducted at the Smith-
sonian Institution 19-21 June 1968. This was the first such symposium
devoted entirely to neoplasms of invertebrates and cold-blooded
vertebrates and the proceedings will be published (National Cancer
Institute Monograph 31).

Largely as a result of the Registry’s efforts, a reevaluation of the oc-
currence of tumors is being made. It is now recognized that neoplasms
occur in the vertebrates as low as the cyclostomes and that neoplasms
apparently comparable to those in mammals occur in insects and
mollusks. For example, in two laboratories transplantable, although
not invasive, growths have been found in the fruit fly, Drosophila
melanogaster. These tumors arise from the continual proliferation of
imaginal disk cells that have lost their ability for maturation. Another
transplantable tumor of Drosophila arises in the larvae of a specific
strain. In this case the larval neuroblast cells proliferate rapidly, in-
vade, and replace the host tissues. Because of the wealth of knowledge
of Drosophila genetics and the occurrence of polyteny in the salivary
gland chromosomes, these transplantable tumors are likely to become
valuable tools for the cancer researcher and the developmental biologist.

Since naturally occurring leukemias, epitheliomas, and a variety of
mesenchymal tumors have been found in oysters, mussels, clams, snails,
and crabs, one can begin to see potential advantages of cancer research
on these lower animals. Suspicion has been raised, for example, that
environmental factors will be found to explain the high incidence of
some neoplasms in particular populations of a species, which factors
may be of importance in explaining the distribution of cancer in human
populations. We already know that the epizootic of liver cancer in
hatchery-reared rainbow trout led to the discovery that aflatoxin, the
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 63

by-product of a fungus, was its cause, and aflatoxin is now under care-
ful scrutiny as a possible carcinogen in man. A similar situation is the
association of a herpes-like virus with the Lucké renal tumor (adeno-
carcinoma) of frogs. This animal s;stem is being used to obtain infor-
mation that may be useful in explaining the association of a similar
virus with the leukemic disease in Africans known as Burkitts’
lymphoma.

With the growth of aquaculture as a means of food supply, pathology
of marine animals is becoming a growing science. As greater numbers
of animals come under careful observation, it is inevitable that new
epizootics of neoplasia will be discovered and will require investigation
of their relationship to human disease.

Investigation of the natural occurrence of neoplasms in the lower
phyla eventually may enable us to make some generalizations concern-
ing trends toward higher incidences of neoplasia in species of more
recent evolutionary origin, in species with more numerous systems, or
in species with greater degree of specialization in particular organs and
tissues. A board overview of neoplasia on the phylogenetic scale is not
now possible, for the current state of knowledge covers less than three
percent of the animal species on earth and only about twenty percent
of evolutionary time.

The relationship of carcinogenesis to immunologic effectiveness is a
question that may prove more readily answerable by investigating lower
animals. The invertebrates offer special advantages because they do not
produce humoral antibodies—by classical definitions—but they do have
cellular responses that are effective in “recognizing” foreign cells and
may be effective in “recognizing” tumor antigens. Since these animals
lack antibody formation as a complicating factor, they represent a
simplified experimental system for study of cellular immunological
mechanisms.

The study of neoplasia in lower animals has enormous potential. The
Tumor Registry has taken the lead by putting together a collection of
specimens which demonstrate that neoplasms exist widely in the animal
kingdom. Primarily through this collection and the symposium held
last year, considerable interest has been stimulated throughout the
world. We should now proceed to use populations with endemic neo-
plasms to answer some of the pertinent questions of etiology and the
influences of environmental factors, as well as to expand our knowledge
of tumor formation in the lower animal phyla.

Although today’s problems seem staggering, they may be viewed as
opportunities for extending man’s understanding of the natural world,
which is the ultimate objective of the National Museum of Natural
History.

OFFICE OF SYSTEMATICS

Because of general budgetary restrictions in the National Museum of
Natural History, much of the activity of this Office has been directed
toward support of systematic research within the Museum, especially
innovative techniques.

The Office has continued to assist with the development and applica-
tion of data-processing technology to research problems by its support
of the type-registry project in the Department of Botany. The location
and status of type collections of plants constitute information that con-
ventionally requires a large investment of time and effort. The avail-
ability of a unified, computerized data-base—including such informa-
tion from the major botanical collection-centers—can ultimately release
very significant amounts of professional research time for more produc-
tive activities.

The Office has joined the Office of Ecology in sponsoring an inter-
national research study of a group of grasses, involving investigations
66 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969.

of their cytology, karyology, anatomy, and morphology. Such broadly
based projects have a large potential significance for an understanding
of the evolution and relationships of this, the largest and economically
most important flowering plant family.

The single most externally directed activity of the Office has been
the organization and execution of the third Summer Institute in System-
atics, held 23 June-11 July 1969. Again the National Science Founda-
tion jointly supported this highly successful series with the Office of
Systematics. The Society of Systematic Zoology and the Smithsonian
Institution were cosponsors and the Institute was held at the Smith-
sonian. The best, most provocative speakers available presented “lec-
tures” on a wide range of subjects: “The Current Diversity of System-
atic Methods and Philosophy” (Charles D. Michener), “Statistical
Approaches to Phylogenetic Approaches” (Lynn H. Throckmorton),

“Growth and Form in Systematics” (Stephen J. Gould), “Molecular

Systematics” (Morris Goodman), “Ecological Strategies and the Evolu-
tion of Ectoparasites” (Rodger D. Mitchell), “Behavioral Studies and
Systematics” (Howard E. Evans), and “Experimental Zoogeography”
(Daniel Simberloff). In addition to the twenty-five selected partici-
pants, many of the systematists from the Museum, from government
agencies, and from the Washington academic community attended
some or all of the sessions. As usual, the presentation of continuing

research projects by many of the participants in informal afternoon

and evening seminars was one of the important benefits.

Finally, the Office of Systematics has joined the National Museum

of Natural History in providing funds for the purchase of an exciting
new research tool, the scanning electron microscope, which was ordered
near the end of the year. Researchers in paleobiology, invertebrate
zoology, and botany, among others, eagerly await its arrival for appli-
cation in their studies.

Future efforts of the Office will be directed toward the establishment
of palynological research in the Museum and to the expansion of exper-
imental approaches to both the gathering and use of biological data
for solving the complex interrelationships of the natural world about us.

ANTHROPOLOGY

On 29 October 1968, the Office of Anthropology resumed its status
as the Department of Anthropology.

At the end of the year the River Basin Surveys were transferred to

the National Park Service as the result of negotiations between that
agency and the Smithsonian. Although administratively separate hence-

forth, many of its records and files have been added to the Smithsonian’s
National Anthropological Archives. Smithsonian anthropologists will
continue to provide scientific advice and on occasion may conduct re-
search studies under contract with the Park Service.

Departmental chairman Saul H. Riesenberg spent the summer of
1968 in research on Micronesian ethnohistory in the documentary ar-
chives of museums, historical societies, and libraries at New Bedford,
Nantucket, Martha’s Vineyard, and Providence. Most of the rest of
the year has been devoted to the description of the native systems of
navigation and to a remarkably involuted and circumlocutory mode
of speech and oral literature that occurs on Puluwat in the Caroline
Islands, where Riesenberg had done field work two years before.

incorporation in the Museum collections. This is an extensive collection
of prehistoric Dorset and Thule culture artifacts of stone, bone, ivory,
baleen, wood, and other material resulting from four seasons’ excava-
tions, conducted jointly with the National Museum of Canada at old
sites near Resolution Bay, Cornwallis Island, Northwest Territories.

Aided by a grant from the Wenner-Gren Foundation, senior eth-
nologist John C. Ewers has studied early examples of Plains Indian
painting and carving in museums in Paris, Stuttgart, Offenbach-Main;
Toronto and Calgary in Canada; and Rochester, New York. These
studies have been important in enlarging and revising his standard
work, Plains Indian Painting (1939), out-of-print for more than a
decade. The data will also be used in preparing a pioneer work on
Plains Indian carving.

A large part of a manuscript dealing with archeological field re-
searches during 1964—67 in central and southwestern Kansas has been
completed by senior archeologist Waldo R. Wedel. Concerned largely
with the historical and environmental background and with general
descriptions of the sites involved, the results of the four field seasons
of work will be combined into one monograph focused on the human
ecology and prehistory of the region, complementing his introductory
monograph on Kansas archeology published in 1959. The nature and ex-
tent of cultural contacts between the prehistoric and early historic Indian

populations of Kansas and their contemporaries in the Pueblo Indian
communities in the Rio Grande valley of New Mexico are becoming
clearer as the research in Kansas goes forward. There are archeological
indications that the semi-arid southwestern section of the state may have
been of greater importance to nonhorticultural, hunting peoples in pre-
historic times than it was to maize-growing peoples; farther east, with
increased rainfall and improved conditions for growth of domestic crops,
the reverse appears to have been true.

A research paper has been accepted for publication, based on studies
some years ago by Wedel and the late John R. Swanton, that presents
the documentary evidence concerning the route of the first European
exploring expedition under Coronado into central Kansas in 1541. Two
other manuscripts by Wedel are nearing completion—one dealing with
the hafting of stone scraper blades as revealed for the first time by
direct evidence gathered during 1965 field work, the second with
Pueblo trade pottery in the central Plains and its cultural and chrono-
logical implications.

Associate curator Eugene I. Knez has consulted with Sindhi scholars
and officials in the Lower Indus Valley, West Pakistan, to obtain views
and suggestions for initiating a binational research program on the
social implications of disappearing traditional crafts, industries, and
technologies. Most of the sketches, based upon field drawings, for his
70 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969 _

manuscript An Illustrated Study of Korean Material Culture, have been
compared by Knez in the South Korean village previously studied with —
the original objects. Supplementary information and maps have been
obtained to update the presentation of land ownership. His current
research activities include the preparation of a report on Ensign John
B. Bernadou, usw, a pioneer ethnographer in Korea, and a brochure
on Sindhi textiles, costumes, and accessories of West Pakistan.

Associate curator William Trousdale, who has served as assistant
director of the University of Michigan Expedition to Qasr al-Hayr in
central Syria, has worked on preparation of preliminary reports of the
third season of excavations that took place in June of 1968. He has been
in the field again this year for the fourth season of work at this early
Islamic site. He also has completed research on Hellenistic bronze mir-
rors in Egypt, at the Egyptian Museum in Cairo, and at the Greco-
Roman Museum in Alexandria. During the early part of the year, he
conferred with government officials in Kabul, Afghanistan, on plans
to conduct an ecological project in southwestern Afghanistan and con-
tinued his preliminary survey of this region. In September 1968 he
visited Bhutan to explore the possibility of arranging an exhibition of
the arts and crafts of that country to be shown at the Smithsonian and
at other American institutions. During the year Trousdale has completed
revision for publications of a work on the origin and diffusion of the
equestrian long iron sword in Asia. He also has completed papers on
Chinese jade, a folk tradition in Afghanistan reflected in a peculiar
manner of clipping donkey manes, and an inscribed Achaemenian stone
weight from the 6th-century-s.c. reign of Darius I, the first identifiable
Achaemenian find from Afghanistan.

In July 1968 Curator Clifford Evans and Research Associate Betty J.
Meggers, directors of the archeological survey of Brazil, with support
of the Smithsonian Research Foundation and in collaboration with
the Patriménio Histérico e Artistico Nacional and the Conselho
Nacional de Pesquisas, convened the eleven Brazilian survey partici-
pants for a two-week working seminar at the Museu Paraense Emilio
Goeldi in Belém. This second seminar of the program was held at the
end of the third year of field work to review current scientific results
and to select the regions for the remaining two years of field work. By
the end of the third year, twenty-three detailed regional chronologies
had been constructed, permitting relative dating of more than a thou-
sand archeological sites and extending from the pre-ceramic through the
Neo-Brazilian periods. A volume of preliminary reports by the survey-
participants, based on the second year of field work, appeared as a
publication of the Museu Goeldi in May 1969. A general summary of
the archeological cultures recognized and their distribution in time and
a MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 7A

space has been accepted by American Antiquity. A resumé of the results
was given at the 34th Annual Meeting of the Society for American
Archaeology in 1969.

In August 1968 Evans and Meggers met with Peruvian archeologists,
Ramiro Matos M., Hernan Amat O., and Hermilio Rosas L. in Lima
and Huancayo to review the results of the archeological survey train-
ing program for the central and north highlands of Peru, with special
reference to the Formative Period. Preliminary work has revealed
important early archeological sites in highland valleys at distinct alti-
tudes and in special ecological niches. A grant from the National
Geographic Society to the Smithsonian Institution for the Andean
Project in May 1969 will permit the work to move ahead. Evans and
Meggers went to Peru in late June 1969 to consult with the three
archeologists to coordinate the field research and to work out fiscal
matters.

Himba Wedding, an edited film in color and with commentary and
natural sound effects, derived from motion picture footage, slides, and
tapes obtained by curator Gordon D. Gibson during field work among
the Himba people in South-West Africa, was produced in 1969 under
Gibson’s direction. This ethnological document has been shown to
audiences at the annual meeting of the American Athropological Asso-
ciation in Seattle and at an anthropological film festival at Temple
University in Philadelphia. An annotated bibliography of anthropologi-
cal bibliographies of Africa, prepared under Gibson’s direction and now
in press, provides information on more than 800 listings of references
on the peoples, cultures, languages, history, and related human aspects
of Africa. This compilation is expected to be especially useful in the
development of programs of African studies at both the university and
secondary school levels. At the year’s end, he was writing up ethno-
graphic materials derived from field work, collated with such data as
is available from the published literature, on the Gciriku, a little-known
Bantu people who occupy the banks of a section of the Okavango River,
where it forms the boarder between Angola and South-West Africa.

Curator Richard B. Woodbury spent the summer of 1968 in New
Mexico doing research on the changing patterns of land use and
resource exploitation in the Zuni Valley, in collaboration with Mrs.
Woodbury. He has completed three manuscripts, which have been
accepted for publication. At the end of July 1969, he left the Smith-
sonian to become chairman of the Department of Anthropology at the
University of Massachusetts.

The first half of the year has been spent by associate curator Paul H.
Voorhis at the Mesquakie Indian settlement near Tama, Iowa, study-
ing the language of the Mesquakie Indians. He has spent the remainder

of the year analyzing the data collected and preparing it for publication.

After a year’s sabbatical leave as Fulbright Lecturer at Oxford Uni-
versity, curator William C. Sturtevant returned by way of Germany
(for the International Congress of Americanists at Stuttgart-Munich),
India (where he conducted brief field work on a system of artificial-
island agriculture in Kashmir), and Japan (to attend the International
Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences in Tokyo-
Kyoto). The remainder of the year has been spent in Washington on
research, and on planning connected with the new Smithsonian Center
for the Study of Man.

The first season of an archeological survey of Nejran, a major wadi
in the southernmost region of Saudia Arabia, has been completed by
curator Gus W. Van Beek. The purpose of the project is to determine
the extent to which the pre-Islamic civilization—often referred to as
Himyaritic Culture—penetrated this region from its center in Yemen
and South Yemen, and to assess the degree of its influence on the local
cultures of the Asir (along the Red Sea coast) and Nejran. Further-
more, the project should shed light on man’s use of his environment
by probing the nature and means of subsistence and the effects of trade.
Altogether, four pre-Islamic town sites have been recorded, three of
which are new discoveries; in addition, a mountain fortress of the same
period has been discovered in the Asir. The remains of ancient rock-cut

sluices for water control were investigated, and several hundred pre-
Islamic rock drawings and inscriptions were recorded. Field work
resumed in the autumn of 1969 in the wadies and on the plateau to
the north of Nejran. En route from his field work, Van Beek examined
ten archeological projects, financed by the Foreign Currency Program,
in Egypt and in Israel; he has prepared an evaluation of these projects
for the Office of International Activities of the Smithsonian Institution.

During the year, Van Beek, in collaboration with Mrs. Colyn Van
Beek, completed nearly one half of the manuscript and about one third
of the drawings of a volume entitled The Timna’ Temple. This volume
is to be published by the Johns Hopkins Press in the Arabian Publica-
tion series of the American Foundation for the Study of Man.

Associate curator Robert M. Laughlin has made two field trips to
Chiapas, Mexico, to prepare maps from aerial photographs of
Zinacantan, Chiapas. Working with local informants, he has pinpointed
on the maps 1,200 place names occurring in the community. This
material will form part of a Tzotzil-English, English-Tzotzil ethno-
graphic dictionary that now contains over 30,000 entries and that
presently is being prepared for computerization and editing prior to
publication.

74 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

In August 1968, associate curator William H. Crocker presented
two papers on taboo practices of the Canela Indians of Brazil to the
38th International Congress of Americanists in Stuttgart, Germany.
He then visited several museums in Western Europe in search of Canela
artifacts produced in earlier periods, and in February 1969 he went on
sabbatical leave to prepare for final field work with this savanna tribe
of the Brazilian planalto, which he has been studying since 1957.

Senior Physical Anthropologist T. D. Stewart, participated by invita-
tion in a symposium on Pleistocene Man in Asia, during the VIII
International Congress of Anthropological and Ethnological Sciences
in Tokyo and Kyoto, Japan. He gave a paper on the evolution of man
in Asia, and in the section on museology he also spoke concerning
methods used for exhibiting physical anthropology in the National
Museum of Natural History.

By arrangement with the Support Services, Department of the Army,
Stewart organized a seminar on Personal Identification in Mass Dis-
asters, which was held in the National Museum of Natural History in
December 1968. The 105 registrants included, in addition to some of
the country’s top forensic pathologists, a number of officers engaged in
identification work in United States Army Mortuaries around the world.

At the request of the National Park Service, Stewart assisted Erik K.
Reed, Park Service research anthropologist, in the identification of the
skeletal remains (which were believed to have been molested) of
Osceola, the leader of the Seminole uprising in the late 1830s. Osceola
died a captive in January 1838 at Fort Moultrie, Charleston, South
Carolina, shortly after George Catlin painted the portrait owned by the
Smithsonian. Upon opening the grave, the investigators found the
skeleton to be in a good state of preservation and to conform to the
available descriptions of Osceola.

In April 1969, Stewart presented a paper on the Laguna Beach man
at the annual meeting of the American Association of Physical Anthro-
pologists in Mexico City. The human skull described in this study is
the most ancient thus far recognized in America; the Carbon-14 age of
17,150 + 1,470 years was obtained from the bone collagen by Rainer
Berger of the University of California at Los Angeles.

Curator J. Lawrence Angel’s research on paleodemography and dis-
ease in the eastern Mediterranean has concentrated on extending the
story of man’s biological adaptation from the critical hunting-to-farm-
ing period transition up to the beginning of large cities. After the decline
in health of the early farming period, with its new disease incidence,
especially malarias, there was a considerable and steady improvement
from the third millennium to the first millennium s.c. Longevity rose,
despite stresses of childbearing; the death ratio of infants to adults

dropped; stature increased almost to the modern level; arthritis and
dental disease decreased; and anemia almost vanished, indicating dis-
appearance of falciparum malaria. This real biological advance was
reached at the time when the Olympic Games began and city states
flourished and struggled. Diet was adequate, with importation of grain
from rich soils in the Ukraine and adequate local pasturage still avail-
able for domestic animals. Population density was not overwhelming and
the socio-economic problems of slavery and warfare were relatively new
stimuli. With the development of cities like Rome, Alexandria, Antioch,
and Ephesus, health declined again. In the Eastern Mediterranean,
longevity, juvenile deaths, dental disease, and anemia all have returned
to approximately their higher Bronze Age levels. One of the villains
certainly is malaria.

In the bone biology laboratory, with support of a National Institutes
of Health grant entitled “Developmental Variations in Human Osteon
Chemistry,” the amino-acid analyzer nears completion, awaiting delivery
of a specially sensitive recorder for signals of color-intensity changes as
these traverse the spectrophotometer. When the laboratory is fully
equipped, it will be possible to determine the amino-acid composition of
single, excised osteons. Besides the application of this technique to the
76 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

study of age change, which Donald J. Ortner and David Von Endt are
developing, determination of changes in the ratio betwen amino acids
should provide a measure of time in dating of buried skeletons, espe-
cially where the protein is relatively protected, as in the enamel of
teeth.

Ortner, currently completing his requirements for the PhD degree
in physical anthropolgy at the University of Kansas, is working on the
developmental phases of the osteon in their relation to effects of age,
disease, and dietary deficiency in individuals ranging from birth to old
age. Pilot research, which indicates that the frequency of different types
of osteon is affected predictably by these three factors, opens new areas
of research in evaluating health status in ancient populations. This
research also will aid identification of unknown skeletons in forensic
osteology by helping to identify dietary or disease influences on the
physiological aging processes.

David W. Von Endt has focused on a third problem: to determine
the effect of external conditions on the rapidity of protein breakdown
and nitrogen loss from human bone buried for periods ranging from
several months to millennia. This project, supported by a Smithsonian
Research Foundation grant, depends upon strict standardization of the
Kjeldahl-Nesslerization method. Mrs. Barbara Fairfield has set up a
standard curve for known amounts of nitrogen with proper statistical
limits, has tested against this curve bone samples ranging from fresh
bone to archeological samples, and has started burial simulation experi-
ments using varying dry or wet heat levels to simulate decay over long
periods of time. With a theoretical nitrogen-decay curve, nitrogen
values from Byzantine, Roman, and Middle Bronze Age skeletons, as
well as those from wet sites in prehistoric Turkey and the eastern United
States, can be compared. Empirical observation on preliminary curves
last fall suggests that nitrogen loss is retarded under arid conditions in
Egypt and the southwestern United States.

Associate curator Lucile St. Hoyme has completed a manuscript on
the origins of New World diseases in which she has presented evidence
that organisms causing pathological changes in prehistoric American
Indian bones are probably native to the New World and not brought
with man from the Old. She also has begun the statistical analysis of a
large series of Maroon men, women, and children living in Mooretown,
Accompong, and other communities in Jamaica, measured in 1966 in
cooperation with Jane Philips of Howard University. Toward the end
of the year she was working with Richard 'T. Koritzer, a local practicing
dentist, on a survey of the etiology of caries, periodontal disease, and
other dental problems in American Indian, Egyptian, and other crania
in our collections.

M. Yasar Iscan from Ankara University is the first recipient of the
Ale$ Hrdli¢ka Memorial Scholarship. During the last half of the year
he has conducted a study of race differences in the pelvis, using skeletal
material from the Terry collection, which is an assemblage of remains
of people with birth dates ranging from the mid 19th century to about
1920. The results confirm the sensitive response of pelvic depth to nutri-
tion and show race differences that have not been clear before.

George Metcalf, museum specialist in the Anthropology Processing
Laboratory, supervised the excavation of a site in the near vicinity of
Volcan Arenal, Costa Rica, with the joint support of the National
Geographic Society and the Smithsonian Institution. He accompanied
William Melson, Department of Mineral Sciences, who is engaged in a
study of this volcano, which erupted last year for the first time in re-
corded history. It is hoped that data from the excavation of the site,
which was buried by an ash fall of a previous eruption, will allow dating
of the eruption that buried it.

Research associate Theodore A. Wertime was in the field from 29 July
to 26 September 1968 with a team of experts on a pyrotechnical recon-
naissance of Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey, a project that was financed
by a National Geographic Society grant and a foreign currency grant
from the Smithsonian Institution. The specialists from several different
countries included geologists, archeologists, metallurgists, a ceramicist,
and a glass expert. The team inspected old mines where gold, iron, lead,
zinc, and copper had been obtained in the countries visited. They pro-
cured metallurgical samples and slags at premodern smelting sites, ob-
tained old glass samples for analysis, and observed the survival of ancient
technologies and crafts in bazaars and small villages. The significance
of this pyrotechnological reconnaissance and the need to expand the
work into more detailed research projects is just now being realized as
some of the reports are being prepared.

The study of disappearing traditional crafts, small household indus-
tries, and technologies of South Asia has continued in collaboration with
the University of New South Wales, Australia, supported by funds
from Public Law 480, the Department of Anthropology of the National
Museum of Natural History, and the Department of Industrial Arts
of the University of New South Wales. Two independent field teams
have operated this year. One was in Ceylon, under the direction of
Leslie M. Haynes with J. M. Waddell as associate investigator, in coop-
eration with the National Museums of Ceylon and other officials. Field
data and craft objects have been collected, reflecting the arts and tech-
nologies that are rapidly changing as a result of industrialization and the
large tourist influx. Official Ceylonese bureaus have been very interested
in the practical aspect of the research in order to upgrade and to make
78 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

more authentic and accurate the crafts and arts of the various ethnic
and caste groups. In addition to Sinhalese crafts, attention will have to
be given to those of the minority groups, such as the Tamils and the
Muslims. Significant collections have been obtained for both the Uni-
versity of New South Wales and the Department of Anthropology.

The other team has spent a second field season in Pakistan, directed by
Donald M. Godden, assistant to the late Hans Wulff, with his co-
investigators, Charles Walton and Roswitha Wulff. Official cooperation
has been excellent, for the provincial government of West Pakistan
appointed a full-time staff member, who served as guide, interpreter,
and consultant, and the West Pakistan Small Industries Corporation
appointed a full-time liaison officer. Some of the most significant data
has come from northern states such as Swat and Peshawar. Fifty-eight
crafts have been investigated, a total of 339 artifacts have been col-
lected for the Smithsonian, and another representative collection has
been made for the University of New South Wales.

Research associate Victor A. Nunez Regueiro from Argentina has
spent the full year at the Smithsonian working with Evans and Meggers
as a fellow of the Guggenheim Memorial Foundation. He has com-
pleted the classification and has prepared a monograph on material
acquired during earlier field work in the Provinces of Misiones and Cor-
rientes, Argentina, in collaboration with the archeological studies going
on in Brazil under the Smithsonian direction of Evans and Meggers.
His site sequence correlates excellently with datable colonial European
artifacts from the sites, as well as with various dates in Spanish historical
documents.

Research associate Edwin N. Wilmsen, with National Science Foun-
dation support, has conducted a comprehensive study of the collections
and field data from the seven years’ work by the late Frank H. H.
Roberts, Jr., at the Lindenmeier site, Colorado. This is the largest and
best documented, but unstudied, body of material from an “early man”
site in the United States. Wilmsen will complete the work at Ann Arbor
where he will become curator of archeology at the University of
Michigan.

Research associate Olga Linares de Sapir has actively renewed her
earlier interest in the archeology of Panama and nearby regions. With
the appearance of two publications, her monograph Cultural Chronology
of the Gulf of Chiriqui, Panama and her article “Ceramic Phases for
Chiriqui, Panama and Their Relationships to Neighboring Sequences,”
the significance of this area to a better understanding of aboriginal cul-
tural development of Central America has been revealed.

The monograph An Archeological Survey of Southwest Virginia,
resulting from the research conducted by research associate C. G. Hol-

:
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 79

land, has been completed and accepted for publication in Smithsonian
Contributions to Anthropology. Holland also has conducted an archeo-
logical survey of the reservoir for two dams to be built by the Appala-
chian Power Company on the New River in southwest Virginia and
northwest North Carolina.

Ecuadorian archeologist Pedro I. Porras G. has spent a year in the
department with the support of the American Philosophical Society
and the Guggenheim Foundation. During this period he has classified,
analyzed, and described archeological materials excavated in the Baeza
region, Province of Napo-Pastaza, and in the Ecuadorian highlands.
The former area is significant because it sheds light on cultural connec-
tions between the highlands and eastern lowlands in pre-European
times. The abundance of obsidian artifacts and chipping debris from
the archeological sites, as well as a series of charcoal samples, has pro-
vided a basis for testing the correlation between these two independent
methods of dating and the relative sequence established by ceramic
seriation. Colonial pottery at several sites links the prehistoric with the
historic occupation, which is well documented by 16th-century chroni-
cles. A monograph on this culture, known as the Cosanga Phase, is being
prepared in collaboration with Evans and Meggers for publication.

Numerous college and high school students have worked on research
projects with staff members. John Bear, senior at the University of
Pennsylvania, has worked as a National Science Foundation summer
fellow to complete his report on Iron Age skeletons from Afghanistan;
D. Gentry Steele, a doctoral candidate at the University of Kansas, as
an NSF summer research fellow advised by T. D. Stewart, has worked
on the estimation of stature from incomplete long bones, using land-
marks on identified bones of people of known stature in the Terry col-
lection; Mrs. Catherine Wimsatt Mecklenberg (University of Wash-
ington), research fellow under Lucile St. Hoyme in the Summer Re-
search Assistant Program of the Smithsonian Research Foundation, has
worked on demographic and population analysis of a Virginia Indian
cemetery, interrelating cultural customs, disease, nutrition, and physical
differentiation in a study used as a master’s thesis.

Michael Blakey, sophomore student at Coolidge High School sup-
ported by a research grant from the American Dental Association
through Howard University, has worked on a correlation of dental and
facial structure with diet in American Indians from Florida (Canav-
eral) and New Mexico (Hawikuh), with the advice of Donald Ortner.
Reed A. Mathis, junior at Langley High School supported by the NsF
American University Training Program for high school students, has
worked with J. Lawrence Angel on aging and sexing techniques as
80 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

observable in sorting the Terry collection, and occasionally he has as-
sisted in the bone biology laboratory.

The Collections

Among the larger and more important collections accessioned and
placed in storage for study during the fiscal year is one illustrating the
traditional crafts of Iran, and another of the same type from West
Pakistan. Both were collected by a team headed by the late Hans Wulff
and Donald Godden of the University of New South Wales, Australia.

Also worthy of mention is a collection of 521 African objects collected
by Miss Genia de Galberg and one of 31 ethnological specimens of
carved wood from New Guinea. Three other important ethnographic
collections from Africa have been acquired: Walter Deshler of the Uni-
versity of Maryland has assembled examples of Tuareg clothing for the
Smithsonian Institution during a trip to the central Sahara; Miss Janet
Stone has sold to the Museum a group of carvings and ornaments that
she had acquired in Mali and Ivory Coast; and Miss Katherine Lavery
has donated a portion of her collection of masks and sculptures from
Upper Volta. A particularly important collection accessioned during the
past year has been that made by Province M. and Eleanor R. Henry
from the Paiwan and Atayal tribes of Taiwan. These are particularly
valuable in that the objects are accompanied by unusually complete data.
Also accompanied by complete records is a collection, mainly clothing,
made in several highland communities in Ecuador and archeological
collections from the Valdivia, Machalallila, Guangala, and Jambali cul-
tures of coastal Ecuador. Two other large, documented collections are
the Phebus collection of 2,912 items from California and the Hruschka
collection, 984 items, from Prince Georges, Charles, and St. Marys
counties, Maryland. The collections of named types of southwestern
sherds has been increased by additions from Mesa Verde National Park,
Gran Quivera National Monument, Jemez State Park, and from Casas
Grandes, Chihuahua, Mexico. Eleven accessions of skeletal material
have been added to the collections of Physical Anthropology during the
year.

In the Conservation and Restoration Laboratory more than 1,200
specimens have been processed. Both Joseph Andrews and Mrs. Bethune
Gibson have received certificates for completion of a course in the
chemistry of conservation. At the end of the year, Mrs. Gibson was in
London attending a course sponsored by the British Council on the con-
servation of antiquities.
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 81

Effective 1 November, 1968, the archives of the former Bureau of
American Ethnology and the former Smithsonian Office of Anthropology
were designated the Smithsonian Institution National Anthropological
Archives. This documentation center will preserve, and encourage the
preservation elsewhere, of records that document anthropological re-
search and the history of anthropology. The Archives now serve as a
repository for field notes, photographs, and personal papers of anthro-
pologists throughout the world, whatever their topical or geographical
specialties, as well as the records of anthropological societies and
organizations.

Exhibits

At the request of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York,
curator Van Beek prepared an exhibition of pre-Islamic South Arabian
Art, which was shown there from 23 March to 10 May 1969. The
objects were selected from the finest collection of South Arabian an-
tiquities in the world, owned by the American Foundation for the
Study of Man (Wendell Phillips, President). This collection is on loan
to the Smithsonian Institution for purposes of research and exhibition.

During the winter and spring Van Beek coordinated activities and
arrangements as curator-in-charge of the mammoth exhibition, ‘“Mas-
ada.” The Washington showing is jointly sponsored by the Washington
Jewish Foundation and the Smithsonian Institution with active support
by the Embassy of Israel. The exhibition deals with events that took
place at the Herodian fortress overlooking the Dead Sea in Israel,
where in a.D. 73 a group of 953 Jewish zealots chose to commit suicide
rather than submit to Roman slavery or death. It weaves together the his-
torical narrative of the contemporary Jewish historian Flavius Josephus
with the results of the archeological excavations and vividly presents
the story of Masada by means of graphics, objects, models, slides, and
tape recordings. In addition, a portion of the exhibition deals with finds
recovered from caves on the west side of the Dead Sea from the period
of the Second Jewish Revolt, a.p. 132-135. The exhibition was opened
formally by Chief Justice and Smithsonian Chancellor Earl Warren,
who was presented a bronze plaque in honor of his indefatigable service
in the cause of human freedom and the furtherance of civil rights.

A new exhibit on Yoruba textiles and clothing has been conceived and
written by Mary S. Thieme. Mrs. Thieme, who was granted a Museum
internship for the year by the National Foundation for the Arts and
Humanities, prepared her script under the general scientific supervision
82 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

of Gordon Gibson. The exhibit was installed in the Hall of the Cultures
of Africa and Asia in June 1969.

Much of John C. Ewers’ time during the winter and spring has been
devoted to planning two special exhibitions. One, entitled “Jean Louis
Berlandier, a French Scientist among the Indians of Texas 140 Years
Ago,” opened in March 1969 to coincide with the publication by the
Smithsonian Institution Press of Berlandier’s The Indians of Texas in
1830. A larger exhibition, “The Indomitable Major John Wesley Powell,
Scientific Explorer of the American West,” will comprise the Smith-
sonian’s major contribution to the observance of the Powell Centennial
Year of 1969. It will present Powell’s remarkable and varied career as
an important contributor to both basic and applied science and as a
scientific administrator in government.

Research and laboratory activities at the Lincoln, Nebraska, head-
quarters have continued during the year at an attenuated pace owing
to reduced staff and budget. The large-scale program of field records
microfilming initiated in fiscal 1968 has been completed after photo-
graphing and indexing over 3,700 sites. Laboratory personnel have con-
tinued processing specimens that now number well over 1.75 million.
Staff archeologists have concentrated on interpretation and synthesis
of data from a number of major excavated sites, chiefly in the Dakotas.

Five monographs by River Basin Surveys scientists have appeared in
the Publications in Salvage Archeology: “Big Bend Historic Sites,” by
G. Hubert Smith, delineated certain aspects of early social and com-
mercial history of central South Dakota; “Bibliography of Salvage
Archeology in the United States,” by Jerome E. Petsche, was published
with the fiscal aid of the American Council of Learned Societies and the
Committee for the Recovery of Archaeological Remains; “The La
Roche Site,” by J. J. Hoffman, discussed late prehistoric cultural con-
tinuities in the middle range of the Missouri River; “Big Horn Canyon

Four River Basin Surveys field parties have operated within the Mis-
souri Basin during the year:

1. A three-man party has spent three weeks in shoreline survey of
Big Bend Reservoir, South Dakota, in order to locate newly exposed
sites and survey damage to known occupations. This activity has been
carried out in cooperation with the South Dakota State Historical Society
and the W. H. Over Dakota Museum of the University of South Dakota.
New information has been gathered that appears to show a potential
relationship between prehistoric occupations, soil horizons, and climatic
interpretations.

2. One man has spent two days surveying prehistoric hunting camps
in the southern Couteau du Missouri of South Dakota to assess their
relationship to major village sites in Fort Randall Reservoir.

3. An eight-man party has spent nine weeks in the third and final
season of excavation at South Cannonball Village in the upper Oahe
Reservoir of North Dakota. Two additional structures, one of possible
ceremonial function, have been uncovered, as well as several interhouse
utility and storage areas. The accumulated data from this site promises

to reveal important information regarding early village horizons on the
Northern Plains.

4. Again in cooperation with the W. H. Over Dakota Museum, a
fourth party has made test excavations at Ludlow Cave, South Dakota,
to determine feasibility of re-investigation. Tests have revealed that the
critical cave deposits are far too despoiled to warrant further action.
The same party has spent one week in a shoreline reconnaissance of
Bowman-Haley Reservoir, North Dakota, pursuing previous investiga-
tions of McKean Complex occupations in this area.

For the second consecutive year two Smithsonian Institution-National
Science Foundation undergraduate summer research assistants have
participated in River Basin Surveys field operations. ‘The students, from
the University of North Carolina and Wake Forest University, were
assigned to the field party excavating the South Cannonball Village,
where they gained a thorough grounding in excavation technique,
methodology, and management of site data. At the end of the season
they returned to Lincoln, where they familiarized themselves with
technical operations of the laboratory and office. A manuscript com-
piled by st-NsF summer research assistants last year was published
during the year as an article in the Plains Anthropologist; it described
a salvaged site in Oahe Reservoir and synthesized the data with previous
reports.

At the close of the year the field season was well underway. One
archeologist, on detail with the National Park Service, conducted nine
days of excavation at Fort Laramie, Wyoming, with a five-man crew
for the purpose of salvaging remains in advance of construction. A nine-
man crew, under the direction of an archeologist on detail to the
National Park Service, was engaged in major excavations at Fort
Union, North Dakota, preparatory to reconstruction of this famous
historic trading post.

BOTANY

The main thrust of research in the department continues to center on
tropical floras. Curator J. J. Wurdack has nearly completed a study of
the Melastomataceae for the Flora de Venezuela. He has also completed
92 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969 —

revisions of the Polygalaceae and Melastomataceae of Guayana and the —
Brazilian Planalto and Tibouchina sect. Barbigerae. The flora of
Santa Catarina, Brazil, and preparation of manuscript on the Bromeli-
aceae for Flora Neotropica contiune to occupy the attention of senior
botanist L. B. Smith. A revision of the Acanthaceae for the Flora of
Santa Catarina has been completed by assistant curator D. Wasshau-
sen. These long-term studies have clarified the taxonomy and evolution
of several large tropical families.

The largest of all plant families, the Compositae, is being studied by
associate curator H. E. Robinson and collaborator R. M. King by an
application of micro-morphological research techniques. A number of
previously unrecognized relationships have led to the description of
both new species and new genera. Research associate J. Cuatrecasas
has continued field and herbarium studies on the flora of Colombia,
especially the Compositae, with emphasis on cytological surveys.

Further expanded studies on the flora of Dominica have been made
possible through the generosity of Mrs. William J. Morden. A Morden-
Smithsonian expedition of three weeks’ duration has surveyed the newly
developed logging areas, with Mrs. Morden, D. H. Nicolson, R.
DeFilipps, and M. E. Hale participating. It is hoped that a basic under-
standing of vegetational change after logging can be gained that will
lead to more intelligent land utilization. Curator M. E. Hale has made
the first extensive lichen collections. Surprisingly, two crustose families,
the Graphidaceae and Thelotremataceae, comprise almost half of the
lichen flora and show a high degree of speciation. Under the Bredin-
Archbold-Smithsonian Biological Survey of Dominica, D. H. Nicolson
and collaborator R. DeFilipps have made considerable progress on the
final manuscript of the Dominican flora.

Botanical interests in Old World tropical plants by the staff are
increasing: D. H. Nicolson has visited Mysore State in India to initiate
a collaborative project with C. J. Saldanha. Curator V. Rudd has begun
a revision of Ceylonese legumes in preparation for field work there.
Associate curator T. R. Soderstrom has begun to make similar back-
ground studies of the grasses of Ceylon. Three staff members have
worked in Africa: associate curator W. R. Ernst has carried out some
field work in Morocco and explored possibilities of future involvement
in the flora of North Africa. T. R. Soderstrom has collected grasses in
Tunisia and consulted with local botanists in developing a program on
agrostology. Associate curator E. S. Ayensu has conducted field work
in Tunisia and Ghana in continuation of his anatomical studies on the
yam family (Dioscoreaceae). |

Associate curator Stanwyn G. Shetler has nearly completed his mono- —
graph on the variation and evolution of the circumpolar Campanula —
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 93

rotundifolia complex and intensified his planning efforts, as project
secretary, for the long-term Flora North America Project. General pro)-
ect definition has been completed in order that the necessary resources
could be sought; the pilot phase of the automated bibliography, includ-
ing the perparation of a trial data base and full documentation, has
been completed; a computer analysis has been made of worldwide
herbarium resources, and the main results of this study are being
published.

Associate curator E. S. Ayensu has assembled equipment needed for
the newly developed technique of cinematography for study of stem
anatomy. Successive serial sections of stems are photographed with a
movie camera and made into a film. Analysis of the four-minute film
strips has helped unravel complex nodal anatomy of xylam and phloem
glomeruli in the yams and related monocotyledons. Associate curator
R. H. Eyde has begun collaboration with C. C. Tseng of Windham
College, Vermont, on a comparison of floral structures in the Araliaceae,
which it is anticipated will lead to a better understanding of the evolu-
tionary relationships of the family.

Curator C. V. Morton has finished a major work on the ferns of the
Galapagos Islands. He spent June 1969 furthering studies on fern type
specimens at herbaria in England.

Curator M. E. Hale has begun a monographic revision of the lichen
family Graphidaceae with research assistant B. J. Moore. The basic
approach is to analyze a large, highly speciated group by comparing
morphological and chemical features. Thin-layer chromatography is
being employed and microscopic sections of fruiting bodies have been
prepared.

Research associate F. Raymond Fosberg, assisted by Marie-Héléne
Sachet, has been engaged in various activities concerning insular floras
and ecology, ranging from the western Indian Ocean eastward to the
Marquesas and Hawaiian islands. The new genus Lebronnecia (Mal-
vaceae) , discovered during the course of these investigations and almost
extinct in its native habitat in the Marquesas Islands, has been success-
fully brought into cultivation in Tahiti and is now flowering. It will
now be possible to go much further in clarifying relationships of the
genus than has been possible from material heretofore available for
study.

Fosberg was chairman of the meeting on conservation in the Pacific
Islands held by the Conservation-Terrestrial Section of the International
Biological Program in Palau and Guam in November 1968. Attention
was focused at the meeting on a number of serious threats to both ter-
restrial and marine island ecosystems and strong recommendations were
made to the governments involved to take remedial measures. A pro-

posal was advanced to preserve as scientific reserves a number of unin-
habited islands under international jurisdiction.

Work is progressing on the floras and vegetation of Aldabra and
neighboring atolls in the western Indian Ocean, where a surprising
number of new plants and interesting distributional relationships have
been revealed. Other coral island studies are in progress and fifteen
numbers of the Atoll Research Bulletin have been edited and published,
making recent information available to students of coral islands and
reefs. The scope of the Bulletin has been broadened somewhat to
include tropical oceanic islands other than low coral islands.

The revision of Trimen’s Handbook to the Flora of Ceylon is making
substantial progress. Ten specialists have worked in the field during
the year and important collections have resulted. A number of drafts
and one final manuscript have been submitted.

Dieter Mueller-Dombois, of the Ceylon Ecology Project, has com-
pleted his own studies, resulting in vast amounts of information es-
pecially on Ruhuna and Wilpattu national parks and on the “patana”
grasslands of the Ceylon mountains. Vegetation, soils, geological, and
animal activities maps of the two national parks have been prepared and
are in course of publication. A climatic map of the island, with ac-
companying text, has been published.

The department has been host to two postdoctoral fellows, Hui-Lin

Li (Morris Arboretum, Philadelphia), who is completing studies on the
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 95

flora of Taiwan, and Elias de la Sota (La Plata, Argentina), who is
studying the ferns of Argentina.

The staff has continued to participate in Smithsonian Associates
activities, this year emphasizing a series of nature walks coordinated by
S. G. Shetler.

A one-day conference was held in the department in early May 1969
on automation of herbarium collections. Six participants from large
herbaria (T. Crovello, H. Irwin, W. H. Lewis, J. Mickel, D. J. Rogers,
and J. Soper) attended and ten others joined the discussions. This is
the first time that such a group has assembled to broadly assess the
status and possible directions of automation in the herbarium.

The Flora North America Editorial Committee met for four days in
late April and early May 1969. Discussions centered on progress so far in
literature automation (S. G. Shetler) and the overall philosophical base
for the flora (P. Raven). Organizational problems also were discussed.

The Collections

Field work by staff members has been carried out in Columbia (J.
Cuatrecasas, H. R. Soderstrom), in Dominica (D. H. Nicolson, M. E.
Hale), in Mexico (V. Rudd), in Morocco (W. R. Ernst), in Tunisia
(E. S. Ayensu, T. R. Soderstrom) , and in the United States and Canada
(M. E. Hale).

Additions of Old World collections have continued in significant
quantities: 1,474 Nepalese plants (through P. R. Pande), 1,278 Tai-
wanese plants (through Hui-Lin Li), 1,067 samples of Australian woods,
1,329 African collections, and 895 Philippine plants. Important collec-
tions of Neotropical plants have been received in exchanges with the
New York Botanical Garden, the University of California at Los Ange-
les, Stanford University, Texas Research Foundation, Gray Herbarium,
and the Field Museum.

A continuing problem has been the curating of the large new ac-
cessions. While 26,550 specimens have been mounted during the year,
approximately 38,000 that should be mounted have been received, leav-
ing an unmounted backlog of about 12,000 specimens.

All outstanding loan records have now been computerized to provide
more complete access and flexibility in updating. Exchange records are
being treated in a similar way in order to gain a better overall view of
the directions of our exchange program.

The Type Register, a cooperative, long-term, computer-based project
to collect all available information on the types in the herbaria of the
United States, has received support from several sources during the
96 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

year. More than 2,000 entries are on magnetic tape and another 3,000
wait for input. A trial sending to other herbaria of the information
on types of Mzmulus species has been made to prove out the systems
design. Response has been generally favorable and the broad design of
the project is being reassessed for future development.

Finally, the extensive and valuable research materials of the great
tropical family Piperaceae (peppers) have been received as a bequest
from T. G. Yuncker, through his wife.

ENTOMOLOGY

Planning and supervision of the move of the Department of Ento-
mology from the Lamont Street building to the Natural History Build-
ing has seriously impaired research productivity during the year.
Personnel of the Divisions of Coleoptera, of Lepidoptera and Diptera,
and of Hemiptera and Hymenoptera have devoted large blocks of time
to planning for renovation of assigned areas, packing, moving, and
unpacking of collections and equipment at the new location. Approxi-
mately a third of the staff and collections remain to be moved during
next year. In spite of the time lost to the move, the Department has had a
reasonably productive year: staff specialists have published thirty-one
papers totaling more than five hundred pages.

The Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program Advisory Council has
recommended approval of the departmental proposal for a four-year
biosystematic study of selected groups of Ceylonese insects. If the
project is approved by the Ceylonese government, the field work will
begin during the next fiscal year.

Curator Oscar L. Cartwright has continued his revisional studies in
the scarabaeid subfamily Aphodiinae and has made progress on several
faunal studies of other scarabaeids. Much of Paul Spangler’s time has
been devoted to planning and supervising the divisional move to the
Natural History Building, but he has made some progress on his water-
beetle studies. In February 1969 he began nearly seven months of field
studies on water beetles in a number of countries in South America and
the West Indies.

Associate curator Richard C. Froeschner has spent three months
studying lace-bug types in museums in ten European countries to con-
firm or correct the generic assignment in connection with his manual
of world genera, on which substantial progress has been made; he also
has continued work on certain families of Hemiptera for the report on
the Bredin-Archbold-Smithsonian Biological Survey of Dominica.

Chairman Karl V. Krombein has completed a paper on North
American cuckoo wasps describing two new genera and a new species
with biological notes. He also has devised a new trap to attract wood-
102 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

nesting solitary wasps and bees and has made satisfactory field tests
of it during a three-week period at the Archbold Biological Station in
Florida. Gerald I. Stage has analyzed initial population samples of
Lysimachia pollinators in the local area and has realized progress on
three manuscripts dealing with pollinators and pollination of Eucnide
and Mentzelia.

Senior entomologist J. F. Gates Clarke has completed his large sys-
tematic and ecological survey of the lepidopterous fauna of Rapa
Island. He left in May 1969 for four months of museum study in
Leiden and London in connection with a similar treatment of the
microlepidopterous fauna of the Marquesas Islands.

Associate curator Donald R. Davis has substantially advanced his
monograph of Nearctic Tineidae and has nearly completed the re-
vision of American Incurvariinae. His tineoid studies have been ad-
vanced by two months of study at the British Museum.

Associate curator W. Donald Duckworth has expanded his studies
of stenomid reclassification by investigating genera of the Old World
Tropics in order to assess the zoogeographical trends. His pioneering
work on the Neotropical fauna has been advanced greatly by three
months of collecting in Colombia, Venezuela, and Guyana.

In the relatively limited time available after moving his division,
William D. Field has made some progress on revisions of the butterfly
genera Phulia and Vanessa and has added 5,000 entries to his catalog
of New World Lycaenidae. Field, with the assistance of divisional
preparator Vira Milbank, has added 5,600 titles to the divisional
bibliography of Lepidoptera.

Summer fellow Robert E. Dietz IV, working under Duckworth, has
completed research on the ctenuchid genus Horama for his MS degree
at Cornell University.

Ralph E. Crabill has made collections and ecological observations of
centipedes during two field trips in eastern Tennessee and adjacent areas
and to type localities in Virginia and North Carolina. Crabill has com-
pleted a number of manuscripts during the year and has nearly finished a
generic reclassification of the Mecistocephalidae and a faunal study of
the Nepalese centipedes.

Oliver S. Flint, Jr., has made substantial progress on a revision of a
subfamily of Central American microcaddisflies and on faunal reports
of large collections of caddisflies from the Amazon basin, Surinam, and
Chile. An early collecting trip of two weeks in southern and central
Arizona has provided Flint an opportunity to obtain valuable specimens
and information concerning the relationship of the Arizona fauna with
related areas in Mexico. His previous studies of West Indian caddisflies
were aided at the end of the year by four weeks of collecting in Puerto
Rico and the Dominican Republic.

The talented staff artists, Mrs. Elsie H. Froeschner and André Pizzini,
have provided illustrations for a number of manuscripts, but the depart-
ment still lacks adequate support in this area to match the research
productivity of its specialists.

The Southeast Asia Mosquito Project (SEAMP), a cooperative Smith-
sonian and Department of the Army project under the direction of
Botha de Meillon, has continued work on the systematics of mosquitoes
of that vast and medically important area. Prior to his retirement,
John E. Scanlon collected mosquitoes in Southeast Asia and studied
types of Oriental anophelines at the British Museum. E. L. Peyton and
Yiau-Min Huang also have studied the mosquito collections at the
British Museum. sEAMP consultants Peter F. Mattingly, Kenneth L.
Knight, J. Bonne-Wepster, J. M. Klein, Thomas Zavortink, and John F.
104 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969. —

Reinert have continued their taxonomic studies of various mosquito
genera.

Several resident research associates have continued to work actively
on systematic studies in their own areas of interest. Mrs. Doris H. Blake
has nearly completed her worldwide revision of the chrysomelid genus
Metachroma, and visited the Museum of Comparative Zoology twice
during the year to study types. K. C. Emerson has made progress on
taxonomic studies of the Anoplura of Nepal, Nigeria, Madagascar,
Senegal, Pakistan, and Botswana and of the Mallophaga of Nepal, Vene-
zuela, and Southeast Asia; many of the specimens have been collected
by personnel of the Division of Mammals. C. F. W. Muesebeck has
completed his large revision of the Nearctic species of the braconid genus
Orgilus and has continued his valued services as translation editor of
the Russian journal Entomological Review. Robert Traub has continued
his work on the ecology of viral and rickettsial infections based on the

plants in rain forest near
Florencia, Colombia.

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 105

rodent hosts and their ectoparasites. He hypothesizes that these data can
be used to determine the geographic extent of scrub typhus infection
and to indicate where it may be expected to occur. He is also collab-
orating on the preparation of a glossary of scientific terms for the Cata-
logue of the Rothschild Collection of Fleas and has spent three months
collecting mammals and their ectoparasites in New Guinea.

Departmental specialists have received several honors and awards.
Duckworth was elected vice chairman of Section A (Systematics, Mor-
phology, and Evolution) at the annual meeting of the Entomological
Society of America. Spangler has been elected vice president of the
Society for Study of Coleoptera. Stage has been appointed to a three-
year term as secretary of the Society of Systematic Zoology. Krombein
has been elected president of the Entomological Society of Washington,
reelected vice president of the Washington Biologists’ Field Club, and
has been appointed a chief biomedical scientist in the United States
Air Force Reserve.

The Collections

The National Collection of insects has received more than 460,000
specimens during the year, bringing the total holdings to 18,712,627.
As usual, many of the new accessions have been of great significance in
that they filled gaps in regional representation, contributed directly to
continuing research programs of staff members and associates, consisted
of reared specimens with associated immature stages, or were of eco-
logical importance because of associated data on habitat, relationships
with other organisms, and so forth.

There have been some extremely valuable accessions from staff mem-
bers as a result of past field work. Notable among these are 10,953
specimens from Argentina and Chile collected by Oliver S. Flint, Jr.;
10,788 from Arizona collected by Flint and A. S. Menke, uspa (United
States Department of Agriculture) ; 13,609 from the Marquesas Islands
by J. F. Gates Clarke and Thelma Clarke; and 2,679 from Plummers
Island, Maryland, by Paul J. Spangler. Flint’s Chilean caddisflies have
been put to immediate use in his continuing study of the Chilean fauna,
and the Arizona specimens have provided valuable insights into the
relationship between the Arizona and Mexican faunas. The Clarkes’
accession have been particularly strong in Microlepidoptera and espe-
cially important because of the material reared by Mrs. Clarke; he is
currently engaged in working up the Marquesan fauna through study
of types in the Leiden and British museums.

366-269 O—70-—_8
106 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

Several accessions have been most welcome inasmuch as they consti-
tute material from areas previously represented very poorly, if at all,
in the National Collection. A collection of Philippine mosquitoes from
Francisco Baisas, consisting of 6,700 adults and 4,000 slides, has been
of immediate use to SEAMP’s research program on Southeast Asia mos-
quitoes and has been particularly valuable because of the number of
associated immature stages. Gerald I. Stage has donated 1,395 bees
from all over the world, a gratifying addition because a large number of
species have not been in the collection before. Mrs. Mary H. Ripley has
collected 884 insects in Bhutan, most of them moths very meticulously
prepared. Curtis W. Sabrosky, uspa, and Krombein have obtained a
small but useful lot of some 2,500 specimens in the Uzbek Soviet Social-
ist Republic. The Reverend Rufus H. LeFevre has contributed 794
beetles, bugs, and moths collected during his missionary service in China.
T. H. Davies has continued to favor the Department with New Zealand
insects, this time with a lot of 668 specimens, mostly Lepidoptera.

SEAMP has received 72 lots of mosquitoes, comprising 23,391 adults
and 16,134 slides.

From uspa the Department has received by transfer 73,550 speci-
mens. As always, this has been a particularly noteworthy addition be-
cause so many of the specimens represent species not previously in the
collection, or bear associated host data, or consist of reared series of im-
mature and adult stages. This particular transfer has included some
7,000 specimens, mostly Coleoptera, from H. P. Lanchester. Other
colleagues in uspA have made personal donations that include 2,928
specimens from W. W. Wirth, mostly Diptera from the northwestern
United States; 4,000 Microlepidoptera by Ronald W. Hodges from
Arizona, Florida, Michigan, and New York; and 888 water beetles
from Robert Gordon.

Several research associates have enriched the collections by continued
donation of material. F. S. Blanton has deposited 5,000 specimens of
Ceratopogonidae, K. C. Emerson has sent in more than 2,000 slides of
Mallophaga and Anoplura from his personal collection and from the
Department of the Army, and H. F. Loomis has added types and other
material of millipedes.

Lack of space precludes mention of numerous other individual and
institutional donors who have made generous contributions of speci-
mens; several, however, are so outstanding they merit special recognition.
David G. Hall has donated some 18,000 Sarcophagidae, the result of a
lifetime of systematic work on these economically important flesh flies,
and a technical library on them requiring twenty feet of shelf space; the
specimens include some 24 holotypes, more than 600 paratypes, and
represent nearly 1,500 species. Dorald A. Allred has sent nearly 35,000
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 107

insects in numerous orders taken during faunal and ecological surveys
of the Nevada test site study areas. William Rosenberg has donated
nearly 6,000 Scarabaeidae from all over the world, an indispensable
adjunct to Cartwright’s taxonomic studies in this family. Mr. and Mrs.
George Lacy have sent 3,800 specimens from British Honduras, mostly
Coleoptera. Vincent D. Roth has furthered Flint’s Arizona studies by
a gift of some 2,000 caddisflies. Joseph W. Adams has made special
efforts and has collected about 2,000 insects on flowers in Pennsylvania;
the insects and associated flower-visiting data will be most useful in the
pollination studies by Stage and other staff members.

When Department specialists are in the field, they do not limit their
collecting activities to just the group of insects in which they are particu-
larly interested but make a strong effort to obtain specimens in other
groups on which their colleagues have research projects. For example,
Flint as a specialist on one group of aquatic insects, the caddisflies,
makes every effort to collect other groups of aquatic insects, thus for-
warding Spangler’s research interests on water beetles. Spangler’s and
Flint’s collecting of nocturnal beetles and caddisflies at lights also yields
many specimens of moths for the lepidopterists. Spangler’s lot of 2,500
insects from Plummers Island is not very large, but it is significant
because it consists of specimens obtained by operation of a Malaise trap
for a ten-day period, the first time that this collecting technique has
been employed for more than a day at a time at that famous biological
preserve in the metropolitan Washington area. This Malaise trap ma-
terial has provided eleven new Plummers Island records among the
wasps to add to the 274 specics previously known from the area.

The departmental preparator’s unit—consisting of Ron Faycik, Marc
Roth, and Gary Hevel—has continued its devoted service in the process-
ing of back lots not accessioned in previous years and in handling in-
coming lots. They have accessioned thirty-three lots consisting of nearly
93,000 specimens and have sorted and distributed them to the appro-
priate divisions. In addition, they have mounted some 40,000 specimens
that have not yet been accessioned. The major part of their effort, how-
ever, during the year has been directed toward assistance in preparing
collections for the move from the Lamont Street building to the Natural
History Building. Roth and Faycik, working with Mrs. Vira Milbank,
the divisional preparator, have transferred all of the Lepidoptera from
about 500 nonstandard drawers into uSNM drawers and cases in prep-
aration for the move. After the collections were moved, they assisted in
getting cases installed in the proper systematic arrangement.

In the Division of Coleoptera, Gloria House, the divisional preparator
has processed nearly 78,000 specimens, sorting 30,000 to family, mount-
108 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

ing 5,500, labeling 34,500, and transferring 28,000 from temporary
storage containers to USNM drawers. Mrs. Janice White, a part-time
preparator, has processed 29,000 specimens, sorting 12,800 to order and
family, mounting 7,400, labeling 5,600, and transferring 15,000 to usnm
drawers. Miss Ludmila Kassianoff, divisional preparator in Hemiptera
and Hymenoptera, has made a great reduction in the large backlog of
unmounted, unlabeled specimens that have accumulated over the years.
In Lepidoptera and Diptera, Mrs. Milbank, in addition to her many
services preparing collections for the move, has incorporated the large
exchange shipment from the National Museum of Kenya, consisting of
8,900 specimens and 5,700 species, of which 2,600 have not been repre-
sented previously by named material. Crabill, assisted by Mrs. Sophie
Lutterlough, divisional preparator in Myriapoda and Arachnida, has
continued the restoration work on older collections, rehousing specimens
in fresh alcohol, remounting old slides, treating desiccated specimens
in vacuo with trisodium phosphate, and verifying unsuspected type-
specimens; Crabill also has continued his attempts to develop a hydro-
philic mounting medium for slide mounts more satisfactory than the
standard Hoyer’s formula. Mrs. Nancy Heath, divisional preparator in
Neuropteroids, working part time, has continued the program of re-
mounting and relabeling the Odonata collection, and also has mounted
many thousands of small or fragile specimens collected in Africa by
Krombein and Spangler.

Several miscellaneous projects have been completed or begun during
the year. Concurrently with the move of the Division of Coleoptera, the
extremely valuable Casey collection of Coleoptera has once more been
moved into a separate “Casey Room” along with associated reprint and
map files. Old manuscripts and associated historical materials from two
pioneer federal entomologists, C. V. Riley and Townsend Glover, have
been sent to the Smithsonian Archives for cataloging and safekeeping.

Negotiations have been instituted with several other institutions look-
ing toward the extended long-term loan deposit in the Smithsonian of
collections in which the Institution has current research efforts and
where the lending institution has no specialist and, reciprocally, similar
long-term loan deposits of Smithsonian materials in other institutions
having a specialist where the Institution has none. Such deposits will
be undertaken only under the most careful stipulations providing for
proper curatorial care of the loans, access to the collections by interested
and qualified third parties, and recall of the collections when the lending
institution obtains a specialist in that group or when the borrowing in-
stitution no longer has a specialist in the group.

INVERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

The Department has made considerable progress in several important
areas of activity. Most notable has been its continuing expansion of the
use of computer techniques for accomplishing curatorial tasks, thus
freeing valuable time for research and other functions. The year has
also seen a further broadening of the systematic investigations that its
members carried forward.

As partial results of his two-year visit to Hawaii, New Zealand, and
Australia in 1967-68, J. Laurens Barnard has completed and submitted
for publication two manuscripts on the shallow-water gammaridean
amphipods of Hawaii and New Zealand. In addition to his research
and field activities, Barnard has served as secretary for the Americas of
the Charles Darwin Foundation for the Galapagos Islands.

In October and November 1968 Thomas E. Bowman visited the Indian
Ocean Biological Centre at Ernakulam as a consultant on Crustacea
and began a project with H. E. Gruner to prepare a synopsis of the
families and genera of hyperiid amphipods.

A survey of the littoral and sublittoral marine and freshwater shrimps
of the Caribbean has been considerably advanced by Fenner A. Chace,
Jr.; a manuscript on a new genus and five new species of shrimps from
the western Atlantic has been completed as part of this study. The ex-
tensive report on the freshwater and terrestrial decapods of the West
Indies, by Chace and Horton H. Hobbs, Jr., also has been published
during the year. Studies on the crayfishes and their entocytherid ostracod
associates, particularly those from the southeastern United States, have
been continued by Hobbs, who has completed a major study on the dis-
tribution and phylogeny of the seventy-two species of Cambarus. His
Georgia field studies in April 1969 resulted in the collection of several
important species.

Investigations on parasitic copepods and their hosts have been carried
out by Roger F. Cressey, Jr., who also has served as editor for the Pro-
ceedings of the Biological Society of Washington. With Bruce R. Collette,
of the Ichthyological Laboratory, Bureau of Commercial Fisheries,
Cressey has completed a detailed study of the host-parasite relation-
ships between needlefishes and their parasitic copepods. He also has
completed a study with Ernest Lachner, Division of Fishes, on the rela-
tionship between parasitic copepods and echinoid fishes.

A computerized checklist of genera and higher taxa and a bibliography
of marine nematodes has been prepared by W. Duane Hope and re-
search associate D. G. Murphy, in collaboration with the Information
Systems Division in a form suitable for publication by photo-offset. In
addition, Hope has continued studies with the electron microscope on
116 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

the cuticle and somatic musculature of marine nematodes, studies that
are expected to help clarify phylogenetic relationships within the group.
During the year Hope has been appointed associate of the Graduate
Faculty of Rutgers University.

Studies on myodocopid Ostracoda based on collections from the Peru-
Chile Trench, the Antarctic Ocean, and the Philippine Islands have
been completed by Louis S. Kornicker. During the year Kornicker has
participated in a survey of the marine animals from the coastal shelf of
Cyprus, sponsored by the Smithsonian and the Hebrew University,
Israel. He served as chief scientist for part of the cruise.

The possibility of using differences in enzymal mobilities to elucidate
systematic interrelationships of the polychaetous annelids has led Mere-
dith L. Jones to study enzymes of worms from Florida and Woods Hole;
part of the summer of 1968 was spent at Woods Hole pursuing this study.
Jones also has presented a paper on boring of mollusk shells by the
sabellid worm Caobangia at the annual meeting of the American Asso-
ciation for the Advancement of Science. Study by Jones of collections
from Southeast Asia suggests that at least four species comprise Cao-
bangia, which previously was believed to be monotypic.

Systematics of Indo-West Pacific stomatopod crustaceans have been
continued by R. B. Manning, who has completed a review of Protosquilla
and allied genera in the family Gonodactylidae and also a review of
Harpiosquilla, family Squillidae. With the help of Mrs. Drina Byer, a
computer-generated catalog of the type specimens of stomatopods in
the National Collections has been prepared.

Relationships of American and Asiatic hydrobiid mollusks, based on
gross anatomy, have been investigated by J. P. E. Morrison; the hydro-
biids serve as the intermediate hosts of human Asiatic Schistosomiasis.
Morrison also has initiated a study of western Atlantic species of Donax.

David L. Pawson has completed a review of the holothuroid fauna of |
New Zealand and has continued work on the systematics of echinoids
and holothurians collected during the International Indian Ocean Expe-
dition and the United States Antarctic Research Program investigations.
In collaboration with G. Donnay, Carnegie Institution, the structure of
calcite crystals in echinoderms has been studied.

A monographic study on the scaled polychaetes of the superfamily
Aphroditoidea has been initiated by Marian H. Pettibone, who has com- |
pleted reviews of several genera, as well as members of the family
Eulepethidae. She also has described new, errant polychaetes from the |
Siboga Expedition, based on a draft manuscript prepared by the late |
H, Augener. |

Harald A. Rehder has continued his long-term investigation of the ©
zoogeography of the littoral mollusks of Polynesia, a vast area in the

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 117

tropical Pacific Ocean bounded by the Cook Islands, Palmyra Island,
and Easter Island. In June 1969 Rehder traveled to the central Pacific
to conduct field work necessary for the study.

A comparative study of the development of tropical sipunculid worms
of the genera Lithacrosiphon, Aspidosiphon, Phascolosoma, Sipunculus,
and Siphonosoma is being carried out by Mary E. Rice; field investiga-
tions have been conducted in Miami, Puerto Rico, and Curagao. A
study on the structure of possible boring organs in sipunculids was
presented at the annual meeting of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science in December 1968.

Representatives of several families of pelagic cephalopods have been
investigated by Clyde F. E. Roper; reports on representatives of the fam-
ilies Cycloteuthidae and Joubinoteuthidae from the North Atlantic have
been completed in collaboration with Richard Young. Roper has par-
ticipated in two cruises off Bermuda as part of the Ocean Acre project,
a long-term study (sponsored by the United States Navy) of the sys-
tematics and ecology or organisms occurring in a column of water under
a one-degree square of ocean surface. A cross-indexed bibliography of
cephalopod literature and a catalog of cephalopod names have also
been initiated during the year.

Joseph Rosewater has continued studies on the worldwide Periplo-
matidae and the Indo-Pacific Littorinidae and Cerithiidae, based on
materials studied in American, European, and Australian museums,
and during field work in the Indo-Pacific. The first portion of a mono-
graph on the Littorinidae should reach completion in 1969. He also has
served as president of both the Bibliological Society of Washington and
the American Malacological Union during the year.

Investigations on the systematics and physiological ecology of sponges
from the Caribbean and Mediterranean seas are among the studies
conducted by Klaus Ruetzler during the year; in this connection, he
has visited Barbados, Colombia, and several places in the Mediterranean
Sea as well. Current projects include a review of the genus Ircinia in
the Caribbean and investigations of symbiotic associations between algae
and sponges.

Research associates in residence and visiting research associates also
have made significant contributions to departmental research programs:
Roman Kenk has completed a review of the genus Planaria as part of
a long-term study of the freshwater triclad turbellarians of North
America; Isabel Canet [Pérez Farfante] has continued investigations on
American penaeid shrimps and has completed an important manu-
script that should simplify identification of juveniles of certain species
of Penaeus from the western Atlantic; Dennis M. Devaney has studied
the systematics and biology of chilophiurid ophiuroids and, as a partici-
118 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

pant in the “1969 Shark” expedition to British Honduras, he has initiated
a study of the larvae development of the brittlestar Ophiocoma pumila.

Departmental research activities also have been enhanced by the in-
vestigations of three graduate students in residence: Jackson E. Lewis
(Tulane University), studying calappid crabs under the guidance of
Fenner A. Chace, Jr., has completed a manuscript on reversal of sym-
metry in chelae of crabs of the genus Calappa; Nancy Cramer (George
Washington University) has completed her doctoral dissertation under
the supervision of Meredith L. Jones; and Catherine Kerby (George
Washington University) has conducted studies of the life history of a
polychaete under the guidance of Mary Rice and Meredith L. Jones.

The Collections

Among the more important activities for which the Department is
responsible are the care and development of the National Collections.
The extensive collections of invertebrates other than insects, now com-
prising in excess of twelve million specimens, are the focal point for
departmental research activities, as well as a major source of basic data
on invertebrates. All too often the collections and activities pertaining
to them are ranked below other kinds of endeavors, including research
and education in the broadest sense, in spite of the fact that the collec-
tions provide the basis for many staff research projects and are the main
reason for the large numbers of students and senior visitors who use the
facilities each year.

Emphasis on research as the primary activity of the professional staff,
broadening of the Institution’s educational activities, and severe restric-
tions on budget and personnel combined during the past year to increase
the work load of each curatorial unit in the Department. Government-
wide personnel ceilings have precluded filling several technical and
clerical positions and, in spite of efforts by. the curatorial staff, who have
assumed the burden of curatorial activities formerly carried out by the
professional staff, the backlog of materials awaiting processing and
identification has grown.

During the year a catalog of type specimens of echinoids in the Na-
tional Museum of Natural History and the Museum of Comparative
Zoology at Harvard, prepared by museum specialist Maureen Downey,
has been published. A similar catalog on ophiuroid type-specimens by
Miss Downey is in press, and catalogs of asteroid and holothurian types
are in preparation by Miss Downey and David Pawson, respectively.

Large collections of sponges and echinoderms from the Caribbean
and the Indian Ocean have been received from Paul R. Burkholder,
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 119

Lamont Geological Observatory ; 5,700 specimens of echinoids and holo-
thurians from the Indian Ocean and the Antarctic have been received
from the Smithsonian Oceanographic Sorting Center; and over 2,000
specimens of sponges, coelenterates, echinoderms, mollusks, and tunicates
have been received from the Mediterranean Marine Sorting Center. Dur-
ing the year the collections of recent bryozoans have been transferred
from the Division of Echinoderms to the Division of Invertebrate
Paleontology.

The collection of Mollusks has been enriched by the addition of 2,855
specimens of nudibranchs from the northeastern United States, Alaska,
and Thailand, from the estate of the late George M. Moore, University
of New Hampshire; this gift from the Moore estate also includes a series
of transparencies of living nudibranchs. More than 1,600 specimens of
mollusks from the Indo-Pacific region have been obtained on exchange
from the Museum of Comparative Zoology at Harvard University. Rolf
Brandt, sEato Median Research Laboratory, has donated 2,150 speci-
mens of land and freshwater mollusks from Thailand, greatly enhancing
the division holdings of mollusks from Southeast Asia.

Under a contract with the Department of Agriculture, museum spe-
cialist Walter J. Byas has continued identification of specimens of mol-
lusks intercepted at United States ports of entry. As a result of this
service, a useful reference collection of exotic mollusks potentially haz-
ardous to crops or as vectors of parasites and diseases is being accumu-
lated. A project has been initiated to prepare the cephalopod collection
for cataloging and entry of specimen-associated data into the computer
in a system similar to that being used for Crustacea.

In the Division of Worms, Frances Paulson and George Ford have
combined efforts to streamline the cataloging operation and have suc-
ceeded in making substantial progress in cataloging current material,
as well as identified lots in the backlog. Technician Vernetta Williams
has worked primarily on the slide collection, including preparation of
slide mounts of interstitial organisms and sorting of nematodes. The
addition of 25,000 nematodes to the collections each year from various
sources has added significantly to the Division work load.

The single largest addition to the collection of worms has been a
valuable series of oligochaetes from the estate of the late William R.
Murchie, comprising over 24,000 specimens and 3,000 slides of sections.
Other additions include approximately 7,000 specimens of annelids from
Florida, the West Indies, and Central and South America, collected by
David W. Kirtley, and 6,000 marine nematodes from the Antarctic, col-
lected by James Lowry, Virginia Institute of Marine Sciences.

During the past year there have been many notable additions to the
collection of Crustacea. Major additions have been to the crayfish col-
120 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

lections, through the efforts of Horton H. Hobbs, Jr., who has made
extensive collections in Kentucky, Tennessee, and Georgia, as well as
through the generosity of many colleagues from other institutions. In
addition, the crustacean holdings have been enhanced by the addition
of a large collection of freshwater ostracods from the estate of the late
Edward Ferguson, Lincoln University. Arthur G. Humes, Boston Uni-
versity, has deposited more than 2,900 commensal copepods from
Madagascar, most of them representing types.

Specialist H. B. Roberts, who has assumed the major portion of de-
capod identifications, has initiated an important exchange of types with
the Museum National d’ Histoire Naturelle, Paris, through Mme Danielle
Guinot-Grmek. He also has begun a reorganization of the crustacean
reprint collection. Specialist C. Allan Child, whose primary responsibility
is the cataloging operation in Crustacea, has assembled data for a cata-
log of types of the Pycnogonida. Specialist Roland Brown has assumed
the role of departmental coordinator for purchasing, for development
and maintenance of curatorial supplies and equipment, and for meeting
visitors’ equipment needs.

VERTEBRATE ZOOLOGY

Research in the Department of Vertebrate Zoology represents a com-
bination of museum-based systematic revisionary and monographic
studies and field-oriented ecological, behavioral, and life history studies.
Because correct identification of animals and knowledge of their re-
lationships is fundamental to further studies, such identification aides
as handbooks and manuals are part of the Department's scientific effort.

Systematic revisions and monographs have been prepared in three
of the divisions, with the greatest emphasis on fishes, of which perhaps
only one half of the world’s species are known. Victor G. Springer has
completed research for a revision of the blenniid fish genus Ecsenius and,
with W. F. Smith-Vaniz, a graduate student at the University of Miami,
a synopsis of the blenniid tribe Salariini.

W. Ralph Taylor has continued his long-term studies of the marine
family Ariidae and a study of hybrids of the freshwater family
Ictaluridae.

Stanley H. Weitzman has nearly completed a comprehensive study on
the evolutionary relationships of the stomiatoid fish families Gonosto-
matidae, Maurolicidae, and Sternoplychidae. In addition, he has under-
taken further studies on the anatomy and relationships of the fish
suborder Characoidei. Han Nijssen of the Zoological Museum of the
University of Amsterdam is collaborating with him in a study of the cat-
fish genus Corydoras. Visiting research associate Ambat G. K. Menon
of the Zoological Survey of India returned to Calcutta in July 1968 after
completing a worldwide revision of the flatfish genus Cynoglossus.

Robert H. Gibbs, Jr., has continued studies of bathypelagic stomiatoid
fishes, completing a worldwide systematic and zoogeographic study of the
genus Stomias and preliminary systematic work on the genus Batho-
philus. He has also nearly completed work on the family Astronesthidae.
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 127

He has supervised the predoctoral research of Richard H. Goodyear, a
graduate student at George Washington University, on studies of the
family Malacosteidae. Gibbs’ work on flying fishes has resulted in the
preparation of a manuscript on the genus C'ypselurus from the eastern
tropical Atlantic, and he is working on flying fishes for the multi-volume
Fishes of the Western North Atlantic. The Smithsonian has been desig-
nated by the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization
(FAO) as world center for deposition of tuna-like fishes. Gibbs serves
as chairman of the FAo working group on tuna taxonomy, of which
Research Associate Bruce Collette is a member. Their definitive paper
on the “Comparative Anatomy and Systematics of the Tunas, Genus
Thunnus” has been recognized with an award as an outstanding scien-
tific contribution by both the Smithsonian and the Bureau of
Commercial Fisheries.

Richard L. Zusi has completed work with Joseph R. Jehl, Jr., of the
San Diego Natural History Society, on the relationships of three species
of the little-known shorebirds in the monotypic genera, Phegornis,
Aechmorhynchus, and Prosobonia, utilizing new evidence from anatomy
and downy young. S. Dillon Ripley, assisted by Gorman M. Bond, has
begun intensive work on a monograph of the rails of the world. J.
Fenwick Lansdowne has completed ten of a series of forty plates to
illustrate the monograph. Research associate Richard C. Banks is con-
tinuing his systematic studies of the tinamous. Charles J. La Rue has
continued his systematic study of skull morphology in the Ciconiiformes
for his PhD dissertation at the University of Maryland under Zusi’s
direction.

Charles O. Handley, Jr., has worked on revisions of bat genera. He
has completed the free-tailed bats, Molossops, and is continuing re-
visions of the long-tongued bats, Leptonycteryis, and, with Kay Ferris,
the white-lined bats, Vampyrops. Duane A. Schlitter has continued
work on his doctoral dissertation at the University of Maryland on a
revision of the rodent subgenus Gerbillus under Henry W. Setzer. John
R. Napier and his wife have almost completed research on color varia-
tion in coat color of the squirrel monkeys. During visits to museums in
the United States and Europe this year, he has accumulated data for a
long-term research project on limb proportions of primates.

Systematic studies of vertebrates often entail gathering information
on ecology and behavior in the field that may be used in conjunction
with morphological and anatomical characters studied in the laboratory.
In addition to observations and photographic or sound recordings, other
highly sophisticated technical equipment or instruments have been used
in some studies in the department.
128 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

Gibbs has collaborated with Clyde Roper of the Department of In-
vertebrate Zoology and other biologists and oceanographers at the Uni-
versity of Rhode Island, Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, and the United
States Navy in “Ocean Acre,” an intensive study of life histories, vertical
distribution, and migration of midwater fishes and other organisms in a
single small area southwest of Bermuda. He has participated in two
cruises supported by a grant from the Office of Naval Research. Speci-
mens from the cruises are being sorted and identified prior to intensive
systematic study.

Ernest A. Lachner has spent most of the year on sabbatical leave study-
ing the breeding behavior of chubs of the genus Nocomis in several
streams in the eastern and midwestern United States. He has demon-
strated that numerous intergeneric hybrids involving Nocomis as one
parent are the result of the chubs’ tolerance of other fishes, such as dace,
at their nests. Because both species utilize the same rock pile for spawn-
ing, chance cross-fertilizattion may take place. Based on his field work,
he has nearly completed several parts of a major monograph on the
ecology, behavior, distribution, and systematics of chubs. With Roger
Cressey of the Department of Invertebrate Zoology, he has completed a
paper on the relation between diskfishes or sharksuckers of the family
Echeneiidae and their parasitic copepods, which also serve as their food.

George R. Zug joined the department in January 1969 as assistant
curator in the Division of Reptiles and Amphibians. He has revised for
publication his dissertation on locomotion and morphology of the pelvic
girdle and hind limbs of cryptodiran turtles and is currently analyzing
color patterns in snakes in relation to their ecology.

Zusi has finished a paper on the feeding niche and adaptations of the
Trembler (Mimidae) of the Lesser Antilles, based on his field work in
Dominica. He has pointed out that the species represents an ecological
counterpart of some ovenbirds and woodhewers of the mainland. Paul
Slud has terminated research in the Museum on methods by which to
conduct avifaunal surveys in the field. Next year he intends to apply this
study to field work in comparing representative avifaunas in Brazil and
Costa Rica and to relate them numerically to their respective
environments.

Jan Reese, a student at Chesapeake College, has completed a manu-
script on his six-year population study of Ospreys in Talbot County,
Maryland, in consultation with George E. Watson. This Maryland popu-
lation is reproducing at a rate well above that of other known popula-
tions in the United States, most of which currently have little success in
breeding.

Research Associate Crawford Greenewalt’s book, Birdsong: Acoustics
and Physiology, has been published by the Smithsonian Institution Press.
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 129

After spawning, a male Bluehead Chub, Nocomts leptocephalus, carries stones in
is mouth to his gravel nest in a tributary of the James River in western Vir-
zinia. Most of the other smaller fishes over this nest represent a spawning school
of Mountain Redbelly Dace, Chrosomus oreas. Ernest Lachner’s field observa-
tions have shown that such compatible associations of breeding populations of
chubs and other cyprinid fishes is a primary factor for the high incidence of
natural intergeneric hybrids.

His laboratory analysis of recorded bird voices has provided new insight
into sound production by birds. He has demonstrated conclusively that a
single song may be produced by sounds from two vocal sources in the
bird.

For many years Charles Handley has been studying the flora and fauna
of Assateague Island off the Eastern Shore of Maryland and Virginia.

j

Assisted by his wife, he is attempting to define the biotic communities

and assess the impact of a growing tide of human visitors on the biotic
| communities and their components. Handley also has studied population
| dynamics and ecology of forest bats at Belém, Brazil. By marking more
jthan 1,500 individual bats, he has accumulated much information on

130 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

vertical and horizontal distribution and habitat selection. With a re-
capture rate of about ten percent, he has been able to demonstra
nocturnal movements of considerable distance.

Using night-vision equipment on loan to the Smithsonian from the
Department of Defense, research associate Arthur M. Greenhall h
been studying the feeding behavior of vampire bats in Mexico. Thi
FAO-sponsored research may have considerable economic importance
throughout Latin America, where vampires feed on the blood of cattle
and may transmit rabies to human beings.

James A. Peters has continued development of time-share compute
for research use, including a program for biogeographical analysis. H
gave a short course in use of the telephone-terminal computer in Jun
1969 to various other vertebrate zoologists interested in inter-museum
data communication. With Richard Van Gelder of the American
Museum of Natural History, he has established the first link in an inter-
museum computer network. Through their joint effort, the first national
meeting of the Museums and Universities Data, Program, and Informa-
tion Exchange (MUDPIE) group was held in New York.

Major interdisciplinary programs involving ecological studies of
mammals and birds and their role in the dispersal of viruses and other
diseases through ectoparasites are under way in northern South America,
Africa, the Pacific Ocean, and southeast Asia. The programs involve
local field collaborators as well as laboratory-based entomologists and
virologists in several countries.

Charles Handley’s research team has concluded three years of field
work on the distribution and ecology of mammals in Venezuela. Sys-
tematic studies of the vertebrates have begun, and visiting research as-
sociate Ralph Wetzel of the University of Connecticut has developed a
statistical technique for the recognition of taxa. Several hundred thou-
sand ectoparasites collected in the field have been distributed to special-
ists in the United States, Latin America, Japan, and Taiwan.

Three field teams of mammalogists have worked in Ghana, the Ivory
Coast, Upper Volta, and South Africa under the direction of Henry
Setzer. More than 60,000 mammal specimens have been collected under
this African project in the last three years. Approximately twenty-five
papers on preliminary studies of ectoparasites and virology have been
published. In the future, all data on specimens will be automated in
order that host identification lists may be sent out to parasitologists as
soon as the mammal specimens are cataloged.

The Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program, directed by research
associate Philip S. Humphrey, has continued surveying bird populations
and movements in the Pacific Ocean. Intensive studies at selected islands
have been accompanied by shipboard studies in the central Pacific and

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 131

off the west coast of North America. A survey of the birds at Eniwetok
and other atolls in the Marshall and Gilbert islands has resulted in
A. Binion Amerson’s comprehensive report on “The Ornithology of the
Marshall and Gilbert Islands.” Long-term studies of bird populations
have continued on Sand Island in Johnston Atoll and on Kure Atoll and
French Frigate Shoals in the Hawaiian Leewards, with major emphasis
on breeding biology and population dynamics through banding. More
than 33,000 birds have been banded this year. Two long-distance re-
coveries involved an Elegant Tern banded in San Diego and recovered
on Sand Island and a Common Tern banded on Long Island, New York,
and recovered in the Bay of Panama. Since February 1969 emphasis on
field work has been greatly reduced and the major effort is now directed
toward preparation of comprehensive island and species reports.

Site-oriented ecological studies have been under way at the Area de
Pesquisas Ecologicas do Guama (APEG) in Belém, Brazil since 1963 in
collaboration with the Brazilian Instituto de Pesquisas e Experimentagao
Agropecuarias do Norte, the Belém Virus Laboratory, and Yale Univer-
sity. Humphrey has served as principal investigator on two of the proj-
ects and is a member of the commission for coordination of research ac-
tivities in APEG. Data from the study area have been computerized in a
system of ten-meter grids, and information on vegetation, soil, clima-
tology, and the fauna, based on the same grid, is being collected. Thomas
E. Lovejoy, a graduate student at Yale University, is studying the
ecology and epidemiology of birds captured in mist nets set at varying
heights in the Belém forest.

Bird banding and collection of ectoparasites and blood samples have
continued in the Middle East by two field parties of the Palearctic
Migratory Bird Survey under the direction of George Watson. Approxi-
mately 20,000 birds have been banded and more than a thousand blood
samples have been returned to Yale University for virus testing. Anti-
body formation in response to a new virus has been demonstrated.

Another bird migration study is underway in India in collaboration
with the Bombay Natural History Society under Salim Ali and the Mi-
gratory Animal Pathological Survey under Elliott McClure. Recoveries
in the Soviet Union of waterfowl banded at Bharatpur in Rajajastan
have demonstrated several migration routes over the Himalayas. The
Poona Virus Laboratory took blood samples and ectoparasites from 500
birds trapped at Bharatpur in the spring of 1969 to survey the potential
for virus transmission by the migrants.

Because of the department’s concern for conservation and interest in
studies of migratory birds in the Far East and the Pacific basin, Watson
and research associate John W. Aldrich have participated in a meeting
of ornithologists in Tokyo to explore the possibility of a migratory bird

treaty with Japan similar to those that the United States already has in
effect with Canada and Mexico. Another meeting will take place in
Washington, D.C.

Handbooks and identification manuals can stimulate interest in a
group of animals or a geographic region and identify problems for in-
tensified study. Thus, the production of such compilations is often a
foundation for future research. Several projects of this type have been
completed or have seen substantial work in the Department this year.

George Watson, assisted by J. Phillip Angle and Peter C. Harper, has
completed the species-account section for a research handbook on Ant-
arctic birds. These researchers have worked concurrently on a set of
distribution maps of Antarctic birds for the Antarctic Folio Series,
assisted by visiting research associate Roberto Schlatter, a graduate
student from Chile at the Johns Hopkins University. Watson has been
assisted by Betty Jean Gray, a student at Mt. Holyoke College, in work
on the warblers, Sylviinae, for Peters’ Check-list of the Birds of the |
World.

Volumes one and two of the Handbook of the Birds of India and
Pakistan, by S. Dillon Ripley and Salim Ali, have been published and |
at least two more are in press.

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 133

Twenty-seven sections of the Smithsonian Preliminary Identification
Manual to African Mammals have been completed under the editorship
of research associate J. A. J. Meester of Pretoria, South Africa. Two
other Smithsonian identification manuals, on the mammals and the
reptiles of Vietnam, which were written by United States Navy medical
personnel stationed at the Museum, will be published by the Smithsonian
Institution Press in the near future. James Peters and his collaborators,
Roberto Donoso-Barros of Chile and Braulio Orejas-Miranda of Uru-
guay, have finished the Catalogue of Neotropical Squamata, which will
be submitted to the Smithsonian Institution Press for publication.

The Primate Biology Program is concerned both with research and
education. A significant proportion of director John R. Napier’s time
this past year has been spent on the educational aspects of the program.
During the fall he gave lecture and demonstration courses in primate
biology at the following institutions in London: The London School of
Economics, the Institute of Archeology, and the Royal Free Hospital of
Medicine. In December 1968 the London office, the Unit of Primate
Biology (Smithsonian Institution) , moved to its new quarters at Queen
Elizabeth College at the University of London. After Napier returned
to Washington during the winter, he presented a weekly lecture series
on “Roots of Mankind” to the Friends of the National Zoo. These
lectures will be published as a book by the Smithsonian Institution Press.

The Collections

Work by Olga Rybak and Shirley Artis on entering specimen data on
seabirds has progressed through the HEW contract in the Division of
Birds under the supervision of George E. Watson and David Bridge.
Information on all National Museum specimens of the orders Sphenis-
ciformes, Procellariformes, and Pelecaniformes. has been recorded,
punched, and entered into the computer. The marine species of Charad-
riiformes remain to be entered. All new specimens collected by the
Palearctic Migratory Bird Survey and the orders Tinamiformes, Gavii-
formes, and Podicipediformes also have been entered. To provide infor-
mation of future use in computerization of bird specimens, Richard C.
Banks is making a survey of collections in the United States for the
American Ornithologists’ Union.

The Division of Mammais will utilize the bird data format and, for
the time being, the same computer program for entering mammal col-
lection records. A numericlature of mammals of the world has been pre-
pared by various specialists under the supervision of Henry W. Setzer,
and data entry should begin in the summer of 1969.
134 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

Large segments of the National Collection of mammals have been
moved this year—some of them twice. Marine mammals and ungulates

first were moved to the Smithsonian storage facility at Silver Hill, Mary-
land, and then transferred to better quarters in Alexandria, Virginia,
where hopefully a Marine Mammal Study Center will be established
next year. Computerization of data on these specimens stored “off
campus” will facilitate their use until the new Center can be adequately
staffed. The primate and carnivore collections have been moved to new
locations in the Natural History Building to clear space for the return of
the Department of Entomology from Lamont Street. The ungulate
skeletons and the alcoholic collection have been reorganized. The divi-
sional administrative record-keeping system—especially that dealing
with accessions, loans, and other specimen transactions—has been
streamlined.

Accessions of note in the Division of Mammals are: 11,150 specimens
received through the Venezuelan Project; 14,500 mammals from west-
ern and southern Africa received through the African Mammal Project;
50 porpoises from the west and south coasts of South Africa from K. S.
Norris, Oceanic Institute, Honolulu; 75 porpoises of the genus Stenella
from W. F. Perrin, Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, La Jolla, Cali-
fornia; 1,656 mammals from Brazil through the Belém Virus Labora-
tory, Rockefeller Foundation; 6,000 bats from Colombia from C. J.
Marinkelle, Universidad de Los Andes, Bogota; over 200 East African
monkeys from Cynthia Booth, Tigoni Primate Research Center, Limuru,
Kenya; several hundred fluid-preserved specimens from the anatomical
research collection of W. C. Osman Hill, Yerkes Regional Primate
Center, Atlanta, Georgia; and a type of the bat Antrogous pallidus
obscurus from R. H. Baker, Michigan State University, East Lansing.

Among the accessions to the National Collection of birds are repre-
sentatives of two newly described species: a peculiar swallow Pseudo-
chelidon sirintarae, from Thailand, whose only close relative is an
African species, donated by Frank G. Nicholls and Kitti Thonglongya;
and an antpitta, Grallaria eludens, from Peru received on exchange
from George Lowery. Also received are eggs of the Gray Gull, Larus
modestus, from Chile donated by George M. Moffett, Jr., and casts of
California Condor bones from Stanton Cave, Arizona, given by Paul
Parmalee.

Large collections of bird skins have been received from the eastern
Mediterranean through the Palearctic Migratory Bird Survey; from
North America through the Fish and Wildlife Service, including collec-
tions donated by Bert Roberts and Elizabeth P. Bartsch; and from the
Pacific Ocean through the Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program.
Important additions to the skeleton and spirit collections, besides speci-
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 135

mens obtained by the Palearctic Migratory Bird Survey, include birds
from Antarctica, collected by George E. Watson and J. P. Angle, and
from Churchill, Manitoba, collected by Richard L. Zusi.

The Division of Reptiles and Amphibians has received two collections
from Thailand totaling 492 specimens, donated by Sergeant Kenneth
T. Nemuras, usar, and Major John E. Scanlon, usa. The Smithsonian
Oceanographic Sorting Center has transferred 130 specimens from the
Indian Ocean to the Division. A sizable collection of South American
reptiles has been given by Roberto Donoso-Barros. A collection of 32
Haideotriton wallacei, a rare subterranean salamander, and 26 paratypes
of the salamander Typhlotriton braggi have been given by David Lee
and Jeffrey Black, respectively. The North Carolina State Museum has
transferred five types of emydine turtles. Specimens cataloged this year
total 1,962.

Important accessions in the Division of Fishes have been a 512-foot
specimen of a coelacanth, Latimeria chalumnae, donated by H. N.
Schnitzlein, Department of Anatomy, University of Alabama Medical
Center; more than 10,000 fishes from the Tropical Atlantic Biological
Laboratory, United States Department of the Interior, Fish and Wild-
life Service, Miami, Florida, through Fred Berry; marine fishes from
Kenya received through Wolfgang Klausewitz, Senckenberg Museum,
Germany; and freshwater fishes from western Africa through Tyson
Roberts, Stanford University.

MINERAL SCIENCES

Research emphasis within the Department has undergone reevalua-
tion during the year, and significant redirection of parts of our program
has been accomplished. The expanded interests and activities of the Di-
vision of Petrology have been recognized by the addition of “and Vol-
canology” to its title. Staff members have investigated five important
eruptions during the year, and the program in submarine geology has
been expanded. Research on meteorites and tektites has continued at a
high level, stimulated in part by contracts from the National Aeronautics
and Space Administration for preparation for the examination of lunar
samples. The fall of the Allende, Mexico, meteorite in February 1969—
a meteorite of rare type recovered in large amount—was promptly in-
vestigated in the field and laboratory by staff members. Additional
research centering around the study of the Foote Lithium Mine in North
Carolina has been undertaken and important new observations are being
made. Some progress has been made in the area of electronic data stor-
age and retrieval.

Investigation of the complex mineral suite that occurs at the Foote
Mineral Company spodumene mine, Kings Mountain, North Carolina,
has been continued during the year by John S. White, Jr., in collabora-

tion with Peter B. Leavens of the University of Delaware and Richard
W. Thomssen, visiting research associate, Smithsonian Research Founda-
tion. A continually growing number (now about ten) of new mineral
species are being described for publication as separate papers. A mono-
graph that will contain descriptions of some eighty to ninety minerals
found at the mine, and giving their paragenesis, is under preparation.
A description of one of these, switzerite, a new manganese, iron phos-
phate, has already been published. The description of a new tin silicate
is nearly completed and an abstract of the paper has been submitted to
the International Mineralogical Association New Mineral Names Com-
mission for prepublication approval. Work on the rare mineral lithio-
phosphate has also been completed by White. Included among the new
species under study are two other tin minerals and several manganese,
iron phosphates. An April 1969 collecting trip to the Foote mine has
resulted in the addition of many specimens to the collections that will
be of value in the continuing studies.

R. W. Thomssen has undertaken research in connection with a pre-
doctoral internship on a project concerning the systematic variations in
the compositions of femic minerals in some porphyry copper deposits.
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 141

Primary and secondary biotite micas from different porphyry copper
deposits have been examined with the electron microprobe. Significant
variations of Fe, Mg, and Ti have been found in step-scan analytical
traverses across the biotite flakes. Preliminary considerations of the
compositional data indicate that, as time passes, the solutions from
which the biotite crystals are precipitating are enriched in Fe and Ti
with respect to Mg. Near the end of crystallization of biotites a pro-
nounced reversal in the relative amounts of these elements took place.
Research is continuing in an effort to evaluate this phenomena and to
relate the biotite composition variations to the whole rock and minerali-
zation histories.

George Switzer has continued his studies of eclogite and other ultra-
mafic nodules from South African kimberlite pipes. He has completed
studies of the glass phase observed in kyanite eclogites from the Roberts
Victor mine, and these studies are being extended to include a similar
glass phase observed in other eclogite specimens from the same locality.
As part of this study, a large number of electron microprobe analyses
are being made of the major constituents of these nodules: garnet,
omphacite, olivine, diopside, enstatite, and chrome diopside. This
analytical data is being supplemented when necessary by partial wet
chemical analyses by Eugene Jarosewich.

Also under investigation by Switzer are specimens of andradite garnet
on serpentinite matrix dredged from the mid-Atlantic Ridge by Wil-
liam G. Melson, the first observed occurrence of this mineral assemblage
from this area.

Chemical and metallographic studies by Roy S. Clarke, Jr., continue
on the Campo del Cielo, Argentina, meteorites and related meteorites in
the hexahedrite-octahedrite composition range. Particular emphasis is
being placed on the role of phosphorus in the development of these
temperature-dependent structures and the interrelationships between
the minerals schreibersite and cohenite. A better understanding of the
low-temperature cooling history of iron meteorites should result. Studies
on several pallasite meteorites and the new Allende, Mexico, meteorite
are also in progress. The oxidation state in synthetic glass systems of
tektite composition is being studied too in the expectation of obtaining
information on metallic spherules in tektites.

Kurt Fredriksson has spent five months at the Manned Spacecraft
Center, nasa, Houston, Texas, assisting in preparation for the antici-
pated lunar samples. He also worked with the staff from the Geology
Branch at Houston on southwest Texas ashflow rocks and on glass
particles resembling micro-tektites from recent volcanic ashes from
Hawaii and Surtsey.
142 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

Cerro Negro Volcano, Nicaragua, in eruption November 1968. Lavas and ash
from this eruption are under study by W. G. Melson, who was at the volcano
in November.

New instrumentation and techniques for nondispersive x-ray analysis
have been studied by Fredriksson and a system has been adapted to the
electron probe. The technique allows very rapid phase identification or
qualitative or semi-quantitative analysis of small multicomponent sys-
tems. Of special interest seems to be the possibility to analyze small
compositional differences (0.2 weight percent) in various minerals,
e.g., proton bombardment-induced oxygen deficiency in mineral phases
from the surface of the moon.

Fredriksson also visited India in January 1969 in order to coordinate
an extensive investigation of the Lonar Lake, a crater-like depression in
central India, suspected to be an astrobleme. En route to India he
studied the Mt. Mayon and Taal volcanoes in the Philippines and also
visited the Merapi Volcano in central Java immediately after its Janu-
ary eruption. These studies have been carried out in cooperation with
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 143

the Smithsonian Center for Short-Lived Phenomena and the results
have been communicated to interested scientists through the Center.

Fredriksson’s work on detailed phase composition in meteorites has
continued and a system for automatic data processing for all kinds of
meteorite research data has been worked out. Once implemented, this
system will not only facilitate “bookkeeping” in regard to the collection
but also will provide a powerful research tool.

Robert F. Fudali has continued experimental work bearing on crys-
tallization sequences of natural basalts and andesites and chemical
trends of the residual liquids. He also has continued study of the rela-
tions between divalent iron, trivalent iron, oxygen fugacity, and total
chemical composition of a given rock. This work involves subjecting
powdered samples of different rocks to extreme temperatures (800-
1300° C.) and very low oxygen partial pressures (10-° to 10-*° atmos-
pheres) to observe how variations in these two parameters change the
character of the resulting mineral assemblage.

Fudali has spent three weeks in Mauritania, primarily examining two
large circular features—Richat and Semsiyat domes. In the past these
have been suspected of being the root structures of ancient meteorite
craters. Extensive petrographic work has been performed on the re-
turned rocks in an effort to determine the nature of these domes. Based
on the complete lack of any effect in the rocks that can be attributed
to the shock waves that are generated by a meteorite impact, it has been
concluded that these features are not meteoritic in origin but must in-
stead result from unusual endogenic processes.

Curator emeritus Edward P. Henderson has conducted detailed
studies of four iron meteorites of the rare ataxite group. In cooperation
with Ananda Dube of the Geological Survey of India, he has studied
the meteorite that fell at Muzaffarpur, India, on 11 April 1964. The
other meteorites, Del Rio, Nordheim, and Monahans, are all from Texas
and have been studied in cooperation with Virgil Barnes of the Univer-
sity of Texas and Elbert King of the Manned Spacecraft Center, NASA,
Houston, Texas.

Eugene Jarosewich and Joseph Nelen have provided a number of
high-quality quantitative chemical and electron-microprobe analyses
essential to the research programs not only of the Division of Meteorites
but also of the Department of Mineral Sciences as a whole. Jarosewich
has performed complete analyses of seven stony meteorites and several
inclusions from meteorites (in cooperation with Anana Dube of the
Geological Survey of India), two stony meteorites (in cooperation with
K. Keil of the University of New Mexico), and one silicate inclusion
sample from the Weekaroo Station iron meteorite (in cooperation with
Edward Olsen of the Field Museum of Natural History, Chicago).
144 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

Extensive work on the Allende, Mexico, meteorite has been completed
in cooperation with the staff of the Division of Meteorites. Four rocks
from the Arenal Volcano, Philippine Islands, have been analyzed, as
well as several minerals, and a number of partial analyses on various
materials. Nelen has done extensive electron microprobe work on several
meteorites in cooperation with Kurt Fredriksson; F. Kraut of the
Museum d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris, and G. Kurat of the Naturhist-
otisches Museum, Vienna, Austria. Detailed microprobe work has
been performed on the Allende, Mexico, meteorite in cooperation with
the staff of the Division of Meteorites. Joseph Nelen also has studied
ignimbritic rocks, the distribution of carbon in meteorites, and has done
developmental work on an automatic data-processing procedure for the
meteorite collection. Much of Nelen’s effort also has gone into coopera-
tive work with Fredriksson and the Manned Spacecraft Center, NASA,
Houston, Texas, in preparatory work for the study of the returned
lunar samples.

Brian Mason has continued to work on the phase composition of
stony meteorites and has complemented this work with a study of ultra-
basic xenoliths from an extinct volcanic pipe near Kakanui, New Zea-
land. These xenoliths probably crystallized within the earth’s mantle,
the material of which may resemble meteorite compositions. Similarities
and differences between analogous compositions of terrestrial and
extraterrestrial derivation are significant for the elucidation of tempera-

tures and pressures of crystallization. In collaboration with E. P. Hen-
derson, Mason has investigated the Australian tekites collected during
their expeditions in 1963-1965 and 1967. He reported on this work to
the Third International Tektite Symposium in New York in April 1969.

Vagn F. Buchwald, on leave from the Department of Metallurgy,
Technical University of Denmark, has been a research associate in
the Division of Meteorites for this past year and will be with the Divi-
sion for another year. He is working with the Smithsonian collection
of iron meteorites in order to compile a modern handbook of the
metallography and chemistry of iron meteorites. Photomicrographs,
critical historical data, and a list of references will be included. This
work will be a major contribution to the study of these meteorites and
will greatly increase the information on the collection available in pub-
lished form to scientific colleagues.

Research in the Division of Petrology and Volcanology has focused
on studies of rocks from the deep sea floor and their implications on
sea-floor spreading and continental drift. Considerable study also has
been directed toward certain recent volcanic eruptions. The latter

and Volcanology.

research has continued to receive much assistance from the Smithsonian
Center for Short-Lived Phenomena.

The Division has planned and carried out a geophysical investigation
of the remarkable Juan de Fuca Ridge, a highly active zone of sea-floor
spreading that is but several hundred miles west of Oregon and Wash-
ington. The study has been conducted on one of the finest oceano-
graphic vessels in the United States, the United States Coast and
Geodetic Survey ship Oceanographer. This ship, equipped with some
of the most modern geophysical gear, including a narrow-beam echo
sounder, and staffed with excellent officers and men, has led to a num-
ber of important discoveries: (1) recognition of new evidence for the
hypothesis of sea-floor spreading and continental drift, (2) the nature
and probable delineation of the seaward extension of the San Andreas
fault, and (3) collection of a wide variety of volcanic rocks, some of
which reflect the very young age of the median part of the Juan de Fuca
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 147

Ridge. The dredging has been unusually successful. Thirteen of fifteen
dredges have yielded rock samples. This extensive collection is a valuable
source of materials for detailed petrographic and geochemical informa-
tion of the makeup of oceanic crust and thus is one of the division’s
major accessions. This study, carried out in conjunction with Jason
Morgan and John Duncan of Princeton University, has included
William G. Melson and Harold Banks of the Division’s staff and
Thomas Simkin of the Smithsonian Oceanographic Sorting Center and
a research associate in the Division of Petrology and Volcanology.
Interagency cooperation has been a key part of the success of this study,
with the Environmental Science Services Administration providing
both technical advice and ship support.

Melson has continued his studies of rocks from the mid-Atlantic
Ridge, which are cooperative studies with the Woods Hole Oceano-
graphic Institution and Oregon State University.

One of the outstanding achievements of the year has been the
National Science Foundation-funded deep-sea drilling program, a joint
effort of a number of oceanographic institutions. Numerous holes have
been drilled to relatively shallow depths in the Atlantic Ocean and
Caribbean and core recovery has been remarkably successful. Although

148 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

intended for recovery primarily of sedimentary materials, the drill has
penetrated a short distance into underlying basaltic lavas at a number
of stations. These lava samples, whose preliminary study is being per-
formed under the advisory panel on petrology on which Melson serves,
provide important information on the older lavas of the midocean
ridge system. The results of the sedimentary drilling support the theory
of sea-floor spreading and provide unusually complete stratigraphic
sections for paleontologic and other studies.

Two eruptions have been the focus of much field and laboratory
investigation. The devastating explosive eruption of Arenal Volcano,
Costa Rica, in 1968 and 1969 has been investigated by Melson and
Simkin. The 1968 eruption and collapse of the caldera of the great
shield volcano of Isla Fernandina, Galapagos, has been studied by
Simkin.

Arenal Volcano emitted a series of both laterally and vertically
directed explosions that devastated about eight square miles and killed
some eighty people in less than three days. Subsequent investigations
have shown that the eruption can be classified as nueés ardentes of the
explosion type and that Arenal Volcano, deemed to be extinct prior to
the eruption, had erupted last around a.p. 1500. Arenal and presum-
ably many other assumed extinct explosive volcanoes have very long
periods of repose between eruptions, periods that may range upward
from 500 years.

There have been two expeditions to Arenal—in July and August of
1968 under Smithsonian sponsorship, and in March 1969 under cospon-
sorship of the National Georgraphic Society. The field data and samples
are still under study, but preliminary results were preprinted and dis-
tributed by the Smithsonian Center for Short-Lived Phenomena shortly
after the first expedition. Howard Waldron of the United States
Geological Survey participated in the first expedition and acted as team
leader of the three scientists (Waldron, Melson, and Simkin) dis-
patched by the United States at the request of the President of Costa
Rica. The scientific aspects of the two expeditions will soon be described
in a Manuscript in preparation by Melson.

Dating of the prehistoric eruptions has been a key part in the study
of Arenal Volcano. Clifford Evans and George Metcalf of the Depart-
ment of Anthropology have provided dates on artifacts buried by prior
eruptions and the Smithsonian Institution Radiocarbon Laboratory has —
provided dates on trees buried by a prehistoric eruption.

In early June 1968 remote sensing devices throughout the hemisphere |
indicated unusually explosive volcanic activity in the Galapagos Islands.
A small expedition was organized by the Smithsonian, including biolo-
gists R. I. Bowman and P. A. Colinvaux, and geologists Keith A. How-
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 149

ard of the United States Geological Survey and Tom Simkin, a research
associate in the Division of Petrology and Volcanology. With the ex-
cellent help of the United States Air Force, the group reached the island
of Fernandina three weeks after the start of activity. They found that
the central caldera, an area approximately two miles in diameter near
the summit of Volcano Fernandina, had subsided roughly 100 feet upon
the withdrawal of lava from a large chamber within the volcano. Such
subsidence is not uncommon in the geologic record, but this event is
the largest known since the Katmai (Alaska) activity of 1912. Rock
avalanches down the oversteepened sides prevented descent to the floor
of the caldera, but observations from the rim showed that the floor was
little disturbed and fracturing was restricted to within one-fourth mile
of the elliptical boundary fault. The volume of volcanic ash was small
and no lava was extruded within the caldera although lava flows on the
outer flanks preceded the collapse. Laboratory work is continuing on
materials collected during field work in the summer 1968 and follow-up
studies of the collapse are planned.

In addition to the major programs of research, a small amount of
laboratory study has been devoted by Melson to experimental reduction
of basaltic magma by graphite, a study aimed at clarification of the
conditions and products of such reductions.

Philippa Black, a visiting post-doctoral associate from the University
of Auckland, New Zealand, has been studying the chemistry, mineral-
ogy, and phase relations of the blueschist facies. The so-called eclogites
commonly recorded in glaucophane schist terrains have been proven to
be part of the normal blueschist facies. Relations between calcic and
sodic amphiboles have been studied, and the partitioning of elements
between the two amphibole phases has been shown to be a potential
geothermometer. Papers are in preparation on the occurrence of a new
omphacitic pyroxene and a previously unrecorded member of the sodic
amphibole series.

The Collections

The meteorite and tektite collections have continued to grow during
the year at an encouraging rate. A large slice of the Mount Padbury,
Western Australia, mesosiderite has been obtained by exchange with the
Kalgoorlie School of Mines, Kalgoorlie, Western Australia. Specimens
of the Boaz, Alabama, iron meteorite have been obtained by gift and
exchange from Oscar Monnig of Fort Worth, Texas. Impactite speci-
mens from K6fels crater, Austria, have been obtained by exchange with

New South Wales, and the Agen and Vouillé meteorites from France.

Small specimens from two new falls have been obtained. The Juro-
manha, Portugal, meteorite is a new and unusual iron that fell on
14 November 1968. A small study specimen has been obtained through
the cooperation of the Center for Short-Lived Phenomena and the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. A fragment from the Schenec-
tady, New York, meteorite, a fall of 12 April 1968, has been obtained
as a gift from Robert L. Fleischer, General Electric Company,
Schenectady.

The Allende, Mexico, meteorite fall of 8 February 1969 undoubtedly
is one of the great meteoritic events of our time. Brian Mason and Roy S.
Clarke, Jr., visited the fall area east of Parral, Mexico, in February
1969. They have been successful in obtaining several hundred kilograms
of this new, rare-type meteorite. More of this valuable material is being
obtained through various channels. The collection not only is large but
also it is representative of the strewnfield which is at least 45 km in
length, and perhaps amounts to 200 square kilometers. The event
was brought to the Division of Meteorite’s attention by the Center for
Short-Lived Phenomena. Cooperation with the Center has greatly aided
the investigation. The Division also has worked cooperatively with the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory Prairie Network Project on dis-
tribution of material in the field and phenomena of the fall.
A review of the specimen inventory of the Division of Petrology and
Volcanology has been completed and it has been decided that a number
of improvements are in order. The automatic-data processing (ADP) of
specimen information, a pilot program that began two years ago, is
still under way. The retrieval system is now operational, but much more
information must be processed and added to the data bank before it is
fully useful. Much progress has been made and use of the app system
will soon be routine. This will solve one of the most difficult curation
152 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

problems in rapid location of critical specimens for particular research
projects.

The research potential of the collections has been further increased by
choosing certain areas for intensive development. These are the reference
collections of deep-sea rocks and the volcanologic collections. In addi-
tion, much time has been devoted to requests for important specimens
in other areas of basic research in petrography. The United States
Geological Survey recently has instituted new mechanisms for routine
transfer of its important mineral and rock specimens. This is significant
because most of the petrology research collections have come, and must

continue to come, from the United States Geological Survey.

There have been a number of noteworthy additions to the collections

during the past year:

73 chemically analyzed igneous rocks, Silver
Peaks, Colorado

Extensive collection of ultrabasic and associ-
ated rocks, Southern Appalachians

1968-69 eruptives and prehistoric eruptives;
hypersthene-augite lavas and ash and nu-
merous basic plutonic xenoliths, Arenal
Volcano, Costa Rica

A new area has been added to the reference collection: the Volcano-

logic Study collection. This includes films, specimens, and geophysical
records pertaining to volcanic eruptions. Material for this collection
comes from Smithsonian expeditions, donations, and from the Smith-
sonian Center for Short-Lived Phenomena. Much interest has been gen-
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 153

erated in this collection, particularly in the films, which include a num-
ber of unique sequences of rare types of volcanic eruptions.

The mineral and gem collections have continued to grow at a satis-
factory and predictable rate. Growth and improvement during the year
has maintained the mineral collection in its leading position for research
and exhibition among world collections. A very active program of ex-
_ changes has been continued with other institutions and with individuals.
This has made it possible to keep up with newly discovered research
specimens as well as with extraordinary display pieces not available
through any other channels. Several species new to science and new
to the collection have been added, including weloganite, rodaguilarite,
raguinite, lithiophosphate, manganoan goldmanite, yamatoite, and
braitschite. Some of the additions have been new type specimens, in-
cluding magadiite, kenyaite, goldmanite, iowaite, hexastannite, humber-
stonite, and karelianite. Roebling endowment funds as usual have been
used primarily for acquiring new specimen materials for the research
collection. One notable exception is the finest specimen known of the
rare mineral legrandite. Canfield endowment funds have been used to
obtain several fine display specimens, including an extremely large Japa-
nese twin crystal of quartz from Brazil and a fine crystal of a new dis-
covery of tanzanite, a gem variety of zoisite, from Tanzania.

The gem collection has been enriched by several excellent gems, in-
cluding a 122.7-carat tanzanite, the largest known. Chamberlain endow-
ment funds have greatly improved representation in the collection of
the new gemstone tanzanite by the purchase of an 18.16-carat cat’s-eye
stone. Mrs. Kathryn Everhart has donated a beautiful white opal
cabachon weighing 345 carats. Harry Winston, Inc., has given a magnifi-
cent 858-carat emerald crystal from the Gachala mine in Columbia. It is
the finest emerald crystal on public exhibit anywhere.

Exhibits

R. F. Fudali has completed scripts for three exhibits in the Hall of
Meteorites, and production should be finished during this year. One
exhibit is composed of pictures of the lunar surface taken by the un-
manned Lunar Orbiter Spacecraft; one is an exhibit describing the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory’s Prairie Network; and one is
an exhibit on ancient meteorite impact craters. When these are opened,
they will complete the Hall of Meteorites, which was formally opened
two years ago.

Paul E. Desautels has continued his work on the preparation of scripts|
and exhibit materials for the new Physical Geology Hall. He also has
arranged for some changes in the gem displays. New cases for tanzanite,
the Bismark sapphire, and the Gachala emerald have been installed and
improvements have been made in other exhibit cases.

PALEOBIOLOGY

Activity in the Department has continued to be marked by a primary
emphasis in research and an increased participation in educational activ-
ities. The Departmental staff of seventeen scientists, joined by more
than twenty research associates affiliated with university faculties or
the United States Geological Survey, are closely integrated in investiga-
tion that includes almost all aspects of paleobiology and related geolog-
ical sciences.

Walter H. Adey has concluded extended field investigations of the
crustose coralline algae of the North Atlantic. He has spent three years
studying the systematics and ecology of the corallines. Distributional pat-
terns of species have been traced on the shelf areas from the mid-Atlantic
states north through the Maritimes to Greenland, Iceland, and south
to Spain. His recent activities have been centered in the Baltic area
where scuba diving has been used along the coast of Norway and the
northern coast of Europe. These data will serve for compilation of a
monograph on the North Atlantic genera.

Automatic data processing has been utilized by Nicholas Hotton
III to determine statistical parameters of osteological variation in the
skulls of living lizards. The study is now sufficiently far advanced to
suggest modification of taxonomic procedures with respect to South
African dicynodont reptiles. It appears that some of the characters
studied in lizards serve to distinguish genera but not species within a
genus. The osteological differences, however, in both lizards and dicyno-
donts by which genera are recognized are so marked and so readily in-
terpreted as adaptive that use of quantitative procedures is not necessary
for generic description. Another group of characters does serve to dis-
tinguish between species of the same genus but, when pooled with extra-
generic data, fails to distinguish between certain species of closely related
genera. Theoretically, this suggests that either there is a great deal of
adaptive parallelism among species of different genera of lizards or that
such minor osteological features are not under strong selective pressures
and vary more or less at random from population to population.

Whatever the interpretations, the taxonomic result is the same. With
the characters in question, the investigator cannot use more standard
procedures of obtaining clusters that he can call species and clusters of
clusters that he can call genera. In order to use osteological characters
to distinguish species in these animals, the genera must be determined
first. The strongly adaptive basis upon which reptilian genera are estab-
lished suggests that this procedure will be effective in dealing with the
dicynodonts.
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 157

A twice-weekly seminar was organized by bryozoan workers in the Department
of Paleobiology in the spring of 1968 and is continuing on a year-round basis.
Regular members during the past year include permanent staff A. H. Cheetham
and R. S. Boardman, predoctoral fellows O. B. Nye and Raman Singh of the
University of Cincinnati, T. G. Gautier of the University of Kansas, R. W. Hinds
of Columbia University, R. J. Scolaro of Tulane University, and United States
Geological Survey geologists O. L. Karklins and Helen Duncan. During the
year the seminar has been addressed by twelve visiting bryozoologists, including
Patricia L. Cook of the British Museum (Natural History), who is shown above
lecturing to the group during her three-month visit to the Department. Seminar
subjects have been wide ranging, from the details of bryozoan morphology to
the philosophy of evolutionary systematics. The seminar functions most success-
fully as a testing ground for new ideas resulting from continuing research of its
Participants. Ideas are presented, discussed, and modified by the seminar and
made available to all participants to use if acceptable and as appropriate to
individual projects. The seminar is, in effect, a research procedure that multiplies
the individual efforts of its members.
158 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

Foraminiferal species recovered from the estuarine Choptank River of Mary-
land’s Eastern Shore have been maintained successfully in a culture laboratory
for more than two years. The program is directed by Dr. Martin A. Buzas,
who is currently involved in studies of distributional pattern and other ecologi-
cal factors concerned with low-salinity foraminifera. Laboratory technician
Miss Brenda Williams is shown transferring specimens.

NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 159

Erle G. Kauffman has continued research in four major areas of
paleontology and stratigraphy: (1) evolution, functional morphology,
biostratigraphy, and paleoecology of select Mesozoic-Cenozoic bivalve
lineages; (2) systematic, evolutionary, and ecologic study of the dom-
inant Mesozoic bivalve family Inoceramidae; (3) lithostratigraphic and
biostratigraphic studies of Mesozoic rocks in the western interior United
States; and (4) paleontology and stratigraphy of the Caribbean
Cretaceous. Completed studies on the Mesozoic and Cenozoic
Thyasiridae, Cretaceous Inoceramidae, and Paleogene Astartidae and
Crassatellidae demonstrate the evidence of detailed evolutionary patterns
and processes in fossils and equate biological aspects of living and fossil
populations, Studies dealing with inoceramids have resulted in the first
biostratigraphic zonation of North American and Caribbean forms, with
zonal durations approaching a quarter of a million years. The ultra-
structure of inoceramid and related shells has demonstrated the pres-
ence of daily and tidal growth increments discernible as far back as the
Jurassic. Prismatic calcite and biologic response are shown to be tools in
defining earth-moon relationship during post-Paleozoic time.

Kauffman’s western interior studies have aided in a redefinition of
the biostratigraphic system for the Cretaceous and is now centered on
analyzing lithologic and biologic facies for faunal zones. More than
one hundred zones are now recognized, and integration with radio-
metric data gives durations of 120,000 to 500,000 years per zone.

Studies of functional morphology, mode of growth, and evolutionary
systematics of cheilostome Bryozoa have been continued by Alan H.
Cheetham, By applying multivariate statistics and cluster analysis to a
lineage of specialized cheilostomes, the poricellariids, Cheetham has been
able to recognize the evolution of dimorphic characters from “random”
intracolony variation in phenotypes. He is attempting to determine the
extent to which this kind of variation is the precursor of polymorphism
by extending the analysis to related lineages. In another study he is
establishing the dependence of colony form on morphologic structure of
individuals in cheilostomes from moundlike accumulations of earliest
Tertiary age in southern Scandinavia.

Cheetham has completed, with Richard S. Boardman, a review of
skeletal growth, intracolony variation, and evolution in Bryozoa, in
which major differences in the method of colony growth in different
bryozoan groups have been suggested to have phylogenetic and tax-
onomic significance. Several students working toward graduate degrees
under the direction of Boardman and Cheetham have participated in
biweekly seminars that have been well attended by visiting researchers.
Educational activities have included four full-time predoctoral fellows
160 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

and a number of visiting students in bryozoology. This concentration
is indicative of the expanded staff participation in education.

Martin A. Buzas is currently completing a study on the homogeneity
of species distribution in Rehoboth Bay, Delaware. Sixteen stations,
each ten meters apart, have been sampled with five replicates each. —
These data are being statistically analyzed by using the facilities of the —
Smithsonian Information Systems Division at Cambridge, Massa-
chusetts. In another study, the distribution and abundance of Foramini-
fera in the Pleistocene of Maryland are being examined quantitatively.
Comparison of spatial distribution, density, relative abundance, and
diversity with other Pleistocene and Holocene faunas is under way
through utilization of the information function and multivariate
statistical techniques. A study is being made with T. G. Gibson of
foraminiferal diversity based on several hundred samples from the Arctic
to the Gulf of Mexico in water depths up to 5000 meters, using the
Shannon-Weiner information function and a measure of species
equitability.

Thomas Waller has completed a study of the evolution of the most
common groups of scallops—living and fossil—found along both coasts
of North America. By means of a detailed, automated morphological
study of the living bay and calico scallops and their fossil ancestors, it has
been possible to demonstrate that during the past eighteen million years
the group displayed examples of convergence, extinction, and adaptation
in response to changing geologic and hydrographic conditions. It also
has been shown that the group has evolved more rapidly on the eastern
side of North America than on the western side. The computer pro-
grams written for the scallop study have been modified in order to
make them adaptable to the analysis of shape and growth in a wide
variety of organisms.

Dominant patterns of sedimentation in deep Mediterranean basins
are being examined by Daniel J. Stanley. Sedimentary deposits ob-
served in these modern basins are being compared with those of similar
ancient marine rocks, known as flysch, exposed in the Alps, Carpathians,
and other mountain belts of the world. As part of this study Stanley
has participated on a seismic and core-collecting cruise sponsored by
NATO in the Alboran Sea between Morocco and Spain. He is also com-
pleting a preliminary regional reconnaissance of the recent marine geo-
logical history of the Mediterranean Sea and is making detailed studies
of the Wilmington submarine canyon off the east coast of the United
States. Projects in the canyon and adjacent slope, partly supported by
the United States Coast Guard, include an evaluation of sediment
texture and structures as influenced by such factors as bottom currents
and the influence of bottom-living organisms.

The Collections

The departmental collections have been strengthened by the great-
est increase in many years of specimens from important foreign locali-
ties. Staff field excursions have added to previously weak parts of both
the invertebrate and vertebrate collections, while exchanges and pur-
chases through contacts made at foreign universities and museums sur-
pass any such activities in the Department’s recent history.

Porter M. Kier has visited many type-localities in England and
southern France while completing a tour at Cambridge University as a
Guggenheim Fellow. He was accompanied and guided by research
associate Anthony Coates through parts of France, accumulating large
collections of Mesozoic and younger invertebrates. The coelenterates
and echinoderms among these materials are particularly important as
they represent many species new to the Museum collections. In southern
France, Alan Cheetham has made extensive collections of Tertiary and
Upper Cretaceous Bryozoa from the Aquitaine Basin. Cheetham also
has visited localities in Italy, Denmark, England, and—of particular
importance—the area between the Holy Cross and Carpathian Moun-
tains in Poland. Samples prepared from these collections have yielded
many topotype suites of species.

In company with colleagues from the Carnegie Museum and the
University of Utrecht, Clayton Ray has collected Pleistocene mammals
in Sardinia, Sicily, Malta, and Mallorca. The most significant acquisi-
tion has been a series of specimens of the extinct artiodactyl Myotragus
balearicus from Mallorca, received from William Waldren.

Other valuable collections include general invertebrates from the
Cretaceous of the Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico by Erle G. Kauffman;
fossil deep-sea ostracoda from localities in India, Israel, Czechoslovakia,
Yugoslavia, Turkey, Cyprus, and Sicily by Richard Benson; Brachiopods
from England and Poland by G. A. Cooper; mollusks from the Carib-
bean by Thomas Waller; and a major collection of fusulinid foraminif-
era from the upper Paleozoic of Yugoslavia, Tunisia, Cyprus, and Tur-
key collected for the Museum by Raymond C. Douglass and Merlynd
Nestell. In total, these field collections will produce thousands of speci-
mens new to the Museum.

The most outstanding single foreign collection has been added by
purchase as a gift of the Walcott Fund. It is composed of more than
6,000 specimens, most of them carefully prepared, which represent one
of the finest collections ever made from the classic Jurassic sequence of
the Swiss Jura. The collection represents more than forty years of work
by the collector, Zuber Oberlé, and is meticulously labeled and docu-
mented. The brachiopods and sponges are of exceptional importance
162 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

while the cephalopod species represented are used as a standard
throughout the world. This magnificent addition to the invertebrate
collection will aid in better fulfilling the responsibility of the Museum as
a repository of material used for cosmopolitan studies by staff and pro-
fessional visitors from throughout the world. Most of the species are
new to the collections and previously have been represented only sparsely
in any American collections.

Exchanges with the British Museum resulting from trips funded by
the Walcott bequest have been arranged by Frederick Collier, Porter

Museum technician Sigmund Sweda exposes the skeleton on an extinct peccary,

Kier, and G. A. Cooper. Several thousand specimens have been trans-
ferred in this program. Many new species of mollusca, brachiopods, and
echinoderms from Great Britain have been added to the collections and
the possibility of further exchanges is being arranged.

Notable additions to the collections from domestic sources include
tens of thousands of specimens comprehending thousands of type speci-
mens transferred from the United States Geological Survey or received
from researchers throughout the country. The Walcott bequest has
provided for a number of outstanding purchases or collecting trips.
These include the purchase of more than 12,000 deep-sea ostracodes
recovered from cores provided by Lamont Laboratories. The cores have
been taken from stations all over the world and represent an unprece-
dented sampling of these microfossils from depths as great as 4,000
meters and an age of more than 20 million years. Ostracodes are the
only group of higher invertebrates found in deep-sea sediments that
have a good fossil record with the resulting potential for geologic cor-
relation of time and environmental boundaries. Other significant addi-
164 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

tions include 24,000 Silurian and Devonian brachiopods from Nevada
and Southern California donated by research associate A. J. Boucot,
and more than 5,000 invertebrates from the Paleozoic of Oklahoma,
Mississippi, and Ohio made by G. A. Cooper and Thomas Phelan. The
paleobotanical collections have received many type specimens, includ-

ing palynomorphs from the Middle Cretaceous of Peru, the holotype of |
Williamsonia nizhonia -Ash with thirteen cuticle preparations, speci- |

mens of Cretaceous algae from the Black Escarpment and Israel, and
others of importance.

Intensified collecting of fossil marine mammals and less-abundant
vertebrates from the classical Miocene localities of southern Maryland
has produced numerous additions to the fossil vertebrate collections.
Close cooperation by residents and amateur collectors has enabled
early recovery of many pieces before weathering damage can occur.
Albert Myrick has represented the Department in organizing a volun-
teer collecting team and clearinghouse for information regarding new

exposures. Rare specimens added through these efforts include frag-

mentary mandibles of Hadrodelphis calvertense, about two dozen por-
poise skulls, several turtle and fish specimens, posterior rami of both
mandibles of the rare Miocene peccary Desmathyus, and an unerupted
gomphothere molar. Other notable additions include snake vertebrae
from a Eocene-Bashi formation and a cast of the skeleton of Paleopara-
doxia from the Museum of Paleontology, University of California,
Berkeley.

The Division of Sedimentology has acquired bottom-grab and dredge
samples and deep-sea cores from the continental slope and rise in the
vicinity of the Wilmington Canyon collected on joint Smithsonian-
United States Coast Guard cruises. Sediment samples added to the col-
lection include those obtained in coastal environments of North Caro-
lina (collected in conjunction with the University of South Carolina)
and in the Hatteras abyssal plain (collected on joint Smithsonian-
United States Coast Guard and NAvocEANo cruises). Also received are
bottom samples collected on the continental shelf of Argentina as part
of a cooperative project with the National Oceanographic Committee
of Argentina, the Hydrographic Service of Argentina, the United
States Coast Guard, and George Washington University.

Curation of the collections continues to center on the processing of
type specimens. In all divisions there has been movement toward
eventual automatic data processing, but type specimens must be fully
curated and verified against published descriptions and illustrations
before information can be put into any automatic system. The paleo-

botanical type-collections and fossil vertebrate types are not seriously —

backlogged in initial processing, but fossil invertebrate type specimens
NATIONAL MUSEUM OF NATURAL HISTORY 165

continue to be received at an increasing rate. More than forty papers,
including some six to seven thousand specimens, have been processed
this year by cataloger (Mrs.) Beverly Tate. The procedures in recording
invertebrate specimens have been altered by changing to loose-leaf
catalogs with typewritten entries. The information in this form will be
more accessible for entry into an automated system and is more rapidly
recorded.

Several collections have been rearranged to facilitate storage or to
improve use and accessibility. The Paleozoic bivalve mollusks have
been moved into a biologically arranged system comprising several
thousand species, and the first biologically arranged Mesozoic ammonite
and bivalve collections have been formed. A start has been made on a
complete revision of the fossil mammal collection to be based on a
faunal-stratigraphic plan.

The greatest demand on collections and laboratory facilities of the
Department have involved the increased use of predoctoral and post-
doctoral fellows and visiting scientists and students. Ten study kiosks
and increased desk space in the range areas, as well as increased labora-
tory space and equipment, have been almost constantly in use.

Exhibits

Major emphasis in the Vertebrate Paleontology laboratories has con-
tinued to be placed on preparation of specimens for exhibition. Work
has continued on several individual glyptodonts, on a composite skeleton
of wooly mammoth, and on a family group of peccaries. A second
mounted individual of the giant ground sloth Eremothertum has been
completed.

Special attention in field work has been given to the acquisition of
specimens for exhibition. Large collections of the extinct lagomorph
Prolagus sardus have been made in Sardinia. Several skeletons have
been mounted by Daniel Opplinger at the Carnegie Museum under
the direction of Mary R. Dawson. One of these will be provided for
exhibit at the Smithsonian. Materials of extinct dormice and of Myotra-
gus balearicus also have been obtained in the Mediterranean for future
exhibit.

The Division of Paleobotany is cooperating with the Department of
Mineral Sciences in the construction of a Carboniferous swamp diorama
in the Hall of Physical Geology. Consultation with artists of the exhibits
staff also has involved the illustration of Mesozoic plants to be presented
in mural form in the dinosaur hall.

Frep L. WuipPLe, Director

OR THE FIRST TIME, THIS REPORT of the work conducted by the

Astrophysical Observatory is limited to a close view of only a few
of the numerous areas in which great progress has been made during
the current year. This new policy permits examination in subsequent
years of other areas selected so as to give a full view of Observatory
activities in a sequence of four or five annual reports. The titles of staff
papers presented or published, as listed at the end of this report, give
a thumbnail sketch of the research completed.

No significant policy changes in the Observatory research program
have been initiated this year except that unusual effort has been ex-
pended toward the most efficient utilization of brainpower, funds, and

‘facilities with the goal of uncovering as much knowledge and under-
standing as possible about the universe in which we live and about
'man’s interrelationships with this universe.

)
GEODESY AND EARTH PHYSICS FROM SPACE

For a multitude of his enterprises, man must know the coordinates
of points on, above, or below the earth’s surface. Points on the earth
are not, of course, fixed in space and time. The earth-moon system
moves in its orbit about the sun while the earth and moon follow orbits
about their center of mass and while the earth rotates about a slowly
changing axis. Also, locations on the surface change because of processes
within the solid, liquid, and gaseous domains of the earth. To this com-
plex dynamical system, man has added spacecraft that sense the details
of the system without themselves influencing its workings.

Fundamental physics asserts that the only way to mark a point is by
reference to objects possessing mass. But all objects with mass are

171
172 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

attracted mutually in accordance with the laws of gravitation, and these
laws dominate in governing the complex motions in which the earth
and its satellites participate. Hence, the mass distribution and the gravi-
tational field of the earth are fundamentally linked to the problem of
locating points.

Traditionally, relative positions and gravity on the surface of the
earth, the motions of the earth, and the associated physical processes are
recognized as principal objectives of branches of the geosciences and
astronomy.

These disciplines have the common characteristic that they are based
upon measurements of distance and direction and their time dependence.
The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory has pioneered in the ap-
plication of space technology to a broad span of related metric problems.

Evolution of Instrumentation and Techniques *

Preparations to observe artificia] satellites and to calculate their posi-
tions were important aspects of the first satellite programs. By the time
satellites became a reality, special cameras developed under the direc-
tion of Fred L. Whipple were ready to photograph an illuminated
satellite against the star background. These Baker-Nunn cameras de-
signed for sao produce camera-to-satellite directions accurate to a few
seconds of arc. For a typical orbit, this angular uncertainty corresponds
to a positional uncertainty of a few tens of meters. Radio doppler tracking
also began with the first United States satellite; this technique as per-
fected by the Applied Physics Laboratory of the Johns Hopkins Uni-
versity has demonstrated accuracy comparable to that of camera
tracking.

During most of the first decade of the space age, the 10-meter ac-
curacy characterizing the various photographic and doppler systems
surpassed the precision with which their data could be fitted by theory.

By about 1966, agreement between theory and data came into sight,
and interest in improved tracking systems grew.

Ranging to satellites with light pulses from a ruby laser was perhaps
the first new technique promising 1-meter resolution or better.* For this
system, the satellites need carry only retroreflectors in the form of cube-
cornered mirrors. At this writing, six satellites with retroreflectors are
in orbit, and several laser systems, including three at sao sites, are op-
erating, typically at the 1-meter accuracy level. No major obstacles seem
to stand in the way of 10-centimeter accuracy in a few years.

A second instrumentation breakthrough is long-baseline radio inter-
ferometry over thousands of miles, with independent atomic clocks.*

Phe sao-Harvard radio telescope is being equipped for these measure-
nents. As with any interferometer system, the fundamental measure-
ment is a range difference that can be translated into an angle relative
(0 the baseline.

The use of an altimeter on a satellite is an old idea that now seems
imely for implementation. As currently conceived by the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration, this third instrumentation ad-
vance would use radar techniques over the ocean to attain meter-or-

174 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969.

better accuracies. Other systems being readied include devices to com-
pensate for surface forces on a satellite and instruments for satellite-to-
satellite tracking. sAo is preparing techniques to analyze data from such
systems.

Evolution of Geodetic Applications *

In 1964, with the establishment of the National Geodetic Satellite
Program, a set of national objectives was adopted, embracing goals rea-
sonably attainable with the systems then available. As currently formu-
lated, the two major objectives are (1) the establishment of a unified
world datum referenced to the center of mass of the earth, in which
about ninety station locations are to be positioned with an accuracy of
ten meters, and (2) the determination of values of the coefficients of the
spherical-harmonic representation of the gravitational field of the earth
to the 15th degree and order.

The objectives of the national program now seem within sight of
fulfillment. Results at sao reported during 1969 by Kurt Lambeck estab-
lish a world datum as required by the first objective and give positions
of some forty stations. Geopotential coefficients determined during this
year by Edward M. Gaposchkin of sao and Yoshihide Kozai of sao
and Tokyo University nearly satisfy the second objective. These results
are being compiled in the new Smithsonian Institution Standard Earth.

Thought and action toward other applications and objectives have
begun, stimulated in part by the progress toward the announced national
objectives. An equally significant stimulus has been the instrumentation
progress sketched above.

Geopotential and Mass Distribution *

The gravitational potential of the earth is a manifestation of the mass
distribution within the earth. As determinations of the potential improve
and as they come to represent smaller features of the field, their implica-
tions for geology rise sharply. Over the oceans, very fine geoid detail
from a satellite altimeter can have great geological significance for large
regions of the earth that have had little study.

Earth Tides *

Earth tides due to the sun and moon are prime examples of
phenomena whose investigation by satellite techniques became possible
SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY 175

only when orbit determination attained accuracies of a few seconds of
arc. In principle, at least two aspects of earth tides can be studied.

The most obvious effect is the motion of a tracking instrument as its
foundation rides with the tides in the solid earth. The radial deformation
of the earth under conditions of maximum change has a range of some
thirty centimeters. Motions of this amplitude should be detectable by
the most precise tracking instruments, but a suitable observing campaign
has yet to be mounted. Robert Newton of the Applied Physics Labora-
tory and Kozai have detected the satellite orbital perturbations cor-
responding to the mass displacement. Analyses by both authors have
obtained a measure of the gross elastic properties of the earth.

The elastic coefficients derived from satellite orbits agree reasonably
with the value derived from astronomical observations and the theory
of the Chandler wobble of the earth’s pole.

Polar Motion *

The earth rotates about an axis that continually changes. First, the
direction of the angular momentum vector in space has a 26,000-year
cycle caused mainly by torques from lunar and solar gravitational inter-
tions with the oblateness of the earth. This is called astronomical
recession and nutation.

Second, the axis about which the earth rotates at any instant, ex-
oressed relative to body-fixed coordinates, performs a precession. This
can have an amplitude of roughly 0.5 arcsec. The motion involves two
periods, one of twelve months and the other of about fourteen.

Third, the position of the principal axis of inertia for the earth,
Le., its current rotation axis, is not necessarily fixed relative to some set
of axes attached to the earth. Besides the obvious possibilities of mass
displacement in the fluid domains of the earth, there recently has been
a suggestion that mass displacements associated with earthquakes may
contribute observable changes.

Satellites offer several new but untried avenues for further investi-
gations of polar motion. If the conventional corrections for polar motion
are not introduced into the analysis of satellite observations, station
positions should show an apparent variation corresponding to the wobble
of the earth beneath the satellite. Polar-motion measurements of
superior accuracy may result from long-baseline interferometry with
independent atomic clocks at two or more radio telescopes.

An exciting possibility from satellite observations concerns the deter-
mination of the location of the principal axis with maximum

>
176 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969
moment of inertia, using analysis techniques developed for geopotential
determinations.

Rotation of the Earth *

The rate of rotation of the earth about its instantaneous axis is not
a constant when measured against atomic clocks; that is, the sidereal.
length of the day is not constant. There is some possibility that those
variations may be determined from the satellite analyses themselves.
It is more likely that improved techniques, such as long-baseline radio
interferometry, will eventually provide refined tabulations.

Satellite techniques may also contribute to an understanding of the
origin of these variations. There may be mass displacements that change
the moment of inertia of the earth, and these changes should be
accompanied by changes in the geopotential coefficients.

Crustal Motions *

An attempt to measure the relative motion of crustal blocks, ie..
continental drift, is by far the most difficult task seriously contemplated
for techniques of satellite geodesy. Yet this phenomenon is one of the
most actively discussed today in earth science. Two recent global models
can be applied to predict the relative horizontal velocities that might
be expected for any two points on the earth’s surface. These have been
applied to sao sites by Paul A. Mohr. The maximum rate is about ten
centimeters per year. Because laser and interferometer techniques are
approaching this accuracy and because an observing campaign could
cover several years, measurement of crustal block motion is a reasonable
goal for the second decade of the space age.

Ocean Profile *

In the open ocean, the sea level averaged over wave structure should
be an equipotential surface within an uncertainty of a few meters.
Dynamical variations due to tides, currents, cyclones, and similar
phenomena of great interest in oceanography seem to have amplitudes
of less than a few meters. Hence, the use of satellite-borne altimeters
to sense sea level might progress through two phases. In the first, the
equipotential surface corresponding to mean sea level would be deter-
mined to an accuracy of one meter or better. In the second phase,
refined altimeters would probe dynamical changes in the ocean surface.
MITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY Ds
oordinated Observation Campaigns *

Clearly, the problems discussed above are intimately interrelated in
complex ways, and certainly there are other related topics not discussed
ere that will emerge later with major importance. Many investigations
of a broad range of questions can be based on the same observational
material if the design of the observing campaign anticipates this need.
Iso, some of the investigations may require coordinated observations
Tom quite different instruments—e.g., laser networks and radio inter-
erometers. Still further, most of the topics are global in scope and there-
Ore require that observing sites be well distributed geographically.
The organization of a coordinated observation and analysis effort of
he scale required is a formidable problem in itself, to which sao is
Ow expanding its attention.

MAJOR METEORITE RECOVERIES OF 1968-69

The scientific value of information gathered from a meteorite is
sreatly enhanced if the object can be analyzed within a few weeks or
ven a few days after its fall. Such material fresh from interplanetary
pace contains traces of radioactivity that afford unique information
‘bout the solar system’s history. ;

This past year has been an unusually productive one for scientists
aterested in the quick recovery of meteorites. Four large meteorites
iave been recovered, each within a few days of its fall.

On Friday, 12 April 1968, at 8:30 p.m., a meteorite struck the roof
f the home of Joseph W. Kowalski in Schenectady, New York, splinter-
4g a portion of the eaves and rebounding onto the ground. Mr. Kowal-
ki, who was watching television at the time, heard what he later
lescribed as a sound “like a firecracker going off in the attic.” Two
lays later, on returning home from church, he observed the broken
aves, noted the nature of the damage, searched the grounds adjacent
2 his home, and recovered from alongside his house a single chrondritic
tone meteorite of mass 283.3 grams. Its exterior consists primarily of

dull black fusion crust plus a fracture surface that was apparently
roduced by breakup in the atmosphere.

During its existence in space (in this Case, as a small body of one-
aeter radius or less), a meteoroid is exposed to cosmic rays, which
ause nuclear reactions and produce radioactive and stable atomic
pecies. After it has fallen, however, the meteorite is protected from
Osmic rays by the earth’s atmosphere and there is little subsequent
iotope production. From laboratory measurements of a stable product

;
;
-
178 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

and a radioactive one, it is possible to determine the duration of cosmic-
ray exposure, which is called the exposure age.

Edward L. Fireman ® has measured the cosmic-ray exposure age of
this meteorite and has placed it at 31.4 million years. This age plus
measurements of the densities of cosmic-ray tracks in olivine and
pyroxene crystals at four positions in the meteorite give evidence that
the specimen came from a depth between 5 and 10 centimeters in 2
preatmospheric body of greater than 15-centimeter radius. Th
uranium/helium-4 and krypton/argon-40 ages, which are 4.1 billion
years and 4.35 billion years, respectively, indicate that the meteorite
underwent very little heating in space since it became solid.

On 14 November 1968, at about 6 P.m., a 25-kilogram iron meteorite
fell only thirty meters from where a farmer was standing in a field neai
Alandroal, Portugal. Robert A. Citron, director of the Smithsonian
Center for Short-Lived Phenomena, learned about this fall on 2 Decem:
ber and arranged for a specimen to be sent to sao for analysis.® Ii
arrived on 14 December, only thirty days after the fall. The meteorite
is called both Alandroal and Juromenha. |

Matthias F. Comerford has investigated its metallography 7 and ha.
found that if the object had ever had the octahedral pattern normall
expected of iron meteorites, the pattern had been destroyed by at least i
single-stage melting event and more probably by a two-stage melting
freezing plus deformation-and-annealing history. His investigation ha’
further indicated that the structure of the meteorite is similar to tha
of the Washington County iron, which is an unusual meteorite becaus'
it has 8.7 percent nickel but no Widmanstatten pattern, a distinctiv:
crystallization feature usually found in irons.

Because study of Alandroal began only one month after fall, certain o
the short-lived radioactivities could be measured with considerable ac
curacy, giving new information about cosmic rays in interplanetar
space. Fireman has measured the argon-37, argon-39, and tritium radio
activities and the rare-gas content.® He has found that the argon-37,
argon-39 ratio in Alandroal is the lowest ever measured in am
meteorite.

From this ratio, Fireman has found that the exposure age of Alan
droal is 33 million years. This means that Alandroal was covered witl
protective material until 33 million years ago, when it collided with an
other body or otherwise had its protective covering ripped away anc
the present meteoritic material exposed to space. Another conclusior
is that the cosmic-ray flux per unit time bombarding Alandroal durin;
the fifty days before the meteorite struck the earth was only half as grea
as the average flux during the last 400 years. This ratio means that the
SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY 179

cosmic-ray flux at 3+1 astronomical units from the sun is twice as high
as at 1 astronomical unit.
_ Less than three months later, on 8 February 1969, at 1:05 a.m., a
spectacular fireball lit up the sky over Arizona, New Mexico, and north-
ern Mexico. A shower of stones fell over an area of approximately 100
square miles around Pueblito de Allende in Southern Chihuahua, Mex-
ico, approximately twenty miles east of the city of Hidalgo del Parral.

When news of this event reached sao, the Center for Short-Lived
Phenomena immediately alerted the Air Force. A B—57 aircraft fol-
lowed the winds over the Gulf of Mexico for seven hours to collect
airborne dust ablated from the meteoroid. Citron quickly located peo-
ple who had recovered specimens and he notified scientists of the fall.
Charles A. Tougas and Gunther Schwartz traveled to the site to obtain
trajectory data; from these data and from the distribution of material
on the ground, Richard E. McCrosky has been able to deduce that the
preatmospheric mass of the meteorite exceeded twenty tons.°

An intensive study of a piece of this meteorite has been carried out by
Ursula B. Marvin, John A. Wood, and John S. Dickey, Jr.® It has
proved to be a rare type III carbonaceous chondrite containing
chondrules and irregular masses that depart radically in mineralogy and
chemistry from the matrix and from the bulk composition of other stony

Dr. Fireman examines the meteorite Pueblito de Allende in his laboratory.

180 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

meteorites. Patches of material abnormally rich in aluminum have been
discovered, along with one mineral (hercynite, FeAl,O,) new to meteo-
rites. Also a melilitic glass has been found that is new to meteorites.

Fireman has determined from the neon in Allende that the cosmic-ray
exposure age of this meteorite is five million years. Evidently this is the
interval since it broke out of a larger object during a possible collision
in space. The exposure ages of other carbonaceous chondrites range
from 0.2 to 50 million years.

The most unusual feature of the rare gases contained in Allende is
the isotopic composition of the xenon in the chondrules. Chondrules
are spherical globules, a few millimeters in diameter, of what looks like
rock that once was melted but is now embedded in a fine-grained dust-
like matrix. Fireman has found that the xenon in the chondrules is
practically pure xenon-129, with only 1/100 as much xenon-132. This
is in sharp contrast to the xenon in the earth’s atmosphere, where these
two isotopes are nearly equally represented. Excesses of xenon-129 have
been found in other chondrules, but never so pronounced as in the
present case. The xenon-129 is believed to have arisen from the long-
extinct radioactive isotope of iodine-129, which was created when the
elements were formed. If this is true, then to have contained such a high
amount of xenon-129, the chondrules of Allende must have been
formed very soon after the creation of the elements.

To judge from the amount of material recovered, Pueblito de Allende
has the distinction of being the largest carbonaceous chondrite known.
The first known meteorite of this type fell near Alais, France, on 15
March 1806, only a few years after scientists accepted the reality of
“stones from the sky.” Allende is the 27th carbonaceous chondrite found.
Since the total weight of material in collections from the 26 previous
cases is only slightly greater than 100 kilograms, the world supply of
carbonaceous chondrite matter has been more than quadrupled by the
addition of over 350 kilograms recovered from this meteorite.

On 25 April 1969, a farmer saw a large fireball streak across the sky
near Belfast, Ireland. It was seen to fall in a bog in Sprucefield, and
several pieces of the meteorite were recovered. A sample has been ana-
lyzed by Fireman for radioactive and stable rare-gas isotopes. The radio-
activities of argon-37 and argon-39 have been measured in the magnetic
and nonmagnetic phases. The argon-37/argon-39 ratio gives a value of
0.900.009 for the iron phase, which is considerably higher than the
ratio measured in Alandroal. Since Sprucefield and Alandroal both fell
during the same period of the same solar cycle, Sprucefield’s orbit must _
have been different from that of Alandroal. In order to have a higher |
argon-37/argon-39 ratio, Sprucefield’s orbit must have had a smaller
semimajor axis. The stable rare-gas isotopes of helium, neon, and argon

SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY 181

are very low, indicating that the meteoroid was recently heated. The
exposure age of 1.6 million years obtained from helium-3 and neon-21
is less than one tenth the age obtained from xenon-126, which is 20
million years. This recent heating is in accord with an orbit with a small
semimajor axis.

Several of the analyses of these meteorites have been made in part
with special equipment designed and built by sao for the study of
lunar samples, beginning in the fall of 1969.° °

ATOMIC AND MOLECULAR PROCESSES

In a very general sense, the study of atomic and molecular processes
refers to the collisions of an atom, molecule, electron, or proton with
another such particle. Because of the quantal nature of these particles,
a variety of interesting effects can be observed.

The knowledge both of the different types of atomic and molecular
processes and of the rates at which these reactions proceed is essential
to the basic understanding of many aspects of modern science and tech-
nology. There are numerous applications in astrophysics, geophysics,
aeronomy, meteors, controlled fusion, magnetohydrodynamic power
conversion generators, plasma motors, and gas lasers that impose
stringent requirements on both identifying and determining accurate
probabilities of various atomic and molecular processes. For example,
the impact of atoms evaporated from a meteor with the atmospheric
atomic and molecular constituents causes the optical and ionization
phenomena produced when a meteor enters the upper atmosphere. In
addition, the ionosphere of the earth is produced mainly by the ioniza-
tion of the neutral-particle constituents of the atmosphere by solar ultra-
violet radiation. This ionization process leads to the production of free
‘electrons and positive ions, which cause excitation of the neutral par-
ticles, with the subsequent emission of light (dayglow). Knowledge of
atomic and molecular processes further enhances our understanding
of such fields as health physics and biochemistry.

Alex Dalgarno and his group have carried out theoretical studies of
a wide range of collision processes involving the interaction of radiation
with electrons, atoms, and molecules found in the atmospheres of the
planets, in the solar corona, and in the interstellar medium.’® Space
science has opened up a new, wide field of observation in the far ultra-
violet where these processes produce direction radiation.

One of the areas of atomic and molecular physics to which they have
given special attention is the absorption of ultraviolet radiation by
helium and hydrogen molecules. In addition to their importance to
182 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

molecular spectroscopy, the absorption processes in hydrogen provide
an efficient mechanism for the dissociation of a hydrogen molecule into)
two hydrogen atoms. The calculation by Arthur C. Allison of accurate:
transition probabilities for the Lyman and Werner systems is the neces-
sary first step in the calculation of the dissociation of molecular hydrogen:
by radiation with ultraviolet wavelengths around 1000 angstroms. The:
cross sections he has computed have been used in a discussion of the
abundance of hydrogen in the atmosphere of Venus. Kenneth M. Sando
has completed a detailed analysis of both the absorption and the emis-
sion of radiation in specific helium transitions that have been studied in
the laboratory. Dalgarno and his group have also begun a study of
the quadrupole emission spectrum that results from the primary ultra-
violet absorption.

Further, this group has continued studies of the processes controlling
the decay of excited states of the helium-like ions in the solar corona
and has completed the first purely theoretical predictions of the proba-
bilities of intercombination of spectral transitions. Gordon W. F. Drake
has carried out variational calculations to determine accurately the rates
of these radiative processes as a function of nuclear change. He also has
calculated spin-orbit mixing parameters and relativistic corrections to
the energy levels. In addition, he has developed a theory of induced
radiative deactivation of metastable ions by collision with charged par-
ticles. This theory has been used to obtain results for the metastable
helium-like ions.

The group also has explored the effects of collision-induced fine-
structure transitions that give rise to infrared emission. Robert H. G.
Reid has devoted particular attention to this work and has been in-
volved in the development of a new theoretical formulation that predicts
the occurrence of oscillations in the collision probabilities arising from a
resonance-like phenomenon.

Methods for calculating the effects of collisions between electrons
and heteronuclear molecules such as cN and oH have been developed
this year. Calculations on cn have been completed.

Several members of this group have continued fundamental studies
of the quantum mechanics of atomic and molecular structure. By means
of extension of the z-expansion technique to high order, Drake has
provided accurate wavefunctions for the entire isoelectric sequence
in a single calculation. Paul Blanchard has carried out a theoretical
investigation of quantum defects in 2- and 3-electron atomic systems
with the aid of the z-expansion perturbation theory, as developed by
Dalgarno and David Layzer (of Harvard College Observatory).
Michael Jamieson has completed his PhD dissertation, entitled Time-
Dependent Hartree-Fock Theory, on this subject. Dalgarno believes

SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY 183

that this construction of a general form of perturbation theory shows
much promise as a procedure for studying correlation effects.

Investigations of collision broadening effects in the wings of spectral
lines have continued. Sando has begun a study of the contribution to the
absorption in the Lyman-alpha wing. Dalgarno and his coworkers have
completed a study of the luminosity appearing in the upper atmosphere
of the planet earth as a consequence of collisions of the fast photo-
electrons released by the action of solar ultraviolet radiation.

M. Raymond Flannery and Hiram Levy II have continued their
tudies of atomic and molecular processes as they relate to meteor
trails?! They have developed an analytic form for the interaction matrix
elements in the hydrogen-hydrogen collision system and have prepared
impact-parameter calculations of cross sections for the excitation of both
atoms.

Flannery has continued investigations of various recombination
mechanisms that contribute to the electron loss from a meteor trail.
The rate of decay of the radar echo from the meteor trail gives a meas-
ure of the decrease of electron concentration in the trail.

Levy is currently working on two calculations of particular impor-
tance. The first is a method for determining first Born-wave excitation
and ionization cross sections for the collision of two atoms. The second
calculation involves multistate impact-parameter cross sections.

Theoretical studies of atomic and molecular processes are supported
not only by laboratory work but also by means of astronomical instru-
ments and space experiments.

Anthony R. Lee and Nathaniel P. Carleton have completed a series
of laboratory measurements on the excitation by electron impact on
the ions of calcium, barium, and strontium. Thus far, there have been
no laboratory measurements of this collision process, which is vitally
important in the formation of the spectral lines of these ions.

Ashok Sharma, Wesley A. Traub, and Carleton also have been con-
structing a three-etalon Fabry-Perot interferometer system for high-
resolution spectrometric work at Agassiz Station and at Mount Hop-
kins.1? This instrument is designed to be very flexible in terms of wave-
length coverage and resolving power, having specially designed reflecting
coatings on the etalons. It will be used to continue the program of high-
resolution planetary spectroscopy that is currently under way, with in-
vestigations of methane rotational temperature on Jupiter and of photo-
chemical processes involving oxygen on Venus and Mars. A search is
so planned for deuterium in the spectrum of Jupiter and in certain
planetary nebulae.
184 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

STUDYING THE SUN

The sun, a star among unimaginably many others, is uniquely close.
We can observe what it is and how it behaves much more thoroughly
than we can any other star. Yet the data we have already accumulated |
raise at least as many questions as they answer, for they reveal the enor-
mous complexity of the solar atmosphere. Theoretical studies have:
now progressed to the point where they account for many separate solar
phenomena, but many of the most fundamental aspects of the sun re-
main unexplained. Familiar examples include sunspots and the solar
corona, the origins of which are still not understood. sao is contributing)
heavily to our understanding of these and related phenomena.

Exciting new observations of the infrared region of the spectrum of!
sunspots are now available. This material is being obtained by Robert W.
Noyes and Donald N. Hall (the latter of the Harvard Astronomy De-
partment) , who have jointly initiated a major program of high-resolution
infrared spectroscopy of sunspots, using the vacuum spectrograph at
the McMath Solar Telescope of Kitt Peak National Observatory.

These infrared observations have enabled Noyes and Hall to make the
first identification of solar fluorine in the form of hydrofluoric acid)
molecules in sunspots. They also have mapped the first-overtone spec-
trum of carbon monoxide to very high quantum numbers and have ob-
tained high-resolution observations of highly excited levels of overtone
bands of on. They are in the process of extending their observations
farther into the infrared with a new infrared spectrograph under con-
struction at Kitt Peak National Observatory.

In order to interpret the new sunspot data, Noyes has begun to cal-
culate theoretical sunspot models, using a computer program developed
by Owen Gingerich and Duane F. Carbon at sao. There has resulted a
rather precise value for the abundance of fluorine in the sun as well as
information on sunspot structure.

Solar physicists have long worked to establish satisfactorily how the
temperature varies with height in the sun’s atmosphere. The procedure
is as follows: The details of many observed features of the radiation
from a star, such as the continuous spectrum or individual absorption
lines, are determined in part by the star’s temperature structure. Using
theories that specify how the spectrum and the temperature structure
are related, we build computer programs to calculate (hypothetical)
model solar atmospheres and synthetic solar spectra. With such programs
we attempt, largely by trial and error, to construct a temperature struc-
ture that causes the model to give rise to synthetic spectra that agree in
all essential details with the observed ones. The more complete our

observational material, the better fixed are the details of the temperature
structure.

New observations have been obtained by the Harvard College Ob-
servatory spectroheliometer on board the fourth Orbiting Solar Ob-
servatory (oso) .1* These data have enabled Harvard and Smithsonian
scientists to make new studies toward understanding the structure of the

upper solar atmosphere. Gingerich, in part jointly with Noyes and

366-269 O—70 13

186 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

Yvette Cuny, has used new data to derive a new empirical model of the
temperature structure of the solar atmosphere.

Because of its position outside the atmosphere, oso 4 has provided
new observations in the far ultraviolet spectrum of the sun’s hydrogen.
Any model of the solar atmosphere should not only reproduce this spec-
trum at any point of the sun’s disk but also give its variation from center
to limb. Noyes and Wolfgang Kalkofen, using the latter’s model atmos-
phere program, have obtained for the low solar chromosphere a tempera-
ture and density structure that produces correctly the general features
of this radiation: emission of the continuum radiation from a region
where the kinetic temperature is about 8500°K, with a decrease in the
intensity for wavelengths near the head of the continuum as we look
from the center to the limb (limb darkening), and a corresponding in-
crease (limb brightening) at shorter wavelengths. Eugene H. Avrett,
using a program he and Rudolf Loeser have been developing over sev-
eral years, also has tried to obtain a temperature structure conforming
to the observed Lyman radiation; his results differ from those of Noyes
and Kalkofen. Reasons for the discrepancy may become clear as Avrett’s
work continues.

Casual observation discloses that neither the sun’s atmosphere nor
those of other stars resemble what we must assume in our calculations:
a series of flat layers of unlimited extent, the same everywhere, and never
changing. Even this apparent simplicity has necessitated several decades
of development of mathematical procedures, much of it here at sao, to
allow us to compute effectively. But we need to treat more complex
geometries: in the large, atmospheres are shells, not planes; in the
small, the shapes of relevant segments are more complex still. And we
need to take inhomogeneities and dynamics into account: We can ob-
serve atmospheric motions, such as convection currents and flares in
the sun, and motions of entire atmospheres, in pulsating stars. Sunspots
remind us that the solar atmosphere is not the same everywhere.

THE CELESCOPE EXPERIMENT *

Until very recently, astronomers have been forced to conduct their
observations from the bottom of the earth’s atmosphere, which signifi-
cantly limits the accuracy, sensitivity, and scope of their observations.
Important classes of objects, such as the x-ray stars, lay undiscovered
pending man’s ability to place the necessary instruments above the
absorbing layers of the atmosphere. In order to confirm and refine
the relevant theoretical concepts, important physical processes, such as
those occurring in the atmospheres of the hotter stars, require observa-

tions in that part of the ultraviolet spectrum that is totally absorbed by
the atmosphere. Studies of remote galaxies, needed for refining our
theories of the universe, have been hampered by the blurring effects of
the atmosphere. Studies of faint objects have been hindered by the
brightness of the surrounding sky. Understanding of the sun requires
that it be studied in the ultraviolet and x-ray regions of the spectrum
and that it be studied with higher resolution than any available from
the ground. Seen from the highest mountains, not even the sun is bright

188 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

enough to provide detectable radiation below a wavelength of 2850
angstroms.

Some of these observational handicaps are being overcome by Project
Celescope. That experiment, initiated by Whipple and carried out under
the direction of Robert J. Davis, is addressed primarily to the study ol
the atmospheres of the hotter stars by means of photometric measure-
ments in those regions of the ultraviolet that are accessible only from
above the earth’s atmosphere. Named for its pioneering as a truly celes-
tial telescope, the Celescope concept originated from a series of meet-
ings in February 1958 involving the scientific staffs of Harvard College
Observatory and Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. Project Cele-
scope has been supported by the National Aeronautics and Space Admin-
istration as part of their Orbiting Astronomical Observatory (oao)
program. Other experimenters in the program are the University of

Wisconsin, Goddard Space Flight Center (csFrc), Princeton University, —

and University College in London. The program reached a climax on
7 December 1968, when nasa launched the second oAo, containing
the sao Celescope experiment as well as that of Wisconsin.

The manner chosen for accomplishing the primary mission of the
Celescope project is to conduct a sky survey, with reasonable photo-
metric accuracy, in four ultraviolet bands. One of the most important
aspects of this survey is the generation of a catalog containing ultraviolet
photometric data for the 25,000 or more stars expected to be observed.

Description and Operation of Celescope

The Celescope instrument consists of four 12.5-inch f/2 Schwarz-
schild telescopes that focus starlight on ultraviolet-sensitive television
cameras. Each telescope covers one of four separate bands of wave-
lengths centered at 2600, 2300, 1600, and 1500 angstroms. The 440-
pound optical assembly is housed in a cylinder 57 inches long and 40
inches in diameter. From this, a ten-foot cable leads to 87 pounds of
electronic gear inside a 9 x 16 x 26-inch box.

The four telescopes are identical, with the central 6.25 inches of
each 12.5-inch primary mirror obscured by its secondary. The image is
focused on the ultraviolet-sensitive surface of a special television camera
tube called a Uvicon. Although the field of view on the photocathode
is 2.8 degrees, not all of it is covered by the television raster, so the
usable field is about 2 degrees on a side. Each telescope assembly has
an additional optical system to focus light from a calibration lamp upon
the photocathode.

For the Celescope experiment, two kinds of Uvicons were specially
designed with sensitivity from 1050 to 3200 angstroms and from 1050 to
SMITHSONIAN ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY 189

2150. By means of appropriate filters, the four wavelength ranges are
achieved. Also, each field of view is divided into two halves of different
wavelength sensitivity by means of a semicircular arrangement of the
filters in front of the cathodes, thus enabling each wavelength to be
recorded on two cameras.

Although the experiment requires 54 commands to operate the elec-
tronics, no mechanical adjustments are needed in flight. The telescopes
have been designed to remain in satisfactory focus under all antici-
pated conditions. The Uvicon tubes produce single-frame pictures,
rather than a continuous “motion picture” such as is customary in com-
mercial television. To produce one such frame, 17 different commands
must be transmitted to the satellite at carefully controlled time inter-
vals. Each frame, relayed to earth by digital code, is equivalent to a scan-
ning raster of 256 lines with 256 elements in each. The reliability testing
of this system was under the direction of Yasushi Nozawa.

The Celescope experiment is operated primarily in real time, since
the command and data-storage systems on board oao 2 do not have a
large memory. Telling the spacecraft what to do is not an easy task.
Several different kinds of commands can be sent to the experiment
itself and many to the spacecraft. There are signals to control the
storage of engineering telemetry data; commands to turn on backup
subsystems should primary systems fail; commands to select analog,
digital, or stored digital modes of operation; operating instructions for
the camera whose video signal is being fed into the system; operating
controls for the voltages on each camera; and calibration commands.
The spacecraft itself can be told to connect or disconnect Celescope
power and can be given commands to store or transmit Celescope and
other data.

To convert the signals received on the ground into meaningful meas-
urements of ultraviolet flux, all optical parts have had to be carefully
calibrated—an extensive and critical undertaking.

The Celescope equipment can observe about 0.8 percent of the entire
sky per week. Since only half of the oao’s time will be used by the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory, a complete survey would
take more than four years. This is considerably longer than the expected
lifetime of either the spacecraft or the experiment. Hence, Smithsonian
scientists plan to concentrate on a set of fifty sky regions that should
provide a reasonable statistical sampling of stars.

The oao 2 satellite carries an orientation and stabilization system that
guides on stars. Its six 2-axis trackers can be set on appropriate stars as
the spacecraft is turned to observe a desired area. The experiments
on board oao 2 may never be allowed to point directly at the sun, nor
may the paddles carrying the solar-power cells turn away from the
190 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1969

sun. These constraints mean that the observing program must be care-
fully planned well in advance. This task is being performed under the
direction of William A. Deutschman.

Determination of Stellar Atmospheres

One of Celescope’s goals is the measurement of the brightnesses of at
least 25,000 main-sequence early-type stars in four spectral bands. The
datum of interest is the shape of the spectral-energy distribution curves
of the different types of stars. Only for the atmospheres of main-
sequence early-type stars do we now have a reasonably clear picture of
what to expect. As was the case with the great sky surveys of the past—
for example, the Henry Draper Catalogue and the Palomar Sky Atlas—
we plan to acquire our data by sampling the entire available portion
of the celestial sphere and thus increase our chances of making impor-
tant unexpected discoveries. We have planned our instrumentation and
observational program in order to balance the payload limitations of
Celescope with these scientific objectives.

Experiments from rockets and satellites have already given astrono-
mers a considerable amount of observational information concerning
ultraviolet stellar spectra. These observations indicate ultraviolet fluxes
that for most stars are consistent with the most recent theories of stellar
atmospheres and interstellar absorption, but interesting exceptions are
numerous.

Observation of the ultraviolet fluxes from the hot stars is of great
importance to theoretical astrophysics. One goal of Celescope is to
strengthen the observational foundation and to chart the path for
observing programs and instrumentation for future, more specialized
satellites now being planned.

Observations

As of 30 June 1969, we had scheduled 3,000 pictures in 1,000
different positions and had obtained 2,500 pictures in 900 different
positions. The reliability and performance of the Celescope experiment
in orbit have followed almost exactly the prelaunch predictions. Our
first pictures, obtained during checkout, indicated that all cameras met
or exceeded performance specifications. Three of the cameras continue
to obtain valuable scientific data, with all four wavelength bands still
in use; one camera failed after 77 days in orbit. The three cameras still
in use are exhibiting loss of sensitivity, owing partly to the effects of

space radiation on our optics and partly to the effects of prolonged
operation on the performance of the camera tubes. The present per-
formance of the equipment is such that we expect to continue receiving
useful scientific information from the Celescope experiment for several
more months.

The accompanying figure is a sample of the pictures now being
received from Celescope. The 5-second exposures show the stars in the

Sword of Orion, with the Orion Nebula surrounding Theta Orionis, |

the third bright star from the top of the picture. Since these are

extremely hot young stars, of spectral types B and O, they appear |
brighter in the shorter wavelengths (Camera 4) than in the longer —

wavelengths (Cameras 1 and 3).

The Orion Nebula is one of the brightest objects we have observed
to date. On the 60-second exposure (frame d), it is strongly over-
exposed. The bright background in the upper portion of the 60-second
exposure is hydrogen Lyman-alpha light, sunlight scattered by the earth’s
atmosphere into the otherwise dark night sky.

An early evaluation of the results indicates that very few of the
stars measured by Celescope are appreciably brighter than expected.
Although many stars lie below the normal spectrum-color relationships
predicted for the Celescope ultraviolet color system, those measurements
that we have reviewed in detail have been for the most part consistent
with a straightforward interpretation such as interstellar reddening or
known spectral peculiarities. About twenty percent of the objects found
by Celescope near the plane of the Galaxy do not appear in our identi-
fication atlas, whereas nearly every object more than 10 degrees from
the plane does. Presumably, the extra stars are mostly faint O and B
stars, but additional analysis of ground-based photographs and addi-
tional measurements using ground-based telescopes will be needed before
we can be certain.

The reduced data will be distributed, beginning early next year, as a
series of Celescope Observational Data Reports. Full interpretation of
these data must, of course, await completion of analysis for the bulk of
the observational material, since most of the scientific value of broad-
band photometric measurements such as those provided by Celescope
depends on the intercomparison of the results from measuring large
numbers of stars, rather than on the separate measurements of individual
stars.
