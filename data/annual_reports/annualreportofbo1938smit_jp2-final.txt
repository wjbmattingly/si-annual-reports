REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

C. G. ABBOT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 380, 1988

i

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN : I have the honor to submit herewith my report showing
the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and the
Government bureaus under its administrative charge during the fistal
year ended June 30, 1938. The first 15 pages contain a summary ac-
count of the affairs of the Institution, and appendixes 1 to 11 give
more detailed reports of the operations of the National Museum, the
National Gallery of Art, the National Collection of Fine Arts, the
Freer Gallery of Art, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the In-
ternational Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, the Astrophysi-
cal Observatory, the Division of Radiation and Organisms, the Smith-
sonian library, and of the publications issued under the direction of
the Institution. On page 121 is the financial report of the executive
committee of the Board of Regents.

OUTSTANDING EVENTS

The past year witnessed a further stimulus to the art feature of the
Smithsonian Institution in the passage by Congress of a resolution.
authorizing the President to designate a tract of land on the Mall for
a Smithsonian Gallery of Art and authorizing an appropriation of
$40,000 to obtain preliminary plans for such a building. It is the
expectation that the building itself will be financed by private funds.
The year also marked the completion of the foundations of the new
National Gallery of Art now under construction which is to house
the Andrew W. Mellon art collection given by Mr. Mellon to the
Nation through the Smithsonian Institution. The building is ex-
pected to be completed in 1940. The Smithsonian solar observing
station on Mount St. Katherine in Egypt was abandoned owing to the
excessive isolation of that station and other cogent reasons, and con-
struction of a new station on Burro Mountain near Tyrone in New
Mexico was begun. June 1938 marked the completion of 2 full years
of the Smithsonian radio program in cooperation with the United
States Office of Education. These educational broadcasts have con-

1
Z ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTIT UTION, 1938

tinued in favor with a very large listening audience as witnessed by
the nearly quarter of a million letters received as the result of the
program.

Among the large amount of material received by the National
Museum, an outstanding accession is a collection of mollusks obtained
through the Frances Lea Chamberlain fund which numbered well
over a million specimens. The Bureau of American Ethnology dis-
patched an expedition to South America to make extensive studies of
the Indian tribes of the western part of that continent. New ap-
paratus and new methods have been developed in the Division of
Radiation and Organisms, and investigations have yielded important
results particularly in the field of photosynthesis.

The Board of Regents lost three of its members by death, Senator
Joseph T. Robinson, Ambassador Robert W. Bingham, and Augustus
P. Loring. To fill the vacancies thus created, three new members were
appointed, namely, Senator Alben W. Barkley, of Kentucky; Dr.
Harvey N. Davis, of New Jersey; and Dr. Arthur H. Compton, of
Illinois.

SUMMARY OF THE YHAR’S ACTIVITIES OF THE BRANCHES OF THE
INSTITUTION

National Museum.—The total appropriation for the maintenance
of the Museum was $775,720, an actual increase of $11,750 over the
previous year. Specimens added to the collections, mainly as gifts
or through Smithsonian expeditions, numbered 312,729. In this
large amount of new material some of the more important accessions
were as follows: In anthropology, nearly a hundred vessels and frag-
ments from Honduras, obtained by the joint expedition with the
Peabody Museum of Harvard University, and other archeological
collections from Denmark, South Africa, and the Temple Mound in
Le Flore County, Okla.; in biology, large additions to the collec-
tions of mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, marine invertebrates, and
insects, the latter including 54,000 insects transferred from the United
States Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine; in geology,
specimens representing 62 distinct meteoric falls, largely purchased
by the Roebling Fund, 790 specimens pertaining to mineralogy and
petrology obtained through the Chamberlain Fund and the Canfield
Fund, and an unparalleled collection of Devonian invertebrates made
by Dr. G. Arthur Cooper and Preston Cloud in the Lower Peninsula
of Michigan; in arts ana industries, the first cable car to operate in
Seattle, Wash. (1889), presented by the city of Seattle, 1,500 speci-
mens pertaining to textiles, and a number of models of famous air-
planes added to the aeronautical collection; and in history, more
than 2,500 objects of historic and antiquarian value, including a num-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 3

ber of objects relating to the scientific career of Dr. Charles D. Wal-
cott, fourth Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, the gift of
Mrs. Walcott. A number of expeditions went out during the year
in the interests of the Museum’s researches in anthropology, biology,
and geology. These were financed principally by Smithsonian pri-
vate funds or by the assistance of friends of the Museum. Seventeen
special exhibitions were held during the year under the auspices of
various educational, scientific, and governmental agencies. The
number of visitors to the several Museum buildings totaled 2,408,170,
an increase of 119,638 over the previous year. The Museum pub-
lished an annual report, 5 bulletins, and 19 Proceedings separates.

National Gallery of Art—The first annual report of the National
Gallery of Art reviews the establishment of the Gallery by joint reso-
lution of Congress following the munificent gift to the Nation by the
late Andrew W. Mellon of his great collection of art works, together
with funds for the erection of a gallery building and for an endow-
ment. The trustees announced the death of Andrew W. Mellon and
S. Parker Gilbert, leaving two vacancies on the board which were
filled by the election of Paul Mellon and Ferdinand Lammot Belin
as general trustees. An organization meeting of the trustees was
held on March 9, 1938, at which bylaws were adopted and executive
officers were elected as follows: Paul Mellon, president; David K. E.
Bruce, vice president; Donald D. Shepard, secretary and treasurer;
and David E. Finley, director. Executive, acquisitions, and finance
committees were named. At the close of the fiscal year the founda-
tions of the gallery were substantially completed, and it is expected
that the building will be completed by September 1940. A list of
the paintings in the Mellon collection, now in storage at the Corcoran
Gallery of Art, is presented in the report.

National Collection of Fine Arts—The National Collection of
Fine Arts is the name used to designate the art collections adminis-
tered by the Smithsonian Institution with the exception of those
that will be included in the National Gallery of Art, now under con-
struction. A bill authorizing the Institution to obtain plans for a
building to contain these collections and to be known as the “Smith-
sonian Gallery of Art” was passed at the last session of Congress.
The bill also authorized the President to select a site for the gallery
on the Mali between Fourth and Fourteenth Streets and authorized
the soliciting of funds for its construction and for an endowment
for the purchase of works of art. The seventeenth annual meeting
of the National Gallery of Art Commission was held on December 7,
1937. As the name “National Gallery of Art” has been assigned to
the gallery building now being erected to contain the Mellon art col-
lections, the name of the Commission was changed to “Smithsonian

114728—39

2
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION » 1938

Art Commission.” A wood gravure of “Rockwell Studio,” by Ma-
cowin Tuttle, was accepted by the Commission for the collection.
Five miniatures were acquired through the Catherine Walden Myer
fund. Six special exhibitions were held as follows: The art of the
Mexican school children, 262 items; joint exhibition of the Twenty
Women Painters and the Landscape Club, of Washington, D. C.; 74
water colors by William Spencer Bagdatopoulos; 85 paintings, 20
framed and 41 unframed water colors, 34 etchings, and 33 pieces of
sculpture from the National Collection of Fine Arts; 3 portraits by
Henrique Medina; and 260 naval historical prints from the Eber-
stadt Collection.

Freer Gallery of Art.—Additions to the collections included Chinese
bronze, gold, and jade objects; Arabic manuscripts; Chinese, Indian,
and Persian paintings; Chinese porcelain; Persian pottery; and
Egyptian stone sculpture. The year’s curatorial work has been de-
voted to the study of Chinese, J apanese, Arabic, Persian, Aramaic,
and Armenian art objects and of associated texts, inscriptions, or
seals. The results of these studies have been incorporated in the
Gallery records. Many similar objects have been brought or sent to
the Director by their owners for expert opinion on their identity,
age, etc. Changes in exhibition in the Gallery have involved a total
of 75 objects. The number of visitors for the year was 120,427. Two
lectures on Musulman painting were given by Eustache de Lorey, of
Paris; 9 groups were given instruction in the study rooms, and 10
groups were given docent service in the exhibition galleries.

Bureau of American Ethnology.—Mr. Stirling, chief, besides his
administrative duties, made a reconnaissance trip to Mexico, during
which he selected a site in the Canton of Tuxtlas south of Veracruz
for archeological excavation during the coming year. Dr. Swanton
devoted most of the year to field work and investigations relating to
his work as chairman of the United States De Soto Expedition Com-
mission. Dr. Michelson undertook field work among the Montag-
nais-Naskapi Indians of the northern shore of the St. Lawrence
River and vicinity. Dr. Harrington completed a comparative study
of the Tano-Kiowan family of languages. Dr. Roberts continued his
archeological work at the Lindenmeier site in northern Colorado,
where he unearthed a large collection of specimens relating to Folsom
man, so far as known the earliest of New World inhabitants. Dr.
Steward completed his final report on the tribes of the Great Plains-
Plateau area. In April 1938, he left for Ecuador to begin extensive
ethnological studies in the western part of South America. The
Bureau published an annual report and three bulletins.

International Exchanges—The International Exchange Service
under the Smithsonian Institution acts as the official agency of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 5

United States for the interchange with other countries of govern-
mental and scientific documents. During the year the service handled
719,121 packages of such matter, an increase of 61,775 over the
previous year. The weight of these packages was 656,119 pounds.
The Government franking privilege was extended to cover a number
of South and Central American countries, and packages for those
countries were therefore sent direct to their destinations by mail in-
stead of through the respective exchange bureaus. Shipments of
exchanges to Spain have been suspended since August 1936, and those
to China since August 1937. At the close of the year, however, a large
consignment was being prepared for shipment to the Chinese Bureau
of International Exchanges, which had moved its office from Nanking
to Chungking.

National Zoological Park.—The outstanding feature of the year
was the addition to the collection of the large number of animals,
birds, and reptiles brought back by the National Geographic
Society-Smithsonian Expedition to the East Indies. The actual num-
ber of specimens was 879, consisting of 121 mammals of 46 species,
649 birds of 93 species, and 109 reptiles of 30 species. The new large
mammal house described in last year’s report was stocked with ani-
mals during August and September 1937, the difficult task of trans-
ferring such large creatures as elephants, hippopotamuses, and
rhinoceroses being accomplished without mishap. Visitors for the
year again increased in number, the total reaching 3,127,650. This
included 1,874 organizations, mainly schools, with a total of 70,371
individuals. Among the additions to the animal collection may be
mentioned 34 mammals born and 30 birds hatched in the Park. The
total number of animals in the collection at the close of the year was
2,754, an increase of 412 over last year. The most urgent need of
the Park is a new building for the restaurant and concession stand.

Astrophysical Observatory.—The main business of the year was the
recomputation of all solar-constant values from 1923 to the present
time. This immense task was nearly completed at the close of the
year, and it is hoped that by January 1939 a homogeneous series of
daily values will be available. A highly sensitive instrument to
measure the distribution of energy in the spectra of some of the
brighter stars was constructed by Dr. Abbot and Mr. Hoover, and in
May 1938 Mr. Hoover took the apparatus to Mount Wilson, Calif.,
to make new measurements of the stellar spectrum energy and also
to make studies of the growth of plants in monochromatic rays. By
way of anticipating next year’s report, it may be said that gratifying
progress was made in both researches. At the request of the Weather
Bureau, construction was begun of a duplicate of the atmospheric
turbidity and moisture apparatus used by the Institution in testing
6 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

the desirability of mountain sites for solar observatories. Dr. Abbot
made further progress in the development of devices for utilizing
solar radiation. The solar-radiation station on Mount St. Katherine
in Egypt was abandoned for several reasons in December 1937 , and a
new station was located on Burro Mountain near Tyrone, N. Mex. It
is hoped to begin observations there by November 1938. Dr. Brian
O’Brien, aided by Smithsonian grants, has made further progress in
the development of methods and apparatus for measuring solar varia-
tion in the ultraviolet from sounding balloons, and he hopes soon
to be able to compare this method with the results of the Smithsonian
solar-constant observations.

Division of Radiation and Organisms.—Many investigations relat-
ing to plant growth and radiation have been fruitfully pursued dur-
ing the year. An improved method has been developed for measur-
ing plant growth substances concerned in the bending of plants
toward the light. Several members of the staff have collaborated in
preparing a new automatic apparatus for measuring and recording
photosynthesis continuously, as well as an apparatus for the deter-
mination of chlorophyll. Preparations are under way for the investi-
gation of photosynthesis in algae. Studies were continued of mixtures
of artificial lights suitable to promote satisfactory plant growth under
laboratory conditions. Dependence of the induction periods in the
photosynthesis of wheat on the length of previous dark exposures was
further investigated, and in addition important results were obtained
on the chlorophyll—CO, ratio during photosynthesis. Members of the
staff published five papers on the results of these and other investiga-
tions during the year.

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of
England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States
of America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith.
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
cnowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting the
trust, Congress determined that the Federal Government was without
authority to administer the trust directly, and, therefore, constituted
an “establishment” whose statutory members are “the President, the
Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive
departments.”

THE BOARD OF REGENTS
During the year the Board of Regents lost three of its members

by death, namely, Senator J oseph T. Robinson, of Arkansas, on July
14,1937; Ambassador Robert W. Bingham, of Kentucky, on December
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 7

18, 1937; and Mr. Augustus P. Loring, of Massachusetts, on March
17, 1938. Senator Alben W. Barkley, of Kentucky, was appointed
by the President of the Senate on November 15, 1937, to succeed
Senator Robinson; by joint resolution of Congress approved June
15, 1988, Dr. Harvey N. Davis, of New Jersey, was appointed to suc-
ceed Ambassador Bingham; and by joint resolution approved June
90, 1988, Dr. Arthur H. Compton, of Illinois, was appointed to suc-
ceed Mr. Loring. Also by joint resolution approved June 20, 1938,
Hon. R. Walton Moore, of Virginia, was reappointed to succeed
himself.

The roll of Regents at the close of the year was as follows: Charles
Evans Hughes, Chief Justice of the United States, Chancellor; John
N. Garner, Vice President of the United States; members from the
Senate—M. M. Logan, Charles L. McNary, Alben W. Barkley; mem-
bers from the House of Representatives—T. Alan Goldsborough,
Charles L. Gifford, Clarence Cannon; citizen members—Frederic A.
Delano, Washington, D. C.; John C. Merriam, Washington, D. C.;
R. Walton Moore, Virginia; Roland 8. Morris, Pennsylvania; Harvey
N. Davis, New Jersey; Arthur H. Compton, Tllinois.

Proceedings—The annual meeting of the Board of Regents was
held on January 18, 1938. The Regents present were Chief Justice
Charles Evans Hughes, Chancellor; John N. Garner, Vice President
of the United States; Senators M. M. Logan and Alben W. Barkley;
Representatives T. Alan Goldsborough, Charles L. Gifford, and
Clarence Cannon; citizen Regents Frederic A. Delano and John C.
Merriam; and the Secretary, Dr. Charles G. Abbot.

The Secretary presented his annual report, detailing the activities
of the several Government branches and of the parent institution
during the year, and Mr. Delano presented the report of the execu-
tive committee, covering financial statistics of the Institution. The
Secretary also presented the annual report of the National Gallery
of Art Commission, the name of which was changed, by a resolution
adopted by the Regents at this meeting, to the Smithsonian Art
Commission.

In his usual special report the Secretary presented to the Regents
a brief review of important activities carried on by the Institution
and members of the staff during the year.

In addition to the annual meeting, there was a special meeting
of the Board of Regents on May 11, 1938, at which the following
Regents were present: Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes, Chan-
cellor; Representatives T. Alan Goldsborough, Charles L. Gifford,
and Clarence Cannon; citizen Regents Frederic A. Delano, R. Walton
Moore, and Roland S. Morris; and the Secretary, Dr. Charles G.
Abbot. This meeting was called to consider several urgent matters
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN IN STITUTION, 1938

that had arisen, including a pending joint resolution of Congress
(which was afterward approved on May 17, 1938) setting apart public
ground for the Smithsonian Gallery of Art, and establishing the
Smithsonian Gallery of Art Commission, to make preliminary in-
vestigations and to secure appropriate designs, by competition or
otherwise, for a Smithsonian Gallery of Art. The joint resolution
also authorized an appropriation of $40,000 for expenses of the Com-
mission, which amount was included in the deficiency appropriation
bill approved June 25, 1938.

MATTERS OF GENERAL INTEREST

THE SMITHSONIAN GALLERY OF ART

In my last report I spoke of a resolution introduced at the first
session of the Seventy-fifth Congress to establish a Smithsonian Gal-
lery of Art to house the national art collections. The resolution did
not pass that session of Congress, but it was introduced again at the
third session, passed both houses of Congress, and was approved by
the President on May 17, 1938. The resolution authorized the Presi-
dent to set apart ground for such a gallery on the Mall between
Fourth and Fourteenth Streets and Constitution and Independence
Avenues. A commission was set up, to be called the Smithsonian
Gallery of Art Commission, who were authorized to secure appropri-
ate designs for a gallery building, and $40,000 was authorized to be
appropriated for this purpose. The Regents of the Institution were
authorized to solicit and receive subscriptions of funds for the con-
struction of a building. In addition to providing space for the
present National Collection of Fine Arts, administered by the Insti-
tution, and other art works belonging to the Government, the Smith-
sonian Gallery of Art is authorized by the resolution to hold public
exhibitions, to acquire and sell contemporary works of art, to employ
artists and other personnel, and to award scholarships.

The $40,000 authorized to be appropriated was actually provided
in the Second Deficiency Act approved June 25, 1938.

The Smithsonian Gallery of Art Commission as designated in the
resolution held its first meeting on May 25, 1938, at the Smithsonian
Institution. Five of the eight members constituting the Commis-
sion were present, namely, Edward Bruce, Frederic A. Delano, Hon.
Kent E. Keller, Charles L. Borie, Jr., and Dr. Charles G. Abbot.
Two of the remaining members, Senators Alben W. Barkley and
Gilmore D. Clarke, were unable to be present, and the eighth mem-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9

ber, a representative of the Board of Regents of the Institution, had
not yet been designated. Mr. Delano was elected chairman of the
Commission and Dr. Abbot secretary. A ways and means committee
was appointed to consider the matter of soliciting funds from pro-
spective donors for the construction of the gallery building, and an
outline of the characteristics of a desirable type of building was
presented by the chairman. The meeting adjourned subject to call
by the chairman.

The Smithsonian Institution is indeed gratified that at last there
is real promise of a suitable gallery building to house the valuable
art collections in its custody formerly known as the National Gallery
of Art and since 1937 as the National Collection of Fine Arts. Such
a gallery, together with the National Gallery of Art now under
construction and the Freer Gallery of Art, all associated with the
Smithsonian Institution, will undoubtedly go far toward placing
America among the forefront of nations in the field of art and will
eventually make of the Nation’s Capital an art center comparable
with those of the Old World.

SMITHSONIAN RADIO PROGRAM

In June 1938 was completed the second full year of “The World
is Yours,” the weekly radio program put on the air by cooperation
between the United States Office of Education, the National Broad-
casting Co., and the Smithsonian Institution, with the financial sup-
port of the Works Progress Administration. The series was begun
in June 1936 as an experiment in the field of educational radio. The
Smithsonian editorial office worked out a widely diversified but
carefully balanced series of subjects in the various fields of the
Institution’s activities—science, invention, history, and art—and these
subjects were presented to listeners as half-hour dramatizations every
Sunday over an NBC network. The number of stations carrying the
programs was small at first, but increased gradually until in June
1938 “The World is Yours” went on the air over 57 stations and 2
short-wave stations.

In my last report were listed the subjects covered in the first year’s
programs. From July 1, 1937, to June 30, 1938, the following
subjects were presented :

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 11

According to the large amount of mail received at the Office of
Education after each week’s program goes on the air, the series has
maintained a widespread popularity among listeners of all ages and
occupations in the United States, Canada, and some foreign coun-
tries. During the two years “The World is Yours” has been on the
air, close to a quarter of a million letters have been received, only
a very small fraction of 1 percent of which have contained adverse
criticism. Many, on the other hand, have been enthusiastic in their
praise of the efforts of the Smithsonian and the Office of Education
to make available via radio the wealth of information in science,
history, and art contained in the exhibits and laboratories of the
Smithsonian Institution.

Again I wish to express the Institution’s gratitude to the Office
of Education, the National Broadcasting Company, and the W. P. A.
for making this educational radio program possible. It supple-
ments admirably the Institution’s previous methods of accomplishing
one of its primary functions, the diffusion of knowledge. The finan-
cial support of the W. P. A. now seems assured for the continuation
of the program during the coming fiscal year.

WALTER RATHBONE BACON TRAVELING SCHOLARSHIP

The Walter Rathbone Bacon Traveling Scholarship of the Smith-
sonian Institution was awarded for a third consecutive year com-
mencing June 15, 1937, to Dr. Richard E. Blackwelder.

At the beginning of the period Dr. Blackwelder spent about 6
weeks in England where he studied the West Indian collections of
Staphylinidae belonging to the British Museum and to Dr. Malcolm
Cameron. Upon his return to this country he prepared his final
report which takes the form of a revision of the West Indian com-
ponents of the beetle family Staphylinidae.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION EXHIBIT AT THE PARIS INTERNATIONAL
EXPOSITION, 1937

In order to conform to the general theme of the Paris International
Exposition, that is, “Arts and Technique of Modern Life,” the Smith-
sonian Institution selected as its contribution a small exhibit which
aimed to show the technique and variety of media originally used by
the North American Indian for his artistic expressions. it was entitled
“Arts and Crafts of the North American Indian.” The exhibit
formed one of a series of Federal exhibits occupying a portion of the
United States Building in the Exposition grounds.

The exhibit consisted of 41 carefully selected specimens from the
vast ethnological collections of the United States National Museum.
They included examples indicative of the Indians’ skill in wood and
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

stone carving; skin dressing; appiication of vegetable dyes; basket
weaving; embroidery work with split and died porcupine quills and
with glass beads; sewed feather designs; and free-hand painting of
decorative and symbolic designs. The craftsmanship of some 15
American Indian tribes was represented in the exhibit including the
Comanche, Sioux, Cheyenne, Shoshone, Poma, Apache, Chippewa,
and Kiowa.

The exhibit was arranged in two exhibition cases especially designed
for the purpose, and with each object there were placed brief descrip-
tive labels in both English and French.

SEVENTH ARTHUR LECTURE

The seventh Arthur lecture, The Sun and the Atmosphere, was
given by Dr. Harlan True Stetson, of the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, in the auditorium of the National Museum on the evening
of February 24, 1938. Dr. Stetson, one of the world’s leading authori-
ties on the solar-terrestrial relationship, discussed particularly the sun-
spots and their effect upon various terrestrial matters. The lecture
is published in the General Appendix to the present report (p. 149).

The Arthur lecture was provided for in the will of the late James
Arthur, of New York City, who left to the Institution in 1931 a sum
of money, part of the income from which should be used for an
annual lecture on some aspect of the study of the sun.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

Twenty-four expeditions during the last calendar year took Smith-
sonian representatives to 13 States in the United States and many
foreign countries to collect specimens and data needed in the scientific
researches of the Institution.

Dr. Charles W. Gilmore directed exploration for dinosaur and nam.
malian fossils in Utah and Arizona. Dr. Charles E. Resser studied
the Cambrian rocks of New York, Vermont, and Quebec. Dr. G.
Arthur Cooper collected fossils needed in current investigations in
Michigan, Pennsylvania, New York, and Canada. E. P. Henderson,
representing the Smithsonian at the International Geological Con-
gress in Moscow, had an opportunity to study the minerals of Russia.

Dr. Alexander Wetmore visited Venezuela to observe the bird life
of that part of South America. A collection of birds, including the
very rare Asiatic fin foot and the Malayan ring plover, was made by
H. G. Deignan in Siam. Gerrit S. Miller, Jr., spent 3 months in
Panama collecting animals and plants. Watson M. Perrygo, con-
tinuing the work begun last year, went to Tennessee to obtain bird
and mammal specimens needed for the Museum collections. Dr.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 13

William M. Mann directed the National Geographic Society-Smith-
sonian Expedition to the East Indies to collect living animals, birds,
and reptiles for the National Zoological Park. William N. Beach
obtained in Alaska some fine specimens of moose and caribou for
the National Museum’s exhibition series. Capt. Robert A. Bartlett,
who for several years has been carrying on investigations in the
Arctic region, visited the west coast of Greenland, sending back to
the Smithsonian many specimens of marine life as well as speci-
mens of birds and plants. Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt participated
in an expedition to the West Indies and obtained, in addition to many
new marine forms, two porpoises, which are among the rarest things
in museums. Dr. Paul Bartsch took part in an expedition for the
collection of marine organisms in West Indian waters. Dr. Bartsch
also continued his heredity experiments, begun in 1912, using young
specimens of a species of fresh-water mollusk as his subjects and
various rivers and creeks in Virginia and West Virginia as breeding
grounds. Dr. Edward A. Chapin collected some 50,000 specimens of
insects on the Island of Jamaica, among them three species of scarabs
new to science. Austin H. Clark hunted the “invisible butterfly,” the
Brazilian skipper, in Virginia, and although he was unable to find
one of these butterflies, he obtained specimens of other rare species.
Paul S. Conger explored the lakes of northern Wisconsin for diatoms.

Dr. Ale’ Hrdlitka went again to Alaska to further his study of the
earliest occupation of that region, and spent 3 months on a series of
the Aleutian Islands and on the Commander Islands, collecting 51
boxes and barrels of important anthropological material. Dr. Her-
bert W. Krieger conducted an archeological expedition to explore a
large shell mound on the Island of Anegada, the most northerly of the
British Virgin Islands, the objective being a comparison of the Indian
relics recovered there with the large collection obtained by previous
Smithsonian expeditions to the West Indies. Waldo R. Wedel in-
augurated an archeological survey of Kansas, spending 314 months
in reconnaissance excavations in the northeastern part of the State
and unearthing a wealth of important and varied archeological
remains. David I. Bushnell, Jr., visited ancient Indian sites on the
banks of the Rappahannock in Virginia and recovered many cul-
tural objects shedding light on the manners and ways of life of the
early inhabitants of the valley. Dr. John R. Swanton engaged in two
field trips for the purpose of tracing De Soto’s trail across America
to the Mississippi. Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., obtained addi-
tional evidence at the Lindenmeier site in Colorado of the existence
of Folsom man, one of the earliest known inhabitants of the New
World. Dr. Truman Michelson spent the summer of 1937 among the
Montagnais-Naskapi Indians in Canada for the purpose of complet-
14. ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

ing a linguistic map showing the distribution and interrelations of
the Cree and the Montagnais-Naskapi dialects.

PUBLICATIONS

The Institution and its branches issued during the year a total of
68 publications. Of this number, 38 were issued by the Smithsonian
proper, 26 by the National Museum, and 4 by the Bureau of American
Ethnology. The titles, authors, and other information regarding all
these publications will be found in the report of the editor, appendix
11. The total number of copies of publications distributed was 129,478.

The Institution depends in large part upon its series of publications
to carry out one of its primary functions—the diffusion of knowl-
edge. Its other means—its museum and art gallery exhibits, its ex-
tensive correspondence, its science news releases, and educational radio
programs—are also important, but in its publications are presented in
permanent form the results of researches by the scientific staffs of the
Institution, the National Museum, the Bureau of American Ethnology,
and other branches. These publications are regularly distributed free
to a large list of libraries and educational institutions, where they are
readily available to students and to other scientific workers.

Among the larger publications of the year there may be mentioned
as particularly outstanding a work by Henry B. Collins, Jr., entitled
“Archeology of St. Lawrence Island, Alaska,” in which he summarizes
the results of several years’ work in the far north on the prehistory
of the Eskimo; “Preliminary Report on the Smithsonian Tnstitution-
Harvard University Archeological Expedition to Northwestern Hon-
duras, 1936,” by William Duncan Strong, Alfred Kidder IJ, and A. J.
Drexel! Paul, Jr.; “The Oxystomatous and Allied Crabs of America,”
by Mary J. Rathbun, another in her series of monographs on Ameri-
can crabs; and “Historical and Ethnographical Material on the Jivaro
Indians,” by M. W. Stirling, an account of the Jivaro head-hunters of
Ecuador based on first-hand information obtained by Mr. Stirling on
a recent expedition to the region occupied by these Indians.

LIBRARY

Accessions to the Smithsonian library for the year numbered 10,892
items, received mostly through exchange and gift. These bring the
total number of items in the library to 887 414, exclusive of thousands
of volumes incomplete or unbound. The outstanding gift of the year
was a collection of 1,186 volumes and pamphlets on the history and
culture of China, presented by Mrs. William Woodville Rockhill. The
Geophysical Laboratory presented 3,312 miscellaneous publications,
the American Association for the Advancement of Science, 653; and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

the American Association of Museums, 209. Besides the extensive
exchange work, which involved 25,264 packages of publications, the
staff of the library recorded 23,992 periodicals, cataloged 6,449 publi-
cations, prepared and filed 42,568 catalog and shelf list cards, made
11,880 loans, and did a considerable amount of work on the union
catalog. The chief need of the library is more funds for binding.
Respectfully submitted.
C. G. Aszor, Secretary.
APPENDIX 1
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the condi-
tion and operation of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1938:

Funds provided for the maintenance of the National Museum for
the year totaled $775,720, representing an increase of $20,250 over
the previous year. Owing to a compulsory administrative deduc-
tion of $8,500, however, this increase actually amounted only to
$11,750.

COLLECTIONS

Material added to the Museum collections during the year came
in 1,713 separate accessions totaling 312,729 specimens. These addi-
tions were mostly gifts from individuals or represented expeditions
sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution. The specimens were dis-
tributed among the five departments as follows: Anthropology, 2,162;
biology, 244,761; geology, 60,927; arts and industries, 2,297; and his-
tory, 2,582. All the accessions are listed in detail in the full report
on the Museum, printed as a separate document, but the more
important are summarized as follows:

Anthropology.—Archeological accessions of importance included
nearly one hundred vessels and fragments from Honduras, obtained
by the 1936 joint expedition with the Peabody Museum of Harvard
University; a lot of Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age objects
from Denmark; Neolithic stone implements from South Africa; and
a collection of artifacts from the Temple Mound in Le Flore County,
Okla.

As in previous years, C. C. Roberts donated many articles of eth-
nological interest from West Africa. Various objects came from the
Eskimo in Alaska and the Hudson Bay region. Navaho, Pueblo,
and Ojibwa blankets, beadwork, pottery, and baskets came from sev-
eral donors. Seventy-eight ceramic specimens were received, 10 musi-
cal instruments, and 57 objects representing period art and textiles.

In the division of physical anthropology 555 specimens, including
much skeletal material, were received. Of these, 291 were obtained
by Dr. AleS Hrdlicka in Alaska during his field explorations; 144
from an Indian site in Stafford County, Va., were donated by the

17
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

late Judge W. J. Graham; and 67 from another important Indian
site at Accokeek, Md., were presented by Mrs. A. L. L. Ferguson.
Biology.—Biological specimens added during the year numbered
over 240,000, and the total in this department now exceeds 12,500,000.
Of the mammals received, more than 1,200 were transferred from the
United States Biological Survey. A particularly welcome gift was
that of a mounted specimen of a Montana grizzly bear of a form now
extinct (true Ursus horribilis) from Dr. C. Hart Merriam. A fine lot
of cetacean material also was received. Important avian accessions
included birds collected in Venezuela by Dr. Alexander Wetmore,
in Siam by H. G. Deignan, in Tennessee by W. M. Perrygo, and in
China by Dr. D. C. Graham. New reptile and amphibian material
came from many places, notably reptiles from the Lesser Antilles,
Siam, Ceram, and Sumatra, Tennessee, Florida, Texas, Maine, and
Vermont; frogs and toads from Brazil; and salamanders from Central
America. About 5,100 fishes were transferred to the Museum collec-
tion from the United States Bureau of Fisheries; 12,780 specimens
from the middle Atlantic coast were presented by the Bingham
Oceanographic Foundation of Yale University and the United
States Bureau of Fisheries; the Carnegie Institution of Washington
gave 6,200 fishes collected by the late Dr. W. H. Longley from the
Tortugas and the Dutch West Indies; and many hundreds of others
came from the National Geographic-Smithsonian Expedition in
Sumatra, the Smithsonian-Hartford Expedition of 1937, the Tennes-
see Valley Authority, the United States Biological Survey, the Bass
Biological Laboratory, and H. G. Deignan, to name but a few of the
many donors. The more important accessions of insects include the
following: The Blackmore collection of Lepidoptera (2,111 speci-
mens), the Quirsfeld collection of weevils (1,157 specimens), 15,000
ants donated by Dr. M. R. Smith, 10,000 Chinese insects collected by
Dr. D. C. Graham, and 54,000 insects transferred from the United
States Bureau of Entomology and Plant Quarantine. The 15,300
marine invertebrates added consisted mostly of specimens new to the
collections or type material. Over 1,000 specimens of marine in-
vertebrates were added through the explorations of Capt. Robert A.
Bartlett, in West Greenland in 1937, and another large group from
the West Indies resulted from the Smithsonian-Hartford Expedition.
The outstanding accession of mollusks was the Bohumil Shimek col-
lection of loess shells, obtained through the Frances Lea Chamberlain
Fund. This collection, of both recent and fossil species, consisted of
nearly 25,000 lots and aggregated more than a million individual
specimens. About 36,500 plants were added to the herbarium collec-
tions, from many points of North, South, and Central America.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 19

Geology—Important accessions in mineralogy were made possible
by several Smithsonian funds. Through the Canfield fund were pur-
chased minerals from Japan, Sardinia, Rumania, Greece, Austria,
California, Arkansas, Arizona, and Montana; through the Roebling
fund, seven American diamonds; and through the Chamberlain
fund, four cut gem stones. In all, 790 specimens pertaining to min-
eralogy and petrology were received. Seventy meteorite specimens,
many purchased by the Roebling Fund, representing 62 falls new
to the collection, were added during the year, the largest number since
the acquisition of the Shepard collection in 1915.

In the field of vertebrate paleontology, the collections benefited es-
pecially by the field expedition of C. W. Gilmore, and by material
presented by the United States Texas Centennial Commission. In all,
69 fossil vertebrates were added, including the partial skeleton of a
very large sauropod dinosaur of the family Titanosauridae, the first
to be found in North America.

Chiefly through the efforts of members of the staff, about 60,000
specimens were added to the collections in stratigraphic paleontology,
the most extensive and valuable accession of the year in this field
being an unparalleled collection of Devonian invertebrates made by
Dr. G. Arthur Cooper and Preston Cloud in the Lower Peninsula of
Michigan. Others came from the Chazyan rocks of northeastern New
York and Quebec. Rare brachiopods were obtained from Canada and
Nevada, and Devonian corals and crinoids from Michigan. Transfers
from the United States Geological Survey included collections in
Ozarkian, Canadian, and Chazyan brachiopods, numbering more
than 22,000 specimens.

Arts and industries—Models of the following airplanes were
added to the aeronautical collections: The Vickers Vimy plane that
made the first nonstop trans-Atlantic flight in 1919; the Sikorsky
S—40, the first of the clipper planes on airways over Florida, the West
Indies, and South America; the Wilford gyro; the low-wing tractor
monoplane Mohawk made for Col. Charles A. Lindbergh; and sev-
eral historic airmail planes, including the Queen Bleriot (1911), the
Curtiss modified “R” (1916), and the Northrop airplane that held
the 1934 record for transcontinental mail transport. The first cable
car to operate in Seattle, Wash. (1889), was presented to the Museum
by the City of Seattle. Several interesting original builders’ models
of watercraft also were received. Many miscellaneous objects per-
taining to communication, metrology, refrigeration, photography,
and tools and crafts continued to come in as gifts and loans, wel-
come additions to these sections, and nearly 1,500 specimens pertain-
ing to textiles, organic chemistry, wood technology. and medicine
were received during the year. To the graphic arts display were

11472839 3
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

added 821 specimens showing printing processes (in 8 exhibition
cases) received from the United States Government Printing Office.

History.—More than 2,500 objects of historic and antiquarian value
were received, chiefly portraits, costumes, medals, mementos, and fur-
niture of historic characters. The series of awards and personal
mementos was enriched by a number of objects relating to the scien-
tific career of Dr. Charles D. Walcott, fourth Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution, a gift of Mrs. Walcott. Several pieces of parlor
furniture made in Paris for President James Monroe in 1817 and
used in the White House from then until 1937 were lent to the Mu-
seum by the White House for an indefinite period. The numismatic
collection was increased by 366 coins and medals, including a bronze
medal commemorating the invention of the bifocal lens by Benjamin
Franklin in 1784. The philatelic collection was increased by the
transfer from the Post Office Department of 2,088 specimens of
foreign postage stamps, cards, and envelopes.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

The scientific explorations of the year by members of the Museum
staff were financed principally by grants from the private funds of
the Smithsonian Institution or by contributions from friends of the
Institution. The investigations were varied in nature and brought
highly important results in additions to scientific knowledge and in
contributions of specimens to the national collections.

In May, Dr. Alexander Wetmore, Assistant Secretary, as repre-
sentative of the Smithsonian Institution, and chairman of the official
delegation of the United States, was in attendance at the Ninth In-
ternational Ornithological Congress, held in Rouen, France. At the
close of the meetings it was voted to hold the next Congress, which
will come in 1942, in the United States. Dr. Wetmore was then
elected President. Following the meetings he visited museums and
laboratories in Switzerland, particularly in Bern and Basel, and later
worked at the British Museum (Natural History) in London.

Anthropology—During April and May 1938 Frank M. Setzler,
head curator of the department of anthropology, continued an arche-
ological program in the trans-Pecos area of southwestern Texas.
Since 1931 Mr. Setzler has been attempting, as opportunity per-
mitted, to outline the aboriginal culture status of the cave dwellers
in the Big Bend region of Texas. His previous excavations at the
mouth of the Pecos contributed largely to knowledge of the unusual
physical types of this simple nonpottery-making horizon. This year,
through the L. L. Wilson fund, he was enabled to excavate a large
cave in the northeast corner of Terrell County. Though this pro-
duced no skeletal material, the 9-foot deposits of burnt rocks and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 21

ashes contained sufficient aboriginal artifacts to show a direct cul-
tural relationship with regions to the south and west in the Chisos
Mountains and near Alpine. After examining additional material
from the Guadelupe Mountains, in the Carlsbad Archeological and
Historical Society Museum, and a small collection from caves around
Albuquerque, N. Mex., Mr. Setzler concludes that this prehistoric
phase has a much wider distribution than heretofore recognized, espe-
cially in the eastern part of New Mexico. The exact period of occu-
pation of these caves can only be surmised; but since no evidence of
Kuropean materials has been reported in association with the san-
dals, baskets, and other artifacts, he concludes that the caves were
abandoned before any of the early Spanish explorers visited the area.
Since most of their material culture comprises baskets instead of
earthenware vessels, they may have become isolated before the manu-
facture of aboriginal pottery became so widespread and indispensa-
ble among the prehistoric inhabitants in either the Southwest or the
Mississippi Valley. The chronological relationship, if any exists,
between the Big Bend Cave Dwellers and the Basketmaker phase in
northern New Mexico and Arizona as yet remains unsolved.

On October 14, Herbert W. Krieger, curator of ethnology, sailed
from New York for Charlotte Amalie, St. Thomas, to conduct arclie-
ological investigations in the Virgin Islands under a grant from the
Smithsonian Institution. The expedition was undertaken as a result
of information conveyed by Robert Nichols, superintendent of agri-
culture of St. Thomas, to the effect that a large shell mound existed
on the Island of Anegada, the northernmost of the British Virgin
Islands. The immediate objective was an exploration of the Anegada
mound, which required the cooperation of the United States Coast
Guard Service. A survey of the shell mound led to the conclusion
that the culture represented was similar to that of other nonpottery-
producing cultures discovered on previous Smithsonian expeditions to
the Dominican Republic, Haiti, and Cuba. At the conclusion of the
Anegada survey a trial excavation was made of the Indian midden
east of Road Town on the Island of Tortola. Later, excavations
were carried out in considerable detail on the A. S. Fairchild prop-
erty at Magens Bay on the Island of St. Thomas, and later at Ackles
on United States Government property on the Island of St. Croix.

These investigations led to the discovery of three distinct cultures,
all of which may be of Arawak origin—the shell culture on the Ane-
gada site, the early Arawak culture type of the Road Town site and
to a certain extent of the Magens Bay area, and the late Arawak cul-
ture of the Ackles site. An overlapping of the Arawak I and Ara-
wak II phases was strikingly illustrated in the excavations at Magens
Bay. A chronology of West Indian aboriginal cultures has conse-
quently assumed form. The sequence of the three main culture types
yy ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

just indicated permits of the dovetailing as subcultures for Arawak I
(early Arawak) and for Arawak II (late Arawak) of the material
from certain sites in the Dominican Republic and Haiti excavated by
former Smithsonian expeditions from 1928 to 1931. It is quite clear
that the shell middens of the caves of the south shore of Samand Bay
(Smithsonian expedition, 1928) and of the Ile 4 Vache shell midden
(Smithsonian expedition, 1931) are-culturally related to the Anegada
shell midden. The expedition to the Virgin Islands thus has crystal-
lized tentative conclusions with regard to the classification of West
Indian culture sequences based on numerous investigated sites.

Dr. AleS Hrdlitka, curator of physical anthropology, assisted by
six students, spent the greater part of June, July, and August,
1937, in archeological investigations on the Aleutian Islands. After
reaching the Aleutian Islands the party received permission to work
in the Commander Islands in Soviet territory, but because of un-
foreseen circumstances the visit had to be very short. Although
there was little time for scientific work, enough information was
gained to encourage the arrangement for another visit. The Insti-
tution in its northern work is once more deeply indebted to the
United States Coast Guard for its excellent cooperation, which made
possible the work not only in the Aleutian Islands but in the Com-
mander group. In 1938, again through the cooperation of the United
States Coast Guard, archeological work was continued in the
Aleutian Chain and was well under way at the close of the fiscal
year.

From the beginning of the fiscal year until September 13, 1937,
Dr. Waldo R. Wedel, assistant curator of archeology, was occupied
in an archeological survey in Kansas, beginning a long-term program
that is planned to cover a complete survey of the entire State in
an attempt to establish the outlines of the aboriginal Indian cultures
throughout that region. It should also reveal answers to some of
the puzzling problems relating to prehistoric cultures in the Missis-
sippi Valley and in the Western Plains. By using early documentary
accounts some of the historic Indian sites can be definitely identified,
and thereby they may reveal a complex of material culture traits that
can be identified with their prehistoric antecedents. Dr. Wedel’s
investigations of 1937 included excavations at three village sites
along the bluffs of the Missouri River and above Kansas City, and
two in the Kansas River Valley near Manhattan. In the prolific site
on Line Creek, northwest of Kansas City, evidences were found of
an extended occupation of prehistoric origin containing two di-
agnostic types of earthenware vessels. One type has a general cord-
roughened decoration, while directly associated with it was a superior
ware bearing decorations closely comparable to the Hopewellian type
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY ya

of the Mississippi Valley and never before reported as far west as
Kansas City. An early Kansa Indian Village was also investigated
near the old river town of Doniphan, Kans. This village was visited
by early explorers in 1724 and again by Lewis and Clark in 1804. A
few miles below the mouth of the Blue River a circular house site
was excavated in an old Kansa village visited and described by
Major Long’s expedition in 1819. Dr. Wedel again resumed his
explorations in Kansas on May 11, 1938, and was in the field at the
close of the fiscal year.

Since Judge W. J. Graham’s death on November 10, 1937, ar-
rangements have been made for Dr. T. Dale Stewart, assistant cura-
tor of physical anthropology, to take over the excavations on an
Indian site at Potomac Creek, Va., and to advance the work from
the point reached by Judge Graham. During the latter part of the
fiscal year Dr. Stewart made several visits to the site for preliminary
surveys.

Biology.—Through the friendly cooperation of William N. Beach
and J. Watson Webb, the National Museum has secured a valuable
collection of large mammals from the Rainy Pass region beyond
Mount McKinley in Alaska. In preparation for this work pack
horses under charge of Harry Boyden were sent to Alaska in June.
Mr. Beach and Mr. Webb, accompanied by W. L. Brown, chief
taxidermist of the National Museum, arrived at McKinley Park
Station on the Alaska Railroad on the evening of August 13 and
continued through the park to join the pack outfit on the McKinley
River. Work in this field continued until the middle of September
and resulted in obtaining fine material for a habitat group of moose,
which will be mounted for exhibition. The largest bull moose se-
cured has a fine heavy set of horns with a spread of 65 inches. In
addition, the party obtained caribou and other mammals much needed
for the National Museum.

In continuation of work begun last year in West Virginia, Watson
M. Perrygo, scientific aid, made collections of birds and mammals
in Tennessee to obtain needed material for the National Museum.
Mr. Perrygo left for the field early in April, accompanied by Carle-
ton Lingebach as assistant, and began work in the Mississippi bot-
toms near Memphis. Work continued around Reelfoot Lake, on
the Cumberland Plateau, and in the high mountains along the
western border of the State, terminating on July 15 for the summer.
In mid-September the party left for the field again, Mr. Lingebach
being replaced by Henry R. Schaefer. The first collections were
made on Roan Mountain, one of the highest mountains in the East-
ern United States, with a summer temperature reputed to be the
coldest for the entire Southeast in the summer season. Following
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

this, collections were made in the Clinch Mountains, and then the
party again visited the area about Reelfoot Lake to follow the fall
migration in that region. After further investigations in the cen-
tral and southern part of the State, they returned to Washington
the middle of November. The excellent collections of birds and
mammals secured will form the basis of reports similar to those pre-
pared for the work in West Virginia of last year. The work was
carried on under the W. L. Abbott fund.

During October and November Dr. Alexander Wetmore, Assistant
Secretary, traveled in northwestern Venezuela to make studies of the
birds through arrangements perfected under the friendly cooperation
of the American Minister, the Hon. Meredith Nicholson, and the
gracious assistance of Dr. E. Gil Borges, Ministro de Relaciones
Exteriores of Venezuela. In this work a survey was made of the
bird life along a line extending from Ocumare de la Costa on the sea
coast through the mountain range of the Cordillera de la Costa to
Maracay and from there to the northern Llanos, in the vicinity of
El Sombrero. In addition to securing an important collection of
specimens, Dr. Wetmore made many observations on birds in life.

Capt. Robert A. Bartlett again visited the western coast of Green-
land during the summer of 1937 on his schooner Morrissey and se-
cured important gatherings of marine animals that were presented
to the National Museum. Collections were made from Cape York
north by way of Northumberland and Hakluyt Island, to Smith
Sound.

Dr. D. C. Graham continued his collecting work in western China,
forwarding many specimens of insects and of birds and other verte-
brates.

Geology.—Dr. Charles E. Resser, curator of stratigraphic paleon-
tology, studied Cambrian rocks on the flanks of the Adirondack
Mountains in New York and Vermont and along the St. Lawrence
River in Quebec, making investigations in Pennsylvania en route. In
addition to collecting invertebrate fossils he was occupied in check-
ing the relations of the various strata examined in connection with
his work in the laboratory.

Dr. G. Arthur Cooper, assistant curator of stratigraphic paleon-
tology, accompanied by P. E. Cloud, returned early in the year from
a month’s investigations of the Devonian of Michigan. In the latter
half of September Dr. Cooper and Dr. Josiah Bridge visited the
Champlain Valley to study the Chazyan rocks, both trips yielding
excellent fossils. Dr. Cooper made a third trip in August, in company
with Dr. Bradford Willard, of the Pennsylvania Topographic and
Geologic Survey, to study the Tully formation along the Allegheny
Front and from Lock Haven to the Schuylkill Valley.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 95

E. P. Henderson was abroad from early in May until October
1937. Two months were occupied in attendance at the Seventeenth
International Geological Congress at Moscow, in visiting important
museums, and in collecting minerals in the Kola Peninsula and the
Ural Mountains. The remaining time was occupied in Ceylon study-
ing the gem deposits of that island, and in Japan in visiting minera-
logical institutions and dealers from whom interesting specimens
were obtained. Important mineralogical and geological collections
were made, but the more important results are the contacts and ex-
changes, either made or initiated, by which a large quantity of
Russian, Norwegian, Swedish, Scottish, and Japanese material will
be received.

As the field expedition of 1937 under C. W. Gilmore, curator of
vertebrate paleontology, extended well into the present fiscal year,
but brief mention was made of it in last year’s report. This expe-
dition in the Upper Cretaceous of the North Horn area in central
Utah, and in the Triassic of the Petrified Forest region of Arizona,
met with most gratifying results. The Utah area was a virgin field
so far as professional collecting was concerned, and the results ob-
tained fully justified the venture. A good beginning was made in
the development of a fauna for the North Horn formation of the
Upper Cretaceous, and a small collection of mammalian remains
indicated for the first time the presence of Paleocene strata in this
geologic section. The finding of a large sauropod dinosaur skeleton
in association with Upper Cretaceous dinosaur remains is a discov-
ery of much interest and fully establishes the fact that this group
of reptiles in North America lived into the Upper Cretaceous. Most
of the specimens obtained are new to science. From the Triassic of
Arizona important phytosaurian and amphibian remains were col-
lected that go far in filling gaps in our permanent collections. The
collections obtained filled 18 large cases having a combined weight
of nearly 3 tons. George F. Sternberg, as in previous seasons, ren-
dered efficient assistance, and George B. Pearce ably assisted as
field assistant.

In May, Dr. C. L. Gazin, assistant curator of vertebrate paleon-
tology, left Washington to head an expedition that will continue the
explorations in central Utah so auspiciously begun last season. This
will be followed by work in the Upper Eocene deposits of the Uinta
Basin.

MISCELLANEOUS

Visitors —Since the year 1932-83, when a low point was reached
presumably as a result of unfavorable economic conditions, the num-
ber of visitors to the various Museum buildings has steadily mounted.
26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

This year there were 119,638 more visitors than last, bringing the
total up to 2,408,170, which is our greatest annual attendance to date.
The attendance in the four Museum buildings was recorded as fol-
lows: Smithsonian Building, 371,770; Arts and Industries Building,
1,094,254; Natural History Building, 750,307; Aircraft Building,
191,839.

Publications and. printing—The sum of $21,000 was available dur-
ing the year for the publication of the Museum annual report, bul-
letins, and Proceedings. Twenty-six publications were issued—the
annual report, 1 volume of Proceedings completed, 5 bulletins, and
19 separate Proceedings papers. These aggregated 1,640 octavo pages
and 242 plates, an increase of 36 pages and 107 plates over last year.
The five bulletins issued were as follows: No. 100, volume 6, part 9,
The Tree Snails of the Genus Cochlostyla of Mincoro Province,
Philippine Islands, by Dr. Paul Bartsch; No. 166, The Oxystomatous
and Allied Crabs of America, by Dr. Mary J. Rathbun; No. 168,
Nearctic Collembola, or Springtails, of the Family Isotomidae, by
the late Dr. Justus W. Folsom; No. 169, The Fort Union of the Crazy
Mountain Field, Montana, and Its Mammalian Fauna, by Dr. George
Gaylord Simpson; and No. 171, The Pleistocene Vertebrate Fauna
from Cumberland Cave, Maryland, by the late Dr. James W. Gidley
and Dr. C. Lewis Gazin.

Volumes and separates distributed during the year to libraries and
individuals throughout the world aggregated 57,761.

Assistance from work relief agencies—The Works Progress Ad-
ministration of the District of Columbia continued the assignment of
relief workers to Museum offices, and during the course of the year
the number of such workers increased from 88 to 167. The work
performed totaled 130,205 man-hours, and embraced such tasks as
checking, labeling, and repairing library material; preparing draw-
ings and photographs; typing notes and records; model making and
repair; preparing, mounting, cataloging, numbering, and checking
specimens; labeling and drafting; translating; and assisting with
plaster casts.

Special exhibitions—Seventeen special exhibitions were held dur-
ing the year under the auspices of various educational, scientific, and
governmental agencies. The division of graphic arts featured 17
special exhibits—8 in graphic arts and 9 in photography.

CHANGES IN ORGANIZATION AND STAFF

During the year there were few changes in the scientific staff. In
the Department of Anthropology, Frank M. Setzler was appointed
head curator on July 1, 1937, and Harry B. Collins, Jr., was advanced
to associate curator, Division of Ethnology, on February 17, 1938. In
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 27

the Department of Biology, Dr. Leonard P. Schultz was made curator
of the Division of Fishes on January 16, 1938, and H. Harold Shamel
was advanced to senior scientific aid in the Division of Mammals on
September 3, 1937. In the Department of Geology, Bertel O. Reber-
holt, by reallocation was advanced to senior scientific aid in the Di-
vision of Physical and Chemical Geology, November 1, 19387. Wil-
liam E. Moran was appointed junior scientific aid in the Division of
Vertebrate Paleontology on June 16, 1938. In the Department of
Arts and Industries, Kenneth M. Perry was appointed assistant ex-
hibits worker in the Division of Mechanical Technology, on October
16, 1937.

On January 1, 1938, Norman H. Boss, chief preparator, Division
of Invertebrate Paleontology, returned to duty from detail to the
Greater Texas and Pan American Exposition at Dallas, where he was
assigned as exhibit supervisor for the Smithsonian Institution.

The Museum lost through death during the year four employees:
Arthur J. Poole, scientific aid in the Division of Mammals, on July
8, 1937, after 22 years 7 months of service; Daniel Clark, skilled
laborer, on August 23, 1937, after 28 years of service; Jacob Willy,
lieutenant of guard, on January 25, 1938, with 16 years of service;
and William Robinson, laborer, on May 14, 1938, with 20 years of
service. From the honorary staff the Museum lost through death
Dr. Maurice C. Hall, honorary custodian of helminthological col-
lections, on May 2, 1938.

APPENDIX 2
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Sm: Pursuant to the provisions of section 5 (b) of Public Resolu-
tion No. 14, Seventy-fifth Congress, approved March 24, 1937, I
have the honor, on behalf of the trustees of the National Gallery
of Art, to submit the first annual report of the Board, covering the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1938, on its operations under the afore-
mentioned joint resolution.

Under the joint resolution of Congress it appropriated to the
Smithsonian Institution the area bounded by Seventh Street, Con-
stitution Avenue, Fourth Street and North Mall Drive (now Madison
Drive) Northwest, in the District of Columbia, as a site for a
National Gallery of Art; authorized the Smithsonian Institution to
permit The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, a pub-
lic, religious, educational, and charitable trust, established by the late
Hon. Andrew W. Mellon, of Pittsburgh, Pa., to construct thereon a
building to be designated the “National Gallery of Art”; and created,
in the Smithsonian Institution, a bureau to be directed by a board
to be known as the “Trustees of the National Gallery of Art,”
charged with the maintenance and administration of the National
Gallery of Art. This act provides that the board be comprised of
the Chief Justice of the United States, the Secretary of State, the
Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, ex-officio, and five general trustees. The general trustees
first taking office were to be chosen by the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution; and their successors are to be chosen by
the majority vote of the general trustees.

On June 24, 1937, the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution appointed the following as general trustees of the National
Gallery of Art:

Donald D. Shepard, for the term expiring July 1, 1939;
S. Parker Gilbert, for the term expiring July 1, 1941;
Duncan Phillips, for the term expiring July 1, 1948;
David K. E. Bruce, for the term expiring July 1, 1945;
Andrew W. Mellon, for the term expiring July 1, 1947.

The Trustees deeply regret to report that Andrew W. Mellon, the
donor of the great art collection which has been deeded to the Gallery

29
30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

as well as the funds for the erection of the the gallery building to
house the collection, died on August 26, 1937; also that S. Parker
Gilbert, one of the original general trustees, died on February 28,
1938. On March 9, 1938, the three surviving general trustees, at a
meeting duly held at Washington, D. C., elected Paul Mellon to
serve the unexpired term of his father, the late Andrew W. Mellon,
and Ferdinand Lammot Belin was elected to serve the unexpired
term of the late S. Parker Gilbert.

On March 9, 1938, an organization meeting of the Trustees was
held in the Regents Room of the Smithsonian Institution and, after
full consideration by the Trustees, a draft of bylaws submitted at
the meeting was adopted as the bylaws of the Trustees of the
National Gallery of Art.

The bylaws provide that the executive officers shall consist of the
chairman of the Board, president, vice president, secretary, treas-
urer, director, administrator, assistant director, chief curator, and
such other executive officers as the Board shall determine. The
Chief Justice of the United States, ex-officio, is the chairman of the
Board.

At this meeting it was determined that the regular annual meet-
ing of the Board shall be held on the second Monday in February of
each year, at 9:30 a. m.

Also the Trustees elected the following executive officers:

Paul Mellon, president ;

David K. E. Bruce, vice president ;
Donald D. Shepard, secretary;
Donald D. Shepard, treasurer ;
David H. Finley, director.

The officers elected stated they would serve without compensation
for the time being. It was decided by the Trustees that the matter
of their later compensation, if any, should be considered at a subse-
quent meeting of the Board. The following Trustees were elected
as members of the three standing committees, provided for in the
bylaws:

EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

Chief Justice of the United States;
Dr. C. G. Abbot;

Paul Mellon;

David K. BE. Bruce;

Donald D. Shepard.

ACQUISITIONS COMMITTEE

Paul Mellon;

David K. B. Bruce;
David EH. Finley ;

Duncan Phillips;
Ferdinand Lammot Belin.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY sent

FINANCE COMMITTE®

Hon. Henry Morgenthau, Jr.;
Hon. Cordell Hull;

Paul Mellon ;

David K. E. Bruce;
Ferdinand Lammot Belin.

Appropriate resolutions were passed relating to the reproduction
by photographs, or otherwise, of works of art controlled by the
Board, the use of such reproductions, the viewing and care of the
collection. The Board directed the treasurer, under the supervision
and subject to the approval of the finance committee, to cause to be
established an appropriate accounting system, including provisions
for the keeping of necessary books and records, so that the works
of art now under the control of the Board and all funds, securities,
and works of art and other properties of whatsoever character belong-
ing to or under the control of the Board and of such additions and
receipts thereto and disposition, withdrawals and disbursements
therefrom, may be properly recorded.

Under the trust indenture of June 24, 1937, between the Trustees
of The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, the Smith-
sonian Institution, and the Trustees of the National Gallery of Art,
the Smithsonian Institution received title to the works of art given
by The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust, upon the
understanding that pending completion of the Gallery, the donor
would retain custody of the gift, at its expense, and that upon
delivery, the gift would form part of the permanent collection in
the custody of the Trustees of the National Gallery of Art. Pur-
suant to its offer, accepted by the Trustees of the National Gallery
of Art at its meeting on March 9, 1938, The A. W. Mellon Educa-
tional and Charitable Trust has defrayed the current administrative
expenses of the Gallery, as well as the expense of storage and the
care of the collection pending the completion of the National Gallery
of Art. During the 18 months ended June 30, 1938, the total of such
administrative expenses and expenses of storage amounted to about
$150,000 principally accounted for by insurance premiums on policies
expiring in 1940. The collection is now stored in the Corcoran
Gallery of Art. The collection is in excellent condition and is being
well protected and cared for. The current expenses for the custody
of the collection are at the rate of approximately $12,000 per annum.
Such expenses are being paid by The A. W. Mellon Educational and
Charitable Trust and, of course, are not recorded on the books of
account of the National Gallery of Art.

Pursuant to the joint resolution and the trust indenture of June
24, 1937, The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust is
also proceeding, at its expense, with the construction of the National
32 - ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

Gallery of Art on the site set aside for it by the Congress. At June
30, 1988, $1,796,147.29 had been expended upon construction, and
the foundations of the Gallery were substantially completed. We
are advised that if no unusual delay, occasioned by conditions be-
yond the contractor’s control, is encountered, the Gallery will be
completed by September 1940, and sufficient Gallery rooms will be
available for the display of the works of art by November 1940.
We are advised that the Trustees of The A. W. Mellon Educational
and Charitable Trust estimate that the total cost of the building
will exceed $15,000,000. Recording of such expenditures in the books
of account of the National Gallery of Art will be deferred until
completion of the construction of the Gallery.

Section 4 (b) of the joint resolution authorizes the Trustees to
accept and administer gifts of money or securities. In a letter dated
February 16, 1937, from the late Hon. A. W. Mellon to Hon. Kent
KE. Keller, chairman of the Committee on the Library of the House
of Representatives, Mr. Mellon stated that the endowment fund for
the Gallery, as proposed in his letter to the President of the United
States, had been fixed at an amount of $5,000,000. It is understood
that this fund is expected to be received by the Trustees of the Na-
tional Gallery of Art from the Trustees of The A. W. Mellon Edu-
cational and Charitable Trust, at or about the time of the com-
pletion of the National Gallery of Art.

There were no additions to the collection of the National Gallery
of Art during the year. However, the Gallery has received a number
of offers of gifts of works of art. Such offers were referred to the
acquisitions committee for consideration. Also there were no loans
of works of art under the control of the Trustees of the Gallery
during the year. No appropriation was made by Congress for the
National Gallery of Art during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1938,
and no public or private funds received or disbursed during the
year.

Pursuant to instructions, Price, Waterhouse & Co., a nationally
known firm of public accountants, has made an examination of the
accounting records of the National Gallery of Art, the accounting
system having been installed upon the recommendation of that firm.
Price, Waterhouse & Co. report that, based upon its examination,
the books of account of the National Gallery of Art fairly present,
in accordance with the accepted principles of accounting, the posi-
tion of the National Gallery of Art at June 30, 1938. Copy of the
certificate of Price, Waterhouse & Co., dated August 26, 1938, is
attached hereto and made a part of this report. It should be noted
that the only entry on the books of account of the National Gallery
of Art, as of June 30, 1938, was the opening journal entry of June
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 33

94, 1937, recording its acquisition of the collection of works of art,
there being no other transactions to June 30, 1938, which should be
recorded in the books of account. The gift of June 24, 1937, was
recorded on the books of account at $31,303,162.31, representing, ac-
cording to available information, the cost to the last person to ac-
quire the works of art by purchase. Of this amount $19,893,162.31
represented purchases of works of art by the late Hon. Andrew W.
Mellon, and $11,410,000 represented purchases by The A. W. Mellon
Educational and Charitable Trust. A list of the works of art which
were the subject of the gift of June 24, 1937, is attached to this report.
The certificate of Price, Waterhouse & Co. states that the receipt of
title to this gift was recorded properly in the Gallery’s books by the
opening journal entry.
The certificate of Price, Waterhouse & Co. follows:

AucusT 26, 1938.
Mr. Donatp D. SHEPARD,
Treasurer, National Gallery of Art,
716 Jackson Place NW., Washington, D. C.

Dear Siz: Pursuant to your instructions, we have made an examination of
the accounting records of the National Gallery of Art and other documentary
evidence, and have obtained information and explanations from its officers.
The only entry in its books of account as at June 30, 1938, was the opening
journal entry dated June 24, 1937, recording its acquisition of works of art;
our examination disclosed no other transactions to June 30, 1938, which should
be recorded in the books of account.

Pursuant to joint resolution of Congress, approved March 24, 1937, and trust
indenture dated June 24, 1937, The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable
Trust, at its expense, is proceeding with construction of the National Gallery
of Art. The recording of such expenditures in the books of account of the
National Gallery of Art is deferred until completion of construction.

By the aforementioned trust indenture title was acquired to the works of art
given by The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust. Pending con-
struction of the Gallery, these works of art remain in the custody of the donor
to be cared for at its expense. This gift was recorded in the books of account
at $31,303,162.31, representing, according to available information, the cost to
the last person to acquire the works of art by purchase. Of this amount,
$19,893,162.31 represented purchases by Mr. A. W. Mellon and $11,410,000.00
represented purchases by The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust.
The receipt of title to this gift was recorded properly in the Gallery’s books
by the opening journal entry previously referred to.

An endowment fund of $5,000,000 is expected to be received from The A. W.
Mellon Hducational and Charitable Trust at about the time of completion of
the Gallery.

In our opinion, based upon our examination, the books of account fairly
present, in accordance with accepted principles of accounting, the position of
the National Gallery of Art at June 30, 1938.

Yours very truly,
(Signed) Prick, WATERHOUSE & Co.

APPENDIX 3
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL COLLECTION OF FINE ARTS

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activ-
ities of the National Collection of Fine Arts for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1938:

The name “National Collection of Fine Arts,” which has now
been in existence for a year and a quarter, is perhaps still not well
understood. I wish to call attention, therefore, to the fact that the
National Collection of Fine Arts is the name now used to designate
the art collections administered by the Smithsonian Institution, with
the exception of those which The Andrew W. Mellon Charitable and
Educational Foundation will place in the building now under con-
struction which will be known as the “National Gallery of Art.”

Congress, late in the last session, passed a bill authorizing the
Smithsonian Institution to obtain plans for a building to be known
as the “Smithsonian Gallery of Art,” and authorizing the President
to select a site for it on the Mall between Fourth and Fourteenth
Streets. This new building will house the art collections under the
charge of the Smithsonian Institution which are not to be in the
National Gallery of Art. The bill also authorized the soliciting of
funds for the construction of the Smithsonian Gallery of Art, and for
an endowment to be used in purchasing works of art.

There were 484 visitors to the main office during the year. Many
submitted art objects for examination and identification, and others
sought general information.

APPROPRIATIONS

For the administration of the National Collection of Fine Arts by
the Smithsonian Institution, including compensation of necessary
employees, purchase of books of reference and periodicals, traveling
expenses, uniforms for guards, and necessary incidental expenses,
$34,275 was appropriated. This amount was reduced $750, bringing
it to $33,525, of which $16,542 was expended for the care and mainte-
nance of the Freer Gallery of Art, a unit of the National Collection
of Fine Arts. The balance of $16,983 was spent for the care and
upkeep of the National Collection of Fine Arts, nearly all of this sum
being required for the payment of salaries, traveling expenses, books,
periodicals, and other necessary disbursements for the care of the col-

37
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

lections, so that only a very small sum was available for improvements
in the exhibition halls.

THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART COMMISSION

The seventeenth annual meeting of the National Gallery of Art
Commission was held on December 7, 1937. The members met at
10:30 at the rooms of the National Collection of Fine Arts, in the
Natural History Building, where, as the advisory committee on the
acceptance of works of art which had been submitted during the
year, they accepted the following:

A wood gravure of “Rockwell Studio,” by Macowin Tuttle. Gift of Mrs. Mary
H. Lathrop, Rockford, Tl.

The members then proceeded to the Smithsonian Building, where
the annual meeting was called to order by the chairman, Mr. Borie.
The members present were: Charles L. Borie, Jr., chairman; Frank
Jewett Mather, Jr., vice chairman; Dr. Charles G. Abbot (ex officio),
secretary; and Herbert Adams, Gifford Beal, George H. Edgell,
James E. Fraser, John E. Lodge, Paul Manship, George B. Mc-
Clellan, Edward W. Redfield, and Mahonri M. Young. Ruel P.
Tolman, curator of the Division of Graphic Arts in the United States
National Museum and acting director of the National Collection of
Fine Arts, was also present.

The following resolutions on the death of Mr. Andrew W. Mellon
were submitted and adopted, and Secretary Abbot was requested
to convey a copy to Mr. Mellon’s family:

Whereas the National Gallery of Art Commission has learned of the death,
on August 26, 1987, of Andrew W. Mellon, a member of this Commission since
1934; therefore be it

Resolved, That the Commission records its sincere sorrow at the passing of
Mr. Mellon, who devoted many years of his long life to assembling an excep-
tionally fine collection of paintings and sculpture. With patriotic generosity
he gave in 1937 this outstanding collection of masterpieces to the Smithsonian
Institution for the United States with the hope that Washington would become
the art center of the world. At the same time he provided funds for a monu-
mental marble building to be known as the National Gallery of Art, and
arranged for an endowment, proposed to be $5,000,000. No other gift of art
has ever equalled this one.

Mr. Mellon had a deep interest also in the great building program of the
Government, and did much, as Secretary of the Treasury, to promote it. Al-
though he lived to a great age, the Commission deeply deplores the untimely
death of Mr. Mellon before he could see and enjoy the full fruition of his work
and his beneficence.

Resolved, That these resolutions be spread upon the records of the Commission
and that the Secretary be requested to convey a copy to the family of Mr.
Mellon.

The Commission recommended to the Board of Regents the name
of David E. Finley to fill the vacancy caused by the death of Mr.

Mellon.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 39

It also recommended to the Board of Regents the reelection for
the succeeding term of 4 years of the following members: Charles L.
Borie, Jr., Frederick P. Keppel, George B. McClellan, and Mahonri
Young.

The following officers were reelected for the ensuing year: Charles
L. Borie, Jr., chairman; Frank Jewett Mather, Jr., vice chairman;
and Dr. Charles G. Abbot, secretary; as well as the members of the
executive committee—Charles Moore, Herbert Adams, and George
B. McClellan (Charles L. Borie, Jr., as chairman of the Commission,
and Dr. Charles G. Abbot, as secretary of the Commission, are ex-
officio members of the executive committee).

The advisability of recommending to the Board of Regents a change
in the name of the Commission was considered and the following
minute was agreed upon:

Owing to the appropriation of the name “National Gallery of Art” to the
gallery being erected to contain the gift of Mr. Mellon, the Commission recom-
mends to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution that its name
be changed from “National Gallery of Art Commission” to “Smithsonian Gallery
of Art Commission.” *

The question of a building for the Smithsonian Gallery of Art, to
contain the National Collection of Fine Arts, and of a site for such a
gallery, was discussed, and Dr. Abbot, Messrs. Borie, McClellan,
Moore, and Keppel (with the addition of Mr. Edgell in case Mr.
Keppel was not available) were appointed to consider the two pend-
ing Congressional resolutions on this subject (S. J. Res. 99, by Senator
Walsh, and H. J. Res. 280, by Representative Keller).

It was decided that future annual meetings should be held on the
first Tuesday in December of each year.

THE CATHERINE WALDEN MYER FUND

Five miniatures were acquired from the fund established through
the bequest of the late Catherine Walden Myer, as follows:

“Portrait of Henry Trescot,” painted in 1822 by Charles Fraser

“Portrait of Elizabeth Knapp,” by James Peale, 1802; from H. D.

“Portrait of Dr. George Ackerly,” by Henry Inman (1801-1846) ;
from Mrs. Josephine C. Gager, Washington, D. C.

“Portrait of Napoleon III,” signed “F. de Fournier, Paris, 52;”
from Miss Marion Lane, Washington, D. C.

1The Board of Regents, after careful consideration, decided that the name should be
“Smithsonian Art Commission.”

APPENDIX 5
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1938, conducted
in accordance with the act of Congress of June 28, 1937. The act
referred to contains the following item:

American ethnology: For continuing ethnological researches among the Amer-
ican Indians and the natives of Hawaii, the excavation and preservation of
archeologic remains under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, in-
cluding necessary employees, the preparation of manuscripts, drawings, and
illustrations, the purchase of books and periodicals, and traveling expenses,
$58,730.

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

During the greater part of the fiscal year, M. W. Stirling, Chief
of the Bureau, was in Washington engaged in administrative duties
and in preparation of various publications.

From the latter part of January until the middle of March, 1938,
Mr. Stirling was in Mexico examining archeological sites and museum
collections. A site in the Canton of the Tuxtlas south of Veracruz
was selected for excavation during the winter of 1938-39.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnol-
ogist, was engaged in the preparation of the final report of his re-
searches in the interests of the United States De Soto Expedition
Commission, of which he is chairman. One field expedition was
undertaken in connection with this research. It was directed in
the first instance to the southern part of Clarke County, Alabama, at
the invitation of James Y. Brame, Jr., of Montgomery, an indefat-
igable student of the route of De Soto, who hoped that he had dis-
covered the site of the old town of Mabila, where occurred a notable
battle between the Spaniards and Indians on October 18, 1540. The
site in question, at a place called Lower James Hammock, on the
bluff above Choctaw Lake, proved to be an interesting one and
specimens of certain novelty types of pottery were obtained, but the
question as to its identity with Mabila is still in doubt, the evidence
being rather negative. After this work was finished an attempt was
made to locate other Indian town sites in the southeastern part of the
county, but, aside from a very small one previously identified by Mr.

49
50 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

Brame, nothing was found, there being, in fact, a singular dearth
of Indian remains in this county in the section where it would be
natural to look for Mabila. In the southwestern part of the county,
however, there is a spot to which the Indians resorted for salt, one
noted on early French maps, and here a considerable collection of
potsherds was made and a number of pictures of the site taken.
While Dr. Swanton was engaged in this investigation, the Choctaw
Hunting and Fishing Club kindly extended the use of its camp at
Choctaw Bluff.

After returning to Montgomery, Dr. Swanton proceeded to Tus-
caloosa and David De Jarnette, assistant to Prof. Walter S. Jones,
took him to Scottsboro and afterward on a number of trips along
the part of the Tennessee River valley believed to have been traversed
by De Soto. It seems to be indicated rather clearly that the Span-
iards crossed and recrossed this several times. Before returning to
Washington Dr. Swanton attended a meeting on October 29-80 called
by the De Soto Committee of the Society of the Colonial Dames of
America in preparation for a celebration of the quadricentennial of
the passage of the Mississippi by De Soto, and he delivered an
address at one of the sessions.

Dr. Swanton has also added some further material to his large
paper on the Indians of the Southeast.

In December he presided as vice-president over several sessions
of Section H, American Association for the Advancement of Science,
at Indianapolis.

In March he was appointed to the United States Board on Geo-
graphical Names to occupy the place made vacant by the death of
J. N. B. Hewitt, and he attended the twelfth annual meeting on
May 23.

Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist, left Washington early in July
1987 to undertake field work among the Montagnais-Naskapi Indians
of the northern shore of the St. Lawrence River and vicinity. This
work was made possible through a generous grant-in-aid made by
the American Council of Learned Societies. He arrived at Natash-
quan July 12 and spent 18 days there, following which he continued
his investigations at Seven Islands, Moisie, and Bersimis. Owing to
the migratory habits of the Indians Dr. Michelson was able to get
data not only on Indians of the localities named but also others in
this region, including Mingan, St. Margeret’s River, Godbout, Shel-
terbay, and Sheldrake. He was also able to check up his previous
information on the Indians of Davis Inlet, far north on the Labra-
dor coast; and by good fortune came in contact with an Indian of a
band from the northeast corner of Lake Kaniapiskau—a band barely
known to the scientific world. The principal object was to complete
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 51

a map showing the distribution and interrelations of the Cree and
Montagnais-Naskapi dialects. In addition to the linguistic work
which was the primary purpose of the trip, many new ethnological
data were obtained, together with certain observations in physical
anthropology. The remainder of the year was spent in Washing-
ton in the preparation of manuscripts and in routine work.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Dr. John P. Harrington, eth-
nologist, finished a comparative study of the Tano-Kiowan family
of languages, a compact body of dialects which have inherited the
same phonetics, grammatical peculiarities, and vocabulary, although
the Tanoan branch is typically Pueblo in culture while the Kiowa
branch is equally typical of the Western Plains culture. No lin-
guistic study shows better how habitat has produced two cultures by
migration from a linguistic nucleus which had perhaps originally a
third culture—possibly like that of the Flatheads of the northern
Rockies, from which region the linguistic progenitors of both Ta-
noans and Kiowans apparently came. The Tano-Kiowan situation,
however, is clearer than the surprisingly similar Athapascan situa-
tion, since there is historic information on the northern origin of
the Kiowa, whereas the migration of any body of southern Athapas-
cans from the north still remains theoretical. It is established that
both the Tanoans and the southern Athapascans of the southwest-
ern United States are of comparatively recent northern origin, at
least as far as their language-transmitting ancestors are concerned.

Returning to the study of the Devils Tower, which has a bearing
on the Tano-Kiowan provenience problem, Dr. Harrington was
assisted materially by Newell F. Joyner, custodian of the Devils
Tower National Monument, Devils Tower, Wyo., who supplied a mass
of material, including maps and other data. If the Kiowans came
from the somewhat far north, it is certain that their linguistic
relatives, the Tanoans, did also.

Working by similar methods, Dr. Harrington also made a study
of the Athapascan peoples. Here we have a northern linguistic
nucleus still extant, not of the past but of the present, and a family
of languages more intimately associated with the problem of the
original entry of man from Siberia into America, since if we exclude
the somewhat aloof-standing Eskimo, all the territory of America
nearest Asia is occupied by the Athapascan and related Tlingit
tongues.

Following up Goddard’s discovery that the Kiowa-Apache-Lipan-
Jicarilla form a separate language group, having shifted over-
aspirated fa to kh, that is, the # having assimilated the ¢ to its
articulatory position, Thomas’ recent work on the Prairie Apaches
was found of interest. A considerable list of the Prairie Apaches are

114728—39-—-5
52 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

known to us by name through the old Spanish historical documents of
New Mexico, showing that the 4A language was spoken by many tribes
which covered a large area of the High Plains. The northernmost
of these tribes is reported in old Spanish sources from what is now
northeastern Colorado, only 150 miles south of the Black Hills. This
takes away the element of novelty from the fact that the Kiowa-
Apache joined the Kiowa in the Black Hills region about the year
1800 or earlier, and shows that the Kiowa-Apache also were merely
one of the kh speaking tribes, typically Prairie Apaches, and not an
Athapascan people en route migrating from Canada, as Goddard at
first conjectured. A report was finished on the northern provenience
of the Navaho and Apache.

Considerable time was also spent on a new sign language study,
through Kiowa informants and other sources, bringing out addi-
tional information regarding the nature and structure of this inter-
esting Plains Indian invention.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr.,
archeologist, was conducting excavations at the Lindenmeier Site
north of Fort Collins, Colo. This was a continuation of the pro-
gram of investigations started in the fall of 1934 and carried on
during succeeding summers. The location is one where Folsom
man, one of the earliest known New World inhabitants, camped
and made the weapons and tools that were used in killing and
dressing the big game that constituted his main source of sustenance.
Work was resumed in 1937 at the point where the 1936 activities
terminated and at the end of the summer an area of some 2,800 square
feet had been uncovered and numerous traces of occupation noted
and studied. Several places were found where bison and other large
animals had been dismembered, cooking fires lighted, and a feast
enjoyed. At other places there were indications that individuals had
been seated there manufacturing stone projectile points, knives, and
scrapers. Many charts were drawn recording the nature of the
assemblages of bones and stone implements and showing their distri-
bution. In addition, 133 diagrams illustrating the character of the
overlying deposits were prepared as the excavations progressed.
These, together with the extensive notes on the work, add valuable
data to the body of information on the mode of life and customs
of the people. A collection of 735 specimens was obtained and
among them were several new forms of knives, scrapers, and points.
These broaden the knowledge relative to the general complex and
nature of the material culture.

At the close of the excavating season Dr. Roberts proceeded to
North Platte, Nebr., where he inspected a number of collections be-
longing to local residents and visited the sites where many of them
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 53

were found. Through the interest of R. R. Langford, of North
Platte, he was able to see a number of locations where Folsom-type
objects have been found and add to the series of notes that is being
kept on the subject of Folsom distribution. From North Platte Dr.
Roberts returned to Washington.

The winter and spring months were devoted to office duties. These
included the study of the material obtained during the summer’s
excavations and the revision and completion for publication of a
manuscript on archeological work done in the Whitewater District
in eastern Arizona. Besides completely revising the text of this re-
port, 15 additional plans and diagrams were drawn to augment those
already prepared. This manuscript was turned over to the editor and
is to appear as Bulletin 121 of the Bureau of American Ethnology.
With the permission of the Chief of the Bureau and the Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution, several short manuscripts were pre-
pared for publication in anthropological journals and other profes-
sional papers.

Dr. Roberts left Washington on June 7, 1938, for Fort Collins,
Colo., and again resumed excavations at the Lindenmeier Site. At
the close of the fiscal year the diggings had been reopened and a num-
ber of specimens obtained. These included several pieces of bone that
bear evidence of attempts at engraving designs on them and give
some indications of a certain amount of artistic effort on the part of
Folsom men.

Dr. J. H. Steward, ethnologist, remained in Washington during
the greater part of the fiscal year and completed his final report
on the tribes of the Great Basin-Plateau area. This was submitted
to the editor and will appear as Bulletin 120 of the Bureau. In
anticipation of an extended expedition to South America, Dr. Stew-
ard spent considerable time in making preparations for his projected
ethnological studies in the western part of South America. On April
20 he left Washington for Ecuador in order to begin this work. The
end of the fiscal year found him still in Ecuador working among the
highland Indians.

EDITORIAL WORK AND PUBLICATIONS

The editing of the publications of the Bureau was continued
through the year by Stanley Searles, editor.

BULLETINS ISSUED DURING THE YEAR

115. Journal of Rudolph Friederich Kurz, edited by J. N. B. Hewitt.

116. Ancient Caves of the Great Salt Lake Region, by Julian H. Steward.

117. Historical and Ethnographical Material on the Jivaro Indians, by M.
W. Stirling.
54 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

RELEASED FOR PUBLICATION

118. An Archaeological Survey of the Norris Basin in Hastern Tennessee, by
Maj. William S. Webb.

The index of Schoolcraft’s Indian Tribes has been almost com-
pleted.

Work has been done on other manuscripts in the custody of the
editor.

Publications distributed totaled 16,569.

LIBRARY

There has been no change in the library staff. Accessions during
the fiscal year totaled 395.

Eight new exchanges were added during the year, three of these
being large, important sets, one domestic and two foreign.

Library of Congress cards have been obtained for practically all
of the new material received as well as for some older items. Analyti-
cal entries have been made for all periodical items in the Bureau’s
field received since April 1936. The depository set of Library of
Congress catalog cards is now installed in working order and has
proved to be a great help to the staff as well as to those in the library.

The librarian attended the meetings of the Inter-American Bib-
liographical and Historical Association in February 1938, and made
arrangements to exchange cards for South and Central American
Indian languages and folk-lore entries with Dr. Boggs, of the Uni-
versity of North Carolina.

There were shipped abroad 2,639 boxes, an increase of 19 over the
preceding year. Of these boxes, 538 were for depositories of full
sets of United States governmental documents, and the remainder
(2,101) were for distribution to miscellaneous establishments and
individuals. There were transmitted by mail 111,475 packages, an
increase over last year of 24,179.

For a number of years the government franking privilege has been
in existence between the United States and Canada, Cuba, Mexico,
Newfoundland, and Panama, and exchange packages for these coun-
tries, therefore, have been sent direct to their destinations by mail
and not through the exchange bureaus in the respective countries.
In recent months this privilege has been extended. The complete
list of the countries with which this privilege is now in effect is as

follows: Canada, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Cuba, Dominican
Republic, Ecuador, Guatemala, Haiti, Honduras, Mexico, Newfound-
land (including Labrador), Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru,
Salvador, Uruguay, and Venezuela. _

Shipments of exchanges to Spain, owing to the disturbed political
conditions in that country, have been suspended since August 1936.

Owing to the war in China, consignments to that country were
suspended in August 1937. The Chinese Bureau of International
Exchange, having moved its office from Nanking to Chungking, re-
quested the Institution to forward shipments to its new address, and
at the close of the year a large consignment was being prepared for
transmission to that bureau.

Packages for the National Library of Peiping, the Engineering
Reference Library, Nanking, and the Library Association of China,
instead of being included with the regular consignments to the new
address of the Chinese Exchange Bureau, are being forwarded to
Hong Kong in care of the Fung Ping Shan Chinese Library, at the
request of Dr. T. L. Yuan, who is officially connected with those
organizations.

FOREIGN DEPCSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

There are forwarded to foreign depositories 111 sets of United
States official publications, 61 being full sets and 50, partial sets.
The depository of the full set sent to Chile has been changed from
Biblioteca del Congreso to Biblioteca Nacional, Santiago; the de-
pository in Mexico, from Biblioteca Nacional to Departamento Aut6-
nomo de Publicidad y Propaganda, Mexico; and the depository in
the Soviet Republic, from State Central Book Chamber to All-Union
Lenin Library, Moscow.

APPENDIX 7
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the oper-
ations of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1938.

The regular appropriation made by Congress for the maintenance
of the Park was $225,000, all of which was expended.

IMPROVEMENTS

The stone large-mammal house, which had been completed in the
previous fiscal year, was stocked with animals during August and
September 1937, and was opened to the public October 13, 1937,
at the same time the giraffes, tapirs, African buffaloes, and
gaurs that had been obtained on the National Geographic-Smith-
sonian Expedition were moved into it. This building was described
and pictured in the last annual report.

W. P. A. work ceased on January 27, 1937, and was not resumed
until September 1937. From this date until the close of the fiscal
year W. P. A. workers were engaged mainly in cutting down the
hill between the new large-mammal house and the refreshment stand,
and in the construction of a stone retaining wall around the base
of the hill. This work had not been completed at the close of the
fiscal year. In addition, they demolished the octagonal elephant
house—the first building ever constructed in the Zoo—which had
been vacated when the elephants were moved to the new large-mam-
mal house, and they also demolished the brick elephant house in
accordance with the plans developed when the small-mammal house
was placed immediately adjacent to it. The area occupied by these
two buildings and the vicinity thereof was partially graded prepara-
tory to the placing thereon of other small exhibits and the providing
of pleasing open spaces. A small amount of work was accomplished
in connection with other minor grounds improvement, tree surgery,
and miscellaneous improvements.

Moving into the new quarters in the large-mammal house meant
several days of big jobs. A contract was entered into with a concern
equipped for moving large, heavy objects, and from September 1 to
September 22, as the African and Sumatran elephants, the hippo-

67
114728—39—6
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

potamuses, and rhinoceros could be induced to enter large substantial
crates, they were moved from their old quarters into the new, large-
mammal house. Almost a full day was required for each animal
moved, and in some cases the gates of the Park were closed so that
visitors would not be in the way and would not be jeopardized should
an accident occur. Every possible precaution had been taken to
insure the successful accomplishment of the moves, and there was no
unhappy incident. The suggestion had been frequently made that
the elephants might be walked up to the building, but they had not
been accustomed to discipline outside of their yards, and it was
deemed inadvisable to do this. The crate used to move the elephants
was 10 feet 10 inches high, 7 feet 4 inches wide, and 18 feet long,
overall, and weighed 514 tons. Other smaller animals, such as the
tapirs and pigmy hippopotamuses, were moved by the Park force.

THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC SOCIETY—SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION EXPE-
DITION TO THE EAST INDIES

As was recorded in the previous annual report, this expedition left
Washington in two sections. On January 19, 1937, Dr. Mann, direc-
tor of the Park, Mrs. Mann, and Dr. Maynard Owen Williams, chief
of the foreign editorial staff of the National Geographic Magazine,
sailed from Vancouver, B. C., for the Orient. Making various stops
en route, and visiting zoos in Japan, China, and Malaya, they finally
reached Pematang Siantar, in Sumatra, where the base camp was
established. On February 9, Roy Jennier, assistant head keeper, and
Malcolm Davis, keeper of the National Zoological Park, left Wash-
ington with 28 American animals and, sailing by way of Cape of
Good Hope, arrived at the Sumatra base camp on March 22%.

While the headquarters had been near the north end of the Island
of Sumatra, the animals were assembled from widely scattered points
in the southern Asiatic and Malayan region. Dr. and Mrs. Mann had
made trips to Siam, Johore, Singapore, Java, Celebes, and the Mo-
luccas, and had arranged with numerous parties to assist in the col-
lection of specimens. Noteworthy help was obtained from J. A.
Coenraad, director of the zoo at Siantar; J. M. Lynkamp, manager
of the Naga Hoeta Tea Estate, in Sumatra; and A. Baron Van
Styrum, of the Deli Railroad. The giraffes and African buffaloes
were loaded at Port Sudan, in accordance with arrangements that
had been made with the game warden of the Khartoum Government,
Egyptian Sudan.

His Highness, the Crown Prince of Johore, presented the expedi-
tion with a pair of black leopards and a fine Bennett’s cassowary.
From the Zoo at Fort de Kock, through C. Grootes, and from the Zoo
at Batavia, through J. M. N. A. Niemans, were received a number of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 69

valuable specimens. W. L. Basapa, of Singapore, presented a Baska
turtle, and Dr. Harold Coolidge of the Harvard Primate Expedition,
a pair of Himalayan bears.

This expedition was financed by the National Geographic Society,
and the results to the Zoo were highly gratifying. On its return
all members of the party except Dr. Williams arrived in New York
September 27, 1937, where the shipment of 193 crates of animals was
divided. Seventeen hoofed animals were placed in quarantine in
the Bureau of Animal Industry’s station at Athenia, N. J., and the
remaining animals were brought to Washington by express. They
were sorted at the express car and loaded into trucks destined to
the respective buildings in the Zoo, and by noon of September 28
a large proportion of them were in their new quarters, taking baths,
grooming themselves, and otherwise getting ready to receive visitors
who were already arriving.

After the animals were finally counted and identified, it was found
that the expedition had brought in the following:

The collection included numerous species never before exhibited
in the Zoo, and other species that had been badly needed. Among
them were Asiatic tapirs, both species of orang-utans, a pair of gaur,
16 birds of paradise of 4 different species, and a great many other
desirable birds. In the reptile collection were four species of cobras,
including two fine specimens of Hamadryads.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

In the previous annual report under this topic, the following
appeared :

The old frame shelter now housing the restaurant and concession stand
is badly deteriorated and entirely inadequate to accommodate the large vol-
ume of business that has developed with the increasing attendance at the Zoo.

Construction of a suitable building would be a self-liquidating
undertaking, as the annual revenue derived from the restaurant con-
cession has been $6,012 per annum for the three years prior to July
1937, and for the following three years will be $9,012 per annum.
This money is deposited in the United States Treasury to the credit of
the General Fund, District of Columbia, and not available to the Zoo.

About 3 o’clock every afternoon, except Sundays and holidays, a
census is made of the cars parked on the Zoo grounds. During the
year, 31,159 were so listed, representing every State in the Union,
Canada, Mexico, Canal Zone, Alaska, Cuba, Panama, Hawaii, and
Puerto Rico. Since the total number is merely a record of those
actually parked at one time, it is not of value as indicating a total
attendance but is of importance as showing the percentage attendance
by States, Territories, and countries. The District of Columbia com-
prised slightly over 51 percent; Maryland, 19 percent; Virginia, 11
percent; and the remaining cars were from other States, Territories,
and countries. During years in which counts have been made on
Sunday as well as during the week it has been found that the per-
centage of cars from the District of Columbia, Maryland, and Vir-
ginia is less, and the percentage of the more distant States 1s corre-
spondingly increased. This is brought about by tourists coming to
the Zoo on Sundays when other points of interest are closed to them.

ACCESSIONS

Gifis—A number of specimens were received as gifts during the
year. Among the most interesting additions were two East African
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY re |

hedgehogs from President Franklin D. Roosevelt ; a Chapman’s zebra
from Mrs. Robert C. Winmill, Warrenton, Va.; a pair of dingos, one
South African spitting cobra, one golden cobra, and one puff adder
from the New York Zoological Park. From the Firestone Rubber
Plantations, Liberia, through George Siebold, manager, were received
a chimpanzee and a young leopard. The Florida Boy Scout con-
tingent attending the jamboree in the city presented a collection of
33 reptiles from their State.

The field representatives of the United States Biological Survey
continued their generosity in the form of various gifts, most important
of which were two bison (one an albino) from the National Bison
Range, Moiese, Mont.; three California murres, and one tufted puffin,
through O. J. Murie, Seattle, Wash.

REMOVALS

Deaths —The death on August 12, 1937, of “Babe,” the Indian ele-
phant presented to the Park in May 1934 by Ringling Brothers-
Barnum and Bailey Circus, removed a famous animal with a record
of 51 years with circuses, and more than 3 years in the Zoo. Other
major losses included two Asiatic tapirs, one Bactrian camel, and a
Steller’s sea lion.

All specimens of scientific value that died during the year were sent
to the National Museum.

APPENDIX 8
REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the
activities of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1938:

WORK AT WASHINGTON

RECOMPUTATIONS

The recomputation of solar-constant values under the direction of
L. B. Aldrich, referred to in last year’s report, was the main business.
A considerable force of extra computers was employed on a job
basis under grants-in-aid from John A. Roebling. Also a consider-
able force of W. P. A. workers was assigned to the project. With
the regular force and these extra workers the immense task is nearly
completed. It is hoped to finish the entire recomputations and com-
parisons of solar-constant results from all stations by January 1939,
so as to make up a homogeneous series of daily values from 1923
to the present time.

STELLAR SPECTRUM ENERGY CURVES

In 1922, 1923, 1928, and 1934, attempts were made, in cooperation
with the Mount Wilson Observatory, to measure the distribution of
energy in the spectra of some of the brighter stars. The measure-
ments were made in the focus of the 100-inch reflecting telescope.
Results of some value were reached in 1923 and 1928, using a pris-
matic spectroscope and the radiometer. In 1934 it was attempted,
in cooperation with Dr. Joel Stebbins, to observe at 10 wave lengths
selected by Christiansen filters, employing a photoelectric cell. Un-
fortunately, owing to the great inequality of sensitiveness of the cell
for different wave lengths of radiation, these observations proved
valueless.

Since 1934 repeated attempts have been made at Washington to
devise a radiation-measuring instrument with a black absorbing sur-
face. We desired to attain sufficient sensitiveness to get good meas-
urements with the Christiansen filters for stars as faint as third
magnitude. In the opinion of able astronomers this would be a
highly valuable accomplishment, indeed one of the most interesting

99
114728—39——8
100 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

for astronomy. It is to be hoped that when the 200-inch telescope
becomes available such a sensitive measuring instrument may be used
successfully with a prismatic or grating spectroscope, and with pho-
tographic registration, so as actually to secure continuous spectral
energy curves of the brighter stars.

In our attempts to realize the highly sensitive measuring device,
we tried for several months to perfect the kampometer, but it did
not quite reach our demands. We then turned to the improvement
of the galvanometer, hoping to use it to observe the indications of the
delicate thermopile such as L. B. Clark now constructs for use in the
Division of Radiation and Organisms. Our intention was to employ
with the galvanometer the magnetic shield which was constructed for
us about 18 years ago by the late Dr. Elihu Thomson of Lynn, and
to insert therein, in highly evacuated space, a galvanometer of the
Kelvin suspended magnetic system type. We hoped by high evacu-
ation to be able to use a very light system at a time of single swing
as high as 10 seconds, and that the sensitiveness would be found
nearly proportional to the square of time of swing, even up to this
long period. As the magnetic shield is very effective indeed, we at-
tempted at first to use a galvanometer of only one pair of coils, with
a single group of magnets. But while this arrangement is evidently
the most sensitive possible, we found that what was gainéd in sensi-
tiveness was more than lost in instability. Accordingly, we con-
structed an astatic system with two opposed groups of magnets sepa-
rated but little over 10 millimeters between centers, and two pairs of
correspondingly small coils, making a combined resistance of about
17 ohms.

Preliminary trials at Washington indicated a high sensitiveness,
but with the mechanical and electrical disturbances unavoidable in
a city, we could not tell whether the stability was adequate. To test
this question, Messrs. Abbot and Hoover observed, by invitation, with
this galvanometer at John A. Roebling’s estate in Florida in March
1938. They found a 10-second single swing easily practicable; the
proportionality of sensitiveness to the square of time of swing nearly
followed up to that period, and the stability was so good that readings
at a scale distance of 5 meters seemed likely to disclose vibrations only
rarely exceeding 1 millimeter in amplitude.

Tests with the thermopile and candle flame seemed to indicate
that the new combination would prove between 10 and 100 times
as effective as the combination employed by Dr. Abbot in 1928. Mr.
Hoover made a new and better magnetic system after returning
from Florida. The excellent showing of the galvanometer is almost
wholly due to his work, though based on the extensive researches of
Messrs. Abbot and Fowle about the years 1898 to 1900.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 101

In May 1938 Mr. Hoover went to Mount Wilson to prepare for
new measurements of the energy in the spectra of the stars, and to
make studies of the growth of plants in monochromatic rays, taken
from sunlight by Christiansen filters. It may be said, by anticipa-
tion, that in both researches Mr. Hoover has been able to make
gratifying progress, as will be reported next year. It may even be
said now with confidence that when the 200-inch telescope is avail-
able it will be possible to get excellent continuous stellar spectrum
energy curves for all types of stars. Thus far Mr. Hoover has suc-
ceeded in measuring electric currents with his 17-ohm galvanometer
of 1X10-?? amperes, and to observe the rays of a candle flame on a
thermoelement of 1 millimeter diameter from a candle distance of
150 meters.

ATMOSPHERIC TURBIDITY AND MOISTURE APPARATUS

In 1930 we constructed a special instrument, containing a spectro-
bolometer, an Angstrém pyrheliometer, and a pyranometer, for the
use of Mr. Moore in testing the availability of mountain sites in and
near Africa for solar-constant work. With this portable instrument
he could determine the total precipitable water in the atmospheric
path of sun rays, as well as total intensity of solar radiation, and
the brightness of the sky. This instrument came to the attention of
the United States Weather Bureau, and was considered to be of much
promise for their work. At the request of Chief Gregg, the Smith-
sonian Institution has undertaken to duplicate it for the Weather
Bureau, and the instrument maker, Mr. Kramer, is at work thereon.

UTILIZING SOLAR RADIATION

Some further progress has been made by Dr. Abbot on devices for
utilizing solar radiation. While in Florida, in March, he tried out
with gratifying results a solar flash boiler, a solar water distiller,
and a toy solar cooker.

FIELD STATIONS

Several considerations led to the abandonment of the Mount St.
Katherine solar-radiation station in December 1937. The isolation of
the station made its occupation hazardous. Its remoteness and isola-
tion made its upkeep costly. An intestinal infection attacked all of
the observers and proved stubborn to cure. The likelihood of a great
European war made it probable that the observatory might be wholly
cut off from Washington. The station was abandoned with regret,
for meteorologically it had proved to be excellent, perhaps equal to
Montezuma.
102 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

Instead of St. Katherine, it was decided to locate a station in south-
western New Mexico. This location seemed to partake of the clima-
tological advantages of Old Mexico. Our other stations, both north-
ern and southern, have all had relatively bad observing conditions
in the months December to March. In Old Mexico and southwestern
New Mexico, on the contrary, these months promise to be the most
cloudless of all.

A. F. Moore has located the new station on Burro Mountain near
Tyrone, N. Mex., at a level of about 8,000 feet. The living conditions
there seem to give promise of being quite as attractive as at Table
Mountain. It lies not far from four fair-sized towns, the people of
the vicinity are helpful and pleasant, and the United States Forest
Service is exceedingly helpful and welcoming regarding the project.
It is hoped to be ready to observe in October or November 1938.

With two pleasant stations besides Washington in the United
States, and one more isolated one in Chile, it seems feasible to rotate
the observers hereafter without undue privation.

The stations at Table Mountain and Montezuma have continued
to observe the solar constant of radiation daily, when possible.

ULTRAVIOLET SOLAR RADIATION

Having failed thus far to obtain sufficient financial support to oper-
ate enough solar-constant stations to determine adequately the varia-
tion of the sun on every day of the year, as referred to in last year’s
report, it has been hoped to accomplish in some other way a program
of measuring solar variation as influencing weather. Several possi-
bilities exist. For recent years, in America, England, and Australia,
records of atmospheric ionization at great altitudes are being obtained
by several institutions and individuals. The ionization is thought
to be dependent on solar radiation, far in the ultraviolet spectrum, at
wave lengths less than 1000 angstroms. Results seem to indicate
that these rays vary over a great range, perhaps as much as 500
percent. It is hoped that these measurements may be correlated
with weather.

Inasmuch, however, as both theory and our preliminary observa-
tions indicate that the variation of the sun, which is only of the
order of 1 or 2 percent in the total radiation, may be as great as
15 or 20 percent at ultraviolet wave lengths about 3300 angstroms,
it was hoped that automatic sounding balloon methods might be
developed whereby the variation of the sun’s radiation in this part
of the ultraviolet spectrum could be measured accurately enough for
weather predicting. To this end the Smithsonian Institution made
two grants in aid to Dr. Brian O’Brien, of Rochester, N. Y. Dr.
O’Brien, aided also by the University of Rochester and by several
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 103

generous manufacturing corporations, has gone far to develop highly
ingenious methods and apparatus for measuring solar variation in
the ultraviolet from sounding balloons, automatically observed on
the ground through radio transmission of signals. He hopes soon
to be in position to compare this type of results with those of solar-
constant work reported from our stations.

PUBLICATION

Dr. Abbot published a résumé of his studies on solar variation and
weather changes in a number of the Czechoslovak scientific journal
concerning physics, prepared in honor of Dr. 8S. Hanzlik. A small
number of separates of this résumé are available for distribution if
solicited by interested parties.

PERSONNEL

F. E. Fowle, who entered the service of the Astrophysical Observa-
tory in 1894, having been retired for disability, W. H. Hoover, who
has heretofore had special status with the Astrophysical Observatory,
as a field director, was promoted to the position of Senior Astro-
physicist on October 16, 1937.

REPORT ON THE DIVISION OF RADIATION AND
ORGANISMS

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the ac-
tivities of the Division of Radiation and Organisms during the year
ended June 30, 1938:

The fundamental facts relating to plant growth and radiation have
been fruitfully pursued by the Division during the year. Mr. Hoover,
temporarily loaned for studies of radiation and photosynthesis, had
been recalled for continuous work with the Astrophysical Observa-
tory. To assist in these and other plant studies under Dr. Johnston’s
immediate direction, Dr. R. L. Weintraub was engaged. He de-
veloped an improved method of measuring plant growth substances
which are concerned in the bending of plants toward the light. A
description of this method with data from a number of experiments
is now ready for publication under the title, “An assay method for
plant growth substances utilizing straight growth of the Avena
coleoptile.” Dr. Weintraub is continuing the earlier work of Dr.
Johnston on the growth of the first internode in light of very low in-
tensities and in different spectral regions. It is interesting to note
that the plant responds to light intensities far below those which can
be detected by the most sensitive thermocouples.

Messrs. Johnston, McAlister, Weintraub, Clark, and Fillmen have
been preparing a new automatic apparatus for measuring and record-
ing photosynthesis continuously. It is similar in nature to the de-
vice employed by Dr. McAlister, to which reference was made in last
year’s report, but with the added feature of continuous automatic
photographic registration. This new apparatus was nearly ready for
use at the close of the fiscal year. It is to be used with a powerful
light source, comprising a 60-inch army searchlight, loaned by the
War Department, and a battery of mirrors at the focus of the beam
so placed that slender plants such as wheat, or others, may be il-
luminated strongly from all sides. Experiments of many kinds re-
lating to photosynthesis and the formation of chlorophyll are about
to be taken up with this efficient outfit. Another piece of apparatus
has been developed for the determination of chlorophyll. Very good
results can be obtained with concentrations as low as 0.1 mg chloro-
phyll per liter of solution. This equipment is being used in con-

105
106 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

nection with the CO, absorption studies and the formation of
chlorophyll.

Among other projects, photosynthesis in algae is to be investigated.
In preparation for this research Dr. Johnston and Dr. Meier have
been testing various methods of producing thin coatings of living
algae on rods and plates, without the interposition of water layers
between the algae and such light source as may be employed. Success-
ful cultures of this sort have been made.

Dr. Meier had a very serious fall in early December 1937 and was
incapacitated until June 1938, but returned to work part time in June
and full time in July. Prior to her accident she made further ob-
servations on stimulation of multiplication of algae by ultraviolet
rays which in larger dosage would be lethal. While the results ob-
tained certainly point strongly to a positive conclusion, further
work must be done before publication.

Dr. Johnston has continued investigations on mixtures of artificial
lights suitable to promote fully satisfactory plant growth under
laboratory conditions.

Dr. McAlister has made prolonged further studies on the depend-
ence of the induction periods in the photosynthesis of wheat on the
length of previous dark exposures. In addition, an uptake of CO, by
leaves in darkness has been discovered which has an important bear-
ing on photosynthesis. These phenomena are held by students of
photosynthesis to be of the greatest possible interest in obtaining an
understanding of the fundamental reactions which occur in plants
under the influence of light. Until the perfection of the technique by
Dr. McAlister, and his introduction of spectroscopy, as a highly
sensitive means of instantaneously measuring carbon dioxide assimila-
tion, the subject was practically beyond the possibility of investiga-
tion. But during the past year he has accumulated great numbers
of results which are the foundation of a paper he will shortly publish
under the title: “Chlorophyl—CO, ratio during photosynthesis,”
which it is believed will be of the very highest interest to students of
this subject. As heretofore the technical work of the Division has
been ably promoted by Messrs. Clark and Fillmen.

As noted under the Report on the Astrophysical Observatory, Mr.
Hoover has made interesting experiments at Mount Wilson, Calif., on
growing plants to maturity in narrow ranges of spectrum selected
from the sunbeam. This work will be described in next year’s report.

The following publications have been issued from the Division
during the fiscal year:

APPENDIX 10
REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the Smithsonian library for the fiscal year ended June 30,

1938:
THE LIBRARY

The library, or library system, of the Smithsonian comprises 45
libraries. Chief among these are the Smithsonian deposit in the Li-
brary of Congress, which is the main library of the Institution, and
the libraries of the United States National Museum and the Bureau of
American Ethnology. The others are the Langley aeronautical li-
brary, also deposited in the Library of Congress, the Smithsonian
office library, the libraries of the Astrophysical Observatory, Freer
Gallery of Art, National Collection of Fine Arts, National Zoological
Park, Radiation and Organisms, and the sectional libraries, 35 in
number, of the National Museum.

PERSONNEL

Two changes occurred in the library staff. Mrs. George C. Rodgers,
senior stenographer, withdrew from Government service, and the po-
sition was reclassified to that of assistant clerk-stenographer and filled
by the appointment of Miss Nancy Alice Link, through transfer from
the Bureau of Internal Revenue. The assistant messenger, Joseph
A. Salat, Jr., resigned and Clyde E. Bauman was transferred to the
vacancy from the United States Naval Academy. The temporary
assistants were Mrs. Gladys S. Wilson, Miss Margaret Kober, and 17
employees assigned to the library by the Works Progress Administra-
tion.

EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS

The exchange work of the library was noteworthy. It brought to
the receiving room 22,800 packages by mail and 2,464 by the Inter-
national Exchange Service—a total of 25,264, each containing one
or more publications. Besides several generous sendings from the
United States, such as those from the American Antiquarian Society,
the Paleontological Institution, and the University of Washington,
there were many from abroad, the largest being from the Koninklijke

109
110 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

Akademie van Wetenschappen, Amsterdam; Uceni Spolecnost
Safarikova, Bratislava; Academie Royale des Sciences de Belgique,
Brussels; Polskiego Towarzystwa Przyrodnikéw im. Kopernika,
Lwoéw; Royal Society of Victoria, Melbourne; Naturforscher-Verein
zu Riga, Riga; Kgl. Norske Videnskabernes Selskab, Trondheim ; and
the universities of Basel, Cambridge, and Lille.

The 6,037 dissertations received represented an increase of 670 over
the year before. Of these, 2,265 were added to the Smithsonian
deposit, 2,971, having to do largely with medical subjects, were turned
over to the Surgeon General’s library, and the rest, being duplicates,
were sent, under a special exchange arrangement, to Columbia Uni-
versity. They came from the universities of Basel, Berlin, Bern,
Bonn, Breslau, Cornell, Erlangen, Freiburg, Giessen, Greifswald,
Heidelberg, Jena, Kiel, Kénigsberg, Louvain, Lund, Lwéw, Marburg,
Neuchatel, Pennsylvania, Rostock, Strasbourg, Tiibingen, Utrecht,
Wiirzburg, and Ziirich, and the technical schools of Berlin, Braun-
schweig, Delft, Dresden, Karlsruhe, and Ziirich.

The number of letters—2,403—prepared by the staff in course of
the exchange and other work of the library was larger than in 1937,
as was the number of publications obtained by special request to
meet needs in the various libraries of the Institution. The latter
totaled 5,315, more than one-half of which were for the library of
the National Museum. In connection with the effort to provide by
exchange publications essential to the work of the Smithsonian and
its bureaus, the library staff handled 582 want cards and arranged for
285 new exchanges. It should be said, however, in passing, that
hundreds of the volumes and parts in question were found among
the duplicates in the west stacks, a further indication of the value
of this collection and of the effectiveness of the organization to which
it has been subjected.

Finally, it is a pleasure to report that the year marked the return
to stock of numerous sendings, both large and small, of Smithsonian
publications from libraries outside of Washington where they were
duplicates. Thus the supply available for exchange use was again
substantially increased.

GIFTS

The gifts during the year were numerous. From the Geophysical
Laboratory came 3,312 miscellaneous publications, from the American
Association for the Advancement of Science 653, and from the Ameri-
can Association of Museums 209, among them a goodly number of
scientific serials that were especially welcome.

From the libraries of the late Dr. Walter Hough and Dr. Fred-
erick V. Coville, former members of the scientific staff, came, through
Mrs. Hough and Mrs. Coville, many important books and pamphlets.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Tt

And from Mrs. Charles D. Walcott and the scientists of the Institu-
tion, notably Secretary Abbot and Assistant Secretary Wetmore, even
more publications than usual were received.

But perhaps the outstanding gift of the year was made by Mrs.
William Woodville Rockhill, widow of the one-time American Min-
ister to China. This consisted of 1,186 volumes and pamphlets,
chiefly in Chinese and other Eastern languages, on the history and
culture of China. It was assigned, naturally, to the library of the
Freer Gallery of Art, where it supplements in a notable way the
Rockhill and other collections, as these supplement appreciably,
for research purposes, the Division of Orientalia in the Library of
Congress.

Other gifts included the following: La Mostra del Tintoretto, Cata-
logo delle Opere, from Count Urbano de Bellegarde; Pintura Mexi-
cana (1800-1860), by Roberto Montenegro, from Angel Rosas; Tur-
key in Pictures, from his Excellency, the Turkish Ambassador to
the United States; Description Géométrique Détaillée des Alpes
Francaises, Annexe du Tome Second and Annexe du Tome Dixiéme
(2 copies of each), by Paul Helbronner, from Le Maréchal Pétain;
reprint of The Cactaceae, in 4 volumes, by N. L. Britton and J. N.
Rose (Publication No. 248 of the Carnegie Institution of Washing-
ton), from The Cactus and Succulent Society of America; Nikola
Tesla, a volume issued on the occasion of his 80th birthday, from
La Société pour la Fondation de l'Institut Nikola Tesla; A Catalogue
of the Pictures and Drawings in the Collection of Frederick John
Nettlefold, Volumes III-IV, by C. Reginald Grundy and F. Gordon
Roe, from Frederick John Nettlefold; Mollusques Terrestres et

Kerville; The Works of Edwin Howland Blashfield, with an Intro-
duction by Royal Cortissoz, from Mrs. Grace Hall Blashfield; The
Geology of Pennsylvania, Volume I and Volume II, Parts 1 and 2, by
Henry Darwin Rogers, from John W. Berry for the family of the
late R. D. Lacoe, who, before his death in 1900, presented the Institu-
tion with a valuable collection of coal fossils and his library on
paleozodlogy; The Birds of Tropical West Africa, Volume IV, by
David Armitage Bannerman, from The Crown Agents for the Col-
onies, London; Captains and Mariners of Early Maryland, by Dr.
Raphael Semmes, from the author; Complete Self-Instructing Li-
brary of Practical Photography, in 10 volumes, edited by S. B.
Schriever, from Mrs. A. B. Stebbins; Automobilens Historia, by John
Nerén, from the author; 15 books and pamphlets on various subjects,
including Historia de la Medicina en el Uruguay, Volumes 1-2, by

1 These holdings do not, of course, include the thousands of volumes still incomplete, uncataloged, or
unbound.

The staff recorded 23,992 periodicals; cataloged 6,449 publications;
prepared and filed 42,568 catalog and shelf list cards; borrowed
2,239 volumes from the Library of Congress and other libraries; and
made 11,380 loans, 340 of which were to libraries outside the Smith-
sonian system. They also advanced materially the index of exchange
relations and the index of Smithsonian publications. The work on
the union catalog was as follows:

OTHER ACTIVITIES

The staff took down the exhibition set of Smithsonian publications
that for 10 years had formed an imposing monument in the main hall
and filed it away for future service. They brought together the
archives set, checked it, and shelved it in a safe and convenient place.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 13

They supervised the 17 W. P. A. employees assigned to the library
in such tasks as cleaning, repairing, and binding books, putting
pamphlets into binders and lettering them, renovating plates and
maps, typing cards, filling out acknowledgment forms, mounting
aeronautical clippings, sorting and filing duplicates, and assisting
with the cataloging.

They effected special exchanges of duplicates with the libraries of
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Marine Biological Labora-
tory, Woods Hole, Staten Island Association of Arts and Sciences,
American Museum of Natural History, United States Patent Office,
and the following colleges and universities: Brown, California,
Catholic, Columbia, Duke, Harvard, Michigan, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, Princeton, Stanford, Williams, and Yale. By these
transactions they placed many publications not wanted by the Insti-
tution where they would be useful and obtained many that were
needed in the collections. Among the latter were Forges and
Furnaces in the Province of Pennsylvania, issued by the Pennsyl-
vania Society of the Colonial Dames of America; The Cannon
Collection of Italian Paintings of the Renaissance, mostly of the
Veronese School, by J. Paul Richter; The African Republic of
Liberia and the Belgian Congo, Volume II, edited by Richard P.
Strong; A Guide to the History and Historic Sites of Connecticut,
in 2 volumes, by Florence §. M. Crofut; Practice of Tempera Paint-
ing, and Materials of Medieval Painting, by Daniel V. Thompson;
Eclipses of the Sun, third edition revised and enlarged, by S. A.
Mitchell; A Catalogue of the Epstean Collection on the History and
Science of Photography and Its Applications Especially to the
Graphic Arts, by Edward Epstean; Benjamin Franklin’s Own Story,
by Nathan G. Goodman; Roman Glass from Karanis, by Donald B.
Harden; Annual Review of Biochemistry, Volume VII, edited by
J. M. Luck and C. R. Noller; and numerous volumes and parts of
the Meddelelser om Gr¢nland.

The staff continued the revision of the files of society and engineer-
ing publications in the natural history and technological libraries of
the National Museum, thus making these important sets more avail-
able for use. The work with the latter was expedited by the arrival
of the steel shelving that had been ordered toward the close of 1937.

They finished recataloging the sectional library of botany and
began that of administration.

And they spent even more time than usual identifying for the
scientists of the Institution obscure citations found in the literature
of their respective subjects, and providing data, including not a few
bibliographies, for letters in answer to requests for information
received from different parts of the country.
114 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938
BINDING

The allotment for binding was again very inadequate, permitting
the libraries to bind only as follows: National Museum, 494 vol-
umes; National Collection of Fine Arts, 45; Astrophysical Observa-
tory, 86. The total, 575 volumes, was but a fraction of the number
that, for the good of the collections, should have been bound. It
is earnestly hoped that more funds can soon be made available for
binding, that this interest of the Smithsonian libraries—an interest
essential to their preservation and usefulness—may be provided for
satisfactorily. In 1935 the average charge for binding was about
$3.25 a volume, while in 1938 it had risen to approximately $5. This
difference of $1.75 has woefully reduced the number of volumes that
can be bound with the sums annually allowed for this purpose.

Fortunately, the Freer Gallery of Art, with funds of its own for
binding, was able to have 57 volumes bound. Fortunately, too, the
Smithsonian Institution, taking advantage of the services of an
expert binder and of two assistants assigned to it under the W. P. A.,
was able to have 414 volumes bound and 148 volumes and 994 pam-
phlets repaired for several of its libraries.

But there remain thousands of unbound volumes, especially in
the National Museum, Bureau of American Ethnology, Astrophys-
ical Observatory, and National Collection of Fine Arts. Most of
the volumes are made up of serial parts. As many of these are in
daily use, they are constantly running the risk of being damaged or
destroyed. And it frequently happens that a part, once lost, cannot
be replaced, particularly if it belongs to a foreign volume of limited
issue,

NEEDS

The need of increased funds for binding has already been men-
tioned. Other needs are only a little less urgent. They are as fol-
lows: Two or more well-trained catalogers to work chiefly in the main
library in the Natural History Building; another messenger to assist
in the libraries in the Smithsonian Building and the Arts and Indus-
tries Building; more shelf room for the library collections in all
three of the principal buildings of the Institution.

Respectfully submitted.

Dr. C. G. Axsort,

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.

FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Karly in 1906, by deed of gift, Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, gave
to the Institution his collection of Chinese and other oriental objects
of art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art by
Whistler, Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also gave
funds for the construction of a building to house the collection, and
finally in his will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock and
securities to the estimated value of $1,958,591.42 as an endowment
fund for the operation of the gallery. From the above date to the
present time these funds have been increased by stock dividends,
savings of income, etc., to a total of $4,820,777.31. In view of the
importance and special nature of the gift and the requirements of the
testator in respect to it, all Freer funds are kept separate from the
other funds of the Institution, and the accounting in respect to them
is stated separately.

The invested funds of the Freer bequest are classified as follows:

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1938

ee

ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the GrnrERAL ApprNnpiIx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific
discovery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such
papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific
progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely
the prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy,
geology, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zool-
ogy, and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not
altogether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them origi-
nal) embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and
discussion. This method has been continued in the present report
for 1938.

NEW CONCEPTIONS OF THE UNIVERSE AND OF MATTER!

By GABRIEL LOvUIS-JARAY

The principles of physics appear to have been entirely reconstructed
since the beginning of the twentieth century; because of experiments
made during the past 30 years, new ideas prevail in this science;
man is endeavoring to explain the universe, the atom, matter, light
according to conceptions essentially different from those of the nine-
teenth century.

Louis de Broglie asserts that the introduction into physics in 1900
of the observations of Planck marks ‘‘one of the most important
moments in the evolution of contemporaneous science.”’? In pro-
moting that evolution a great number of French scholars have labored
and the “Palace of Discovery” exhibits some of their researches.

The efforts of physicists have been directed especially toward the
study of the infinitely small and of the infinitely large: Astrophysi-
cists have pushed their stellar observations to extraordinary distances
and atomic physics has succeeded in revealing the orbit of an element
of matter of which 10 million could be placed end to end in a milli-
meter. In one case as in the other, these studies require the use of
a laboratory equipment that can only be attained with an infinite
amount of care, time, and money. ‘This is one of the reasons which
explain why so many years were needed to bring out the new dis-
coveries, a glimpse of which we will try to present.

The older physics was founded upon the existence of simple ele-
ments, not transmutable, of which today there are 92. Alchemy and
the older physics had failed in the search for unity in matter.

The new physics considers that matter is composed of atoms all
formed essentially of two parts: A nucleus, called a proton, around
which revolves one or several corpuscles called electrons; the most
simple element is hydrogen, of which the nucleus is formed of a single
proton, around which a single electron revolves; by changing the
number and the arrangement of these two elements of the atom we
obtain the 92 simple elements. Efforts to transmute artificially
from one element to another have succeeded. Thus the new physics
is founded upon a real unity of matter.

130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

Nevertheless, there is uncertainty regarding the elements of this
unity. It was thought until very recently that all atoms could be
reduced to a nucleus composed of protons of positive electricity (each
proton having a mass 2,000 times greater than an electron) and of
electrons of negative electricity; the infinitely small atom appeared
to be asup in miniature with his planet or planets, and matter seemed
composed of electrified particles oscillating in space; Thibaut, director
of the institute of atomic physics of the University of Lyon, supposes,
in order to visualize the atom, that the atom of hydrogen be as big
as the whole of Paris; the nucleus would be the size of the Arc de
Triomphe, the electron would be represented by a billiard ball situated
in the Place de la Concorde and the remainder of the atom would be
empty space.®

But in these last years, the profound studies of matter from every
angle have more and more complicated the problem. Much uncer-
tainty exists; in effect man has discovered: First, an electron of posi-
tive electricity (called a positron), very difficult to obtain, which
scarcely born, seems to unite with other particles; its size is similar
to that of the negative electron, of which it is the brother; second, a
particle called the neutron, thus named because it is not electrified;
it is analogous to the proton in mass (2,000 times that of the electron)
and sometimes unites with the nucleus of the atom; third, a fifth
mysterious particle called a neutrino, because it is not electrified; it
is neutral like the neutron, but with a mass as small as the electron,
perhaps even smaller and almost negligible.

Our impression is that the new physics is still in its infancy. Some
physicists conceive of matter as electrified particles surrounded by
empty space; Thibaud asks whether the neutron cannot be separated
into two corpuscles, one positive and the other negative, and whether
the “hypothetical neutrino,” as he calls it, would not be the accom-
paniment of such a breaking up.* Louis de Broglie looks with more
favor on the breaking up of the proton into neutron and positive
electron.> Thus, according to this last authority, the atom and
matter are compounded of three elements: neutrons, not electrified,
possessing nearly all the mass, negative electrons and positive elec-
trons both of very small mass but electrified.

Nevertheless, the new physics is plainly built upon the idea of the
unity of matter.

3 Physicists and astrophysicists know but little about empty space in the atom or between celestial
bodies; they no longer believe in the “‘ether’’ of Fresnel. The astronomer Esclangon conceives space not as
nothingness but as an entity, furrowed with radiations, composed perhaps of unknown elements which
constitute a substratum of matter and radiation, capable of reactions similar to those of matter.

‘ Thibaud, Jean, Vie et transmutation des atomes, p. 110, Paris, Albin Michel, 1937.
§ Matiére et lumiére, p. 32.
THE UNIVERSE AND MATTER—LOUIS-JARAY 131

The new physics differs essentially from the old in other respects:
The old mechanics had its dogmas; no velocity could be greater than
that of light; no temperature could be less than zero degrees absolute;
matter could not be destroyed, etc.; this last law is no longer recog-
nized. Most of the outstanding physicists, such as Eddington, admit
“the annihilation of matter’ though it seems apparently supernatural.
One experiment shows that pairs of positive and negative electrons
are destroyed and produce pairs of photons of light, and in the opposite
sense the photons ® produce pairs of positive and negative electrons;
the first case appears to be a “‘dematerialization”’ and the second case
a ‘“materialization,” if the electrons are very small corpuscles but
material parts of the atom and if the photons, that is the radiations,
are not material corpuscles. Thus, says Einstein, in place of the
principle of the conservation of matter and of the conservation of
energy, it is necessary to substitute a simple principle of equivalence,
that of the ‘‘conservation of something,’ but permitting the con-
version of matter into energy and energy into matter. An example
shows this new conception in concrete fashion: An atom of helium
is formed from four atoms of hydrogen; but the mass of the helium is
less by a small quantity than the sum of four atoms of hydrogen;
this small quantity of matter has changed into energy and the clamp-
ing together of the four atoms has liberated, it is said, 27 millions of
volts; thus the loss of mass, or loss of matter, is compensated, accord-
ing to the principle of equivalence, by the creation of energy.

Thibaud interprets the results of such experiments as just described
by conceiving that it is the continuous destruction of matter in the
sun which liberates the luminous radiation.’ In any case one can
imagine throughout the universe the transformation of atoms of
sidereal bodies into radiation, as in radioactivity, or the transforma-
tion of radiation into matter as in the experiment with photons of
gamma rays.

One difficulty remains: We do not know with certainty what the
“photons” are, i. e., what light is. Louis de Broglie some 10 years
ago conceived, and soon the new physics adopted, his ‘‘wave mechan-
ics,” applied first to light and then to all forms of energy. Newton
asserted that light consisted of an emission of corpuscles, Fresnel
that it consisted of waves in a tenuous medium, the ether, the existence
of which modern physicists doubt, Louis de Broglie reunited the two
theories and declared that what happens is wave motion and emission
at the same time, light waves and the projection of corpuscles of light,
called photons. Passing from light to matter, he asserted that it is
necessary to link together the idea of a wave with the movement of
material particles of the atom; the displacement of the material

§ In the experiment, the photons are produced by a radiation called gamma rays.

132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

corpuscles is associated with a certain periodic phenomenon called a
wave.

According to physicists, this generalized hypothesis to account for
light and matter by wave mechanics explains all the recent experiments
which the older physics failed to explain. But it makes a great
mystery of physics; in a memoire, written in collaboration by Maurice
de Broglie and Louis de Broglie, we read that the photon is a corpuscle
of light whose nature remains very mysterious: Wave mechanics
associates with motion “‘the consideration of a wave, without physical
reality, but which can be predicted.” °

In any case, in the new physics, to the idea of the unity of matter
and of the interchangeability of energy and matter, it is necessary to
add the idea that, for light and for matter, one must always ‘‘consider
both the corpuscular aspect and the wave aspect, bound together by
the same general relations’’;® we come thus to the “unitarian theory
of matter and of light’’; Louis de Broglie obtains this unity by the
hypothesis that the neutrino, the last born of the constituent particles
of matter, a corpuscle as small as or smaller than the electron and
having “zero or at least a negligible charge in comparison with that
of an electron,’ may be one of two constituents of the photon, the
other being another corpuscle; he calls the neutrino a demiphoton;”
but if the neutrino has a “physical entity”? the photon becomes a
material corpuscle and not simply a corpuscle of immaterial light.

We perceive, by these simple indications, to what extent the new
physics is still mysterious and how it tends toward unity. It gives
at times the impression that all material reality, in the older sense of
the word, has disappeared and in its place there is substituted that
which one might call a unique substance having corpuscular atomic
form and possessing interchangeable attributes of mass and of energy.
It seems to lead thus to a kind of materialistic ‘‘monism,” outside of
which the mysteries of life and of mind exist.

In short, the new physics is distinguished from the old in that it
adopts conceptions which destroy the rigorous and universal determin-
ism of mechanics and the principle of continuity.

Atomic physics, it tells us, shows a discontinuous reality, with
abrupt transitions, which can only be explained ‘“‘by the artifice of
waves associated” with the motions of corpuscles. The introduction
into physics, says Louis de Broglie, about 1900, by Planck, of the
quantum of action and of the constant “th” is the origin of the change
of view; let us then analyze each of these two new ideas.

The “quanta” of Planck can be roughly explained by indicating
that the radiation of atoms is not continuous; apparently the energy

8 Matiére et lumiére, pp. 59 and 60.

® Matiére et lumiére, p. 147.
10 Op. cit., p. 153 and following.
THE UNIVERSE AND MATTER—LOUIS-JARAY 183

accumulates until a certain quantity is stored up; when this quantity
is reached, the radiation is emitted. Thus the radiation emanating
from the atom is not considered as a continuous outpouring, but as a
discontinuous emission of grains. Innumerable experiments since
1900 have shown that this quantity, called a ‘quantum,’ is propor-
tional to the frequency of the radiation and not to its intensity.
Maurice de Broglie has invented an apparatus for measuring the veloc-
ity of corpuscles (electrons) torn away from matter by the action of
X-rays, which gives an experimental test of this ‘““quantum”’ theory of
Planck." Physics is thus thrown into confusion by the substitution
in the microscopic domain of the principle of discontinuity in place of
the principle of continuity.

Leibnitz said that nature does not make jumps: Natura non facit
saltus; in the world of atoms, modern physics perceives nothing but
jumps. Atomic physics limits itself to uncovering the laws which
govern these jumps; it observes only the value, the quantum of energy;
it seeks to calculate the probability that an atomic system existing at
a given moment will find itself subsequently in such or such other
state; and atomic physics finds that these laws are only the laws of
probability. From the moment that one starts with the discontinuous
action of elementary corpuscles of matter and of light, one cannot
know whether at a given moment one of these corpuscles has or ought
to have a certain precise position in space or a certain strictly defined
motion; atomic physics declares it is impossible “‘to predict the future
motion of a corpuscle of an atom.’”’ Indetermination is substituted for
determinism; it is the ‘‘constant h”’ of Planck, the “‘uncertainty prin-
ciple of Heinsenberg.”’ All the experiments relative to ‘“‘quanta”’ for
30 years are affected by an unknown, an indeterminate element that
must be introduced to make the calculations succeed. This indeter-
minate constant has been represented by h, and it is even to this day
susceptible of no interpretation. All the determinism of the mechanics
of Newton is thus as if undermined at its base. ‘The significance (of
this constant),’”’ says Louis de Broglie, “‘has been for 30 years and still
is today the enigma of modern physics; it has remained the undefinable
syllable in nature’s cross-word puzzle.” This fundamental indeter-
minism appears as a sort of free choice of nature, escaping thus from
the rigorous law of mechanics.

It is scarcely necessary to add that this introduction of discontinuity
and indeterminism into physics is valid for the whole universe; but
the indeterminate constant, represented by h in the calculations, is
very small. Consequently, in the phenomena having to do with man
or the stars, it is negligible. A margin of uncertainty always exists,
but since it is less than the unavoidable errors which affect all observa-

11 Vie et transmutation des atomes, p. 164; the application of this effect called ‘‘photoelectric” is utilized in
television and in moving picture talking films.
134 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

tions, determinism is apparently maintained. In a way, the older
physics remains approximately exact for man and for heavenly bodies;
but it is powerless to determine at the same time with exactitude the
position and velocity of an electron at a given moment and to predict
with certainty its rigorously determined motion; discontinuity and
indeterminism are integral parts of the atomic world.

Astrophysicists and physicists who study atomic structure must
use their imagination; it is imagination which leads to experimentation
and interpretation. Butit is necessary at the same time to be prudent
in this respect; the ascribed interpretations are usually afterward
rejected.

New ideas can only be accepted as a result of conclusive and repeated
experiment. Especially is it necessary always to distinguish care-
fully between the results of experiments and the interpretation given
these results.

Thus, in astrophysics, since the work of Hubble in 1925, we con-
sider that the spiral nebulae visible through our telescopes are island
universes, analogous to the universe of which the earth, the sun, the
Milky Way, and all the ordinary stars are a part and which we call
“the galaxy.”

The velocities of about 100 of these distant spiral nebulae are
believed to have been determined, principally with the aid of the large
Mount Wilson telescope; it appears from this work that all are moving
away from us and with velocities as great as one-seventh of the velocity
of light. Moreover, Hubble presented in 1929 a law according to
which the velocity of recession is proportional to the distance; each
increase of 1 million light-years in distance increases the velocity of
recession by 170 kilometers per second. ‘Thus all the galaxies appear
to be running away from each other; they are fleeing from each other
with increasing speed; it is this conclusion which gives us the term
“the expanding universe,” and suggests to us that the universe has
doubled its radius in less than 2 billion years.’ But when the galaxies
will have attained a velocity as great as that of light, they can never
be seen by man, for light rays from them will be unable to reach the
earth. This will mean an unfathomable universe.

Of course, this interpretation rests upon the shift of lines in the
spectra of spiral nebulae examined through the Mount Wilson tele-
scope. Who can say that this shift of spectral lines will not soon be
interpreted differently? The study of spectra is sufficiently mysteri-
ous for the whole interpretation to be taken with reservations. 0
Moreover, the strangest feature about Hubble’s law is that it assumes

12 See Paul Coudere, Univers 1937, Paris, Editions rationalistes, 1937.
13 The astronomer Esclangon, for example, does not agree that light is absolutely constant and believes

that measures relative to the light of stars are different from terrestrial measures; these conceptions, moreover,
may be connected with those relating to interstellar space.
THE UNIVERSE AND MATIER—LOUIS-JARAY 135

for distant galaxies in no way related to our galaxy, any law whatso-
ever which governs the life of all galaxies by comparison with our own.

One other hypothesis of astrophysicists seeks to solve the contradic-
tion between the finite and the infinite; they call it the “curved uni-
verse.” Curvature, sphericity, is to be the law of matter. The
universe is shaped like an immense sphere, an enormous bubble; all
radiation follows a curve; light coming to us from distant galaxies is
bent. In consequence, light from a star ought to arrive at the earth
from two opposite sides, from one side by the direct curve and from
the other by making the complete circuit of the sphere. Let us await
experimental proof that the propagation of radiation, energy, or
light is not in a straight line but a curved path.

Without letting ourselves be carried away by imagination, let us
realize that the tests of the past 30 years have led physicists to modify
entirely their conceptions of the world, of light, of matter, of energy,
of the universe. The infinitely great and the infinitely small seem
immeasurable; they are not of the same order of magnitude as man.
The mind asks, at each stage, whether these discoveries are not only
symbols, constructions of the mind, whether they correspond to some-
thing entirely objective. At every moment one is tempted to say:
“This happens as if’; but one dares only say: ‘“This happens thus.”
At any rate, the new physics is the creator of mysteries. ‘These are
mysteries: The microscopic and the macroscopic, the indeterminism,
the discontinuity, elements which change from one substance into
another with the disappearance of part of their mass, the conversion of
matter into energy and energy into matter. In place of the older,
rigid mechanics, with the unalterable conservation of matter, with
all motion determinate, with elements whose positions and velocities
were known repeating themselves in ‘‘the form and motion” of Des-
cartes, there is substituted anew physics which is directed by new views
concerning the unity of matter and light, the principle of equivalence
including the conversion of energy into matter and matter into energy,
the introduction of discontinuity and indeterminism by wave ma-
chanics. These views completely change our conceptions of the
exterior world and of the universe.
THE NATURE OF THE NEBULAE!

By Epwin HussLe

[With one plate]

The exploration of space is an achievement of great telescopes.
Men first studied the heavens with their naked eyes. They recog-
nized and described the solar system—the central sun with its family
of planets—and the discovery is one of the great intellectual feats of
the race. But beyond the planets lay the stars. They were too
distant for reliable investigation, and their nature remained a subject
of sheer speculation.

For the human eye, with all its perfection, is necessarily a small
instrument; the aperture of the fully opened pupil is only a fifth of an
inch. Many an astronomer, in those early days, must have dreamed
of a giant’s eye that would collect more light, penetrate more deeply
into the universe around us. And eventually, that incredible dream
materialized. Just 330 years ago the telescope, newly invented, was
pointed toward the sky, and the way for exploration on the grand
scale was suddenly opened. Galileo, as Kepler wrote to him, had
scaled the very walls of heaven.

The centuries that followed were crowded with investigations that
led to the formulation of modern astronomy. ‘Telescopes and their
accessories developed and, with each advance, new fields were opened.
The nature of the stars was established. The sun itself was definitely
recognized as a star, and earlier speculation on the subject was thus
confirmed. The many millions of stars, it was found, are not scat-
tered indefinitely through the universe; they form an isolated system.
This swarm of stars, this stellar system, drifts through space. From
our position somewhere within the system, we look out through the
swarm of stars, past the borders, into the universe beyond.

Telescopes have continued to develop until today we are exploring
those outer regions. They are inhabited by stellar systems compar-
able with our system of the Milky Way. ‘Those other systems are
the extragalactic nebulae. We find them scattered thinly through
space out as far as telescopes can reach. They are gigantic beacons,
permitting us to survey and study a sample of the universe. Even-

tually, if the sample is fair, we may be able to infer the nature of the
universe as a whole from the observed characteristics of the sample
available for inspection. This possibility is the ultimate goal of the
explorations of space. The sample must be fair, and the characteris-
tics must be determined with precision. How near we are to the
realization of these conditions, we do not know, but we like to believe
that the new telescope—the 200-inch reflector destined for Mount
Palomar—may furnish an answer.

Meanwhile it is imperative to learn as much as possible with existing
instruments, concerning the nature of the inhabitants of space. The
nebulae are the landmarks that must necessarily be used in the general
study. The more intimately we know their characteristics—their
luminosities, dimensions, masses, structures and contents—the more
reliably can we interpret the reports of the final surveys.

Our present information is still fragmentary, but by piecing bits
together we can construct a fairly coherent picture. The nebulae, it
is found, are all members of a single family. The forms vary widely
but they fall readily into a sequence which represents the progressive
variation of a single fundamental pattern. ‘Thus it is possible to
reduce the nebulae to a standard type, and to study them as one
homogeneous group; or, it is possible to select conspicuous, neighboring
nebulae, and to present them as typical examples of the family. In
the discussion which follows, the latter alternative will be adopted.

THE LOCAL GROUP

On the grand scale, the nebulae are scattered more or less at ran-
dom; one large volume of space is much like another. Nevertheless,
the small scale distribution is quite irregular, and presents many
analogies with the distribution of stars. Thus we find isolated
nebulae, multiples, groups, clusters, and, possibly, clouds. Our own
stellar system is the chief component of a triple nebula, the Magel-
lanic Clouds playing the role of satellites. The great neighboring
spiral in Andromeda is also favored with two satellites. These two
triple systems, together with four or five other nebulae, form a loose
group more or less isolated in the general field. ‘The local group has
played an important role in the development of nebular research for
it furnished a small sample collection of nebulae so near that their
brighter stars could be studied with existing telescopes. These stars,
and, in particular, the Cepheid variables, furnished the criteria which
established the scale of distances, and thereby opened the realm of
the nebulae to actual exploration.
THE NATURE OF THE NEBULAE—HUBBLE 139

MESSIER 31

Except for our own stellar system, the most conspicuous member of
the local group is the great spiral in Andromeda, M31, with its two
satellites, M32 and NGC205. The spiral can be seen with the naked
eye as a faint cloud about half the size of the moon, and with a total
luminosity equal to that of a fourth- or fifth-magnitude star. When
photographed with telescopes, the cloud takes shape as an elliptical
object whose long diameter is above five times that of the moon, and
whose ratio of axes is about 3 or4to1. The central region is relatively
bright but the luminosity fades outward to poorly defined edges. The
spiral pattern has never been seen with any telescope, although it is
easily recognized on the photographic plate. The image increases
with the focal length of the telescope, ranging from perhaps a quarter-
inch with small kodaks to about 6 feet at the Cassegrain focus of the
100-inch refiector. Thus, with powerful instruments, the nebula must
be explored section by section. Our detailed information, at present,
is restricted to selected areas, chosen for specific purposes. Photo-
graphs show a semistellar nucleus of about the fourteenth magnitude,
surrounded by a central region of structureless, unresolved nebulosity,
from which two arms emerge on opposite sides and wind outward to
form the spiral pattern. The general pattern is repeated over and
over among the fainter nebulae in the sky, and the variations are
largely concerned with the relative amount of luminous material in
the arms as compared with that in the central region. On the basis
of this criterion, the normal spirals fall into a progressive sequence with
M31 near the middle. In other words, M31 is a typical example of
the intermediate type spirals. By analogy with other members of the
class, we may safely conclude that the elliptical form of the image is an
effect of foreshortening. The fundamental plane of the thin lens-
shaped spiral is tilted about 15° from the line of sight.

The outer regions of the spiral arms, in contrast to the nuclear region,
are partially resolved into separate stars—presumably the brighter
giants and supergiants of a stellar system comparable with our own
galactic system. On this assumption, the unresolved portions of the
arms and the nuclear region consist of swarms of stars too faint to be
seen individually. The fragmentary data now available, such as the
stellar outbursts called novae, and the solar-type spectrum, are
thoroughly consistent with this interpretation. The recognition of
stars in the outer regions was the clue which solved the mystery of the
distance. Various types of stars were recognized which are well
known in our own system. Among other characteristics, we knew
their intrinsic luminosities, or candlepowers, and, consequently, their
apparent faintness indicated the distance of the nebula in which they
were located. Once the distance (about 700,000 light-years) was
140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

determined, the real dimensions of the system were readily calculated
from the apparent dimensions.

The main body of the spiral, the portion that is conspicuous on well-
exposed photographs, has a diameter of about 35,000 to 40,000 light-
years, and a total luminosity of the order of 1,000 million suns.
Extremely faint outer regions, whose existence can be detected by
refined methods of investigation, more than double the over-all diam-
eter, and add perhaps 60 percent to the luminosity. Thus, the spiral is
revealed as a giant nebula, the greatest of all those whose individual
distances are known, and comparable with the galactic system itself.
It is surprising and even disturbing to find the two greatest known
systems both within the local group but, on the basis of our present
information, the conclusion seems unavoidable. To this extent we
seem to inhabit a favored position in the universe.

The mass of so immense a system as M31 must also be abnormally
large, although the precise quantity has not been determined. The
spiral is rotating, and the speed of rotation can be measured with the
spectrograph, but, as Zwicky has shown, such data alone do not furnish
an unambiguous value of the mass—they may suggest, at best, only a
lower limit. The relative, presumably orbital motions of the satellites
bear directly on the problem, but we can measure only one component
(namely, that in the line of sight) and, moreover, the planes of the
orbits together with the protection factors are unknown. Finally, we
can suppose that, among stellar systems in general, there exists a
characteristic relation between total mass and total luminosity which
may be evaluated with the aid of data from the galactic system. This
method also is uncertain because it involves several unverified assump-
tions such as the detailed similarity of stellar contents and the ratio of
dark to luminous material. Nevertheless, the different methods,
none of them individually reliable, agree in suggesting a mass of the
general order of 100,000 million suns, and we are inclined to believe
that the number of ciphers is about correct.

MESSIER 32

The two satellites of the giant spiral are both fainter than the
average nebula, and one of them, NGC205, is one of the faintest of
the known dwarfs. In other words, the triple system covers practi-
cally the whole observed range in total luminosities, namely, six
magnitudes, or about 1 to 250. The brighter satellite, M32, is
superposed on the outer arm of the main spiral, about 24’ south of
the nucleus. The actual location in the line of sight is a matter of
speculation. M32 is not a spiral but is a typical example of an
elliptical nebula (E2) with a ratio of axes about 8 to 10. It exhibits
no structure save for the smooth fading of the luminosity from the
THE NATURE OF THE NEBULAE—HUBBLE 14}

nucleus outward to undefined borders. The size of the image in-
creases steadily with exposure times (the isophotal contours remaining
similar ellipses), as far as the exposures have been pushed. Although
the dimensions have little meaning apart from the observing condi-
tions, the values usually quoted are a major diameter of 4’ or 800
light-years, and a total luminosity of the order of 20 million suns.
The values refer to the conspicuous portion of the image on well-
exposed photographs.

Very short exposures with the 100-inch telescope show a round,
semistellar nucleus, about 2” in diameter and about 13.4 magnitude.
This diameter merely reflects the resolving power of the photographic
plate, for visual examination shows a still smaller nucleus. Sinclair
Smith, using an interferometer on the 100-inch, found no trace of a
strictly stellar center, and concluded that the true nucleus is probably
a globular mass with a diameter of perhaps 0"8, or about 2 light-years.
The concentration of luminosity within such a nucleus would be
somewhat greater than that in the central region of the most compact
globular cluster—in other words, not inconsistent with the assump-
tion that the nebula is a system of stars.

The nucleus of M32 has been described at some length because, as
far as observations go, it appears to be typical of nebulae in general,
and, being relatively near, can be studied in greater detail. The
nucleus of our own system is presumably hidden behind dark obscur-
ing clouds in the Milky Way. Baade, using red-sensitive plates and
heavy filters, has partially penetrated the clouds, and, in the direction
of the galactic center and at latitude 4°, has recorded a star-density
which is of the order of 800,000 per square degree. Such a density
at perhaps 2,000 light-years from the actual center requires no un-
reasonable extrapolation to suggest a nuclear density comparable
with those in M32 and M31.

Since the satellite is superposed on the outer, partially resolved
region of the main spiral, the search for individual stars is somewhat
confused. It can be stated that there is no definite trace of resolu-
tion in the satellite, and, consequently, there are probably no super-
giants in the system. The available photographs probably establish
this conclusion down to I/=—2, and possibly to M=—1. Never-
theless, Sinclair Smith’s investigations indicate that the assumption
of a stellar constitution offers the most plausible and consistent
working hypothesis that has been formulated. Thus we are pre-
sented with the problem of a stellar system in which supergiants
are not present.

The problem assumes general significance because the satellite
closely resembles the nuclear region of the main spiral in color and
spectrum as well as texture, and both nebulae, as previously men-
tioned, are typical examples of their classes. The spiral exhibits a
142 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

complementary distribution—supergiants in the outer region, dwarfs
and (possibly) giants in the nuclear region. Among nebulae in
general, the relative distribution varies systematically through the
sequence of structural forms, the supergiants working inward as the
spirals unwind. The characteristic behavior offers a possible observa-
tional approach to the fundamental question of nebular evolution,
the first problem being a study of the systematic variation in stellar
contents of nebulae along the sequence of forms. This problem
requires the greatest possible light-gathering power and will be espe-
cially suitable for the 200-inch reflector when that telescope is com-
pleted. Meanwhile, the preliminary investigations are carried on
with the 100-inch, and some of the results for M31 will presently
be discussed.
NGC205

First, however, some mention should be made of the third member
of the triple system, the fainter satellite, NGC205. It lies about 37’
north preceding the nucleus of the main spiral, almost exactly along
the minor axis. As in the case of M32, the actual position in the line
of sight is wholly speculative. However, the radial velocity is
appreciably the same as that of the spiral, and, consequently, the
orbital motion must be almost entirely across the line of sight. This
situation is consistent with the assumption that the satellite may lie
close to the fundamental plane of the spiral. The distance between
the two nuclei would then be of the order of 30,000 light-years, and
the satellite would be located within the extremely faint, tenuous,
outer extensions of the spiral.

NGC205 is a nondescript system. In form and general texture, it
resembles an elliptical type (E5) with a ratio of axes about 2 to 1,
but the concentration toward the center is very low, small obscuring
clouds are involved, and several individual stars and small nebulous
objects (presumably globular clusters) seem to be associated with the
satellite. The dimensions, as usual, vary with exposures, but the
diameters are generally quoted as 8’ <4’ or 1,600 X 800 light-years, and
the total luminosity as about 7 million suns.

STELLAR CONTENTS OF MESSIER 31
OBSCURATION

Since the two satellites are unresolved, the main spiral alone offers
an opportunity to examine the stellar contents of a nebula. The
investigation reveals many analogies with the galactic system, con-
sistent with the current picture of our own nebula as a spiral at a
stage in the sequence somewhat later than M31. One of the most
conspicuous features is the great amount of obscuration. The
THE NATURE OF THE NEBULAE—HUBBLE 143

extreme north following end of the spiral is lightly veiled, and the
central half of the nebula, north preceding the major axis, is fainter
than the south following half. The latter feature is frequently used
in attempts to determine the true orientation—to identify the side of
the nebula which is nearest the observer. The question is still un-
answered, and with it another fundamental question concerning the
direction of rotation—whether the spiral is ‘‘winding up” or “un-
winding.”

In addition to the veiling of large areas, many obscuring clouds
are scattered over the nebula. The absorption has not been meas-
ured, but it seems hkely that the ‘‘all or none” principle is approxi-
mated. On the one hand, certain clouds seem to exhibit complete
absorption and, moreover, the spiral obscures the faint, distant, back-
ground nebulae in a very conspicuous manner. On the other hand,
stars of various known types, widely scattered over the spiral, exhibit
only the normal dispersion about their mean luminosities, and the
behavior suggests that the systematic effects of absorption on these
particular stars are either negligible or curiously uniform. The ques-
tion of absorption is important and deserves further investigation,
for it is one of the factors involved in the precise determination of
the distance of the nebula. At present the effect is ignored in the
calculations but is recognized as an uncertainty which operates in a
specific direction.

STAR CLOUDS AND OPEN CLUSTERS

The upper limit of stellar luminosities in M31 is probably of the
order of M=—6, or somewhat fainter than the corresponding limit
in the galactic system. Stars brighter than M=—5 are not numerous,
but thereafter the numbers increase rapidly with diminishing lumi-
nosity as would be expected in a great stellar system. The distribu-
tion of the supergiants (the only stars which can be studied individu-
ally) follows the spiral arms much as, in our own system, they follow
the Milky Way. Star clouds are conspicuous; one, for instance, was
listed in the early catalogs as a separate nebula, NGC206. Open
clusters are also found, and in at least one case a typical A-type
spectrum has been recorded. Emission nebulosities (of the type of
the Orion nebula) have not been recognized; but such objects are
known to be a characteristic feature of later type spirals, and their
absence in M31 is expected.

CEPHEIDS

Three types of objects have been found in large numbers and
studied in some detail, namely, Cepheid variables, novae, and globular
clusters. The first Cepheid was discovered in 1923; systematic
144 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

investigations during the next 5 years increased the number to 40,
and a dozen or more have since been added to the list. The light-
curves are typical and the periods, with one outstanding exception
(P=175 days), range from 48 to 10 days. The data exhibit the fa-
miliar relation between periods and mean, or maximum, luminosities—
the famous period-luminosity relation—by virtue of which the
Cepheids furnish the best available criterion of great distances.
Wherever we find Cepheids, their periods indicate their intrinsic
luminosities (candlepowers) and, consequently, their apparent faint-
ness measures their distances. For instance, the known Cepheids in
M31, as indicated by their periods, average about 1,800 times as
bright as the sun, but they appear about 200,000 times fainter than
the faintest stars seen with the naked eye.

The distance of M31 would be rather accurately determined by
this method if it were not for the uncertain effects of obscuration,
both in the galactic system and in the spiral. The main body of the
galactic system appears to be embedded in a widespread, tenuous
medium (often called the uniform layer), and, of course, many clouds
of dust and gas are scattered through the system, concentrating
toward the fundamental plane of the Milky Way. From our posi-
tion within the system, and close to the galactic plane, we observe
distant nebulae through the surrounding haze and between the
obscuring clouds. The absorption is greatest in and near the Milky
Way, and diminishes toward the galactic poles. But the effects are
not strictly uniform as we look around the sky at a given galactic
latitude, and the calculated corrections, at present, represent average
values which may not be precise for a particular direction.

Now M31 is seen near the edge of the Milky Way at latitude 20°.
The average obscuration at this latitude is about 0.48 magnitude (55
percent) but the proper correction might be considerably different.
Actually, the large numbers of very faint, distant nebulae found in the
vicinity of M31 suggest that the region is more transparent than nor-
mal. A cloud, or real aggregation of the background nebulae, would
produce the same phenomenon, and it is quite possible that both effects
are present. However, an examination of the data leads to the pro-
visional conclusion that abnormal transparency is the dominating
factor, and, consequently, the effect will be partially compensated by
minor obscuration within the spiral. These remarks sufficiently
indicate that the precise effect of obscuration is an unsolved problem.
For the present, it is advisable to apply the average correction for
galactic latitude, and to recognize an uncertainty of the order of 10
to 25 percent in the resulting distance.

The direct procedure is then to compare the many Cepheids in M31
with those in the Small Magellanic Cloud which serves as a unit of
extragalactic distance. Taking account of the average galactic ob-
THE NATURE OF THE NEBULAE—HUBBLE 145

scuration in the two directions, we find that the Cepheids in M31
average about 4.3 magnitudes fainter than Cepheids with correspond-
ing periods in the Cloud. Therefore, the relative distances are about
7.2 to 1. Since the current value for the distance of the Cloud is
95,000 light-years, the distance of the spiral is about 700,000 light-
years, subject to the previously mentioned uncertainty.

NORMAL NOVAE

About 120 normal novae have been discovered in M31 during the
past 21 years. The record is by no means complete, for an analysis
of the well-observed seasons suggests that the frequency is of the order
of 25 to 30 per year. These novae form a very homogeneous group;
their light curves are more or less similar over the regions that can be
observed, and the dispersion about the mean luminosities at corres-
ponding stages is remarkably small.

A discussion of the data some 10 years ago suggested a mean
luminosity at maximum of the order of M=—5.7 with a dispersion of
about 0.5 magnitude. The mean light-curve for the first month after
maximum appeared to be approximately linear with a slope of the
order of 0.05 magnitude per day. Spectra of two novae, obtained by
Humason in 1932, exhibited the familiar features of normal novae in
the galactic system.

The general similarity to galactic novae is pronounced, but a detailed
comparison of maximum luminosities leads to discrepancies. Galactic
novae, as a class, are systematically brighter by more than a magni-
tude. Moreover, several cases are known—e. g., Nova Aquilae (1918),
Nova Persei (1901), T Scorpii (1860)—where the maxima were of the
order of M=—9, which would be highly improbable on the basis of
the small dispersion about the mean maximum derived in M31.

The study of galactic novae, as a class, is subject to effects of se-
lection which favor the brighter objects, and to difficulties of measur-
ing individual distances. For these reasons, it was hoped that the
group characteristics could be determined in the neighboring spiral,
and the results used in the interpretation of observations within the
galactic system. The procedure cannot be followed unless the two
groups of novae are known to be strictly comparable. Thus the ap-
parent discrepancies assumed unusual importance; they indicated
either intrinsic differences between the groups or errors in the inter-
pretation of the available data, and no progress was possible until the
question was settled.

Quite recently, my colleague, Dr. Baade, has found a solution in the
latter alternative. Observations of M31 with large reflectors were
necessarily made only a few days in each month, and most of the
novae were discovered at some unknown interval after maximum.
The mean light-curve*was ‘constructed on the simple assumption that
146 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

maxima occurred midway in the unobserved intervals preceding dis-
coveries. By restricting the data to unobserved intervals less than a
month, it was possible to use a large number of novae and derive a
mean point on the light-curve at about 15 days after maximum, and a
short section of the curve in either direction. The mean maximum
was then derived by extrapolating this segment of the light-curve on
the assumption of a constant slope (of the order of 0.05 magnitude per
day).

Baade, examining the best available photographic light-curves of
galactic novae, found that the luminosities faded rapidly during the
first few days, then more and more slowly until, by 3 weeks or so after
maximum, the slopes were comparable with those observed in M31.
He pointed out that the two groups of novae should properly be com-
pared in the most reliable section of the mean light-curves rather than
at maximum where the data in the spiral are few and unsatisfactory.
If the comparison is made at 20 days, the two curves agree fairly well
over a short range, and the extrapolation to maximum luminosity can
be made on the basis of the well-determined curve for galactic novae.
The procedure leads to a mean maximum in the spiral at M=—6.7 to
—7, depending on the method of weighting the data, in excellent agree-
ment with current values for galactic novae. Moreover, the brighter
novae seem to fade more rapidly than the fainter, and such acorrela-
tion would evidently increase the dispersion about the mean maximum
suggested by the incomplete data for the spiral.

Thus the outstanding discrepancies are removed. We can state
with some confidence that the relative luminosities of novae and
Cepheids agree with those known in the galactic system, well within
the uncertainties of the observations. Novae in the two systems
appear to be strictly comparable, and occasional maxima of M=—9
are readily accounted for as random deviations from the statistical
mean.

SUPERNOVAE

Another type of nova in M31 is represented by the famous star of
1885, S Andromeda, which reached a maximum of the order of
M=-—15, or twice the total luminosity of the average stellar system.
The outburst occurred before the days of the spectrograph, and the
many descriptions of the visual observations must be read in the light
of information derived from the photographic study of similar stars
made during the past year. It now appears that S Andromeda was
a typical example of the rare, spectacular supernovae which form a
well-defined group of objects quite different from any others known
to astronomy. Supernovae represent the sudden release of energy
on a tremendous scale, and their unique spectra offer problems whose
solution should furnish information of a new kind.
THE NATURE OF THE NEBULAE—HUBBLE 147

The outbursts occur with a frequency of the general order of one per
stellar system per several (possibly four or five) centuries. The fre-
quency in giant nebulae, such as M31 and our own galactic system, is
presumably greater than the average, and, consequently, we might
expect to find records of several examples scattered through the
history of the last 2,000 years. Plausible instances have been assem-
bled (for example, a nova outburst in 1054, whose remnants are
probably now observed in the Crab nebula, and Tycho’s nova of 1572),
but in general it is not possible to establish specific, individual cases.

GLOBULAR CLUSTERS

A large number of objects have been found in M31 which, from
their forms, structures, colors, and spectra, have been provisionally
identified as globular clusters, although no individual stars can be
seen. The 140 known objects form a homogeneous group in which
the intrinsic luminosities range from M=—4.7 to —7 and thus
exhibit a relatively small dispersion around the mean value, which is
about —5.3.

That globular clusters in the galactic system also form a homo-
geneous group is indicated by Shapley’s classical investigation of their
distances. When his peculiar scale of total luminosities (which he
humorously calls convenient rather than conventional) is corrected,
the absolute magnitudes range from about —5 to —9, with an ex-
ceptional cluster, Omega Centauri at —9.8. The mean value is
near —7.3.

Thus the two groups overlap to a considerable extent, but the
clusters in the galactic system are systematically brighter than those
in the spiral by about two magnitudes. The discrepancy is fully
established, and represents an intrinsic difference in the group char-
acteristics. The brightest of the objects in M31 is fainter than the
mean of the galactic globular clusters. The discrepancy, however, is
not so disturbing as that formerly presumed in the case of the novae,
because globular clusters are known in the Magellanic Clouds, and
they also appear to be systematically fainter than the galactic objects—
comparable, in fact, to the objects in M31. Moreover, similar objects
are recognized in several of the nearer nebulae, and the average lumi-
nosities vary from system to system. These considerations detract
from the value of globular clusters as criteria of distances, but they
suggest a new field of investigation, namely, the comparative study
of the group characteristics of globular clusters in different environ-
ments.

Unlike the clusters in the galactic system, which are believed to
exhibit a spherical distribution, those in M31 follow the flattened,
lens-shaped distribution of the general luminosity. The novae

1147283911
148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

follow the same pattern; they may appear anywhere in the nebula but
are most frequent in the bright, unresolved nuclear region. Cepheids,
on the contrary, follow the complementary distribution of the super-
giants; they favor the spiral arms and tend to avoid the nuclear region.

These notes, which omit many individual features of the triple
nebula in Andromeda, and almost the whole of a considerable body of
spectrographic data, are yet sufficient for our purpose. The nearest
of the neighboring spirals stands forth as a great, independent stellar
system, an island universe, separated from our own system by a vast
stretch of appreciably empty space. If we were in that nebula, and
looked back across that space, the system of the Milky Way presum-
ably would resemble the actual appearance of M31 in its dimensions
and in many of its structural features.

As our explorations sweep outward, we recognize countless other
members of this same family. They are the true inhabitants of the
universe. The nearer systems appear large and bright. Then we
find them smaller and fainter in constantly increasing numbers, and
we know we are reaching out into space farther and ever farther until,
at the extreme limit of our telescopes, we reach the last outposts of the
observable region of the universe. With the 100-inch reflector, the
great spiral in Andromeda could still be recognized as a nebula if it
were so remote that its light had to travel for a thousand million years
to make the journey.

THE SUN AND THE ATMOSPHERE!

By Haruan T. STETSON
Massachusetts Institute of Technology

[With three plates]

The subject assigned me for this evening is peculiarly gratifying,
for there is a new emphasis being placed upon the importance of
science to human welfare. Certainly of the cosmic elements neces-
sary for our well-being, no two are more vital to us than the sun’s
radiation and the atmosphere we breathe.

As we all know, the earth’s atmosphere consists of nearly one-
quarter oxygen, three-quarters nitrogen, a sprinkling of carbon
dioxide, with a bit of seasoning of the noble condiments of argon,
neon, crypton, xenon, and a trace of helium. Here at the earth’s
surface, we can count on a little more than 1 percent of moisture in
the form of water vapor to prevent the complete desiccation of acad-
emicians and others. For a thorough mixing of these elements of
the atmosphere and the maintenance of its temperature as well as
the variations of its temperature, we rely upon the sun. Rarely
more vividly have we had impressed upon us the relationship of our
atmosphere to the sun as a part of our cosmic environment than
has been evidenced lately by some magnificent displays of the North-
ern Lights. Flaming gorgeously red, a hundred or more miles high,
like neon signs they advertise the lofty air, swarming with the traffic
of electrons, ions, and particles, all jostling one another as they are
stimulated by radiations from the sun during a period of great sun-
spot activity.

If we look at the sun through a telescope, we see a gaseous globe
approximately one million times the size of the earth in volume with
a hot radiating surface of about 6,000° C. in temperature and fre-
quently, as on the day when this photograph (pl. 1) was taken, be-
sprinkled with dark patches that are called sunspots. From watching
the motion of these spots, we learn that the sun rotates about an axis.
This rotation is not uniform but is most rapid at the equator where
one rotation is completed in about 25 days. Halfway between the
equator and the poles, observations indicate 3 extra days are con-
sumed in a single rotation.

150 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

We need scarcely remind a Washington audience that through
the long painstaking investigations of Dr. Abbot, Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, the amount of energy that the sun pours
forth has been measured with such precision that we not only know
the average quantity of heat and light emitted but that this average
varies from time to time to the extent of some 2 or 3 percent. Ex-
pressed in engineering language, we can say that the earth’s share of
the sun’s output is in the neighborhood of 450 million million horse-
power. Because of its relatively insignificant size and because also
of the great distance that separates the earth from the sun, a distance
of 93 million miles, our planet intercepts but one two-billionth of this
total solar output. Even so, if we stop to consider what the cost
to the earth would be were we charged for a year’s service of heat
and light from the Solar Utilities Power and Light Company, we
would find our indebtedness mounting to staggering proportions.
At a price of 1% cents per kilowatt-hour, the annual budget that
would have to be allowed for sunshine for the United States alone
would aggregate a total of 327 quadrillion dollars.

Of course such large figures as quadrillions are indeed difficult to
picture. If we restrict our interest for the moment to the City of
New York alone, we find that the cost of sunshine for Greater New
York for just one day amounts to 100 million dollars.

Knowing how much of the sun’s energy strikes the earth and the
small proportional amount which the latter intercepts, one can easily
calculate the total output from the Solar Power House. It is 380,000,-
000,000,000,000,000,000 kilowatts. The solar dynamos are evidently
running at full-tilt and giving continuous service.

Life on the earth during the past, present, and future so depends
for its well-being upon this constant amount of sunshine that we
may well be interested in how long the Solar Power Company can
remain solvent and how long it can continue to operate while human
beings inhabit the earth. Meanwhile, we are impressed with the
apparent waste of the sun’s natural resources so far as any use by man-
kind is concerned. Fortunately for us, millions of years ago sunshine
provided the energy for growing the vast tropical forests of the Car-
boniferous era. It is the carbon in those fallen tree trunks that we
are mining today in the form of coal, the chief source of fuel for our
own public utilities. Thus nature has stored in those primitive
forests buried underground unthinkable calories of canned sunshine
that brightens our highways and illuminates our buildings during the
long nights when the sun is below the horizon. So the sunshine of
the past is being brought literally to light again. Even the ultraviolet
light in our health lamps is again directly traceable to the sunshine
sg those days when the dinosaurs roamed through the vast tropical

orests.

THE SUN AND THE ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 15l

If we live where we obtain our electric current from utility com-
panies operating solely by water power, we do not dodge the issue of
our debt to the Solar Power Company. The radiation from the sun
transforms the water of the oceans, lakes, and streams into the
ascending water vapor that condenses into clouds and falls in rain,
feeding mountain streams, and rivers that turn the giant turbines
of the hydroelectric plants. A fair estimate of the amount of water
evaporated and precipitated in rainfall in 1 year is 480 million million
tons. To carry on this gigantic irrigation enterprise requires the
expenditure of 1,000 million horsepower continuously throughout
the year, yet only a very small amount of solar energy is consumed
in running this rain-making machinery.

How long the Solar Power Company can continue to operate
depends upon its source of supply, and to answer this question we
must avail ourselves of the best guesses of science. Dismissing as
utterly inadequate earlier hypotheses, our best guess now is that the
chief source of energy is within the atoms of which the sun is composed.
The two simplest atoms about which we know anything are those of
hydrogen and helium. Hydrogen is the highly explosive gas which
was the cause of the Hindenburg disaster, and helium is the inert
nonexplosive gas which those responsible for this giant airliner would
have liked to have substituted for hydrogen, could they have obtained
it. Four hydrogen atoms constitute the necessary building material
for one helium atom with just a bit of energy left over.

It appears probable that within the hot interior of the sun the trans-
mutation of hydrogen into helium is continually taking place, thus
releasing an enormous amount of heat from the surplus energy left
over from each combination of four hydrogen atoms as they form one
helium atom. Every time such a transmutation takes place one per-
cent of the weight of the materials involved is liberated as energy.
On such an hypothesis the sun could have well kept up its present
state of radiation from as far back in geologic time as we have any
reason to consider. Of course the sun is constantly losing weight in
the process. The loss of weight has been calculated to be 4,200,000
tons every second, but we scarcely need worry about the fuel supply
being exhausted while the sun still has about 2,000,000,000,000,000,-
000,000,000,000 tons of matter left in it!

Passing over reminders of our indebtedness for the various services
the sun renders, we shall come to see that we are quite as much
interested in analyzing the kinds of radiation that the sun sends out
as we are in the total amount of energy received. When we analyze
this radiation we discover that it covers a wide range of frequencies
or wave lengths. It seems probable that each of these wave lengths
or frequencies renders a special kind of service to the earth and its
atmosphere.
152 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

We are all familiar with the fact that if sunlight is split into its
component colors by means of a spectroscope we can see a large variety
of the radiations represented by the various parts or colors of the solar
spectrum. The visible range to which the eye responds represents
frequencies extending from 400 million million cycles per second to a
frequency just about double this, or 800 million million cycles per
second. The sensation of the higher of these two frequencies is that of
violet light, and the sensation produced by the 400 million million cycle
frequency is that of deep red light. In between these two extremes
of the spectrum fall the intervening colors. But outside this so-called
visible range to which the eye responds there is a vast scale of radia-
tions both beyond the red end of the spectrum which we call the
infrared and far down below the violet which we call the ultraviolet.

By means of the photographic plate, we can extend the map of the
spectrum in either direction. Far out beyond the red end are heat
radiations from the sun that may be measured with the thermopile or
the bolometer. It was during the days of Dr. Samuel Pierpont
Langley, a predecessor of Dr. Abbot as Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, that a very complete and careful survey of the radiations
from the sun was carried out, extending into the infrared. Today
much research is being done in measuring the extremely short waves,
or high-frequency radiations out beyond the violet, for the ultraviolet
is coming to have increasing importance not only from the point of
view of health but from the point of view of the radio engineer.

It is undoubtedly the impact of these very short waves or high-
frequency radiations upon the top of the atmosphere that is responsi-
ble for its ionization that makes possible all our radio communication.
Fortunately for us, most of the ultraviolet light is stopped in the upper
atmosphere owing to the presence of a small amount of ozone which
acts as an absorbing screen to these high-frequency radiations. If the
ozone in the upper air were reduced to standard atmospheric condi-
tions at the earth’s surface, it would form a layer scarcely more than
2 millimeters thick. Through the 2-millimeter layer a sufficient amount
of ultraviolet still seeps through to the earth’s surface to produce the
necessary vitamins for our well-being. Were this ozone layer absent,
on the other hand, it would be quite impossible for us to survive under
the extremely short wave-length radiations that would penetrate to
the earth’s surface.

Thus, we see it is the combination of both the sun and our atmos-
phere that makes life on the earth possible. The sun not only
radiates health-giving sunshine but it also radiates death-dealing rays.
Were it not for the protecting shield of the earth’s atmosphere, the
sun would be the death of all of us. The atmosphere, then, provides
us, on the one hand, with oxygen for maintaining life, and on the other
hand, shields us from the highly penetrating rays from the sun that
THE SUN AND THE ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 15

are dangerous in the extreme. The atmosphere is a sort of buffer
state, the very top of which receives a violent bombardment of high
frequency radiations from the sun that is prevented from reaching
the surface of the earth by the absorbing power of the molecules of
gases contained init. Up where this bombardment occurs, we witness
the auroral displays, such as the brilliant occurrences of last January.
These displays are in reality electrical discharges in the thin atmos-
phere occurring at the active front where are received the heavy
artillery of corpuscles, electrons, and radiations which fall upon it
from space outside and for which the sun appears to be chiefly
responsible.

It is this blanket of atmosphere that enables the earth to retain
during the night much of the warmth generated by the sunshine
falling upon it during the day, thus preventing the temperature of
the earth from falling to extremely low temperatures during the
hours of darkness.

Though the effective atmosphere is many miles thick, when com-
pared to the size of the earth itself it is but a thin shell, hardly more
than the thickness of the paper upon which the map is printed on a
desk globe compared to the size of the globe itself.

If we look at a cross-section of the earth’s atmosphere, it may for
convenience be divided into three zones or layers in which the strato-
sphere occupies the middle ground. The region below the stratosphere
is that which contacts our immediate surroundings and provides the
winds and atmospheric currents, giving rise to all our weather. We
call this lower region comprising perhaps the first 5 or 6 miles the
troposphere. The region above the stratosphere is the ionosphere.
If we send a recording thermometer aloft, we find that while passing
through the troposphere the temperature steadily falls until a height
of 10 or 12 kilometers is reached, when the temperature reaches the
extremely low value of —55° C., or some 68° below zero Fahrenheit.
Strangely enough, for the next 30 miles or so there appears to be little
change in temperature. ‘This is the region of the stratosphere. The
weather forecaster for the stratosphere would have a relatively simple
task, for day after day, year in and year out, his prognostications
would be “clear and cool,” and his forecasts would be 100 percent
correct. Ata height of 60 kilometers or some 40 miles, the tempera-
ture would begin to rise again. Recent investigations give some
evidence that at extreme heights, up where the auroral fires play,
temperatures of 1,000° C. have to be postulated to account for the
presence of the oxygen that is there. The extremely rarefied condi-
tion of this upper atmosphere, however, calls for perhaps a quite
different interpretation of temperature than that to which we are
ordinarily accustomed when determining temperatures by the ther-
mometer at the earth’s surface.
154 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

Ascending through the cross-sections of the atmosphere, we find
there is a rapid decrease in the amount of atmospheric pressure.
Within the first 3 miles from the earth’s surface, half the total amount
of oxygen and nitrogen, the principal atmospheric ingredients, are
included. The limiting height to which the thinning atmosphere
extends is somewhat difficult to fix. Perhaps we should place it at
400 or 500 miles, although recently Dr. Carl Stérmer has observed
auroral streamers reaching to heights of 600 miles or more. Where
auroral streamers go, some of the thin atmosphere must extend.

Through the courtesy of the Smithsonian Institution we have
provided for us here? a piece of apparatus from which the air can
be exhausted so that we can gradually simulate conditions that
would be encountered were we to board an imaginary balloon and
ascend upward. To apply such electric potentials as appear to
exist aloft, there are two electrodes entering this glass tube at either
end and a high voltage is applied across these terminals. Under the
standard atmospheric conditions of this room which is now the
condition inside the tube, you see there is no evidence of a passage
of electricity. Air under ordinary conditions is a relatively good
nonconductor. If, however, I now start the vacuum pump going
and begin to exhaust the air from this closed tube, the pressure will
be gradually reduced and we shall soon see the beginning of an illumi-
nation as an electric current passes through the rarefied air from one
end of the tube to the other. The color already simulates the red
tints of the aurorae. As the vacuum in this tube increases, we
imagine ourselves rising higher and higher through the stratosphere.
We note the changing form of the electrical discharge and the pale
blue color that now occurs as the ionization of the thinning air in the
tube becomes more complete. The glow is dimming now as we are
attaining the equivalent altitude of some 400 or 500 miles. At this
imaginary height the air molecules are becoming scarce. The artificial
auroral glow is dimming. Now it has ceased altogether for the
vacuum obtained is too nearly complete for current to pass longer.
We are at the very top. Now shutting off the pump we will throw
a little valve here, and gradually admit the air from the room again.
In our imaginary flight our gallant gondola is now descending. Watch
for the first appearances of the auroral glow. There it is—first pale
blue, gradually increasing in intensity as we rapidly descend to
greater densities of the air. Once again we see the pink striations.
We are coming rapidly into the stratosphere. Now come the irregular
discharges characteristic of the denser regions. The glow dims and
disappears once more. We have fallen rapidly down to full atmos-
pheric pressure again where the air becomes nonconducting and the
discharge has ceased.

THE SUN AND THE ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 155

This is an illustration of the way in which aurorae are formed in
the upper atmosphere of the earth under the electrical excitation
that appears to be caused by the sun’s radiation as molecules of
oxygen and nitrogen are ionized in the regions where the pressure
is very low.

If we make a chart of the numbers and occurrences of these aurorae
we find there seems to be a curious connection between the frequency
and brightness of auroral displays and the state of the sun as marked
by the appearance of sunspots. Professor Brooks, Director of the
Blue Hill Observatory, has kindly allowed me access to the records
made of aurorae at that station for the last 30 years. Utilizing the
observations of the brighter aurorae, we have here a graph showing
the variations in auroral frequencies occurring in years distributed
with respect to the maximum occurrences of sunspots. The fewest

number of aurorae appear to occur from 4 to 6 years before or after
the years marking sunspot maxima. ‘The time when aurorae appear
most frequently would seem to be about 2 years after the passing of
the maximum of sunspots. The very high column occurring 1 year
before sunspot maximum is due largely to an unusually large number
of observations in 1893. These results corroborate rather well
those of a longer series of observations tabulated by Dr. Chree extend-
ing for over 100 years, or from 1750 to 1877.

The fact that aurorae therefore appear to occur with greater fre-
quency at the times when sunspots are most numerous suggests an
electrical effect in the upper atmosphere for which sunspots may be
responsible. Much of our present knowledge of aurorae is due to the
exhaustive studies and mathematical calculations of Dr. Stérmer of
Blindern, Norway. By careful analysis of the motion of charged par-
ticles in the magnetic field of the earth he has been able to deduce
tracks of ionization so simulating auroral forms as to indicate very
156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

significantly that such discharges in the upper atmosphere are indeed
the result of bombardments of electrons coming in from outside,
warped by the magnetic field of the earth. In endeavoring to express
such phenomena on an electronic hypothesis we may well look at the
sun, therefore, for a consideration of the character of sunspots and
to trace any possible mechanism by which corpuscular charges might
be ejected in the regions of the sunspots themselves.

When we look at an enlarged view of a sunspot and analyze the
light from it we find that the dark interior center is surrounded by a
turbulent area. A photograph taken in the light emitted by hydrogen
at one particular frequency reveals that here are whirling masses of
gas, arranging themselves in veritable vortices. There is every indi-
cation, then, that a sunspot is in reality a terrific solar hurricane. It
was in 1908 that the late Dr. George Ellery Hale, the founder and
director of the Mount Wilson Observatory, first observed that sun-
spots were giant cyclones in the sun’s atmosphere. They are indeed
very similar in their formation to the tropical hurricanes that originate
in the West Indies and sweep northward.

An ordinary telescope would never have disclosed all this about
sunspots. With a special contrivance of his own invention called the
spectroheliograph he was able to photograph the sun, utilizing the
light of a given frequency from one chemical element at a time. The
spectroheliograph is a sort of a combination of a spectroscope and a
moving plate arrangement, somewhat similar to a motion picture
outfit in its operation. With this device it is possible to photograph
the distribution of clouds of chemicals whose presence in the sun’s
atmosphere is betrayed by the lines in the spectrum. Since the
invention of the spectroscope it has been known that hydrogen and
calcium, for example, are very conspicuous elements entering into
the sun’s makeup.

With photographic emulsions made especially sensitive to the red
light emitted by hydrogen Dr. Hale photographed on a moving film
the entire solar surface so far as it was covered by bright luminous
hydrogen clouds. The resulting representations of the sun appeared
very different from photographs made in ordinary light. Not only
were large clouds of hydrogen gas discernible all over the sun, but in
the neighborhood of sunspots they seemed to be swept into the heart of
the spot as though they were caught in the center of a whirlpool.
Pictures of sunspots taken in this way show the same kind of vortex
as one often sees when a basin is being emptied of water by the sudden
removal of a drain plug at the bottom of the bowl. Such an appear-
ance might be presented by the top of a terrestrial cyclone or tornado
if photographed from a stratospheric balloon. The dark center of the
spot forms the center of the vortex; the outlying shaded region that
characterizes the so-called penumbra of the sunspot would represent
THE SUN AND THE ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 157

the turbulence bordering upon the central funnel about which the
atmospheric particles are rapidly rotating. Thus we see there is a
close analogy between the meteorology of tropical cyclones and that
of sunspots. To carry the analogy still further, spots north of the
sun’s equator are in general whirling in one direction while corre-
sponding spots south of the equator whirl in the opposite direction.
If the rotation of the one is clockwise, that of the other is counter-
clockwise. This again is characteristic of the differences of rotation
of tropical hurricanes on the earth originating in the northern and
southern hemispheres, respectively.

Had it not been for the trick of splitting up sunlight into isolated
frequencies by means of the spectroscope, we should never have had
pictures showing the existence of solar vortices such as we have today.
In the ordinary photograph of the sun, the light emitted by every
chemical element in the sun’s atmosphere is clamoring to tell its
story. The result is revealed in a rather jumbled picture of what is
happening on the sun. The spots show up as dark regions only when
the light-emitting power of every element of the sun is damaged in
the vicinity of these violently disturbed regions.

The spectroscope is very much like a highly selective radio receiving
set. The sun is a high-powered station sending out light, broadcast
in all the wave lengths and frequencies. When we look at the sun
or photograph it with a telescope alone, we are using all of the light
and are, so to speak, operating a radio receiver which admits all fre-
quencies at once. Thus we get a composite but very jumbled picture
of what is happening on the sun’s surface so far as details are con-
cerned. By means of the spectroscope, however, the photographic
apparatus, to continue our analogy, may be tuned to a single fre-
quency such as the 470 million megacycle frequency that the red line
of hydrogen emits. Tuned to this frequency, the spectroscope stills
the tumult of all other elements and lets hydrogen tell its own story.
It is then that we obtain the clear photographs conveying so beauti-
fully the detailed information about the vortical whirls around the
solar storm centers that would otherwise be lost in the jumble of too
many story-tellers.

At about the same time another brilliant discovery due to Dr.
Hale came from the Mount Wilson Observatory. It had long been
known that the frequencies of light waves were distorted if there were
a powerful magnetic field at the light source. This had been demon-
strated in the laboratory shortly after the reason for such a phenomenon
had been given by Zeeman in 1894. When the Mount Wilson ob-
servers examined and actually measured the frequency of light coming
from the centers of sunspots, it was found to have changed frequency
in exactly the way that light waves are distorted in the laboratory
when a powerful electromagnet is placed around the source of light
158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

being examined. If additional proof were needed for the explanation
of the changed frequencies, it may be stated that the double and triple
lines found in the spectrum of sunspots indicated that the light was
polarized just as in the case of the polarized light waves coming from
the laboratory source upon which the magnetic field is impressed.
Thus came the startling revelation that sunspots were not only terrific
hurricanes but every center was in itself a powerful magnet. Since a
magnetic field may exert a repulsing effect upon swiftly moving elec-
trons, we see some reason that charged electric particles can be actu-
ally hurled from sunspot centers at velocities which may carry them
through space into the earth’s atmosphere, thus ionizing the upper
regions of the air in a way that would produce auroral displays. In
the light of such a mechanism, therefore, we see a possible reason why
aurorae occur in greater numbers and at greater brilliance at times
when these solar storms occur most frequently.

Curiously enough, for nearly 300 years it has been known that the
direction of the compass needle and the intensity of the earth’s mag-
netic field appear also to be affected by sunspots, for in the year when

FIGURE 2.—Sunspots and variations in earth’s magnetism fluctuate together through the years.

sunspots are most numerous, magnetic disturbances are most fre-
quent and appear with marked intensity.

If we examine a graph representing the sunspot numbers for the
last 100 years, we become aware of the close parallelism between these
magnetic variations on the earth and the variations in the numbers of
sunspots. Furthermore, it will be evident that the years when sun-
spots are most numerous follow with more or less regularity an interval
of somewhat over a decade between the times of maximum sunspot
activity. This solar cycle, or sunspot period as we sometimes call it,
is usually conceded to be on the average of about 11.3 years duration.
But an examination of the graph will show that sometimes the inter-
val between maxima is as little as 9 years and on one occasion was as
great as 17 years. We appear now to be in the midst of the period of
maximum activity of the present cycle.

The source and nature of the earth’s magnetism is still one of the
great mysteries of science. Although the close parallelism between
magnetic changes on the earth and the appearance and disappearance
of sunspots has been recognized for many years, it was not until the
THE SUN AND THE ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 159

discovery of the magnetic character of sunspots themselves by Dr.
Hale and the more recent discovery of an ionized region in the upper
atmosphere of the earth that any real explanation appeared as to why
sunspots and changes in the earth’s magnetic field should show so
close a parallelism.

Everyone knows in a general way that the earth is a magnetic
sphere. That the compass needle does not point true north except in
various restricted parts of the globe is also a fact which is generally
recognized. Perhaps comparatively few people realize, however, that
the compass needle is constantly wandering back and forth every day
by a slight amount. When the sun rises in the east, the north end of
the compass needle turns slightly toward that direction. By noon
when the sun is south, it is pointed in its normal position. Then in
the afternoon as the sun wanders and sets in the west, the compass
needle wanders likewise to the west, coming back again to its normal
position about midnight when the sun is below the northern horizon.
This goes on day after day, month after month—but during the years
when sunspots are most numerous these daily excursions of the com-
pass needle will on the average be twice as great as during the years
when sunspots are lacking. These diurnal wanderings of the compass
needle can now be roughly explained as due to the effects of ionization
of the upper atmosphere by sunlight. As the electric charges become
separated in the process of ionization of the molecules of nitrogen and
oxygen under the bombardment of ultraviolet light from the sun, the
movements of these ions create a perceptible current, deflecting the
compass needle from its normal magnetic position. We may infer,
therefore, that at times of sunspot maxima the number of these ions
in the upper air is materially increased, producing a more marked
magnetic effect. The strength of the magnetic field of the earth, there-
fore, may be considered as increasing and decreasing with the variation
in the intensity of the ionization of the upper air that changes with
sunspot occurrences. Most of our knowledge of the ionized region
has come about through the invention of radio.

In the early days of wireless, it was thought that electric waves
which carried telegraph messages without wires traveled in straight
lines over the earth, just as light waves do. With this conception one
could never hope to communicate over very great distances, since the
curvature of the earth would prevent the passage of the waves as the
earth’s huge hulk bulged into the communication path. The earlier
wireless engineers thought that only by building higher and higher
antenna towers could one ultimately hope to communicate over the
thousands of miles that would make transoceanic wireless possible.

How amusing such a picture appears when today any one of us can
turn the knob on our short-wave sets and bring in broadcasts from
London, Rome, or Berlin. Of course, these early crude notions about
160 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

the way in which electric waves travel were erroneous. Such, never-
theless, is the way in which science has groped into the unknown.
Somebody experimenting with wireless and listening in found himself
quite unconsciously eavesdropping on Marconi waves from far-away
Europe. Instantly the thought about how wireless waves travel had
to be changed. Evidently the ether waves followed the curvature of
the earth and did not travel in straight lines after all. This led Pro-
fessor Kennelly of Harvard to postulate that there must exist high
above the earth’s surface, perhaps 100 miles or so up, an electrified
conducting layer from which the electromagnetic waves emitted from
the powerful antennae were reflected back to earth. The earth’s
upper atmosphere, therefore, in his mind formed a conducting layer
and imprisoned the radio waves between the earth’s surface and space
outside. A few months after Professor Kennelly published his idea,
the English scientist, Oliver Heaviside, announced a similar conclusion
quite independently. In honor of these two distinguished men this
upper region of the earth’s atmosphere that is electrically ionized is
commonly referred to as the Kennelly-Heaviside layer, also designated
as the E layer.

If we look at a diagram (pl. 2) which presents a vertical section of
the earth and its atmosphere, we see that this Kennelly-Heaviside layer
exists at an altitude of from 80-100 kilometers. Radio waves emitted
from a sending station in all directions arriving in this ionized region
have their velocity and direction changed as they penetrate further
and further into the region, until at length they are bent back to
earth again, reaching receiving stations hundreds and sometimes
thousands of miles from the source whence they were broadcast. This
region lies far above the stratosphere and generally above the region
that is usually regarded as that where ozone is manufactured. This
E layer is particularly favorable for reflecting or turning back radio
waves of the frequencies which are most generally used for commer-
cial broadcasting in connection with our entertainment programs.
Radio waves of much shorter wave lengths or of higher frequencies
penetrate and actually traverse through this region until they reach
what appears to be another ionized region called the F layer originally
postulated by Professor Appleton of England. This F layer lies some
200 kilometers high or in the territory where auroral streamers stage
their gorgeous displays. If the ionization of these upper regions is
more intense as we near the period of maximum sunspot activity, one
might well expect that some change might be observed in connection
with radio transmission.

Anticipating a new field of research, a Boston radio engineer, Mr.
G. W. Pickard, and myself became interested in the making of quan-
titative measurements of radio reception during the last sunspot
maximum of 1928 in an endeavor to discover if such anticipated effects
THE SUN AND THE ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 161

on radio communication could be measured. After a few years’
observations, it appeared to be evident that when solar activity de-
creased, the field strength of a Chicago broadcasting station observed
in Boston notably weakened, whereas as sunspots became less numer-
ous there was a marked increase in the intensity of the radio waves
from Chicago. A similar investigation carried on during the decline
of sunspots from 1930 to 1932 between Chicago and the Perkins
Observatory of Delaware, Ohio, yielded data to indicate that with a
decrease of sunspots from a monthly average of 60 at the beginning
of 1930 to a monthly average of about 10 in 1932, radio reception in-
creased six-fold in its intensity.

Let me hasten to point out that this does not necessarily imply a
600 percent decrease in the ionization of the Kennelly-Heaviside layer
over this interval, for it appears probable that a much smaller change
in the percentage of ionization could so appreciably alter the degree
of the angle of reflection at the ionized layer as to increase materially

FiGuRE 3.—Solar activity serves as a basis for predicting quality of radio reception for broadcast frequencies.
The vertical scale represents sunspot numbers.

the strength of a wave of a fixed frequency over a fixed path as re-
ceived at any given point.

Let us take an illustration from the sporting world. Suppose we
were in a squash court and attempted to place a tennis ball at a pre-
determined spot on the court by a serve directed to the ceiling. If we
judiciously direct our serve, we may land the ball at its desired destina-
tion by a reflection from the ceiling of the court. If now, the ceiling
should be raised or lowered by even a relatively small amount, the
same stroke would result in landing the ball far from its mark. Fol-
lowing this analogy, a radio receiver may be at an optimum position
for receiving a broadcast wave reflected from the ionized layer. Let
the ceiling of reflection of this wave be altered either in height or in
its ionic content, thereby increasing or decreasing the ionization present,
and the wave may arrive at the earth so far from our receiver that we
get notably bad reception. The radio, therefore, becomes a sensitive
and extremely useful tool in recording changes of degree of ionization

in the Kennelly layer. When we observe field strengths at long dis-
tances, we are in a way tracing the integration of the effect throughout
the whole transmission path.

Another way in which we gain important information as to the sun’s
effect upon the upper atmosphere is by making radio soundings from
day to day. This method which has been in use for some years at
the National Kureau of Standards, at the Department of Terrestrial
Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution in Washington and elsewhere,
consists of sending up a radio pulse, letting it bounce off the reflecting
layer, come back nearly vertically into a sensitive receiver, and
measuring the time elapsed while the wave was traveling this path
to the ionosphere and back. Assuming that the radio wave travels
with the velocity of light, one can calculate from the elapsed time the
height to which the pulse ascended before it was turned back by the
ionosphere. The method, you see, is very similar to that used at sea
when a sound wave is sent from an oscillator in the ship’s hull to the
ocean bottom and is received back at the microphones of the ship’s
navigating equipment. Knowing the speed with whichisound travels
through water, the ship’s captain can thus determine the ocean depth.
Soundings made in the ionosphere, therefore, reveal different con-
ditions at various times, showing marked changes in the ionic density
dependent upon the hour of the day and the season of the year. This
method of radio soundings is sometimes modified by changing the
frequency at which the radio pulse is emitted. If the frequency is
sufficiently increased, these more penetrating waves may pass com-
pletely through the ionized layer and not return. When such a
frequency is attained, it is known as the critical frequency. Its value
is an important index for studying cosmic effects.

During the last few years of sunspot activity, there have been
occasions when remarkable fadeouts have occurred in radio com-
munication. In several of these instances extraordinary explosions
have occurred on the sun simultaneously with the interruption of all
radio communication in general. A record has been kept by Dr.
Dellinger, at the National Bureau of Standards, of such radio fadeouts
as are reported. In many of these instances observations at the
Mount Wilson Observatory have shown violent solar eruptions taking
place simultaneously. It would appear that the intense ionizing radia-
tion from the region of the sun where these eruptions occur reaches
the earth with the velocity of light and of sufficient intensity to
disturb immediately the ionized layer, confusing the reflection of
radio waves, and thereby resulting in these fadeouts which sometimes
last for an hour or more. Records at magnetic observatories show
that during such instances characteristics of the earth’s magnetic
field are likewise suddenly altered.
THE SUN AND THE ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 163

Could we visualize the ethereal substance of the ionosphere as we
visualize the surface of the ocean, we should find times when terrific
storms were raging in this ionosphere. Here ions and electrons are
being hurled hither and yon as though some great electrical wind
played upon its surface, creating waves literally miles high. Fre-
quently the turbulence attains such proportions that no reflecting
surface for radio communication seems possible at all. When dis-
turbances on the sun subside, the undulations in the ionosphere may
quiet down and there is a return to more normal conditions for com-
munication traffic through this ocean of the upper air.

While knowledge of the sun has helped us to understand the
vagaries of radio, we are coming to see that radio is one of the most
important tools for learning about what happens on the sun and how
disturbances there affect the ions in this upper air. Perhaps some
day, even though the sky is cloudy, we shall have a sufficient number
of reports of radio conditions over the globe so that we can form a
very good idea as to what is happening on the surface of the sun by the
way in which world-wide radio communication behaves. Unlike the
telescope, radio apparatus does not go out of commission when the
sky is overcast, for electric waves, of course, pass through the clouds
as easily as ordinary daylight comes through window glass.

Concerning the exact method or methods by means of which the
sun produces all these electric disturbances of the upper air with the
concomitant magnetic variations in the earth, we still lack a great
deal of knowledge. The fact that the ultraviolet radiation from the
sun is the major factor in producing this ionization appears a reason-
able assumption. Whether or not in addition to the effect of the
ultraviolet light, streams of charged particles also emanate from the
sun in the regions of sunspots is perhaps still debatable. The elab-
orate mathematical work of Dr. Stérmer, in calculating the movements
of hypothetical charged particles from the sun striking the upper
atmosphere of the earth and thereby producing aurorae, would cer-
tainly seem to favor the idea that corpuscular radiation of some sort is
responsible for this phenomenon.

One experimental way by which we might determine the relative
importance of ultraviolet light and corpuscular radiation from the sun,
if such exists, is to observe the radio effects during the phenomenon of
a total eclipse of the sun. Measurements of the Heaviside layer
heights during the eclipse of 1932 revealed a marked change in the
ionization coincident with the arrival of the moon’s shadow. As the
moon passed off the sun and the normal daylight was restored, the
apparent height of the ionized layer again resumed its normal value
through the day.

Chapman has shown that if there is a corpuscular emanation from
the sun affecting the ionosphere and if these corpuscles travel, as
would be surmised, at velocities much slower than those of light, the
effect of the moon in screening off from the earth such a stream of
charged particles should cause disturbances in the ionosphere as much
as 2 hours in advance of the optical shadow. Such an effect was looked
for in the case of the New England eclipse of 1932 but with results that

were far from convincing. Observations at other eclipses have un-
mistakably confirmed the hypothesis of ultraviolet light as a source of
ionization but only conflicting reports are available for any substan-
tiation of a corpuscular or electronic shadow. One difficulty, perhaps,
in detecting the effects of a stream of charged particles or electrons
emanating from the sun or sunspots lies in the fact that the paths of
THE SUN AND THE ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 165

the charged particles would vary very materially from a straight line
as they are distorted, both by any magnetic field which the sun may
possess and by the magnetic field of the earth when the corpuscles or
electrons arrive in the neighborhood of our planet. We should,
therefore, preserve an open mind relative to any corpuscular theory,
for negative evidence is never completely convincing.

It seems hardly necessary to emphasize the desirability of contin-
uing measurements of radiation from the sun such as have been con-
tinued for so many years by the Smithsonian Institution. In con-
nection with measuring the total amount of the sun’s radiation it
appears especially important that systematic measurements of the
ultraviolet in sunshine should form an important part in gaining
information as to the interrelation of the sun and the earth. Daily
measurements of the strength of the ultraviolet in sunshine made by
Pettit at the Mount Wilson Observatory over many years appear to
indicate that in general ultraviolet radiation is more intense near
sunspot maxima than at sunspot minima. There are, however,
many disconcerting discrepancies. A remarkable drop in the ultra-
violet radiation from the sun, for example, occurred in the early part
of 1936 while solar activity was still rising. It must be remarked
that ultraviolet is probably the source of the creation of ozone in the
upper air, and at the same time any increase in the ozone content
naturally screens from the earth’s surface the greater part of this ultra-
violet radiation which produces it. Since ozone, therefore, absorbs
the greater part of the sun’s ultraviolet radiation, it would appear
that with any sudden increase in the ultraviolet there would be a
concomitant increase in the amount of ozone which, in turn, would
effectively reduce the quantity of the ultraviolet light which we would
measure at the earth’s surface. This seriously complicates the prob-
lem, and may account for the fact that a smaller value of the ultra-
violet radiation would actually be recorded by our instruments even
though its emission from the sun at the same time might be enhanced.
Similarly, a sudden dissociation of ozone due to a decrease in the
amount of ultraviolet emitted from the sun might well result in a
sufficient thinning of the ozone layer to allow apparently a material
increase in the amount of ultraviolet coming through the atmosphere
to the earth. Our instruments, therefore, would indicate more ultra-
violet at a time when the sun might actually be emitting less.

When we take averages of ultraviolet radiation over the years and
compare them with solar activity, the correspondence between sun-
spots and ultraviolet radiation is much more striking than any day-
to-day or week-to-week correspondence can exhibit. It would appear
feasible and highly desirable that observations of ultraviolet should
be made from the stratosphere, utilizing balloons for carrying the
recorders aloft. We find that the Smithsonian Institution already
166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

has plans for carrying out such a program of observations daily as
soon as funds may become available for the purpose.

With 95 percent of the earth’s atmosphere below the apparatus,
better measurements of the ultraviolet light could be made than at
any station on the earth’s surface. Notable advances in the design
of apparatus for measuring the ultraviolet part of the solar spectrum
have recently been made by Dr. O’Brien of the University of Rochester.
Such apparatus yields photographic records by means of which a
quantitative estimate of the ozone content of the upper air can be
made daily with a high order of accuracy. The part which this ozone
plays in modifying the amount and character of sunshine at the
earth’s surface is of very great importance. For weather and biologi-
cal behavior are undoubtedly sooner or later dependent upon both
the quantity of ozone and the quality of solar radiation received near
the surface of the earth.

The idea that weather may be associated with changes in the sun-
spot cycle is not new. Many investigators have attempted to find
relationships between sunspots and weather changes with the ultimate
hope that since we can predict with reasonable accuracy the main
trends in the solar cycle we may ultimately be able to predict likewise
the main trends in changes of weather. The relationship between
weather and sunspots is not a simple one. While some may doubt
that any direct relationship holds at all, we might say frankly that
there is certainly no adequate proof to the contrary.

In spite of many conflicting results, it appears that in general the
temperature of the world at large is somewhat higher at sunspot
minima than at sunspot maxima. This seems at first paradoxical
since we might well expect that at sunspot maxima the sun would
send us more heat and radiation than at sunspot minima. Many of
Dr. Abbot’s observations, especially during the earlier years, seem to
corroborate this. Yet the surface temperature of the globe could be
actually cooler in years when the earth is receiving more heat from
the sun, for increased heat produces increased evaporation which in
turn generally results in increased rainfall. Increased rainfall actually
lowers the temperature of the earth’s surface and again by evapora-
tion, continues to cool the air immediately above. Furthermore, with
the warming of the earth, a vast convectional system of atmospheric
currents results. As air warmed near the surface of the earth rises,
cold air flows in from the polar regions with its chilling effects. It
appears entirely possible that even with an increase in the heat received
by the earth from the sun, so far as surface conditions are concerned,
actually lower temperatures would occur at selected regions.

One thing is certain, and that is that all the weather on the earth
is produced ultimately by the sun. So far as changes in the sun’s
radiation affecting the general circulation of the atmosphere are con-
THE SUN AND THE ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 167

cerned, it is to be expected that such changes would ultimately give
rise to the formation of storms and the storm tracks resulting. One
of the difficulties in establishing any intimate connection between
weather and sunspots is that our observations of weather tend to be
very local.

If one averages weather conditions over the entire globe, as, for
example, comparing the average rainfall record at observing stations
throughout the world, one might expect at first thought to find some
relation with sunspots, assuming that sunspots have anything to do
with weather phenomena. Such, however, is far from the case.
A storm in one region of the globe means clear weather elsewhere, for
a region of low pressure presupposes a region of high pressure adjacent.
Similarly, excessive rainfall in a given locality in a given year will
usually be offset by one of extreme dryness occurring elsewhere. To

average together such effects will obviously lead to no definite conclu-
sion. Furthermore, since storms travel over more or less defined
tracks, the migration of these storm centers makes it impossible to get
significant results from hundreds of stations scattered from the polar
regions to the Equator. If progress is to be made, it will come
through a consciousness of the distribution of weather as a whole over
the entire globe. For a more accurate picture of world weather,
indications for weather in a given locality at a given time may be
more easily estimated.

Mr. H. H. Clayton, of Canton, Mass., a well-known scientist who
has spent many long years in weather bureau service, is a firm believer
that changes in the sun are accompanied by fundamental changes in
the earth’s atmosphere. He appears to have found very definite
indications that changes in the earth’s atmosphere in different parts
of the world accompany the changes in solar activity attendant upon
the solar cycle, in which we can be sure Dr. Abbot would concur.
168 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

Looking at the weather on a world-wide scale, Clayton has found
that pressures oscillate from one region to another in some way which
appears to depend upon the intensity of solar activity. He finds
there is an opposite trend over the continents and oceans in summer as
compared with winter, and that the trend is different in the equatorial
regions from that in the extratropical belts. In the equatorial regions
temperatures are distinctly lower at sunspot maximum and higher at
sunspot minimum. The same is true in the North and South Tem-
perate Zones, but in the arid regions bordering the Tropics the
temperature actually averages little higher around sunspot maximum
than at sunspot minimum. From his studies he concludes that while
the North Atlantic shows 10 to 20 percent more precipitation, the
eastern half of the United States is in the region where rainfall is
actually less during maximum activity on the sun. He concludes that
our weather is the result of certain progressive wavelike movements
of certain disturbed areas, originating in different parts of the world.
With each cycle of change in solar activity, the centers of high baro-
metric pressure move from high latitudes to low latitudes and back
again. The amplitude of their oscillations and the speed with which
these waves progress appears to be inversely proportional to the length
of the period of oscillation.

In years of unusually high sunspot maxima as is the case at the
present time, areas of high pressure appear to be pushed farther north-
ward. The return of these highs to low latitudes with accompanying
colder and clearer weather may, he believes, be so retarded under
such instances as to invert the phase of a cycle which has persisted
for some time, when the amplitudes of these oscillations have been of
less magnitude. Thus there will be several years when the differences
in barometric pressure between the equatorial region and North
Temperate Zone become greater than normal, and then this period
will be followed by several years when the pressure differences become
less than normal. The shifting of these centers of action, he believes,
is definitely associated with sunspots.

Mr. Clayton’s conclusions are based on so large an amount of data
and upon such a wide experience in meteorology that no one interested
in weather or weather prediction can overlook the significance of these
contributions. One might venture to suggest that one of the most
important discoveries in the matter of weather prediction may come
as a byproduct of some of these investigations.

Various attempts have been made to attribute climatic cycles to
changes in solar activity. Perhaps the most outstanding scientific
contribution in this direction has come from Prof. A. E. Douglass, of
the University of Arizona, who has spent a lifetime measuring varia-
tions in the tree growth, especially in the forests of the Southwest and
in California, Douglass noted that sequences in periods of rapid
THE SUN AND THE ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 169
growth of trees, as measured by the widths of their rings, follow
very closely the sequences in the sunspot cycle. Since variations in
tree growth suggest variations in precipitation, he has accumulated a
vast amount of evidence for alternations of wet and dry periods vari-
able with the sunspot cycle, carrying records backward for some
3,000 years. His studies appear to indicate that at least for selected
regions, trees have shown most growth when sunspots were most
numerous. It does not appear improbable, however, that the growth
of trees integrates all favorable conditions and that temperature, the
quality of sunlight, and particularly the percentage of ultraviolet
enter into the growth rate of trees as well as does rainfall.

Sunspot periods have also been traced with minor discrepancies in
the flow of rivers and the level of lakes, some regions responding
much more clearly than others to the sunspot cycle.

Altogether we see there are many indications that the earth responds
to the changing state of the sun over an interval of a little over 11
years and often by double this period or approximately 23 years.
Whether all of the effects produced in the earth and its atmosphere
that are noticed at sunspot maxima are the result of the sunspots
themselves or whether the state of the sun and its whole surroundings
are so activated as to change materially the cosmic environment of
the earth is a question still unanswered. Enough has been said to
indicate that it is eminently desirable to be able to predict sunspots
with all the accuracy that our somewhat scanty knowledge will permit.

Many attempts have been made to analyze the curve of sunspot
activity from the time of reliable records, which began in the middle
of the eighteenth century, up to the present time. Investigators
differ as to the number of significant periods which may enter into
the solar graph. In addition to the 11- and 23-year cycles, others of
37, 68, 77, 83, 252, 300, and even possibly as long as 1,400 years have
been assigned. Authorities are not in agreement as to the reality of
some of these intervals. Obviously we have hardly enough sunspot
records to be sure of any intervals of 100 years or more.

Somewhat over 2 years ago, on the basis of the occurrences of the
past cycles and the present rate in the rise in sunspots, I ventured to
predict that the next sunspot maximum would occur in the early part
of 1938, or more than a year before what would have been expected
by adding 11 years to the time of the last maximum. If subsequent
observations should prove my predictions correct, it would be one of
the pleasantest and most unexpected turns of fate for which a scientist
could hope. We have not yet an adequate basis for any degree of
precision in the sunspot prediction.

The sunspot records obtained during the last year already have out-
topped the records of 1917 and indeed all previous maxima subsequent
to that of 1870. It will be observed from the sunspot curve that in
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1938

general alternate peaks are much more sharp in their formation than
the intervening ones. The long drawn-out maximum of 1927-29
should, therefore, be followed by a relatively sharp peak. With the
rapid rise upward during the last year and the high maximum of last
July, my own view is that the present maximum cannot carry beyond
1938 without a substantial trend downward in the average sunspot
numbers.

Mr. Clayton’s analysis of the sunspot cycle from 1750-1910 has
led him to attempt a prediction from 1910 to 1955, using only the
data accumulated previous to his predicted curve. The rather
remarkable correspondence between his predicted curve and the
observed curve from 1910 to date suggests that his independent fore-
cast for a maximum at the end of 1937 or the beginning of 1938 lends
an increased interest to the critical part of the curve in which we
find ourselves at present.

There is another important variation in the characteristic of sun-
spots of which we must not lose sight. This is the apparent drift in
the positions of the spots toward the solar equator as the cycle
progresses. At the beginning of the sunspot cycle the spots first
appear in the neighborhood of 35° either side of the sun’s equator.
This was exemplified in the case of the present sunspot cycle which
started in 1934 with high latitude spots. As the solar cycle advances,
the spots increase in number and tend to break out at progressively
lower latitudes on the sun. While there is some fluctuation back and
forth in latitude from day to day and month to month, the trend is
always toward the equator. As the sunspot period approaches the
maximum, the average latitude for the maximum number of spots is in
the vicinity of 15° both for the northern and the southern hemispheres.
After the maximum the spots decrease in size and number but they
continue to break out at decreasing latitudes. The end of the cycle
is marked by infrequent spots occurring when they are seen on either
side of the sun’s equator in latitudes ranging from 2° to 5°. By the
time this state is reached the next cycle has begun again with spots
breaking out once more in high latitudes.

This peculiar trend of latitude during the sunspot period is so far
without any adequate explanation. Observation of latitudes, how-
ever, helps very much in diagnosing where we may be with respect
to the sunspot cycle at the present time. The average latitude of the
spots of both hemispheres during the last 3 months has been 15.5°
and leads us to believe, therefore, that we are now very close to the
present sunspot maximum. By the end of 1938 it would appear that
we will find solar activity definitely on the down grade, in which case
the next sunspot minimum should arrive not far from 1944.

If we knew what was the cause of sunspots, it would help very much
in solving the mystery of the solar cycle and in predicting the future
