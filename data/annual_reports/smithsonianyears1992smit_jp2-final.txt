Donors to the Smithsonian Institution in

Fiscal Year 1992

The Board of Regents and the Secretary of the Smithsonian join with the en-
tire staff in thanking all of the Institution’s friends for the generosity they
have shown with their financial support, gifts to the collection, and in-kind

donations. Gifts are recorded under the title of the recipient bureau or

office, with a brief description of the gift where appropriate. If perchance

the name of any donor has been omitted from these lists, it is an inadver-

tence and in no way diminishes the Institution’s gratitude. Many gifts were

received from donors who prefer to remain anonymous; the Smithsonian
wishes to thank these people, as well, for their support.
