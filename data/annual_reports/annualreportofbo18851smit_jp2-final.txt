JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 21, 1885.

The annual meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution was held this day at half past 10 o’clock A. M.

Present: Hon. G. F. EpMuNDs, Hon. J. S. MoRRILL, Hon. S. B.
MAxky, Hon. O. R. SINGLETON, Hon. W. L. WILSON, Hon. W. W.
PHELPS, Rev. Dr. JOHN MACLEAN, Rev. Dr. NoAH PORTER, Dr.
HENRY CopPppsEs, Dr. JAMES C. WELLING, and the Secretary, Professor
BAIRD.

Excuses for non-attendance were read from Chief-Justice Waite,
Prof. Asa Gray, and Hon. N. P. Hill.

In the absence of the Chancellor, on motion of Mr. Phelps, Dr. Por-
TER was called to the chair.

The journal of the Board was read and approved.

The Secretary stated that the Rev. Dr. NOAH PORTER had been
re-elected a Regent for six years by the joint resolution of Congress,
approved March 3, 1884.

The Secretary presented to the Board the following letter:

Prof. SPENCER F.. BAIRD,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution :

DEAR Sir: The state of my health renders it necessary to tender my
resignation as a member of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution.

In signifying my resignation it is with no ordinary feelings I recall
the years I have been connected with the Board and the distinguished
men with whom it has been my privilege and honor to be associated.
Not only the present members whom I so highly respect and esteem,
but a long list of honored names of former members now deceased, re-
cur to me, the last of which is that of Professor JoSEPH HENRY, and
while JAMES SMITHSON will be known to the world and remembered
as the founder of the Institution, JosEpH HENRy will be regarded as
having been raised up by a signal Providence, the true interpreter of
his will, the able organizer of the Institution, and wise controller of its
finances.

xI
XII JOURNAL OF THE BOARD.

May the Smithsonian Institution, so auspiciously established and ex-
tensively known, continue, under your wise administration, an estab-
lishment distinct and specific, for the “‘increase and diffusion of knowl-

edge among men.”
With great respect, your friend and servant,

PETER PARKER.

2 LAFAYETTE SQUARE,
Washington, D. C., April 7, 1884.

The Secretary informed the Board that Congress had filled the va.
caney occasioned by the resignation of Dr. Parker by the election of
Dr. JAMES C. WELLING, president of Columbian University of Wash-
ington, D. C., for six years from May 13, 1884.

On motion of Dr. Maclean it was—

Resolved, That the Board of Regents has heard with regret of the
resignation of Dr. Peter Parker, and hereby expresses the high appre-
ciation of the valuable and efficient services he has rendered the Insti-
tution for the past seventeen years as a Regent and as Chairman of its
Executive Committee.

The Secretary stated that in accordance with the rules of the Board
during its recess, the remaining members of the Executive Committee
had filled the vacancy occasioned by the resignation of Dr. Parker, by
the appointment of Dr. Welling.

On motion of Dr. Coppée it was—

Resolved, That Dr. Welling be elected to fill the vacancy in the Ex-
ecutive Committee.

The Secretary reported that in accordance with the request of the
Board at its last meeting, Senator Edmunds had prepared a bill rela- |
tive to the provision for an Acting Secretary, which had passed Con-
gress and become a law on the 13th of May, 1884, as follows:

An act to provide for the appointment of an Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
[Public No. 31, Forty-eighth Congress, first session. ]

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the Chancellor of the
Smithsonian Institution may, by au instrument in writing filed in the
office of the Secretary thereof, designate and appoint a suitable person
to act as Secretary of the Institution when there shall be a vacaney in
said office, and whenever the Secretary shall be unable from illness,
absence, or other cause to perform the duties of his office; and in such
case the person so appointed may perform all the duties imposed on the
Secretary by law until the vacancy shall be filled or such inability shall
cease. The said Chancellor may change such designation and appoint-
ment from time to time as the Institution may in his judgment require.

Approved, May 13, 1884.

JOURNAL OF THE BOARD. XIII

Under the provisions of this act the Chancellor had taken the fol-
lowing action:
LyME, Conn., July 2, 1884.
By virtue of the authority conferred on me by the act of May 13,
1884, “to provide for the appointment of an Acting Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution,” I hereby designate and appoint Mr. WILLIAM
J. RHEES to act as Secretary of the Institution when there shall be a
vacancy in that office, and whenever the Secretary shall be unable from
illness, absence, or other cause to perform the duties of his office.
M. R. WAITE,
Chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution.

Dr. Maclean presented the annual report of the Executive Commit-
tee, which was read.

-On motion of Dr. Coppée it was—

Resolved, That the report of the Executive Committee be accepted,
and that the income for the year 1885 be appropriated for the service
of the Institution upon the basis of the above report, to be expended
by the Secretary with full discretion as to the items, subject to the
approval of the Executive Committee.

The Secretary presented the following communication he had received
since the last meeting of the Board:

JUNE 2, 1884.
SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Secretary Smithsonian Institution,
Washington, D. C.:

Sir: I intend to make a bequest for the advancement of science—
that is, of physical science. For many reasons I would like to make
the bequest in favor of the Smithsonian Institution; but there is one
difficulty which must be cleared up before I can decide. If money were
left by will to the Smithsonian Institution would it defend the will
against the claims of any and all persons who should contest the will
and take legal steps to set it aside? Has it authority by law; has it
funds that it would be authorized to use for the purpose of defending a
will in its favor? As I have no children the will would be less likely
to be contested, but there are others who might attempt to set it aside.
For this reason what I wish above all to be assured of, is that any legacy
that I leave for the purpose named will not be given up without making
a fight of it if needful. Please explain this point.

I wish you to send me a form of words, the very words themselves,
in which a bequest should be made so that there could be no pretense
of setting it aside for vagueness; and that will carry out my intentions,
which I will explain:

The chief part I would desire to bequeath to the Institution would be
for the “increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,” and beside
would wish to have the Institution invest say $300 (is that too insig-
nificant for the purpose?) and use the income thereof for conferring a
gold medal either annually or biennially (which would be the better?)
on the person who had made the most important discovery in physical
Science during the year, or two years, ending, say a year before the
date of ccuferring the medal. lor example, the Regents would have
to decide, say in the month of December, 1883, who made the most
important discovery in physical science during the year, or two years,
ending December 51, 1882. If you have my meaning put it in language
that will make it perfectly clear without multiplying words.
XIV JOURNAL OF THE BOARD.

The medal not for any patented invention, like the electric light, for _
example, but especially and only for such discoveries as Pasteur on in-
fection, fermentation, &c., and G. Darwin’s on tidal action. Regents
to be sole judges as to what is meant by physical science and most im-
portant discoveries therein.

The reason why I would like to have not only suggestions and ex-
planations but the full “TI will and bequest to” is also because I don’t
know whether to say the Regents shall do this or that, or whether to
say a majority or quorum of them shall do it in order to make it both
strictly legal and also practicable; also, whether or not it is necessary
to say how the Regents shall invest the money. J suppose a copy of
that part of Hamilton’s or Huebus’ (Habel?) will would answer for the
part relating to the ‘increase and diffusion,” &c. As for the medal I
believe no fund has been left to institutions for that purpose, and I
should like to have your opinion on it. }

Please return this letter with your answer, which I would like you to
let me have as soon as you can; taking, however, all the time you need
to make it so full and explicit that no further correspondence will be
necessary at this stage. I mean business if your answer is satisfactory.
For the present I desire this affair to be treated as confidential, or if
necessary to mention to other parties, withhold the name.

There is one thing I had rather do than make a bequest in favor of
the Institution, namely, pay over a certain sum, say $2,000 or $2,500,
in trust to the Regents; provided I could receive the income during
life, the Institution to have the sole use and possession of the same
after ny death. Would the Institution be authorized to accept a sum
of money on such terms? :

Respectfully,
* * * *

After full discussion of the subject it was, on motion of Mr. EKdmunds—

Resolved, That the communication be referred to the Executive Com-
mittee with full power to act in relation to it.

The Secretary, Professor Baird, presented his annual report of the
operations of the Institution for the year 1884, which was read in part.

On motion of Dr. Maclean, the Secretary was instructed to transmit
the report to Congress.

On motion of Mr. Edmunds, it was—

Resolved (1), That the fiscal year of the Institution shall hereafter ter-
minate on the 30th day of June in each year.

(2) That the Secretary shall heveafter prepare and cause to be printed
and sent to each member of the Board on or before the first day of De-
cember in each year, his annual report.

(3) That the annual meeting of the Board of Regents shall hereafter

REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF
REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION. ;

The Executive Committee of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution respectfully submits the following report in relation to the
funds of the Institution, the appropriations by Congress for the Na-
tional Museum and other purposes, and the receipts and expenditures
for the Institution and the Museum since December 31, 1884.

At the last meeting of the Board of Regents (January 21, 1885) it
was ordered that “ the fiscal year of the Institution shall hereafter ter-
minate on the 30th day of June ia each year.”

In accordance with this action it becomes the duty of the Executive
Committee to confine its present report to the financial operations and
condition of the Institution, for the six months ending June 30, 1885:

Condition of the fund July 1, 1885.

The amount of the bequest of James Smithson deposited in the
Treasury of the United States, according to the act of Congress of
August 10, 1846, was $515,169. To this was added, by authority of
Congress, act of February 5, 1867, the residuary legacy of Smithson and
savings from annual income and other sources, $134,831. To this $1,000
was added by a bequest of James Hamilton, $500 by a bequest of Simeon
Habel, and $51,500 as the proceeds of the sale of Virginia bonds owned
by the Institution, making, in all, as the permanent Smithson fund in
the United States Treasury, $703,000.

XVIII REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

The committee has examined the vouchers for payments made from
the Smithson income during the six months ending 30th June, 1885, all
of which bear the approval of the Secretary of the Institution, and a
certificate that the materials and services charged were applied to the
purposes of the Institution.

The committee has also examined the accounts of the National Mu-
seum and find that the balances above given correspond with the cer-
tificates of the disbursing officers of the Interior and Treasury Depart-
ments. zs

The quarterly accounts-current, the vouchers, and journals have been
examined and found correct.

REFORT OF PROFESSOR BAIRD,

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, FOR 1885.

To the Board of Regents:

GENTLEMEN: In accordance with the resolution of the Board at the
last meeting directing that the fiscal year, instead of extending from
January to December, shall correspond with the Government fiscal year,
and extend from July to the following June, inclusive, the present re-
port will inelude the history of the operations of the Institution for the
first half of 1885 only. The same restrictions in regard to time will
apply to the reports of the National Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology,
and the system of International Exchanges which have been placed by
Congress under the direction of the Institution. As heretofore, there
will also be some account of the operations of the United States Fish
Commission, and those of the Geological Survey, which, although not
controlled in any way by the Institution, are so closely affiliated with it
as to render proper some notice of them.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

INTRODUCTORY.

The general routine work of the Institution continues to be much the
Same as in previous years, and while no specially new features have
been introduced, considerable extension has been made in some depart-
ments, and increased precision and efficiency in all. In the way of
extra duty the principal occasion has been the International Exposition
at New Orleans, where the Institution (by requirement of law) made a
very extensive display.

The new work on the eastern portion of the Smithsonian building has
been entirely finished, and much progress made in renovating the cen-
tral portion.

A considerable number of valuable publications have appeared, and
others are in press.

The work of the Museum continues to increase in magnitude, much
material having been received from the New Orleans Exposition.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

It is with great regret that 1 announce the termination of service on

the Board, of General William T. Sherman, his term having expired and
H. Mis. 15 1

2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

his removal from Washington to Saint Louis, Mo., rendering him ineli-
gible for re-election, the law of organization requiring two members
of the Board to be citizens of the District of Columbia. Dr. Welling,
president of Columbian University, is the only member from this city at
present, he having been elected by Congress at its last session a Regent
for six years, until May 13, 1890.

The term of service of an unusually large number of Regents will
expire during the winter of 1885-1886. As “members at large,” Rev.
Dr. John Maclean, of New Jersey, Prof. Asa Gray, of Massachusetts,
and Dr. Henry Coppée, of Pennsylvania, will cease to be members on
the 19th of December next; and as the Forty-ninth Congress will com-
mence its session in the same month, it will become the duty of the
Speaker to appoint three Regents from the House of Representatives.

The term of Hon.N. P. Hill, of Colorado, as Senatorial Regent, expired
on the 3d of March, 1885, and on March 25, 1885, the Vice-President,
Mr. Hendricks, appointed Hon. Shelby M. Cullom, of Illinois, as Regent
during his term of service as United States Senator. The Vice-Presi-
dent on the same date also re-appointed Hon. J. S. Morrill, of Vermont,
for a new term of six years.

Until the next meeting of the Board of Regents, in J anuary, 1886, the
- vacaney existing in the Executive Committee by the expiration of the
term of General Sherman was filled by the appointment of Dr. Henry
Coppée ad interim, by the remaining members of the committee.

The Board at its last meeting adopted an important resolution, order-
ing that the fiscal year of the Institution shall terminate on the 30th of
June of each year. This changes the practice of the Institution since
its organization, and will occasion some difficulty in arranging tables
of comparison of receipts and expenditures for annual periods. The
reason for the change is that the fiscal year of the Government termi-
nates in June, and as the appropriations made by Congress for the
Museum, the exchange system, ethnological researches, &c., are for this
period, it was thought advisable for the accounts of the Institution to
conform to those of the General Government. The accounts of the In-
stitution have therefore been given in this report only for the six
months terminating on the 30th of June, 1885.

Change in the time of printing the Report.—It was also ordered by the
Board that “the Secretary shall hereafter prepare and cause to be
printed and sent to each member of the Board, on or before the 1st day
of December in each year, his annual report.”

Difficulty has always been experienced in the early printing of the
Annual Report of the Institution. The organic act, August 10, 1846,
provides that “the Board” of Regents “shall submit to Congress, at
each session thereof, a report of the operations, expenditures, and con-
dition of the Institution.* In accordance with this law the Board has
annually submitted to Congress a report of the operations of the Insti-
tution, which has been ordered to be printed and a number of extra

* Revised Statutes, Title LX XIII, Section 5593.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 3

copies granted for its use and distribution. The Public Printer how-
ever has not felt authorized to put any part of the report in type before
the adoption by Congress of a special resolution to print the extra
copies referred to, and as there has frequently been great delay in the
passage of the concurrent resolution, many months have frequently
elapsed between the annual meeting of the Board and the printing of
the report.

The best illustration of this delay is furnished by reference to the
report of the Institution for the year 1883, which, although submitted
to Congress on the 21st of January, 1884, was actually not ordered to
be printed till July, 1884, and not delivered to the members and to the
Institution until August, 1885.

To remedy this evil and to secure prompt publication, the Regents
adopted the resolution referred to above at its last meeting, and by the
efforts of the members of the Board in the Senate and House of Rep-
resentatives secured the passage of the following joint resolution by
Congress, No. 18, approved by the President of the United States
March 3, 1885:

“Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the annual reports of
the Smithsonian Institution shall be hereafter printed at the Govern-
ment Printing Office, in the same manner as the annual reports of the
heads of Departments are now printed, for submission in print to the
two Houses of Congress.”

The intent of this act is to instruct the Public Printer to print the
Annual Report of the Regents whenever copy shall be furnished, so
that the whole report may be presented to Congress in printed form at
the commencement of each session.

The statute under which the reports of Departments are printed is
as follows:

“The head of each Department, except the Department of Justice,
shall rurnish to the Congressional Printer copies of the documents
usually accompanying his annual report, on or before the first day of
November in each year, and a copy of his annual report on or before
the third Monday of November in each year.*

“Tt is further provided that of the documents accompanying the an-
nual reports of the Executive Departments one thousand copies shall
be printed and bound for the use of the members of the Senate, and
two thousand copies for the use of themembers of the House of Repre-
sentatives, in addition to the usual number for Congress, 1,900 copies.”t

While the printing of the report is now secured without a special
order at each session of Congress, it will still be necessary to havea
concurrent resolution every year for the printing of extra copies for the
use of the Institution.

FINANCES.

The financial condition of the Institution continues to be satisfactory.

The Smithson fund remains the same as at the date of the last report,

* Revised Statutes, Title IV, section 196.
t Revised Statutes, Title XLV, section 3798.

4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

$703,000, deposited forever in the United States Treasury, from which is
received an annual interest of 6 per cent. This interest is paid on the
1st of January and 1st of July, and the money immediately placed in
the hands of the Treasurer of the United States, who keeps a special
account of it. All payments are made by checks on this officer, signed
by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. A monthly statement
is rendered by the Treasurer of all checks paid and of the balances. This
is compared with the books kept by the accountant of the Institution.
A quarterly examination is made by the Executive Committee of the
Regents of all the financial transactions of the Institution. The mem-
bers of the committee sign a certificate, of which the annexed is a copy:

States Geological Survey; those for the preservation of Government
collections, furniture, and fixtures, and other objects for the National
Museum, by Mr. George W. Evans, disbursing clerk of the Interior
Department.

The vouchers for all these expenditures are critically examined by
the proper Auditor and the Comptroller of the Treasury, and have been
formally passed by those officials.

Every payment for the Institution and its dependencies is made by
bonded officers of the Government.

BUILDINGS.

The Smithsonian Building.—As stated in previous reports, two appro-
priations were made by Congress for fire-proofing the eastern portion of
the Smithsonian building and increasing its accommodations for doing
the Government work connected with the Museum, the International
Exchanges, &c. The whole has now been completed in a thoroughly
fire-proof manner, with twice the original number of available office
rooms, and with every facility for doing the work mentioned in the best
possible manner.

The rest of the Smithsonian building is in an unsightly and dilapi-
dated condition, and will before long require extensive repairs in the
way of a new ceiling to the second-story room, and the re-arrangement
of cases in the first floor, &e.; an undertaking which, as being strictly
in the interest of the National Museum, will warrant the asking Con-
gress for the necessary appropriation.

The exterior of the central portion of the building was in a very bad
condition, requiring repainting, reglazing, &c., and this work has been
undertaken and practically completed at a moderate expense, greatly
improving its appearance.

National Museum Building.—This building is apparently in excellent
condition, and has required comparatively little in the way of repairs.
An appropriation was made in 1884 for a concrete walk along the south-
ern and eastern sides of the building, and was expended so as to furnish
a much-needed improvement in the facilities of access.

Armory Building.—This building, which has been assigned by law for
the purposes of the Smithsonian Institution and the United States Fish
Commission, is occupied partly for the storage of collections and partly
for the active work of the Commission. It now constitutes what is
known as the central hatching station of the Commission, where the
work of propagation of food fishes is conducted on a very extensive
scale. It is also the depot from which shipments of fish are made from
Washington to all parts of the country, and for this purpose has a
branch track of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad, by means of which
the cars are brought alongside of the building and receive and deliver
their loads.
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The Brick Workshop.—This building continues to be used for the same
purposes as in previous years, a part of it being occupied as a stable,
while the greater portion is used for the preparation and mounting of
birds, modelling in plaster and papier-maché, in painting the casts of
specimens, &e. ;

Temporary Workshop.—Reference has been made to a large shed or
annex, built at the expense of the appropriation for the New Orleans
Exposition, and used in the preparation of exhibits for the same, and
also for storage of the articles received therefrom, and their special
preparation for exhibition. It was also intended to receive the collec-
tions as returned until they could be properly assigned to their places
or otherwise disposed of. An appropriation was however made by Con-
gress at its last session to meet the cost of restoring the collections sent
to New Orleans to their original condition, very serious damage having
occurred in consequence of the dampness and other agencies. This
has made it necessary to retain the building for the present. As soon
as arrangements can be made to receive what is now stored therein, it
will be taken down and the ground cleared of what is a serious incum-
brance.

Army Medical Museum Building.—For several years the authorities of
the Army Medical Museum have been endeavoring to secure an appro-
priation for the erection of a fire-proof building for the accommodation
of the library of the Museum and the offices of the Bureau, so as to ob-
viate any possible danger of loss by fire of important archives and ma-
terial. An appropriation of $200,000 was finally made by Congress;
and the Secretary of War, the Architect of the Capitol, and the Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution were authorized to select a site
in the vicinity of the National Museum for the accommodation of the
aforesaid building. The committee met and selected the southeast
corner of the Smithsonian reservation, extending along Seventh street
170 feet and South B street 260 feet. . As the expenditure was contin-
gent upon the adequacy of the appropriation to construct the building
in question, the plans were prepared and submitted for estimate to a
number of bidders, whose offers were as follows :

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. fd

It thus appearing that the appropriation was adequate to the demand,
a contract was entered into with Messrs. Bright, Humphrey & Co., and
the work ordered by the Secretary of War to be prosecuted with the
utmost possible diligence.

Necessity of new buildings for the National Museum.—An application
was made to Congress a year or two ago for an appropriation with
which to commence the construction of a second building for museum
purposes, and also to accommodate the offices of the United States Geo-
logical Survey, an establishment which in its close affiliation to the
work of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum would
be appropriately quartered in connection therewith. This application
however was not granted; but the need is now much greater than be-
fore, as there is enough material in the way of valuable specimens of
‘economical interest to fill a second building the size of the present one.
This unexhibited surplus is now stored in several buildings,-some in
Washington and some elsewhere, and consists of important illustra-
tions of the economical geology, metallurgy, and other resources of the
United States. In addition to what has been on hand for some time,
very large collections were presented to the Government at the New
Orleans Exhibition, which embraced a great deal of intrinsic value as
well as of popular and scientific interest. It is earnestly to be hoped
that this requirement will be met by Congress by the speedy appropri-
ation of an amount suitable for the purpose.

For the safety of the general collections of the National Museum a
separate building is also very much needed for the accommodation of
the alcoholic specimens, such as are now provided by most first-class
museums. Although the present building is practically fire-proof, yet
should a fire be started in the vicinity of these specimens it is probable
that much damage would be done by the ignition of the many thou-
sands of gallons of alcohol, and the destruction of the specimens and of
the jars in which they are contained.

EXPLORATIONS.

As the present report, in view of the change of the fiscal year of
the Smithsonian Institution, covers only the period from January 1 to
June 30, 1885, the account of explorations will necessarily be much
shorter than usual, especially as such work frequently does not begin
until midsummer. The completion of the history of 1885 must there-
fore be deferred until the next report. |

Greenland, Labrador, and the British Provinces.—Reference has been
made in a previous report to the return of the Greely expedition and to
the general results accomplished. Specimens illustrating the botany of
the region in the vicinity of Lady Franklin Bay have been sent to the
National Museum by Lieutenant Greely.
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Mr. Lucien M. Turner has been engaged in preparing his report upon
the natural history and meteorology of the region about Fort Chimo,
Ungava Bay, Northern Labrador, where he spent several years, as stated
in the last report. As he completes his investigations of the various
collections, they are turned over to the National Museum, and represent
very important additions to its treasures. The report will be made to
the U. 8. signal officer.

Important material, especially in geology and paleontology, has been
received from the Geological Survey of Canada.

Alaska.—There has been an unusual amount of activity in the inves.
tigation of the geography and natural history of Alaska, especially the

northern portion. Lieut. George M. Stoney, of the United States —

Navy, with a force of naval officers and men, has been engaged in con-

tinuing the explorations made by him in 1884, and already reported.

upon. The revenue cutter Corwin also again visited the Arctic Ocean,
and parties were sent up the Kowak and other rivers emptying into
Kotzebue Sound. Mr. Charles H. Townsend, an accomplished collector,
accompanied the vessel and made many interesting gatherings in nat-
ural history. Mr. Henry D. Woolfe, agent of the Pacific Steam Whal-
ing Company, stationed at Cape Lisburne, in the Arctic Ocean, has also
collected numerous specimens, including shells and marine invertebrates.
A few of these have been sent in, but the greater part of the collection
has yet to come.

Mr. Jobn J. McLean, signal observer at Sitka, has continued his
transmissions of rare and interesting archeological material, while Mr.
W. J. Fisher, at Kodiak, has forwarded additional series of ethnological
objects, birds, &c. Mr. Johnson, Signal Service observer at Nushagak,
has transmitted some desirable specimens of birds.

Washington Territory and the west coast of the United States.—Mr.
James G. Swan, of Port Townsend, has furnished a number of interest-
ing ethnological specimens, obtained from the Indians of Puget Sound,
and Ensign A. P. Niblack, U.S. N., attached to the United States Coast
Survey steamer Carlile P. Patterson, while proceeding in that vessel from
San Francisco around Cape Horn and thence to Alaska, gathered many
notes upon the natural bistory and ethnology of the country, and trans-
mitted them to the Smithsonian Institution, with quite a number of
specimens.

Hast coast of the United States and Gulf of Mexico.—During the first half
_ of the year 1885 the steamer Albatross, of the United States Fish Com-
mission, continued its important exploration into the fisheries and the
natural history and physical condition of the waters adjacent to the
coast of the United States. The winter and early spring were spent in
the Gulf of Mexico in search of new fishing grounds for valuable fish,
and in June was commenced a similar work on the banks of Newfound-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

land and the other fishing banks still nearer to the coast of New Eng-
land. The result of these explorations, when published, will be found
to be of much practical benefit and will add greatly to our information.

New Mexico and Arizona.—Mr. E. W. Nelson bas continued his work
in connection with the archeology and natural history of Arizona, and
has sent in a large number of boxes of valuable collections.

Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, at Fort Wingate, N. Mex., has also supplied
much interesting material.

Dr. F. W. Taylor has sent some rare minerals and fossils from the
vicinity of Lake Valley.

Mexico and Lower California.—Mr. L. H. Aymé, to whom reference
has been made in previous reports, has continued his explorations and
investigations into the natural history and ethnology of Western Mexico,
and has contributed much material to the National Museum.

Professor Dugés, of Guanajato, has also sent in a number of interest-
ing specimens for identification.

Dr. Edward Palmer was sent to make explorations into the ethnology .
of the regions in the vicinity of Chihuahua, and was enabled by the
courtesy of Mr. A. R. Shepherd to acquire many interesting articles in
the neighborhood of Batopilas.

The investigations of Mr. Charles H. Townsend in regard to the oc-
currence of the great seal, known as the sea-elephant, were crowned
with success, some eight or ten specimens having been obtained and
forwarded to the National Museum. Itis confidently asserted that these
represent the last of the race and that we may fairly consider the species
as extinct on our coast.

Central and South America.—Prof. Miles Rock, who was appointed by
the Government of Guatemala as astronomer in the boundary survey
between Guatemala and Mexico, kindly offered his services to make
photographs and collections of any interesting objects he might find,
and has already fulfilled his promise by the transmission of a large
amount of material, including photographs, specimens of birds, and ob-
jects of archeology.

Mr. J. C. Zeledon, of Costa Rica, has also continued the transmissions
begun by him many years ago, and has supplied the National Museum
with an almost complete collection of the vertebrate animals of that
country.

Dr. W. H. Jones, of the United States Navy, was very successful in
archeological research on the coast of Peru and Chili, and the specimens
received from him are among the most highly prized of the articles in
the National Museum. |

Mr. George Kiefer, of Lima, has also made contributions of the same
character.

Europe.—Mr. Thomas Wilson, late consul at Nice, France, has been
busy during the greater part of his official term as consul, first at Nantes
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and then at Nice, in France, in explorations into the remains of prehis-
toric man, and has presented a very large collection, the unpacking of
which only awaits his return to this country. It is believed that this
collection, filling a large, number of boxes, will prove to be one of the
richest and most complete of its kind ever sent to the United States.

The results of minor researches of more or less productiveness, will
be detailed in the accompanying report of the National Museum.

PUBLICATIONS.

In view of the fact that the Annual Report of the Institution is yearly
presented to a number of readers for: the first time, it seems proper to
repeat frequently the general statement that the publications prepared
by it embrace three different classes. These are:

First, a quarto series of volumes of irregular issue entitled ‘* Smith-
sonian Contributions to Knowledge,” which consist of original memoirs
furnishing additions to scientific information, corresponding somewhat
with the Transactions of learned societies, though generally form-
ing more elaborate treatises than such publications. Asa rale these
contributions to positive knowledge are based on experiments, obser-
vations, or material, carefully undertaken or gathered by the institu-
tion, or they are the results of investigations originated or encouraged
and assisted by its means.

The second class of publications is an octavo series of volumes en-
titled ‘Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,” which also include
the presentation of a large amount of new truths developed by origi-
nal research, but which contain in addition useful summaries, essays on
improvements in classification—in zoology, botany, and other depart-
ments of science, and new and extended tables of physical, chemical,
and other natural constants; all of which possess great value in aiding
the labors of scientific specialists in many directions, and at the same
time are calculated to encourage inquiring minds to prosecute particu-
lar lines of investigation, as well as to afford facilities to such students.

The third class of publications is an octavo series of ‘“‘ Smithsonian
Reports,” presented annually to Congress, which include, in addition to
the usual record and statement of operations for the year, a consider-
able amount of carefully prepared matter on various scientific topics
intended for the general reader. ;

Distribution.—These publications are liberally distributed for the dif-
fusion of knowledge, but from the absolute impossibility of producing
editions large enough to supply all intelligent inquirers who might be
interested in their perusal, the distribution is now confined: 1st, to those
learned societies of the first class which give to the Institution in return
complete sets of their own publications; 2d, to colleges of the first
class furnishing catalogues of their libraries and students, and pub-
lications relative to their organization and history ; 3d, to public libra-

ries in this country having 25,000 volumes; 4th, they are presented in
some cases to still smaller libraries, especially if no other copies of the
Smithsonian publications are given in the same place, and a large dis-
trict would be otherwise unsupplied. To iystitutions devoted exclu-
sively to the promotion of particular branches of knowledge, such of its
publications are given as relate to their special objects.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge—A work on “ Prehistoric
Fishing in Europe and North America,” by Dr. Charles Rau, men-
tioned in my last report (that for 1884) as being in type and nearly
ready for the press, was printed and published early in the year, and
has since been distributed in ‘accordance with the general practice
adopted.. This work forms a volume of 342 pages (including the index),
with 18 pages of introductory matter, in all 360 pages, and is illus-
trated with 406 figures. Part I, occupying nearly one-third of the
memoir, is devoted to the archeological relics of Europe, giving a con-
cise though comprehensive survey of whatever is supposed to relate to
fishing, under the three epochs of the paleolithic age, the neolithic
age, and the bronzé age. Part II is occupied with the archeological
fishing relics of North America, under the general headings of ‘ Fish-
ing Implements and Utensils,” “‘ Boats and Appurtenances,” “ Prehis-
toric Structures connected with Fishing,” ‘“‘Aboriginal Representations
of Fishes, Aquatic Mammals, &c.,” and, lastly, ‘Artificial Shell-Depos-
its.” This descriptive summary is supplemented by an interesting col-
lection of extracts compiled from various writings of the sixteenth, sev-
enteenth, eighteenth, and nineteenth centuries, in which reference is
made to aboriginal fishing in North America.

During the past year two volumes of the Contributions to Knowledge
have been made up from outstanding memoirs.

Volume XXIV comprises: Article 1, “Results of Meteorological Ob-
servations made at Providence, R. I., extending over a period of forty-
five years, from December, 1831, to December, 1876.” By Prof. Alexis
Caswell, of Brown University, Providence, R. I. Published in 1882
(an account of which was given in the Annual Report for that year).
Article m1, “Tables and Results of the Precipitation in Rain and Snow
in the United States, and at some stations in adjacent parts of North
America and in Central and South America. Collected by the Smith-
sonian Institution, and discussed under the direction of Joseph Herry
and Spencer F. Baird, Secretaries.” By Charles A. Schott. Second
edition published in 1881 (an account of which was given in the An-
nual Report for that year). The whole forms a volume of 311 pages,
illustrated with 8 diagrams in the text, and accompanied by 5 plates
and 5 large folding maps of the United States, showing the curves of
equal precipitation for each of the four seasons and also for the vear.

Volume XXV comprises: Article 1, ‘“‘ Prehistoric Fishing in Europe
and North America.” By Dr. Charles Rau (just previously described).
LE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Article 1, “Archeological Researches in Nicaragua.” By J. F. Brans-
ford, M. D. Published in 1881 (an account of which was given in the

port for that year). The whole forms a volume of 509 pages, illustrated
with 545 cuts or figures and accompanied by 7 engraved plates.

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.—The ten following numbers com-
prise pamphlet editions of papers published by the Institution, which
being extracted from the Annual Report for 1883, should properly have

ological and Physical.” By Dr. Arnold Guyot, of Princeton College.
Fourth edition, revised and enlarged. Edited by William Libbey, jr.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

A quarter of a century has passed since the publication of the third
edition of this valuable and elaborate work. The first. edition of the
Tables was published by the Institution in 1852, comprising 212 pages.
Five years later (in 1857) a second edition was published, with careful
revision by the author, and the various series of tables were so en-
larged as to extend the work to over 600 pages. The third edition was
published in 1859, with still further amendments.

To this volume Dr. Guyot, with untiring industry, has been making
constant additions; and the present issue, projected by him in 1879 (from
various delays occasioned by pressing professional occupations, as well
as by illness and death in his family), was about four years in passing
through the press. Just before completing the last few tables, the esti-
mable and distinguished author departed this life, February 8, 1884, in
the seventy-seventh year of his age. The completion of the work was
intrusted to his able assistant, Prof. William Libbey, jr., who has judi-
ciously executed his duties as the final editor of the work. The tables
are arranged in seven series. The first series (comprising 15 tables),
thermometrical comparisons and conversions; the second series (of 33
tables), hygrometrical computations; the third series (of 27 tables),
barometrical; the fourth series (of 27 tables), hypsometrical; the fifth
series, geographical tables, including 40 of measures of length (for
heights, &e.), 10 of itinerary measures, and 10 of square measures of
geographical surface; the sixth series (of 99 tables) for corrections of
variations of temperature, &c., at different parts of the earth; and the
seventh series comprising 9 miscellaneous tables. The whole forms an
octavo volume (including 25 introductory pages) of 763 pages.

The Scientific Writings of Joseph Henry.—Good progress has been
made in the collation and printing of the collected scientific writings of
Professor Henry ; 600 octavo pages, or more than half the entire work,
having now (July 1) been set up in type, corrected, and stereotyped. It —
is estimated that the entire work will comprise 1050 pages; and it is
hoped that the whole will be stereotyped and printed off by the close
of the present year.

Bulletins of the National Museum.—These form a series (as heretofore
explained) designed to supply a prompt publication of original descrip-
tions of specimens received by the National Museum, and of other al-
lied matter. While these are primarily printed under the direction of
the honorable Secretary of the Interior, a supplementary edition is pub-
lished from the stereotype plates by the Institution for the benefit of
its correspondents, and they are included in its ‘‘ Miscellaneous Collec-
tions.”

Bulletin No. 27 comprises “‘ Descriptive Catalogues of the Collections
sent from the United States to the International Fisheries Exhibition,
London, 1883; constituting a Report upon the American Section,” pre-
pared under the direction of G. Brown Goode, United States commis-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

sioner, and a staff of associates. It contains a preliminary catalogue
and synopsis of the collections exhibited by the United States Fish
Commission and by special exhibitors; a concordance of the official
classification for the use of the juries; collection of economic crusta-
ceans, worms, echinoderms, and sponges, by Richard Rathbun ; a cata-
logue of the aquatic and fish-eating birds, by Robert Ridgway; a cata-
logue of the economic mollusca and the apparatus and appliances used
in their capture and preparation for the market, by Lieut. Francis
Winslow, U. 8S. N.; the whale-fishery and its appliances, by James
Temple Brown; a catalogue of the collection of fishes, by Tarleton
H. Bean; a descriptive catalogue of the collection illustrating the
scientific investigation of the sea and fresh waters, by Richard Rath-
bun; a catalogue of the aquatic mammals, by Frederick W. True;
a catalogue of the collection illustrating the fishing vessels and boats
and their equipment, the economic condition of fishermen, anglers’
outfits, &c., by Capt. Joseph W. Collins; a catalogue of the apparatus
for the capture of fish, by R. Edward Earll; a catalogue of fishery
products and of the apparatus used in their preparation, by A. How-
ard Clark; and a catalogue of the fish-cultural exhibit, by R. Edward
Harll; the whole forming (with introductory matter and general index)
an octavo volume of 1333 pages.

Report on the Reptiles and Batrachians of North America.—The Smith-
sonian Institution may claim the credit of having done more than any
_ other organization or any individual in furnishing to the students and
naturalists of the country convenient and effective text-books for the
determination of the natural history of the United States and North
America. In proof of this itis sufficient to point to what has been done
in the way of systematic treatises on mammals, birds, fishes, certain
groups of mollusks, &c.

Although a number of monographs of reptiles have been published
more or less directly under its auspices, such as that of the serpents
and other groups, there is still lacking a compact manual of both the
reptilia and batrachia; and arrangements were accordingly made with
Professor Cope, of Philadelphia, to supply this want. This gentleman is
well known for his professional acquaintance with these groups as studied
by him in the collections in the Museum of the Academy of Natural Sci-
ences of Philadelphia, the National Museum of Washington, and else-
where. An agreement was therefore made with him for the preparation
of a much-needed manual on the reptiles and batrachians of North Amer-
ica; a year’s time being allowed, at a suitable compensation, for the final
and critical examination of the collections of the National Museum and
the preparation of the report. In this way the entire field of the ver-
tebrates of North America will have been completely covered.

Proceedings of the National Museum.—This series, somewhat allied to
the series of “ Bulletins,” comprises papers relative to the collections—
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

generally of a less elaborate character, and aiming at a still greater
promptness of issue by having printed single “ signatures” of the peri-
odical so soon as the matter is furnished.

Volume VII of the “ Proceedings of the National Museum” was
completed during the early part of the year, and contains descriptive
‘ papers by Tarleton H. Bean, Charles E. Bendire, F. W. Clarke, W. H.
Dall, Frederick P. Dewey, H. G. Dresel, C. H. Fernald, Charles H.
Gilbert, Theodore Gill, G. Brown Goode, Asa Gray, Romyn Hitchcock,

Rothrock, John A. Ryder, R. W. Shufeldt, Elisha Slade, Sidney I. Smith,
Rosa Smith, Leonhard Stejneger, Joseph Swain, Cyrus Thomas, and
Frederick W. True; forming an octavo volume of 670 pages, illustrated
with 8 figures and 2 plates. .

The Smithsonian Annual Report.—The third class of publications con-
sists of Annual Reports of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution, presented to Congress, and printed by authority of that body.
The Report of 1883 was not issued till 1885. It contains the report of
the Secretary of the Institution for the year, supplemented by the cor-
respondence relative to the transfer of astronomical announcements by
telegraph to Harvard College Observatory; the report on the operations
of the Smithsonian system of international and domestic exchanges ;
and the report of the Assistant Director of the National Museum on
the condition of that department, together with a general Appendix,
embracing a record of scientific progress for the year,—in astronomy, by
Edward S. Holden; geology, by T. Sterry Hunt; geography, by F. M.
Green; meteorology, by Cleveland Abbe; physics, by George F. Barker ;
chemistry, by H. Carrington Bolton; mineralogy, by Edward 8. Dana;

Nutting, and J. Owen Dorsey. The Report forms an octavo volume of
997 pages (including introductory matter and index), illustrated with
33 figures and sketch-maps and 1 plate.

The “Annual Report of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian In-
stitution, for the year 1884,” forming an 8vo. volume of 943 pages (in-
cluding introductory matter and index), has been most unfortunately
delayed, and is not yet published.

Publications of the Bureau of Ethnology.—To the three preceding classes
of established publications (one of quarto size, and two of ordinary oe-
tavo size), a fourth class, of imperial octavo size, embracing the publi-
cations of the Bureau of Ethnology, under the direction of the Smith-
sonian Institution, may now properly be added. Of this series two vol-
umes have already appeared.

The “First Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, to the Smith-
sonian Institution,” by J. W. Powell, Director, though published two
years ago, was not noticed in the last report of the Secretary. This
work contains papers by J. W. Powell (in addition to his report proper),

by H. C. Yarrow, E. 8. Holden, C.C. Royce, Garrick Mallery, J.C. Pil-
ling, J. O. Dorsey, A. S. Gatschet, and S. R. Riggs. It forms an im-
perial octavo volume of 638 pages (including inno y matter and
index), and is illustrated with 292 figures in the text, 2 maps, and 53
plates, of which four are colored.

The “Second Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology, to the Smith-
sonian Institution,” by J. W. Powell, Director, contains papers by J. W.
Powell, Frank H. Cushing, Erminnie A. Smith, Henry W. Henshaw,
Washington Matthews, William H. Holmes, and James Stevenson. It
forms an imperial octavo volume of 514 pages (including introductory
matter and index), and is illustrated with 60 figures in the text, 2 maps,
and 173 plates, of which 12 are colored. The plates contain about 750
separate figures.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

One of the most important factors in the “diffusion of knowledge
among men” is found in the system of international exchange carried
on by the Smithsonian Institution. Originally only intended for the dis-
tribution of its own publications, the Institution by degrees extended
its usefulness and privileges to learned sovieties and individuals of both
hemispheres, and at present this exchange service forms the medium
of scientific intercourse between about 700 home institutions and 4,000
establishments distributed over all parts of the inhabited globe.

The gradual development of this service has resulted in a large in-
crease both in the work to be performed and in the number of employés.
The management of this branch has, since the year 1880, been in charge
of Mr. George H. Boehmer, and to his detailed report, hereto appended,
I refer for more minute information.

Statistics.—The increase in the number of parcels received will best be
illustrated by the following comparison of the first six months a 1885
with the full years of 1882, 1883, and 1884:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

The transmissions of exchanges have been in direct ratio to the
increase in the receipts, being for the first six months of 1885:

(1) Foreign exchanges: 345 boxes, representing a bulk of 2,415 cubic
feet, with a weight of 82,800 pounds, against 276 boxes during the same
period of 1884.

(2) Domestic exchanges: 5,138 packages, this being a little above the
half of the total number sent out during the year 1884.

(3) Government exchanges: 38 boxes, representing a bulk of 266 cubic
feet, with a weight of 10,500 pounds.

Congressional Aid.—The Smithsonian Institution continues to receive
the usual Congressional appropriation of $10,000 to carry out the op-
erations of the exchange service. The Library of Congress is the prin-
cipal beneficiary of the exchanges, large numbers of books and parcels
being annually received for that institution.

expenses of the exchange service consists in the granting of free freight
on the exchange parcels or boxes by the following transportation com-
panies and firms, for which liberality acknowledgments are hereby grate-
’ fully rendered:

The concessions of reduced freight on the part of the Pennsylvania
Railroad Company and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, as
well as by the line of freight steamers between Washington and New
York, have been continued.

The thanks of the Institution are also due to the foreign ministers and
consuls of the various Governments for their assistance in taking charge
of the transmission of boxes to the countries which they respectively
represent.

Government Huchanges.—By enactment of Congress of March 2, 1867,
the Institution was appointed the agent of the United States in an ex-
change of official public documents with foreign Governments. <As pro-
vided for by Congress, 50 copies of all official publications, whether ema-
nating from Congress or any Department or Bureau of the Government,
whether printed at the Congressional Printing Office or elsewhere, must
be delivered to the Library of Congress for distribution by the Smith-
sonian Institution and to such foreign Governments as are willing to
furnish to the Library of Congress a corresponding return from their
publications. The conditions of this exchange having been accepted
by 38 Governments—of which 19 are European—one box (the 23d of the
series since the establishment of this exchange) of United States pub-
lications was sent to each of these Governments in April, 1885.

The returns having for some years fallen considerably short of ex-
pectations, Mr. George H. Boehmer, in charge of the exchange office,
was detailed, at the request of the Librarian of Congress, and with the
sanction of the chairman of the Joint Committee on the Library, to
visit Europe for the purpose of arranging for better and fuller returns
on the part of those Governments exchanging with the United States.
For detailed information of the progress of his mission, success ob-
tained, and suggestions relative to the service, I would refer to the re-
port on the subject contained in the section “Government exchange
division” of his report on the operations of the exchan ge office, hereto
appended.

Mr. Boehmer left on his mission on the 24th of July, 1884, and re-
turned on the 20th of February, 1885, during which time he visited con-
secutively nearly all the European states, obtaining satisfactory re-
sults and securing large and valuable additions for the library, consist-
ing mostly of parliamentary papers and compilations of the laws of the
various Governments.

One of the principal obstacles preventing the establishment of per-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7M |

manently satisfactory measures on the part of the European Govern-
ments, and which can perhaps be obviated by a personal representation
in Europe, is caused by the entirely different understanding of the ex-
change question in those countries, resulting from the exchange conven-
tions of Paris in 1875 and 1880, and Brussels in 1883, and by the absence
of sufficient legislation by them for securing copies of official publica-
tions for exchange purposes.

The governmental bureaus of most of the European states issue their
pubiications through the medium of publishing houses, receiving from
these about 50 per cent. from the sales of the books. Copies for gra-
tuitous distribution, therefore, are not issued, but the books represent
a trade value which is accepted by the exchange Commissions (estab-
lished on the basis adopted at the Paris Convention of 1875), who are
allowed only to exchange value for value.

The publications of the United States, being issued at the public ex-
pense, and not considered as purchased (although they are quoted at
very high prices in the book trade, and especially abroad), it becomes
under these circumstances difficult to obtain in Europe satisfactory
returns. It is therefore suggested by Mr. Boehmer that in future
transactions the market value, as given by the foreign book trade, be
accepted, which would enable our Government to obtain more satisfac-
tory returns. ;

Preliminary arrangements have been effected with the Imperial Gov-
ernment of Austria for a complete exchange of all the official and sci-
entific publications of the two Governments.

The Government of Uruguay has also forwarded to the Smithsonian
Institution, through the United States Department of State, proposi-
tions relative to a full and permanent exchange of official public docu-

ments.

2D, REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
CO-OPERATIVE RELATIONS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

Duplicate Collection of Building Stones for the American Museum of Nat-
ural History, New York.—Among the various important subjects of in-
quiry on the part of the census organization of 1880, was one into the
statistics of the quarries in the United States used to furnish building
stones for building and ornamental purposes, and an arrangement was
made by General Walker with Dr. G. W. Hawes, curator of mineralogy
and lithology of the National Museum, to collect the necessary material,
and to prepare a complete report on the subject, this to be done at the
expense of the United States. General Walker also authorized an ar-
rangement by which, on payment of all the costs, Mr. Morris K. Jesup
was to have a duplicate collection, with a view to its presentation to the
American Museum of Natural History. Estimating the cost of acquisi-
tion of the specimens and their preparation, including a microscopical
section of each specimen, at $3.50 each, and the number of specimens
to be treated at one thousand, the sum of $3,500 was placed at the com-
mand of Dr. Hawes for the purpose in question. The work upon this
series was prosecuted with much vigor until interrupted by the death
of Dr. Hawes. During the present year however, the work was re-
newed, and the necessary means being furnished by Mr. Jesup, extra
workmen were employed upon his collection, which will probably be
ready for delivery in the course of the year 1885. By thus duplicat-
ing the collection without expense to the Smithsonian Institution or
the National Museum, the opportunity of study and comparison will be,
of course, greatly extended.

Bureau of Education.—In accordance with the general policy of the

Institution to do nothing with its funds which can equally well be done,

by other means, and to co-operate with other bureaus and departments
of the Government, the Institution turned over to the Commissioner of
Education 3,526 catalogues, announcements and reports of colleges and
educational institutions, together with 401 letters, and 1,978 card-slips,
containing an alphabetical list of the entire series.

The Diplomatic Review.—In March, 1883, the conductors of ‘The
Diplomatic Review” of England sent to the Smithsonian Institation an
offer of the Review to any library that would undertake to bind it.

By some strange mishap the letter containing this very liberal offer
went astray, and no attention was paid to it. In October, 1884, the
offer was renewed by Mr. C. D. Collet, the letter being accompanied by
a list of libraries to which the Review had been sent direct. ‘This letter
was the initiatory step of a correspondence, which will eventually result
in the distribution of several hundred sets of the Diplomatic Review, as
full as the conductors thereof can furnish.

The Diplomatic Review commenced in 1855, and carried on to the end
of 1865, under the title of the Free Press, is a continuation of the first

and second series of the Portfolio, in which, nearly half a century ago,
the late Mr. William Pollard Urquhart began h's series of articles on
the political history of Europe. In the pages of the Diplomatic Review
will be found Russian secret dispatches, together with other rare and
interesting documents on the history of Europe from the time of the
Protocol of April 4, 1826, for the “‘ Pacification of Greece,” to the end of
the Servian war, in 1876. Besides these scarce documents, the Diplo-
matic Review contains many original works of Mr. Urquhart, and a mass
of the transactions of the Foreign Affairs Committees of Workingmen
formed by him at the time of the Crimean war.

Among these papers.the following may be mentioned: Will of Peter
the Great. brought to Paris by the Chevalier d’Eon in 1757; Dangerto
the Political Balance of Europe, by Gustavus III, King of Sweden,
1791; Protocol of a Conference at Constantinople between the British
Ambassador and the Divan on the Connexion of Russia with the Greek
Revolt, 1822; Memoir of Count Bernstorff to the King of Prussia on
the means of annexing the Minor German States, 1831, &e.

On the 18th of April, 1885, in pursuance of the above-mentioned
notice, a printed circular was sent to over 400 of the principal libraries,
educational institutions, and kindred establishments, to the following
effect:

This Institution is informed by the Conductors of The Diplomatic Review of England,
that ‘‘a set of the twenty-five volumes of the Review, stitched and wrapped in seven
books,” will be presented to your library ‘‘on the condition of your binding them, so
that they may be safely preserved for reference.”

The Diplomatic Review extends trom the 13th of October, 1855, to the 3d of Jan-
uary, 1877, and contains rare and interesting documents relative to the history of
Europe from 1826 to 1876. It is proper to notify you that the successive volumes were
printed in different sizes;

Book I is in folio, and comprises two volumes.

Books II, II, and IV. are quarto, comprising sixteen volumes.

Books V, VI, and VI, are octavo, comprising seven volumes, and supplement.

Please notify this Institution whether this offer is accepted by your library; or, if
you have already received a set, whether you desire another on the same terms.

Replies to the above were received as follows: 236 accepted the en-
tire set; 8 desired portions to complete partial sets previously received,
and 43 declined, generally on the ground that the character of the in-
formation contained in the Review did not come within the scope of
the library. Quite a number of libraries have not noticed the cireular
or the offer contained.

A list was prepared, and sent to Mr. C. D. Collet, of those libraries
which accepted, and inasmuch as the sets were all declared to be more
or less incomplete, preference was given to the more important libra-
ries, in order that the volumes might reach the greatest number of
readers.

Newfoundland Postage on Exchanges.—An arrangement has been made
with the postmaster-general of Newfoundland by which all matter re-
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

lating to the exchange system shall be passed through the mails under
frank of the Smithsonian Institution, the chief clerk of which certifies
to the contents of each package.

Zoological Specimens for the Museum, contributed by Menageries.—For a
number of years the Institution has been indebted to the proprietors of
the menageries of the country for the contribution of animals dying
from disease or otherwise while in their charge, the principal establish-
ments in this connection being those of Messrs. Barnum, Bailey, and
Hutchinson; Mr. Adam Forepaugh; the Central Park Menagerie, in
charge of Mr. W. A. Conklin; and the Zoological Gardens at Philadel-
phia, under the direction of Mr. A. E. Brown.

From time to time specimens have been received in this way, and thus
a large number of highly-prized additions have been made. The addi-
tional advantage of having them in the flesh in more or less perfect con-
dition, enables them to be mounted under the best possible auspices.

In order to make some return to the contributors, the Institution
offered to have post-mortem examinations instituted of specimens re-
ceived, and the cause of death or disease reported to the senders. For
this purpose the co-operation of the Army Medical Museum was in-
voked and was cheerfully rendered, and an examination of each subject
received is usually made under the direction of Dr. John S. Billings.

The National Museum reserves the skins and skeletons, while the
Army Medical Museum makes any preparations of the viscera, &c.,
that may be desired by it.

NECROLOGY.

From among those connected with the Institution, I have but one
death to record.

EDWARD FOREMAN, M. D., was born in Baltimore, October 29, 1808.
After reaching manhood, he was for 12 years an assistant professor in
the University of Pennsylvania. In 1848, he was appointed an assist-
ant in the Smithsonian Institution by Professor Henry. He was en-
gaged in organizing the meteorological system established by the In-
stitution, and rendered efficient service in this department; and also
in conducting the correspondence and arranging the details of the
scientific lectures. In 1852 he accepted the position of chief examiner
in the Patent Office, which he retained for eight years. In 1874 he re-
turned to the Smithsonian Institution as an assistant in the ethnologi-
cal division of the National Museum. His death occurred April 14,
1885, at his residence in this city.

MISCELLANEOUS.

The Tyndall Trust Fund.—It will be remembered that when Prof.
John Tyndall of the Royal Institution of Great Britain, at the solicita-
tion of scientific friends in this country, made a visit to it in the latter
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

part of 1872, for the purpose of delivering in a few of our principal cities
courses of lectures on physical science, he very generously presented
the entire net proceeds of his lectures to trustees for the purpose of pro-
moting science in this country. These popular lectures, eloquently pre-
sented and admirably illustrated experimentally, were attended by large
and appreciative audiences in Boston, New Haven, New York, Brook-
lyn, Philadelphia, Baltimore, and Washington.

Professor Tyndall’s trust deed, executed in New York, February 7,
1873, just before his departure for England, was forwarded with a
friendly personal letter of the same date, to Professor Henry of this In-
stitution, and was published in full in the Smithsonian Report of 1872,
pages 104-106. By this grant it was found that he assigned to our peo-
ple the liberal fund of $13,033, in the following gracious terms,—omitting
here all but the more essential passages :

“As an evidence of my good-will toward the people of the United
States, I desire to devote this sum of $13,033 to the advancement of
theoretic science and the promotion of original research, especially in
the department of physics, in the United States.

“To accomplish this object I hereby appoint Prof. Joseph Henry, Sec-
retary of the Smithsonian Institution, Washington City, D. C., Dr. E.
L. Youmans, et New York, and General Hector Tyndale, of Philadelphia,
to act as a board of trustees to take charge of the above sum—to care-
fully invest it in permanent securities; and i further direct that the
said board shall, for the present, appropriate the interest of the fund
in supporting or in assisting to support, at such European universities
as they may consider most desirable, two American pupils who may
evince decided talents in physics, and who may express a determina-
tion to devote their lives to this work. My desire would be that each
pupil should spend four years at a German university—three of those
years to be devoted to the acquisition of knowledge, and the fourth to
original investigation.

‘‘ If however in the progress of science in the United States, it should
at any time appear to the said board that the end herein proposed
would be better subserved by granting aid to students, or for some
special researches in this country, the board is authorized to make the
appropriations from the income of the fund for such purposes.

‘‘T further direct that vacancies which may occur in said board, by
death or otherwise, shall be filled by the president of the National
Academy of Sciences.”

Even with the wise and far-seeing provision for discretion of judg-
ment vested in the trustees by the donor, they experienced much
greater difficulty in satisfactorily carrying into effect the enlightened
purpose of the grant than could have been anticipated. One promising
student, in the uncertainty of devoting his life to the career of scientific
research contemplated, very honorably returned to the trustees the sum
advanced to him. Another, after hesitating as to the condition of re-
maining for four years in a German or other European university,
finally declined to avail himself of the opportunity afforded him. It
thus resulted, from the conscientious administration of the trust, and
the earnest desire of the trustees to execute the expressed wishes of
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Professor Tyndall, that but a small portion of the income of the fund
has been expended, and the original sum has been thereby augmented.

On the death of two of the trustees—Professor Henry, at Washing-.

ton, and General H. Tyndale, at Philadelphia,—Dr. F. A. P. Barnard, of
New York, and Prof. Joseph Lovering, of Cambridge, Mass., were duly
appointed as their successors; and how judiciously the trustees have
continued to husband the resources committed to them is sufficiently
evinced by the remarkable fact that the Tyndall fund has now ac-
cumulated, by the constaut addition to it of the unappropriated income,
from the original sum of $13,000, to $32,000.

Under these circumstances the distinguished donor has been induced
to modify the original conditions of the gift, so as to divide the in-
creased principal into three separate funds (of nearly $11,000 each), and
to give the charges thereof, respectively, to Harvard College at Cam-
bridge, Columbia College at New York, and the University of Pennsyl-
vania at Philadelphia, for the perpetual maintenance in each of these
institutions of learning, of a graduate fellowship in the department of
physics. There can be little doubt that this change of the direction
was, under the peculiar circumstances, eminently judicious; and that
the several endowments will constitute brilliant pmzes to aspiring
American students, and will greatly contribute to the noble purpose of
their founder—the stimulation of original research, and the advance-
ment of physical science in the United States.

UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Arrangement of material.—The regular work of the Museum has been
considerably interrupted during the six months now under consideration
by the participation of the Museum in the World’s Industrial and Cotton
Centennial Exposition at New Orleans. Several members of the staff
were in attendance at this exposition, in custody of the collections of the
Museum there displayed, and in May and June ten curators and me-
chanics were sent to New Orleans to attend to the re-packing and for-
warding of the collections sent by the Smithsonian Institution, as well
as to care for the numerous exhibits transferred to the Museum by for-
eign and domestic exhibitors at the close of the exposition. The extent
of these accessions was very considerable. One hundred and seventy-six
thousand pounds of exhibits were sent to New Orleans. Of this amount
138,624 pounds were sent direct, 19,814 pounds from Cincinnati, and
17,631 pounds from Louisville, at each of which places the Smithsonian
Institution had displayed large exhibits during the summer of 1884
320,744 pounds were returned, including 51,267 pounds received from the
State Department, whose valuable exhibit, gathered by the United States
consuls all over the world, was transferred in bulk to the National Mu-
seum with the understanding that a limited number of loan exhibits
were reserved for return to their owners. Besides this amount, 74,489
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27

pounds were acquired by gifts from Mexico and other sources. In ad-
dition to the collections consigned directly to the Museum from New
Orleans, theimportant collection illustrating the uses of American woods,
gathered for the exhibit of the Agricultural Department by Mr. William
Saunders, has, since its receipt in Washington, been delivered to the
Museum. At the beginning of July a considerable portion of the collec-
tions had already been received, and many of the exhibition halls of the
‘Museum, which before this time had been reduced to an appearance of
order, were becoming filled up with the unopened boxes and cases. Itis
however confidently expected that before the end of the calendar year
the new material will be unpacked and brought under control. A
special appropriation of $7,500 was made by Congress for the packing
and forwarding of the new material, and for repairing and reinstalling
the original collection. The New Orleans Exposition, although its in-
fluence was perhaps less comprehensive than that at Philadelphia in
1876, has nevertheless accomplished a great work in the South and
West, both from commercial and educational standpoints, and in my
judgment the money appropriated for the display of the Smithsonian
Institution (including the United States National Museum and Fish
Commission) has been productive of important results to the country.
There can be no doubt that the National Museum has been the gainer
by the undertaking, although the work of final arrangement has re-
ceived a temporary set-back.

The general work of the Museum has been for the most part of the
same character as that described in my reports for the last three years,
and in tlearly every department the curator states that decided progress
has been made in the development both of the study and the exhibition
series of specimens. The work of case-construction has been steadily
carried forward, and during the coming year the collections will be more
thoroughly classified than has hitherto been possible, by the assignment
of definite space for each department in the exhibition balls. The gal-
leries of the main exhibition hall in the Smithsonian building have been
cleared of the old exhibition cases, which proved to be inadequate to
present needs, and the space is being used temporarily for the overhaul-
ing and arrangement of certain large collections in the departments of
birds, mollusks, marine invertebrates, invertebrate paleontology, and
ethnology. ‘This step has been found absolutely necessary, since the
space in the crowded laboratory rooms was not sufficient to admit of
any general rearrangement.

Museum Publications.—The various publications of the Museum have
been, as hitherto, under the editorial supervision of Dr. Tarleton H.
Bean. The seventh volume of the “Proceedings” was finished in Feb-
ruary, and of the eighth volume, the printing of which was begun in
March, 221 pages were printed prior to the Ist of July. At the present
time four Bulletins are in the hands of the printer, No. 23, ‘ Biblio-
graphy of the Publications of Isaac Lea, LL. D., by Newton Pratt

rough skeletons,” by Frederic A. Lucas, have also been published.

The publication of the special report upon the fisheries of the United
States, in quarto, which, in addition to its descriptive, historical, and
statistical contents, will in reality constitute a monograph of the Amer-
ican portion of the fisheries collection in the Museum, has been going
through the press under the supervision of the Assistant Director and
Mr. A. H. Clark, who are rendering this service to the Fish Commission
as volunteers.

Museum Library.—The accessions to the Museum library, including
books and pamphlets, have been 454. Early in the year Mr. H. W.
Spofford was appointed assistant to Mr. F. W. True, the librarian.

Visitors.—The total number of visitors to the National Museum dur-
ing the first half of 1885 was 107,365, a daily average of 6922.

Meetings in the Lecture Hall.—The lecture hall, as in previous years,
has been used for the meetings of several societies, viz, the National
Academy of Sciences, the American Fisheries Society, the Biological
Society of Washington, the Society of Naturalists of North America,
and the Entomological Society of Washington.

Saturday Lectures.—Twelve Saturday lectures, under the auspices of
the Biological and Anthropological Societies of Washington, were de-
livered in the lecture hall on successive Saturday afternoons, and were
well attended. Many of these lectures had direct reference to the work
of the Museum, and were illustrated by specimens from the cases.

Museum Report.—A special report upon the Museum having been or-
dered by Congress, the reports of the Assistant Director and curators
for the year 1884, together with the accompanying statistics and the
scientific papers based upon the collections in the National Museum,
have been in a measure separated from the regular Smithsonian report,
forming Part II of the same, and being arranged in a separate volume.

In accordance with my custom in previous years, I shall here present
a brief review of what has been accomplished in each department, refer-
ring to the special Museum report for the full discussion of the additions

*These form Parts II and III of ‘‘ Bibliographies of American Naturalists,” and are

mic geology, Fred. P. Dewey, curator. The departments of explora-
tion and field-work, chemistry, experimental physiology, and vivaria
are still unorganized. These twenty-seven departments and sections
are administered by twenty-four curators, honorary curators, and act-
ing curators, of which number at present only nine receive salaries
from the Museum appropriation. Of the remaining fifteen, five are of-
ficers connected with the Geological Survey; one, an officer of the Bureau
of Ethnology; two, officers of the Fish Commission ; two, officers in the
United States Army ; one, an officer in the United States Navy; one,
au Officer in the Agricultural Department; and one, professor of chemis-
try in Wesleyan University ; the remaining two are Museum officers,
but receive no salaries for their work in administering upon thé special
collections under their charge.

Department of Arts and Industries.—In the department of arts and
industries several sections have already been organized ; that of Materia
Medica, under the charge of Dr. H. G. Beyer, U. S. N., who has been de-

tailed for this service by the Surgeon-General of the Navy, is in excel-
lent condition, and the collection is the most extensive of its kind in
America. The work of labelling has been finished, and during the year
the exhibition series will be extended and rearranged. Dr. Beyer is
prosecuting a chemical investigation of the different species of cinchona
barks in the collection, numbering over one hundred, and has made
some important determinations of the alkaloids of some cinchona barks
from new regions in Guatemala and Costa Rica. He hasalso carried on
investigations upon the physiological actions of atropia, cocaine, and
caffeine, on the circulatory apparatus, the results of which have already
been published in the ‘ American Journal of the Medical Sciences.”
Other experiments on the action of atropine on the heart and of blood
at different temperatures on the same, have been discussed in the Pro-
ceedings of the Museum.

In the section of foods, under the honorary curatorship of Professor
Atwater, some progress has been. made in the work of building up a
collection illustrating the physiological action of foods and the composi-
tion of the human body, similar to the famous collection in the Bethnal
Green Museum,in London. Mr. Hitchcock, who is acting curator of this
collection, has, however, devoted most of his time to the development of
the section of textiles, which is directly under his charge. This section
has been largely increased by donations from abroad, but especially
through collections made by himself while preparing for the Exposition
at New Orleans. The object of these collections is twofold, first, to af-
ford an exhibit of the various textile fibers available for use in this coun-
try and abroad, with specimens of articles made therefrom, such as cloth,
rope, twine, mats, &c.; second, to provide a series of specimens of every
fiber that can be used in the arts, to be used for scientific examination,
tests of tensile strength, and especially to serve as type specimens
for the identification of other fibers by microscopical examination. A
number of collections which have been received are worthy of special
mention. Among these, a particularly fine set of fibers from Brazil,
collected by Dr. J. Carlos Berrinni, of Quissaman, who has devoted un-
usual care and labor to the work. All the textile fibers in the Museum
of the Department of Agriculture were placed in Mr. Hitchcock’s charge
during January, and from this collection some valuable specimens have
been selected and placed on exhibition. Mr. George W. Bond, of Boston,
has selected a large collection of native and foreign wools from samples
belonging to the United States customs department which have been pre-
pared for exhibition; they are not yet on exhibition, as the cases
for their display have not been made. This collection is probably al-
ready the best thing of the kind to be found m any museum, and when all
the wools belonging to the Museum collections are mounted, the display
of this textile will be, if not quite complete, at least very large and valua-
ble. Owing to the restricted floor space in the Museum which has been
assigned to this department, it has been impossible to make the display

‘of specimens as instructive and attractive as it might be. By far the
greater part of the collection, and some of the most interesting speci-
mens, have been sent to the Exposition at New Orleans, where this de-
partment was well represented. A detailed account however of the
display there made would not be of interest in this report, and the sub-
ject may be passed over with the statement that there were sent to
New Orleans 290 unit boxes to represent the textiles department of
the Museum. The display is said to have been very attractive. Mr.
Hitchcock has also been requested to take charge of the physical ap-
paratus belonging to the Smithsonian Institution which has been trans-
ferred to the National Museum and placed in cases. The arrangement
has been necessarily very unsystematic, owing to the limited space at
his disposal, but in a general way it is classified under three heads,
namely, apparatus for experiments on (1) sound, (2) heat and light,
and (3) electricity. A list of the instruments in this collection (which
is of interest as having been used by Professor Henry) is in course of
preparation. In connection with it may be mentioned the relics of
electrical and chemical apparatus of Dr. Joseph Priestley, which is on
exhibition in the same place.

The collection of historical relics has received but little attention
daring the six months, and no effort is at present being made to increase
its extent. Perhaps no part of the Museum is more attractive to visitors
than that in which the relics of General Washington are displayed, and
itis believed that the section of historical relies will receive from year to
year a constant increment of valuable memorials of the past. The heirs
of General Robert E. Lee have presented a claim for the recovery of
articles of furniture removed from Arlington in 1862, and since then on
exhibition with the Washington relics at the Patent Office and in the
Museum. Most of these appear never to have been the property of
General Washington. They will however be held in the Museum until
official instructions for their delivery have been received.

There has been little activity in connection with the section of fish-
eries, the section of naval architecture, and the collection of musical
instruments, all of which are however in excellent order and have
been considerably extended, though without direct effort.

An illustrated catalogue of the Catlin collection of Indian paintings
has been prepared by Mr. Thomas Donaldson, and will soon be offered
for publication.

Mr. J. E. Watkins, of Camden, N. J., who is one of the leading au-
thorities in the country upon the history of railroads and steam trans-
portation, and who is indorsed by many of the leading railroad men of
the country, was appointed in June honorary curator of the section of
steam transportation. It is intended, as opportunity offers, to gather
in the Museum a collection of objects illustrating the history of Amer-
ican railroads and steamboats, with a view to preserving permanently
the memorials of the growth of this most important interest which has
\

32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

been so closely connected with the material progress of the United
States. Several important specimens have already been received,
notably the “‘John Bull” locomotive engine, which was built in 1831
in England by George and Robert Stephenson for the “Camden and Am-
boy Rail and Tramway Company,” by which this engine was used from
1831 to 1861. This is now stored at the Armory building, but will be
placed on exhibition as soon as proper space can be provided.

Department of Ethnology.—The Curator of this department, Prof. Otis
T. Mason, having gathered the ethnological material belonging to the
Museum during the last half of 1884, commenced in 1885 its methodical
arrangement. The basketry, throwing-sticks, sinew-backed bows, and
the whole series of arrows, have been studied and classified, so as to
illustrate their distribution, tribal characteristics, and evolution. It is
designed to continue this system in the remaining portions of the col-
lection, with the view of better unfolding through the arts of savagery
the origin and development of civilization.

During the past six months the Curator made two official visits to the
New Orleans Exposition, for the purpose of securing for the National
Museum some of the material exhibited by the Departments of the Gen-
eral Government and of foreign countries. By this means the Museum
has obtained a large number of accessions. “Material of especial value
was also received from Rev. O. H. A. Dall, of Calcutta; Rev. Dr. George
W. Samson; Mr. James Stevenson, of the Bureau of Ethnology, and
others, which will be fully described in the Report on the National Mu-
seum. ;

Mr. William H. Holmes, of the Bureau of Ethnology, has continued
the installation of aboriginal pottery, directing his efforts chiefly to la-
belling, cataloguing, and classifying the accessions received in the sum-
mer and fall of 1884. The very extensive collections of Pueblo material
made for the World’s Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition in
New Orleans, arrived too late to be made fully available for exhibition,
but a small representative series of vessels and other objects of clay
was forwarded to New Orleans. The collection of ancient pottery, re-
cently obtained from Chiriqui, Panama, and partly paid for from the
exposition funds, was also represented. The most important accessions
have been from the explorations ot Mr. L. H. Aymé, in Mexico. It is
hoped that a portion, at least, of the pottery court will be opened to
the public by the end of the present calendar year.

Department of Antiquities——Dr. Charles Rau has continued his work
in the department of antiquities, carrying on toward completion the
system of arrangement which he began ten years ago. He reports im-
portant aecessions from the Bureau of Ethnology; from explorations of
Edward Palmer in Arizona; from Oaxaca, Mexico, by L. H. Aymé; from
Costa Rica, by J. C. Zeledon; and from the island of Guadaloupe by L.
Guesde. An exceedingly valuable collection of casts of the antiquities
of Mexico and Yucatan has been deposited in the Museum by Sefior
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. SO

Eufemio Abadiano, of Mexico, by whom they were made. This collec-
tion includes full-size reproductions of several exceedingly important ob-
jects, such as the Mexican Aztec Calendar Stone, the Sacrificial Stone,
the Aztec Goddess of Death (Teoyoamiqui), and the wonderful reclining
figure of Chac-Mool. This collection has been forwarded from New Or-
leans and will soon be on exhibition, and it is hoped that by some means
it may ultimately become the property of the Museum. It will be in-
stalled by the side of the Lorillard collection and other Central Amer-
ican antiquities. These two collections of casts, together with the orig-
inals already in possession of the Museum, will entirely fill one of the
small exhibition galleries and constitute a display of native American
sculpture and architecture which is equalled nowhere else in the world.

Department of Mammals.—At the beginning of the year the work of
the mammal department, incident upon the preparation of a collection
to be exhibited in New Orleans, having been entirely completed, the
regular routine work was resumed. The mammal exhibition hall had
been rendered less attractive than formerly by the removal of numerous
large specimens for the New Orleans Exposition, and a temporary re-
arrangement of the collections was attempted in order to make the
vacancies less conspicuous. During the first quarter of the year thirty-
three mounted specimens were added to the exhibition series, including
several large forms, such as a Siberian sheep, a baboon, &e. A list of
all the mounted mammals was made in February, and soon afterwards
temporary labels were written and distributed among the specimens.
Manuscript for printed labels for the entire’ series was also prepared.

In April the director of the Museum offered a reward for the capture
of a specimen of a spotted dolphin, said to be abundantin the Gulf of
Mexico. A freshspecimen was soon afterwards received through Messrs.
Warren & Stearns, of Pensacola, Fla., and proved to be of remarkable
scientific interest. On the 9th of April three telegrams were received
from life-saving station keepers announcing the stranding of cetaceans,
two having reference to blackfish stranded near Cape Henry, and the
third to a fin-back whale ashore near Truro, Mass. The most interesting
cetacean specimens received during the half-year were a male pygmy
sperm-whale (Kogia) and the skull of an Atlantic right-whale (Balena
cisarctica).

Messrs. Barnum, Bailey, and Hutchinson, Mr. Adam Forepaugh, and
the authorities of the Philadelphia Zoological Gardens (through Mr. A.
EK. Brown), and the Central Park Menagerie (through Mr. W. A. Conk-
lin), have continued to send many interesting animals in the flesh.

In June the chief taxidermist was ordered to New Orleans to super-
intend the packing of the mammals exhibited in that city. During his
stay he negotiated an exchange in behalf of the Museum by which three
valuable species of quadrumana were acquired, including a specimen of

the interesting gibbon, Hylobates concolor. The New Orleans exhibit

was not received at the Museum until after the 1st of July. (Fora de-
tailed account of this collection see Museum Report, 1884, p. 129.)

At the beginning of the year an office and a commodious laboratory
in the southwest pavilion of the Museum building were assigned to this
department. The collections are thereby made more accessible than
formerly.

Department of Birds.—Mr. Ridgway, curator of birds, reports that by
direction he prepared for exhibition at the New Orleans World’s Cotton
Exposition a collection of North American game birds, numbering 163
finely mounted specimens, and representing nearly all the species. The
exhibit was at first intended to be much more comprehensive, the original
plan being to exhibit all the known species of North American birds, so
far as they could be secured, together with typical groups to illustrate
the avian fauna of the several zo0-geographical divisions of the earth’s
surface. To this end more than 700 specimens were mounted on special
contract, it being impossible to make up a suitable collection from the
birds already mounted. The collection had been nearly completed on the
original plan when it became necessary, on account of the limited space
available, to make the great reduction which ensued. This collection
was installed by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, assistant curator, who for the
purpose left Washington January 3, and returned on the 16th of the
month. Dr. Stejneger reports that “in regard to completeness, perfec-
tion of mounting and preservation, scientific exactness, and popular in-
structiveness,” this collection “ was superior to any other ornithological
exhibit at the exposition.” The collection filled two double Museum
cases, fitted with two rows of terraced. shelves, the exhibition surface
amounting to a little over 600 square feet. Each specimen was mounted
on a stand of polished black walnut, and provided with a printed label
on which were printed in large, clear type both the scientific and popular
names. The curator also calls attention to the “ American Ornitholo-
gists’ Union,” which was formed at the urgent request of the various
ornithological interests of the country for the main purpose of harmon-
izing existing differences in the nomenclature of North American birds,
and thereby removing the most serious obstacle to the study of ornithol-
ogy. Atthe meeting of organization in New York City a “ committee on
classification and nomenclature” was formed, of which the curator of the
department of birds of the United States National Museum was made a
member ; and this committee, in pursuance of a call from the chairman,
held a meeting in Washington, from the 15th to the 23d of April, inclu-
Sive, in the oflice of this department, the collections of which weré ap-
pealed to in all cases where there was a difference of opinion among mem-
bers of the committee, and many perplexing problems were settled to the
satisfaction of the committee as a whole. The importance to ornithol-
ogy of this meeting, together with one held the previous year in the office
of this department. can searcely be overstated, the whole subject of zo-
ological nomenclature having been exhaustively reviewed and a care-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ay

fully prepared code adopted, in which the satisfactory rules of the exist-
ing codes were adopted and their unwieldy provisions rejected. This
new code has been the guide of the committee in the preparation of a
new list of North American birds, and will, without much doubt, be
adopted by zoologists generally. The curator having been charged by
the above-mentioned committee with the determination of names of
North American birds according to the new code of nomenclature, this
* duty has been carefully performed, and the copy for the new list put in
the hands of the president of the union. At this date the list is being
printed. The naturalists of the United States Fish Commission steamer
Albatross having made an extensive collection of birds on the almost
unknown island of Cozumel, off the coast of Yucatan, it became the
duty of the curator, as a part of his official work, to determine the spe-
cies and describe those which proved new to science. The latter were
no less than nineteen in number, of which the greater part have already
been published, while the remainder are described in a full report upon
the collection now being printed as a part of Volume VIII of the ++ Pro-
ceedings of the National Museum.” ‘The offer of the mounted birds—
which had for some years been on exhibition in the museum of the De-
partment of Agriculture, having been accepted by the National Museum,
the transfer of the specimens to the Smithsonian building was effected
during the month of May. This collection, numbering 712 specimens, con-
sisted largely of common North American birds, the mounting of which
was not up to the standard required for exhibition in the Museum col-
lection. Being however suitable for purely educational purposes, this
surplus stock is at present being made up into sets for distribution to
schools or other public educational establishments which may require
such material. - The remainder of the collection, consisting of a very
good series of the different varieties of the domesticated fowl and a
smaller number of specimens of exotic Phasianide, has been properly
arranged for exhibition in the Museum cases. Mr. Ridgway reports the
accession of 3,681 specimens of birds and 185 specimens of nests and
eggs.

Department of Fishes.—Dr. Tarleton H. Bean, curator of the department
of fishes, reports 297 entries on the catalogue. The most important collec-
tions were made, as usual, by the vessels of the United States Fish Com-
mission. The Albatross collections which are discussed in the Museum
report are very large and important. ‘The curator was aboard this
steamer from the 3d of January to the 20th of February, during her work
off the southern coast, and in the West Indies, Caribbean Sea, and the Gulf
of Mexico, up to the time of her arrival at New Orleans. He was sent out
to make observations upon the living specimens of the deep-sea fishes
and upon the southward range of the east coast food-fishes. During the
week spent at the island of Cozumel he had opportunity, incidentally,
of aiding Mr. Benedict in securing a large series of the birds of that
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

island, while the seining for fishes along the shore yielded 57 species.
At New Orleans a short time was spent in attaching descriptive labels
to casts of fishes in the Exposition.

Department of Comparative Anatomy.—This department is under the
care of Mr. F. W. True, curator of mammals. Early in the year a number
of exhibition cases were set up in the east south range, and in the latter
part of February a provisional arrangement of the exhibition series of
vertebrate skeletons was effected. A month later the entire collection of
bird skeletons was brought from the Smithsonian building and stored in
the range. An arrangement was made with the authorities of the Army
Medical Museum for the exchange of a collection of human skulls for
skeletons and skulls of North American vertebrates, and in April the
first in stallment, consisting of about 500 skulls and 550 skeletons of
North American vertebrates, was transferred to the United States Na-
tional Museum. An agreement was also entered into between the Army
Medical Museum and the National Museum to undertake post-mortem
examination of animals in the flesh received by the Institution, and of
which the donors desired to know the cause of death. <A series of casts
of bones of Dinoceras, presented by Prof. O. C. Marsh, was also placed
on exhibition. The osteological preparator and his assistant were con-
stantly engaged in cleaning skeletons and: mounting them for exhibi-
tion. One of the most interesting of the recently exhibited skeletons is
that of Khytina gigas, obtained in Bering Island by Dr. L. Stejneger for
the Institution. Some progress has been made in the preparation of a
series of specimens illustrative of the modifications of the limbs and
other portions of the skeletons in the different classes of vertebrates.
Iixperiments in special cases for the exhibition of this and other simi-
lar series have proved very successful. But little work has been done
in connection with the reserve series except for the purpose of deter-
mining whether the specimens were in good order.

Department of Mollusks.—This department has been making extra-
ordinary progress under the charge of Mr. William H. Dall, assisted by
Dr. RK. E.C. Stearns. Mr. Dall reports that the department under his
charge has been making steady advance in its administration upon the
mass of accumulations of the last ten years, and, except in regard to the
New Orleans exhibit, has little more to offer than a record of such un-
eventful work which is indispensable for making the collections useful
. for the paleontologist or the conchologist who may desire to consult it.
The most interesting accession was a small lot of Japanese shells con-
tributed by Mr. Uchimura, which contains several great rarities. The
preparation of material for the New Orleans Exposition, which absorbed
several months’ time prior to the beginning of the year, was completed
under the direction of Dr. Stearns, so that the boxes containing the
specimens and the cases required for their display reached. their desti-
nation and were ready for arrangement early in January. About the
middle of the month Dr. Stearns proceeded to New Orleans and re-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37

mained there until the installation of this exhibit was completed. The
exhibit in this division of natural history probably surpassed, in extent
and general excellence, any previously made at any great lixhibition.
It was arranged in 21 table-cases, the specimens being placed in inside
trays and labelled. The general system followed was a geographical
one, and presented a characteristic representation of the more con-
spicuous and interesting forms of the various zoological geographical
provinces. The exhibit included several cases of the fresh-water mus-
sels of the Mississippi drainage area, which is remarkable for the great
number and beauty of the shells; also the rare and peculiar forms be-
longing to this group from other parts of the world. The land and pond
snails of the Mississippi basin were each represented by a separate case.
The marine shells of the Atlantic coast of America from the Arctic Sea
to the Caribbean, and the sea-shells of the Pacific coast from Bering Sea
to Panama, were also shown, including the principal species inhabiting
the tidal areas of Puget Sound to tbe north and the Gulf of California
to the south. Other cases contained selected specimens from the Indo-
Pacific region, such as live in the warm waters of tbe great coral areas
of the tropical and semi-tropical seas between the shores of Western
America and Eastern Asia. Four cases were devoted to the edible
mollusca of the United States. Two of these contained clams, cockles,
&c., of the Atlantic seaboard, and two cases were devoted to similar
forms peculiar to the coast of Western North America from Alaska to
San Diego, Cal. The systematic and critical selection of the foregoing
involved a great deal of work and the overhauling of a large quantity
of material, the accumulation of many years. This labor was however
incidentally advantageous to the Museum, as a considerable portion of
the work consisted in the examination and partial preparation of mol-
luscan material, hereafter to be incorporated in the national collection,
and of very. great importance for reference in connection with the study
of fossil forms of the Quaternary or even of the Tertiary age. Unlike
the results to some other departments of the Museum, the Exposition
contributed little or nothing to this section, and indeed the Museum
was the only contributor of an important molluscan exhibit.

Department of Insects.—Prof. C. V. Riley continues to perform the
duties of curator without assistance; but arrangements have been made
for the appointment of a paid assistant curator for the next fiscal year.
Professor Riley reports a number of important accessions, including a
large collection of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera sent from Sikkim by the
Rev. C. H. A. Dall, of Caleutta. A varied collection of insects was se-
cured by the United States Fish Commission steamer Albatross from
the West Indian region, and an important general collection of alco-
holie material was received from Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, U.S. A., stationed
at ort Wingate, New Mexico. The most valuable addition to the collee
tion during these six months, from a classificatory standpoint, however,
was the dipterological collection of Mr. Edward Burgess, treasurer of the
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Boston Society of Natural History, which was obtained by purchase ;
while the most valuable, from a popular and economic view, is the ex-
hibit collection prepared for the New Orleans Exposition. This has
been returned with little injury, and is only awaiting space for perma-
nent exhibition in the Museum. It is made up of the following material,
arranged in cases made on the same unit plan as those of the Museum:

(1) Insects injurious to Agriculture.—Arranged according to the partic-
ular plant and the particular part of the plant affected, and containing, as
far as possible, the different states of growth of the insect, its enemies
and parasites, a statement of the remedies or preventives available, and
a reference to the chief articles where full information can be found upon
it. These references are principally to Government and State reports,
to which the farmer will most likely have access.

(2) Insecticide Substances.—In the catalogue of this collection the aim
has been to add, as briefly as possible, a statement of the method of
using: such substances, so that whenever in the first section a particular
substance is recommended for a particular insect, the reader can turn
to this second section for further details.

(3) Insecticide Machinery and Contrivances for Destroying Insects.—In
the catalogue of this section there is also added such information as
will add to the instructive value of the exhibit, and a large proportion
of the more useful contrivances are such as have been designed and
perfected in the work of the entomological division, or of the United
States Entomological Commission during the past five years.

(4) Bee-culture.—This collection is designed to show all the more val--
uable methods and contrivances now in use among the advanced apia-
rians.

(5) Silk-culture.—In this collection the aim has been to make the exhibit
instructive rather than full in detail. The collection includes, in addi-
tion to the foregoing,a number of framed plates, both colored and plain,
which have been prepared in the work of the division; and a number of
Prof. Riley’s enlarged colored diagrams of some of the more important
injurious insects were also used. <A catalogue of this exhibit has been
published under the direction of the Department of Agriculture, giving
a full and detailed statement of its contents.

The routine work of the department has consisted in answering let-
ters and in acknowledging and determining accessions. A good deal
of work has also been done in the proper arrangement and classifying
of material, particularly in the Micro-Lepidopteraand in the Lepidoptera
generally. In this work Professor Riley was assisted by Mr. Albert
Koebele, who was detailed from the Department of Agriculture for the
purpose.

The researches in entomology have been made chiefly in connection
with Prof. Riley’s work for the Department of Agriculture; and some
of the results have been published in the bulletins and publications of
said Department.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

Department of Marine Invertebrates.—Mr. Richard Rathbun, curator,
reports that the most important addition to this department was made
by the United States Fish Commission steamer Albatross in April, on
her return from a three months’ cruise in the Gulf of Mexico, mainly
spent in investigating the grouper and red-snapper fishing grounds off
our southern coast. The collection turned over to the Museum was
much larger and eontained many more novelties than that made by
the Albatross in the same region and the Caribbean Sea the previous
year, and the unassorted materials filled nearly 1,000 packages of all
sizes. Of most interest was a series of several hundred specimens of
sea-lilies, mostly collected off Havana, Cuba, and representing the
various stages of growth of two species of Pentacrinus and of one of
Rhizocrinus. Over 30 species of Echini, or sea-urchins, were also con-
tained in the collection, and other divisions of the Echinodermata, as
well as the Celenterata, Crustacea, and Mollusca, were very fully rep-
resented. The bathymetrical range covered by these explorations ex-
tended from the shore level to a depth of 1,467 fathoms. Prof. A.
E. Verrill, of New Haven, has transferred to the Museum over 1,000
packages of identified specimens resulting from the explorations of
the Fish Commission in former years. Mr. Henry Hemphill continued
his collecting on the Florida coast, begun the previous winter, until
March of this year, and has contributed several cases of specimens
belonging to many groups. The other principal accessions have been
a fine series of the sea-urchins and star-fishes of the west coast of
Mexico from Mr. A. Forrer, numerous specimens of Pacific corals and
echinoderms from Dr. R. E. C. Stearns, and the collection of marine
invertebrates made by Lieut. George M. Stoney, U. 8. N., in Alaska,
in 1884. Much progress has been made in the determination and cat-
aloguing of specimens. Prof. Walter Faxon has completed his studies
of the collection of cray-fishes, which is now the second in the United
States in size and number of species, being exceeded only by that
at the Museum of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge. It contains 46
North American species. The collection of echini, which holds the
same relative rank, has also been almost completely identified, and other
groups are being rapidly worked over. In June the west hall of the
Smithsonian building, devoted to the exhibition of marine invertebrates,
was opened to the public, and elthough the collections now displayed
fill only the wall cases surrounding the room, they present a very credit-
able appearance, and all the groups belonging to this department are
represented to a greater or less extent. he dried collections not on
display have been mostly transferred to the northwest gallery of the
main hall, which will also serve as a general work-room for the depart-
ment. Soon after the middle of June the curator and his assistants
left for Wood’s Holl, Mass., to take part in the summer explorations of
the United States Fish Commission.
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Department of Invertebrate Fossils ( Paleozoic). —Mr. Charles D. Wal-
cott, honorary curator of this department, reports that his principal
work has consisted in identifying and labelling a collection of Carbon-
iferous fossils which were in the old Smithsonian collection. This work
is now well advanced, and will soon be completed as far as identifying
the species from the old records can be done. In the laboratory the
time of the curator has been chiefly devoted to ‘the preparation and
study of the Cambrian faunas of North America. This has been done
in connection with his work for the Geological Survey. A large num-
ber of types and a great quantity of specimens of described species
will be added to the Museum collections as a result of this work. A
number of minor accessions have been received from various persons
throughout the country. A large addition was made to the collection
in the latter part of 1884, a full discussion of which was presented in
the report for that year, and another valuable contribution from the
Geological Survey will probably be made in the latter part of the pres-
ent year.

Department of Invertebrate Fossils (Meso-cenozoic).— Dr. Charles A.
White, the honorary curator of this department, states that a number
of important accessions have been received during the first six months
of this year, and that some of them constitute new additions to the col-
lection. Descriptions of these have been published in the various bul-
letins of the United States Geological Survey. The work of preparing
the collections of the Museum has been in progress, and the installation
of types has been commenced. Since the beginning of the year con-
siderable space has been assigned to this department in the gallery of
the Smithsonian Institution, and the work of preparing materials for
exhibition has steadily progressed. The space in the southeast court
of the Museum building is occupied by specimens belonging to this de-
partment which have been turned over by the Geological Survey to
the Museum, and in this court the collections are prepared for instal-
lation.

Departments of Fossil and Recent Plants.—Prof. Lester F. Ward, cura-
tor, reports that the work of his department was exclusively confined
to fossil plants until near the close of the year 1884, and no collections
of recent plants were received until February last, when rooms were
assigned to him for the purpose, and the large Joad collection from
Kew was placed in his charge. With this Professor Ward joined his
own collection, consisting of nearly 5,000 species. The two collections
combined form a nucleus of not less than 14,000 species, including
twice as many herbarium specimens for a future herbarium. He sub-
mits the following suggestion:

‘‘ All botanical collections have for many vears been turned over to
the Department of Agriculture, to be cared for by the botanist of that

Department. When in 1881 I was requested to take charge of the
fossil plants of the National Museum, and consented to do so, I per-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 41

ceived at once the great inconvenience which this arrangement would
cause to the department of fossil plants. The collections of fossil plants
were largely undetermined, and required to be studied and identified.
Most of them were from recent formations, and represented types of veg-
etation still living, requiring constant comparison with the recent forms
to be seen in herbaria. Even the installation and care of those that were
named necessitated such comparison, and the difficulties of this nature
that were encountered were very great. It was rarely possible to carry
the fossils to the Department of Agriculture, and as it was usually
necessary to search through large families of plants, the temporary
transportation of the botanical specimens was still more impracticable.
I therefore early began to urge the establishment at the Museum of a
permanent collection of the plants still growing in America and other
countries where the analognes of fossil plants were likely to occur.
While I am highly gratified at the progress in this direction already
made, as reported above, it must however be evident that only a begin-
ning has thus far been made, and that the present collection of living
plants is still very inadequate. The Joad collection represents chiefly
the flora of Southern Europe, which is widely different from all Tertiary
floras, and especially so from the Cretaceous and Tertiary floras of North
America. The collections that I have made are exclusively American,
and, so far as they go, are valuable aids to the study of American fossil
plants, but they are, of course, too limited in extent to be trusted in
critical cases. The parts of the world next after those in North Ameri-
ca with which our fossil floras most closely agree, are Eastern Asia, the
East Indies, Australia, and South Africa, and from all these vast re-
gions scarcely any representatives are to be found in the present her-
barium of the National Museum. It is therefore highly desirable, as a
necessary adjunct to the department of fossil plants, and aside from
the still greater desideratum of establishing a truly national herbarium
at the Museum, that all reasonable efforts be made to enlarge and en-
rich the botanical collections.”

The technical botanical work of the department has been intrusted to
Mr. Frank H. Knowlton, who in addition to identifying and installing
the material, has devoted much time to bibliographical research, and to
the development of the sectional library. Very large collections have
been made by Mr. A. L. Schott during the spring and summer months
from the parks and gardens of the city. These collections are designed
primarily to aid in the preparation of a catalogue of the ornamental plants
of Washington, but while serving this purpose, they are at the same time
valuable accessions to the herbarium and highly useful in connection
with the study of fossil plants. In collecting and preserving these speci-
mens Mr. Schott has shown great industry and skill. In addition ta
this work Mr. Schott has undertaken the preparation of a cheek-list of
genera from the ‘Genera Plantarum” of Bentham and Hooker, of which
about half the manuscript was completed at the end of June. The time
of the curator was almost exclusively spent in the study and determina-
tion of fossil plants collected by himself, and over one hundred species,
many of which are new, were identified and will be duly incorporated
in the Museum collections,
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Department of Minerals.—This department has been under the charge
of Prof. F. W. Clarke, assisted by Mr. William S. Yeates. There have
been made during the first half of the year 554 entries, representing
2,137 specimens, all of which are new accessions, except 138 specimens
which were found in the old collections without evidence of having been
previously catalogued. Eighteen sets of minerals have been sent out
as exchanges, comprising about 1,200 specimens, and much valuable
material has been obtained in return. This department was represented
at New Orleans by collections of the minerals from which are obtained
gems and ornamental stones, and also by a collection of cut and polished
stones. These collections attracted the general attention of connois-
seurs and visitors at the Exposition. The minerals were classified after
Dana’s system, and were arranged in seven flat-top table-cases. The
gems were displayed in two cases, the specimens being mounted on
white and black velvet pads. This department did not secure a large
amount of new material from the New Orleans Exposition, most of the
mineral collections on exhibition belonging to private individuals, to
whom the agents were responsible for the safe return of their specimens:
One-half of the southwest court has been assigned to this department
as its exhibition space, and the collections have been removed thither.

Department of Lithology and Physical Geology—The curator, Mr.
George P. Merrill, was on duty at the New Orleans Exposition at the
beginning of the year, but has nevertheless accomplished very satis-
factory results in the work of reinstalling the collections upon the ex-
tended floor-space recently assigned to this department. The opening
of the year found the affairs of this department in a quiescent though
somewhat confused state, owing to the fact that since the preceding
July the entire energies of the working force had been devoted to the
preparation of the exhibit designed for the New Orleans Exposition,
and the regular work of the Museum had consequently fallen behind.
The special exhibit was completed late in December and the extra
hands discharged. This exhibit consisted of (1) a collection of 358
specimens of building and ornamental stones of the United States in
the form of four-inch cubes; (2) a collection of some 12 specimens of
foreign and native marbles in the form of polished slabs; (3) a collec-
tion of 150 specimens of rock-forming minerals; (4) a collection called
a “structural series,” intended to represent all the common forms of
’ rock structure and texture; (5) a collection of 198 specimens of rock
illustrating the geology and lithology of the Comstock lode and Wa-
shoe district, Nevada; and (6) a lithological collection comprising 500
specimens of various rocks; this last together with numbers 3 and 4
forming a part of the regular educational series of the Museum. As
these collections were all fully described in the report of this depart-
ment for 1884, no further reference to them in this place is necessary.
The large quantity of building-stone and other material occupying
the space in the southwest court, was removed and stored temporarily
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

in a shed outside the eastern entrance to the Museum, the court being
thus available for exhibition purposes. By a reassignment of exhibi-
tion space, the exhibition area of this department was made to include
the whole of the west-south range, instead of a portion of this range
and a portion of the court, as heretofore. The new arrangement is
vastly preferable both on account of the better light thus obtained and
of greater convenience in arranging and classifying the exhibit. In May
the force of the department was again increased by the addition of one
aid, one clerk, and three stone-cutters, and the preparation of a collec-
tion of building-stones commenced for the American Museum of Natural
History in New York. This collection will, when complete, comprise not
less than one thousand specimens, and an equal number of thin sections
for microscopical study. This work was still in progress at the end of
June. The number of entries in the department catalogue during the
six months has been 486, comprising some 700 specimens. These will
be fully described in the Museum report for the first half of 1885. Con-
siderable time has been devoted to the preparation of the various ex-
hibition series, particularly those included under lithology, and histori-
eal, dynamical, and structural geology. The last three are as yet far
from completion, and at the present rate of progress, which is neces-
sarily very limited, must so continue for several years. On this point
Mr. Merrill comments as follows:

“J may, perhaps, be pardoned for mentioning here the fact that from
past experience, | am convinced that the only satisfactory way in which
these last-named branches of my department can be built up, is to
allow the curator, or some experienced person, a certain sum of money
to be expended either in the purchase of collections under his direet
supervision, or of especially desirable material. A very considerable
portion of the material now necessary for this purpose is of such a
nature—principally on account of the bulk and weight of the speci-
mens—as to be beyond the scope of the ordinary collector, and in too
little demand to be found in many of the natural-history stores. I
might mention such examples as fault structure, examples of folds,
contortion, false bedding, &c., which can scarcely be obtained by other
than the means suggested.”

Department of Metallurgy and Economic Geology.—At the opening of
the year the curator, Mr. F. P. Dewey, was still detained at New Or-
leans, arranging the collection which had been sent from his depart-
ment to the Exposition, and he did not return to Washington till the
middle of January. The design of the special exhibit of this department
was to show, as far as the time and means at his disposal would per-
mit, the prominent occurrences of each metal, the methods of extract:
ing the metals from their ores, and the utilization of the metals. To
these were added a few illustrations of non-metallic ores and their
utilization, including a very extensive and valuable illustration of the
coal industry. Most of the ore material was selected from the Museum
collection, and only a very few new collections were made. These lat-
ter were taken upon a systematic plan representing the mine as a unit
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

rather than to gather a few specimens selected at random, as is usually
done. In following the plan, specimens were taken to represent sections |
across and up and down the vein, and to show an average of the product
of the vein, while to these were added the walls and other interesting
material. In representing the extraction and utilization of the metals,
tbe plan adopted was to begin with the ore as it leaves the mine, and to
follow it through the various steps in all the operations to the production
of the finished article, showing,when possible, every material entering into
each operation, as well as every product of each operation. In the case of
coal, the collections were based largely on the ethnological aspects of the
question, and thus included many specimens aside from those of an eco-
nomic or geological value. Throughout the new collections of the depart-
ment special attention has been paid to gathering as full and completea de-
scription of everything shown as possible, while the pictorial side of the
question has been treated very elaborately and includes some views of the
interior of a coal mine taken by electric light, the first views of the kind
ever produced. These collections form a basis for a full and complete rep-
resentation of the mineral resources of the country, and it is hoped that
they will increase until they shall have attained their highest educa-
tional value. They have been fully described in Museum Circular No.
dl. The regular force of the department having been redticed to a
scientific assistant and a laborer, the work of preparing the collections
in the Museum has been at a comparative stand-still during the first
half of the year. The laboratory of this department has been moved to
the second floor of the southwest pavilion, and the work-room on the
floor of the Museum has been cleaned out and space prepared for ex-
hibition purposes, so that now the entire work of preparing material for
exhibition has been concentrated into one place. The work of investi-
gating the New Orleans material has been carried on as far as practi-
cable, and, with the assistance of Mr. Allen, a number of very valuable
analyses have been made. A large number of accessions have been re-
ceived, among which may be specially mentioned a collection from the
Argo works, presented by Hon. N. P. Hill, a series donated by the
Copper Queen Company, and a series of apatite from many localities,
presented by Pickford & Winkfield, of London, England. In the middle
of May the curator returned to New Orleans to pack up the collection
and to solicit contributions for increasing the value of the permanent
collections. No attempt was made to obtain large, entire collections
without regard to their value to the Museum, requests being made
for material of only two classes, 7. e., that of intrinsic value, and such
as would fill gaps in our permanent collections. This effort was so
successful that much very valuable material was obtained and some
of the most important gaps were filled. Among the former should
be especially noticed the important and interesting collection received
from Mexico, and among the latter the valuable series of iron ores from
the Menominee region in Michigan. After the return of the curator to
REPORT OF THI; SECRETARY. 45

Washington in June, the collection presented to the Museum by the
American Institute of Mining Engineers, and which has for some years
been stored in Philadelphia, under the care of Mr. Thomas Donaldson,
commenced to arrive and claimed his attention during the remainder of
the fiscal year.

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

For continuing the prosecution of ethnological researches among the
North American Indians during the year 1885, under the general super-
vision of the Smithsonian Institution, an appropriation of $40,000 was
made by Congress. The charge of this interesting work—so valuable for
the advancement of anthropological knowledge—still remains under the
efficient direction of Maj. J. W. Powell.

The explorations in this field for the collection of information and
material, being mainly conducted during the summer months, the re-
sults cannot be collated and discussed till late in the fall. And as the
present report is brought down only to the Ist of July, a notice of the
operations of this Bureau for the year 1885 must necessarily be post-
poned until the next annual report.

UNITED STATES GEOLOGICAL SURVEY.

While this important branch of the public service is in its organiza-
tion entirely independent of the Smithsonian Institution, yet its inti-
mate relations to the latter, not only in the advancement of original
scientific research, but particularly in the valuable contributions made
by it to the stores of the National Museum, have seemed to justify an
annual summary of its general operations. Maj. J. W. Powell continues
to administer in a highly satisfactory manner the responsible duties of
his position as Director of the Survey.

In this department also, as in that last referred to, the field work is
still in progress at the closing of this report. And hence, for the rea-
son assigned, no details of the work and its results can here be given.
The character of the geological operations for the year will be concisely
presented in the report of 1885~86.

THE UNITED STATES FISH COMMISSION.

The work of the Commission has been prosecuted on about the same
scale as during the year 1884, the usual attention being paid to the pro-
duction of trout, salmon, whitefish, and other species, and to the gen-
eral investigations into the fisheries of the country.

The steamer Albatross, which was sent to the Gulf of Mexico, partly
to represent the United States Fish Commission at the New Orleans

Exposition and partly for the prosecution of research, was very success-
ful in her mission, attracting much attention at the exhibition, and
making many important explorations. .Included in these was a short
visit to Cozumel, an island off the coast of Yucatan, where many new
species of vertebrate animals were secured.

The investigations made at Wood’s Holl will be detailed in the next
report, as the work was begun after June 30, which represents the limit
of the present report.

REPORT ON SMITHSONIAN EXCHANGES, JANUARY 1 TO
JUNE 30, 1885.

By GrorGE H. BOEHMER.
OFFICE WORK.

On my return from an official mission to Europe as special agent for
the international exchange of official public documents of the United
States Government with foreign powers, to which position I had been
appointed by yourself, and at the request of Mr. Spofford, the Libra-
rian of Congress, on July 22, 1854, I resumed charge of the Exchange
Office on March 1, 1885. One of my first duties was the preparation of
reports to (1) the Smithsonian Institution, as the agent of exchange of
the United States Government, and (2) to the Library of Congress, as
the beneficiary under the Congressional act establishing this system of
exchange. The latter report is a manuscript of 620 pages of (42-line)
foolscap paper, and will in all probability be presented to Congress by
the Librarian of Congress through the Joint Committee on the Library.
The report to the Smithsonian Institution is a manuscript of over 500
pages foolscap, and comprises: (a) Letter of transmittal; (6) historical
sketch of international exchanges; (c) journal; (d) correspondence; (e)
bibliographical list of official and scientific publications made by the
Government departments and scientific and learned societies located in
Berlin, Germany. This list is as complete as could be collected during
the comparatively short sojourn in that city. Of this report only the
letter of transmittal, exhibiting a résumé in a condensed form of the
work performed, success attained, and certain observations made abroad,
will be given in the present statement, under the heading ‘“* Government
Exchange Division.”

Special attention had been given in .all the countries visited to the
collecting of reliable information and material to aid in the correction
of the “list of foreign correspondents.” In this endeavor 1 met with
the most generous assistance on the part of all officials to whom I made
known my wishes, and a full list of the co-operators in this enterprise
will be presented in the new and revised list prepared from the mate-
rial collected and now ready for publication. This new list comprises
over 4,000 titles, while the last one published by the Institution had
only 2,901. ae

The regular office work has received proper attention, and the first
six’ months of the present year close with a record never attained
before.

48 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

The Record Division.—The duties of this office have become so numer-
ous, that an additional assistant was this vear allowed. The work of
this division now embraces all the records and card catalogues under
the system adopted on the Ist of January, 1885. Under this system
all exchanges, whether incoming or outgoing, foreign or domestic, after
verifying the correctness of the sending, are entered on a blotter—this
work being done by the assistants in the foreign and domestic exchange
division, respectively ; these blotters are then transcribed by the clerks
of the record division in the day-book, from which the ledger, repre-
sented by a card catalogue, is posted. In addition to these duties, it
devolves on the clerks of this division to prepare the invoices for the
outgoing exchanges, and to credit on the ledger the acknowledgments
sent by recipients of exchanges, and to record and file letters, bills of
lading, &e.

The following statement exhibits the work done in this division dur-
ing the first six months:

TTerenin Hxechange Division.—Since January 1, 1885, 39,921 packages
have been received in this division and 383 boxes cote including the
Government exchanges. A comparative statement of boxes sent dur-
ing corresponding periods of former years present the following results :

The year 1884 exhibited an extraordinary inerease in the transmis-
sions, which was largely due to an arrangement for exchanges on the
part of the United States Patent Office with foreign Governments by
which 62 large cases were sent abroad through the Smithsonian Insti-
tution in June of that year. But notwithstanding this unusual send-
ing, the last six inonths show an inercase of 35 boxes over the similar
period of 1884. A detailed list will be presented in the statistics of
exchanges. }

Owing to the large addition in the work required under the present
system of preparing blotters, &e., and in consideration of the regular
increase both in incoming and outgoing exchanges, two (bempordiy)
assistants have been employed,

The Domestic Exchange Division.—The work performed in this division
between January 1, 1885, and June 30, 1885, is as follows:

While now, as compared with 1884, the number of packages distrib-
uted does not apparently present any marked increase, it must be re-
‘nembered that until the end of August, 1884, all books for the Smith-
sonian Institution, whether received by mail or otherwise, were entered
on the exchange record; but since then the books for the Smithsonian
Institution, coming by mail, were sent direct to the Smithsonian Li-
brary without passing through the exchanges. Thus, while the num-
ber of entries on the exchange records has apparently remained the same,
an increase has in reality taken place, the extent of which is represented
by the number of packages sent direct to the Smithsonian Library.

VISIY TO EUROPE.

The Government Buchange Division.—On the 22d of July, 1884, hav-
ing been appointed as special European agent of the Library of Con-
gress for exchanging the official publications of the United States Gov-
ernment for like publications of foreign Governments, in accordance
with the Congressional acts of March 2, 1867, and July 2, 1868, I ven-
ture to here present, as a concise statement of the business accom-
plished, a reproduction of the letter transmitting the formal report:

‘““Obediently to the instructions received, and provided with letters
of credence (1) from yourself to the correspondents of the Institution
abroad, (2) from Mr. Spofford, on behalf of the Library of Congress to
the officers in charge of Government exchanges in Hurope, and (3)
from the Department of State to the officers of the diplomatic and
consular corps of the United States in Europe, I left on my mission on
the 24th of July, 1884, and successively visited the executive depart-
ments of the following countries: Germany, Prussia, Saxony, Denmark,
Norway, Sweden, Finland, Russia, Austria, Hungary, Roumania, Ba-
varia, Switzerland, Wurtemberg, Belgium, Holland, Hngland, Italy, and
France (several of them repeatedly), obtaining immediate results far
above all expectations, and securing the promise of further valuable
returns. In most of the countries visited even the promise of two com-
plete sets of official publications has been secured, while the Govern-
ment of the United States furnishes only one single copy to each of the
exchanging states. Austria has been added to the list of exchanging
Governments, and Germany and Prussia are also expected to be repre-
sented in a decided majority of their respective publications.

“One of the paragraphs of instruction, specifying the kind of docu-

H. Mis. 15——4
50 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

ments especially desired by the Librarian of Congress, mentions, among

others—

‘‘(a) Complete sets of the laws of each country.

“(b) Journals, &e., of parliamentary bodies.

“(¢) Historical publications.

‘Tn compliance with this paragraph I desire to state that on the part
of all the Governments visited the promise has been cheerfully given
(including even that of Gerinany and Prussia), and a number of them
have already redeemed their promise. Large collections have been re-
ceived from the Governments of Sweden, Norway, Denmark, Hungary,

Saxony, Wurtemberg, Bavaria, Holland, Italy, France, and Switzer-,

Jand, while in furnishing collections of laws those of Wurtemberg and
Bavaria stand pre-eminent, the collection from the former extending
from the year 1289 to the present day. This is not a Government pub-
lization, but a private enterprise. The complete work had to be pur-
chased by the Government of Wurtemberg, and is now being presented
to the Government of the United States in appreciation of the many
and valuable documents presented under the Congressional act of Gov-
ernment documents exchange, while the collection from Bavaria com-
prises several hundred volumes. As regards historical publications the
Government of Switzerland stands pre-eminent in her promise to sup-
ply as complete a collection as can be obtained—a library in itself—
of the historical works of that Republic, while the Governments of
Saxony and Italy have already furnished some very valuable works.
Of other official publications a collection of 4,500 volumes of ‘“ Procés-
verbaux des conseils généraux des Départements Frangais,” received
from the French Government, may be named, while the offer of the
English Government of supplying the parliamentary papers from the
year 1817 to the end of 1881 also deserves mention.

“At first I met with great difficulties and vexations in carrying out the
designated plan of operations, mainly owing to the facts that all the
intercourse had been in a very indirect way of correspondence, and
that an agent of exchange had never visited the respective Govern-
ments, among whom some very singular ideas prevailed as to the true
position of the Library of Congress as regards this exchange, as well as
to its relative position to the Government of the United States and the
bodies representing the Government in its various branches, and in
consequence of which some very serious misapprehensions and miscon-
structions as regards the purpose of this exchange had occurred.

‘Another disadvantage which soon became painfully noticeable has
its origin in the entirely different organization and construction of the
exchange service of the European countries as compared with our own
system.

“While the United States Congress makes a liberal provision for the
printing and gratuitous.distribution of all official publications, from the
most inexpensive to the most costly production, in European countries
the respective governmental bureaus and departments relieve them-

oe
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 51

selves of any and all annoyances and cost attending the printing and
publishing of their various issues by giving the manuscript in com-
mission.to some enterprising and reliable publishing house. Thus the
work is at once thrown in the book trade and represents a commercial
value, and copies can only be supplied through the firm holding the
work on commission. The department may receive probably some 50
per cent. of the proceeds of the sales, which income greatly lessens the
cost of preparing the manuscript. The respective departments can
obtain copies only by purchase, and no legislation existing in those
countries like our Congressional act authorizing the exchange of official
documents, the one bureau, having undertaken the collecting and pro-
viding for the exchange with other Governments, has a very difficult
task in obtaining from the other departments the works required for
the purpose. It has no right to demand, but it is always the suppli-
cant for a favor, since such only it can be considered.

‘‘urthermore, the bureaus of exchange established (on the basis
adopted by the Paris convention in 1875) in a number of European
states are greatly restricted in their modus operandi by well-defined
laws, which prescribe distinctly that the official publications obtained
in the manner above described, and purchased from funds exclusively
allowed for the purpose, can be exchanged only for works of the same
(commercial) value. This, however, is a difficult matter in the case of
the United States publications, which represent no commercial value,
although they command very high figures in the book trade. Ibeg leave
here to quote from an English catalogue the prices of some of the more
important United States publications—the figures reduced to American
currency :

52 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

‘“‘ Herein, and in the misconceptions above stated, we ‘may find an
explanation of the scant returns the Government of the United States
has received and of the incompleteness of the series furnished; and
though, through the kind and hearty co-operation of our diplomatic and
consular officers, I finally succeeded in placing, for a time at least, the ex-
changes on asound basis, allow me to suggest that the means of securing
for the Government of the United States full returns for the liberal pro-
visions made for the exchange, and of reaping the benefit of the prom-
ises obtained from the European Governments in the execution of my
mission, can only be found in the establishment of a permanent agency
in Europe, a precedent for which we find in the Congressional act of
June 26, 1848, wherein Congress charged the Library Committee with
the nomination of an agent to conduct the operations of the exchange
between France and the United States, which ought to be intrusted to
a person entirely familiar with the business and its requirements, who
is to keep himself always informed as to the quality and quantity of
the publications made by the European Governments, and who should
be capable of judging and selecting from the works thus offered such
as would compensate the Government of the United States in the fullest
measure in an exchange, value for value, the value of the United States
publications being accepted as they are quoted in the book trade, for
the works sent abroad, in compliance with the Congressional acts es-
tablishing this exchange.”

EXTENSION OF THE SYSTEM OF EXCHANGES.

With two Governments preliminary arrangements have been made
for an exchange of official publications, the extent of which however
has not yet been fully decided on. These Governments are those of the
Republic of Uruguay and of the Empire of Austria. The correspondence

Inclosure from legation of Uruguay, New York, December 14, 1884, to
the Secretary of State, Washington.

Sir: I have the honor to address your. excellency for the purpose of
bringing to your notice, by means of the copy herewith inclosed, the
invitation which the Government of the Republie that I represent has
the high honor to address to you, for the purposes stated in the note. It
extends this invitation feeling every confidence in the lofty American
spirit and the good will of the United States Government.

I transcribe to your excellency, in full, the note whereby I am in-
structed to bring to the notice of your Government this invitation; it
reads as follows:

** Montevideo, October 29, 1884.
“Mr. CHARGE D’AFFAIRES:

“T send you a printed copy of the law recently passed by the honor-
able general assembly of the Republic providing for the establishment,
in the national library, of a bureau which is to be called ‘The Central
Bureau of International Exchanges of Publications.’

‘In pursuance of the provisions of article 8 of the reglementary de-
cree of that law, you will be pleased to invite the Governient to which
you are accredited, in the name of the Republic, to conclude a conven-
tion for the exchange of publications on various subjects. Two objects
are had in view by the Government in pursuing this course, viz, to
draw still closer the cordial relations which exist between this Republic
and that of the United States of America, and to encourage, by facilitat-
ing them as far as possible, the knowledge and study of literary, scien-
tific, and other questions among the nations of America, whose advances
in progress and civilization must speedily place them on a footing with
the most progressive nations of Europe. Your superior enlightenment
renders it unnecessary for ne to advance any arguments in order to show
theimportance of the proposed convention, or the advantages which must
accrue from if to the nations adopting it. If, as is to be hoped, the
United States Government agrees to conclude the arrangement in ques-
tion, it may be done on the basis of that which already exists between
this Republie and Chili, or of that concluded by Belgium with various
other nations, which you will find in the inclosed printed documents, if
the United States Government does not consider that certain modifica-
tions are necessary, which the Government of this Republic is prepared
to consider. You ll be pleased to request that Government to send
you a reply in regard to this matter.

‘““ MANUEL HERRERA Y OBER.”

In bringing the foregoing note to your knowledge, and inclosing the
printed copy of the conventions to which it refers, permit me to hope
that the cabinet of which your excellency is so distinguished a mem-
ber will not consider the plan which I hereby have the honor to submit

as impracticable, since it will tend torender better known in our country
the practical details of the institutions of this, together with its ad-
vances, which so greatly stimulate our own, while the constant perusal
of the publications of our Republic will show the eagerness with which
American countries of Spanish extraction are seeking, iv spite of well-
known obstacles, to secure for themselves a permanent position among
the nations of the modern world. /

DECREE.

In conformity with the provisions of article 3 of the law of May 27,
1884, the Executive of the Republic decrees:

Article 1. After the office of International Exchanges of Publications
referred to in the preceding law has been established and organized,
the director of the national library will, with the view to the better
service of said office, prepare regulations for the same, which he will
in due time submit to the Government for its approval.

Article 2. The above-mentioned functionary will on the 3lst Decem-
ber of each year present to this ministry a report showing the progress,
the needs, and the increase of said office, which document, when pub-
lished, shall be transmitted to all institutions which exchange publica-
tions with the national library.

Article 3. All the departments and their bureaus will transmit to the
office of International Exchanges of Publications 25 copies of all the
documents published by them.

Article 4. The director of the national library will acquire for the
office to which this decree relates, all such publications as will, in his
opinion, tend to contribute to the reputation of the Republic in foreign
parts, with the view that this office may distribute them. ‘The provis-
ions of this artcle, however, shall not interfere with any donations
which may be made to the office of exchanges.

Article 5. All agents of the Republic in foreign countries will aid the
director of the library, whenever he calls on them for such aid; and
if such obligation involves any expenditure, the agents shall, before
taking any action, inform the director of the amount needed, so that he
may either allow the expenditure or refuse it, according to the amount
of funds at his disposal for the purpose.

Article 6. Any conventions which may be concluded in the future
shall be formulated according to the test of the convention concluded
between the chargé @’ affaires of Uruguay in Chili and the Govern-
ment of Chili on the 6th June, 1873, and whenever this is impossi-
ble, according to the project of a convention prepared at Brussels on
the 26th August, 1850.*

Article 7. In view of the fact that any delay in the conclusion of con-
ventions may prove prejudicial to the Republic and the national li- |
brary, the director of that institution will propose to the Department
of State the establishment of an exchange of publications with all those
nations with whom, in his opinion, such an exchange should be estab-
lished, determining at the same time what publications should be
exchanged. Andif the Department of State approves of the propo-

1883, pp. 123, 124.]

sition, it will transmit it to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which im
mediately, and without any legislation on the subject, will proceed to
arrange the necessary convention, reporting its action to the Depart-
~ment of State.

Article 8. There shall be forwarded to all the Governments of Amer-
ica, through the intermediary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a circular
giving the provisions of the law in question and of this decree, inviting
them at the same time to enjoy the benefits which will result from such
an exchange for all nations which accept it.

Article 9. The above shall be published and inserted in the code of

laws.

Exchange of publications between Uruguay and Chili.

Met at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the sixth day of June, one
thousand eight hundred and seventy-three, Don Jose ©. Arrieta, chargé
Waffaires of the Republic of Uruguay, and Don Adolfo Ibanez, minister
of foreign affairs of Chili, for the purpose of concluding a convention
for the regular and permanent exchange between the two Republics of
the literary and scientific productions of their citizens, which will
strengthen the bonds of sympathy which unite the two countries, and
agreed upon the following articles:

Article 1. The Government of Uruguay and of Chili will send to each
other, as soon as possible, two copies of all the publications which they
have had printed in accordance with the provisions of the law in their
respective territories, excepting productions of purely private interest
or whose contents do not entitle them to be considered as scientific or
literary publications.

Article 2. The same obligation will be in force even if the publica-
tions in question have not been published in either of the two countries,
but have been published at the expense of either of the two Govern-
ments, or by their aid or subvention.

Article 3. As soon as one of the two Governments has received the
publications sent by the other, it will acknowledge their receipt in the
official journal, giving the place where they have been published and
the place whence they were sent, with the view to bring them to the
notice of those who desire to obtain them.

Articie 4. The provisions of the above three articles will apply to geo-
graphical maps and other works of that character.

Article 5. Kach Government will also procure and send to the other
two copies of works published by citizens of their respective countries
residing abroad; but this obligation will cease as regards the Govern-
ment of Uruguay if a citizen of Uruguay publishes a work in Chili, and
as regards the Government of Chili if a Chilian citizen publishes a
work in Uruguay.
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 57

Article 6. Each of the two Governments will form a collection as com-
plete as possible of all the works published within its territory, or out-
side of it, if the provisions of article 2 apply to them; and will trans-
mit this collection to the other at as early a date as possible. This col-
lection should especially comprise works treating of the history, geog-
raphy, industries, statistics, and legislation of the country.

Article 7. Publications shall be transmitted in the month of January
of every year; in Uruguay through the intermediary of the Chilian
legation, and in Chili through the intermediary of the Uruguayan le-
gation, or direct between the two Governments whenever there are no
legations.

Article 8. The present convention will go into effect this day, and
will continue in force, until either of the two Governments shall desire
its discontinuance, and shall so advise the other.

At the close of this conference the chargé d’affaires of Uruguay and
the Chilian minister of foreign relations have signed this document in

‘duplicate copy, and affixed thereto their respective seals.

From the Smithsonian Institution, January 31, 1885, to Hon. F. T. Fre-
linghuysen, Secretary of State.

Str: In acknowledging the receipt of your letter of the 30th of
December last, inclosing a copy of a note from the Chargé d’affaires
of Uruguay in reference to an exchange of publications between that
Government and the Government of the United States, I beg to say
that an answer was necessarily deferred until a translation could be
made of the Spanish document accompanying your communication, the
original of which is herewith returned.

It is not my province to offer suggestions to the Government of Uru-
guay regarding a general system of exchanges with the various Gov-
ernments of the world; but so far as the United States is concerned, I
can say that it will give the Smithsonian Institution much pleasure to
make the necessary arrangements for an interchange of official publica-
tions of the two countries, the Institution sending to Uruguay at least
once a year, and perhaps twice, all the publications of the Government
of the United States, whether printed by order of Congress or any of
the Departments—these, of course, in return for an equally exhaustive
and comprehensive transmission on the part of the Government of Uru-
guay, all the returns received to be placed in the Library of Congress.

The Smithsonian Institution cannot undertake to secure publications
generally of the scientific and literary establishments of the United
States, but it will be happy to do all in its power in this respect. It
is, however, willing to send its own works—the Smithsonian Contribu-
tions to Knowledge, the Miscellaneous Collections, and the Annual
58 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

Reports, which embody a large percentage of American scientific litera-
ture.

In return for this special and separate sending it would expect for
its own library copies of any works on scientific subjects published by
the Government of Uruguay.

In reference to the best, or most convenient, method of conducting
an exchange of publications between the two countries in question, I
beg to say that where distant communication by sea is involved, as is
the case in the present instance, we find it most convenient to deliver
all packages, free of freight, to the consul in New York of the country
addressed, and to have the returns transmitted free of cost to the
American consul at the port of shipment.

This course is pursued for the reason that any question of ocean ex-
penses can be more readily settled on delivery of the packages. Al- -
though differing somewhat from that agreed upon at Brussels, this ar-
rangement has been acceded to by all the European correspondents of
the Smithsonian Institution. Of course it would not be impossible to
make deliveries at Montevideo, if that be the proper port of entry, but
there would necessarily be petty charges that even in that case it would
be difficult to arrange for.

I inclose for the information of the chargé d’affaires of Uruguay
some of the publications of the Smithsonian Institution bearing upon
the subject of exchanges, and which possibly may contain some in-
formation that will interest him.

A first transmission can be made by our sending as complete a series
of the documents of the United States Government as can now be sup-
plied. This will consist of publications for a number of years, and will
include several hundred volumes, occupying 13 cases. And we shall
be pleased to receive information as to the exact address for the con-
signment, both in this country and Uruguay.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SPENCER F. BAIRD.

Prof. Spencer F. Baird, Secretary Smithsonian Institution.

Sir: As suggested by dispatch No. 50 of the 21st ultimo, from Vienna,
I inelose a copy of the same and of the list of official works of the
Austro-Hungarian Government for exchange, to which it refers; and Ll

Sir: I have the honor to report that Mr. George H. Boehmer, chief
of Exchange Bureau for the Smithsonian Institution and the Congres-
sional Library, having special reference to Government publications,
recently visited Vienna with a view of securing such exchange between
. Austria-Hungary, and the Bureau above named, of which he is chief.

In conformity with your general instruction to diplomatic agents of
the United States abroad, of which Mr. Boehmer was the bearer, I as-
sisted him in procuring interviews with representatives of the Austro-
Hungarian Government, who are authorized to treat upon the object of
his mission, for this purpose securing audience on the 9th instant with
Count Szdgyényi, chief of section of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, on
which occasion the subject-matter was fully discussed, and the methods
to be adopted in the proposed exchange freely canvassed.

Count Szogyényi expressed much interest in the matter, and appointed
a meeting for the next day with Mr. Boehmer, to give it further con-
sideration. Mr. Boehmer was subsequently placed in communication
with other departments of the Government to arrange details, and the
result as reported to me by him was in every respect satisfactory. The
publications will now be sent forward regularly from each eapital, the
one to the other, in the exchange of Government publications.

The details of the agreement entered into will be reported by Mr.
Boehmer to the Congressional Librarian.

From Hon. John M. Francis, ambassador, United States legation, Vienna,
October 24, i884, to Hon. Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, Secretary of State,
Washington, D. C. :

Sir: Referring to my No. 17, of the date of October 16th, relative to
the exchange of Government publications between the Government of
the United States and that of Austria-Hungary, I have the honor to
inclose herewith copy of note on this subject to Count Szégyényi, chief
of section of Ministry of Foreign Affairs, of the date of October 9, with
copy of inclosure therein, a letter of same date addressed to me by Mr.
George H. Boehmer, chief of Exchange Bureau of the Smithsonian In-

thus far made in the matter.
60 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

From Hon. John M. Francis, ambassador, United States legation, Vienna,
October 9, 1884, to his excellency the Count Szégyényt, chief of section
of Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

Your EXCELLENCY: I have the honor to inclose herewith a copy of a
communication this day received by me from Mr. George H. Boehmer,
delegate of the Library of Congress of the United States, treating of
the subject of a proposed exchange of official documents between the
Government of the United States and Austria-Hungary.

I beg leave to inform your excellency that I have received instruc-
tions from my Government to aid as far as may be convenient in draw-
ing the attention of His Imperial Majesty’s Government to the subject
matter referred to, with the hope that the exchange of Government
publications as proposed may be favorably regarded by His Majesty’s
Government to the end that the desired object be assured.

I avail myself of this occasion to renew to your excellency the as-
surance of my distinguished consideration.

From George H. Boehmer, Vienna, Austria, October 9, 1884, to his ex-
cellency Mr. John M. Francis, envoy extraordinary and minister pleni-
potentiary of the United States of America, Vienna.

Sir: In the year 1867, the Congress of the United States passed a
law authorizing the exchange, under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution, of a certain number of all the United States official docu-
ments for the corresponding publications of other Governments through-
out the world, the returns to be placed in the National (Congressional)
Library.

The object of this law was to procure for the use of the Congress of
the United States a complete series of the publications of other Gov-
ernments.

A circular letter was therefore issued by the Smithsonian Institution,
asking the advice of the various Governments as to the best method of
accomplishing the object.

It was important to ascertain what Governments were willing to
enter into the proposed exchange, and whether any one person or branch
of the Government or public library in each country would undertake
to collect ail the national publications and transmit them to Washing-
ton. Information was-also desired as to the titles and character of the
regular official publications of each country, and their average number
and extent in each year, as well as the names of the different sources
from which they emanate.

On the 30th of October, 1875, a citcular was sent by Professor Henry,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, with a letter to the foreign
ministers at Washington,* and among them to the ambassador of His
Majesty the Emperor of Austria.

*[This circular and letter were published in the Smithsonian Report for 1881, pp.
768, 769.)
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 64

In accordance with instructions received in respect to the letter re-
ferred to, the first two boxes of documents were sent to Vienna, and are
now deposited in the Imperial Royal Library. Subsequent transmis-
sions, however, were refused by the imperial legation at Washington
as being too bulky.

It is now desired by the Congress of the United States of America
to resume relations of exchanges with the Empire of Austria, this
being the only Government required to complete the exchange serv-
ice with the United States of all the European monarchies, and in this
connection I beg to remark that the Smithsonian Institution, as the
authorized agent of the Government, has now ready for transmission,
(in addition to the boxes of documents already received into the Impe-
rial Royal Library), eighteen (18) boxes, each of about six cubic feet,
containing several thousand volumes, and to which about two boxes
will be added each year. This entire accumulation would, upon ac-
ceptance of the terms:and conditions of the exchange on the part of
His Imperial Majesty’s Government, be delivered at once and free of
cost to any agent the Imperial Government might be pleased to appoint
at any seaport of the United States, while the returns on the part of
His Imperial Majesty’s Government should be placed, free of cost, in
the hands of Dr. Felix Fliigel, 49 Sidonien Strasse, Leipsic, the agent
of the Smithsonian Institution for Europe. The boxes or parcels thus
sent should be marked, ‘‘ To the Smithsonian Institution, for the Library
of Congress,” and both these establishments be informed of the sending
by letter, together with a list of the documents sent.

In obedience to instructions I have the honor to submit this proposal
of exchange to you, and to request your excellency to lay the same
before the proper authorities of His Imperial Majesty’s Government
and to kindly advise me of any aetion taken or any results derived
from this application.

From his excellency the Count Szdgyényi, chief of section of Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, to Hon. John M. Francis, ambassador, Vienna, Octo-
ber 20, 1884.

Sir: In conformity with the desire expressed in the esteemed note
of the 9th instant, I’. O. No. 8, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has made
known to the respective imperial and royal central stations the mis-
sion of Mr. Boehmer, chief of Congressional Bureau of the United
States for International Exchange, who proposed making an agreement
whereby a regular exchange of official publications may be established
between the Governments of Austria-Hungary and the United States.

The Jmperial Royal Ministry of the Interior has already expressed its
approval of such an agreement as far as its department is concerned,
and observes in this connection that it deems it most advisable to con-
fine itself to the regular communication of the reports of the sessions of
the Austrian Parliament and of the official paper known as the Legal
62 REPORT ON EXCHANGES.

Advertiser (Reichs Gesetzblatt), which publishes all the general laws
enacted, believing that reports of the sessions of the several provincial
diets and the different provincial laws and regulations would be of but
a secondary interest to the United States Government.

The undersigned will not fail to communicate to the Hon. J. M. Fran-
cis, envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of the United
States of America, all further information bearing upon this question,
and avails himself of this opportunity to tender a renewed assurance of
his high esteem.

From Hon. John M. Francis, ambassador, United States legation, Vienna,
January 21, 1885, to Hon. Frederick T. Frelinghuysen, Secretary of
State, Washington, D. C.

Sir: [ have the honor to inclose herewith translation of a note from
Baron Pasetti, chief of section Ministry of Foreign Affairs, dated Janu-
ary 16, 1885, in regard to the exchange of Government publications be-
tween the Government of the United States and that of Austria, as fully
set forth in my No. 20 of October 24, 1884.

Baron Paseitti’s note, with accompanying inclosure of a list of official
works from the imperial royal department of public instruction, ex-
plains or suggests the basis of the proposed international exchange,
which has the approval of Mr. Boehmer, agent for the Congressional
Library and Smithsonian Institution, whe recently conferred with the
proper Government officials here on this subject.

Mr. Boehmer now requests that a copy of the inclosed communication
from Baron Pasetti and the accompanying list of official works referred
to be transmitted by the department to the directors of the Smithsonian
Institution. : ;

From Baron Pasetti, minister of foreign affairs, Vienna, January 16,
1885, to Hon. John M. Francis envoy extraordinary and minister pleni-
potentiary of the United States.

Str: On the 20th of October last, under Nos. £422, the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs had the honor of informing Hon. John M. Francis, en-
voy extraordinary’'and minister plenipotentiary of the United States
of America, that the Imperial Royal Ministry of the Interior had con-
sented to an establishment of a regular exchange of official publica-
tions with the United States Government.

In the mean time a note has been received by the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs from the Imperial Royal Ministry of Instruction, wherein the
latter makes known its views on the above question.

The last named ministry says that the exchange of official publica-
tions and of periodicals published by scientific institutes in Austria has
been uniformly pursued for some time. Numerous copies are forwarded
REPORT ON EXCHANGES. 63

annually in every direction, and the volumes sent in return by institutes
abroad are promptly and regularly received. This direct mode of ex-
change between the respective corporations, institutes, &c., facilitates
not only the requirements in the most speedy and simple manner, but
tends also to reduce the expenses of transmission to the lowest possible
rate. The Imperial Royal Ministryof Instruction would nevertheless be
ready to accept the proposal made by the American Government as far °
as its department is concerned on condition that the exchange be not
extended to all publications made, but be confined to such as would
upon investigation be found to be the most acceptable and needed by
both parties, and that the number of copies to be sent would also be
made dependent upon this rule. With this view the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs begs to inclose herewith to the North American envoy a list
compiled by the Ministry of Instruction, giving the publications periodi-
cally appearing under its direction, and requests that it be transmitted,
and that the number and the titles of the copies desired on the part of
America be pointed out.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs addresses itself at the same time to
the other departments interested in the exchange in question, request-
ing them to make known their views on the subject, and to send in simi-
lar lists of periodicals published under their direction.

As far as the publications are concerned which have been offered by
America, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs will first inform the different
departments of the receipt of the work published by Mr. Boehmer, en-
titled “ History of the Smithsonian Exchanges,” of which the author
had the kindness of placing several copies at the disposal of the Imperial
Royal Government, in connection with which it must be observed that
the list of official American publications the work contains only reaches
as far back as the year 1881, which will probably make a supplement
necessary.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs begs to observe here that the Ministry
of Instruction regards it as a matter of course that this proposed new
arrangement will in no way affect or alter the exchange of publications
kept up for a number of years heretofore with the Smithsonian Institu-
tion.

Finally, the ministry wishes to say that in case an agreement is made
the publications intended for Austria be forwarded by the American
Government to Vienna, carriage paid, and that the Austrian consign-
meuts be sent, carriage paid, to be delivered either at Leipsic or at
Washington, according to the desire of the American Government.

While the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has the honor of conveying
this intelligence to the knowledge of the honorable North American
envoy, the undersigned embraces the opportunity to renew the assur-
ance of his profound consideration.

LIST OF FOREIGN CORRESPONDENTS.

By GEORGE H. BOEHMER.

One of the instructions furnished on occasion of an official visit
to Europe, in July, 1884, on business connected with the exchange
of official public documents of the United States with foreign Gov-
ernments, provided for the collecting of accurate and sufficient data
to be employed in correcting the “List of Foreign Correspondents of
the Smithsonian Institution” in use by the exchange service of that
establishment; and, as a result of the attention given by the compiler
to the instructions received, a new list, corrected and revised to the 1st
of July, 1885, is herewith presented.

The present list has been made as perfect and correct as has been
possible with the assistance of the agents of exchange in the various
countries visited. Among the gentlemen who have extended aid and
