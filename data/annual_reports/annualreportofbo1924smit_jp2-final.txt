REPORT

OF THE

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
Cuar_tes D. WaLcoTT

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1924

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith the customary
annual report showing the activities and conditions of the Smith-
sonian Institution and its branches during the fiscal year ending
June 380, 1924. The first 26 pages of the report contain an ac-
count of the affairs of the Institution proper, with brief abstracts
of the work carried on by the various branches of the Institution,
while appendixes 1 to 10 present somewhat more detailed summaries
of the operations of the United States National Museum, the Na-
tional Gallery of Art, the Freer Gallery of Art, the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology, the International Exchanges, the National Zoologi-
cal Park, the Astrophysical Observatory, the United States Regional
Bureau of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, the
Smithsonian Library, and of the publications of the Institution and
its branches. :

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting
the trust Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and therefore
constituted an “ establishment ” whose statutory members are “ the
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of

the executive departments.”
I
2 _ ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924 8

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The affairs of the Institution are administered by a Board of
Regents whose membership consists of “the Vice President, the
Chief Justice, three Members of the Senate, and three Members of
the House of Representatives, together with six other persons
other than Members of Congress, two of whom shall be resident in
the City of Washington and the other four shall be inhabitants of
some State, but no two of them of the same State.” One of the
Regents is elected chancellor by the board; in the past the selection
has fallen upon the Vice President or the Chief Justice; and a suit-
able person is chosen by them as secretary of the Institution, who
is also secretary of the Board of Regents and the executive officer
directly in charge of the Institution’s activities.

In regard to the personnel of the board, the following changes
occurred during the year: Through his succession to the Presidency
on August 2, 1923, owing to the death of President Harding, the
Hon. Calvin Coolidge automatically ceased to be a Regent, thus
terminating his office as chancellor of the Institution, and to fill
the vacancy thus created, the Hon. William H. Taft was elected
chancellor of the board on December 13, 1923. Walter H. Newton,
Member of the House of Representatives from Minnesota, was ap-
pointed a Regent by the Speaker of the House to fill the vacancy
caused by the election to the Senate of Frank L. Greene.

The roll of Regents at the close of the fiscal year was as follows:
William H. Taft, Chief Justice of the United States, chancellor;
Henry Cabot Lodge, Member of the Senate; Medill McCormick,
Member of the Senate; A. Owsley Stanley, Member of the Senate;
Albert Johnson, Member of the House of Representatives; R. Wal-
ton Moore, Member of the House of Representatives; Walter H.
Newton, Member of the House of Representatives; George Gray,
citizen of Delaware; Charles F. Choate, jr., citizen of Massachu-
setts; Henry White, citizen of Washington, D. C.; Robert S. Brook-
ings, citizen of Missouri; Irwin B. Laughlin, citizen of Pennsyl-
vania; and Frederic A. Delano, citizen of Washington, D. C.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

In spite of the increasing difficulty in holding its own experienced
by the Institution in late years on account of its meager resources
and the increasing costs of maintenance, one of its primary functions,
the “diffusion of knowledge among men,” is carried out with ever-
increasing scope, and its contacts with various groups of people are
continually growing in number. Of its 11 distinct series of publi-
cations, chiefly technical contributions to scientific knowledge though
including some more popular papers appealing to the general reader

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY o

interested in the progress of science, there are issued every year about
100 volumes and pamphlets, of which there are sent out nearly
150,000 copies. A large proportion of this number go to libraries
throughout the world, where they are readily available to the public,
and many of its publications are now standard works in various
branches of science. Besides this steady flow of publications, the
Institution, through the public exhibits of the National Museum,
the National Gallery of Art, and the National Zoological Park,
imparts an incalculable amount of knowledge on natural history,
anthropology, art, and history to the hundreds of thousands of visi-
tors from all parts of the country who come to the Nation’s Capital
every year. In late years also the value of the arts and industries
department of the Museum is becoming more and more appreciated
by the public and by industrial organizations, and the exhibits por-
traying the scope of entire industries are being augmented at an
increasing rate by the cooperation of trade associations who assemble
these comprehensive exhibits from a number of manufacturers. The
auditorium of the National Museum is used every year by a large
number of local and national scientific and other societies for the
dissemination of useful knowledge through conferences and lectures,
and the scientific staffs of the Museum, the Bureau of American
Ethnology, and other branches of the Institution contribute their
share in the program of the diffusion of knowledge through scientific
and semipopular lectures, both officially and unofficially. The archeo-
logical excavations conducted in Florida during the past winter by
the Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology were known
throughout Florida as the “ Smithsonian excavations” and attracted
thousands of visitors, to whom Doctor Fewkes lectured several times
each week on the prehistoric Indian inhabitants of the region. The
latest addition to the Institution’s program in the diffusion of know]l-
edge was the inauguration during the year of a series of radio talks
on scientific subjects presented in popular form, and the response to
these was so widespread that the series will be continued with in-
creased scope during the coming year. This program of dissemina-
tion of knowledge in scientific matters is carried on, as stated at the
beginning, with the greatest difficulty because of the very limited
endowment of the Institution, and were more means at its disposal,
the Institution would be enabled to greatly expand its work along
these lines, as well as in its other fundamental purpose, the increase
of knowledge through scientific research and exploration.

Perhaps the most important development of the year in the In-
stitution’s affairs is the promising outlook for a building to house
the growing National Gallery of Art. As noted in last year’s re-
port, Congress has provided a site in the Smithsonian Park for such
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

a building and funds were obtained privately for the preparation
of plans. Mr. Charles A. Platt was selected as the architect and at
the close of the year the plans were well under way. In addition
to this, Senator Lodge during the year offered an amendment to
the deficiency appropriations bill which would have provided funds
for beginning the erection of a building, but the amendment was
not accepted. However, these developments indicate an awakening
to the realization that America should no longer be practically the
only civilized nation on earth without a National Art Gallery, and
it is hoped that in the near future funds will be provided for a
suitable home for the valuable art collections belonging to the
Nation.

Dr. William L. Abbott has continued his contributions during the

year for researches in natural history and collection of specimens in
China.

Further generous contributions have been made by Mr. John A.
Roebling for researches in astrophysics, providing for aiding the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 5

solar observing stations in Chile and the United States, for publica-
tion of scientific papers, for purchase of instruments, and for making
meteorological investigations elsewhere.

Mr. Washington A. Roebling has made a generous donation for the
purchase of minerals.

The National Academy of Sciences has given the sum of $1,500
for researches in paleontology.

The Institution is also indebted to the Research Corporation for
$1,250 for research work.

Freer Gallery of Art—In compliance with the instructions of the
Board of Regents, a sinking fund for the investment of surplus in-
come from the Freer bequest has been created. The amount paid
into this fund during the year was $138,688.75. The invested funds
of the Freer bequest are classified as follows:

The practice of depositing on time, in local trust companies and
banks, such revenues as may be spared temporarily has been con-
tinued during the pasti year, and interest on these deposits has
amounted to $1,014.59. The income during the year for current ex-
penses, consisting of interest on permanent investments and other
miscellaneous sources, including cash balance at the beginning of the
year, amounted to $72,558.59. Revenues and principal of funds for
specific purposes, except the Freer bequest, amounted to $91,919.99.
Revenues on account of Freer bequest amounted to $234,446.50. Cash
recalled from the time deposits, $34,000; aggregating a total of
$432,925.08.

The disbursements, described more fully in the annual report of
the executive committee, were classed as follows: General objects of
the Institution, $64,960.03; for specific purposes (except the Freer
bequest), $58,501.72; temporary advances for field expenses, etc., in
excess of repayments, $4,130.12; expenditures pertaining to the
Charles L. Freer bequest, $291,768.05; and cash balance on hand
June 30, 1924, $13,565.16.

The following appropriations were intrusted by Congress to the
care of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year 1924:

RESEARCHES AND PXPLORATIONS

Every year the Institution engages, so far as its limited means
will permit, in explorations and field work, and a few of these ex-
peditions will be mentioned here briefly to indicate the nature of the
work accomplished. A number of other expeditions and researches
in various fields of science are described in the appendixes on the
National Museum, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Astro-
physical Observatory, and the Freer Gallery of Art. Ina few cases,
the entire expedition is financed and managed by the Institution,
but the small amount of income remaining each year, after the ad-
ministrative costs of carrying on the work of the Institution are met,
is soon exhausted, and thereafter it is only possible to cooperate in
various ways in expeditions financed by other scientific institutions.

GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS IN THE CANADIAN ROCKIES

During the summer and early fall of 1923, your Secretary con-
tinued his geological field work in the Canadian Rockies of Al-
berta and British Columbia. His main objective was to secure data
on the pre-Devonian strata from the Clearwater River southeast to
the Bow Valley and along the eastern side of the Columbia River
Valley.

It was found that the Mons formation which was discovered on
the headwaters of the Saskatchewan River at Glacier Lake, extended
southwesterly on the western side of the Continental Divide in Brit-
ish Columbia to the southern end of the Stanford Range between
the Kootenay River and Columbia Lake, which is at the head of
the Great Columbia River, which here flows northwesterly in what
is known as the Rocky Mountain Trench. The valley of this latter
river was found to be largely underlain by the limestones and shales
of the Mons formation of the Ozarkian system, and the strata have
been upturned, faulted, and folded prior to the great pre-Glacial

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 7

period of erosion that cut out the Rocky Mountain Trench. On the
eastern side of this valley, the Mons formation is more than 3,800
feet in thickness in the Beaverfoot-Brisco-Stanford Range, and con-
tains four well-developed fossil faunas which show it to lie between
the Upper Cambrian and the Ordovician systems of this and other
parts of the continent. Near the head of the Sinclair Canyon there
was discovered a great development of the Lower Ordovician, and
at several localities cliffs of massive Upper Cambrian limestones
were recognized beneath the Mons formation.

This whole region is ideal for geological field work, as the numer-
ous canyons and ridges expose many of the formations from base to
summit. On the whole, the season was a successful one for its geo-
logical results.

EXPEDITION TO DINOSAUR NATIONAL MONUMENT, UTAH

In May, 1923, Mr. C. W. Gilmore, curator of vertebrate paleon-
tology, National Museum, was detailed to take charge of an expedi-
tion to the Dinosaur National Monument in northeastern Utah for
the purpose of securing for exhibition in the Museum a mountable
skeleton of the large sauropodous dinosaur, Diplodocus. 'The fossil
deposit in this region was discovered in 1909 by Mr. Earl Douglass,
and has been worked continuously since that time by the Carnegie
Museum of Pittsburgh. By 1922, the Carnegie Museum had secured
sufficient material for their purposes, and the Institution was notified
of their intention to cease operations, leaving uncovered two partially
articulated specimens of Diplodocus, a mountable skeleton of which
has long been desired by the National Museum. Mr. Gilmore ar-
rived at the fossil quarry on May 15, and a preliminary survey showed
that one of the two skeletons would form the basis of a mountable
specimen while the preserved parts of the other would serve ad-
mirably to replace the missing bones of the first. Regular work in
the quarry began on May 24 and continued until August 8. “Mr.
Gilmore employed three men with experience in this field, and was
assisted after June 5 by Mr. Norman H. Boss, of the Museum’s
paleontological force. Regarding the difficulties involved, Mr. Gil-
more says: ;

The work of quarrying these often fragile bones from the ledge of rock
without doing irreparable damage is a slow and tedious operation, involving
the skill of both the stone cutter and the miner. Further difficulty is encountered
in handling by primitive methods the immense blocks of rock inclosing the
bones, with the subsequent arduous work of boxing and transportation. The
largest block quarried, containing the sacrum with attached hip bones, weighed
nearly 6,000 pounds when ready for shipment. The transportation of the boxes
to the railroad involved a haul by teams of 150 miles across country and over
a range of mountains 9,100 feet above sea level. However, 34 large boxes hav-
ing a combined weight of over 25 tons were safely transported.
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

As a result of this expedition, enough material was secured for a
good skeletal mount of Diplodocus which, it is estimated, will exceed
80 feet in length with a height at the hips of 14 feet.

BIOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS IN THE YANG-TZE VALLEY, CHINA

Through the continued generosity of Dr. W. L. Abbott, Mr. Charles
M. Hoy sailed for China toward the close of 1922 to collect verte-
brates for the Institution in the Yang-Tze Valley region. His first
collecting was done in the Yochow district, where he obtained a total
of 169 mammals and 84 birds. At the beginning of the fiscal year
just past, Hoy left for a trip through Hunan and Kiangsi, in the
course of which many interesting specimens were obtained. From
Kuling, Kiangsi, a letter was received from Hoy, describing a series
of misfortunes, as follows:

The day after writing my last letter to you, from Iningchow [never received],
I had a bad fall and badly wrenched my back. For about a week I was
searcely able to crawl about. Just when my back was getting so I could
straighten up I had another accident and shot myself through the left leg with
the Colt 45 automatic. The accident was due to a “hang fire.’ The gun did
not go off when the hammer struck and so I lowered the gun to eject the
shell when the shell exploded. The bullet struck me on the inside of the leg
4 inches above the ankle bone. * * * The wound is healing nicely, but the
doctor says that it may be several months before I get full use of my foot and
that I will most likely have a slight permanent limp. However, I am hoping
that it won’t interfere with my collecting, but even if I won’t be able to do
much walking myself I have one man who is a crack shot with the shotgun
and another that is fair with the rifle, so I ought to be able.to get specimens
anyhow. My trip down from Iningchow was rather uneventful except for the
above accidents. We were under military guard all the way from there to
Kuikiang. The country, it seems, is full of disbanded Northern soldiers who
have driven out the natives and occupied their farms. Consequently it is
dangerous for even natives to travel through that region. The final explana-
tion given me, as to the reason of the escort, was that it was feared that my
guns and ammunition might fall into their hands. We were fired on once, in
the night, but aside from a lot of shouting and that one shot, nothing hap-
pened. We could never learn who fired the shot, but the way things turned out
I am convinced that we were mistaken for bandits and the shot was fired to
scare us off. Owing to the accidents, I have not been able to secure any speci-
mens since the writing of my last letter. My outfit has not yet arrived owing
to the heavy rains, but as soon as it gets here I plan to send my men out collect-
ing so I will be able to get specimens notwithstanding the fact that I am con-
fined to the house.

The gunshot wound was apparently healing, but while Hoy was
still confined to the house he developed a severe case of appendicitis,
necessitating an immediate operation, from which he never recovered.

BOTANICAL EXPLORATION IN PANAMA AND CENTRAL AMERICA

Dr. William R. Maxon, associate curator of plants in the National
Museum, was detailed in May, 1923, to accompany an expedition

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9

from the Department of Agriculture to Panama and Central
America. Unfortunately rains interfered seriously with field work
in both Panama and Nicaragua, but in spite of this handicap, a gen-
eral botanical collection of about 4,500 specimens was made, about
equally divided among Panama, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. In
his report on the expedition, Doctor Maxon says:

Aside from two days given to collecting in the interesting Juan Diaz region,
east of Panama City, work in Panama was mostly confined to the Canal Zone,
being conducted chiefly from headquarters on the Pacific side, at Balboa, with
the courteous assistance of the Panama Canal authorities. Of particular in-
terest were trips to Barro Colorado, a large wooded island in Gatun Lake
opposite Frijoles, recently set aside as a wild reserve upon representation of
the Institute for Research in Tropical America; the virgin forest region at the
headwaters of the Rio Chinilla, above Monte Lirio; and the Fort Sherman
Military Reservation, which includes the famous old Spanish stronghold, Fort
San Lorenzo, at the mouth of the Chagres. All these localities are forested
and are rich in palms, and special attention was directed to obtaining material
in this difficult group. With the steady clearing of leased land for planting
bananas the original forest in the Canal Zone is rapidly disappearing, and with
it its characteristic palm associations. * * *

About three weeks were spent in Nicaragua, wholly in the region west of Lake
- Nicaragua and mainly working from Managua, the capital, which lies pic-
turesquely at a new elevation 90 miles inland from the Pacific coast, flanked
by numerous voleanoes. Except for the volcanoes and the low range called the
Sierra, given over to coffee production, western Nicaragua is low and almost
entirely cleared of forest. Cane and grazing are the main industries. The
soil is largely a rich black loam of volcanic origin, and supports a luxuriant
growth of tall grasses, the arborescent vegetation being mainly confined to
roadsides and abandoned “ potrero.” The most interesting trips were to the
region of Casa Colorado in the Sierra, and to Mombacho and Santiago vol-
canoes. The material collected indicates a rich flora for the higher mountain
slopes, one that would amply repay extended exploration.

From Corinto Doctor Maxon proceeded by steamer to Puntarenas, the Pa-
cific port of Costa Rica. The ascent by rail from this port in the semiarid
coastal plain to the capital, San José, lying at .an altitude of 1,140 meters in
the cool meseta central, is through a region remarkably diverse as to physiog-
raphy. From San José three principal trips were made: First, to La Palma,
a classical botanical locality on the cloud-drenched southwestern slopes of
IrazG voleano; next to Santa Clara in the mountains a few leagues south of
Cartago; then to Vara Blanca lying high up in an almost unexplored region
between the voleanoes Pofis and Barba. Special attention was here given to
ferns and orchids, both groups being extremely abundant both as to species
and individuals, and many new and interesting species in these and other
groups were collected.

STUDIES ON EARLY MAN IN EUROPE

During the summer and early fall of 1923, Dr. AleS Hrdlicka,
curator of physical anthropology, National Museum, revisited the
important sites of early man in western and central Europe, as well
as the institutions in which are preserved the skeletal remains of
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

ancient man and the fossil European apes. During the trip Doctor
Hrdlitka acted as director of the American School in France for
Prehistoric Studies, and was accompanied by a number of American
graduate students. One of the principal objects of the trip was to
secure accurate measurements of the teeth, particularly the lower
molars, of the larger fossil apes and early man by one observer, by
a strictly defined method, and with accurate instruments. Another
object was to take photographs of the various sites of early man of
which good photographs were not available.

The trip included visits to various regions in England, Holland,
Belgium, France, Germany, Bohemia, Austria, and Croatia. In
these countries practically all of the important sites were visited
and as far as possible the skeletal remains of early man and the
fossil apes in museums along the route were examined and measured.
In many cases assistance was given by prominent anthropologists
connected with these institutions in giving first-hand reviews of the
knowledge concerning the specimens and sites, and sometimes in per-
sonal: conduct to the sites themselves. In Holland Doctor Hrdliéka
had the unique privilege of visiting Prof. Eugene Dubois, of Haar-
lem, and seeing the famous remains of the Pithecanthropus as well
as the other Java remains in his possession. Regarding the Pithe-
canthropus remains, Doctor Hrdlicka says:

The remains of, or those attributed to, the Pithecanthropus consist of the
now thoroughly cleansed skull-cap, a femur and three teeth, two molars and
one premolar. Besides these there is from another locality a piece of a strange
primitive lower jaw, and also two skulls with many parts of the skeletons of
a later, though yet rather primitive, type of man from consolidated calcareous
deposits in still another part of the island.

The examination of the originals belonging to the Pithecanthropus find was
in many respects a revelation. It was seen that none of the casts now in
various institutions are accurate, and that the same is true of the so far
published illustrations, above all those of the teeth and femur. The originals
are even more important than held hitherto. The new brain cast shows an
organ very close to human. The femur is without question human. When the
detailed study of all these specimens is published, which Doctor Dubois expects
to occur before the end of the winter, the specimens, though all controversial
points may not be settled, will assume even a weightier place in science than
they have had up to the present.

The trip resulted in an overwhelming sense of the greatness and scientific
importance of the field of early man in western and central Europe and in a

keen appreciation of the opportunities for cooperation in this field by American
students.

SMITHSONIAN SERIES OF RADIO TALKS
Beginning on October 19, 1923, arrangements were made with

radio station WRC, of the Radio Corporation of America, to broad-
cast a series of talks on the Institution and its branches. These

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 1l

were continued until November 16, with such success that in the
spring the conclusion was reached that there would be mutual ad-
vantage to the Institution and to station WRC in giving a series
of talks on scientific subjects. Accordingly there was established a
regular Smithsonian period every Wednesday at 6.15 p. m., and the
series was opened on April 9 by a talk on “ The giants of the animal
world,” by Mr. Austin H. Clark. This was followed by 10 others,
the last one being given on June 18, when the program was discon-
tinued for the summer months.

This new means of carrying out the Institution’s function of the
diffusion of knowledge appears to be highly effective, as indicated
by the number of responses to the talks received at the Institution
and at the broadcasting station. The direction of the entire pro-
gram was placed under Mr. Austin H. Clark, of the National Mu-
seum, who secured the cooperation not only of the members of the
staff of the Institution and its branches but also of the Carnegie
Institution of Washington and of the various scientific bureaus of
the Government whose work is complementary to that of the Insti-
tution. Altogether there were given during the year 18 talks in the
Smithsonian series, as follows:

The Smithsonian Institution, by Austin H. Clark.

The Work of the Smithsonian Observatory, by C. G. Abbot.

The Bureau of Ethnology: What It Is and What It Does, by J. Walter
Fewkes.

Department of Arts and Industries of the United States National Museum,
by Carl W. Mitman.

The Historical Collections of the Smithsonian Institution, United States
National Museum, by Theodore T. Belote.

The National Gallery of Art, by W. H. Holmes.

The National Herbarium, by F. V. Coville.

The Giants of the Animal World, by Austin H. Clark.

Little Folks in Greenland, by Elisabeth Deichmann.

The National Zoological Park, under the direction of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, by N. Hollister.

Useful Plants from America, by F. L. Lewton.

Shooting Stars and What They Are, by George P. Merrill.

Animal Terrors of Past Ages—Dinosaurs, by Charles W. Gilmore.

Surveying the Ocean with the Non-Magnetic Yacht Carnegie, by J. P. Ault,
of the Carnegie Institution.

Program of native Indian music arranged by Miss Frances Densmore.

Large Game Animals of North America, by E. W. Nelson, Chief of the Bureau
_ of Biological Survey.
Flying Animals, by Austin H. Clark.
Atmospheric Electricity, by D. J. Mauchly, of the Carnegie Institution.

The interest shown in these informative radio talks on scientific
matters and the vast audience which it is possible to reach through
the microphone make it apparent that this is destined to become a
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

most important phase of the Institution’s work in diffusing knowl-
edge, and it is intended to renew the series with increased scope in
the fall.

ASSISTANCE TO JAPANESE LIBRARIES DESTROYED DURING THE
RECENT EARTHQUAKE

The recent disastrous earthquake in Japan destroyed large collec-
tions of books in many of the Japanese libraries, including the entire
collection of 700,000 volumes in the library of the Imperial Univer-
sity of Tokyo. During the year an appeal was received in this
country from the Japanese Association of the League of Nations for
books to replenish these unfortunate libraries, especially those of
universities and colleges. The Institution made up as nearly as pos-
sible complete sets of its own publications and forwarded them to a
number of the Japanese libraries, the volumes and pamphlets thus
sent totaling several hundred. In addition, the International Ex-
change Service of the Institution served as a central forwarding
agency for the other American institutions desiring to contribute
their publications, and during the year several large consignments
containing many thousands of publications were transmitted to
Japan.

COOPERATION WITH ORGANIZATIONS MEETING IN WASHINGTON

There has been during the year an unusually large number of
meetings in Washington of scientific or other organizations whose
work has been in some way related to that of the Smithsonian. In
providing an auditorium in the Museum for these meetings, and
through the assistance given in various ways by the scientific and
administrative staff, the Institution has been able to render a real
service in promoting scientific work and discussion. To illustrate
the appreciation of this service by organizations taking advantage
of these facilities, there may be mentioned three important meetings
held during the year. The American Association of Museums held
its nineteenth annual meeting in Washington “May 10-13, most of
the sessions being held at the National Museum. After the meeting
the secretary of the association wrote to the Institution in part as
follows:

The success of the nineteenth annual meeting of the American Association
of Museums was due in considerable part to the hospitality of the Smithsonian
Institution and the friendly help of many individuals on its staff.

At the close of the first National Conference on Outdoor Recrea-
tion, held in Washington in June, the following resolutions were
passed :

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY £3

Whereas the success of this first National Conference on Outdoor Recreation
is due in large measure to the very fine services and facilities made available
by the officers of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum, who
have been untiring in their efforts to promote the comfort and convenience
of the delegates to the conference: Therefore be it

Resolved, That the conference hereby expresses its sincere appreciation of
the spirit of cordial hospitality displayed by the officers and employees of these
great scientific and educational agencies and requests its executive chairman to
so advise Dr. Charles D. Walcott, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
and his official associates.

The annual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences, which
has for many years been held in the National Museum, was held this
year for the first time in the academy’s new building. The follow-
ing resolution passed during the sessions expresses appreciation of
the services which the Institution has been able to render to the
academy in the past:

Resolved, That on the occasion of the removal of its offices from the Smith-
sonian Institution to its new building, the National Academy of Sciences
gratefully expresses its obligations to the Secretary and the Board of Regents
of the Smithsonian Institution for the courtesies extended for over half a
century through the housing and care of the academy records and library,
through its cooperation in the conduct of academy business, and through its
effective aid in promoting the objects of the academy ;

And that the academy expressly acknowledges its high esteem and thanks
to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Charles Doolittle Walcott,
for his personal interest in the welfare of the academy, his unfailing interest
in and attention to the work of the academy in the advancement of science,
and his distinguished services as treasurer, vice president, acting president,
president, and member of the council and committees, both official and un-
official, in its behalf.

PUBLICATIONS

There were issued during the year by the Institution and its
branches a total of 70 volumes and pamphlets, of which 142,385
copies were distributed, including 407 volumes and separates of the
Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, 25,987 volumes and sepa-
rates of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, 19,085 volumes
and separates of the Smithsonian Annual Reports, 3,748 Smithsonian
special publications, 78,734 volumes and separates of the various
series of the National Museum publications, 13,974 publications of
the Bureau of American Ethnology, 78 publications of the National
Gallery of Art, 65 volumes of the Annals of the Astrophysical Ob-
servatory, 35 reports on the Harriman Alaska Expedition, and
1,275 reports of the American Historical Association.

The publications of the Institution, now issued in 11 distinct
series, are its principal means of carrying out a part of its stated
purpose, “the diffusion of knowledge.” There is a widespread and
growing demand for its publications, not only from specialists for
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

the more technical series, but also from the general public, among
whom the importance of scientific matters is coming to be more
and more realized. This popular demand is chiefly for the Smith-
sonian Annual Reports, which contain a general appendix consisting
of series of specially selected articles presenting in readable form
progress and interesting developments in all branches of science.
Unfortunately, owing to the rush of work at the Government Print-
ing Office both during the war and since, these volumes have fallen
behind date, until now they are issued over two years late. How-
ever, for the coming fiscal year, Congress has allotted an additional
amount to enable the Institution to catch up with these reports by
issuing two in one year, and it is hoped that within a year or two
they will again appear more nearly on time. ;

The various publications of the National Museum and of the
Bureau of American Ethnology are given in detail in the report on
publications appended hereto.

In the series of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections 13 papers
were issued during the year, among which may be mentioned two
papers by your secretary on the results of his geological field work
in the Canadian Rockies; an illustrated pamphlet on the History of
Electric Light, by Henry Schroeder, of the General Electric Co.;
a paper on the Telescoping of the Cetacean Skull, by Gerrit S.
Miller, jr., of the National Museum; and a second paper by Dr.
J. Walter Fewkes describing and figuring the beautiful designs on
prehistoric Indian pottery from the Mimbres Valley, N. Mex.

Allotments for printing—The congressional allotments for the
printing of the Smithsonian reports and the various publications of
the branches of the Institution were practically used up at the close
of the year. The appropriation for the Institution and its branches

for the coming year ending June 30, 1925, totals $90,000, allotted as
follows:

Committee on printing and publication—The Smithsonian ad-
visory committee on printing and publication considers all manu-
scripts offered for publication by the Institution and its branches
and makes recommendations thereon to your secretary. It also
considers matters of publication policy and means of effecting econ-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

omies in the Institution’s printing and binding. During the year
nine meetings were held and 100 manuscripts acted upon. The
membership of the committee is as follows: Dr. Leonhard Stejneger,
head curator of biology, National Museum, chairman; Dr. George P.
Merrill, head curator of geology, National Museum; Dr. J. Walter
Fewkes, chief, Bureau of American Ethnology; Mr. N. Hollister,
superintendent, National Zoological Park; and Mr. W. P. True,
editor of the Smithsonian Institution, secretary. Toward the close
of the year there were added to the membership of the committee
Dr. Marcus Benjamin, editor of the National Museum, and Mr.
Stanley Searles, editor of the Bureau of American Ethnology.

LIBRARY

The service of the libraries administered under the Smithsonian
Institution has been continued, although with increasing difficulty
owing to the need for more assistants. Mr. Paul Brockett resigned
as assistant librarian, after 37 years with the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, in order to assume charge of the new building of the National
Academy of Sciences as assistant secretary and librarian.

The additions to the libraries reached a total of 12,249, as com-
pared with 10,938 the past year. The number of loans was 13,326,
as compared with 12,076 the past year, exclusive of books lent from
the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress. Efforts to
secure missing parts for including in incomplete sets resulted in the
receipt of 1,786. Owing to the lack of sufficient clerical help, it
has not been possible to have typed for the general library catalogue
the catalogue cards of special collections that have been prepared
during the year. Consequently the number of volumes catalogued
for the general catalogue dropped from 6,341 to 5,348.

Probably the most important addition of the year was the Edgar
E. Teller collection presented by Mrs. Teller to the library of the
United States National Museum. The catalogue of the European
Historical Series of the Watts de Peyster collection is approaching
completion.

NATIONAL MUSEUM

Since 1916 the collections in the care of the Museum have been
increased by two and one-fourth million specimens, and its exhibi-
tion space has been enlarged by the addition of the Aircraft Build-
ing. Unfortunately, however, the appropriations have not kept pace
with this rapid development, and it is now only with the greatest
care and economy that the actual work of the safe-keeping of the
collections and their classification and exhibition is carried on.
There is practically nothing left to care for the normal expansion
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of the Museum’s work ‘and for increasing its usefulness to the people
of the country. The Museum, with its vast collections, serves the
public not as it would and could but as its limited financial resources
permit. One forward step has been made, however, in the reclassi-
fication of salaries which becomes effective on July 1, 1924, and as
a whole the scientific force of the Museum is at last to receive ade-
quate compensation.

The outstanding feature of the year was the gift to the Nation
for exhibition in the National Museum of a complete American
colonial room, presented by Mrs. Gertrude D. Ritter, of Washington,
D. C. This notable gift includes wall paneling from the old Bliss
homestead at Springfield, Mass., and a remarkable collection of fur-
niture, china, glassware, pewter, pictures, and textiles belonging to
the same period of early American history. The room is set up and
arranged in one of the Museum rooms exactly as it would have
appeared in a colonial home of the period of about 1750.

A program of intensive work on the development of the Loeb col-
lection of chemical types was made possible this year through the
accrued interest on the Loeb fund. A curator of the collection was
appointed and the advisory committee reorganized, and it is ex-
pected that in a year or two the value of such a type series of chem-
icals will be amply shown.

The Museum received during the year 362,942 specimens, a notable
increase over last year in numbers and also in scientific value.
Over 8,000 duplicate specimens classified and labeled were dis-
tributed for educational purposes to schools and colleges. A some-
what detailed account of the accessions in the various departments of
the Museum is given in the report of the administrative assistant in
charge, and only a few of the more notable acquisitions will be men-
tioned here. In anthropology a noteworthy collection of ethnological
material from the Philippines, made by the late Capt. E. Y. Miller,
was presented by Mrs. Florence G. Miller, and a number of speci-
mens representing several Indian tribes of South America was the
gift of Dr. D. S. Bullock. A valuable series of unique ancient
earthenware bowls from the Mimbres Valley, N. Mex., was presented
by the Bureau of American Ethnology. <A series of prehistoric
antiquities from ancient sites in France, Belgium, and Germany was
added by Dr. AleS Hrdlitka as the result of his recent trip to
Europe.

The collections received in biology greatly surpass those of recent
years both numerically and in scientific importance, the latter point
being emphasized by the addition of a large number of species and

genera new to the Museum, many gaps in the collections having been
filled. The outstanding accession of the year is the gift by Dr.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 1

J. M. Aldrich, associate curator of insects, of his collection of 45,000
specimens of dipterous flies, the result of his life’s collecting and
study. Considerable collections were received from Rev. D. C.
Graham, made during his explorations in the Province of Szechwan,
China. Dr. W. L. Abbott secured a large number of plants, reptiles,
and amphibians during an expedition to Santo Domingo. The
National Herbarium was greatly enriched by three expeditions to
tropical America, that of Dr. A. 8. Hitchcock to Panama, Ecuador,
Peru, and Bolivia; of Paul C. Standley to the Canal Zone and Costa
Rica; and of Dr. William R. Maxon to Panama, Costa Rica, and Nica-
ragua. The research work of the staff of the department of biology
has been continued whenever time could be spared from the neces-
sary work of caring for the increasing collections, but the divisions
are greatly undermanned and much more scientific work would be
accomplished if more assistants were available.

The department of geology received a large amount of material
of unusual value for both exhibition and study purposes, the most
noteworthy accessions being the large sauropodous dinosaur from
the Dinosaur National Monument, Utah, and the Edgar E. Teller
and George M. Austin collections of fossils, which together comprise
at least 125,000 specimens. The economic collections have been in-
creased by the addition of a number of ores and by a series of
diamond-bearing rocks from Arkansas. Meteoric irons from New
Mexico, Kansas, Chile, Spain, and Australia added new material to
the meteorite collection. The mineral collections received a number
of specimens chiefly through the generosity of Col. Washington A.
Roebling, and several cut gems were added to the Isaac Lea collec-
tion. Expansion of the study series and research work occupied
much of the time of the curators and their assistants.

The divisions of mineral and mechanical technology received many
interesting additions, including two automobiles presented by the
Cadillac Motor Co., one made in 1903 and the other in 1923, the
latter being cut away in cross section to show the working parts.
Another valuable accession was a complete working unit of a
Strowger automatic telephone system equipped with three telephones
which can be operated by the visitor, thus enabling him to observe
the functioning of the apparatus. The division of textiles, includ-
ing also wood technology, organic chemistry, foods, and medicine,
received over 3,300 specimens during the year, including large
series of industrial specimens illustrating every branch of rubber
manufacture, the manufacture of leather and shoes, and the prepara-
tion and dyeing of seal, muskrat, and rabbit skins. There were also
accessioned many chemical materials used in various industries, a
number of interesting textiles, and material of value to be added
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

to the exhibitions in the division of medicine. The division of
graphic arts received numerous additions pertaining to the history
and development of the printing art and held a number of suc-
cessful exhibitions of prints, etchings, lithographs, and photographs.
In the division of history the most notable addition was the Ameri-
can colonial room presented by Mrs. Gertrude D. Ritter, mentioned
previously in thissummary. The division also received a gown worn
by Mrs. Warren G. Harding and another worn by Mrs. Benjamin
Harrison to be added to the collection. of costumes of ladies of the
White House in which so much popular interest is shown.

The Museum participated in a number of field expeditions which

have resulted in greatly increasing the collections in the various .

departments. These are described in the report on the Museum ap-
pended hereto. The auditorium was used by a large number of
scientific and other societies and organizations for lectures and
meetings. Visitors to the Natural History Building during the
year totaled 540,776; to the Arts and Industries Building, 290,012;
to the Aircraft Building, 43,534; and to the Museum exhibits in the
Smithsonian Building, 104,601. Eight volumes and 44 separates
were published by the Museum during the year, and of these 78,734
copies were distributed.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

The year has witnessed substantial advance in the work of the
gallery, and a number of important art works were received notwith-
standing the fact that there is no longer suitable space available
for the display of additional exhibits. Constant effort has been
made during the year to impress upon the country the urgent need
of a National Gallery Building, and gratifying assurance of the
awakening of public interest in national art is given by the intro-
duction in the Senate by Senator Lodge of an amendment to the
deficiency appropriations bill to provide for commencing the erec-
tion of a suitable building for the gallery. Although this amend-
ment did not pass at the last session of Congress, it is hoped that
favorable action will soon be taken. It will be recalled from last
year’s report that Congress has provided a site in the Smithsonian
grounds for such a building and that funds were raised privately
for the preparation of plans. At the close of the year Mr. Charles
A. Platt, the architect selected, had the plans well under way.

The annual meeting of the National Gallery Commission was held
on December 11 and a number of important topics were considered,
including the problem of securing a National Gallery Building, a
recommendation that a division of historical architecture be included
in the National Gallery of Art, and the selection of an architect for

a at
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 19

the proposed building. Mr. Gari Melchers was selected to succeed
Mr. Daniel C. French, who had resigned as chairman of the
commission.

Permanent accessions to the gallery for the year were limited to
about 10 paintings, but Mrs. Ralph Cross Johnson deposited a
collection of 11 early Christian paintings by Italian, Dutch, Flem-
ish, and Spanish masters, and has indicated her intention of making
the “deposit ” a permanent addition to the gallery. A number of
loans were accepted during the year, and the gallery in turn loaned
a number of paintings to accredited art institutions. Three special
exhibitions were held in the gallery during the year, and the World
War portrait collection was installed in an improvised gallery on
the second floor of the Natural History Building of the National
Museum, which proved to be quite satisfactory for their exhibition.

FREER GALLERY OF ART

Work completed during the year includes the examination, classi-
fication, and cataloguing of Chinese and Japanese stone sculptures
and paintings, and much additional work has been accomplished in
the preservation, framing, lettering, and mounting of paintings,
etchings, and lithographs. Identification photographs have been
made of many objects in the collection to provide ready reference
and to save handling of the collections. A special exhibition of
Whistler etchings, dry points, and lithographs was held in four of
the galleries during January and February. Fourteen hundred gal-
lery books describing the objects on exhibition have been prepared,
and there have also been issued a Synopsis of History for the use of
students and a third printing of the pamphlet giving general infor-
mation about the gallery and collections.

Additions to the collections by purchase included Chinese bronzes,
Indian paintings, Persian paintings, and Chinese sculptures, and the
library was increased by the addition of a number of books and
pamphlets in various Asiatic and European languages. Several
cases, picture frames, and other necessary articles of equipment were
constructed in the gallery workshop.

The total attendance for the year was 111,942, including 482 visi-
tors who came to work in the study rooms or to examine objects not
on exhibition. The auditorium of the gallery was used in February
by the Library of Congress for the presentation of three recitals of
chamber music, and in April, Prof. Paul Pelliot, of the Collége de
France, gave an illustrated lecture on “Chinese bronzes, jades, and
sculptures.”

The archeological expedition to China under the joint auspices of
the gallery and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, has carried on
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

fruitful investigations in various localities in China, latterly at
Yii-ho Chén, in Honan, where some burials of the Han dynasty have
been thoroughly investigated with gratifying results. Even more
important is the cooperative agreement with regard to archeological
investigation established between the gallery and the Chinese au-
thorities. which was confirmed by the unsolicited appointment of
Mr. Bishop as Honorary Adviser in Archeology to the Historical De-
partment of the Chinese Government. This is the first definite effort
of the kind to bring Chinese archeologists and officials together in a
beneficial relationship with western archeologists and museums,
which it is hoped will provide a basis for more enlightened scholar-
ship and gradually supplant the ruthless and unscientific collecting
of Chinese antiquities on a commercial scale as hitherto allowed.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

The aim of the Bureau of American Ethnology is to discover and
disseminate correct ideas of the Indian as a race, that our people
may better understand and appreciate his history, language, soci-
ology, music, religion, and various arts and industries. The sources
of this information are from year to year becoming fewer and fewer
as the customs indigenous to America are lost in the settlement of
the former homes of the Indians by the white race. It is therefore
imperative that intensive work be carried on by the staff of the
bureau to record accurately as much as possible of this material from
the Indians themselves before it is too late.

The greatly increased number of visitors to the national parks and
Indian reservations of the Western States, due to the present popu-
larity of automobile touring, has led to a desire on the part of the
general public for more information on the history and customs of
the Indians, and urgent calls from universities and other institutions
for advice and assistance in local problems relating to the Indians
have been more numerous than ever before. The bureau’s most effec-
tive means of supplying this information and answering these calls
is its unique series of publications on every phase of Indian 'ife and
culture. With the greatly increased cost of printing and the very
limited funds for the purpose placed at the disposal of the bureau,
there has resulted a very unfortunate congestion of manuscripts
awaiting publication. It is usually two or three years after a report
is handed in by a member of the staff before it can even be sent to
the printer, which not only results in difficulty in supplying the
requests of the public but is very discouraging to the scientific staff
who are carrying on this work.

A large proportion of the time of the chief of the bureau is de-
voted to administrative work, but opportunity was found to carry on

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 21

an archeological expedition to southwestern Florida, where but little
work of this character has previously been done. With the aid of
Mr. E. M. Elliott and his associates, of St. Petersburg, Doctor Fewkes
began the excavation of certain large shell mounds on Weeden Island
near St. Petersburg. One of the largest mounds proved to be a ceme-
tery, and from November until March about one-half of it was ex-
eavated. A large collection of aboriginal objects and skeletons was
made, which gives evidence of two distinct cultures, one above the
other. The lower contained crude pottery and a few implements
mostly of shell bearing considerable likeness to the so-called Archaic
Antillean culture of Cuba. The upper layer gave very fine specimens
of decorated pottery and other objects which show close relationship
to the Indian culture of Georgia, indicating a southward extension of
population possibly allied to the Muskhogean into the Florida Pen-
insula. This field work of the bureau in Florida inaugurates a plan
of cooperation of members of the staff and others to determine the
boundaries and extension of the great Muskhogean culture of the
Gulf States, the object being to obtain information on the relation-
ship of the mounds of our southern States to those of the Huastecs
on the Gulf coast of Mexico.

Dr. John R. Swanton completed the translation of stories from his
Koasati, Alabama, Hitchiti, and Creek texts; edited a manuscript on
Indian trails by the late W. E. Myer; and began the preparation of a
card index of all words in the Timucua language in the religious
works of the Franciscan missionaries Pareja and Movilla, nearly all
that is left to us of this old Florida tongue. Dr. Truman Michelson
carried on ethnological studies among the Indians of Labrador.
From his work it appears that the language of the Nascopi and Davis
Inlet Indians is the same, and merely a Montagnais dialect rather
than a distinct language. It may be noted that the folklore of the
Indians of Labrador contains more elements occurring among Cen-
tral Algonquians than has been suspected. At the close of this work,
he continued his researches of former years among the Fox Indians
at Tama, Iowa, devoting especial attention to the ceremonial runners
of these Indians.

Mr. J. P. Harrington took charge of the exploration of the Burton
Mound at Santa Barbara, Calif., under a joint arrangement with the
Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. Many facts of
interest for the prehistory of the Santa Barbara Indians and the early
culture of the Pacific coast in general were recorded, and a great
number of skeletons, utensils, weapons, and trinkets were secured.
Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was engaged during the greater part of the year
in working up the material gathered in former years relating to the
League or Confederation of the Five Iroquois Tribes or Nations. In

20397—25——3
22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

June he visited the Six Nations of Iroquois near Brantford, Ontario,
Canada, and the Onondaga, Tonowanda, and Tuscarora in New
York State for the purpose of securing certain data regarding the
Condolence and Installation Council.

Mr. Francis La Flesche devoted his time to the assembly of his
notes on the child-naming rites and ceremonies of the Osage Indians.
Mr. La Flesche has succeeded in securing two of the remaining ver-
sions of these rites which are now practically obsolete, and these will
form the two parts of a publication on the subject, now nearing com-
pletion. Mr. W. E. Myer on his return from field work in Tennessee
began preparation of a report on the remains of the great prehistoric
Indian settlement known as Great Mound Group in Cheatham
County, Tenn. The great central mound of this ancient town was
protected by earthen breastworks surmounted at intervals by circu-
lar wooden towers, and completed by earthen bastions projecting 150
yards beyond the main walls. In addition to this fortified mound,
there were four other eminences with tops leveled into plazas, which
showed evidences of earth lodges and former buildings.

Miss Frances Densmore recorded songs of the Makah Indians at
Neah Bay, Wash., in order to compare the music of Indians living
beside the ocean with that of tribes living on the mountains, plains,
and desert. It was found, as a general observation, that the music
of the Makah resembles that of the Ute, Papago, and Yuma more
than that of the Chippewa, Sioux, and Pawnee. The Makah songs
recorded included songs of the whale legends and whaling expedi-
tions, songs of the potlatch and various social dances, songs con-
nected with contests of physical strength, “gratitude songs,” lul-
labies, courting songs, and songs of wedding festivities.

The publications of the bureau issued during the year consisted of
three bulletins, and a number of other bulletins and reports were
in press at the close of the year. There were distributed during the
year 13,974 copies of the publications of the bureau.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES

The total number of packages handled by the exchange service
during the year was 460,658, weighing 567,107 pounds, an increase
over last year of 82,832 packages and 74,291 pounds in weight. This
increase was due for the most part to the large number of publica-
tions received in this country for transmission to universities and
colleges in Japan that lost their libraries during the recent earth-
quake.

The Institution was notified during the year that the Government
of Hungary had established the Hungarian Libraries Board at
Budapest to act as the Hungarian exchange agency, and that the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 93

Governments of the Dominican Republic, Latvia, and the Free City
of Danzig had adhered to the two exchange conventions concluded
at Brussels, March 15, 1886.

The number of full and partial sets of United States official docu-
ments sent through the exchange service to depositories abroad is
now 97, there having been added during the year to receive full sets
the Ministry of Finance, Government of Northern Ireland, Belfast;
State Library, Reval, Esthonia; and the Library of the League of
Nations, Geneva, Switzerland. In addition, there is an immediate
exchange of the official journal between the United States and 41
foreign governments. During the year, this immediate exchange of
the official journal has been entered into with Haiti, Latvia, and
Norway.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

The year has veen one of the most successful in the history of the
park, both as to care and maintenance of the animal collections,
buildings, and grounds, and in service to the public. All previous
attendance records were broken by the total of 2,442,880 visitors re-
corded for the year. Among the 221 animals presented to the park
during the year were many rare and unusual species, including a fine
young Baird’s tapir presented by Mr. M. G. Henery, of Honduras.
This species of tapir has always been one of the rarest animals in
zoological collections. Through the continued interest in the park
of Mr. Victor J. Evans, of Washington, D. C., 55 animals were added
to the collections including several very rare and valuable species.
A most interesting collection from Brazil was brought to the park
by Dr. W. L. Schurz, commercial attaché, United States Embassy,
Rio de Janeiro, which included a fine South American bush dog, the
first of its kind to be shown in the park.

There were 1,645 animals in the collection on June 30, 1924,
including 458 mammals of 177 species, 1,059 birds of 276 species, and
128 reptiles of 41 species. The number of animals added during the
year was 491, while 614 were lost through exchange, death, and
return of ‘animals on deposit. Forty-two mammals were born and
27 birds hatched in the park during the year, while the death rate
was held at a normally low mark.

The 11 new yards for hoofed animals mentioned last year were
completed during the year and occupied by animals in the fall. The
superior arrangement of these paddocks for the care and exhibition
of the animals has been favorably commented on by officials of other
zoological gardens and by visitors. A new restaurant building,
needed for many years, was completed during the year, which adds
greatly to the appearance of the park and is much appreciated by
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

visitors. The most urgent present needs of the Park are a new
exhibition building for birds, the present one being in very bad
condition and much too small for the large crowds which visit it,
and a fund for the purchase of rare and unusual animals. This
fund might be increased by gift or bequest and by depositing in it
certain miscellaneous revenues of the park which ‘are now turned
into the general fund of the Treasury, if this were authorized by an
act of Congress.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

During the year arrangements were made, through the generosity
of Mr. John A. Roebling, to have sent to the Institution daily tele-
graphic reports of the solar constant value from the two solar radia-
tion stations at Montezuma, Chile, and Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz.
Experimental temperature forecasts for New York City, based on
these daily reports of solar changes, have been regularly submitted
by Mr. H. H. Clayton for certain periods of time, namely, for 3, 4,
5, and 27 days in advance and also general forecasts as to the ex-
pected departure from mean normal temperatures for the coming
months and weeks. These forecasts show undoubted prevision of
the temperature even up to 5 days after the solar observations.
The 27-day detailed forecasts have hitherto shown no correlation
with New York City temperature, but the broader forecasts for
coming weeks and months have been fairly verified. The results
are promising enough to warrant further trial, and through Mr.
Roebling’s generous support these experimental forecasts will be
continued until June 30, 1925.

Three projects were undertaken at the Mount Wilson station,
which the director occupied from July to October, 1923: First, to
begin observations on the variations of atmospheric ozone ; second, to
test new improvements on the solar cooker; and, third, to measure
the spectra of the brighter stars, using the 100-inch telescope and
special apparatus prepared for the work. In the first project ap-
paratus was made ready, but circumstances prevented the actual
beginning of the determinations of atmospheric ozone; in the sec-
ond, experiments with the solar cooker resulted in some advance-
ment and pointed the way to further progress; and in the third
highly interesting results on stellar spectrum distribution and on
star diameters were obtained.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITER-
ATURE

The condition of the International Catalogue of Scientific Litera-
ture remains practically the same as it was last year. It will be

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY : 25

recalled that publication of the catalogue was suspended in 1921,
owing to the fact that such abnormal conditions in international
exchange and publishing costs had been brought about by the war
that. many of the cooperating nations were unable to pay the conse-
quent increased prices of their subscriptions. However, the need of
this classified index to the ever-increasing literature of science is
greater now than ever before, for no publication or combination of
publications has even attempted to fill its place, and it is to be
regretted that so much effort is being independently expended to
meet special requirements when it is evident that, should these
separate undertakings be either merged or at least brought into
cooperation all would be benefited and the long-felt needs of special-
ists and librarians thus be fully met.

The International Catalogue is in a position, through its officialiy
recognized bureaus, to prepare index data to all of the scientific
publications of the world, this being a feature which no new organi-
zation can even hope to duplicate. The local bureaus, being officially
recognized and in a position of close contact with both publishers and
authors of scientific papers, have unique facilities for providing the
data necessary for abstracts and special indexes, and as such data
is needed by all agencies supplying notices of scientific publications
in whatever form, it is felt that this organization should be the
foundation on which to build a cooperative service to meet the needs
of all interested in scientific activities.

JOHN L. BAER

Mr. John L. Baer, employed by the National Museum for several
years past as temporary assistant in the department of anthropology,
died in Panama on May 28, 1924. Mr. Baer was sent to represent
the Smithsonian Institution on the Marsh Darien Expedition and his
death occurred in Panama just before the return of this expedition.

Mr. J. J. Dolan, employed by the National Museum in various
capacities for 82 years, died on November 22, 1923. Mr. Dolan
entered the service of the Museum as watchman and passed through
the various grades until he reached the position of captain of the
watch in 1903. This position he held until April 15, 1923, when he
was transferred to the office of shipper, which position he held at the
time of his death.

APPENDIX 1
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the con-
dition and operation of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1924.

The maintenance of the National Museum for the year was pro-
vided for by a Government appropriation of $452,500 in the execu-
tive and independent offices act approved February 13, 1923, with an
added item of $79,896 for increase of compensation to care for the
bonus of the employees. In 1916 the appropriation to the Museum
for all purposes was $426,000. Since 1916 the Museum has increased
its exhibition space by the acquisition of the Aircraft Building; has
materially enlarged the scope of its collections in arts and indus-
tries and in history, and has received over two and one-fourth mil-
lion additional specimens, besides assuming certain definite responsi-
bilities for the guarding and upkeep of the Freer Building. As can
be readily seen, the difference in the appropriations of 1916 and 1924
hardly covers the added cost of maintaining the buildings and
guarding the collections, leaving little or nothing to provide expert
assistance needed in carrying out the fundamental requirement of
the classification of the added collections. The growth of the
Museum in all directions continues to be increasingly conditioned by
its limited finances. Economies of all kinds are resorted to in mak-
ing the appropriation provide first for the safe-keeping of the collec-
tions and then for their classification and exhibition. The Museum
with its vast collections serves the public not as it would and could
but as its limited financial resources permit.

During the year the scientific staff of the Museum was held intact
with very few exceptions, doubtless due to the approaching read-
justment under the classification act of 1923, which becomes effective
July 1, 1924. As reported last year, tentative allocations of all posi-
tions in the Government bureaus under the Smithsonian Institution
were submitted to the Personnel Classification Board by the writer
as liaison officer of the Institution. The board this year reviewed,
revised, and approved, with few exceptions, the allocations of the
Museum employees. The few positions still awaiting the board’s
final approval will, it is expected, be settled within a few days. The
results of the classification act are far-reaching. The scientific force

27
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of the Museum is at last to receive adequate compensation, as a whole.
There is, however, still one lot of scientific workers whose gradings
must be revised to put them on an equality with similar employees
elsewhere, but this will doubtless soon be satisfactorily adjusted.

The outstanding feature of this year was the addition to the
Museum exhibition halls of an American colonial room, the gift of
Mrs. Gertrude D. Ritter, as mentioned elsewhere in the report. This
is the first period room to be permanently installed in the Museum.
One of the foyer rooms in the Natural History Building has been
entirely transformed and now preserves the home atmosphere of the
early settlers of our country.

The time has come, with the continual stream of additions to the
collections, when new objects can usually be displayed only by with-
drawing from exhibition other objects, often of equal interest. The
installation of the colonial room necessitated the condensation of
the District of Columbia faunal exhibit.

The Museum was able by curtailing its archeological exhibition
to materially assist the National Gallery of Art. The pressing needs
of the gallery for additional hanging space led to the construction of
a gallery 40 feet square in the west end of the east north range,
second floor of the Natural History Building, to accommodate the
nucleus of the National Portrait Gallery. This collection consists
of the series of paintings especially made by American artists of
persons prominently associated in the Versailles peace treaty—the
group picture of the various delegates around the council table, and
22 individual portraits of the distinguished leaders of America and
the allied nations. Designed especially for this collection, the gal-
lery admirably fills its purpose. .

A program of greater development for the Loeb collection of
chemical types was made possible this year through the accrued in-
terest on the Loeb fund, and includes the employment of a chemist
to devote his entire time to its furtherance. The advisory committee
on this collection was reorganized about the middle of the year to
provide representation of the varied governmental agencies in Wash-
ington interested in chemistry. The committee is now constituted as
follows:

Dr. J. E. Zanetti, chairman of the division of chemistry and chemi-
cal technology, National Research Council, ex officio; Dr. C. A.
Browne, Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry, United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture, ex officio; Dr. S. C. Lind, chief chemist of the
Bureau of Mines, United States Department of the Interior, ex
officio; Dr. W. F. Hillebrand, Chief of the Division of Chemistry,
Bureau of Standards, United States Department of Commerce, ex
officio; James K. Senior, representative of the committee in the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 99

Middle West; Dr. C. L. Alsberg, representative of the committee on
the Pacific coast; and F. L. Lewton, representative from the United
States National Museum.

On the recommendation of the committee, O. IE. Roberts, jr., was
appointed curator of the Loeb collection of chemical types on April
1, 1924. Twenty-seven specimens were added to the collection during
the year and several hundred are being prepared for presentation.
It is expected that the intensive work of the next year or two will
demonstrate the value of a type series of this kind.

The collections of the National Museum in the field of the arts and
industries are more and more becoming recognized as a vast refer-
ence book of authentic information. Various governmental agencies
rely upon the Museum’s specimens for the identification and com-
parison of new material. Manufacturers are beginning to realize
that the deposition of their products in the collections of the Museum
acts as an additional protection against suits for infringement, and
those who may have been accidentally granted a patent on an art
that is not new. Several examples of the value of this protection
have recently been brought to the attention of the Museum by patent
examiners and attorneys for patentees. In one case a suit for in-
fringement involving large damages was settled out of court upon
the evidence of a Museum specimen. In two other. cases the denial
by the Patent Office of a patent on a product constructed upon what
were claimed to be entirely new principles was found warranted
after examinations of specimens in the National Museum. The old
adage, “There is nothing new under the sun,” is often shown to be
true when an examination is made of the Museum’s collections. That
feature of the American patent system which denies a patent to an
art or invention that has been shown to the public for two years or
more increases the importance of a great collection illustrating
industrial processes and products and makes it an important refer-
ence book to the United States Patent Office as well as to manu-
facturers, inventors, and the investing public. With the continued
cooperation of American industries these collections will grow in
importance and scope, enabling the National Museum to render
more efficient service along these lines.

The Museum served also in the diffusion of knowledge by assist-
ing the parent institution in its broadcasting program under Austin
H. Clark, of the Museum staff, in whose charge the subject was
placed by the secretary. Arrangements were made for broadcast-
ing from Station WRC, Radio Corporation of America, a talk on
the Smithsonian proper, historical in nature, and a series of sup-
plementary talks on the various major divisions. Seven 15-minute
talks were accordingly given by staff members, the first on October
19 and the last on November 16, 1923.

30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

The conclusion was reached in the spring, as a result of careful
study of radio programs, that the Institution and Station WRC
could to their mutual advantage give a series of informative talks
on special scientific topics. This led to the establishment of a regu-
lar Smithsonian period every Wednesday at 6.15 p.m. The Car-
negie Institution of Washington and the various scientific bureaus of
the Government whose work is more or less complementary to that
of the Smithsonian cooperated in making possible so ambitious a
project. The series was inaugurated on April 9 by a talk by Mr.
Clark on “ The giants of the animal world.” This was followed by
10 others, equally instructive, the last on “Atmospheric electricity,”
by Dr. S. J. Mauchly, of the Carnegie Institution, given in coopera-
tion with the Smithsonian on June 18, 1924. Altogether 18 items
were broadcast by the Smithsonian Institution during the year,
18 different individuals participating, of whom 7 appeared under
the auspices of or in cooperation with the Smithsonian and the
remaining 11 as members of the staff, 7 being from the Museum.
Those who participated in this program are few in number, how-
ever, as compared with those who contributed toward making it a
success hy furnishing information, suggestions, and encouragement.
The series will, it is expected, be resumed in the early autumn.

Lack of spacé makes it necessary at times to refuse objects ten-
dered for the collections, often where the Museum would like to
encourage the intended donor to bring to the Museum not only his
treasures but his problems also, for the Museum renders service in
many ways. By its exhibition collections it conveys a message to
those citizens from all parts of the land who visit their Capital;
by its reserve series it affords assistance to workers in all lines here
represented; by its system of distribution of duplicate specimens
for educational purposes it aids the coming generation all over
the land; by its correspondence it conveys desired information in
response to specific inquiries in many lines; by its publications it
extends the boundaries of learning; and now, by the radio its
service in diffusing knowledge has been extended immeasurably.

COLLECTIONS

The total number of specimens received«by the Museum during
the year was 362,942, exceeding numerically the receipts of the
previous year by over 70 per cent. Not only in numbers is this
year’s increase notable, but in scientific value as well. The incre-
ment is particularly rich in type specimens and in other specially
desired material, filling gaps and otherwise strengthening the col-
lections in many lines. Additional material to the extent of 1,187
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 31

lots, chiefly geological, was received for special examination and
report.

The distribution of duplicates for educational purposes, mainly
to higher schools and colleges, aggregated 8,528 specimens, duly
classified and labeled. Nearly 20,000 specimens and over 90 pounds
of bulk material for blowpipe analyses were sent out, in exchange
for which the Museum has received or will later receive desired
material in many lines. .Nearly 17,000 specimens and some 24
pounds of bulk material were lent to specialists elsewhere for ex-
amination and study.

A résumé of the principal acquisitions of the year follows.

Anthropology.—The department of anthropology reports a favor-
able year, marked by substantial increases in its collections.

In ethnology noteworthy accessions were received from the Philip-
pines, collected by the late Capt. E. Y. Miller, consisting of rattan
fire tongs, bamboo strike-a-lights, decorated gongs, and other ar-
ticles, presented by Mrs. Florence G. Miller; and a considerable
number of specimens from the Araucanian, Aymara, Lengua, and
Chamacoco Indians of South America, gift of D. S. Bullock.

In American archeology is noted an especially valuable collection
of 95 unique ancient earthenware bowls with figures of men and
animals and of group compositions from Mimbres Valley, N. Mex.,
received from the Bureau of American Ethnology. The possibili-
ties of these vessels in the application of decorative art by schools
and manufacturers are great. The collection is also indebted to
Victor J. Evans for the loan of 88 pieces of excellent Casas Grandes
ancient pottery. In Old World archeology there was added a
series of prehistoric antiquities from ancient sites in France, Bel-
gium, and Germany, collected by Dr. AleS Hrdlicka during his
recent trip to Europe. In physical anthropology the most notable
receipt was a large number of skeletal remains from early historic
Arikara Indian village sites near Mobridge, S. Dak., collected by
M. W. Stirling. The collection of musical instruments received
important additions given by Hugo Worch.

The work of the department in installing, rearranging, and pre-
serving specimens was actively carried out. Miss Frances Densmore
prepared a handbook on the collection of musical instruments and
aided in rearranging the exhibit. Among the numerous contacts
of the department with individuals seeking information the talks
given to classes and groups are most valuable and interesting. Many
such talks were given by members of the staff.

Biology.—The collections received by the department of biology
during the year greatly surpass those of the years immediately
preceding, not only numerically but equally so in scientific im-
$2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

portance. The latter point is emphasized by the addition of a large
number of species and genera new to the Museum, many gaps having
been filled and deficiencies supplied. This is particularly noticeable
in the division of birds, where the generosity of Bradshaw H. Swales
has made possible the acquisition of many forms hitherto unrepre-
sented in its collections.

The most outstanding accession of the year is the donation by
Dr. J. M. Aldrich, associate curator of insects, of his private collec-
tion of nearly 45,000 specimens of dipterous flies, representing 4,145
named species and many unnamed, with type material in 534 species,
the fruit of a busy life of collecting and study of these insects by
ene of the leading specialists in this important order.

The activities so auspiciously begun in China, as noted in my
previous report, were continued with gratifying results during the
present year. I have to record with extreme regret the tragic death
of Charles M. Hoy on September 6, 1923, at Kuling, China. It will
be recollected that he was sent to China by Dr. W. L. Abbott for
the purpose of making collections for the National Museum, and it
was during the first trip that the Museum suffered the loss of this
intrepid field naturalist. Rev. D. C. Graham continued his explora-
tions in the western part of the Province of Szechwan. During the
summer of 1923 he made an expedition to Mount Omei and Tat-
sienlu. The collections received contained a large number of topo-
tvnes of species previously described, in addition to many new ones,
some of them from very high altitudes near the Tibetan border.
The National Geographic Society’s expedition under F. R. Wulsin
during 1923 reached the famous Tibetan Lake Kokonor, but the
collections, which are of considerable magnitude, have not been
received as yet. Dr. W. L. Abbott during his expedition to the
island of Santo Domingo during the early winter, though paying
attention chiefly to the Samana region, secured a large number of
plants, reptiles, and amphibians, but the great prize was a series
of skins, skeletons, and embryos representing a genus of rodents
which has not been found alive for nearly 100 years. Dr. Hugh M.
Smith’s activities in Siam, Dr. Casey A. Wood’s visit to the Fiji
Islands, Dr. T. D. A. Cockerell’s expedition to eastern Siberia, and
Secretary Charles D. Walcott’s Canadian expedition also added
materialiy to our collections. Dr. Paul Bartsch and Gerrit S. Miller,
jr., brought back extensive collections from the Bahamas and the
Lesser Antilles, respectively. The National Herbarium was greatly
enriched by three major expeditions to tropical America, namely,
Dr. A. S. Hitchcock’s to Panama, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia; Paul
C. Standley’s to the Canal Zone and Costa Rica; and Dr. William R.
Maxon’s to Panama, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 83

The principal work of the taxidermists during the year has been
the dismantling of one of the largest and oldest of the biologicat
groups in the North American mammal hall, namely, that of the
Rocky Mountain goats. The mounting of the animals for the new
group, which have been collected for a number of seasons by Doctor
and Mrs. Walcott during their explorations in the Canadian Rockies,
has been practically finished and a fair beginning made on the rock
work and other accessories. The arrangement, cataloguing, and in-
stallation of the large material received from collectors in the field
has cost much time and labor, but good progress has been made and
the condition of the study collections is considered very good.

As usual the Museum is under great obligations to a great number
of scientific men connected with universities, museums, and other
institutions all over the country and abroad, for working up such
parts of the collections as are not represented by specialists on the
staff of the National Museum. The research work of the members
of the scientific staff has continued during such time as could be
spared from the routine work, and some important memoirs have
been concluded and published during the year, but the divisions are
greatly undermanned, and more scientific work of a high order
could be accomplished were more assistants available. With the in-
crease in the number of accessions, the opportunity for research
work becomes less.

Naturalists visiting Washington for the purpose of examining the
collections have been given the widest and most liberal assistance in
pursuing their studies, and loans of specimens to scientific institu-
tions and individual investigators in this country and abroad have
been made freely as heretofore. Zoological and botanical duplicates
distributed to high schools, colleges, institutions, etc., aggregated
4,194 specimens, of which 2,086 consisted of mollusks in 14 prepared
sets, and 800 fishes in 9 sets. Exchanges to the number of 14,526
were sent out, of which 2,737 were zoological.

The total number of specimens of animals and plants now in the
collections is estimated at 7,206,816, of which 1,183,700 are plants.

Geology.—The year 1923-24 is notable chiefly on account of the
unusual amount and value for both exhibition and study of the
material received, a total of 227 geological accessions, aggregating
159,921 specimens, being recorded. The paleontological collections
were the chief beneficiaries, the most noteworthy of the accessions
being the large sauropodous dinosaur from the Dinosaur National
Monument, Utah, and the Edgar E. Teller and George M. Austin
collections of fossils, the last two named comprising at least 125,000:
of the total number of specimens received.

The economic collections have been increased by Canadian nickel
and silver ores acquired mainly through the interest of Honorary
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Curator Frank L. Hess, although an instructive series of copper-
nickel-silver ores was donated by the Royal Ontario Museum of
Mineralogy. <A series of diamond-bearing rocks from the Arkansas
fields, received through the assistance of H. D. Miser, made possible
a more comprehensive exhibit of the occurrence of the diamond than
was heretofore shown.

The continued activities of Victor C. Heikes have resulted in the
acquisition of good exhibition material to both economic and min-
eral collections. .

An unusual meteoric iron from San Juan County, N. Mex., formed
the most interesting accession to the meteorite collection, although
an iron from Chile, stone from Kansas, and small quantities of other
individuals from Spain and Australia added new falls and finds.
These were all acquired by exchanges.

The chief contributor to the mineral collections was Col. Wash-
ington A. Roebling, who supplied funds for the purchase of new
minerals and made other gifts. Radium-bearing minerals from the
Belgian Congo and a number of rare species new to the collections,
received as gifts and exchanges, may also be noted. The mineral
collection is reported as now 80 per cent complete in species.

A number of cut gems were added to the Isaac Lea collection
through the Frances Lea Chamberlain fund.

A petrographic reference series of rocks, numbering some 2,000
specimens, and thought to be without doubt the most important col-
lection, from a scientific standpoint, now in existence, was trans-
ferred by the United States Geological Survey.

In addition to the paleontological material mentioned above, col-
lections of Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian invertebrates were
made by Secretary Walcott and members of the staff of the depart-
ment, and a quantity of foreign material was acquired through gifts
and exchanges. A slab of fossil footprints from the Triassic shales
of Virginia, received through the courtesy of F. C. Littleton, was
added to the exhibits.

Satisfactory progress was made in the care of the collections,
though a few changes are to be noted in the exhibits, the installation
of mastodon and bison skeletons, a large slab of rhinoceros bones,
and the slab showing footprints of a dinosaur being the most im-
portant. Expansion of the study series has occupied much of the
time of the curators and their assistants. Research work, however,
has progressed to the usual extent and has been greatly facilitated
by the acquisition of a binocular microscope which was presented to
the department by John A. Roebling.

Mineral technology and mechanical technology.—These divisions
are concerned with engineering developments generally and their
industrial application. The collections endeavor to visualize by
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 85

models and original objects the progress made in the mechanical and
electrical fields, in mineral resource industries, and in transportation
industries on land, water, and in the air. For some unexplained
reason in past years these collections have been augmented spas-
modically, all accessions recorded in any one year being concerned
with a single one or two of the divisions’ activities. This year, how-
ever, the accessions recorded, while but a little higher numerically,
ceteris the collections of every one of the fee in the divisions.
Thus in mineral technology the glass industry exhibit was brought
considerably closer to completion through the generosity of the Corn-
ing Glass Works. Two models of the most recent types of melting
furnaces were presented as well as typical examples of chemical,
industrial, and household oven glassware. The Cadillac Motor Co.
presented one of the first automobiles made by that company in
1903 and also one of its cars made in 1923, the latter being sectioned,
making visible car parts normally hidden from view.

The Automatic Electric Co. donated a complete working unit of
the Strowger automatic telephone system. In this instance the ex-
hibition case is equipped with three telephones which the visitor may
operate and at the same time observe the functioning of the various
parts. To the section of aeronautics there were added the Fokker
T-2 monoplane, which flew in May, 1923, from New York to San
Francisco in a nonstop flight of less than 27 hours, and a helicopter
type of airplane with which Emile Berliner and his son made suc-
cessful flights at College Park, Md., in 1923. The water-craft col-
lections were increased first by the addition of a model of the
steamship Leviathan, transferred from the Alien Property Cus-
todian, and second through the courtesy of the Canadian Pacific
Railway Co., Montreal, Canada, in lending a model of the steam-
ship Lmpress of Russia, one of the vessels of this company plying
between Vancouver and the Orient.

As far as cooperative educational work is concerned, the lecture
work of S. S. Wyer, associate in mineral technology, was of greatest
importance. During the year he delivered 89 lectures on the subjects
of fuel and power resources before many of the schools, normal
schools, and colleges in Pennsylvania and before several educational
groups outside of that State.

Textiles, wood technology, organic chemistry, foods, and medi-
cine.—The collections under the supervision of the curator of tex-
tiles, which, besides textiles, embrace wood technology, foods, organic
chemistry, and medicine, were increased by many gifts and by trans-
fer of property from other Government bureaus, amounting to over
3,200 objects. The most important of these may be mentioned briefly.

Several large series of industrial specimens illustrating every
branch of rubber manufacture, the manufacture of leather and
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

shoes, and the preparation and dyeing of seal, muskrat, and rabbit
skins, were added to the collections, through cooperation with na-
tional trade associations. Exhibits were presented which show the
manufacture and use of new materials from the field of industrial
chemistry and include synthetic plastics and hot-molded and cold-
molded compositions having high dielectric properties. These ma-
terials are used in the manufacture of electric equipment, auto-
mobile parts, musical instruments, ete. Other chemical exhibits
received during the year include glues, coal-tar dyes, and artificial
silk. The textile collections were increased by the gift of fibers,
silk and cotton dress and drapery fabric, and a large series of hand-
~ woven textiles; also hand looms and a commercial braiding machine.
To the collections arranged to show the importance of wood and the
industries based thereon were added products of the hardwood dis-
tillation industry, veneered doors, sporting goods made of wood, and
paper-pulp products. The collections in the division of medicine
were enlarged by 25 models showing advances in sanitary science,
specimens of materia medica, and objects associated with the history
of medicine in America.

Graphic arts—The division of graphic arts held throughout the
year successful temporary exhibitions of artistic prints, etchings,
lithographs, and photographs, which were well attended and favor-
ably mentioned in the press both here and abroad.

The two traveling exhibits of graphic arts were continually in
demand, being singing ed in 18 cities in 9 different States, and the fall
and winter are already well dated up.

No entirely new and complete exhibit for the permanent collec-
tions was received, but important additions were made, especially
to that of letterpress printing and to etching, the latter subject
having been entirely rearranged with numerous additions, the most
important of which was Miss Beatrice S. Levy’s gift of three
aquatint plates for her color print, White House by the Sea. This
method is new to the technical series. The division now has all the
regular methods of printing etchings in color.

Probably the most important accession received by the section
of photography was the motion-picture camera invented by Wallace
Goold Levison in 1887. This machine could expose 12 plates in
rapid succession from one point. This is probably the first motion-
picture camera ever made. Edward Muybridge did not have a
motion-picture camera but had a row of separate cameras, each ex-
posed as the person or animal passed in front, by the breaking of a
string.

History.—The most notable addition to the historical collection
was a number of objects comprising the interior furnishings of an
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 87

American colonial room, presented to the Museum by Mrs. Gertrude
D. Ritter, of Washington, D.C. This collection includes wall panel-
ing, furniture, chinawure, glassware, pewter ware, pictures, textiles.
and miscellaneous objects. The wall paneling, made of American
pine carved with plain designs and fastened with pegs, was taken
intact from the old Bliss homestead located at Springfield, Mass., and
includes a corner cupboard of three shelves with original glass doors
and hinges and latches of wrought iron. In the cupboard and on
the tables are shown the china, glass, and pewter ware belonging to
the exhibit. The china includes an exceptionally beautiful bowl of
Chinese Lowestoft and a child’s tea set of the same ware, a helmet
pitcher, and a number of pieces of luster ware of more than usual
interest. The glassware includes several pieces of Stiegel ware, a
number of plain glass mugs of antique design, a glass pitcher, and a
number of glass bottles of rare types. The collection of pewter in-
cludes plates, mugs, coffee pots, pepper and salt shakers, dishes,
sirup mug, and basin. This collection is unique in character and its
presentation marks an epoch in the development of the collections of
this type in the National Museum. It is the donor’s intention to
add to this collection until the furnishings of an entire colonial home
have thus been assembled. These will be exhibited as a unit in a
house of colonial style to be erected for the purpose in proximity to
the present group of museum buildings.

To the collection of costumes of the ladies of the White House,
which has for a number of years attracted so much public attention,
were added two costumes of great interest. One of these is a white
satin evening gown worn by Mrs. Warren G. Harding during the
administration of her husband, President Warren G. Harding, 1921-
1923, the gift of Mrs. Harding. The other is a gray sill dress worn
by Mrs. Benjamin Harrison at the inaugural ball in 1889 on the
occasion of the inauguration of her husband, President Benjamin
Harrison, and donated by Mrs. James R. McKee, of New York City.
Both these costumes were acquired by the Museum through the gen-
erous cooperation of Mrs. Rose G. Hoes.

The biographical collections were increased by the gift of a pair
of silver-mounted flintlock pistols with leather holsters which were
owned during the War of the Revolution by Maj. Gen. Charles Lee,
of the Continental Army; a sword, a pair of pistols, and a pair of
epaulets owned during the same period by Maj. Jacob Morris, and a
number of other relics of less importance. These were presented to
the Museum by Victor Morris through the Wisconsin Society of
the Colonial Dames of America. Three silver camp cups owned
during the Revolution by Brig. Gen. Anthony Wayne were lent by
Mrs. M. W. Stroud. A gold locket containing a lock of the hair
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of Napoleon I was presented by H. deB. Parsons, Miss Katharine
deB. Parsons, and Livingston Parsons, of New York City. <A very
handsome gold snuftbox, the lid of which is set with diamonds, which
was presented about 1836 to Col. René E. De Russy, United States
Army, by the Prince de Joinville, was donated to the Museum by
Mrs. Laura R. De Russy, of New York City. A silver tureen and
platter presented to the Hon. James R. Mann, Republican leader, by
Members of the United States House of Representatives, Sixty-fifth
Congress, March 3, 1919, were donated by Mrs. Mann.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

The Museum draws its increment in large measure from explora-
tions and expeditions undertaken chiefly by other Government agen-
cies and by private institutions and individuals. This year the
Museum benefited from an unusual number of such enterprises.
Biological and botanical explorations in North America, Central
America, South America, Asia, and various islands added to the
collections representing the fauna and flora of various countries,
while geological field work was carried on within the borders of our
own continent.

During the summer and early fall of 1923 Secretary Walcott, ac-
companied and aided by Mrs. Walcott, was engaged on geological
exploration in the Canadian Rockies in continuation of the work
of previous years. Special studies were made of the Mons forma-
tion of the Ozarkian system, 3,800 feet in thickness, which on the
eastern side of the Columbia River Valley was found to contain
four well-developed fossil faunas, indicating its position between
the Upper Cambrian and Ordovician systems of the geologic time
scale. Collections of fossils illustrating new horizons in the Ozark-
ian system were made in this area, also in the Upper Cambrian and
Silurian limestone of this region, together with small lots of desir-
able biological and botanical material.

Biological explorations in China included the expedition of the
National Geographic Society under Mr. Wulsin along the ‘Yellow
River to Lake Kokonor in Thibet and the field work of Mr. Graham
in the Province of Szechwan, and of Mr. Hoy in Hunan, all before
mentioned. Mr. Graham in his trip to Tatsienlu practically dupli-
cated the route of A. E. Pratt, going by way of Mount Omei, secur-
ing topotype material of species based on Pratt’s and Potanin’s ex-
peditions as well as undescribed material which had escaped his
predecessors.

Arthur de C. Sowerby continued his collecting in China for the
Museum, under the auspices of Col. Robert Sterling Clark, but on
account of the disturbed conditions in that country he was unable
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 39

to go far afield from his headquarters in Shanghai. The resulting
valuable additions furnish serial material for comparison with col-
lections from more remote regions.

An expedition to Japan and eastern Siberia undertaken by Prof.
T. D. A. Cockerell at his own expense, primarily for the purpose of
collecting and studying insects, was productive of large collections
in that class with smaller lots in other natural history classes.

In Siam, Dr. Hugh M. Smith, who is engaged in fisheries investi-
gations for the Government of Siam, collected in a number of local-
ities birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates, important as link-
ing up collections already in the Museum from the Malay Archi-
pelago and Peninsula with those of the countries farther north.

In the Fiji Islands Dr. Casey A. Wood, a valued collaborator of
the division of birds, enlisted the cooperation of several native col-
lectors during a three months’ visit, making very important addi-
tions of birds from that region, including many species hitherto un-
represented, a notable addition to the Fijian material from the
United States exploring expedition under Captain Wilkes. Doctor
Wood arranged with his local assistants to continue the work in
localities he himself was unable to visit.

Under the auspices of the Bureau of Biological Survey, Depart-
ment of Agriculture, in conjunction with the Navy Department, Dr.
Alexander Wetmore visited Laysan, Midway, Johnson, Wake, and
other islands in the Pacific and made large collections, part of
which have already been transferred to the Museum.

Islands in the Atlantic were also visited. Dr. W. L. Abbott’s
expedition to Santo Domingo has already been mentioned, with its
prized specimens of the long-lost rodent. In the Virgin Islands of
the United States and the Lesser Antilles, Gerrit S. Miller, jr., cura-
tor of mammals, made extensive collections of animals and plants
for the Museum at his own expense. Explorations in the Bahamas,
Cuba, and the Florida Keys in August, 1923, and June, 1924, in
connection with experiments in heredity which Dr. Paul Bartsch of
the Museum staff is conducting under the joint auspices of the
Carnegie Institution of Washington and the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, added to the Museum series of mollusks, birds and other
natural history specimens from these regions. The United States
Navy and the United States Army cooperated by furnishing trans-
portation for the workers.

The expedition of A. H. Fisher to the lower Amazon River, Bra-
zil, on which the Museum was represented by C. R. Aschemeier as
mentioned in the last report, was completed early in the year. The
collections made in this region included a few species of mammals
and birds new to the Museum.
40 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Under an arrangement with R. O. Marsh, John L. Baer repre-
sented the Museum on the Marsh Darien expedition undertaken in
the early part of 1924, for collecting anthropological material in a
region poorly represented in the anthropological collections. As
mentioned elsewhere, Mr. Baer died while on this trip and the
collections have not as yet reached the Museum.

Botanical explorations in northern South America conducted
under the auspices of the United States Department of Agriculture,
the Gray Herbarium, and the New York Botanical Garden benefited
the National Herbarium. Dr. A. S. Hitchcock, custodian of grasses,
on this exploration spent four months in Ecuador, two months in
Peru, six weeks in Bolivia, and a few days in Panama. Large col-
lections were obtained, of which a set of approximately 1,700 speci-
mens, exclusive of grasses, was deposited in the National Herbarium.

Two expeditions undertaken for the Bureau of Entomology of
the United States Department of Agriculture by Dr. William M.
Mann, assistant custodian of Hymenoptera in the Museum, resulted
in collections of insects and also specimens in other classes. The
first three months of the fiscal year were spent in Mexico collecting
miscellaneous insects and four months in the spring of 1924 in
Panama, Colombia, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Honduras, collect-
ing insects, especially ants.

Another very considerable miscellaneous collection from Guate-
mala, of which birds formed the conspicuous part, was obtained by
Harry Malleis, who visited the Province of Petén for the Bureau
of Biological Survey, primarily to obtain living specimens of the
ocellated turkey for introduction into this country.

During the spring of 1923 Dr. H. G. Dyar, custodian of Lepidop-
tera, made a trip to Panama, financed by himself, in company with
R. C. Shannon, of the Bureau of Entomology of the United States
Department of Agriculture, whose expenses were paid by that bu-
reau, resulting in many thousand insects, including extensive collec-
tions of mosquitoes, in which Doctor Dyar was specially interested.
Dr. T. E. Snyder, of the Bureau of Entomology, also visited Pan-
ama, securing large collections of termites which will be added to the
National material.

An expedition from the Department of Agriculture to Panama
and Central America was accompanied by Dr. William R. Maxon,
associate curator of plants, the field work in Panama, western Nica-
ragua, and Costa Rica resulting in 4,500 botanical specimens. The
Nicaraguan material will be especially useful in the preparation of
the proposed flora of Central America.

The Panama Canal Zone and Costa Rica were visited also by Paul
C. Standley, associate curator of plants, the expense of the explora-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 41

tions being borne in part by the Department of Agriculture and by
Oakes Ames, who is especially interested in the orchids of Central
America. During two months in the Canal Zone there were ob-
tained about 7,000 numbers of plants particularly desired in prepar-
ing a popular flora of the zone, and 8,000 numbers, including a large
percentage of orchids, were collected during 10 weeks in Costa Rica
for use in preparing the flora of all Central America.

An expedition to the west coast of the United States under Dr.
H. G. Dyar was in the field at the close of the year, studying larve
of mosquitoes. This was financed by Doctor Dyar. Dr. J. M. Al-
drich, associate curator of insects, was likewise at the close of the
year collecting Diptera throughout the high altitudes of the West
and on the west coast of the United States and Canada. All of this
material will eventually find its way into the National collections.

During the summer of 1923 the National Geographic Society con-
tinued archeological explorations at the prehistoric Pueblo Bonito
in New Mexico under Neil M. Judd of the Museum staff. The ma-
terial results have not as yet been officially turned over to the Mu-
seum. This was the third season of explorations which are planned
to extend over a period of five summers. Mr. Judd had just started
the fourth season’s work at the close of the fiscal year.

A second expedition under the same auspices, also directed by Mr.
Judd, penetrated a previously unexplored section of southeastern
Utah, bringing back objects from basket-maker and cliff-dweller
habitations.

The expedition to the Dinosaur National Monument, Utah, under-
taken by C. W. Gilmore, assisted by N. H. Boss, as mentioned in last
year’s report, was completed in the middle of the summer of 1923.
This had for its object the procuring of one of the large dinosaurs
for the exhibition collections. As noted under the chapter on acces-
sions, sufficient material was acquired for a good skeletal mount of
Diplodocus, exceeding in exhibition value anything acquired in the
department of geology in recent years, together with a considerable
quantity of miscellaneous fossils representative of the Morrison
fauna.

The Great Basin ranges of Nevada and Utah were the subject of
stratigraphic and paleontologic work by Dr. Charles E. Resser in
furtherance of Doctor Walcott’s monographic studies. Of the fos-
sils collected many were from entirely new localities.

Field work by Dr. R. S. Bassler, curator of stratigraphic paleon-
tology, during the year included four separate projects: (1) Field
work in the Central Basin of Tennessee, in cooperation with the
State Geological Survey, which resulted in completing the :map-
ping of the geology of the Hollow Springs quadrangle and in
42 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

securing fossils from that area; (2) in southern Kentucky, at the
instance of Dr. Frank Springer, in search of crinoids; (3) in the
Niagaran Plain and neighboring area in Ohio, obtaining information
as to the region from which the Austin collection was secured; and
(4) in northern Tennessee, again under the geological survey of
that State, mapping the geology and securing data toward a report
on the stratigraphy of the State.

The Upper Cambrian and Ozarkian systems, particularly in Wis--
consin, were the subject of the field work in the summer of 1923 of
Dr. E. O. Ulrich, associate in paleontology.

The reported discovery of fossil footprints on excavations in the
red Triassic shale near Aldie, Va., were investigated by C. W. Gil-
more, and numerous dinosaurian footprints were observed at several
distinct horizons. <A fine slab of these was obtained.

Shorter collecting trips to the Miocene deposits along Chesapeake
Bay by N. H. Boss and to near-by localities by E. V. Shannon and
W. F. Foshag provided well-preserved cetacean remains from the
former and small representative collections of rocks, minerals, and
ores from the latter.

The quarries at Deer Isle and Auburn, Me., were inspected by
Dr. George P. Merrill, head curator of geology, who also made a
geological trip into the northern part of that State.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

For some years an additional building to house the National
Gallery of Art and the history collections of the United States
National Museum has been urgently needed. The removal of the
art and history collections would release space in the older buildings
that should provide for the growth of the other collections for years
to come. The executive and independent offices act for 1924, ap-
proved February 13, 1923, authorizes the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution to prepare preliminary plans for a suitable fire-
proof building with granite fronts for the National Gallery of Art
(including the National Portrait Gallery) and for the history collec-
tions of the United States National Museum, to be erected when
funds from gifts or bequests are in the possession of the regents.
A site for the building is designated in the Mall immediately east of
the Natural History Building.

The National Gallery of Art Commission, which has for some time
been giving consideration to the adequate housing of the art collec-
tions, decided at a meeting on December 11, 1923, to raise by private
subscription $10,000 toward preliminary plans for this art and
history building, and that amount was soon subscribed. The Board
of Regents of the Institution accordingly on February 14, 1924,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 48

selected Charles A. Platt, of New York City, on the recommendation
of the commission, as the architect to prepare preliminary plans for
the proposed building. It will be recalled that Mr. Platt was the
architect of the Freer Gallery of Art. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge
proposed an amendment to the second deficiency bill on April 17,
1924, appropriating $2,500,000 to begin construction of a building
the total cost of which should be $7,000,000, but this failed to be
enacted into law. It is to be hoped that favorable action will be
taken in the next session of Congress.

The various buildings housing Museum collections have by the
exercise of the strictest economy been maintained in good condition.
The usual repairs were made to walls, ceilings, and roofs, and to
portions of the roadway on the east of the Natural History Build-
ing. The café in the Arts and Industries Building was closed for
the last two weeks in May and given a needed thorough renovation.
Other changes in the same building afforded better accommodations
for checking umbrellas, for the public-telephone booth, and for the
watch service, and better illumination under the galleries.

The heating season was two weeks longer than the preceding one,
consuming 3,267.2 tons of bituminous coal and 15.8 tons of stove
coal, the former at ‘an average cost of $7.79 per ton against $9.06
the preceding year. Minor repairs of the power plant and adjust-
ments permitted the buildings to be more satisfactorily heated than
in previous years. The electric generating equipment for the first
time since the installation of the power plant has carried a load
approximating its maximum capacity, due to natural increase in
demand for current, as well as the addition of the Freer Building.
The electric feeder leading into the Natural History Building from
the Government contractor’s line in B Street was enlarged to care
for this increased load.

The ice plant produced 301.1 tons of ice, at a cost of $3.003 per ton,
exclusive of labor. During the summer of 1923 it was unable to
produce sufficient ice to meet the demands of all the buildings in the
Smithsonian group. Repairs and renovation in the spring of 1924
made its output meet the demand to the close of the fiscal year.

The Museum fire-fighting equipment was given its customary
regular inspections and tests, and it is expected that all deficiencies
will be remedied shortly. Congress has provided for additional fire
protection for the Smithsonian and National Museum Buildings by
an item in the executive and independent offices act approved June
7, 1924, and arrangements have been made with the Commissioners
of the District of Columbia for the installation in the Smithsonian
Park of additional modern fire hydrants.

The Museum, in connection with the transfer of the Government
collection of coins and medals from the Philadelphia Mint, acquired
the exhibition cases in which the collection had been displayed. The
44 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

cases were built to fit a special octagonal room in the Philadelphia
Mint. They consisted of four wall cases, of three sections each,
built to fit the angular spaces, and a central case—a double-faced
polygon of 14 units, access to the interior fronts of which is through
the space which would have formed a fifteenth unit had the polygo-
nal construction been completed. By shifting the historical col-
lection, the west north range of the Arts and Industries Building
was assigned to the collection from the mint, together with other
similar material already in the custody of the Museum. The dis-
mantling of the highly finished, many angled cases in Philadelphia
and their reerection here reflect great credit upon the Museum cab-
inetmakers and their associates in the undertaking.

There were constructed in the Museum workshops also 13 exhibi-
tion cases and bases and 119 pieces of storage and laboratory furni-
ture. In addition 10 items of storage, laboratory, office, and other
furniture were procured by contract.

MEETINGS AND RECEPTIONS

The National Museum is prevented by its limited maintenance
funds from providing public lectures, as it would like to do, on the
many subjects in which it is interested. It is always ready, how-
ever, to assist as far as possible other governmental, scientific, and
local organizations which so disseminate knowledge.

The auditorium and council rooms served for 105 meetings during
the year, all of which were as usual open to the public. These
gatherings included the National Conference on Outdoor Recrea-
tion called by President Coolidge, which met in the Museum from
May 22 to 24; the nineteenth annual meeting of the American As-
sociation of Museums, May 10 to 13; the twenty-third annual con-
vention of the National Association of Postmasters, October 10-12;
one session on September 3 of the twenty-fourth annual convention
of the United National Association of Post Office clerks; the meet-
ing of the Northern Nut Growers Association, September 26-28;
the meeting of adjutants general of the National Guard of each
State, under the auspices of the Militia Bureau, War Department;
two motion-picture exhibitions by the Public Health Service; a
three-day plant quarantine conference of State and Federal repre-
sentatives and an all-day conference on the Japanese beetle and the
Almeria grape, both under the Federal Horticultural Board; a con-
ference on conservation of the prong-horned antelope, under the
Biological Survey; two meetings with addresses before employees
of the Forest Service; a motion-picture exhibition by the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and a lecture by the Secretary of Agriculture
before the American Committee on the International Institute of
Agriculture; one session of the National Conference on Vocational
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 45

Rehabilitation of Civilian Disabled, under the Federal Board of
Vocational Education; a series of health lectures by emi-
nent physicians arranged by The Woman’s Welfare Associa-
tion on alternate Sunday afternoons from January 13 to April
97, inclusive; the celebration by the Shakespeare Society of Wash-
ington of the tercentenary (1623-1923) of the publication of the
first folio of Shakespearean plays on November 7 and 8, and a bene-
fit for the National Monticello Association by the same society on
December 12; the fifth annual meeting of the American Classical
League; a series of lectures for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts; the
regular meetings of the 1923-24 season of the Anthropological So-
ciety of Washington, the Entomological Society of Washington, the
American Horticultural Society, and the Washington (D. C.) Chap-
ter of the Wild Flower Preservation Society of America; two
meetings by the Audubon Society of the District of Columbia; and
single meetings under the auspices of the Washington Society of
Engineers, the Writers’ League of Washington, the Southern Mary-
land Immigration Commission for the purpose of organizing a gar-
den home association, the Potomac Garden Club, the Light Bear-
ers of Washington, the Puerto Rico Society of Washington, Fed-
eral Post No. 824 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United
States, the Federal Photographic Society, and the Smithsonian
Relief Association.

The exhibition halls were opened for four evening receptions. On
November 13 a reception was tendered to the delegates and
friends of the Southern Medical Association, then holding its seven-
teenth annual meeting in Washington. On January 22 the Archae-
ological Society of Washington, affiliated with the Archaelog-
ical Institute of America, arranged for a reception in the space
assigned the Nationa] Gallery or Art, immediately following a lec-
ture in the auditorium by Count Byron Kuhn de Prorok on “ Ex-
cavations in Carthage.” On April 22 the regents gave a reception
to the members and friends of the American Chemical Society, as 2.
part of their spring meeting in Washington, April 21-25, which
was unusually well attended. On May 22 the first floor and the
foyer rooms on the ground floor were thrown open for the reception
to the delegates to the National Conference on Outdoor Recreation.

MISCELLANEOUS

The number of visitors to the Natural History Building during
the year aggregated 540,776; to the Arts and Industries Building,
290,012; to the Aircraft Building, 43,534; and to the Museum ex-
hibition halls in the Smithsonian Building, 104,601.

As a mark of respect to President Warren G. Harding, all tho
exhibition halls, as well as the offices, were closed at noon, August 8.
46 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

1923, for the balance of that day, and again from 1 p. m. on August
7 until after the funeral at Marion, Ohio, on August 10. Visitors
were also denied entrance to the Aircraft Building from January 11,
1924, to February 4, to permit of the installation of the Fokker air-
plane 7-2.

The Museum published 8 volumes and 44 separate papers during
the year. A publication in the bulletin series of several years ago,
“The Mineral Industries of the United States—Manufactured Gas in
the Home,” was reprinted for a second time through the financial
assistance of the author, Samuel S. Wyer. Museum publications to
the number of 78,734 copies were distributed by the Museum to
libraries and individuals on the regular mailing lists and in response
to special requests. The distribution exceeds the number of copies
printed during the year by nearly 1,000. Some 250,000 labels, repre-
senting nearly 1,100 forms, were also printed, and 163 books were
bound for the library.

The Museum is more and more dependent upon donations and
exchanges in building up its library, since the number of books it can
purchase with its small book appropriation is constantly dwindling.

Books are very necessary tools in the classification as required by
law of objects intrusted to its custody. The additions to the Museum
library this year comprised 1,521 volumes and 2,667 pamphlets,
making a total of 164,748 titles in the library. The number of loans
made was 10,577, of which 6,139 went to the sectional libraries of the
Museum.

Three members of the staff left the Museum through the opera-
tion of the retirement act: W. I. Adams, disbursing agent for nearly
20 years, with service in another bureau of the institution aggre-
gating 28 years in all; Joseph Horan, sergeant of watch, with a serv-
ice of 42 years; and A. F. Adams, classifier in the library, whose
retirement, granted in October, 1923, was effective from June 2, 1921,
with a service of 39 years.

The necrology for the year included Miss E. D. Tabler, clerk for
nearly 41 years; J. J. Dolan, who served in various capacities for
32 years; George W. Spier, honorary custodian of watches; John L.
Baer, Museum representative on the Marsh Darien expedition ; and
Charles M. Hoy, a field naturalist collecting in China for the
Museum through the generosity of Dr. W. L. Abbott. The Museum
also lost by death a number of its long-time benefactors, including
Rev. Alfred Duane Pell and Ralph Cross Johnson.

APPENDIX 2
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the affairs
of the National Gallery of Art for the year ending June 30, 1924:

The fourth year of the existence of the National Gallery as a sep-
arate administrative unit of the Smithsonian Institution has wit-
nessed substantial advance in directions corresponding closely with
those of preceding years, although its activities have been restricted
by the lack of funds for the purchase of works of art, for travel and
for active promotion. The staff, limited to two members, has been
occupied largely in the current work of the gallery, with receiving,
recording, cataloguing and installing collections, permanent and
temporary. A number of important works were received during
the year notwithstanding the fact that the gallery is without suit-
able space for the display of additional exhibits. The discourage-
ment due to the shortage of gallery accommodations is, however,
greatly lessened by the well-grounded expectation that additions of
great importance await only the fulfilling of stipulated conditions
and by the further reasonable expectation that when the contem-
plated gallery building is completed progress will be greatly
accelerated.

During the year constant effort has been made to impress upon the.
country the urgent need of a national gallery building, without
which little progress can be made. A majority of the art works
now owned by the Nation have been acquired simply because there
happened to be available gallery space in the Natural History
Museum in which collectors could see their treasures properly in-
stalled. Although Congress, in 1921, set aside an appropriate site
for a gallery building, it was left to the Institution to obtain the
funds necessary for the employment of an architect to prepare the
plans and for the erection of the building. As the result of an
appeal for the former purpose $11,000 was raised and Mr. Charles
A. Platt was engaged on the plans, this work being under way at
the close of the year. It is feared, however, that funds for the
erection of the building can not be obtained in this way, since the
people incline to the view that the Nation should provide a building
required for purely national purposes.

It is anticipated that Congress will in the near future come to feel
the urgent need of a home for the valuable works of art that patri-

47
48 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

otic citizens have contributed to the Nation and for the still richer
contributions that may be confidently expected when a gallery build-
ing worthy of the Nation is provided. The need of an additional
building in the Smithsonian group is strongly emphasized by the
fact that this building when completed will be called upon to
accommodate not only the arts of painting, sculpture, architecture,
and all the other arts in which the esthetic is a dominant feature
but the extensive collections of the department of American history
which now encroach so lamentably on the space rightfully claimed
by the scientific departments of geology, anthropology, archeology, |
and natural history.

The recent introduction in the United States Senate by Senator
Lodge of an amendment to the deficiency appropriations bill pro-
viding for a gallery building gives gratifying assurance of the
awakening of public interest in national art. The amendment of-
fered is as follows:

To enable the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to commence the erec-
tion of a suitable fireproof building with granite fronts for the National Gal-
lery of Art, including the National Portrait Gallery and the history collections
of the United States National Museum, on the north side of the Mall between
the Natural History Building and Seventh Street, $2,500,000: Provided, That
the total cost of said building complete, including heating and ventilation ap-
paratus and elevators, shall not exceed $7,000,000.

Among the agencies engaged in promoting the gallery’s interests
the American Federation of Arts has taken a leading place. The
task of arousing the people to a realization of the backwardness of
the art side of American culture development is intrusted to the
360 chapters of the Federation distributed widely throughout the
States. In like manner illustrated lectures have been widely pre-
sented, two sets of colored lantern slides illustrating the gallery
collections being in extended use, one under the auspices of the Fed-
eration of Arts and the other of the Federation of Women’s Clubs.
Radio broadcasting has also been utilized with good effect.

NATIONAL GALLERY COMMISSION

The third annual meeting of the National Gallery Commission was
held in the regents’ room of the Smithsonian Institution, December
11, 1923, the following members being present: Herbert Adams, W.
K.. Bixby, Joseph H. Gest, John E. Lodge, Gari Melchers, Charles
Moore, James Parmelee, Charles D. Walcott, and William H.
Holmes.

The secretary of the commission presented a report on the activi-
ties of the gallery for the year and reports of the standing and
special committees followed.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 49

A number of important topics presented for consideration by the
commission were gone over in all necessary detail. It was stated
by the secretary that the war portrait collection, after two years’
circulation by the American Federation of Arts, had been returned
to the gallery and placed on exhibition in association with the
World War exhibits.

The committee appointed by the commission in 1922 to advise with
the committee on the purchase of works from the Ranger fund,
Messrs. Redfield, Melchers, and Holmes, made no report, but it was
announced that during the year 11 purchases were made from this
fund none of which, however, were assigned to the National Gallery.

Attention was given to the resolution submitted by the regents,
February 8, 1923, requesting consideration of the suggestion of cer-
tain architects that a museum of architecture be founded in connec-
tion with the Institution. After discussion, the following resolution
was adopted:

Resolved, That the Commission of the National Gallery of Art recommend
to the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution the inclusion of a division of
historical architecture in the National Gallery of Art. The division should
seek to establish standards in architecture, furniture, and landscape archi-
tecture for the benefit of students and others interested in the preservation of
the historic buildings of America.

Extended consideration was given to the important problem of a
national gallery building, as to its character as the prospective joint
home of national art and national history, and as to the raising of
funds for the construction of a building worthy of its purpose and
of the American Nation. The various agencies that might be en-
listed in the work were reviewed, and the impression prevailed that
obtaining funds for the purpose by subscription was not within the
range of feasibility. The possible adaptation of the George Wash-
ington Memorial Building, now in course of construction, to the
purposes of art and history was suggested.

It was agreed that the first and essential step was the preparation
of plans for the proposed structure, and the raising of a fund for the
purpose was considered. Discussion led to the announcement by a
member of the commission that he would be responsible for one half
of the amount required when the other half ‘is raised. Another
member indicated that he would gladly help, and a committee of
three—Mr. Parmelee, Mr. Moore, and Mr. Walcott—was appointed
to take charge of the task of completing the fund.

The election of officers and members of the commission and mem-
bers of the committees followed. The resignation of Mr. Daniel C.
French as a member of the commission was announced, and Mr.
Gari Melchers was selected to succeed him as chairman of the com-
50 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

mission. Owing to the nonacceptance of election to membership
on the commission of Mr. Denman Ross, Mr. James E. Fraser was
elected to fill his place, and owing to a wrong understanding of the
resignation of Mr. French, which was intended merely as resignation
as chairman of the commission and not from membership in the com-
mission, Mr. Joseph E. Breck was selected to fill the supposed
vacancy. Mr. Breck, however, declined the appointment, making
possible the restoration of Mr. French to the commission from which
his resignation had been accepted under a misapprehension.

A special meeting of the gallery commission was held in the
Regents’ room of the Institution February 11, 1924, to consider the
report of the committee appointed at the December 11 meeting of
the commission to complete the raising of the $10,000 fund estimated
as required for the preparation of preliminary plans for a national
gallery building. Six members of the commission were present—
Gari Melchers, James Parmelee, Herbert Adams, Charles Moore,
Charles D. Walcott, and W. H. Holmes. The funds committee of
three, Messrs. Parmelee, Moore, and Walcott, reported that $11,000
had been subscribed. The commission then proceeded to consider
the question of the character of the proposed building, after which,
complying with the request of the Board of Regents of the Institu-
tion, a vote was taken on the selection of an architect to prepare
plans. The vote of members present, supplemented later by votes of
those not present at the meeting, resulted in the naming of Charles
A. Platt.

The advisory committee on acceptance of works of art met on
December 15, 1923, and the following works, received subsequently
to the previous annual meeting but in large part listed in the annual
report for 1923, were favorably considered: Twenty-two paintings
in pastel, comprising 71 portraits of survivors of the Civil War,
Federal and Confederate, 50 years after the Battle of Appomattox,
painted by Walter Beck; gift of the artist. Thirteen portraits
painted by eminent American artists and representing distinguished
leaders of American and allied nations in the war with Germany;
presented by the national art committee. Bust in bronze of Jeanne
d’Arc, by Madame Berthe Girardet; presented to the American
Nation by the artist, through Mrs. John Jacob Hoff, in these words:
“To the American people in memory of what our soldier boys have
done in France at a crucial time of need”; acceptance by the Smith-
sonian Institution was approved by the committee. Mantel of carved
white holly, with fireplace of pink Numidian marble, from the
recently demolished residence of the late Benjamin H. Warder, 1515
K Street NW., Washington, D. C., Henry Hobson Richardson, archi-
tect; gift of William W. W. Parker. Four paintings, The Storm,

trait of Henry Fuller, 1873, by George Fuller, were lent to the
Dallas Art Association, Dallas, Tex., for its fourth annual exhibi-
tion, held November 14-28, 1923. These works have been returned
to the gallery. The exhibition was international in character, and
a distinguished collection was secured for display.

The Happy Mother, by Max Bohm, was exhibited at the Art
Center, Washington, D. C., on the occasion of a memorial meeting
to the artist, October 20-21, 1923. Mr. Bohm died on September 23,
1923, at Provincetown, Mass.

Art Gallery, Memphis, Tenn., for exhibition there during the Con-
federate reunion in June, 1924. They have been returned to their
places in the gallery.

Two paintings by J. Alden Weir—Upland Pasture and The Gen-
tlewoman—were lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a
memorial exhibition of the work of that artist held in the Gallery of
Special Exhibitions from March 17 to April 20, 1924. These paint-
ings have been returned to the gallery.

Three paintings—Birch-clad Hills by Ben Foster, A Family of
Birches by Willard L. Metcalf, and The Island by Edward W. Red-
field—were lent to the American Federation of Arts, which assem-
bled and sent, through the cooperation of the Department of State
and the United States Shipping Board, an exhibition of paintings
by American artists to be shown at the great international exhibi-
tion in Venice during this spring and summer, 1924.

Thirty paintings by contemporary American artists, largely from
the William T. Evans collection, were lent to the American Federa-
tion of Arts for its traveling exhibition during the season of 1923-
24. These paintings were shipped to the Michigan Art Institute at
Detroit for its exhibit of August 31 to September 8, 1923, and have
since been shown at Nashville, Tenn., Kansas City, Mo., Peoria, IL,
Memphis, Tenn., Lincoln, Nebr., Clay Center, Kans., and New
Orleans, La. They have been returned to the gallery.

The painting by John La Farge, entitled “The Visit of Nico-
demus to Christ,” was lent to the American Federation of Arts for
exhibition at the Carnegie Public Library, Fort Worth, Tex. Since
returned to the gallery.

SPECIAL EXHIBITIONS HELD IN THE GALLERY

A collection of nine paintings by the Tuscan artists Francesco
Gioli (1846-1922) and Luigi Gioli, lent by the Royal Embassy of
Italy, Washington, D. C., was shown on screens in the totem-pole
room at the south end of the gallery.

A special joint exhibition of paintings by Savely Sorin and
sculptures of Seraphin Soudbinine was held in the large central room
of the gallery. The opening view, cards for which were issued by
the Smithsonian Institution, took place on the afternoon of Janu-
ary 10, from 2 to 4.30. The exhibition closed on January 27, 1924.

An exhibit of the art work of Viennese children, pupils of Pro-
fessor Cizek, of Vienna, was held in the lobby of the Natural
History Building, under the auspices of the American Federation
of Arts, May 7 to 19, 1924. This exhibit is being circulated in this
country under the auspices of the Rockefeller Foundation.

INSTALLATION OF THE WORLD WAR PORTRAITS
e

In the annual report for 1923 a brief account was given of the
painting and subsequent history of the World War portrait collec-
tion provided by the National Art Committee, and it may be desir-
able here to repeat the statement there made to the effect that the
original plan for the acquirement of the collection for the Nation
has not as yet been fully carried out. Im order that the gift of
these portraits might have a distinctly national character, it was
planned that a group of two or more, financed by citizens of any
city, should be inscribed as presented by that city. Thirteen of the
portraits were in this manner added to the national collection, while
eight await the reawakening of the patriotic impulse that inspired
the original movement in behalf of a World War collection.

In 1921 the collection was turned over to the American Federa-
tion of Arts by the committee for exhibition purposes, and was
shown in 25 of the principal American cities. On arrival in Wash-
ington, June 12, 1923, the portraits, 20 in number, and 1 portrait
group, supplemented later by a portrait of the Queen of the Bel-
56 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

gians, were installed in the foyer of the New National Museum, in
direct association with the great collection of World War historical
exhibits. This proved unsatisfactory, however, and space was
finally provided on the second floor of the Natural History Museum,
where partitions were erected inclosing a floor space 34 by 37 feet.
This improvised gallery, artificially lighted, although separated
from the gallery proper, proved to be quite satisfactory, and the por-
traits are shown to good advantage.

DISTRIBUTIONS

Loans have been withdrawn by their owners as follows:

Evening; Junipers in Winter, by Ludwig Dill; withdrawn by the
American Federation of Arts.

Portrait of Associate Justice Pierce Butler, of the United States
Supreme Court, by Nicholas Richard Brewer; withdrawn by Mr.
Butler.

Forty-one paintings by Ossip Perelma; withdrawn by Mr.
Perelma.

Portrait of San Lorenzo Guistiniano, by Gentili Bellini; with-
drawn by the American Red Cross through Miss Irene M. Given-
wilson, curator of the Red Cross Museum.

Painting entitled “A Prayer to St. Genevieve,” by Mme. la Mar-
quise de Wentworth; withdrawn by Dr. J. H. Gore.

NECROLOGY

The announcement of the death of Ralph Cross Johnson on July
9, 1923, at his summer home, city of Belfast, Me., where he and Mrs.
Teer had settled for the summer, came as a great surprise and
is deeply regretted by the Smithsonian people, and very especially
by the staff of the National Gallery. Mr. Johnson’s gift to the gal-
lery of masterpieces of painting is regarded as one of the richest con-
tributions ever made to the art treasures of the Nation.

The Rev. Alfred Duane Pell, D. D., of New York City, a bene-
factor of the gallery, died in April, 1924.

Appended to this report is a list of portraits and portrait sculp-
ture, approximately 450 in number, belonging to the Smithsonian
Institution and its branches (not printed). It is intended to serve
as a record of the Institution’s collections in these branches and for
convenience in organizing the contemplated national portrait gal-
lery.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 3
REPORT ON THE FREER GALLERY OF ART

Str: I have the honor to submit the fourth annual] report on the
Freer Gallery of Art for the year ending June 30, 1924.

THE COLLECTION

Work completed during the year includes the examination, classi-
fication, and cataloguing of Chinese and Japanese stone sculptures
and paintings. Further work has been done in the preservation of
oil paintings; 40 Whistler water colors and pastels have been re-
framed, and the titles of those on exhibition have been painted upon
the frames. The relettering of titles and references upon the mounts
of Whistler etchings and lithographs is well advanced and the work
of remounting a certain number has been begun.

Identification photographs of all objects in the collections of pot-
tery, stone sculpture, jade, and bronze, and of a number of Chinese
paintings in panel form have been made. These photographs are
mounted upon the cards of the general catalogue and provide an
easy but accurate means of reference which saves much handling of
the collections. In response to requests other photographs and slides
have been made, reproducing not only objects in the collection, but
also cases and other details of installation, as well as views in and
about the building.

During January and February a special exhibition of 136 Whistler
etchings, dry points, and lithographs was on view in Galleries I, IT,
III, and IV. In May the Chinese makimono, shown in Gallery XIV,
were installed in cases built to receive them. Other changes in ex-
hibition involved 42 oil paintings, 14 water colors, 20 pastels, 5
Indian paintings, 3 Persian paintings, 2 Chinese paintings, 2 Chinese
bronzes, 2 Chinese sculptures, 1 piece of Korean pottery, 1 Japanese
painting.

One thousand four hundred gallery books, giving detailed infor-
mation about objects on exhibition, have been compiled, mimeo-
graphed, and bound for use in all the Whistler galleries, including
the Peacock Room. Through the courtesy of the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts, the Synopsis of History, a parallel chronological table
prepared for the use of students, has been issued in a Freer Gallery
edition, which has had a second printing of 500 copies, while our

57
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

pamphlet giving general information about the gallery and collec-
tions has reached a third printing of 3,000 copies. One thousand
four hundred and eighty-two copies of the foregoing publications
have been sold at the north entrance and on order.

Additions to the collections by purchase are as follows:

BRONZE, CHINESE

23.1. Ceremonial vessel of the type chia. Chou dynasty, 1122 to 255 B. C.
23.2. Toilet box of the type lien. Six Dynasties, sixth century (?).

T’ang dynasty, eighth-ninth century.

Additions to the library, by gift and purchase, comprise 7 maps,
134 pamphlets, and 145 books and periodicals in various Asiatic and
European languages. A list of these additions accompanies this re-
port. (Appendix A, not printed.) The necesary work of examin-
ing the Chinese texts for omissions and duplications due to faulty
printing and binding has been begun and is still under way. Sev-
enty-four volumes of European books have been rebound.

BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT

The workshop has built during the year, one 15-foot case, three
12-foot cases, and two 9-foot cases, with easels to be placed in them;
also, four 70-inch cases, two small square cases, and six stands for
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 59

objects shown in cases. Six new wooden frames for cases were made
and the glass tops for these assembled. For this work a table and
rack with a metal pan was built. Two new pedestals for stone
sculptures were built and the sculptures mounted. The shop has
made also 40 butternut picture frames, which were sent away to be
gilded, 58 reeded French walnut frames, 24 frames for gallery and
other signs, and one large American walnut frame for hanging a
six-fold screen. In the autumn a removable vestibule door for
winter use was built and installed at the north entrance. In con-
nection with the use of the auditorium, the shop built a portable
wooden platform to be placed at times on the concrete stage, and
fitted up closet No. 10 as a cloak room, made a stand and lockable
cover for the projection lantern, built a portable barricade, and
rehung the door leading from the auditorium to the emergency exit.
Locks were placed on all storage cases in storage rooms 3 and 4, and
numerous fittings, such as bronze clamps for makimono on exhibi-
tion, a map drawer in the curator’s office, a device for hanging
kakemono for examination, stands with frames for notices, etc., were
made.

A portable scaffold was built for use in the court in cleaning win-
dows; the joints of the coping of the main walls and court walls
were covered with felt and cement; a picture molding was put on the
west wall of study room No. 1; one section of a new device for modi-
fying the light has been made and installed in the attic; and mis-
cellaneous repairs have been made on objects in the collection and
on furniture and building. .

The shop has also recolored the east wall of Gallery XVI, painted
the floor of study room No. 2, painted numbers in the various sec-
tions of attic and sub-basement in accordance with the architect’s
plan, painted the underside of the skylight glass, and lettered and
painted several signboards. In the summer of 1923 the lettering for
the inscriptions to be placed on the outside of the building was done
by the shop painter after the architect’s design, and later the in-
scriptions were cut by outside contract. By outside contract, also,
weatherproof shades were put outside the north and south corridor
windows.

To the general equipment have been added during the year a mim-
eograph, a stereopticon lantern, and several pieces of office furniture.

The Freer Gallery is gratefully indebted to the Bureau of Fisheries
for the gift of goldfish for the fountain, to the Zoological Park for
the loan of three peafowl, and to the Department of Agriculture for
advice as to the care of the box trees and rhododendrons in the court
and for constant oversight of them.
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924
ATTENDANCE

The gallery has been open every day, with the exception of Mon-
day, from 9 o’clock until 4.30, and with the exception, also, of four
days when it was closed by Executive order at the time of the death
of President Harding. The total attendance for the year was 111,942.
The aggregate Sunday attendance was 28,925, making an average
of 546; the week-day attendance amounted to 83,017, with an aver-
age of 824. Of these visitors, 482 came to work in the study rooms
or to examine objects not on exhibition; 70 to make a study of the
building, storage facilities, lighting, wall-coloring, etc.; 10 to make
copies or studies from objects in the collection, and 35 brought
objects in their possession for examination and information.

On February 7, 8, and 9 the auditorium of the Freer Gallery was
placed at the disposal of the Library of Congress for the presenta-
tion of three recitals of chamber music. These concerts were the
gift to the Library of Mrs. Frederic Shurtleff Coolidge, to accom-
pany her gifts of the manuscripts of 13 modern compositions to the
music division. Seven of these were performed.

On April 29 Professor Paul Pelliot, of the Collége de France, gave
an illustrated lecture on “ Chinese bronzes, jades, and sculptures.”
The total attendance at the concerts was 1,080, and at the lecture
202, making a grand total attendance for the gallery of 113,224.

PERSONNEL

Miss Grace L. McKenney entered as an assistant on October 22.
1923.

Miss Mildren M. Tytus worked as an assistant from November
12 to May 17.

Mrs. Rita W. Edwards was transferred from the office of corre-
spondence and documents on February 16, and was regularly ap-
pointed to the position of stenographer on April 1.

Miss Chie Hirano, librarian of the department of Chinese and
Japanese art of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and Mr. K. S.
Wang, have worked on the cataloguing of Japanese and Chinese
books.

FIELD WORK

Since the activities of the expedition sent to China under the
joint auspices of this gallery and the Museum of Fine Arts, Bos-
ton, have been conveyed to you in detail from time to time through
the reports and correspondence of the field staff, I venture merely
to remind you now of the fruitful investigations carried on during
the year at Hsin-chéng Hsien in Honan; at I Chou in Chihli; at
the tombs of Han Wu Ti, Ho Chii-ping, and others in Shensi; and,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 61

latterly, at Yii-ho Chén in Honan, where some burials of the Han
dynasty have been thoroughly investigated with gratifying results.
But important as the archeological work of our expedition has been,
we are more to be congratulated, perhaps, on our success in estab-
lishing between ourselves and the Chinese authorities a cooperative
agreement with regard to archeological investigation which has
been confirmed by the unsolicited appointment of Mr. Bishop as
Honorary Adviser in Archeology to the Historical Department of
the Chinese Government. An arrangement of this sort was conceived
as the fundamental object of our expedition, and its accomplishment
marks the first definite effort of the kind to bring Chinese archeolo-
gists and officials together in a mutually beneficial and dignified
relationship with western archeologists and museums, thus pro-
viding in some measure, at least, a working basis on which a more
enlightened scholarship may flourish and gradually supplant, let
us hope, the ruthless and unscientific collecting of Chinese antiq-
uities on a commercial scale which has hitherto been allowed and
even encouraged to furnish so much of the material available for
students in this vast and increasingly important field.

Mr. Bishop’s detailed account of his field activities accompanies
this report as Appendix B (not printed).

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 4
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the re-
searches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1924. These
were conducted in accordance with the act of Congress approved
June 12, 1923, which contains the following item:

American ethnology: For continuing ethnological researches among the
American Indians and the natives of Hawaii, including the excavation and
preservation of archeologic remains, under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution, including the necessary employees and the purchase of necessary
books and periodicals, $44,000.

The Bureau of American Ethnology was founded by Maj. J. W.
Powell and placed under the direction of the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution by act of Congress. This bureau is de-
-voted to the increase of knowledge of the American Indian, as well
as of the natives of Hawaii and the aborigines of Porto Rico. It
follows the ideal of the Smithsonian Institution as applied to
researches on the American Indians, including all branches of their
archeology and ethnology. The bureau publishes annual reports and
bulletins, the whole number of these thus far published being 40
reports and 81 bulletins. The former assume the form of me-
moirs, often large and highly technical; the latter are generally
smaller in size, often preliminary in character.

The fundamental idea which led to this appropriation was the
recognized necessity for reliable information for a proper appre-
ciation of the Indian, as an aid to legislation. Very extravagant
and diametrically opposite opinions were rife regarding the char-
acter of our aborigines. In the early days of contact of the Euro-
pean and Indian races erroneous romantic ideas were largely
prevalent, but with the application of the science of anthropology
new values of Indian character developed. The Indian in some
quarters was regarded solely as an object of research; the humani-
tarian side was lost sight of, and the fact that he is a man belonging
to one of the most important races in the ultimate amalgamation of
the different peoples was overlooked. The aim of the Bureau of
American Ethnology is to discover and to disseminate correct ideas
of the Indian as a race, that our people may better understand and

62
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 63

appreciate his history, language, sociology, music, religion, and
various arts and industries. It is obligatory for the bureau to pre-
serve accurate records of customs indigenous to America that are
rapidly being lost in the settlement of the former homes of the
Indians by members of the white race. The value of this material
will increase in coming years, for the records that are now being
made are final and in many cases will be the sole objective informa-
tion that posterity will have of the Indian and his customs. This
work is imperative, for within the past few decades a great deal of
information of this kind has disappeared unrecorded, and the prob-
ability is that this generation will witness the death of most aborigi-
nal survivals in culture.

While the ideal of the bureau is the acquisition of knowledge and
the publication of the same through reports, there has grown up a
great deal of work on related subjects that absorbs more or less of
the time of the chief and his staff. Information is sought from all
quarters regarding the Indians, and urgent calls from State insti-
tutions and universities asking for advice and help in local prob-
lems have been more numerous than at any other time in the his-
tory of the institution. Routine office work has assumed in the past
ten years a larger relative proportion than in former decades. Va-
rious agencies have quickened interest in the problems considered
by the Bureau of American Ethnology. The great increase in travel
resulting from the development of the automobile and the founda-
tion of national parks has intensified the desire to “see America
first.’ Our parks and Indian reservations have been visited in the
past few years by an ever increasing number of travelers. This has
stimulated a demand on the part of the general public for accurate
information on the history and customs of the Indians, which the
bureau endeavors to supply.

Tt can not be expected, when the office work has grown to such mag-
nitude and the appropriations have remained practically the same
as they were before the war, that the quantity of research in the field
can equal that of former years, but the chief has endeavored to have
as many of the staff in the field as he can and to publish the reports
of their work as rapidly as feasible. It is self-evident that the
acquisition of knowledge regarding the Indians, even if not pub-
lished, is a most valuable asset, notwithstanding the fact that it must
be stored in the archives to await a more favorable time for pub-
lication.

The first duty of the chief being administrative and his time
for a large part of the year being occupied with routine matters,
he does not have much opportunity for field work, but notwithstand-
ing this fact scientific work of a limited nature has been done by him
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

in the field. He has kept en rapport with the work of all archeo-
logical expeditions in the Southwest in order to be able to advise
you in regard to your recommendations for archeological work on
the public domain. The number of expeditions in the Southwest
has tripled or quadrupled in the last decade.

The field work engaged in by the chief during the past year was
archeological in nature, in cooperation with Mr. E. M. Elliott and
his associates, of St. Petersburg, Fla. There are few areas in the
United States which promise more to the archeologist than south-
western Florida along the shore from Tampa Bay to Cape Sable.
Perhaps no one has added more to our knowledge of this area than
Mr. F. H. Cushing, a former ethnologist of the bureau. The prob-
lems of southern Florida demand more objective material than we
have from the Everglades and the Ten Thousand Islands, where
numerous proofs of a vanished population are in evidence in the
form of enormous shell heaps and earth mounds.

The chief began his researches on Weeden Island, near St. Peters-
burg, which is situated at the end of Gandy Bridge, an artificial
causeway crossing Tampa Bay. The evidences of prehistoric aborig-
inal life on Weeden Island are numerous large shell heaps and
sand heaps which may be divided into groups or types, as kitchen
middens, observatories, foundations of houses, and burial places.
Evidently there was formerly a large village near the highest point
of the island. One of the mounds which was chosen for excavation
turned out to be a cemetery, and in the course of the winter about
one-half of it was excavated. The work extended from November
until March, inclusive.

The chief was not able to be in St. Petersburg the whole winter,
but after having started the work in November, 1923, he returned
to Washington, assigning the direction of the excavations to Mr.
Stanley Hedberg and later to Mr. M. W. Stirling, of the National
Museum, who continued the work until the chief’s return in Feb-
ruary. Asa result of the excavation a large collection of aboriginal
objects was brought to the United States National Museum. This
collection contains many unique specimens and will later be perma-
nently installed in the Museum upon completion of a report on it.
No specimens had formerly been excavated at Weeden Island and the
unique results of this work are regarded as most important. <A pre-
liminary report has been published in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous
Collections, vol. 76, No. 13.

At the present time it is too early to draw final conclusions from
the above work, but it is intended to continue excavations in Florida
in the winter of 1924. Many of the specimens found were not very
different from those characteristic of the west coast of Florida, but
the number of objects is greater and their variations so extensive
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 65

that they are thought to indicate a high development of the abo-
riginal culture in southern Florida. Evidences of two distinct
cultures, one above the other, were determined from the excava:
tions in the Weeden mound. The lower contained crude pottery.
very few implements, mostly of shell, all having a considerable like:
ness to the so-called archaic Antillean culture of Cuba. The uppet
layer contained very fine specimens of decorated pottery in greaf
numbers, showing close relationship to the ceramics of Georgia
This indicates an extension southward or a drift of population.
possibly allied to the Muskhogean, into the peninsula. The rela-
tionship of the people of the lower layer was Antillean rather than
Muskhogean. The inhabitants of southern Florida, when the earliest
burials were made in the Weeden mound, probably belonged to an
unknown tribe. The artifacts in the upper layer may be remains
of the Caloosa tribe, which was found there when Tampa Bay was
visited by Ponce de Leon. The Indians that now inhabit the Ever-
glades—the Seminoles—are a late introduction into Florida and of
Creek descent. The numerous Florida shell heaps antedated their
advent by several centuries.

The chief has actively worked during the past year for the forma-
tion of a new national monument on the Little Colorado, near Flag-
staff, Ariz. This monument has been temporarily named the Wu-
paki National Monument and includes ruins at the Black Falls of
the Little Colorado, first described by him in 1900. It is to be
hoped that before another report this most interesting group of
stone buildings will be added to the other archeological monuments.
The ruins that comprise it have some of the best preserved walls
in the Southwest.

The impression exists in some quarters that the work of the
Bureau of American Ethnology must be completed in a certain
definite time. This impression has no real foundation, for ethnology
is like any other scientific study and has no limitations. Every new
year of work in the bureau enlarges the horizon of research and
presents new problems regarding the American Indians for sulution.
Since the foundation of the bureau by the late Maj. J. W. Powell
the aims and tendencies of the science of ethnology have greatly
enlarged, and the published studies of the staff have put the science
of anthropology upon such a firm foundation that not only the past
appropriations but also the prospective expenditures by Congress
are more than justified. The earlier work covered a limited scope;
it pointed out the field for future work. It now remains for the
comparative ethnologist to connect the various problems of mau
and his culture and to shed new light on what still remains unsolved.
By law the ethnological research of the staff of the bureau is limited
to the American Indians and the aborigines of Hawaii. The logical
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

outcome is the enlargement of the Bureau of American Ethnology
into a bureau devoted to the study of all races.

Even in studying the Indians there are great regions of South
America which are practically unknown to the ethnologist. South
America, next to Central America, contains examples of probably
the highest culture that has ever been attained by the American
race. I refer, of course, to the civilization of the great empire of
the Incas, extending from the Isthmus of Panama to southern Chile.
In this prolific field the bureau has done comparatively little, and
the time is now ripe for an extensive exploration in that field. No
less important in South America is the area inhabited by wild
tribes, such as the Matto Grosso and other regions east of the moun-
tains. The remarkable similarity of the culture of the Indians in
Argentina and that of the pueblos especially pleads for more thor-
ough investigation of the former area. The great valley of the
Amazon, that has attracted the ethnologist since the wonderful
voyage of Alex. Von Humboldt at the beginning of the last cen-
tury, still holds out new problems.

The bureau will soon issue a remarkably complete work by Dr.
Walter E. Roth on British Guiana, which probably will be one of
the finest it has ever published. It adds much to our knowledge, but
no more important fact than the magnitude of the numerous fields
remaining to be investigated in northern South America. The lan-
guages, sociology, religion, arts, history, and archeology of almost
every country in South America demand research. Here we have a
great continent awaiting the student of the antiquity and cultural
relationship of the American race.

In the same way the field of Central America and Mexico now
awaits the investigator, although in that particular area the bureau
has made some very important contributions.

There remain special problems of secondary nature throughout
the continent that are as yet unanswered which would be within the
scope of the bureau’s work. All ethnological work on the South
American Indians should have very great influence in uniting more
firmly the republics of Spanish origin and the United States.

Of the many problems awaiting investigation, one of the more
important is the plotting of the trails by which communication was
carried on between Indian tribes. These trails historically followed
by roads and railroads now serve the growing habit of the automo-
bile and the desire of Americans to see their own country. A study
of the foods used by the Indians has a practical value which can not
be overestimated. The number of plants used by the Indians far
outnumbers those on our own table, and the bureau might well give
attention to the discovery of new food resources.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 67

It is desirable to increase the archeological work of the bureau
which thus far has attracted a great deal of attention and which is
one of the foremost departments of anthropological study. This
study should be extended to Florida and the coast States with a
view to determining the relationship of the antiquities of North and
Central America. The investigation of the southwestern portion of
Texas and the adjoining State of New Mexico should be exploited,
especially the contents of the new national monument near Carlsbad
which contains important archeological material. One important
problem is to follow the extension northward of the Huaxtec culture
along the shores of Tamaulipas and Texas to our southern mound
builders.

During the fiscal year Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, com-
pleted the translations of stories from his Koasati, Alabama, Hit-
chiti, Natchez, and Creek texts, and added to them the stories ob-
tained only in English and those in the Tuggle collection; he pro-
vided these stories with footnotes referring to similar tales among
other tribes, and prepared an introduction for the whole. In addi-
tion to this work he has edited and largely recast a manuscript on
Indian trails by the late Mr. W. E. Myer. Also, with the assistance
of Miss Atkins, he has begun incorporating into an alphabetical
card index all words in the Timucua language contained in the re-
ligious works of the Franciscan missionaries Pareja and Movilla—
nearly all that is left to us of this old Florida tongue. Nearly one-
third of the work has been completed.

On the ist of July, 1923, Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist, was
on board the Sagona en route to Labrador. He reached the North-
west River on July 4, where he found a few Nascapi Indians, one
from Davis Inlet, besides the ordinary Montagnais Indians of the
vicinity. From his work among these Indians it follows that the
language of the Nascapi and Davis Inlet Indians is the same, and
that instead of being a wholly distinct language it is nothing but a
Montagnais dialect. Furthermore, it is abundantly clear that the
dialects of the above-named Indians form a distinct unit as compared
to the Montagnais dialects of Lake St. John and Lake Mistassini,
as well as the so-called “ Cree” of Rupert’s House and the East Main
River, which really are not Cree at all but Montagnais dialects.
The report of some Indians to the west of the Nascapi speaking a
language unintelligible to them is worth investigating at a later
date. It may be noted that the folklore of the Indians of Labrador
contains more elements occurring among Central Algonquians than
has been suspected. The very simple social organization of the
Labrador Indians makes it very probable that the rather complex
organizations of the Central Algonquians are unoriginal and are
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

due both directly and indirectly to the influence of non-Algonquian ”
tribes. He was able to measure only a few of the Indians at the
Northwest River, so it is not possible to state precisely which physi-
cal type they represent.

At the conclusion of his work he returned to Rigolet and left
on July 22 for St. Johns, Newfoundland. En route he was able to
take the measurements of a few Eskimos. On his arrival at St. Johns
he proceeded by steamer and train for Tama, Iowa, to renew his
researches among the Fox Indians. He devoted especial attention
to the ceremonial runners of these Indians, and in the course of
the winter submitted a manuscript on them for publication by the
bureau. Further, a number of Fox texts were translated and other
ethnological data obtained. Doctor Michelson returned to Washing-
ton near the close of September. He made another trip among the
Foxes in May and returned to Washington toward the end of June.
During this trip he obtained new data on Fox ceremonials.

By joint arrangement with the Museum of the American Indian,
Heye Foundation, the bureau undertook in the summer of 1923 the
excavation of the Burton Mound at Santa Barbara, Calif., which
was the chief village of the Santa Barbara Indians and without
question the most important archeological site on the southern Cali-
fornia coast. Mr. J. P. Harrington, ethnologist of the bureau, was
detailed to take charge of the exploration of the mound and the
work was commenced early in May, 1923, and continued throughout
the summer and fall. The first day’s work revealed the location of
the cemetery, just where old Indians had stated that it was situated.
During several months of careful stratigraphical excavation many
facts of interest for the prehistory of the Santa Barbara Indians
and the early culture of the Pacific coast in general were recorded.

The principal rancheria or village of the ancient Santa Barbara
Valley was not at the mission, where the Indians were later gathered,
but at the beach. It was situated just west of the mouth of Mis-
sion Creek, where a landing cove for canoes and two low mounds,
one by the beach and a larger one 650 feet inland and now known
as the Burton Mound, afforded unusual attraction as a dwelling
place for Indians. At a number of places in the locality were sul-
phur springs; also springs of good drinking water. The name of
the village was Syujtun, meaning “ where the trail splits.” There a
thriving population of some 500 Indians lived on the wild food
products of the neighboring shore and sea and of the Santa Barbara
Valley, rich in acorn-bearing oaks and game animals.

The inhabitants of Syujtun remained unmolested until the estab-
lishment of the Santa Barbara Mission in 1786. After this the native
villagers were gradually removed to the adobe cuarteles of the mis-
sion, 2 miles distant, and the desolated beach was known as “el
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 69

puerto de Santa Barbara” or as “el rancho de la playa.” After

the confiscation of the mission lands the ownership of the beach
ranch passed into private hands. During the forties the owner was
none other than Capt. George C. Nidever, known in California
history as the rescuer of the last surviving Indian woman from San
Nicolas Island. Captain Nidever sold the property in 1851 to
Augustus F. Hinchman, whose daughter, Miss Stella F. Hinchman,
has furnished valuable data about the history and traditions of the
mound. In 1860 Mr. Hinchman sold the tract in turn to Lewis T.
Burton, who made it his home for 19 years and after whom the
mound has been called in more recent times. None of the early
owners had allowed excavation on the property and with erection
of the Potter Hotel on top of the mound in 1901 all hope of
archeological investigation was lost. This hotel burned to the
ground on April 19, 1921, and the old village site was thereby again
released for archeological investigation.

The results of this excavation of the Indian town of Santa Bar-
bara proved rich and interesting beyond expectation. The graves
that were opened were crowded with human bodies, trinkets, and
a great variety of utensils. Among the rarest specimens are the
largest soapstone canoe ever discovered in California, a wooden awl
such as is described by the early historians, and a number of objects
of problematical use. There are soapstone pipes, fishhooks of
abalone and bone, sinker stones, arrowheads of great variety, spear-
heads, about 140 fine mortars, pestles, including some very long ones,
beads of many kinds, pendants, daggers, bowls and kettles of soap-
stone, including some of the largest ever found, native paints, etc.
About 300 skeletons were taken out, among them some very ancient
skeletons from the coquina or reef-rock layer. These are now in
the hands of Dr. Bruno Oetteking, of the Museum of the American
Indian, who is preparing an elaborate report on them.

At the close of January, Mr. Harrington returned to Washington
and has since then been engaged in the preparation of his report
on the Burton Mound.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, was engaged for the greater
part of the year in office work. This consisted chiefly in the his-
torical analysis of the large mass of material in native text
relating to the formation and structure and import of the League
er Confederation of the Five Iroquois Tribes or Nations. He was
also occupied in the translation of the farewell address of Degana-
wida, a founder of the confederation, into literary English. In
this address Deganawida briefly summarizes the scope and import
of the institutions and the laws of the league; herein, with the mas-
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

terful hand of a prophet-statesman, he also graphically recapitulated
the work accomplished by the several co-working founders.

Mr. Hewitt also translated from the Onondaga text the laws
first recognizing the extant institution of chieftainess in uterine
kindreds and then adopting it for the purpose of making it funda-
mental among the institutions of the League of the Iroquois, the laws
defining the duties, rights, and obligations of the incumbent of such
office and carefully prescribing the method by which a woman should
be nominated by the mothers of her own uterine kindred, the
method by which the choice should be confirmed, first by her own,
and then by sister, and then by cousin clans, and then finally how
this candidate should be installed at a federal council of condolence
and installation. These laws also prescribe the method by which
such chieftainess can, for cause, be deposed and a successor nomi-
nated and installed as prescribed by these laws; and they also pre-
scribe the method of nominating and installing the male aid to
the chieftainess, who must be a warrior and an orator to fulfill his
adjuvant duties.

As a member of the United States Geographic Board, representing
thereon the Bureau of American Ethnology, Smithsonian Insti-
tution, Mr. Hewitt has attended all regular and special meetings of
the board with a single exception. As custodian of manuscripts of
the Bureau of American Ethnology Mr. Hewitt reports that more
than 250 items were withdrawn and consulted by the various col-
laborators of the bureau and by other students.

In past years, in studying the social and political institutions of
the Iroquoian peoples, especially of the Five (latterly Six) Nations
or Tribes, Mr. Hewitt has spent a number of field seasons in carefully
collecting and recording in native texts from the best available
leaders, chieftains, chieftainesses, ritualists, and ceremonialists,
chiefly in the Mohawk, Onondaga, and Cayuga dialects, extensive
material and data concerning the principles, the laws, decrees and
ordinances of the instituting councils, the set rituals, the prescribed
chants, and the ceremonial addresses, which together defined the
functioning apparatus of the great commonwealth, commonly called
the League or Confederation of the Iroquois. Mr. Hewitt has under-
taken to subject, so far as possible, this text material to a careful
literary and historical] analysis and also to a thorough grammatic
and lexic criticism, in order to restore as far ‘as the evidence thus
secured will warrant, these rituals and chants and set addresses to
the earlier forms which were probably used when the League of the
Iroquois was instituted in the closing decades of the sixteenth cen-
tury. This work is necessarily tedious and slow but is of supreme
necessity. The results thus far are highly gratifying.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 71

In June, 1924, Mr. Hewitt visited the Six Nations of Iroquois
dwelling near Brantford, Ontario, Canada; the Onondaga dwelling
near Syracuse, N. Y.; the Tonawanda dwelling near Akron, N. Y.;
the Tuscarora dwelling near Sanborn, N. Y. His object on this trip
was to obtain a better knowledge of the music of the ritual chants
ot the Condolence and Installation Council. He also secured
quantity of purple wampum which is used in these league rituals
and which has now become so scarce that its cost is well-nigh pro-
hibitive.

Mr. Hewitt was also able to secure from the very few persons who
still retain some definite knowledge of the principles and _insti-
tutions of the league additional interpretative and confirmatory in-
formation concerning certain critical passages in the native texts
which he recorded in former field trips.

Mr. Francis La Flesche, ethnologist, gave most of his time to the
assembling of his notes on the child-naming rites and ceremonies
of the Osage Indians. These ancient rites, with their ceremonies, are
now practically obsolete, and it was fortunate that Mr. La Flesche
succeeded in securing two of the remaining versions. The first was
obtained from Wa-xthi’-zhi, a member of the I"-gtho”-ga or Puma
gens. This version will form the first part of the volume on this
subject.

The other version is that used by the Tsi’-zhu Wa-shta-ge, Peace-
maker, gens. It was with considerable difficulty obtained from old
Sho”’-ge-mo"-1", a member of the gens, who was very conservative
and opposed to having any of the tribal rites go to strangers. Since
the recording of these ancient rites that had been transmitted
through many generations, both these No*’-ho"-zhi"-ga, Wa-xthi’-zhi
and Sho”’-ge-mo?-i", have died, and it is now doubtful if any member
of the tribe could be found who is able to recite the rituals and go
through the ceremonial forms in their entirety.

Tsi’-zhu Wa-shta-ge version will form the second part of the
volume, now nearing completion, which is to be called “ Osage Child
Naming Rites.”

Mr. W. E. Myer, special archeologist, on his return from field work
in Tennessee, took up the preparation of his report on the remains
of the great prehistoric Indian settlement known as the Great Mound
Group in Cheatham County, Tenn., a preliminary account of which
was given in last year’s report. This town is situated on the Har-
peth River near Kingston Springs and is found in two clusters about
a mile apart in the bend of the Harpeth River, covering about 500
acres. The fortification of the Great Mound Group was one of the
finest prehistoric structures for defense made by the Indians of
Tennessee.
72 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Nearly all the lower river bend, called the “Mound Bottom” by
the local people, contains evidences of walls, many of which have
disappeared by long cultivation of the soil. Mr. Myer was not able
to determine the age of these mounds, but buildings which they
represent were undoubtedly destroyed before the coming of the
white people.

One of the most interesting results of the summer’s work was the
excavation of a small mound on the Denny farm at Goodlettsville,
Sumner County, Tenn., the relics from this mound showing that the
inhabitants of this site belonged to a culture quite unlike that of
much of the surrounding region in the valley of the Cumberland.

Mr. Myer also made studies in the southern part of Tennessee in
Lincoln and Moore Counties and made a map of a hitherto unde-
scribed mound group on Elk River.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

During the summer of 1923 Miss Frances Densmore visited the
Makah Indians at Neah Bay, Wash., and recorded their songs.
Neah Bay is near the end of Cape Flattery, but the coast is so
mountainous that it is reached only by boat. At the time of Miss
Densmore’s visit there was only one passenger boat a week to this
village. The principal industry of the Indians is salmon fishing.
The purpose of this trip was to observe the music of Indians who live
beside the ocean and to compare the music with that of tribes living
on the mountains, plains, and desert. As a result of the comparison
it was found that the music of the Makah resembles that of the Ute,
Papago, and Yuma more than it resembles that of the Chippewa,
Sioux, and Pawnee. This is general observation, the detailed com-
parison being unfinished. ‘Three instances are as follows: (1) The
Makah Indians use a “high drone,” or sustained tone held by two or
three women’s voices, while the others sing the melody. This was
heard among the Papago in southern Arizona and is found in certain
parts of Asia. This suggests a cultural evidence that the Indians
migrated from Asia and down the Pacific coast, the use of the drone
being more pronounced among the Makah than among the Papago;
(2) the Makah Indians have a considerable number of “ non-har-
monic ” songs to which the term “key ” can not properly be applied.
These were found in southern Arizona but not in the plains region ;
(3) the Makah songs concerning the whale are marked by a very
small compass and small intervals. The Ute songs concerning the
bear are also characterized by small intervals, but the compass is not
particularly small. The Makah songs recorded were of several
classes, including songs of the whale legends and whaling expedi-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 73

tions, songs of the potlatch and various social dances, songs con-
nected with contests of physical strength, “ gratitude songs,” which
were sung by individuals at feasts, lullabies for children, courting
songs, and the songs of wedding festivities.

Dances and gatherings of the tribe were attended ; numerous speci-
mens illustrating the culture of the people were collected ; the singers
and environment were photographed; and about 30 specimens of
plants were collected, with a description of their economic uses.

While in Washington, D. C., Miss Densmore arranged in a cata-
logue list 868 songs awaiting publication, and arranged in the
proper order for publication all her material on Pawnee, Papago,
Yuma, Cocopa, and Mohave music. Four manuscripts were sub-
mitted during the year, with the titles “Cocopa and Mohave Dance
Songs,” “Dance Songs and Flute Music of the Yuma,” “ Whaling
Songs, Dream Songs, and Legend Songs of the Makah,” and “ Pot-
latch Songs of the Makah.” These comprised, in addition to the
text, 87 songs, with phonograph records, musical transcriptions, and
analyses.

EDITORIAL WORK AND PUBLICATIONS

DISTRIBUTION OF PUBLICATIONS
The distribution of publications has been continued under the im-

mediate charge of Miss Helen Munroe, assisted by Miss Emma B.
Powers. Publications were distributed as follows:

As compared with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1923, there was
a decrease of 3,731 publications distributed, due to the fact that no
report volumes were issued during the year, whereas two reports
were published in the preceding fiscal year.

ILLUSTRATIONS

Mr. DeLancey Gill, illustrator, with the assistance of Mr. Albert
EK. Sweeney, continued the preparation of the illustrations of the
bureau. A summary of this work follows:

The work of reclassification of negatives has progressed satisfac-
torily. As a prelude to a new catalogue of the large collection of
negatives, this work will be of lasting value. About 4,000 negatives
were identified and rejacketed, but much yet remains to be done.

LIBRARY

The reference library continued under the immediate care of Miss
Ella Leary, librarian, assisted by Mr. Thomas Blackwell.

During the year 560 books were accessioned. Of these 82 were
acquired by purchase, 253 by gift and exchange, and 225 by binding
of periodicals. The current periodicals annually received number
about 975, of which 387 are by subscription, the remainder being
received through exchange. The library has also received 225 pam-
phlets. The aggregate number of books in the library at the close
of the year was 25,621, of pamphlets about 15,325.

During the year many students not connected with the Smith-
sonian Institution have applied to the library for books. The library
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 75

was used also by the Library of Congress and officers of the execu-
tive departments, and out of town students have made use of the
library through frequent loans.

Conditions of crowding on the book shelves are now acute in many
places in the stacks. Many volumes received by the library not per-
taining to anthropology were transferred to the library of the Smith-
sonian Institution.

COLLECTIONS

The following collections, purchased or acquired by members of
the bureau or by those detailed in connection with its researches,
have been transferred to the United States National Museum:

70367. Collection of about 90 specimens of picture pottery from the Mimbres
Valley, N. Mex.

APPENDIX 5
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES

Str: I have the honor to submit the report on the operations of the
International Exchange Service for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1924.

Congress appropriated $43,000 for the support of the service dur-
ing the year, $2,000 less than the previous appropriation. On the
basis of the previous year’s business this reduced amount would have
been sufficient for the needs of the service. Toward the middle of
the fiscal year, however, the exchanges had increased to such an
extent that it was necessary to send shipments to foreign countries
at less frequent intervals, in order to reduce the expense incurred
for freight, so as to avoid a deficit. Near the close of the year it was
found possible to return to the Institution’s practice of making ship-
ments to all foreign countries at intervals not exceeding a month.
In addition to the above amount, Congress appropriated for the ex-
changes $200 for printing and binding. The repayments from de-
-partmental and various other establishments aggregated $5,202.24,
making the total resources available for carrying on the system of
exchanges during the year $48,402.24.

The total number of packages passing through the service during
the year was 460,658, an increase over the number for the preceding
year of 82,832. The weight of these packages was 567,107 pounds,
an increase of 74,291. Much of this increase was due to the receipt
of a large number of publications from establishments in the United
States for transmission to the universities and colleges in Japan that
lost their libraries during the recent earthquake.

The publications sent and received by the Exchange Service are
classified under three heads: Parliamentary documents, depart-
mental documents, and miscellaneous scientific and literary publica-
tions. The term “parliamentary documents,” as here used, refers
to publications set aside by act of Congress for exchange with
foreign governments, and includes not only documents printed by
order of either House of Congress, but also copies of each publication
issued by any department, bureau, commission, or officer of the Gov-
ernment. Governments to which this class of publications are for-
warded send to this country in exchange copies of their own official

77
78

ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

documents for deposit in the Library of Congress. The term “ de-
partmental documents” embraces publications delivered at the In-
stitution by the various governmental departments, bureaus, or com-
missions for distribution to their correspondents abroad. Publica-
tions received in return are deposited in the various departmental
libraries. ‘Miscellaneous scientific and literary publications” are
received chiefly from learned societies, universities, colleges, scienti-
fic institutions, and museums in the United States for transmission
to similar establishments in all parts of the world.

The number and weight of the packages of different classes are
indicated in the following table:

As mentioned in previous reports, the disparity between the num-
ber of publications transmitted abroad and those received in return
is not as great as appears from the above figures. Packages sent
abroad contain in many instances only a single publication, while
those received in return often comprise several volumes. Further-
more, some foreign establishments send their publications directly
to their destinations in this country by mail instead of through
exchange channels.

During the year the State Department notified the Institution that
the Government of Hungary had adhered to the two exchange con-
ventions concluded at Brussels in 1886 and had established the
Hungarian Libraries Board at Budapest to carry out the provi-
sions of those conventions. The board was not fully established at
the close of the year, but will be ready to assume its duties as the
Hungarian Exchange Agency about October 1, 1924, when the
agency in Budapest conducted by the Institution for many years
will be discontinued. Dr. Julius Pikler, who has been the Smith-
sonian agent since July 1, 1906, has carried on the work to the entire
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 79

satisfaction of the Institution, and I desire to express here appre-
ciation of his faithful and efficient service during his connection with
this office.

The Institution was advised through diplomatic channels that the
Governments of the Dominican Republic, Hungary, Latvia, and the
Free City of Danzig had adhered to the two exchange conventions
concluded at Brussels March 15, 1886.

Toward the close of the fiscal year the librarian of the Storting
advised the Institution that the Norwegian depository of United
States official documents had been changed from the Stortingets
Bibliotek to the Universitets Bibliotek, Christiania.

The Japanese Association of the League of Nations submitted to
this country through the Embassy of Japan in Washington an ap-
peal for books for replenishing the libraries of Japanese universities
and colleges which were destroyed by the earthquake. The associa-
tion stated that that disaster wiped out huge collections of books
in many libraries, including the collection of 700,000 volumes in the
library of the Imperial University of Tokyo. The appeal was
heeded by many American establishments and thousands of publica-
tions were forwarded to the Smithsonian Institution for transmis-
sion to Japan through the International Exchange Service.

From time to time some of the establishments that make use of
the exchange service in the distribution of their publications abroad
add to their announcements a word of appreciation. During the
year a number of such gratifying expressions have been received,
particularly from the Argentine Republic, England, Germany, and
this country.

During the year 2,464 boxes were used in forwarding exchanges to
foreign agencies for distribution, being an increase of 241 over the
number for the preceding 12 months. Of the total number of boxes
sent abroad, 289 contained full sets of United States official docu-
ments for foreign depositories, and 2,175 included departmental
and other publications for depositories of partial sets and for other
correspondents. In addition to the packages sent abroad in boxes,
the exchange service mailed directly to their destinations during the
year about 40,000 packages. While it is the practice of the service to
send exchanges by freight to foreign agencies for distribution, quite
a number of packages are received for remote places which can not
well be reached through any of the agencies, and these packages are
forwarded by mail. Furthermore, owing to the high ocean freight
_ rates it often happens that it is cheaper to mail packages to some
countries than to pack them in boxes and ship them by freight.

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

In accordance with the terms of a convention concluded at Brus-
sels March 15, 1886, and under authority granted by Congress in
resolutions approved March 2, 1867, and March 2, 1901, 59 full sets
of United States official documents and 38 partial sets are now sent
through the Exchange Service regularly to depositories abroad. The
Ministry of Finance, Government of Northern Ireland, Belfast;
State Library, Reval, Esthonia; and the library of the League of
Nations, located at Geneva, Switzerland, have lately been added to
the list of those receiving full sets. The number of full and partial
sets of governmental documents forwarded to foreign depositories
is 97. The total number provided by law for this purpose and for
the Library of Congress is 100.

The convention concluded at Brussels in 1886 provided for the in-
ternational exchange of official documents and scientific and literary
publications. That convention was ratified by the United States,
Belgium, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, Serbia, Spain, and Switzerland.
Since the ratification of the Brussels convention a number of coun-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 81

tries have adhered thereto. The names of the countries, together
with the dates of their adherence, follow: Argentine Republic, 1889;
Paraguay, 1889; Uruguay, 1889 ; Poland,'1920; Czechoslovakia,’'1921 ;
Rumania, 1923; Dominican Republic, 1923; Hungary, 1923; and
Danzig, 1924.

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the oper-
ations of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1924:

The appropriation made by Congress for the regular maintenance
of the park was the same as for the preceding year, $125,000. The
bill providing for printing and binding, Smithsonian Institution,
contained an additional allotment of $300 for the National Zoologi-
cal Park.

The year has been one of the most successful in the history of the
park, both as to care and maintenance of the buildings, grounds,
and collections, and in service to the public. In addition to many
minor improvements, a new restaurant building has been completed.
This was in operation before the close of the year; and the cleanly,
roomy, open refreshment room and sanitary serving quarters have
been greatly appreciated by visitors. The collection is beyond doubt
of far greater value and scientific interest than ever before, and has
been kept in excellent condition, with low rate of loss. All previous
attendance records have been broken, and a total of 2,442,880 visitors
was recorded for the year.

ACCESSIONS

Gifts.—Altogether, 221 animals were presented to the park, or
placed on indefinite deposit, during the year. A most notable acces-
sion was a fine young Baird’s tapir, presented by Mr. M. G. Henery,
of Puerto Castillo, Honduras, and obtained through the interest of
Dr. Wm. M. Mann. Baird’s tapir has always been one of the rarest
animals in captivity and the only specimen ever before in the Na-
tional Zoological Park was a young animal exhibited for a short

time 24 years ago. Three species of tapirs are now living in the
_ park, a most unusual record for any zoological garden. Mr. Henery
is to be congratulated on his notable achievement in adding this
unusual animal to the national collections.

Mr. Victor J. Evans, of Washington, D. C., who has taken a great
interest in the National Zoological Park for many years, continued
his contributions of carefully selected animals of the rarer and more
87

88 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

unusual varieties. Among the specimens received from him during
the last year were such valuable species as the agile gibbon, gelada
baboon, Tasmanian devil, crimson-winged paroquet, Australian cat-
bird, and long-necked turtle. Altogether, Mr. Evans contributed 55
animals to the park during the year.

A most interesting collection from Brazil was brought to the park
by Dr. W. L. Schurz, commercial attaché, United States Embassy,
Rio de Janeiro. This collection included a fine South American bush
dog (Icticyon venaticus) , the first of its kind to be exhibited in the
park. There were also an ocelot, capybara, coatimundi, and several
birds. The bush dog is an exceedingly rare species in collections.

The Canadian Government, through Hon. J. B. Harkin, Commis-
sioner of Dominion Parks, presented a male yak and two female
Rocky Mountain sheep from Banff, Alberta; and the State Fish and
Game Commission of Utah, through Hon. D. H. Madsen, contributed
four beavers and a notable collection of wild ducks, including six
different species.

Births —During the year 42 mammals were born and 27 birds
were hatched in the park. These records, as in former reports, in-
clude only such as are reared to a reasonable age, no account being
made in these published statistics of young that live only a few days.
Mammals born include: Mexican puma, 2; lion, 2; dingo, 2; gray
wolf, 6; Rocky Mountain sheep, 1; mouflon, 1; aoudad, 1; tahr, 2;
American bison, 2; reindeer, 2; Japanese deer, 3; hog deer, 2; fallow
deer, 2; red deer, 5; guanaco, 1; Trinidad agouti, 3; rhesus monkey,
1; Javan macaque, 1; red kangaroo, 1; rufous-bellied wallaby, 1;
brush-tailed rock wallaby, 1. Birds hatched were of the following
species: Blue goose, black duck, wood duck, Australian ibis, black-
crowned night heron, and grass paroquet.

Twin monkeys were born for the first time in the records of the
park, but one of the young lived only a few days. The species was
Macaca rhesus. The breeding of the blue goose (Chen cerulescens)
is a notable achievement, of which the keepers in the bird division
may well be proud. The young of this bird have never before been
reared, and only once before, so far as is known, has the species
nested in captivity.

Eachanges.—A number of desirable animals were received in ex-
change for surplus stock. These included 12 mammals, 60 birds,
and 4 reptiles. Among the especially noteworthy accessions in this
class are a young black rhinoceros and a leopard from Africa, 5
reindeer from Norway, and 2 San Geronimo harbor seals from
Lower California. Birds received in exchange include a kiwi (Ap-
teryx mantelli), which, with a number of other rare species, came
from the Wellington, New Zealand, Zoological Gardens in exchange
for some American animals. There were also received in exchange
a trumpeter swan, a wedge-tailed eagle, and numbers of other water-
fowl and cage birds.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 91

Purchases.—Only 9 mammals, 81 birds, and 8 reptiles were pur-
chased during the year. Special mention should be made, however,
of a pair of Alpine ibex, from Europe, 10 Marquesas Islands doves,
2 bleeding-heart doves, 12 white-cheeked geese, 2 pink-footed geese,
2 Massena quail, and a gannet. All of these unusual species are
doing well in the park. ‘

Transfers.—The Biological Survey, United States Department of
Agriculture, transferred to the National Zoological Park a number
of especially desirable animals taken by field agents of the bureau or
seized by United States game wardens in discharge of their duties.
Of particular interest during the year were a black bear from Oregon,
2 pacas from Central America, a black-footed ferret from Nebraska,
2 white-cheeked geese from Alaska, 2 whistling and 2 mute swans.
Altogether, the Biological Survey contributed 7 mammals and 11
birds during the year.

Deposits—Among the few animals received on deposit are two
parrots rarely shown in this country. These are the Philippine
cockatoo and the Philippine green parrot, both new to the records

of the park.

REMOVALS

There were sent away in exchange to other zoological gardens
during the year, 75 surplus animals, including 41 mammals, 31
birds, and 3 reptiles. Among these were the following mammals
born and reared in the park: European brown bear, 3; raccoon, 4;
llama, 1; tahr, 1; yak, 2; Japanese deer, 9; red kangaroo, 1; rufous-
bellied wallaby, 3. In addition to these, 26 gray squirrels were sent
to Quantico, Va., for stocking the United States Marine Corps reser-
vation at that place, and 21 squirrels were sent to the military reser-
vation at Fort Hayes, Columbus, Ohio.

A number of animals on deposit were returned to owners.

Although the death rate has been held at a normally low mark,
there have been, as in all years, a few serious losses of animals.
Some records of interest because of the long periods of life in the
park are as follows: A sacred ibis (Threskiornis wthiopicus) re-
ceived September 25, 1903, died October 20, 1928, after 20 years and
25 days in the collection. An East African leopard, female, which
was presented to the park by Mr. W. N. McMillan, and arrived in
Washington December 19, 1909, died 14 years and 4 days later on
December 23, 1923. A boatbill heron (Cochlearius cochlearius) re-
ceived September 28, 1910, died on December 11, 1923, after 138
years 2 months and 13 days in the park. A female Mexican agouti
(Dasyprocta mexicana) received July 7, 1910, died August 28, 1923,
having lived in the park for 13 years 1 month and 21 days. A
female American elk (Cervus canadensis) born in the park on June
5, 1910, died August 10, 1923, at an age of 13 years 2 months and 5
days. A northern wild cat (Lynw vinta), male, received January 15,
1912, died 11 years 9 months and 18 days later, on October 28, 192s.
A male white stork (Ciconia ciconia) received August 12, 1912, died
April 26, 1924, after 11 years 8 months and 5 days in the park.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 93

A femafe tayra (Z'ayra barbara) received September 8, 1914, died
on March 20, 1924, from pericarditis, after a life of 9 years 6 months
and 12 days in the collection.

Other serious losses by death during the year were a Malay sun
bear, congestion of lungs, August 12, 1923; agile gibbon, pneumonia,
January 11, 1924; orang-utan, late rickets, February 15, 1924; and a
South American tapir, intussusception of small intestine, February
19, 1924.

Post-mortem examinations were made in most cases by the patho-
logical division of the Bureau of Animal Industry; but five examina-
tions were made by Dr. Adolph H. Schultz, of the Carnegie Institu-
tion, Laboratory of Embryology; and one was made at St. Eliza-
beths Hospital, Department of the Interior.

The following list shows the results of autopsies, the cases being
arranged by groups:

VISITORS

Attendance records exceeded the previous year (1923) by 49,452
and were 42,043 over the record year for the park (1921). ‘The
total number of visitors, as determined by count and estimate, was
2,449,880. This makes the fifth year in succession that the attend-
ance has exceeded two millions. The greatest attendance in any one
month was 352,425 in September, 1923.

IMPROVEMENTS

Work on the new paddocks for hoofed animals near the Connecti-
cut Avenue entrance, described fully in the last report, was finished
early in the year, and the 11 yards thus provided were all occupied
by animals in the fail. The superior arrangement of these paddocks
for the care and exhibition of the animals has been very favorably
commented upon by officials from other zoological gardens, and the
pleasing sight of herds of animals in such large inclosures is greatly
admired by visitors.

In late winter the birds were all removed from the North Ameri-
can waterfowl! lake and early in the spring the lake was thoroughly
cleaned of silt. The work was completed so that the waterfowl were
returned before the season for nesting. The sewer from the office
and stables was extended to connect with the Rock Creek intercept-
ing sewer. A new sidewalk on the east side of the road opposite
the restaurant building was completed, and roads, walks, and bridle
paths throughout the park were repaired. Two old boilers in the
central heating plant were replaced with new boilers of improved
pattern, thus considerably increasing the heating capacity of the
plant.

The usual repairs to roofs, gutters and downspouts, fences, and
cages were made and much of the ironwork was painted. The old
metal awning frames over the walk around the bear cages were
removed, since these unsightly frames were no longer needed, the
trees now providing ample shade. Work was begun on the ware-
house for new or surplus animals, approved in the last plan of opera-
tions. This long-needed structure will be completed in the present
year.

The most important improvement of the year has been the com-
plete reconstruction of the central refreshment building. The old
restaurant was found to be in such bad condition that very little of
the material in it could be used, and in order to provide the new
structure with suitable foundations it was almost entirely wrecked.
The new restaurant is built chiefly of chestnut timbers salvaged
102 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

from the dead trees in the reservation, and adds greatly to the ap-
pearance of the park. It was leased to a competent restaurant man,
who opened it to the public in April.

IMPORTANT NEEDS

Exhibition building for birds—The outstanding need of the: park
is a new building for exhibition of birds. As pointed out in previous
reports, the old bird house was built as a temporary structure many
years ago, and is now not only in bad condition and virtually beyond
repair but is so small that only a part of the valuable collection of
birds can be exhibited at one time. The public space is, furthermore,
entirely too restricted for present-day crowds of visitors. The col-
lection of birds is growing in importance and value year by year,
as rare and unusual specimens from all parts of the world are pre-
sented to the Government zoological gardens. Public interest in the
bird collection is very great, as attested by the throngs of visitors
that fill the old bird house, and it is greatly to be hoped that a new
building may soon be provided for the proper care and exhibition
of the birds and for the accommodation of the constantly increasing _
number of visitors who wish to see them to advantage.

Funds for purchase of animals—Although the National Zoo-
logical Park receives numerous animals each year as gifts or in
exchange for surplus stock reared in the park, sufficient funds
have never been available for the purchase of rare and unusual
species offered for sale from time to time. A representative or
well-balanced collection of the living animals of the world can be
built up and maintained only by the purchase of certain types of
animals not otherwise obtainable, and opportunities to secure these
desiderata must be taken up promptly if the animals are to be
obtained. Animals greatly needed to fill definite gaps in the col-
lection are offered for sale from time to time, but the park is most
often unable to purchase them for lack of funds. In addition to
increased appropriations to cover cost and transportation of ani-
mals, it is suggested that a fund, to be deposited with the Smith-
sonian Institution and held for the purchase of animals for the
National Zoological Park, be inaugurated. This fund might be
increased by gift or bequest, and could be regularly maintained by
an act of Congress authorizing deposit in it of certain miscellaneous
revenues of the park now turned into the general fund of the
Treasury, these including rent of refreshment stands, restaurant,
and other similar concessions.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 7

REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Sm: The Astrophysical Observatory was conducted under the fol-
lowing passage of the independent offices appropriation act approved
February 138, 1923:

Astrophysical Observatory: For maintenance of the Astrophysical Observa-
tory, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including assistants,
purchase of necessary books and periodicals, apparatus, making necessary
observations in high altitudes, repairs and alterations of buildings, and miscel-
laneous expenses, $15,500.

The observatory occupies a number of frame structures within an
inclosure of about 16,000 square feet south of the Smithsonian ad-
ministration building at Washington, and also a cement observing
station and frame cottage for observers on a plot of 10,000 square
feet leased from the Carnegie Solar Observatory on Mount Wilson,
Calif. :

A new solar observing station on Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., was
erected in July, 1920, at the expense of funds donated for the pur-
pose by Mr. John A. Roebling, of Bernardsville, N. J., and this sta-
tion has been occupied as a solar radiation observing station by the
Astrophysical Observatory since October, 1920.

The present value of the buildings and equipment for the Astro-
physical Observatory owned by the Government is estimated at
$50,000. This estimate contemplates the cost required to replace the
outiit for the purposes of the investigation.

WORK OF THE YEAR

There have been several features of particular interest, including
the installation of daily telegraphic reports from the Arizona and
Chile solar-radiation stations, certain experimental forecasts based
on these reports, and the measurement of the energy distribution in
the spectra of 10 of the brighter stars.

Work at Washington.—As in previous years, the variation of the
sun has been the main concern. The generosity of Mr. John A.
Roebling enabled arrangements to be made for daily telegrams from
our two solar radiation stations. This service was begun September
13, 1923. The results obtained in Chile are cabled in code, so that the
weighted mean solar-constant value, the date and hour of observa-

° 103
104 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

tion, and its grade are all included in two words. Messages arrive
at Washington from both stations within 24 hours of the actual
measurements, and generally represent mean results of five inde-
pendent determinations at each station. Arrangements have been
made (also owing to Mr. Roebling’s interest and generosity) to test
the value of the solar measurements for forecasting according to the
methods of Mr. H. H. Clayton. For this purpose Mr. Clayton has
had a small office and one assistant near his home in Canton, Mass.,
where he receives before noon daily from the Smithsonian Institu-
tion the weighted mean of the solar-constant values observed in
Arizona and Chile on the preceding day. He makes his forecasts for
3, 4, 5, and 27 days in advance, and mails them to the Institution on
the same afternoon. Thus we receive the forecasts sufficiently long
before their maturity to make a very real and searching test of their
validity.

These forecasts for definite days relate to the mean temperature of
New York City, and are later on compared with the observed tem-
peratures and analyzed by several purely mathematical methods
quite independently of any bias of the computer. The official
weather services of the various countries do not, of course, make
predictions parallel to these, except in Argentina, where such fore-
casts are made by similar methods to Clayton’s. Hence it is impos-
sible to know at present how much gain, if any, Mr. Clayton’s solar
forecasts show over the present official methods. That they do show
some prevision of the event, even to five days after the solar observa-
tions, is certain.

Hitherto, however, the 27-day detailed forecasts have shown no
correlation with the New York temperatures. This is not at all
surprising. Indeed, all such forecasts have to contend against great
odds. For we recall that the march of temperature often goes
quickly from crest to trough, so that even if a true forecast could
be made, and it should be no more than 12 or 24 hours off in point of
time, there would be large divergences between the prediction and
the event. With the unyielding mathematical methods of verifica-
tion this would greatly diminish the correlation found.

A fairer test for very long-range forecasts is found in general
statements as to the expected departure from mean normal tem-
peratures for coming months. These Mr. Clayton has furnished
from 15 to 30 days before the beginning of each month from De-
cember, 1923, to the present time. He also furnishes similar pre-
dictions about the approaching weeks furnished three days before
the beginning of the week in question. With few exceptions, these
broader prognostications have been fairly verified.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 105

On the whole, therefore, although the results are as yet far from
being entirely satisfying, these experimental forecasts of Mr. Clay-
ton’s are promising enough to warrant further trial. New methods
are continually being devised and tried in making them. Mr. Roe-
bling has generously arranged to continue them until June 30, 1925.
As the work is purely experimental no detailed publication of it will
be made at present.

Naturally, if the forecasts made by Mr. Clayton really represent
solar changes, he can not succeed unless good solar measurements
are supplied. As soon as we began to receive daily telegrams from
both stations occasional fairly wide disagreements of individual days
commanded attention. We felt it necessary, in studying the causes
of such disagreements, to revise again entirely the systems of little
corrections to solar-constant values which have to be made to allow
for the haziness and humidity of our atmosphere. This revision
could be made with more advantage because much additional data
had meanwhile accumulated.

Mr. Fowle and Mrs. Bond have worked over this matter during
practically their entire time, which, however, owing to furlough,
was only about three months in Mrs. Bond’s case. A new method of
determining these corrections has been devised by the director and
Mr. Fowle, which eliminates satisfactorily the influence of the solar
changes which have occurred. Hitherto this matter of solar change
superposed upon the small terrestrial sources of error which we de-
sire to eliminate has been very embarrassing. Of course, if one
could wait many years before proceeding to evaluate the terrestrial
effects, the solar changes, being independent or but loosely connected
with local terrestrial ones, would be eliminated in the mean of a mass
of observations. We can, indeed, after several years more of observ-
ing, finally proceed in this way. But wishing to make immediate
use of our results a new method of procedure has fortunately oc-
curred to us which permits us to avoid the interference of solar
changes altogether. The details will-be published soon.

As both to us and to the Chief of the Weather Bureau it seemed
unwise to publish preliminary values of the solar constant which
later on would have to be corrected, we have discontinued the fre-
quent publications of them in the Monthly Weather Review which
we have been accustomed to make for several years past. After we
come to a fully satisfactory basis of systematic atmospheric correc-
tions, these publications may be resumed.

Of the two solar-radiation stations, Montezuma, Chile, has proved
far more suitable to the purpose than Harqua Hala, Ariz. It seems
probable that a place somewhat farther west and decidedly higher
would be preferable to Mount Harqua Hala. Violent storms occur
there in various months of the year, and the summer months in par.
106 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

ticular have proved very unsatisfactory. If financial means were
available it would be highly desirable to remove the station to
another site, and, indeed, a better one is already selected which
would present many advantages. The cost of removal would be
about $7,000.

The systematic revision of results in the hands of Mr. Fowle and
Mrs. Bond has led to much improvement, as shown by the close
accord of daily solar-constant values at the two stations. For the
period September, 1922, to March, 1924, the average daily difference
is less than 0.5 per cent. In the month of October, 1923, when the
weather was fine at both stations almost every day, it ran as low as
0.2 per cent.

The solar-constant values have continued almost without excep-
tion below normal. From March, 1922, until June, 1924, the mean
result for every single month was below the normal value, which is
1.938 calories per square centimeter per minute. This long-continucd
defect of solar radiation may well have produced interesting climatic
effects. It is interesting to report in this connection a letter from
M. Antoniadi, of France, stating that the polar cap of Mars is larger
than it has been under parallel conditions for 70 years, and asking if
the solar-radiation measurements showed anything unusual. Nat-
urally decreased solar radiation would tend to produce that effect.

A letter from the eminent meteorologist, Doctor Bjerknes, of
Norway, to Doctor Hale, of the Mount Wilson Observatory, hus
been referred to us, and with permission of the author is here copied
in part as an indication of expert appreciation of our work:

’ I have been greatly interested in the establishment of a complete “ cir-
cumpolar ” weather service, as this only will give the full view of the changing
states of the atmosphere. This circumpolar service is now beginning to become
a reality. The charts may soon more or less cover the entire northern
hemisphere.

But then another idea arises by itself, namely, to bring these more and more
complete pictures of the varying states of our atmosphere into connection with
their ultimate cause, the solar activity, 211th

I am aware that the solar constant is determined every day at Mount Wilson
Solar Observatory, and at the Calama Observatory of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution. * * * JI think it would now be of high importance to every day
have the most recent value of the solar constant incorporated in the daily
meteorological issue.

If this should be practicable, the value of the data which are every day at
the disposal of the meteorologist would increase enormously. It is, of course,
dangerous to prophesy. But a new era may perhaps begin for meteorology
from the moment when the meteorologist has at his disposal every day com-
plete data both for the sun’s activity and for the state of the atmosphere over
an entire hemisphere of the earth.

Work at the two solar-radiation stations—The results just dis-
cussed are, of course, the fruit of the zealous work of our observers in

Arizona and Chile. Mount Harqua Hala continues under the direc-
tion of Mr. A. F. Moore, who was assisted until March 1, 1924, by
Mr. P. E. Greeley. After Mr. Greeley’s resignation, Mr. A. H. Wor-
thing assisted from May 20 to June 30, but then resigned. At
Montezuma, Chile, the station continued in charge of Mr. L. B.
Aldrich, assisted by Mr. F. A. Greeley.

Many comforts and observing improvements have been added at
both stations at small expense owing to the ingenuity and hard
manual labor of the observers. At both stations all possible days for
solar-constant work have been utilized, and with very high accuracy
of observation. About 75 per cent of all days were observed in
Arizona and above 80 per cent. in Chile. The months of July,
August, and September, however, were very unfavorable at Harqua
Hala, because of unusual cloudiness which prevailed all over that
section of the United States. This abnormal state of the sky was
indeed made specially prominent by the almost complete failure
of all the California observations of the total solar eclipse of Sep-
tember 10, 1923. Many observations of these months must be
rejected on account of unfavorable sky.

Mr. W. H. Hoover assisted Mr. Moore for a few weeks in May,
1923. While Mr. and Mrs. Moore were away in Australia setting
up near Sydney a solar-radiation outfit ordered by Rev. E. F.
Pigot, of Riverview College, for a committee of interested Aus-
tralians, Mr. and Mrs. Hoover relieved them at Harqua Hala from
July until September. Mr. Hoover was thus prepared by actual
field experience to be director of the Argentine Government’s new
solar-radiation station at La Quiaca.

The outfit for this station was prepared at the Smithsonian In-
stitution after designs of the writer, and the finer parts, such as
those of the bolometer and galvanometer, were constructed by Mr.
Hoover. Shipment was made in January, 1924, and the station at
La Quiaca made ready for solar observing in June, 1924. Thus the
Argentine Government is the first agency outside the Smithsonian
Institution to undertake regular determinations of the variation of
the sun. Their official weather service still receives daily telegraphic
reports from our station at Montezuma, Chile, and it will supple-
ment these by its own solar-radiation measurements at La Quiaca.

Field work at Mount Wilson—The director and Mrs. Abbot occu-
pied this station from July to October, 1923. Three objects were in
view—First, to set up apparatus and begin observations on the varia-
tions of atmospheric ozone after the ingenious spectroscopic method
of Fabry and Buisson. M. Fabry was so kind as to supervise the
ordering in Paris of all the special quartz and fluorite optical parts
needed. Owing to the detached service of the Smithsonian instru-
108 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

ment maker, Mr. Kramer, who was engaged in making the Aus-
tralian and Argentine solar radiation outfits, no work had been done
toward mounting the optical parts for ozone studies or, indeed, to-
ward preparing for other experiments of the expedition. So it hap-
pened that the director spent several weeks on Mount Wilson at
instrument making and was not quite ready to begin the ozone ob-
servations in 1923.

The second object was to test new improvements on the solar
cooker. By the lively interest of Director Stratton, the Bureau of
Standards had constructed by their skillful glass blower, Mr. Sperl-
ing, a long, pyrex-glass, double-walled vacuum tube to inclose the
heater tube of the Mount Wilson solar cooker. As stated in Volume
IV of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, nearly nine-
tenths of the loss of heat had hitherto occurred from the heater tube
within the great mirror. It was to check this loss that the new
device was planned. :

Unfortunately, the aluminum of the mirror was found much de-
teriorated and could not be fully restored by polishing. Hence the
mirror was very inefficient in 1923. Nevertheless, the vacuum tube
showed its efficiency by the fact of the heating of the oven to 175° C.,
or fully 25° C. above the usual maximum temperatures of 1920.
But new troubles arose. The oil circulation became leaky at the new
high temperature, spontaneous combustion of the cotton heat insu-
lation occurred, and the experiments had to be stopped after long-
continued vain attempts to close the leaks by soldering. Also the
vacuum tube, which was really made too long for safety, soon broke
under the unequal heating strains. After this breakage occurred
the maximum temperatures attained were but 120° C., showing that
over 50° C. of advantage came from the employment of the vacuum
device. The experiments seemed so promising that a continuation
of them was arranged for 1924, and new and improved instrumental
constructions were prepared by Mr. Kramer during the winter
months

The third piece of work attempted was with the 100-inch tele-
scope on the energy spectrum of the brighter stars. Messrs. Abbot
and Aldrich had, indeed, done this with moderate success in 1922,
employing the vacuum bolometer and galvanometer. But great
trouble had been found in the use of those instruments at extreme
sensibility. Fortunately, the late Dr. FE. F. Nichols had offered to
have prepared a radiometer of improved design for the work. This
instrument, constructed by Dr. J. D. Tear, proved equally as sensitive
as the bolometer used in 1922, and practically as easy to use as a
meter stick.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 109

~

With it and with a new optical arrangement designed by the
writer, and largely constructed by him, very interesting results were
obtained. The spectra of 10 stars, including the sun, as cast by a
60° flint-glass prism, were measured successfully. As the sun’s energy
spectrum is well known, it was possible to eliminate by comparison
with it all of the chief instrumental and atmospheric losses. Thus
the results appear as stellar energy curves outside our atmosphere,
expressed on the normal or wave-length scale. As the deflections
observed were fairly large, no less than 50 millimeters at maximum
in the spectrum of Betelgeuse, for example, the curves are of very
fair accuracy over most of their extent. It was possible to improve
them in the shorter wave-length region where they were inaccurate
by: employing visual and photographic results of German observers.
Thus the whole of the intense part of the spectrum of the yellow
and red stars and a large part of that of the white and blue ones
were well delineated. From these results good estimates could be
made of the star temperatures on the “ black-body ” basis. Further-
more, estimates of the diameters necessary in “ black bodies” to pro-
duce at those temperatures the observed amounts of energy were
made. It is gratifying to find these results on stellar diameters as
accordant as could be expected with those of Pease made by means
of Michelson’s method of the interferometer. A summary follows:

SUMMARY

The year has been notable for the establishment of daily tele-
graphic solar-constant intejligence from Montezuma, Chile, and
Harqua Hala, Ariz., through the interest and generosity of Mr. John
A. Roebling. Also, due to the same support, experimental tempera-
ture forecasts for New York City, based on these daily reports of
110 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

solar changes, have been regularly submitted by Mr. H. H. Clayton
for certain periods of time in advance. Revision of the solar radia-
tion results of the two stations shows average daily accord to less
than 0.5 per cent in their solar-constant determinations. Observa-
tions have been received from one or both solar-radiation stations
on about 90 per cent of all days. Further experiments with the solar
cooker have resulted in some advancement and have pointed the way
to further progress. Apparatus has been made ready for determina-
tions of atmospheric ozone after the method of Fabry and Buisson.
Highly interesting results on stellar energy spectrum distribution and
on star diameters have been obtained with a Nichols radiometer in co-
operation with the Mount Wilson Observatory of the Carnegie Insti-
tution.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the United States Regional Bureau of the International
Catalogue of Scientific Literature for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1924.

As has been stated in several previous annual reports, political and
financial conditions in Europe, caused by the late war, forced a
suspension of the printing and publishing of the International Cata-
logue after the fourteenth annual issue had been completed in July,
1921. <A total of 240 volumes had been published up to the
time that printing was suspended. This series of publications con-
stitutes a classified index catalogue of the scientific literature of
the world for 14 years, from 1901 to 1914, inclusive, and furnishes
the only example of such work ever published. In spite of numer-
ous attempts to resume publication it has been found impossible
to do so in the face of the continued unsettled condition of inter-
national monetary standards. The continued high price of materials
and labor entering into publishing expenses brings the cost of the
10,000 pages of each annual issue of the catalogue up to impossible
figures when expressed in terms of the depreciated currency of many
of the cooperating countries.

In 1922, finding that immediate resumption of publication was
impossible, an international convention was held in Brussels to con-
sider means whereby the organization could be held intact. A
resolution to this end was suggested by this regional bureau and
was unanimously agreed to. The resolution was:

‘That the convention is of opinion that the international organization should
be kept in being through mutual agreement to continue as far as possible the
work of the regional bureaus until such time as it may be economically pos-
sible to resume publication.

The other countries represented at this convention, as well as
the United States, have since that time lived up to the spirit of this
resolution.

The present aim of this bureau is to collect and record the data
necessary to index the current scientific publications of the United
States without attempting to classify the subjects of the papers
themselves, for before publication is resumed it will be necessary
to completely revise the classification schedules heretofore used in
order to keep abreast with ever advancing scientific discoveries and

11]
112 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924
the consequently changing requirements of investigators and
students.

The need of a definite, concrete, and internationally satisfactory
plan of operation to govern any organization undertaking to index
and classify current scientific literature is now more evident than it
wag 24 years ago when the International Catalogue was founded, for
since the publication of the catalogue by this organization was sus-
pended many plans have been suggested but none have so far been
found satisfactory or practical. Schemes which take into consid-
eration only local or special needs are found useless when world-wide
needs are considered. And when such schemes are compared with
the far-reaching, time-tried, and officially recognized organization
of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, whose scope
embraces all scientific subjects and whose field is world-wide, their
inadequacy is at once apparent.

In aiming to meet the various needs of scientific specialists and
students several forms of service are required:

i. Immediate notices which may be furnished by means of cards
or assembled reference data to meet the requirements of specialists
in restricted fields.

9. Monthly or quarterly classified records furnishing not only
complete index data but also, to meet the needs of general students
as well as specialists, brief abstracts of the subject contents of each
paper noted.

3. Yearly catalogues or yearbooks, each covering a recognized sub-
division of science, collectively furnishing a permanent, assembled,
classified record of all scientific activities. Such collective records
are the only ones suited to meet the needs and requirements of libra-
rians as well as future investigators.

As in the preparation of each of these aids to scientific investi-
eation the same materials are required and the same methods of
indexing and classifying are employed, it is evident that consolida-
tion, or at least close cooperation, should exist between all organiza-
tions undertaking such work.

Many abstracting agencies now exist and attempts are being made
to establish more, but taken collectively they fail to cover all
branches of science and are too dissimilar in their methods and form
of publication to take the place of a concise, classified, permanent
record of scientific publications so urgently needed by specialists
and librarians alike. It was chiefly to meet this need that the Inter-
national Catalogue was originally founded.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the library of the Smithsonian Institution and of the libraries
of the bureaus under its administration for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1924.

The use of the library by members of the Smithsonian staff has
been stimulated by the publication each fortnight in Smithsonian
Local Notes of principal additions to the collections and by the daily
circulation among heads of scientific departments and divisions of
a typewritten list of original articles appearing in periodicals re-
ceived for the main brary.

While the libraries administered under the Smithsonian Institu-
tion are used principally for reference in connection with advanced —
scientific and technological research and special administrative prob-
lems, their facilities are open to all. Every book is available to the
public, through consultation, by borrowing through an accredited
library, or by means of photographic reproduction at the corre-
spondent’s expense.

SMITHSONIAN MAIN LIBRARY

The number of publications received for the main library was
8,678, consisting of 4,044 volumes, 2,126 parts, 2,332 pamphlets,
and 176 charts. The total number of accessions has reached 544,-
980, representing 901,985 publications.

Theses and academic publications were received from abroad
from universities located at the following places: Algiers, Berlin,
Bern, Copenhagen, Dijon, Dorpat, Freiburg, Giessen, Graz, Halle,
Kiel, Konigsberg, Liége, London, Lund, Manchester, Marburg,
Montpellier, Paris, Prague, Rennes, Strasbourg, Tokyo, Utrecht,
Vienna, Warsaw, Wilno, and Ziirich.

Of a total of 3,352 missing parts of incomplete sets requested in
exchange, 1,786 were secured, a percentage of 53.2 as compared
with 43.2 last year.

SMITHSONIAN OFFICE LIBRARY

The loans from the office library were 2,749. The number of
volumes catalogued was 5,348. The number of new titles added to

the author catalogue was 1,125.
113
114 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

The gift of Dr. F. W. Clarke of 170 pamphlets, in continuation
of his collection of papers on the atomic weights, brought the total
number of publications accessioned up to 477.

There were 51 additions to the aeronautical collection. The
growth of this collection during the past decade has been due almost
entirely to the personal efforts of Mr. Paul Brockett, who has secured
for it many rare and valuable works, the acquisition of which would
otherwise have entailed great expense.

The cataloguing of the European Historical Series of the Watts
de Peyster collection is approaching completion.

UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

The library of the National Museum now contains 63,691 volumes
and 101,057 pamphlets, making a total of 164,748 publications. Of
these 1,521 volumes and 2,667 pamphlets represent the increase of
the year; 14,528 parts of periodicals were entered. Owing to lack
of funds, only 163 books were bound.

The number of loans reached a total of 10,577. Many more vol-
umes were consulted without being taken out. There were borrowed
1,929 books from the Library of Congress and 130 from other
libraries.

When it is realized that 6,189 of the library’s loans were made to
the sectional libraries, the importance of the latter will become
readily apparent. The sectional libraries maintained are as follows:

Administration. Mechanical technology.
American archeology. Medicine.

Anthropology. Minerals.

Birds. Mineral technology.
Botany. Mollusks..

Nehinoderms. Old World archeology.
Editor’s office. Paleobotany.

Ethnology. Photography.

Fishes. Physical anthropology.
Foods. Property clerk’s office.
Geology. Reptiles and batrachians.
Graphic arts. Superintendent’s office.
History. Taxidermy.

Insects. Textiles.

Invertebrate paleontology. Vertebrate paleontology.
Mammals. War library.

Marine invertebrates. Wood technology.

The sectional libraries are under the immediate custody of mem-
bers of the administrative and scientific staffs, to whom the Museum
is also indebted for many valuable gifts to the library and timely
suggestions for the increase of its collections in the fields listed
above. Among the donors for the present year should be men-
tioned Messrs. Paul Bartsch, R. S. Bassler, J. E. Benedict, A. G.

B. H. Swales, and Charles D. Walcott. The gifts of Doctor Dall
to the sectional library of mollusks numbered 167 titles. Through
the efforts of Doctor Bassler, the Museum has been fortunate in
securing the library of the late Edgar E. Teller, paleontologist, of
Buffalo, N. Y. The books were received shortly before the close
of the fiscal year.

The number of cards added to the subject catalogue was 2,810.

OTHER BRANCH LIBRARIES

The branch libraries at the Astrophysical Observatory, the Na-
tional Zoological Park, the National Gallery of Art, and the Freer
Gallery of Art received a number of accessions during the year.
The activities of the library of the Bureau of American Ethnology
are covered in the report of the chief of that bureau.

SUMMARY OF RECEIPTS AND ACCESSIONS

The number of pieces of mail received during the year was 28,783,
of which 7,321 publications were Government documents, and were
sent to the Library of Congress, in accordance with the established
practice. Additions to the library, as shown by the accession rec-
ords, are given below.

All payments are made by check, signed by the Secretary of the
Institution, on the Treasurer of the United States, and all revenues
are deposited to the credit of the same account, except in some in-
stances small deposits are placed in bank for convenience of collec-
tion and later are withdrawn in round amounts and deposited in the
Treasury.

The practice of investing temporarily idle funds in time deposits
has proven satisfactory. During the year the interest derived from
this source, together with other similar items, has resulted in a
total of $1,014.59.

The following appropriations were intrusted by Congress to the
care of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year 1924:

PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE SMITH-
SONIAN INSTITUTION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE
30, 1924

ANNUAL MEETING, DECEMBER 13, 1923

Present: The Hon. William H. Taft, Chief Justice of the United
States; Senator Henry Cabot Lodge; Representative Albert John-
son; Representative R. Walton Moore; the Hon. George Gray; the
Hon. Henry White; Mr. Robert S. Brookings; Mr. Irwin Laughlin;
Mr. Frederic A. Delano; and the secretary, Dr. Charles D. Walcott.

Judge Gray, as temporary chairman, called the meeting to order.

ELECTION OF A CHANCELLOR

The secretary said that the office of chancellor, to which Mr. Cool-
idge was elected by the board during his incumbency as Vice Presi-
dent, had been vacated by his elevation to the Presidency. Under
the law organizing the Institution (sec. 5582), “ The regents shall
meet in the city of Washington, and elect one of their number as
chancellor, who shall be the presiding officer of the Board of Regents.
and called the chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution.”

Senator Lodge offered the following resolution, which was
adopted :

Resolved, That Chief Justice Taft be elected chancellor of the Smithsonian
Institution.

APPOINTMENT OF REGENT

The secretary announced the reappointment of Senator Henry
Cabot Lodge as a Regent.

RESOLUTION RELATIVE TO INCOME AND EXPENDITURE

Judge Gray, chairman of the executive committee, presented the
following resolution, which on motion was adopted:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1925, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by
the secretary with the advice of the executive committee, with full discretion
on the part of the secretary as to items.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

The secretary submitted in printed form the annual report of the

_ executive committee, giving a statement of the financial condition
| of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1923.

128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE

The secretary, on behalf of the permanent committee, read the
report, as follows:

Hodgkins and Roebling funds.—Work is continuing steadily in the solar
radiation researches being conducted on the Montezuma Mountain, Chile, un-
der an annual grant of $5,000 from the Hodgkins fund. Mr. John A. Roebling
has added generously to his contributions to aid the work at this station, and
also at the one on Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz. These researches are being car-
ried on under the direction of Dr. Charles G. Abbot, assistant secretary of the
Institution and director of the Astrophysical Observatory.

Freer bequest.—The balance of the loan of $200,000 made to settle this estate
was paid during the year.

In view of the fact that the Freer Foundation is invested entirely in Parke,
Davis & Co.’s stock, the permanent committee took up the matter of safeguard-
ing its principal and income; and, after careful consideration, decided upon
what may be termed a sinking fund, by which that part of the income in ex-
cess of 6 per cent on the value of the foundation at the time of Mr. Freer’s
death is to be reinvested in high-class securities and real-estate mortgages
until an amount equal to the original foundation is reached.

Poore bequest.—Negotiations are now pending for the sale of several of the
lots in Lowell, Mass., received under this bequest, which will net the Institu-
tion about $1,500. The remaining lots will be disposed of as opportunity offers.
Since the last meeting of the board the city of Lowell has agreed to abate the
taxes on this property. .

All the other funds previously detailed are in sound condition and are slowly
but steadily increasing in volume through the addition of their earnings to
the principal.

_ The consolidated fund, which comprises bequests and gifts to the Institu-
tion in addition to the $1,000,000 deposited in the United States Treasury in

In submitting his annual report of the operations of the Institu-
tion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1923, the secretary stated
that the publications of the Institution are its chief means of carry-
ing out one of its primary functions, the “diffusion of knowledge
among men.” Since the last annual meeting of this board, in Decem-
ber 1922, the Institution and its branches have issued a total of 98
publications, both volumes and pamphlets. Of this number, 49 were
published by the Institution proper, 44 by the National Museum, 4
by the Bureau of American Ethnology, and 1 by the National Gallery
of Art. A large part of the edition of each of these publications is
distributed free to libraries, educational institutions, and specialists
throughout the world. The nation-wide popularity of the Smith-
sonian Annual Report is attested by the fact that a cataloguer in the
office of the Superintendent of Documents has placed it first among
all public documents in number of requests from libraries to receive
it. In connection with the publications, the secretary called atten-
tion to the inadequacy of the funds available for printing.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART COMMISSION

The third annual meeting of the National Gallery of Art Commis-
sion was held December 11, 1923. The resignation of Mr. Daniel
Chester French as chairman of the commission was received and ac-
cepted with regret, and Mr. Gari Melchers was elected chairman.

The report of the secretary of the commission and director of the
gallery presented a review of the activities of the gallery for the
year, and reports of the standing and special committees followed.

In response to the resolution submitted by the Regents, February
8, 1923, requesting the commission’s consideration of the suggestion
that a museum of architecture be founded in connection with the
Institution, the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the National Gallery of Art Commission recommend to the
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution the inclusion of a division of his-
torical architecture in the National Gallery of Art. The division should seek
to establish standards in architecture, furniture, and landscape architecture
for the benefit of students and others interested in the preservation of the
historic buildings of America.

The important problem of a national gallery building was con-
sidered and assurance given that the building plans would be pro-
vided for in the near future.

A resolution was passed recommending to the Board of Regents
the election of Mr. James E. Fraser and Mr. Joseph Breck to fill
vacancies caused by the resignation of Mr. Daniel Chester French
and the declination of Mr. Denman W. Ross.

The commission also voted to recommend to the Board of Regents
the election for the full term of four years of Messrs. Edwin H.
Blashfield, Joseph H. Gest, and Frank Jewett Mather, jr., their
two-year terms having expired.

After discussion, the following resolutions were adopted:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution approves
in principle the recommendation of the National Gallery of Art Commission
that a division of historical architecture be established in connection with the
National Gallery of Art.

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby
elects Mr. James E. Fraser and Mr. Joseph Breck as members of the commis-
sion, to fill the vacancies caused by the resignation of Mr. Daniel Chester
French and the declination of Mr. Denman W. Ross, respectively.

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby
elects Messrs. Edwin H. Blashfield, Joseph H. Gest, and Frank Jewett Mather,
jr., as members of the National Gallery of Art Commission for the full terin
of four years, their present two-year terms having expired.

MEMORIAL TO ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL

On behalf of the executive committee, the secretary submitted the
following report:
DECEMBER 13, 1923.
GENTLEMEN: The executive committee, designated by the Board of Regents:
at its annual meeting on December 14, 1922, to prepare for the records of the-
130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

board a brief memorial commemorating the life and work of Doctor Bell, a
former Regent of the Institution, begs to submit the following:

“Alexander Graham Bell, doctor of philosophy, doctor of science, a member
of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, was born March 32,
1847, at Edinburgh, Scotland.

“Doctor Bell was appointed a Regent on January 24, 1898, and served until

February 20, 1922. During this entire period of 24 years he was a member of
the executive and permanent committees of the board, where his sound judg-
ment and ripe experience were of great assistance to his associates.
* “Doctor Bell’s interest in the work of the Smithsonian Institution began
many years before his appointment as Regent, his studies in acoustics par-
ticularly having been the subject of many consultations with Secretary Henry.
Later, in 1887, when Samuel P. Langley was elected secretary, he resumed
his intimate though unofficial relations, as evidenced by his gift of $5,000 in
1891 in connection with the development of the Astrophysical Observatory, and
his helpful interest in the aerodynamical researches of Secretary Langley. It
was Doctor Bell who made the only successful photograph of the Langley
model in its first flight, May 6, 1896, though at this time he was independently
conducting exhaustive experiments in this new science.

“After he became a Regent, Doctor Bell was likewise active in forwarding
the work of the Institution in many directions. Among the notable matters
that particularly engaged his personal attention were:

“His voluntary service in transferring the remains of James Smithson,
founder of the Institution, from the English cemetery at Genoa, Italy, to their
final resting place in the Smithsonian Building

“His suggestion that resulted in the establishment of the Langley medal
in connection with the development of aviation ;

“His labors as a member of the committee on award of this medal; and

“His historical address upon Secretary Langley’s discovery of the principles
of aviation, delivered February 10, 1910, at the presentation of the Langley
medal to its first recipients, the Wright brothers.

* Doctor Bell had reached a high eminence in the scientific world iene before
his connection with the Institution. The history of his achievements is too
well known to be repeated here; but it is proper to mention his invention of
the telephone; his great work in the physiology of human speech that made
it possible for him to teach the deaf to speak; and his invention of the tele-
phone probe for detecting the presence of bullets in the human body. He was
a believer in geographic research and was one of the founders of the National
Geographic Society. He was a member of the National Academy of Sci-
ences, and of other national and international learned organizations, and was
the recipient of many medals, degrees, and other honors as a man of great
scientific achievement.

“ Doctor Bell had a strong physique, but the strain of many years of intense
endeavor made itself felt, and he found it necessary to give up much of his
work in the last year or two of his life. His weakness increased until the
end came on August 2, 1922, at his summer home near Baddeck, Nova Scotia.

“ Alexander Graham Bell was one of the outstanding men of his time,
and his death brought a highly useful career to a close.”

Respectfully submitted.

RADIO CELEBRATION OF JOSEPH HENRY’S BIRTHDAY

The secretary called attention to the birthday of Henry, first sec-
retary of the Smithsonian Institution, which is to be celebrated by
radio on December 17. The occasion will be observed by appropri-
ate addresses broadcast from the stations ‘at Troy and Schenectady,
N. Y.

Joseph Henry was born at Albany on December 17, 1799. His
first studies in electricity began in 1827, while he was a teacher in
the Albany Academy, and in the course of his researches he trans-
formed an inefficient piece of electrical apparatus into the powerful
electromagnet, and laid the foundation for the most important dis-
coveries of the century. He made two distinct forms of magnets;
one capable of excitation at a distance, called the “ intensity magnet,”
and the other having possibilities of infinite development of strength,
which he named the “ quantity magnet.”

Before Henry, the strongest form of electromagnet known could
lift only 9 pounds, but after a few months of experiment he pro-
duced one which sustained 39 pounds. This was successively fol-
lowed by others which could support 750, 2,300, and 3,500 pounds.
The intensity magnet was the forerunner of the modern telegraph,
and in 1831 Henry transmitted a current through a considerable
length of wire and succeeded in ringing a bell. On December 1%,
92 years later, this identical bell will be rung during the ceremonies,
and the sound will be heard by listeners throughout the United States
and probably across the Atlantic. The bell is now a treasured relic
in the New York State Museum at Albany.

When the Smithsonian Institution was founded, Joseph Henry
was selected as its first secretary, and his plan of organization for
the new Institution was carried out. His broad-minded policies en-
abled the Institution to become firmly established, and through its
stated purpose, “the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men,” to attain a world-wide reputation as a center of scientific ac-
tivity in America. During Henry’s term as secretary (1846-1878) he
inaugurated the system of daily meteorological observations and re-
ports which developed into the present United States Weather
Bureau.

EXPEDITIONS

Archeological expedition to China.—The archeological expedition
sent to China last February under the joint auspices of the Freer
Gallery of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and under the
immediate direction of Mr. Carl W. Bishop, associate curator of the
Freer Gallery, seems already to have paved the way for a far better
approach to the problems of Chinese archeology than has ever ex-
isted before. Mr. Bishop’s first duties have been to make clear to
132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

interested Chinese the spirit and purpose of the expedition, to estab-
lish among them a feeling of confidence in its integrity and ability,
and to organize a self-sustaining archeological society of native
scholars which should have the official sanction and support of the
Chinese Government in all its undertakings. These delicate and
difficult tasks Mr. Bishop has prosecuted with an extraordinary
degree of skill and success. The archeological society, with head-
quarters in Peking and a membership composed of the most influen-
tial scholars and Government officials, has already made arrange-
ments with the authorities for the expedition to undertake the exca-
vation of two highly important sites, on the understanding that
while the records and reports of the operations shall be at its disposal
the material “ finds” shall be equally divided between the Chinese
Government and the expedition.

Mr. Bishop also has been fortunate enough to acquire for the
expedition several fine examples of Chinese art, but it is his success
in establishing for the first time a truly cooperative relationship
between Chinese and American archeologists which must be thought
to justify the expedition, even had it accomplished nothing else.

Biological expedition to China——Through the continued generos-
ity of Dr. William L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, an expedition to the
Yangtze Valley, in China, was arranged for the purpose of obtain-
ing specimens of vertebrates peculiar to that locality, and Mr.
Charles M. Hoy, who had previously explored in the central China
region, left the United States for this purpose in December, 1922.
I greatly regret to report that in September, 1923, Mr. Hoy was
seized with an acute attack of appendicitis and that his death oc-
curred on the 6th of that month. This is a serious loss to the Mu-
seum, but, thanks to Doctor Abbott, arrangements have been made
to turn Mr. Hoy’s collecting and field outfit over to the Rev. D. C.
Graham, of Suifu, from whom several valuable sendings have been
received, and who is contemplating extensive excursions into the
more interesting and little known parts of Szechwan.

Doctor Abbott’s generosity has been frequently called to the atten-
tion of the board, large contributions having been made by him for
the expeditions to Borneo, Celibes, Australia, and the present ones
in China, in addition to which he has given largely from the results
of his personal efforts in Haiti and elsewhere.

Alberta and British Columbia—During the summer and fall of
1923, the secretary of the Institution carried on geological field work
in the Canadian Rockies in this region. This work was in continua-
tion of the operations of the previous year in the main range and the
western minor ranges that form the great eastern wall of the Colum-
bia River Valley from Golden southward to Kootenay River.

The season was favorable for geological work, and a large supply
of material was secured which will he studied later.

REORGANIZATION OF GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS

The secretary spoke of the proposed reorganization of Government
Departments, under which it was proposed to include the Smith-
sonian Institution in a Department of Education.

The following considerations were mentioned among others:

1. A large part of the success which the Institution has had in
carrying on and aiding research work hag been due to the fact that
varying political fortunes have no effect on its direction. Its secre-
tary is selected by the Board of Regents provided for in the act
creating the Institution. It is thus enabled to pursue a definite and
continuous policy which is unaffected by political changes.

2. During the 77 years of its existence as an independent establish-
ment the Smithsonian Institution has acquired a reputation and
standing throughout the civilized world as a center of scientific
endeavor in America. To place it in the position of a subordinate
member of an educational department would impair its standing
and so relegate it to an unimportant position far from the intention of
its founder, of the act of Congress establishing the Institution, and of
those who have since made large gifts to it, principally because it
was independent of political and sectarian domination.

3. Freedom of action, one of its chief assets in various scientific
activities and in international undertakings, would be entirely lost
if the Institution were placed under the administration of a political
unit of the Government.

There was a very general expression of disapproval of the proposed
plan.

NEED OF AN ADDITIONAL ASSISTANT SECRETARY

The secretary stated that there was urgent need for the provision
for an assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to be
charged, under the direction of the secretary, with the administra-
tion of the National Museum, Art Galleries, Zoological Park, and
the Bureau of American Ethnology, and with such other duties as
may from time to time be assigned to him by the secretary. The
care and development of these four branches involve the employ-
ment of highly trained specialists and their assistants, and the coordi-
nation of the activities of each group with those of the other groups
and also with those of research and technical workers in the great
Government bureaus, such as those of the Agriculture, Interior, and
Commerce Departments, and the great research institutions and uni-
versity laboratories throughout our country and in foreign lands.
Such coordination requires the initiative, guidance, and constant
supervision of an able, well-trained, and experienced broadly cul-
134 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

tured scientific man who must also have considerable administrative
ability.

After full discussion, on motion, the following resolution was
adopted :

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution declare
the need of an additional assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
whose salary shall be provided for by congressional appropriation; the said
assistant secretary to be charged with the administration, under the direction
of the secretary, of the National Museum, Art Galleries, Zoological Park, and
Bureau of American Ethnology, and with such other duties as may from time
to time be assigned to him by the secretary.

FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

The secretary spoke of the urgent need of a larger endowment for
the institution; that work of the most important character was
being held back for lack of funds to carry it on.

The secretary presented a supplemental statement giving a brief
résumé of the activities of the various branches of the Institution
during the past fiscal year. These will be described more fully in
the annual report for 1924.

REGULAR MEETING, FEBRUARY 14, 1924

Present: Senator A. Owsley Stanley; Representative R. Walton
Moore; Representative Walter H. Newton; Mr. Charles F. Choate,
jr.; Mr. Robert S. Brookings; Mr. Irwin B. Laughlin; and the sec-
retary, Dr. Charles D. Walcott. Mr. Choate presided.

APPOINTMENT OF REGENTS

The secretary announced that the Speaker of the House had reap-
pointed Messrs. Albert Johnson and R. Walton Moore as Regents
and had filled the vacancy caused by Mr. Greene’s election to the
Senate by the appointment of Mr. Walter H. Newton, of Minnesota.

BUILDING FOR ART AND HISTORY

The secretary spoke of the proposed building for the National
Gallery of Art and History, displaying sketch plans of its general
outline and its location, stating that it comprehended a building
somewhat over 500 feet long by 300 feet deep, with an elevation of
about 80 feet. He quoted the act granting the use of the site on
B Street NW., between Seventh and Ninth Streets.

ARCHITECT FOR ART AND HISTORY BUILDING

At the annual meeting of the board, on December 13, 1923, the
National Gallery of Art Commission reported that provision would
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS 1385

be made in the near future for the preparation of building plans for
the proposed new building. The commission met recently and re-
ported that funds for the employment of an architect had been pro-
vided by private contributions from 13 persons to the amount of
$11,000. The commission, having canvassed the names of a number
of American architects who had been suggested as qualified to pre-
pare the plans, recommended the selection of Mr. Charles A. Platt,
whose selection was approved by the Board of Regents.

After discussion, a motion was adopted appointing Messrs. White
and Delano, of the Board of Regents; Messrs. Adams, Melchers, and
Gest, of the commission; and the secretary of the Institution as a
committee to collaborate ea the apelibeet) in the preparation of the
plans for the new building.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

The secretary read a letter from Mr. Gilbert H. Grosvenor express-
ing the appreciation of the family of the late Dr. A. Graham Bell
for the memorial adopted by the board at the annual meeting on
December 13 last.

SPECIAL MEETING, JUNE 38, 1924

Present: Senator Henry Cabot Lodge; Representative Albert
Johnson; Representative Walter H. Newton; the Hon. George Gray;
Mr. Henry White; and the secretary, Dr. Charles D. Walcott.
Senator Lodge presided.

AUTHORITY FOR CALLING SPECIAL MEETINGS

The secretary explained that the fundamental act provides for
calling special meetings at the request of three Regents, and that
this meeting had been called by the executive committee and ap-
proved by the chancellor.

ADDITIONAL ASSISTANT SECRETARY

The secretary brought up the matter of an additional assistant
secretary, explaining that at the annual meeting on December 13,
1923, the Board of Regents adopted a resolution declaring the need
of such an officer, which had been communicated to the President.
With the President’s approval, the Director of the Budget sub-
mitted the request to Congress, after the Personnel Classification
Board had put the position in class 6. The Appropriations Com-
mittee fixed the annual salary at $6,000, and the item was now
included in the independent offices bill under “Smithsonian Insti-
tution.”
136 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

ESTIMATES FOR NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

The secretary stated that—

Estimates are at present submitted by the Smithsonian Institution to the
District Commissioners (a copy is forwarded direct to the Bureau of the
Budget) for inclusion in the District of Columbia estimates. The commissioners
forward these to the Bureau of the Budget with all other estimates int@nded for
the District of Columbia appropriation bill. The Director of the Budget
returns the complete estimates to the District Commissioners with a state-
ment as to the maximum figures that will be allowed the District for the whole
bill. It is the duty of the commissioners to reduce the estimates to this
figure and return to the Bureau of the Budget.

The District Commissioners have their own troubles and urgent require-
ments, and, since the allotment made is far under their own estimates, it is
only natural that they should give first consideration to items for which
they are directly responsible—streets, sewers, fire and police protection,
schools, ete. In the three years since the Zoological Park has been included
in the District bill, no hearings of any kind have been given the Institution
on the Zoo estimates by the District Commissioners. For two years the
estimates were simply reduced to the figures for the previous year and re-
turned to the Budget without the Institution even knowing the amount thus
approved by the commissioners. The commissioners even changed all figures
in the detailed statement accompanying the estimates to agree exactly with
those of the preceding year, thus presenting to the Budget and later to Con-
gress useless and misleading figures in explanation of the proposed ex-
penditures.

I do not think that the District Commissioners should be given the arbi-
trary power to control the finances of the National Zoological Park, which is
placed by law under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution.

It should be practicable to include the estimate for the Zoological Park in
the independent offices bill along with the other estimates for Government
bureaus administered under the direction of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution. The latter are held responsible for the care and
administration of the park and there should be no divided responsibility in
natters bearing upon its administration.

After discussion, on motion of Mr. Newton, the following resolu-
tion was adopted:

Resolved, That it is the sense of this meeting of the Board of Regents that
the appropriation for the National Zoological Park should be carried in the
independent offices bill, as are the items for the other Government bureaus
administered under the direction of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Tustitution.
GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1924

137
ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Genera, Appenprx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such
papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific
progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geol-
ogy, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology,
and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not alto-
gether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them orig-
inal) embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and
discussion. This method has been continued in the present report
for 1924.

THE ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM?

By J. H. JEANS
Secretary, Royal Society of London

[With 5 plates]

The astronomer of to-day has at his disposal telescopes which
range in aperture from his naked eye, of aperture about one-fifth
of an inch, up to the giant Mount Wilson telescope of more than
100 inches. If we lived in the midst of a uniform infinite field of
stars, or in a field which was uniform as far as our telescopes could
reach, the numbers of stars visible in different telescopes would be
proportional to the cubes of their apertures.

In actual fact our naked eyes reveal about 5,000 stars; with a one-
inch telescope this number is increased to about 100,000, with a
10-inch to 5,000,000, and with the 100-inch telescope to perhaps
100,000,000. ‘These numbers increase much less rapidly than the
cubes of the apertures. We conclude that we are not surrounded by
an infinite uniform field of stars. We live in a finite universe, which
thins out quite perceptibly within distances reached by telescopes
of very moderate size. It is estimated that the whole universe con-
sists of some 1,500 million stars, our sun being not very far from the
center of the system.

Imagine the various celestial objects in this universe arranged
according to their distance from us. Disregarding altogether bodies
which are much smaller than our earth, we must give first place to
the planets Venus and Mars, which approach to within 26 and 35
millions of miles, respectively. Next comes Mercury with a closest
approach of 47 million miles, and the sun at 93 million miles. The
remainder of the planets follow at distances ranging up to 2,800
million miles, the radius of the orbit of Neptune.

But now comes a great gap. The first objects beyond this gap
are the faint star Proxima Centauri at a distance of 24 million
million miles, or more than 8,000 times the distance of Neptune,
and, close to it, a Centauri at 25 million million miles. Next in
order come the faint red star Munich 15,040 at 36 million million

140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

miles, and another faint star Lalande 21,185 at about 47 million
million miles. Thus our nearest neighbors among the stars are at
almost exactly a million times the distances of our nearest neighbors
among the planets. After these comes Sirius, the brightest star in
the sky, at 50 million million miles. From here on there is a steady
succession of objects until we reach distances of more than 20,000
times that of Sirius; but long before these distances are reached
other objects, spiral and spheroidal nebule, and ultimately star
clusters, are found to be mingled with the stars. The furthest
object the distance of which is known with any accuracy is the
star cluster N. G. C. 7006, which Shapley estimates to be 25,000
times as distant as Sirius. This cluster is so remote that its hight
takes 200,000 years to reach us; even for light to cross the cluster
takes hundreds of years. To all appearances the star cloud N. G. C.
6822 is still more remote. According to Shapley, its distance is
about 6 million million million miles, a distance which light takes
a million years to traverse. So far as is known at present, this
brings us to the end of our universe, or perhaps I ought to say it
brings us back to the beginning.

It is no easy matter to get all these different distances clearly
into focus simultaneously, but let us try. The earth speeds round
the sun at about twenty miles a second; in a year it describes an
orbit of nearly 600 million miles circumference. If we represent
the earth’s orbit by a pinhead or a full stop of radius one-hundredth
of an inch, the sun will be an invisible speck of dust, and the earth
an ultramicroscopic particle one-millionth of an inch in diameter.
Neptune’s orbit, which incloses the whole of the solar system, will
be represented by a circle the size of a threepenny piece, while the
distance to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, will be about 75
yards and that to Sirius about 160 yards. On this same scale the
distance to the remote star cluster N. G. C. 7006 is 2,400 miles and
that to the star cloud N. G. C. 6822 about 12,000 miles, so that
roughly speaking the whole universe may be represented by our
earth.

It thus appears that we are on this occasion to discuss the origin
and past history of a system which bears the same relation to the
universe as a whole as does a threepenny piece to our earth. Why
are we so interested in this particular threepenny piece? Primarily
because, although a poor thing, it is our own, or at least one particle
of it, one-millionth of an inch in diameter, is our own. But there is
a historical reason of a less sentimental kind. We have already
noticed the immensity of the gap between our system and its nearest
neighbors. As regards astronomical knowledge this gap has taken
a great deal of crossing. Well on into last century, human knowl-
|

ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 141

edge of the further side of this gap was infinitesimal; the stars were
scarcely more than points of light, described as “fixed stars.” In
those days the problem of cosmogony reduced perforce to the prob-
lem of the origin of our own system.

Recent research has changed all this, and the modern astronomer
has a very extensive knowledge of the nature, structure, and move-
ments of the various bodies outside our system. The cosmogonist
of a century ago could assert that the solar system had evolved in
such and such a way, and need have no fear of his theories being
upset by comparison with other systems. But if I put before you
now a theory of the origin of our system, you will at once inquire as
to the behavior of the 1,500 million or so of systems beyond the
great gap. Are they following the same evolutionary course as our
own system, and, if not, why not? It may be well to consider thes
other systems first.

Among these 1,500 million or so of objects there are certain com-
paratively small classes the nature and interpretation of which are
still enigmatical—the planetary nebule, the Cepheid variables, the
long-period variables such as Mira Ceti, and a few others. Apart
from these, practically all known bodies can be arranged in one single
continuous sequence. The sequence is approximately one of increas-
ing density; it begins with nebule of almost incredible tenuity and
ends with solid stars as dense as iron. There is but little doubt that
the sequence is an evolutionary one, for the laws of physics require
that as a body radiates heat its density should increase, at least until
it can increase no further. Let us begin our survey at the furthest
point back to which we can attain on this evolutionary chain—the -
nebule.

After the enigmatical “ planetary ” nebule have been excluded, the
remaining nebul fall into two fairly sharply defined classes, which
may be briefly described as regularly and irregularly shaped nebule.

The irregularly shaped nebule comprise such objects as the great
nebula in Orion, and the nebulosity surrounding the Pleiades.
Until quite recently these irregular nebule were supposed to be of
great evolutionary importance. It was noticed that they were
usually associated with the very hottest stars; whence arose a
beautifully simple cosmogony asserting that these very hot stars
were the immediate products of condensation of the nebulz, and that
their after life consisted merely of a gradual cooling until they got
quite cold. This cosmogony was too simple to live for long—it was
buried some ten years ago by the researches of Russell, Hertzsprung,
and others. Thanks to these researches, we now know that the very
hot stars associated with irregular nebule, so far from being newly
born, are standing at the summit of their lives awaiting their decline
into old age.
142 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

A mass of hot gas isolated in space radiates heat, and this causes
it to contract. If the mass radiated without contracting, it would,
of course, get cooler; on the other hand, if it contracted without
radiating, it would get hotter. But when radiation and contraction
are proceeding together it is not obvious without mathematical in-
vestigation which of the two tendencies will take command. In 1870
Homer Lane showed that a mass of gas of density low enough for
the ordinary gas laws to be approximately obeyed, will in actual fact
get hotter as it radiates heat away. Cooling does not set in until a
density is reached at which the gas laws are already beginning to
fail—that is to say when liquefaction and solidification are already
within measurable distance. Thus we see that maximum temper-
ature is associated with middle age in a star, the age at which the
star may no longer be regarded as a perfect gas. At this period of
middle age the surface temperature of the star may be anything up
to about 25,000° C., while the temperature at its center will amount
to millions of degrees. Its average density will probably be some-
thing like one-tenth of that of water. It is still not known why
stars at this special maximum temperature are so commonly asso-
ciated with irregular nebule. Possibly it may be that only stars at
the very highest temperatures are capable of lighting up surrounding
nebulosity which would otherwise remain invisible. Be this as it
may, it is fairly clear that these irregular nebular masses are not an
essential part of the evolutionary chain. They are probably mere
by-products, and as such may be dismissed from further con-
sideration.

We turn to the nebule of regular shape. A great number of
these appear as circles or ellipses, some as ellipses drawn out at the
ends of their major-axes, sometimes almost to sharp points. An
example of this last type of figure is shown in Plate 1, Figure 1
(Nebula N. G. C. 3115).

A number of these regular-shaped nebule have been examined
spectroscopically, and in every case have been found to be rotating
with high velocities about an axis which appears in the sky as the
shortest diameter of the nebula. The mathematician can calculate
what configurations will be assumed by masses of tenuous gas in
rotation. If rotation were entirely absent the mass would, of ‘course,
assume a spherical shape. With slow rotation its shape would be
an oblate spheroid of low ellipticity—an orange-shaped figure like
our earth. At higher rotations the spheroidal shape is departed
from, the equator bulging out more and more until finally, for quite
rapid rotation, the shape is approximately that of a double convex
lens having a sharp circular edge for its equator, the shape, in fact,
exhibited by the nebula shown in Plate 1, Figure 1. The whole
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 1438

succession of figures, if looked at along all possible lines of sight,
will exhibit precisely the series of shapes which are found to be
exhibited by the regular nebule under discussion. There are, then,
good grounds for conjecturing that these nebule are rotating masses
of gas; but we can test this conjecture further before finally ac-
cepting it.

As a mass of gas radiates its energy away it must shrink. If it
is in rotation, its angular momentum will remain constant, and the
shrunken mass can only carry its original dose of angular momentum
by rotating more rapidly than before. This conception, which
formed the corner-stone of the cosmogonies of Kant and Laplace, is
still of fundamental importance to the cosmogonist of to-day. Thus
every nebula, as it grows older, will rotate ever more and more
rapidly and, barring accidents, will in due course reach the configura-
tion shown in Plate 1, Figure 1. This configuration marks a verita-
ble landmark in the evolutionary path of a nebula. Until this con-
figuration is reached the effect of shrinkage can be adjusted, and
is adjusted, by a mere change of shape; the mass carries the same
angular momentum as before, in spite of its reduced size, by the
simple expedient of rotating more rapidly, and restores equilibrium
by bulging out its equator. But mathematical analysis shows that
this is no longer possible when once this landmark has been passed.
Further shrinkage now involves an actual break-up of the nebula,
the excess of the angular momentum beyond that which can be
carried by the shrunken mass being thrown off into space by the
ejection of matter from the equator of the nebula.

We have so far spoken of the nebular equator as being of circular
shape, as it undoubtedly would be if the nebula were alone by itself
in space. But an actual nebula must have neighbors, and these
neighbors will raise tides on its surface, just as the sun and moon
raise tides on the surface of the rotating earth. Whatever the neigh-
bors are, there will always be two points of high tide antipodally
opposite to one another, and two points of low tide intermediate be-
tween the two points of high tide. Thus the equator, instead of
being strictly circular, will be slightly elliptical.

If the equator of the nebula had been a perfect circle, and if the
nebula had been in all respects symmetrical about its axis of rota-
tion, the ejection of matter would have started from all points of
the equator simultaneously. Indeed, there could be no conceivable
reason why it should start at one point rather than at any other
point. But in nature we do not expect to find perfect balances of
this kind; if the main factors are of exactly equal weight some
quite minor factor invariably intervenes to turn the balance in one
direction or another. In the present problem there could be no
144 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

choice as between one point of the equator and another if the various
minor factors were absent, but when these minor factors come into
play, a discrimination at once takes place. Assuming, as seems
likely, that the tidal irregularities are the minor factors which de-
termine the choice of points for the ejection of matter, mathematical
investigation shows that the ejection of matter will take place from
the two antipodal points on the equator at which the tide is highest.
The equator being slightly elliptical, these points are of course the
ends of its major-axis. After the nebula has passed its critical land-
mark, shown in Plate 1, Figure 1, its shape ought to be similar to the
lenticular figure which formed the landmark, but with the additional
feature of matter streaming out from two antipodal points on its
equator.

This describes exactly what is observed in the spiral nebule. Plate
1, Figure 2 (N. G. C. 5866) shows a nebula in which the ejection
of matter is just beginning; we notice the bulge along the equator
and the dark band which we may assume represents ejected matter
which is already cooling. Plate 2, Figure 1 (N. G. C. 4594) exhibits
a more advanced state of development; and Plate 2, Figure 2 (N.
G. C. 891), a still later one in which the ejected matter already
dwarfs the central nucleus in size, although probably not in total
mass.

In all these figures we are looking at the nebule very approxi-
mately edge-on. Plate 3, Figure 1 (M. 51) shows the well-known
“ whirlpool” in Canes Venatici, a nebula which may be very similar
physically to that shown in Plate 2, Figure 2, but we see it face on;
we are looking along its axis of rotation. Again the central nucleus
occupies only a small part of the picture. Plate 3, Figure 2 (M. 101)
and Plate 4, Figure 1 (M. 81) shows two nebule, the evolution of
which has proceeded still further, so much so that in the last of
these there is very little nucleus left, and by far the greater part of
what we see is what we believe to be ejected matter.

In both of these last two nebule it will be seen that the arms of
ejected matter proceed from two antipodal points, exactly as re-
quired by dynamical theory. So far we have spoken of the matter
in these arms as ejected matter because theory has suggested this
interpretation, but we need not be satisfied with theory; there is
very direct observational evidence on the point. Various astrono-
mers, especially Van Maanen, have detected motion in the arms of
many nebule, including the three shown in Plate 3, Figures 1 and 2,
and Plate 4, Figure 1. Their observations show that the arms are in
truth jets of matter coming out of the nucleus. Plate 4, Figure 2
shows the motion found by Van Maanen for about 100 points in the
nebula M. 81, the arrows showing the motion in a period of 1,300
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 145

years,” and the measures on the various other nebule show sub-
stantially similar results; you will see that there is little room for

doubting that the arms consist of matter flowing out of the nucleus.
On measuring the actual velocities of flow it is found that in nebula
M. 51 (pl. 3, fig. 1) a particle of the jet makes a complete
revolution around the nucleus in about 45,000 years; in M. 81 (pl.
4, fig. 1) the corresponding figure is about 58,000 years, and in M.
101 (pl. 3, fig. 2) about 85,000 years. From these figures it is
possible to estimate the density of the matter in the nucleus. It is
found that the densities must be of the order of 107° gm. per cubic
centimeter, a figure representing a vacuum more perfect than any
obtainable in the laboratory. The small amount of gas in an ordi-
nary electric light bulb, if spread out through St. Paul’s Cathedral,
would still be something like 10,000 times as dense as the nucleus
of a spiral nebula.

The nebula shown in Plate 2, Figure 2 exhibits a lumpy or granu-
lated appearance in its arms. In M. 51 (pl. 3, fig. 1) this takes the
form of pronounced condensations, and in the outer regions of M.
101 (pl. 3, fig. 2) and M. 81 (pl. 4, fig. 1) these condensations have
further developed into detached and almost star-like points of light.

When gas is set free out of an ordinary nozzle into a vacuum it
immediately spreads into the whole of the space accessible to it.
Why then does not the jet of gas shot off from the equator of the
nebula do the same? The explanation is to be found in the gigantic
scale on which this latter process takes place. As we increase the
scale of the phenomenon the mutual gravitational attraction of the
particles of gas becomes of ever greater importance until finally, by
the time nebular dimensions are reached, gravitation overcomes the
expansive influence of gas pressure and is able to hold the jet to-
gether as a compact stream. But, as soon as this happens, dynamical
theory predicts that a further phenomenon ought to appear. As
regards the distribution of density along the filament, the influence
of gas-pressure is in the direction of keeping the density spread out
uniformly, while that of gravitation is toward making the stream
condense with compact globules. When nebular dimensions are
reached the latter tendency prevails, and the issuing jet of gas breaks
up into drops much as a jet of water issuing from a nozzle does,
although for a very different physical reason. In the photographs
reproduced in Plate 2, Figure 2; Plate 3, Figures 1 and 2; and
Plate 4, Figure 1, we can trace this process going on.

Dynamical theory not only predicts that these globules of gas
must form, but also enables us to calculate their size, mass, and

2'The points surrounded by small circles are stars which are believed to have no physi-
cal connection with the nebula.
146 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

distance apart. A comparison between their distance apart, as cal
culated in kilometers, and their angular distance apart, as observed
in the sky, leads at once to an estimate of the distance of the nebula

to which they belong. It is gratifying to find that estimates of |
nebular distances made in this way are in good agreement with
estimates made in other ways. The calculation of the masses of
these condensations leads to a still more interesting and significant
result. In every nebula for which the calculation can be made, the
calculated mass of a single condensation proves to be approximately
equal to the mass of the average star.

‘This gives, I believe, the key to the evolutionary process we have
been considering—we have been watching the creation of the stars.
In Plate 1, Figure 1 we saw the raw material—a gaseous mass of ex-
treme tenuity, already moulded, as a result of shrinkage and conse-
quent increase of rotation, to the stage at which disintegration is
ubout to commence. Further shrinkage takes place, and in Plate 1,
Figure 2, and Plate 2, Figure 1 we see the ejection of jets of gas
from which the future stars will in due course be made. In Plate
2, Figure 2, and Plate 3, Figure 1 individual stars are beginning to
form, although at present only as vague condensations in what is
still a continuous nebular mass. Finally, the outermost parts of
Plate 3, Figure 2, and Plate 4, Figure 1 show us the finished prod-
uct—separate masses, although still far more tenuous than ordinary
stars, starting off on their independent existences. Each of these
masses will go through the changes we have already briefly described.
It will contract, getting hotter in doing so, until it reaches a maxi-
mum temperature just as the gas laws are beginning to fail, after
which it cools and contracts into a dead dark mass.

The family of stars born out of a single nebula may be millions
in number. They may either mingle with the general mass of the
stars or, if the original nebula was sufficiently remote from the main
universe of stars, may form a separate colony by themselves. In
illustration of the former alternative, numbers of groups of stars
are known—e. g. the Pleiades, the stars of the Great Bear—in which
all the members have a common velocity and, generally speaking,
similar physical constitutions also. All the stars of any such group
are voyaging through space together, and have obviously done so
since they first came into being. The alternative possibility of a
family of stars forming a detached colony by themselves is perhaps
exemplified in the so-called “globular” star-clusters, such as the
well-known cluster in Hercules (pl. 5). These are globular only in
name, for Shapley has found that they are of an elliptical structure,
showing symmetry about a plane precisely as might be expected if
they were the final product of a rotating nebula.

ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 147

Probably we ought not to regard the two possibilities just men-
tioned as sharply cut alternatives. It is more likely that they repre-
sent the two extreme ends of a continuous chain of possible histories
for the family of stars born out of a single nebula. It seems quite
possible that what we describe as “the main mass of the stars” may
be nothing more than a collection of clusters of stars, each cluster
having originated out of a single nebula. The clusters are by now so
intermingled that it is difficult to look on them as distinct groups
of stars, although we can still find some evidence that this may be
the proper way of regarding them. In 1905 Kapteyn showed that
the stars in the neighborhood of the sun formed what he described
as two “star streams,” each stream moving with its own velocity in
space. Except that it begs the question as to the extent of these
streams in space, it would have been equally accurate to describe
them as forming two intermingled moving clusters. Shortly after,
Eddington and Halm, independently, found a third stream or moy-
ing cluster, constituted of the very hot stars which the astronomer
classifies as stars of types B and O. In this case we know the extent
of the cluster in space and also its approximate shape. According
to Charlier, it is shaped like a round biscuit lying parallel te the
Milky Way, its diameter being about 2.8 times its thickness. Any
cluster of stars having a common origin, whatever shape it may as-
sume at first, will be rapidly knocked out of shape when it begins to
intermingle with other stars. Dynamical theory shows that after
it has been knocked about ad infinitum in our universe of stars, such
a cluster ought to assume the shape of a round biscuit parallel to
the Milky Way, the ratio of its diameter to its thickness being about
2.5. This agrees sufficiently well with what is observed to suggest
that all the stars in this stream have a common origin, and the same
is true of many of the smaller known moving clusters, such as the
Ursa Major cluster already mentioned. Thus, although we can not
claim that anything is definitely proved, there is every justification
for thinking of the main mass of the stars as a jumble of inter-
mingled moving clusters, each cluster owing its existence to a sepa-
rate nebula. This possibility has no very direct bearing on the ques-
tion of the origin of our solar system; it has been mentioned merely
as rounding off our knowledge of what appears to be the main evolu-
tionary process of the stars.

In all its essentials except one, this evolutionary process is similar
to, and in its earlier stages almost identical with, that which Laplace,
in his famous nebular hypothesis, imagined as the origin of the
solar system. We have seen before our eyes the rotating and shrink-
ing nebula finally shedding matter from its equator; we have
watched the condensation of this matter into separate masses, and
148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

have finally witnessed the start of these detached masses on their
voyages into space, all precisely as pictured by Laplace.

The one essential difference is that of size. The evolutionary
process we have been watching occurs on a scale such as Laplace
never dreamed of. His primeval nebula was supposed to be of
about the size of Neptune’s orbit, a size represented on the scale I
used at the beginning of this lecture by a threepenny-bit. On this
same scale the nucleus alone of a good-sized spiral nebula, such as
those shown in Plate 3, Figure 2, and Plate 4, Figure 1, would be
about the size of the Albert Hall, while the arms would sprawl over
the whole of Hyde Park and Kensington. The pictures of these
nebule that you have before you would have to be enlarged to the
size of a whole country, or even possibly of a whole continent, before
a body the size of our earth became visible in them at all.

Although the parent nebule we have been considering are all in-
comparably greater than Laplace’s imaginary nebula, yet each tiny
condensation, as it starts off into space, is a gaseous nebula the mass
of which is just about equal to that imagined by Laplace and the
size of which is not perhaps very greatly different. If, then, this
younger generation of nebule meet with the same experiences in life
as their giant parents before them, we should not have to look far
for an explanation of the origin of the planets, and if the third gen-
eration again repeated the experience of their ancestors, the satellites
of the planets are also accounted for. But mathematical research
and observation agree in disposing of so simple an explanation of
the origin of the solar system. As we have seen, it is only because
the filaments in the spiral nebule are of such huge size that gravita-
tion is able to cause condensation in opposition to the expansive
tendency of gas pressure. A nebula of mass comparable to our sun
might go through the same life history as the bigger nebula until
matter began to be thrown off from its equator, but after this the dif-
ference of scale would begin to tell, and the subsequent course of
events would be widely different. The ejected matter could not
condense into filaments, still less into detached globules; it would
merely constitute a diffuse atmosphere surrounding the parent
nebula. As such a system shrank by the emission of radiation, the
constancy of angular momentum would, at first, merely demand that
more and more gas should be transferred from the center to the
atmosphere.

But mathematical investigation shows that in time, after the cen-
tral star had shrunk to a certain critical density, perhaps somewhere
about one-tenth of that of water, a cataclysmic period would ensue,
from which the mass would emerge as a binary star—two stars of
comparable masses revolving about one another nearly in contact
and in approximately circular orbits. This is a formation with
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 149

which the practical astronomer is very familiar. He finds that
a very large proportion—perhaps about one-half—of the stars in
the sky are binary, and he can detect an evolutionary sequence in
these binary stars. The sequence starts with the formation just
described in which the two constituent stars are almost in contact.
As it progresses the stars move ever farther and farther apart, while
the eccentricity of their orbits increases. Theory indicates that the
process of fission which has broken up the original star into two
constituents may repeat itself in either or both of these constituents,
so that the final product may be a “multiple” star of either three or
four constituents. Prof. H. N. Russell, investigating this question
theoretically, found that certain numerical relations must hold be-
tween the relative distances of the various constituents of a mul-
tiple star; he also showed that the predictions of theory are con-
firmed Se by observation.

So far, then, theory and observation have gone hand in hand.
We have need the evolution of astronomical matter through stages
of ever-increasing density, from the most tenuous of nebule to the
densest of multiple stars, and at almost every stage observation has
confirmed the predictions of theory. Not all astronomical matter
will traverse the whole length of this evolutionary course. The
driving force on this course is increase of rotation consequent on the
shrinkage produced by emission of radiation. When the shrinkage
has proceeded a certain length solidification sets in; the rotation can
increase now no further, and evolution, in the physical sense, stops.
The distance along the course to which any particular system pro-
ceeds depends in effect on the amount of rotation with which it was
originally endowed. Let a nebula begin its career with absolutely
no rotation and it will remain sperical in shape throughout its whole
career, ending merely as a cold non-radiating, but always spherical,
mass. Such a nebula never even gets away from the starting-post.
It is true that this is not a likely event, but for aught we know many
a nebula may freeze and die before reaching the critical configura-
tion (pl. 1, fig. 1) at which the birth of stars first commences.
Similarly many of the stars may become cold and so cease to develop
without ever attaining the stage at which binary systems are formed.
In the same way many binary systems must fail to develop into
multiple systems. Here again observation is with us; there are ten
times as many purely binary systems known as there are multiple
systems which have proceeded beyond the binary stage. Theory has
traced out for us the whole length of the evolutionary course, but
theory and observation agree that not many systems stay out the
whole course.

203972511
150 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

We now come to the crux of the whole question. Nowhere on this
course have we found our solar system or anything in the least degree
resembling it. If our sun had been unattended by planets we should
have had no difficulty in guessing its origin. It might reasonably
be supposed to have been born out of a nebula in the normal way,
but to have emerged with insufficient rotation to have carried it on
to the later stages of fission into a binary or a multiple system. It
might, in fact, be supposed to have had the same evolutionary career
as half of the stars in the sky. In support of the conjecture that
our sun had been born out of a nebula in the ordinary way, we could
note that its mass is about equal to what we calculate ought to be the
mass of a star born out of a nebula, and that it is, apart from its
planets, similar in every way to millions of other stars to which we
may ascribe a nebular origin. In support of the conjecture that it
had stopped short on its evolutionary course from want of adequate
rotation to carry it on further, we should merely have to note the
slowness of its present rotation. <A simple calculation shows that
the sun has only a small fraction of the amount of angular mo-
mentum requisite for fission. Even if we add the angular mo-
mentum of all the planets, as we ought if we suppose that these at
one time formed part of the sun, the result is the same—the whole
system can never have had more than a fraction of the angular mo-
mentum necessary for a rotational break-up into a binary star.

Thus the sun is a quite intelligible structure. The difficulty of
our problem is not the origin of the sun but the origin of the planets
and of their satellites.

Certain special types of astronomical structure have already been
mentioned as not falling into place on the main line of evolutionary
development. The particular examples chosen were the planetary
nebule, the Cepheid variables, and the long-period variables. The
question now arises as to whether we must add the solar system to the
list. The circumstance that certain structures do not find a place in
the evolutionary main line suggests that off this main line may be
branch lines on to which the development of a system may in cer-
tain circumstances be turned. This, indeed, is only what might be
anticipated. We should no more expect two stars to have precisely
the same experiences in their careers than we should expect it of two
humans. Our normal star has been supposed to develop in a uni-
verse of its own, where its angular momentum remained constant
and where it was in every way unmolested by its neighbors. The
mathematician finds it convenient to allot a whole infinite universe to
each star, but nature does not. Nevertheless, the conditions postu-
lated by the mathematician are nearer to the truth than is often the
case in his idealized problems. On the scale we have already used, on
which the sun was represented by a microscopic particle y5}55 inch
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 151

in diameter, the most gigantic of known giant stars may be repre-
sented by a pin head one-thirtieth of an inch in diameter. The pres-
ent spacing of the stars is such that on this scale there is less than
one star to a volume equal to the interior of St. Paul’s Cathedral.
Space then can not be said to be overcrowded, and although it is
possible that the stars may disturb one another as they move in their
courses, it is clear that any serious disturbance of one star by another
must be a rather exceptional event. Obviously we have been right
in regarding the evolution of a star entirely undisturbed by its
neighbors as the normal course of evolution, and we can now see
why the vast majority of stars follow this normal course.

To all appearances, the stars which have been sidetracked off this
normal course are extraordinarily few in number. The total number
of stars in the sky is about equal to the total pepulation of the earth;
the number of known exceptional systems would at most populate
one small town, although, of course, we can scarcely even conjecture
how many exceptional systems there may be which are still un-
known to us. There is no reason for supposing that the sidetracking
influence has in every case been a neighboring star, but the systems
known to be exceptional are sufficiently few to suggest that this may
have been the cause in a large proportion of cases.

The immediate question before us, however, is not that of the
exceptional systems in general, but of our own solar system. Was
it a neighboring star that threw it off the main line of evolutionary
development? Here, for the first time, observational astronomy
denies us any help. Not a single system is known outside our solar
system which resembles it in the least degree. The reason is not
that no such system exists, but that we could not see it if it did.
An astronomer on a distant star observing our system would see
Jupiter as the brightest object after our sun, but the ratio of their
luminosities would be as 300,000,000 to 1. Seen from our nearest
known neighbor in space, Proxima Centauri, the sun would appear
as a first magnitude star, and Jupiter as a star of magnitude 22.2,
the distance between them being at most four seconds of arc. A
star of magnitude 22.2 is still well beyond the range of our largest
telescopes, and would be doubly invisible if it had a first magnitude
star only four seconds away. We must wait for a very great in-
_ crease in the power of our telescopes before there will be any hope of
Seeing systems similar to our own in the sky, even if they exist
no further away from us than Proxima Centauri. Thus it is clear
that our discussion has now left the regions in which observation
can be called upon to make suggestions or to check our conclusions:
henceforth we have theory alcne to guide us.
| Let us start on our quest by noticing that our solar system has

quite clearly marked characteristics. It is no mere jumble of bodies
152 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

looking as though they had fallen together by accident—had it
presented this appearance the problem of its origin might reason-
ably be dismissed as hopeless. Not only has the principal system of
the sun and its planets got clearly marked characteristics, but also
these same characteristics reappear in the smaller systems formed
by Jupiter and Saturn, each with its family of satellites. Hach of
these small systems is, to all intents and purposes, a replica in minia-
ture of the solar system, so much so that no suggested origin for
one system can be regarded as satisfactory unless at the same time
it explains the origin of the other two. The principal features com-
mon to the three systems are, that the orbits in all three systems are
with few exceptions, all in or close to one plane, that these orbits
are all described in the same direction, and that the masses of the
secondaries, whether planets or satellites, are all small in compari-
son with those of the primaries around which they revolve. Thus
the sun has a mass equal to 1,047 times that of his greatest planet,
Jupiter, while Jupiter’s mass is about 11,000 times that of his most
massive satellite. The smallest disparity in mass is found in our
own Earth-Moon system with a mass ratio of 81 to 1. In systems
possessing many satellites (those of the Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn)
there is a general tendency for the masses to increase up to a maxi-
mum as we pass outward through the system, and then to decrease
to a minimum. Thus in the main system there is a regular progres-
sion through Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars to the maximum mass of
Jupiter, broken only by the anomalous position of Mars, while on
the descending side the progression through Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
Neptune fails in regularity only through Neptune being some few
per cent more massive than Uranus.

The main line of evolutionary progress has been supposed to be
that of a mass of shrinking, rotating matter—first gaseous, then liq-
uid, then solid—left to itself in space. Such a system must show
one very marked characteristic throughout its whole career, namely,
a plane of symmetry. In its earliest stage of all, when the system
is a mere chaos of independent molecules, the plane will coincide
with what mathematicians describe as the “invariable plane” of
the system. Later, when the mass has assumed the regular shape of
a rotating nebula, the plane is the equatorial plane of the nebula, the
plane in which the arms subsequently appear and in which the stellar
condensations start off in their orbits. The symmetry of spiral
nebule about their equatorial planes would of itself suggest strongly
that they have developed to their present formations as rotating
bodies practically undisturbed by external influences.

If our solar system had developed out of an undisturbed rotat-
ing mass, it, too, ought to exhibit a plane of symmetry. The orbits
of nearly all the planets and their satellites do, in actual fact, lie
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 153

very nearly in one plane, which, to this extent, is, of course, a plane
of symmetry. But the sun’s axis of rotation is not perpendicular
to this plane; the sun has its own plane of symmetry in its equator,
and this is inclined at an angle of 7° to the plane of orbits.

The existence of these two distinct planes is enough in itself to
suggest that our system has not developed simply out of an undis-
turbed rotating mass. Thus, in tracing our system back to its origin,
we naturally look at the effects to be expected from rotation plus
some external influence. To a first rough approximation, it is
natural to suppose that the plane of the sun’s equator records the
plane of rotation of the original system, while the plane of the plan-
etary orbits was in some way determined by the extraneous disturb-
ance.

Of all the interactions between two separate astronomical bodies,
gravitational attraction is likely to be by far the most potent. The
moon has been accused of exerting all kinds of influences on our
earth, as, for example, on its weather, on the destinies, the emotions,
and even on the sanity of its inhabitants; but the only influence
which survives scientific examination is gravitational attraction as
evidenced by the semidiurnal tides. It is true that a head-on colli-
sion between two astronomical bodies would produce more imme-
diately dramatic results than a mere tidal pull; but we shall not
consider such an event here. Head-on collisions must of necessity
be exceedingly rare; systems that experience them would undoubt-
edly be deflected from the main line of evolutionary progress on to
a branch line; but it does not seem likely that this branch line con-
tains systems like our own. As time does not permit the explora-
tion of all conceivable branch lines, let us turn at once to that which
seems most likely to reveal the origin of our system—the branch
line that diverges from the main line at the occurrence of a violent
tidal encounter.

On the earth, our moon raises tides the average height of which
at high tide is only a few feet. This height of high tide is only
about a ten-millionth part of the earth’s radius, a fraction which we
may designate as the tidal fraction. If the moon were ten times as
massive, the tidal fraction would be increased tenfold; if it were
brought to half its present distance, the tidal fraction would be in-
creased eightfold. If we agree to measure masses in terms of the
body on which the tide is raised as unity and to measure lengths
in terms of the radius of the same body, then the tidal fraction is
equal to the mass of the tide-generating body divided by the cube
of its distance, say M/R*. Using this formula, we find that our
nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri, raises on the sun a tide of
quite infinitesimal magnitude; the tidal fraction is about 10-*, and
the actual height of tide is of the order of 10% em., or, say, one-
154 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

fiftieth of the radius of an electron. This single illustration will
show, and with some margin to spare, that under normal conditions
the tidal influence between neighboring stars is utterly insignificant.
For tidal forces to become important to cosmogony, conditions
must be abnormal.

Our sun happens at the present moment to have no especially near
neighbor; but it is fairly certain that at some time, in its wander-
ings through the stars, it must have passed stars within a much
less distance than that which now separates it from Proxima Cen-
tauri. The most trustworthy lines of evidence as to the earth’s age,
namely, those from geology and radioactivity, indicate an age of
from 800 to 1,100 million years. For precision, let us think of the
sun’s age as 1,000 million years. Let us imagine for the moment,
what is no doubt very far from the truth, that throughout all this
thousand million years the sun and all the stars have moved just
as they are moving now, with the same average velocities as now, and
keeping at the same average distance apart. Throughout this thou-
sand million years the distance of our sun from its nearest neighbor
will have been continually changing, and one star after another will,
of course, have taken up the réle of nearest neighbor. But there
must have been some one instant in this thousand million years at
which our sun was nearer than at any other instant to its nearest
neighbor. A calculation based on the theory of probability indicates
that this nearest distance is likely to have been of the order of
7X10** em., a distance which, although only a six-hundredth of that
which now separates us from Proxima Centauri, is still equal to
fifteen times the radius of Neptune’s orbit. Even if the sun had
filled the whole of Neptune’s orbit, the tidal fraction at this closest
encounter, on the supposition that the nearest star had a mass equal
to the sun, would only be equal to 1/(15)* or 1/3375, giving a height
of tide which is quite unimportant from the point of view of cos-
mogony. So long as things have been as they now are, tidal actions
between separate stars must have been quite devoid of cosmogonic
interest, except possibly in very special cases of quite exceptionally
close approaches.

It is, of course, possible that our sun was the victim of one of
those exceptionally close encounters. Nothing can be brought against
the supposition of such an event, except its a pricri improbability.
The result of such a close encounter might, as we shall see, be the
creation of a system in many ways resembling our solar system.

Our calculations of probabilities and improbabilities have, how-
ever, rested upon the admittedly errcneous assumption that stellar
conditions have been similar to the present ones for a period of
a thousand million years. On looking back through the past history
of the universe, we come to a time when conditions must have been
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS H55

very different from what they are now. We come to a time, which
we have already considered, when our sun had not yet assumed its
present stellar characteristics. It was a condensation in the arm of
a spiral nebula moving with thousands of similar condensations
towards a free career in space. Its density was enormously lower
than it now is, and its size correspondingly greater. It was also
much nearer to its neighbors than, in all probability, it has ever
been since. In this early stage of its existence, the tidal effects of
its neighbors may well have been enormous; we shall pass to exact
figures in a moment.

In general, the passage of one star past another merely raises a
tide which subsides as the tide-raising body recedes. Even when the
approach is so close that the height of the tide raised is greater than
the original radius of the star, the recession of the disturbing star
may result in the disturbed star relapsing merely to its original
spherical form. But there is a limit which must not be passed, and
if the disturbing body passes this limit, all hope of the star resuming
its original shape is lost. The distance of the limit depends pri-
marily on the mass of the disturber; to a lesser degree it depends on
the rotation, shape, and density-distribution of the primary star;
and to some extent it depends on the velocity of the two stars rela-
tive to one another. We shall get a tolerable idea of the march of
events if we suppose the primary star to be surrounded by an imag-
inary sphere the radius of which depends solely on the mass of the
disturbing star. If this mass is equal to the mass of the primary, the
radius of this imaginary sphere will be about 214 times the radius of
the primary; if the disturbing star has 8 times the mass of the pri-
mary, the radius of the imaginary sphere will be 414 times that of
the primary, and so on. So long as the center of the visiting star
remains outside the sphere, a tide is raised which recedes as the visit-
ing star disappears, but the moment the visiting star invades this
sphere an entirely new phenomenon appears.

As the approach of the disturber raises the tide to higher and
higher levels, the highest points of the tide move ever farther away
from the star’s center into regions where the gravitational attraction
of the star gets weaker and weaker. At the same time, of course, the
gravitational pull of the visiting star gets stronger and stronger.
Finally, just as the visiting star crosses the critical sphere, its gravi-
tational pull just balances that of the primary—it is this condition
that defines the critical sphere. If the visiting star further invades
this critical sphere, the particles at high tide are shot away from the
primary star, the resultant gravitational force on them now being
definitely toward the visiting star; they are, of course, immediately
replaced by others, which are shot off in turn, and so on. The total
effect is that a filament or jet of gas is shot out from the point of
156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

high tide. Each particle of this jet moves under the combined forces
of the primary and of the visiting star, and the problem of determin-
ing its orbit is a special case of the problem of three bodies, which
unfortunately is not soluble. But the general result is that the jet
undergoes various contortions while moving all the time in the plane
which contains the orbit of the visiting star.

If such a jet had been thrown off the sun simply by an increase of
rotation consequent on shrinkage, its gravitational attraction would,
as we have seen, be inadequate to resist the expansive effect of its own
gas pressure, and it would have been rapidly dissipated away into
space. In the present situation conditions are very different, the
essential difference being that, while shrinkage from loss of radiation
is a very slow process, tidal disruption may be a very rapid process.
The rate of a star’s rotation will alter but slightly in a thousand
years, whereas 10 years may suffice for a tide-raising body to come,
do its work, and go away again. The filament of gas set free by
increase of rotation would be of extreme tenuity; a filament set free
by a tidal cataclysm might easily be of sufficient substance for its
own gravitation to hold it together as a compact whole.

If gravitation is potent enough to do this, it will also be potent
enough to break up the filament into condensations, just as the fila-
ments of spiral nebule are broken up into condensations. But here
again an essential difference must be taken into account. The shrink-
age of a spiral nebula is a slow secular process. Year after year and
century after century the filament will be ejected without change of
character—the process may be compared to the paying out of a coil
of rope. But the tidal disruption of a star is a rapid, even cataclys-
mic event; within a few years the emission of the filament starts,
reaches a maximum, declines, and ends. There is no steady paying
out here; the process ought rather to be compared to the discharge of
a torpedo, or other body which is thickest in the middle and tapers
off at the two ends. When a filament of this shape breaks up into
condensations it will form no long chain of similar masses, but a
small number of unequal masses. It is natural to conjecture a priori
that large masses are likely to form out of the central portions where
matter is most plentiful, and smaller masses at the ends where matter
is scarce. Such a question can not, of course, be finally settled by a
priori conjectures, but in the present case an exact discussion of the
problem indicates that the a priori view is the right one, and suggests
that the comparative abundance of matter in the central part of the
filament may provide an explanation of the appearance of the more
massive planets, Jupiter and Saturn, near the center of the sequence
of planets.

Obviously, if a tidal cataclysm can explain the existence of the
planets, it can also, in general terms at least, explain the existence of
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 157

the satellites of these planets. For immediately after the birth of
any planet, say Jupiter, the original situation repeats itself in minia-
ture. Jupiter now plays the part originally assigned to the sun,
while either the wandering star or the sun itself, or possibly the com-
bination of the two, acts the part of the tide-raising disturber. Again
we get the emitted filament, again the formation of condensations,
and again, as the ultimate result, a sequence of detached bodies with
the most massive in the middle. Since Jupiter, the sun, and the dis-
turbing star all move in the same plane—namely, the plane of Jupi-
ter’s orbit—it follows that Jupiter’s satellites, when formed, ought
also to move in this plane, as in actual fact they are observed to do.

So long as we merely discuss the matter in general terms it looks
as though the process might go on for generation after generation,
each member of a family of satellites producing minor satellites to
circle round itself, and so on ad infinitum. Common sense suggests
that this can not go on forever; there must be a limit somewhere.
Exact calculation confirms the view of common-sense, with the dis-
concerting addition, that we are in danger of overstepping the limit
if we attempt to account for the whole of the satellites in the solar
system in the way just suggested.

I have already mentioned a mathematical formula which enables
us to calculate the masses of the bodies formed out of the condensa-
tions in the arms of spiral nebule. The same formula puts us in a
position to calculate the’ masses of the planets which ought to be
formed from the filament drawn out of the sun. Let us suppose that
when the tidal cataclysm took place the sun had a radius equal to
that of Neptune’s orbit, and therefore a mean density of 5.5107.
Let us suppose that at the middle parts of the ejected filament the
mean density was one-tenth of this, or 5.510%. Let us further
suppose that the temperature of the ejected matter corresponded to a

molecular velocity 410‘, this being about the molecular velocity of
hydrogen or oxygen at their ordinary boiling points. Then our

formula indicates that the masses of the planets formed out of the
middle parts of the filament ought to be about 10°° gm., a mass inter-
mediate between those of Jupiter and Saturn. This is satisfactory as
showing that there is no numerical difficulty in supposing Jupiter
and Saturn to have come into being in the way we have imagined.
If we like to accept the tidal theory of their birth, we can reverse
our calculation and can calculate from their present known masses
what must have been the density of the matter from which they were
formed.

Naturally an inverted calculation of this kind is not applicable
only to Jupiter and Saturn; if the tidal hypothesis is correct it must
be applicable to all the planets and to all their satellites. For ex-
ample, the first five satellites of Saturn all have masses of about

20397—25——_12
158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

5><10*° gm.; our calculation shows that if these satellites came into
being as gaseous condensations in a filament, the gas in this filament
must have been anything from one to a million times as dense as
lead. Such a conclusion is, of course, preposterous. The only proper
conclusion is that these satellites can not have originated as gaseous
condensations.

This conclusion is not surprising, or even unexpected. Even now
these satellites, on account of the smallness of their mass, are in-
capable of retaining a gaseous atmosphere, whence it follows that
they can never have existed in the gaseous state. They must have
been born either liquid or solid.

In this way we come upon the practical limitation to the possibil-
ity of endless generations of satellites being born. Primarily it is
that after a time the satellites would be too small for their gravita-
tion to hold them together. A brief reprieve from the operation of
this law is afforded by the possibility of the matter liquefying or
even solidifying before it scatters into space, and it is probably
owing to the operation of this reprieve that all the satellites of the
planets, and probably also the smaller planets themselves, owe their
existence.

What of our earth, which interests us above all other planets? Its
present mass is rather too small to have been born out of a purely
gaseous filament, but we must remember that if it were born gaseous
a large part of its mass might be immediately dissipated away into
space, the present earth representing only a remnant of a once much
more massive planet. This line of investigation leads nowhere. A
more promising line of attack is through a consideration of our satel-
lite, the moon. The more liquid a planet was at its birth the less
likely was it to be broken up tidally by the still gaseous sun, but, in
the event of this breaking up taking place, the ratio of mass between
satellite and primary would be much nearer to unity than in the case
of a wholly gaseous planet. Thus, as we pass from planets which
were wholly gaseous at birth to planets which were wholly liquid, we
ought to start from planets with large numbers of relatively small
satellites, and after passing through the boundary cases of planets
with a small number of relatively large satellites reach planets hav-
ing no satellites at all. This is precisely what we find in the solar
system. Leaving Jupiter and Saturn, each with their nine relatively
small satellites, we pass through Mars, with its two satellites, to the
earth, with one relatively very large satellite, and after this come to
Venus and Mercury, with no satellites at all. Proceeding in the
other direction from Jupiter and Saturn, we pass through Uranus,
with four small satellites, to Neptune, with one comparatively big
satellite. Looked at from this point of view, the earth-moon system
figures as the obvious boundary case between the planets which were
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 159

originally liquid and those which were originally gaseous, the cor-
responding boundary case on the other half of the chain being Nep-
tune. Thus we can conjecture that Mercury and Venus were born
liquid or solid, that the earth and Neptune were born partly liquid
and partly gaseous, and that Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus were
born gaseous.

We have already noticed that Mars and Uranus both have masses
which are too small for their positions in the sequence of planets. If
the planets were born out of a filament of continuously varying
density, the mass of Mars at birth ought to have been intermediate
between that of the earth and that of Jupiter, and similarly the mass
of Uranus at birth ought to have been intermediate between that of
Neptune and that of Saturn. We have, however, just seen reasons
for conjecturing that the two anomalous planets, Mars and Uranus,
were the two smallest planets to be born in the gaseous state; they
would, therefore, be likely to lose more mass by dissipation of their
outer layers than any of the other planets. Let us introduce the sup-
position that Mars, and to a lesser degree Uranus, lost large parts of
their mass by dissipation into space; let us suppose that they are
mere fragments of what were originally much more massive planets,
then all anomalies disappear, and the pieces of the puzzle begin to
fit together in a very gratifying manner.

Nevertheless, and in spite of the high promise which the tidal
theory seems to hold out, it is far too early to claim that it can finally
explain the origin of our system. Its claim to consideration at pres-
ent is rather that, so far as I know, it provides the only theory of
that origin which is not open to obvious and insuperable objections.

THE ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER’

By Prof. Sir Ernest RuTHERFORD, D. Se.. LL. D., Ph. D., F. R. S.

It was in 1896 that this association last met in Liverpool, under
the presidency of the late Lord Lister, that great pioneer in antisep-
tic surgery, whose memory is held in affectionate remembrance by
all nations. His address, which dealt mainky with the history of
the application of antiseptic methods to surgery and its connection
with the work of Pasteur, that prince of experimenters, whose birth
has been so fittingly celebrated this year, gave us in a sense a com-
pleted page of brilliant scientific history. At the same time, in his
opening remarks, Lister emphasized the importance of the discovery
by Réntgen of a new type of radiation, the X rays, which we now
see marked the beginning of a new and fruitful era in another
branch of the science.

The visit to your city in 1896 was for me a memorable occasion, for
it was here that I first attended a meeting of this association, and
hear that I read my first scientific paper. But of much more impor-
tance, it was here that I benefited by the opportunity, which these
gatherings so amply afford, of meeting for the first time many of the
distinguished scientific men of this country and the foreign repre-
sentatives of science who were the guests of this city on that oc-
casion. The year 1896 has always seemed to me a memorable one for
other reasons, for on looking back with some sense of perspective
we can not fail to recognize that the last Liverpool meeting marked
the beginning of what has been aptly termed the heroic age of phys-
ical science. Never before in the history of physics has there been
witnessed such a period of intense activity when discoveries of
fundamental importance have followed one another with such
bewildering rapidity.

The discovery of X rays by Réntgen had been published to the
world in 1895, while the discovery of the radioactivity of uranium
by Becquerel was announced early in 1896. Even the most imagina-
tive of our scientific men could never have dreamed at that time of
the extension of our knowledge of the structure of matter that was to

162 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

develop from these two fundamental discoveries, but in the records
of the Liverpool meeting we see the dawning recognition of the pos-
sible consequences of the discovery of X rays, not only in their ap-
plication to medicine and surgery, but as a new and powerful agent
for attacking some of the fundamental problems of physics. The
address of Prof. J. J. Thomson, president of Section A, was devoted
mainly to a discussion of the nature of the X rays, and the remark-
able properties induced in gases by the passage of X rays through
them—the beginning of a new and fruitful branch of study.

In applied physics, too, this year marked the beginning of another
advance. In the discussion of a paper which I had the honor to
read, on a new magnetic detector of electrical waves, the late Sir
William Preece told the meeting of the successful transmission of
signals for a few hundred yards by electrical waves which had been
made in England by a young Italian, G. Marconi. The first public
demonstration of signaling for short distances by electric waves
had been given by Sir Oliver Lodge at the Oxford meeting of this
association in 1894. It is startling to recall the rapidity of the
development from such small beginnings of the new method of
wireless intercommunication over the greatest terrestrial distances.
In the last few years this has been followed by the even more rapid
growth of the allied subject of radiotelephony as a practical means
of broadcasting speech and music to distances only limited by the
power of the transmitting station. The rapidity of these technical
advances is an illustration of the close interconnection that must
exist between pure and applied science if rapid and sure progress
is to be made. The electrical engineer has been able to base his
technical developments on the solid foundation of Maxwell’s electro-
magnetic theory and its complete verification by the researches of
Hertz, and also by the experiments of Sir Oliver Lodge in this uni-
versity—a verification which was completed long before the prac-
tical possibilities of this new method of signaling had been generally
recognized. The later advances in radiotelegraphy and radiotele-
phony have largely depended on the application of the results of
fundamental researches on the properties of electrons, as illustrated
in the use of the thermionic valve or electron tube which has proved
such an invaluable agent both for the transmission and reception of
electric waves.

It is of great interest to note that the benefits of this union of pure
and applied research have not been one-sided. If the fundamental
researches of the workers in pure science supply the foundations on
which the applications are surely built, the successful practical
application in turn quickens and extends the interest of the investi-
gator in the fundamental problem, while the development of new
methods and appliances required for technical purposes often pro-
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—-RUTHERFORD 163

vides the investigator with means of attacking still more difficult
questions. This important reaction between pure and applied
science can be illustrated in many branches of knowledge. It is
particularly manifest in the industrial development of X-ray radio-
graphy for therapeutic and industrial purposes, where the develop-
ment on a large scale of special X-ray tubes and improved methods
of excitation has given the physicist much more efficient tools to carry
out his researches on the nature of the rays themselves and on the
structure of the atom. In this age no one can draw any sharp line
of distinction between the importance of so-called pure and applied
research. Both are equally essential to progress, and we can not
but recognize that without flourishing schools of research on funda-
mental matters in our universities and scientific institutions technical
research must tend to wither. Fortunately there is little need to
labor this point at the moment, for the importance of a training in
pure research has been generally recognized. The Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research has made a generous provision
of grants to train qualified young men of promise in research
methods in our scientific institutions, and has aided special funda-
mental researches which are clearly beyond the capacity of a labora-
tory to finance from its own funds. Those who have the responsi-
bility of administering the grants in aid of research, both for pure
and applied science, will need all their wisdom and experience to
make a wise allocation of funds to secure the maximum of results
for the minimum of expenditure. It is fatally easy to spend much
money in direct frontal attack on some technical problem of im-
portance when the solution may depend on some addition to know-
ledge which can be gained in some other field of scientific inquiry
possibly at a trifling cost. It is not in any sense my purpose to
eriticize those bodies which administer funds for fostering pure and
applied research, but to emphasize how difficult it is to strike the
correct balance between the expenditure on pure and applied science
in order to achieve the best results in the long run.

It is my intention this evening to refer very briefly to some of
the main features of that great advance in knowledge of the nature
of electricity and matter which is one of the salient features of the
interval since the last meeting of this association in Liverpool.

In order to view the extensive territory which has been conquered
by science in this interval, it is desirable to give a brief summary
of the state of knowledge of the constitution of matter at the be-
ginning of this epoch. Ever since its announcement by Dalton the
atomic theory has steadily gained ground, and formed the philo-
sophic basis for the explanation of the facts of chemical combina-
tion. In the early stages of its application to physics and chemis-
try it was unnecessary to have any detailed knowledge of the di-
164 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

mensions or structure of the atom. It was only necessary to assume
that the atoms acted as individual units, and to know the relative
masses of the atoms of the different elements. In the next stage,
for example, in the kinetic theory of gases, it was possible to explain
the main properties of gases by supposing that the atoms of the
gas acted as minute perfectly elastic spheres. During this period,
by the application of a variety of methods, many of which were due
to Lord Kelvin, rough estimates had been obtained of the absolute
dimensions and mass of the atoms. These brought out the minute
size and mass of the atom and the enormous number of atoms neces-
sary to produce a detectable effect in any kind of measurement.
From this arose the general idea that the atomic theory must of
necessity forever remain unverifiable by direct experiment, and for
this reason it was suggested by one school of thought that the
atomic theory should be banished from the teaching of chemistry,
and that the law of multiple proportions should be accepted as the
ultimate fact of chemistry.

While the vaguest ideas were held as to the possible structure of
atoms, there was a general belief among the more philosophically
minded that the atoms of the elements could not be regarded as
simple unconnected units. The periodic variations of the properties
of the elements brought out by Mendeleeff were only explicable if
atoms were similar structures in some way constructed of similar
material. We shall see that the problem of the constitution of
atoms is intimately connected with our conception of the nature of
electricity. The wonderful success of the electromagnetic theory
had concentrated attention on the medium or ether surrounding the
conductor of electricity, and little attention had been paid to the ac-
tual carriers of the electric current itself. At the same time the
idea was generally gaining ground that an explanation of the re-
sults of Faraday’s experiments on electrolysis was only possible on
the assumption that electricity, like matter, was atomic in nature.

The name “electron” had even been given to this fundamental
unit by Johnstone Stoney, and its magnitude roughly estimated,
but the full recognition of the significance and importance of this
conception belongs to the new epoch.

For the clarifying of these somewhat vague ideas, the proof in
1897 of the independent existence of the electron as a mobile elec-
trified unit, of mass minute compared with that of the lightest atom,
was of extraordinary importance. It was soon seen that the elec-
tron must be a constituent of all the atoms of matter, and that
optical spectra had their origin in their vibrations. The discovery
of the electron and the proof of its liberation by a variety of
methods from all the atoms of matter was of the utmost signifi-
cance, for it strengthened the view that the electron was probably
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 165

the common unit in the structure of atoms which the periodic va-
riation of the chemical properties had indicated. It gave for the
first time some hope of the success of an attack on that most funda-
mental of all problems—the detailed structure of the atom. In
the early development of this subject science owes much to the work
of Sir J. J. Thomson, both for the boldness of his ideas and for
his ingenuity in developing methods for estimating the number of
electrons in the atom, and of probing its structure. He early took
the view that the atom must be an electrical structure, held together
by electrical forces, and showed in a general way lines of possible
explanation of the variation of physical and chemical properties
of the elements, exemplified in the periodic law.

In the meantime our whole conception of the atom and of the
magnitude of the forces which held it together was revolutionized
by the study of radioactivity. The discovery of radium was a great
step in advance, for it provided the experimenter with powerful
sources of radiation specially suitable for examining the nature of
the characteristic radiations which are emitted by the radioactive
bodies in general. It was soon shown that the atoms of radioactive
matter were undergoing spontaneous transformation, and that the
characteristic radiations emitted, viz, the a, 6, and y rays, were an
accompaniment and consequence of these atomic explosions. The
wonderful succession of changes that occur in uranium, more than
30 in number, was soon disclosed and simply interpreted on the
transformation theory. The radioactive elements provide us for
the first time with a glimpse into Nature’s laboratory and allow us
to watch and study but not control the changes that have their ori-
gin in the heart of the radioactive atoms. These atomic explo-
sions involve energies which are gigantic compared with those in-
volved in any ordinary physical or chemical process. In the ma-
jority of cases an @ particle is expelled at high speed, but in others
a swift electron is ejected often accompanied by a y ray, which is
a very penetrating X ray of high frequency. The proof that the «
particle is a charged helium atom for the first time disclosed the im-
portance of helium as one of the units in the structure of the radio-
active atoms, and probably also in that of the atoms of most of the
ordinary elements. Not only then have the radioactive elements had
the greatest direct influence on natural philosophy, but in subsidiary
ways they have provided us with experimental methods of almost
equal importance. The use of « particles as projectiles with which
to explore the interior of the atom has definitely exhibited its nu-
clear structure, has led to artificial disintegration of certain light
atoms, and promises to yield more information yet as to the actual
structure of the nucleus itself.
166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

The influence of radioactivity has also extended to yet another field
of study of fascinating interest. We have seen that the first rough
estimates of the size and mass of the atom gave little hope that we
could detect the effect of a single atom. The discovery that the radio-
active bodies expel actual charged atoms of helium with enormous
energy altered this aspect of the problem. The energy associated
with a single « particle is so great that it can readily be detected by
a variety of methods. Each «@ particle, as Sir William Crookes first
showed, produces a flash of light easily visible in a dark room when
it falls on a screen coated with crystals of zine sulphide. This scin-
tillation method of counting individual particles has proved invalu-
able in many researches, for it gives us a method of unequaled deli-
cacy for studying the effects of single atoms. The a particle can also
be detected electrically or photographically, but the most powerful
and beautiful of all methods is that perfected by Mr. C. T. R. Wilson
for observing the track through a gas not only of an a particle but
of any type of penetrating radiation which produces ions or of elec-
trified particles along its path. The method is comparatively simple,
depending on the fact, first discovered by him, that if a gas saturated
with moisture is suddenly cooled each of the ions produced by the
radiation becomes the nucleus of a visible drop of water. The water-
drops along the track of the « particle are clearly visible to the eye,
and can be recorded photographically. These beautiful photographs
of the effect produced by single atoms or single electrons appeal, I
think, greatly to all scientific men. They not only afford convincing
evidence of the discrete nature of these particles, but give us new
courage and confidence that the scientific methods of experiment
and deduction are to be relied upon in this field of inquiry; for
many of the essential points brought out so clearly and concretely in
these photographs were correctly deduced long before such confirma-
tory photographs were available. At the same time, a minute study
of the detail disclosed in these photographs gives us most valuable
information and new clues on many recondite effects produced by the
passage through matter of these flying projectiles and penetrating
radiations.

In the meantime a number of new methods had been devised to fix
with some accuracy the mass of the individual atom and the number
in any given quantity of matter. The concordant results obtained by
widely different physical principles gave great confidence in the
correctness of the atomic idea of matter. The method found capable
of most accuracy depends on the definite proof of the atomic nature
of electricity and the exact valuation of this fundamental unit of
charge. We have seen that it was early surmised that electricity was
atomic in nature. This view was confirmed and extended by a study
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 167

of the charges carried by electrons, « particles, and the ions produced
in gases by X rays and the rays from radioactive matter. It wa
first shown by Townsend that the positive or negative charge carried
by an ion in gases was invariably equal to the charge carried by the
hydrogen ion in the electrolysis of water, which we have seen was
assumed, and assumed correctly, by Johnstone Stoney to be the
fundamental unit of charge. Various methods were devised to
measure the magnitude of this fundamental unit; the best known and
most accurate is that used by Millikan, which depends on comparing
the pull of an electric field on a charged droplet of oil or mercury
with the weight of the drop. His experiments gave a most convinc-
ing proof of the correctness’ of the electronic theory, and gave a
measure of this unit, the most fundamental of all physical units,
with an accuracy of about one in a thousand. Knowing this value,
we can by the aid of electrochemical data easily deduce the mass of
the individual atoms and the number of molecules in a cubic centi-
meter of any gas with an accuracy of possibly one in a thousand,
but certainly better than one in a hundred. When we consider the
minuteness of the unit of electricity and of the mass of the atom this
experimental achievement is one of the most notable even in an era of
great advances.

The idea of the atomic nature of electricity is very closely connected
with the attack on the problem of the structure of the atom. If the
atom is an electrical structure it can only contain an integral number
of charged units, and, since it is ordinarily neutral, the number of
units of positive charge must equal the number of negative. One
of the main difficulties in this problem has been the uncertainty as to
the relative part played by positive and negative electricity in the
structure of the atom. We know that the electron has a negative
charge of one fundamental unit, while the charged hydrogen atom,
whether in electrolysis or in the electric discharge, has a charge of
one positive unit. But the mass of the electron is only 1/1840 of the
mass of the hydrogen atom, and though an extensive search has been
made, not the slightest evidence has been found of the existence of
a positive electron of small mass like the negative. In no case has
a positive charge been found associated with a mass less than that
of the charged atom of hydrogen. This difference between positive
and negative electricity is at first sight very surprising, but the
deeper we pursue our inquiries the more this fundamental difference
between the units of positive and negative electricity is emphasized.
In fact, as we shall see later, the atoms are quite unsymmetrical struc-
tures with regard to the positive and negative units contained in
them, and indeed it seems certain that if there were not this difference
in mass between the two units, matter, as we know it, could not exist.
168 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

It is natural to inquire what explanation can be given of this
striking difference in mass of the two units. I think all scientific men
are convinced that the small mass of the negative electron is to be
entirely associated with the energy of its electrical structure, so that
the electron may be regarded as a disembodied atom of negative
electricity. We know that an electron in motion, in addition to pos-
sessing an electric field, also generates a magnetic field around it,
and energy in the electromagnetic form is stored in the medium and
moves with it. This gives the electron an apparent or electrical
mass, which, while nearly constant for slow speeds, increases rapidly
as its velocity approaches that of light. This increase of mass is in
good accord with calculation, whether based on the ordinary electrical
theory or on the theory of relativity. Now we know that the hydro-
gen atom is the lightest of all atoms, and is presumably the simplest
in structure, and that the charged hydrogen atom, which we shall see
is to be regarded as the hydrogen nucleus, carries a unit positive
charge. It is thus natural to suppose that the hydrogen nucleus is the
atom of positive electricity, or positive electron, analogous to the
negative electron, but differing from it in mass. Electrical theory
shows that the mass of a given charge of electricity increases with
the concentration, and the greater mass of the hydrogen nucleus
would be accounted for if its size were much smaller than that of
the electron. Such a conclusion is supported by evidence obtained
from the study of the close collisions of « particles with hydrogen
nuclei. It is found that the hydrogen nucleus must be of minute size,
of radius less than the electron, which is usually supposed to be about
10-2 ems.; also the experimental evidence is not inconsistent with
the view that the hydrogen nucleus may actually be much smaller
than the electron. While the greater mass of the positive atom of
electricity may be explained in this way, we are still left with the
enigma why the two units of electricity should differ so markedly in
this respect. In the present state of our knowledge it does not seem
possible to push this inquiry further or to discuss the problem of the
relation of these two units.

We shall see that there is the strongest evidence that the atoms
of matter are built up of these two electrical units, viz, the electron
and the hydrogen nucleus or proton, as it is usually called when it
forms part of the structure of any atom. It is probable that these
two are the fundamental and indivisible units which build up our
universe, but we may reserve in our mind the possibility that further
inquiry may some day show that these units are complex, and divisible
into even more fundamental entities. On the views we have outlined,
the mass of the atom is the sum of the electrical masses of the indi-
vidual charged units composing its structure, and there is no need to
assume that any other kind of mass exists. At the same time, it is
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 169

to be borne in mind that the actual mass of an atom may be somewhat
less than the sum of the masses of component positive and negative
electrons when in the free state. On account of the very close
proximity of the charged units in the nucleus of an atom, and the
consequent disturbance of the electric and magnetic field surrounding
them, such a decrease of mass is to be anticipated on general theo-
retical grounds.

We must now look back again to the earlier stages of the present
epoch in order to trace the development of our ideas on the detailed
structure of the atom. That electrons as such were important con-
stituents was clear by 1900, but little real progress followed until the
part played by the positive charges was made clear. New light was
thrown on this subject by examining the deviation of « particles
when they passed through the atoms of matter. It was found that
occasionally a swift « particle was deflected from its rectilinear path
through more than a right angle by an encounter with a single
atom. In such a collision the laws of dynamics ordinarily apply,
and the relation between the velocities of the colliding atoms before
and after collision are exactly the same as if the two colliding par-
ticles are regarded as perfectly elastic spheres of minute dimensions.
It must, however, be borne in mind that in these atomic collisions
there is no question of mechanical impacts such as we observe with
ordinary matter. The reaction between the two particles occurs
through the intermediary of the powerful electric fields that sur-
round them. Beautiful photographs illustrating the accuracy of
these laws of collision between an a particle and an atom have been
obtained by Messrs. Wilson, Blackett, and others, while Mr. Wilson
has recently obtained many striking illustrations of collisions be-
tween two electrons. Remembering the great kinetic energy of the
a particle, its deflection through a large angle in a single atomic
encounter shows clearly that very intense deflecting forces exist
inside the atom. It seemed clear that electric fields of the required
magnitude could be obtained only if the main charge of the atom
were concentrated in a minute nucleus. From this arose the con-
ception of the nuclear atom, now so well known, in which the heart
of the atom is supposed to consist of a minute but massive nucleus,
carrying a positive charge of electricity, and surrounded at a dis-
tance by the requisite number of electrons to form a neutral atom.

A detailed study of the scattering of « particles at different angles
by Geiger and Marsden showed that the results were in close accord
with this theory, and that the intense forces near the nucleus
varied according to the ordinary inverse square law. In addition,
the experiments allowed us to fix an upper limit for the dimensions
of the nucleus. For a heavy atom like that of gold the radius of
the nucleus, if supposed to be spherical, was less than one thousandth
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of the radius of the complete atom surrounded by its electrons, and
certainly less than 4 10°" cms. All the atoms were found to show
this nuclear structure, and an approximate estimate was made of the
nuclear charge of different atoms. This type of nuclear atom, based
on direct experimental evidence, possesses some very simple proper-
ties. It is obvious that the number of units of resultant positive
charge in the nucleus fixes the number of the outer planetary elec-
trons in the neutral atom. In addition, since these outer electrons
are in some way held in equilibrium by the attractive forces from
the nucleus, and, since we are confident from general physical and
chemical evidence that all atoms of any one element are identical
in their external structure, it is clear that their arrangement and
motion must be governed entirely by the magnitude of the nuclear
charge. Since the ordinary chemical and physical properties are
to be ascribed mainly to the configuration and motion of the outer
electrons, it follows that the properties of an atom are defined by a
whole number representing its nuclear charge. It thus becomes of
great importance to determine the value of this nuclear charge for
the atoms of all the elements.
Data obtained from the scattering of « particles, and also from
the scattering of X rays by light elements, indicated that the nuclear
charge of an element was numerically equal to about half the atomic
weight in terms of hydrogen. It was fairly clear from general evi-
dence that the hydrogen nucleus had a charge one, and the helium
nucleus (the « particle) a charge two. At this stage another dis-
covery of great importance provided a powerful method of attack
on this problem. The investigation by Laue on the diffraction of
X rays by crystals had shown definitely that X rays were electro-
magnetic waves of much shorter wave-length than light, and the
experiments of Sir William Bragg and W. L. Bragg had provided
simple methods for studying the spectra of a beam of X rays. It
was found that the spectrum in general shows a continuous back-
ground on which is superimposed a spectrum of bright lines. At
this stage H. G. J. Moseley began a research with the intention of
deciding whether the properties of an element depended on its
nuclear charge rather than on its atomic weight as ordinarily sup-
posed. For this purpose the X-ray spectra emitted by a number
of elements were examined and found to be all similar in type.
The frequency of a given line was found to vary very nearly as
the square of a whole number which varied by unity in passing
from one element to the next. Moseley identified this whole num-
ber with the atomic or ordinal number of the elements when ar-
ranged in increasing order of atomic weight, allowance being made
for the known anomalies in the periodic table and for certain gaps
corresponding to possible but missing elements. He concluded that
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 171

the atomic number of an element was a measure of its nuclear
charge, and the correctness of this deduction has been recently veri-
fied by Chadwick by direct experiments on the scattering of «2
particles. Moseley’s discovery is of fundamental importance, for it
not only fixes the number of electrons in all the atoms, but shows
conclusively that the properties of an atom, as had been surmised,
are determined not by its atomic weight but by its nuclear charge.
A relation of unexpected simplicity is thus found to hold between
the elements. No one could have anticipated that with few excep-
tions all atomic numbers between hydrogen 1 and uranium 92 would
correspond to known elements. The great power of Moseley’s law
in fixing the atomic number of an element is well illustrated by the
recent discovery by Coster and Hevesy in Copenhagen of the miss-
ing element of atomic number 72, which they have named
“hafnium.”

Once the salient features of the structure of atoms have been fixed
and the number of electrons known, the further study of the struc-
ture of the atom falls naturally into two great divisions: One, the
arrangement of the outer electrons which controls the main physical
and chemical properties of an element, and the other the structure
of the nucleus on which the mass and radioactivity of the atom de-
pends. On the nuclear theory the hydrogen atom is of extreme sim-
plicity, consisting of a singly-charged positive nucleus with only
one attendant electron. The position and motions of the single elec-
tron must account for the complicated optical spectrum, and what-
ever physical and chemical properties are to be attributed to the
hydrogen atom. The first definite attack on the problem of the
electronic structure of the atom was made by Niels Bohr. He saw
clearly that, if this simple constitution was assumed, it is impossible
to account for the spectrum of hydrogen on the classical electrical
theories, but that a radical departure from existing views was neces-
sary. For this purpose he applied to the atom the essential ideas of
the quantum theory which had been developed by Planck for other
purposes, and had been found of great service in explaining many
fundamental difficulties in other branches of science. On Planck’s
theory radiation is emitted in definite units or quanta, in which the
energy E of a radiation is equal to hy where y is the frequency of
the radiation measured by the ordinary methods and h a universal
constant. This quantum of radiation is not a definite fixed unit like
the atom of electricity, for its magnitude depends on the frequency
of the radiation. For example, the energy of a quantum is small for
visible light, but becomes large for radiation of high frequency cor-
responding to the X rays or the y rays from radium.

Time does not allow me to discuss the underlying meaning of the
quantum theory or the difficulties connected with it. Certain aspects
172 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of the difficulties were discussed in the presidential address before
this association by Sir Oliver Lodge at Birmingham in 1913. It
suffices to say that this theory has proved of great value in several
branches of science, and is supported by a large mass of direct ex-
perimental evidence.

In applying the quantum theory to the structure of the hydrogen
atom Bohr supposed that the single electron could move in a number
of stable orbits, controlled by the attractive force of the nucleus,
without losing energy by radiation. The position and character of
these orbits were defined by certain quantum relations depending
on one or more whole numbers. It was assumed that radiation was
only emitted when the electron for some reason was transferred
from one stable orbit to another of lower energy. In such a case it
was supposed that a homogeneous radiation was emitted of fre-
quency v determined by the quantum relation E=Av where E was
the difference of the energy of the electron in the two orbits. Some
of these possible orbits are circular, others elliptical, with the nucleus
as a focus, while if the change of mass of the electron with velocity
is taken into account the orbits, as Sommerfeld showed, depend on
two quantum numbers, and are not closed, but consist of a nearly
elliptical orbit slowly rotating round the nucleus. In this way it is
possible not only to account for the series relations between the
bright lines of the hydrogen spectrum, but also to explain the fine
structure of the lines and the very complicated changes observed
when the radiating atoms are exposed in a strong magnetic or elec-
tric field. Under ordinary conditions the electron in the hydrogen
atom rotates in a circular orbit close to the nucleus, but if the atoms
are excited by an electric discharge or other suitable method, the
electron may be displaced and occupy any one of the stable positions
specified by the theory. In a radiating gas giving the complete
hydrogen spectrum there will be present many different kinds of
hydrogen atoms, in each of which the electron describes one of the
possible orbits specified by the theory. On this view it is seen that
the variety of modes of vibration of the hydrogen atom is ascribed, not
to complexity of the structure of the atom, but to the variety of stable
orbits which an electron may occupy relative to the nucleus. This
novel theory of the origin of spectra has been developed so as to
apply not only to hydrogen but to all the elements, and has been
instrumental in throwing a flood of light on the relations and origin
of their spectra, both X ray and optical. The information thus
gained has been applied by Bohr to determine the distribution of
the electrons round the nucleus of any atom. The problem is ob-
viously much less complicated for hydrogen than for a heavy atom,
where each of the large number of electrons present acts on the
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 173

other, and where the orbits described are much more intricate than
the orbit of the single electron in hydrogen. Notwithstanding the
great difficulties of such a complicated system of electrons in motion,
it has been possible to fix the quantum numbers that characterize the
motion of each electron, and to form at any rate a rough idea of the
character of the orbit.

These planetary electrons divide themselves up into groups, accord-
ing as their orbits are characterized by one or more equal quantum
numbers. Without going into detail a few examples may be given
to illustrate the conclusions which have been reached. As we have
seen, the first element hydrogen has a nuclear charge off and sf
electron; the second, helium, has a charge 2 and 2 electrons, moving
in coupled orbits on the detailed nature of which there is still some
uncertainty. These two electrons form a definite group, known as
the K group, which is common to all the elements except hydrogen.
For increasing nuclear charge the K group of electrons retain their
characteristics, but move with increasing speed, and approach closer
to the nucleus. As we pass from helium of atomic number 2 to
neon, number 10, a new group of electrons is added consisting of
two subgroups, each of four electrons, together called the L group.
This L group appears in all atoms of higher atomic number, and,
as in the case of the K group, the speed of motion of the electrons
increases, and the size of their orbits diminishes with the atomic
number. When once the L group has been completed a new and still
more complicated M group of electrons begins forming outside it,
and a similar process goes on until uranium, which has the highest
atomic number, is reached.

It may be of interest to try to visualize the conception of the
atom we have so far reached by taking for illustration the heaviest
atom, uranium. At the center of the atom is a minute nucleus sur-
rounded by a swirling group of 92 electrons, all in motion in definite
orbits and occupying but by no means filling a volume very large
compared with that of the nucleus. Some of the electrons describe
nearly circular orbits round the nucleus; others, orbits of a more
elliptical shape whose axes rotate rapidly round the nucleus. The
motion of the electrons in the different groups is not necessarily
confined to a definite region of the atom, but the electrons of one
group may penetrate deeply into the region mainly occupied by
another group, thus giving a type of interconnection or coupling
between the various groups. The maximum speed of any electron
depends on the closeness of the approach to the nucleus, but the
outermost electron will have a minimum speed of more than 1,000
kilometers per second, while the innermost K electrons have an
average speed of more than 150,000 kilometers per second, or half the
174 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

speed of light. When we visualize the extraordinary complexity
of the electronic system we may be surprised that it has been pos-
sible to find any order in the apparent medley of motions.

In reaching these conclusions, which we owe largely to Professor
Bohr and his coworkers, every available kind of data about the
different atoms has been taken into consideration. A study of the
X-ray spectra, in particular, affords information of great value as
to the arrangement of the various groups in the atom, while the
optical spectrum and general chemical properties are of great im-
portance in deciding the arrangements of the superticial electrons.
While the solution of the grouping of the electrons proposed by
Bohr has been assisted by considerations of this kind, it is not em-
pirical in character, but has been largely based on general theoretical
considerations of the orbits of electrons that are physically possible
on the generalized quantum theory. The real problem involved may
be illustrated in the following way. Suppose the gold nucleus be in
some way stripped of its attendant 79 electrons and that the atom
is reconstituted by the successive addition of electrons one by one.
According to Bohr the atom will be reorganized in one way only,
and one group after another will successively form and be filled
up in the manner outlined. The nucleus atom has often been likened
to a solar system where the sun corresponds to the nucleus and the
planets to the electrons. The analogy, however, must not be pressed
too far. Suppose, for example, we imagined that some large and
swift celestial visitor traverses and escapes from our solar system
without any catastrophe to itself or the planets. There will in-
evitably result permanent changes in the lengths of the month and
year, and our system will never return to its original state. Con-
trast this with the effect of shooting an electron or a particle through
the electronic structure of the atom. The motion of many of the
electrons will be disturbed by its passage, and in special cases an
electron may be removed from its orbit and hurled out of its atomic
system. In a short time another electron will fall into the vacant
place from one of the outer groups, and this vacant place in tur
will be filled up, and so on until the atom is again reorganized. In
all cases the final state of the electronic system is the same as in the
beginning. This illustration also serves to indicate the origin of
the X rays excited in the atom, for these arise in the process of
reformation of an atom from which an electron has been ejected,
and the radiation of highest frequency arises when the electron is
removed from the K group.

It is possibly too soon to express a final opinion on the accuracy of
this theory which defines the outer structure of the atom, but there
can be no doubt that it constitutes a great advance. Not only does
it offer a general explanation of the optical and X-ray spectra of the
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD “TS

atom but it accounts in detail for many of the most characteristic
features of the periodic law of Mendeleeff. It gives us for the first
time a clear idea of the reason for the appearance in the family of
elements of groups of consecutive elements with similar chemical
properties, such as the groups analogous to the iron group and the
unique group of rare earths. The theory of Bohr, like all living
theories, has not only correlated a multitude of isolated facts known
about the atom, but has shown its power to predict new relations
which can be verified by experiment. For example, the theory
predicted the relations which must subsist between the Rydberg
constants of the arc and spark spectra, and generally between all
the successive optical spectra of an element, a prediction so strik-
ingly confirmed by Paschen’s work on the spectrum of doubly
ionized aluminium and Fowler’s work on the spectrum of trebly
ionized silicon. Finally it predicted with such great confidence the
chemical properties of the missing element, number 72, that it gave
the necessary incentive for its recent discovery.

While the progress of our knowledge of-the outer structure of
atoms has been much more rapid than could have been anticipated,
we clearly see that only a beginning has been made on this great
problem, and that an enormous amount of work is still required
before we can hope to form anything like a complete picture even
of the outer structure of the atom. We may be confident that the
main features of the structure are clear, but in a problem of such
great complexity progress in detail must of necessity be difficult
and slow.

We have not so far referred to the very difficult question of the
explanation on this theory of the chemical combination of atoms.
In fact, as yet the theory has hardly concerned itself with mole-
cular structure. On the chemical side, however, certain advances
have already been made, notably by G. N. Lewis, Kossel, and Lang-
muir, in the interpretation of the chemical evidence by the idea of
shared electrons, which play a part in the electronic structure of
two combined atoms. There can be little doubt that the next decade
will see an intensified attack by physicists and chemists on this very
important but undoubtedly very complicated question.

Before leaving this subject, it may be of interest to refer to cer-
tain points in Bohr’s theory of a more philosophical nature. It is
seen that the orbits and energies of the various groups of electrons
can be specified by certain quantum numbers and the nature of the
radiation associated with a change of orbit can be defined. But at the
same time we can not explain why these orbits are alone permissible
under normal conditions, or understand the mechanism by which ra-
diation is emitted. It may be quite possible to formulate accurately
the energy relation of the electrons in the atom on a simple theory,
176 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924 ~

and to explain in considerable detail all the properties of an atom,
without any clear understanding of the underlying processes which
lead to these results. It is natural to hope that with advance of
knowledge we may be able to grasp the details of the process which
leads to the emission of radiation, and to understand why the orbits
of the electrons in the atom are defined by the quantum relations.
Some, however, are inclined to take the view that in the present
state of knowledge it may be quite impossible in the nature of
things to form that detailed picture in space and time of succes-
sive events that we have been accustomed to consider as so import-
ant a part of a complete theory. The atom is naturally the most
fundamental structure presented to us. Its properties must explain
the properties of all more complicated structures, including matter
in bulk, but we may not, therefore, be justified in expecting that
its processes can be explained in terms of concepts derived entirely
from a study of molar properties. The atomic processes involved
may be so fundamental that a complete understanding may be
denied us. It is early yet to be pessimistic on this question, for
we may hope that our difficulties may any day be resolved by further
discoveries.

We must now turn our attention to that new and comparatively
unexplored territory, the nucleus of the atom. In a discussion on
the structure of the atom ten years ago, in answer to a question on
the structure of the nucleus, I was rash enough to say that it was
a problem that might well be left to the next generation, for at that
time there seemed to be few obvious methods of attack to throw light
on its constitution. While much more progress has been made
than appeared possible at that time, the problem of the structure
of the nucleus is inherently more difficult than the allied problem
already considered of the structure of the outer atom, where we
have a wealth of information obtained from the study of light
and X-ray spectra and from the chemical properties to test the
accuracy of our theories.

In the case of the nucleus, we know its resultant charge, fixed by
Moseley’s law, and its mass, which is very nearly equal to the mass
of the whole atom, since the mass of the planetary electrons is rela-
tively very small and may for most purposes be neglected. We
know that the nucleus is of size minute compared with that of the
whole atom, and can with some confidence set a maximum limit to
its size. The study of radioactive bodies has provided us with very
valuable information on the structure of the nucleus, for we know
that the « and @ particles must be expelled from it, and there is
strong evidence that the very penetrating y rays represent modes of
vibration of the electrons contained in its structure. In the long
series of transformations which occur in the uranium atom, eight

Se
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 177

a particles are emitted and six electrons, and it seems clear that the
nucleus of a heavy atom is built up, in part at least, of helium
nuclei and electrons. It is natural to suppose that many of the
ordinary stable atoms are constituted in a similar way. It is a
matter of remark that no indication has been, obtained that the
lightest nucleus, viz, that of hydrogen, is liberated in these trans-
formations, where the processes occurring are of so fundamental a
character. At the same time, it is evident that the hydrogen nucleus
must be a unit in the structure of some atoms, and this has been
confirmed by direct experiment. Mr. Chadwick and I have ob-
served that swift hydrogen nuclei are released from the elements
boron, nitrogen, flourine, sodium, aluminium, and phosphorus when
they are bombarded by swift « particles, and there is little room
for doubt that these hydrogen nuclei form an essential part of the
nuclear structure. The speed of ejection of these nuclei depends
on the velocity of the @ particle and on the element bombarded.
It is of interest to note that the hydrogen nuclei are liberated in all
directions, but the speed in the backward direction is always some-
what less than in the direction of the « particle. Such a result
receives a simple explanation if we suppose that the hydrogen nuclei
are not built into the main nucleus but exist as satellites probably
in motion round a central core. There can be no doubt that bom-
bardment by « particles has effected a veritable disintegration of the
nuclei of this group of elements. It is significant that the liberation
of hydrogen nuclei only occurs in elements of odd atomic number,
viz, 5, 7, 9, 11, 18, 15, the elements of even number appearing quite
unaffected. For a collision of an « particle to be effective, it must
either pass close to the nucleus or actually penetrate its structure.
The chance of this is excessively small on account of the minute
size of the nucleus. For example, although each individual « par-
ticle will pass through the outer structure of more than 100,000
atoms of aluminium in its path, it is only about one a particle in a
million that gets close enough to the nucleus to effect the liberation
of its hydrogen satellite.

This artificial disintegration of elements by a particles takes place
only on a minute scale, and its observation has only been possible by
the counting of individual swift hydrogen nuclei by the scintilla-
tions they produce in zine sulphide.

These experiments suggest that the hydrogen nucleus or proton
must be one of the fundamental units which build up a nucleus, and
it seems highly probable that the helium nucleus is a secondary
building unit composed of the very close union of four protons and
two electrons. The view that the nuclei of all atoms are ultimately
built up of protons of mass nearly one and of electrons has been
strongly supported and extended by the study of isotopes. It was
178 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

early observed that some of the radioactive elements which showed
distinct radioactive properties were chemically so alike that it was
impossible to effect their separation when mixed together. Similar
elements of this kind were called “isotopes” by Soddy, since they
appeared to occupy the same place in the periodic table. For
example, a number of radioactive elements in the uranium and_
thorium series have been found to have physical and chemical prop-
erties identical with those of ordinary lead, but yet to have atomic
weights differing from ordinary lead, and also distinctive radio-
active properties. The nuclear theory of the atom offers at once a
simple interpretation of the relation between isotopic elements.
Since the chemical properties of an element are controlled by its
nuclear charge and little influenced by its mass, isotopes must cor-
respond to atoms with the same nuclear charge but of different
nuclear mass. Such a view also offers a simple explanation why
the radioactive isotopes show different radioactive properties, for it
is to be anticipated that the stability of a nucleus will be much
influenced by its mass and arrangement.

Our knowledge of isotopes has been widely extended in the last
few years by Aston, who has devised an accurate direct method for
showing the presence of isotopes in the ordinary elements. He has
found that some of the elements are “ pure ”—1. e., consist of atoms
of identical mass—while others contain a mixture of two or more
isotopes. In the case of the isotopic elements, the atomic mass, as
ordinarily measured by the chemist, is a mean value depending on
the atomic masses of the individual isotopes and their relative abun-
dance. These investigations have not only shown clearly that the
number of distinct species of atoms is much greater than was sup-
posed but have brought out a relation between the elements of great
interest and importance. The atomic masses of the isotopes of most
of the elements examined have been found, to an accuracy of about
one in a thousand, to be whole numbers in terms of oxygen, 16. This
indicates that the nuclei are ultimately built up of protons of mass
very nearly one and of electrons. It is natural to suppose that this
building unit is the hydrogen nucleus, but that its average mass in
the complex nucleus is somewhat less than its mass in the free state
owing to the close packing of the charged units in the nuclear struc-
ture. We have already seen that the helium nucleus of mass 4 is
probably a secondary unit of great importance in the building up of
many atoms, and it may be that other simple combinations of pro-
tons and eleetrons of mass 2 and 3 occur in the nucleus, but these
have not been observed in the free state.

While the masses of the majority of the isotopes are nearly whole
numbers, certain cases have been observed by Aston where this rule
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 179

is slightly departed from. Such variations in mass may ultimately
prove of great importance in throwing light on the arrangement and
closeness of packing of the protons and electrons, and for this reason
it is to be hoped that it may soon prove possible to compare atomic
masses of the elements with much greater precision even than at
present. |

While we may be confident that the proton and the electron are the
ultimate units which take part in the building up of all nuclei, and
can deduce with some certainty the number of protons and electrons
in the nuclei of all atoms, we have little, if any, information on the
distribution of these units in the atom or on the nature of the forces
that hold them in equilibrium. While it is known that the law of
the inverse square holds for the electrical forces some distance from
the nucleus, it seems certain that this law breaks down inside the
nucleus. A detailed study of the collisions between « particles and
hydrogen atoms, where the nuclei approach very close to each other,
shows that the forces between nuclei increase ultimately much more
rapidly than is to be expected from the law of the inverse square,
and it may be that new and unexpected forces may come into impor-
tance at the very small distances separating the protons and elec-
trons in the nucleus. Until we gain more information on the nature
and law of variation of the forces inside the nucleus, further prog-
ress on the detailed structure of the nucleus may be difficult. At
the same time, there are still a number of hopeful directions in which
an attack may be made on this most difficult of problems. A detailed
study of the y rays from radioactive bodies may be expected to
yield information as to the motion of the electrons inside the nucleus,
and it may be, as Ellis has suggested, that quantum laws are opera-
tive inside as well as outside the nucleus. From a study of the rela-
tive proportions of the elements in the earth’s crust, Harkins has
shown that elements of even atomic number are much more abundant
than elements of odd number, suggesting a marked difference of
stability in these two classes of elements. It seems probable that
any process of stellar evolution must be intimately connected with
the building up of complex nuclei from simpler ones, and its study
may thus be expected to throw much light on the evolution of the
elements.

The nucleus of a heavy atom is undoubtedly a very complicated
system, and in a sense a world of its own, litile, if at all, influenced by
the ordinary physical and chemical agencies at our command. When
we consider the mass of a nucleus compared with its volume it seems
certain that its density is many billions of times that of our heaviest
element. Yet, if we could form a magnified picture of the nucleus,
we should expect that it would show a discontinuous structure, occu-
180 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

pied but not filled by the minute building units, the protons and
electrons, in ceaseless rapid motion controlled by their mutual forces.

Before leaving this subject it is desirable to say a few words on
the important question of the energy relations involved in the forma-
tion and disintegration of atomic nuclei, first opened up by the study
of radioactivity. For example, it is well known that the total evo-
lution of energy during the complete disintegration of 1 gram of
radium is many millions of times greater than in the complete com-
bustion of an equal weight of coal. It is known that this energy
is initially mostly emitted in the kinetic form of swift « and 8 par-
ticles, and the energy of motion of these bodies is ultimately con-
verted into heat when they are stopped by matter. Since it is be-
lieved that the radioactive elements were analogous in structure to
the ordinary inactive elements the idea naturally arose that the atoms
of all the elements contained a similar concentration of energy, which
would be available for use if only some simple method could be dis-
covered of promoting and controlling their disintegration. This
possibility of obtaining new and cheap sources of energy for prac-
tical purposes was naturally an alluring prospect to the lay and
scientific man alike. It is quite true that, if we were able to hasten
the radioactive processes in uranium and thorium so that the whole
cycle of their disintegration could be confined to a few days instead
of being spread over thousands of millions of years, these elements
would provide very convenient sources of energy on a sufficient scale
to be of considerable practical importance. Unfortunately, although
many experiments have been tried, there is no evidence that the rate
of disintegration of these elements can be altered in the slightest
degree by the most powerful laboratory agencies. With increase in
our knowledge of atomic structure there has been a gradual change
of our point of view on this important question, and there is by no
means the same certainty to-day as a decade ago that the atoms of
an element contain hidden stores of energy. It may be worth while
to spend a few minutes in discussing the reason for this change in
outlook. This can best be illustrated by considering an interesting
analogy between the transformation of a radioactive nucleus and the
changes in the electron arrangement of an ordinary atom. It is now
well known that it is possible by means of electron bombardment or
by appropriate radiation to excite an atom in such a way that one
of its superficial electrons is displaced from its ordinary stable posi-
tion to another temporarily stable position further removed from
the nucleus. This electron in course of time falls back into its old
position, and its potential energy is converted into radiation in the
process. There is some reason for believing that the electron has a
definite average life in the displaced position, and that the chance
of its return to its original position is governed by the laws of proba-

ke. ee
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 181

bility. In some respects an “excited” atom of this kind is thus
analogous to a radioactive atom, but of course the energy released
in the disintegration of a nucleus is of an entirely different order of
magnitude from the energy released by return of the electron in the
excited atom. It may be that the elements, uranium and thorium,
represent the sole survivals in the earth to-day of types of elements
that were common in the long-distant ages, when the atoms now com-
posing the earth were in course of formation. A fraction of the
atoms of uranium and thorium formed at that time has survived
over the long interval on account of their very slow rate of trans-
formation. It is thus possible to regard these atoms as having not
yet completed the cycle of changes which the ordinary atoms have
long since passed through, and that the atoms are still in the “ ex-
cited ” state where the nuclear units have not yet arranged them-
selves in positions of ultimate equilibrium, but still have a surplus
of energy which can only be released in the form of the character-
istic radiation from active matter. On such a view, the presence of
a store of energy ready for release is not a property of all atoms, but
only of a special class of atoms like the radioactive atoms which have
not yet reached the final state for equilibrium.

It may be urged that the artificial disintegration of certain ele-
ments by bombardment with swift « particles gives definite evidence
of a store of energy in some of the ordinary elements, for it is known
that a few of the hydrogen nuclei, released from aluminium, for
example, are expelled with such swiftness that the particle has a
greater individual energy than the @ particle which causes their
liberation. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to give a definite
answer on this point until we know more of the details of this dis-
integration.

On the other hand, another method of attack on this question has
become important during the last few years, based on the compari-
son of the relative masses of the elements. This new point of view
can best be illustrated by a comparison of the atomic masses of
hydrogen and helium. As we have seen, it seems very probable that
helium is not an ultimate unit in the structure of nuclei but is a
very close combination of four hydrogen nuclei and two electrons.
The mass of the helium nucleus, 4.00 in terms of O=16, is con-
siderably less than the mass 4.03 of four hydrogen nuclei. On mod-
ern views there is believed to be a very close connection between
mass and energy, and this loss in mass in the synthesis of the helium
nucleus from hydrogen nuclei indicates that a large amount of
energy in the form of radiation has been released in the building
of the helium nucleus from its components. It is easy to caleu-
late from this loss of mass that the energy set free in forming 1

20397—25——18
182 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

gram of helium is large even compared with that liberated in the
total disintegration of 1 gram of radium. For example, calculation
shows that the energy released in the formation of 1 pound of
helium gas is equivalent to the energy emitted in the complete com-
bustion of about 8,000 tons of pure carbon. It has been suggested by
Eddington and Perrin that it is mainly to this source of energy
that we must look to maintain the heat emission of the sun and
hot stars over long periods of time. Calculations of the loss of
heat from the sun show that this synthesis of helium need only
take place slowly in order to maintain the present rate of radiation
for periods of the order of 1,000 million years. It must be
acknowledged that these arguments are somewhat speculative in
character, for no certain experimental evidence has yet been ob-
tained that helium can be formed from hydrogen.

The evidence of the slow rate of stellar evolution, however, cer-
tainly indicates that the synthesis of helium and perhaps other ele-
ments of higher atomic weight may take place slowly in the in-
terior of hot stars. While in the electric discharge through hydrogen
at low pressure we can easily reproduce the conditions of the in-
terior of the hottest star, as far as regards the energy of motion
of the electrons and hydrogen nuclei, we can not hope to reproduce
that enormous density of radiation which must exist in the interior
of a giant star. For this and other reasons it may be very difficult
or even impossible, to produce helium from hydrogen under labora-
tory conditions.

If this view of the great heat emission in the formation of helium
be correct, it is clear that the helium nucleus is the most stable of
all nuclei, for an amount of energy corresponding to three or four
a particles would be required to disrupt it into its components. In
addition, since the mass of the proton in nuclei is nearly 1.000 in-
stead of its mass 1.0072 in the free state, it follows that much more
energy must be put into the atom than will be liberated by its dis-
integration into its ultimate units. At the same time, if we consider
an atom of oxygen, which may be supposed to be built up of four
helium nuclei as secondary units, the change of mass, if any, in its
synthesis from already formed helium nuclei is so small that we
can not yet be certain whether there will be a gain or loss of energy
by its disintegration into helium nuclei, but in any case we are cer-

tain that the magnitude of the energy will be much less than for —
the synthesis of helium from hydrogen. Our information on this —
subject of energy changes in the formation or disintegration of —
atoms in general is as yet too uncertain and speculative to give any —

decided opinion on future possibilities in this direction, but I have

\
j
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 183

endeavored to outline some of the main arguments which should be
taken into account.

I must now bring to an end my survey—I am afraid all too brief
and inadequate—of this great period of advance in physical science.
In the short time at my disposal it has been impossible for me, even
if I had the knowledge, to refer to the great advances made during
the period under consideration in all branches of pure and applied
science. JI am well aware that in some departments the progress
made may justly compare with that of my own subject. In these
great additions to our knowledge of the structure of matter every
civilized nation has taken an active part, but we may be justly proud
that this country has made many fundamental contributions. With
this country I must properly include our dominions overseas, for
they have not been behindhand in their contributions to this new
knowledge. It is, I am sure, a matter of pride to this country that
the scientific men of our dominions have been responsible for some
of the most fundamental discoveries of this epoch, particularly in
radioactivity.

This tide of advance was continuous from 1896, but there was an
inevitable slackening during the war. It is a matter of good omen
that in the last few years the old rate of progress has not only been
maintained but even intensified, and there appears to be no obvious
sign that this period of great advances has come to an end. There
has never been a time when the enthusiasm of the scientific workers
was greater, or when there was a more hopeful feeling that great
advances were imminent. This feeling is no doubt in part due to
the great improvement during this epoch of the technical methods
of attack, for problems that at one time seemed unattackable are
now seen to be likely to fall before the new methods. In the main
the epoch under consideration has been an age of experiment, where
the experimenter has been the pioneer in the attack on new prob-
lems. At the same time it has been also an age of bold ideas in
theory, as the quantum theory and the theory of relativity so well
illustrate.

I feel it is a great privilege to have witnessed this period, which
may almost be termed the renaissance of physics. It has been of
extraordinary intellectual interest to watch the gradual unfolding of
new ideas and the ever-changing methods of attack on difficult prob-
lems. It has been of great interest, too, to note the comparative sim-
plicity of the ideas that have ultimately emerged. For example, no
one could have anticipated that the general relation between the ele-
ments would prove to be of so simple a character as we now believe
it to be. It is an illustration of the fact that nature appears to work
in a simple way, and that the more fundamental the problem often
184 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924 .

simpler are the conceptions needed for its explanation. The rapid-
ity and certitude of the advance in this epoch have largely depended
on the fact that it has been possible to devise experiments so that few
variables were involved. For example, the study of the structure of
the atom has been much facilitated by the possibility of examining
the effects due to a single atom of matter, or, as in radioactivity or
X rays, of studying processes going on in the individual atom which
were quite uninfluenced by external conditions.

In watching the rapidity of this tide of advance in physics I have
become more and more impressed by the power of the scientific
method of extending our knowledge of nature. Experiment, directed
by the disciplined imagination either of an individual, or still better,
of a group of individuals of varied mental outlook, is able to achieve
results which far transcend the imagination alone of the greatest
natural philosopher. Experiment without imagination, or imagina-
tion without recourse to experiment, can accomplish little, but, for
effective progress, a happy blend of these two powers is necessary.
The unknown appears as a dense mist before the eyes of men. In
penetrating this obscurity we can not invoke the aid of supermen,
but must depend on the combined efforts of a number of adequately
trained ordinary. men of scientific imagination. Each in his own
special field of inquiry is enabled by the scientific method to pene-
trate a short distance, and his work reacts upon and influences the
whole body of other workers. From time to time there arises an
illuminating conception, based on accumulated knowledge, which
lights up a large region and shows the connection between these in-
dividual efforts, so that a general advance follows. The attack
begins anew on a wider front, and often with improved technical
weapons. The conception which led to this advance often appears
simple and obvious when once it has been put forward. This is a
common experience, and the scientific man often feels a sense of dis-
appointment that he himself had not foreseen a development which
ultimately seems so clear and inevitable.
