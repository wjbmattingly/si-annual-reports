REPORT

OF THE

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
Cuar_tes D. WaLcoTT

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1924

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith the customary
annual report showing the activities and conditions of the Smith-
sonian Institution and its branches during the fiscal year ending
June 380, 1924. The first 26 pages of the report contain an ac-
count of the affairs of the Institution proper, with brief abstracts
of the work carried on by the various branches of the Institution,
while appendixes 1 to 10 present somewhat more detailed summaries
of the operations of the United States National Museum, the Na-
tional Gallery of Art, the Freer Gallery of Art, the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology, the International Exchanges, the National Zoologi-
cal Park, the Astrophysical Observatory, the United States Regional
Bureau of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, the
Smithsonian Library, and of the publications of the Institution and
its branches. :

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting
the trust Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and therefore
constituted an “ establishment ” whose statutory members are “ the
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of

the executive departments.”
I
2 _ ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924 8

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The affairs of the Institution are administered by a Board of
Regents whose membership consists of “the Vice President, the
Chief Justice, three Members of the Senate, and three Members of
the House of Representatives, together with six other persons
other than Members of Congress, two of whom shall be resident in
the City of Washington and the other four shall be inhabitants of
some State, but no two of them of the same State.” One of the
Regents is elected chancellor by the board; in the past the selection
has fallen upon the Vice President or the Chief Justice; and a suit-
able person is chosen by them as secretary of the Institution, who
is also secretary of the Board of Regents and the executive officer
directly in charge of the Institution’s activities.

In regard to the personnel of the board, the following changes
occurred during the year: Through his succession to the Presidency
on August 2, 1923, owing to the death of President Harding, the
Hon. Calvin Coolidge automatically ceased to be a Regent, thus
terminating his office as chancellor of the Institution, and to fill
the vacancy thus created, the Hon. William H. Taft was elected
chancellor of the board on December 13, 1923. Walter H. Newton,
Member of the House of Representatives from Minnesota, was ap-
pointed a Regent by the Speaker of the House to fill the vacancy
caused by the election to the Senate of Frank L. Greene.

The roll of Regents at the close of the fiscal year was as follows:
William H. Taft, Chief Justice of the United States, chancellor;
Henry Cabot Lodge, Member of the Senate; Medill McCormick,
Member of the Senate; A. Owsley Stanley, Member of the Senate;
Albert Johnson, Member of the House of Representatives; R. Wal-
ton Moore, Member of the House of Representatives; Walter H.
Newton, Member of the House of Representatives; George Gray,
citizen of Delaware; Charles F. Choate, jr., citizen of Massachu-
setts; Henry White, citizen of Washington, D. C.; Robert S. Brook-
ings, citizen of Missouri; Irwin B. Laughlin, citizen of Pennsyl-
vania; and Frederic A. Delano, citizen of Washington, D. C.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

In spite of the increasing difficulty in holding its own experienced
by the Institution in late years on account of its meager resources
and the increasing costs of maintenance, one of its primary functions,
the “diffusion of knowledge among men,” is carried out with ever-
increasing scope, and its contacts with various groups of people are
continually growing in number. Of its 11 distinct series of publi-
cations, chiefly technical contributions to scientific knowledge though
including some more popular papers appealing to the general reader

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY o

interested in the progress of science, there are issued every year about
100 volumes and pamphlets, of which there are sent out nearly
150,000 copies. A large proportion of this number go to libraries
throughout the world, where they are readily available to the public,
and many of its publications are now standard works in various
branches of science. Besides this steady flow of publications, the
Institution, through the public exhibits of the National Museum,
the National Gallery of Art, and the National Zoological Park,
imparts an incalculable amount of knowledge on natural history,
anthropology, art, and history to the hundreds of thousands of visi-
tors from all parts of the country who come to the Nation’s Capital
every year. In late years also the value of the arts and industries
department of the Museum is becoming more and more appreciated
by the public and by industrial organizations, and the exhibits por-
traying the scope of entire industries are being augmented at an
increasing rate by the cooperation of trade associations who assemble
these comprehensive exhibits from a number of manufacturers. The
auditorium of the National Museum is used every year by a large
number of local and national scientific and other societies for the
dissemination of useful knowledge through conferences and lectures,
and the scientific staffs of the Museum, the Bureau of American
Ethnology, and other branches of the Institution contribute their
share in the program of the diffusion of knowledge through scientific
and semipopular lectures, both officially and unofficially. The archeo-
logical excavations conducted in Florida during the past winter by
the Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology were known
throughout Florida as the “ Smithsonian excavations” and attracted
thousands of visitors, to whom Doctor Fewkes lectured several times
each week on the prehistoric Indian inhabitants of the region. The
latest addition to the Institution’s program in the diffusion of know]l-
edge was the inauguration during the year of a series of radio talks
on scientific subjects presented in popular form, and the response to
these was so widespread that the series will be continued with in-
creased scope during the coming year. This program of dissemina-
tion of knowledge in scientific matters is carried on, as stated at the
beginning, with the greatest difficulty because of the very limited
endowment of the Institution, and were more means at its disposal,
the Institution would be enabled to greatly expand its work along
these lines, as well as in its other fundamental purpose, the increase
of knowledge through scientific research and exploration.

Perhaps the most important development of the year in the In-
stitution’s affairs is the promising outlook for a building to house
the growing National Gallery of Art. As noted in last year’s re-
port, Congress has provided a site in the Smithsonian Park for such
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

a building and funds were obtained privately for the preparation
of plans. Mr. Charles A. Platt was selected as the architect and at
the close of the year the plans were well under way. In addition
to this, Senator Lodge during the year offered an amendment to
the deficiency appropriations bill which would have provided funds
for beginning the erection of a building, but the amendment was
not accepted. However, these developments indicate an awakening
to the realization that America should no longer be practically the
only civilized nation on earth without a National Art Gallery, and
it is hoped that in the near future funds will be provided for a
suitable home for the valuable art collections belonging to the
Nation.

Dr. William L. Abbott has continued his contributions during the

year for researches in natural history and collection of specimens in
China.

Further generous contributions have been made by Mr. John A.
Roebling for researches in astrophysics, providing for aiding the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 5

solar observing stations in Chile and the United States, for publica-
tion of scientific papers, for purchase of instruments, and for making
meteorological investigations elsewhere.

Mr. Washington A. Roebling has made a generous donation for the
purchase of minerals.

The National Academy of Sciences has given the sum of $1,500
for researches in paleontology.

The Institution is also indebted to the Research Corporation for
$1,250 for research work.

Freer Gallery of Art—In compliance with the instructions of the
Board of Regents, a sinking fund for the investment of surplus in-
come from the Freer bequest has been created. The amount paid
into this fund during the year was $138,688.75. The invested funds
of the Freer bequest are classified as follows:

The practice of depositing on time, in local trust companies and
banks, such revenues as may be spared temporarily has been con-
tinued during the pasti year, and interest on these deposits has
amounted to $1,014.59. The income during the year for current ex-
penses, consisting of interest on permanent investments and other
miscellaneous sources, including cash balance at the beginning of the
year, amounted to $72,558.59. Revenues and principal of funds for
specific purposes, except the Freer bequest, amounted to $91,919.99.
Revenues on account of Freer bequest amounted to $234,446.50. Cash
recalled from the time deposits, $34,000; aggregating a total of
$432,925.08.

The disbursements, described more fully in the annual report of
the executive committee, were classed as follows: General objects of
the Institution, $64,960.03; for specific purposes (except the Freer
bequest), $58,501.72; temporary advances for field expenses, etc., in
excess of repayments, $4,130.12; expenditures pertaining to the
Charles L. Freer bequest, $291,768.05; and cash balance on hand
June 30, 1924, $13,565.16.

The following appropriations were intrusted by Congress to the
care of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year 1924:

RESEARCHES AND PXPLORATIONS

Every year the Institution engages, so far as its limited means
will permit, in explorations and field work, and a few of these ex-
peditions will be mentioned here briefly to indicate the nature of the
work accomplished. A number of other expeditions and researches
in various fields of science are described in the appendixes on the
National Museum, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Astro-
physical Observatory, and the Freer Gallery of Art. Ina few cases,
the entire expedition is financed and managed by the Institution,
but the small amount of income remaining each year, after the ad-
ministrative costs of carrying on the work of the Institution are met,
is soon exhausted, and thereafter it is only possible to cooperate in
various ways in expeditions financed by other scientific institutions.

GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS IN THE CANADIAN ROCKIES

During the summer and early fall of 1923, your Secretary con-
tinued his geological field work in the Canadian Rockies of Al-
berta and British Columbia. His main objective was to secure data
on the pre-Devonian strata from the Clearwater River southeast to
the Bow Valley and along the eastern side of the Columbia River
Valley.

It was found that the Mons formation which was discovered on
the headwaters of the Saskatchewan River at Glacier Lake, extended
southwesterly on the western side of the Continental Divide in Brit-
ish Columbia to the southern end of the Stanford Range between
the Kootenay River and Columbia Lake, which is at the head of
the Great Columbia River, which here flows northwesterly in what
is known as the Rocky Mountain Trench. The valley of this latter
river was found to be largely underlain by the limestones and shales
of the Mons formation of the Ozarkian system, and the strata have
been upturned, faulted, and folded prior to the great pre-Glacial

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 7

period of erosion that cut out the Rocky Mountain Trench. On the
eastern side of this valley, the Mons formation is more than 3,800
feet in thickness in the Beaverfoot-Brisco-Stanford Range, and con-
tains four well-developed fossil faunas which show it to lie between
the Upper Cambrian and the Ordovician systems of this and other
parts of the continent. Near the head of the Sinclair Canyon there
was discovered a great development of the Lower Ordovician, and
at several localities cliffs of massive Upper Cambrian limestones
were recognized beneath the Mons formation.

This whole region is ideal for geological field work, as the numer-
ous canyons and ridges expose many of the formations from base to
summit. On the whole, the season was a successful one for its geo-
logical results.

EXPEDITION TO DINOSAUR NATIONAL MONUMENT, UTAH

In May, 1923, Mr. C. W. Gilmore, curator of vertebrate paleon-
tology, National Museum, was detailed to take charge of an expedi-
tion to the Dinosaur National Monument in northeastern Utah for
the purpose of securing for exhibition in the Museum a mountable
skeleton of the large sauropodous dinosaur, Diplodocus. 'The fossil
deposit in this region was discovered in 1909 by Mr. Earl Douglass,
and has been worked continuously since that time by the Carnegie
Museum of Pittsburgh. By 1922, the Carnegie Museum had secured
sufficient material for their purposes, and the Institution was notified
of their intention to cease operations, leaving uncovered two partially
articulated specimens of Diplodocus, a mountable skeleton of which
has long been desired by the National Museum. Mr. Gilmore ar-
rived at the fossil quarry on May 15, and a preliminary survey showed
that one of the two skeletons would form the basis of a mountable
specimen while the preserved parts of the other would serve ad-
mirably to replace the missing bones of the first. Regular work in
the quarry began on May 24 and continued until August 8. “Mr.
Gilmore employed three men with experience in this field, and was
assisted after June 5 by Mr. Norman H. Boss, of the Museum’s
paleontological force. Regarding the difficulties involved, Mr. Gil-
more says: ;

The work of quarrying these often fragile bones from the ledge of rock
without doing irreparable damage is a slow and tedious operation, involving
the skill of both the stone cutter and the miner. Further difficulty is encountered
in handling by primitive methods the immense blocks of rock inclosing the
bones, with the subsequent arduous work of boxing and transportation. The
largest block quarried, containing the sacrum with attached hip bones, weighed
nearly 6,000 pounds when ready for shipment. The transportation of the boxes
to the railroad involved a haul by teams of 150 miles across country and over
a range of mountains 9,100 feet above sea level. However, 34 large boxes hav-
ing a combined weight of over 25 tons were safely transported.
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

As a result of this expedition, enough material was secured for a
good skeletal mount of Diplodocus which, it is estimated, will exceed
80 feet in length with a height at the hips of 14 feet.

BIOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS IN THE YANG-TZE VALLEY, CHINA

Through the continued generosity of Dr. W. L. Abbott, Mr. Charles
M. Hoy sailed for China toward the close of 1922 to collect verte-
brates for the Institution in the Yang-Tze Valley region. His first
collecting was done in the Yochow district, where he obtained a total
of 169 mammals and 84 birds. At the beginning of the fiscal year
just past, Hoy left for a trip through Hunan and Kiangsi, in the
course of which many interesting specimens were obtained. From
Kuling, Kiangsi, a letter was received from Hoy, describing a series
of misfortunes, as follows:

The day after writing my last letter to you, from Iningchow [never received],
I had a bad fall and badly wrenched my back. For about a week I was
searcely able to crawl about. Just when my back was getting so I could
straighten up I had another accident and shot myself through the left leg with
the Colt 45 automatic. The accident was due to a “hang fire.’ The gun did
not go off when the hammer struck and so I lowered the gun to eject the
shell when the shell exploded. The bullet struck me on the inside of the leg
4 inches above the ankle bone. * * * The wound is healing nicely, but the
doctor says that it may be several months before I get full use of my foot and
that I will most likely have a slight permanent limp. However, I am hoping
that it won’t interfere with my collecting, but even if I won’t be able to do
much walking myself I have one man who is a crack shot with the shotgun
and another that is fair with the rifle, so I ought to be able.to get specimens
anyhow. My trip down from Iningchow was rather uneventful except for the
above accidents. We were under military guard all the way from there to
Kuikiang. The country, it seems, is full of disbanded Northern soldiers who
have driven out the natives and occupied their farms. Consequently it is
dangerous for even natives to travel through that region. The final explana-
tion given me, as to the reason of the escort, was that it was feared that my
guns and ammunition might fall into their hands. We were fired on once, in
the night, but aside from a lot of shouting and that one shot, nothing hap-
pened. We could never learn who fired the shot, but the way things turned out
I am convinced that we were mistaken for bandits and the shot was fired to
scare us off. Owing to the accidents, I have not been able to secure any speci-
mens since the writing of my last letter. My outfit has not yet arrived owing
to the heavy rains, but as soon as it gets here I plan to send my men out collect-
ing so I will be able to get specimens notwithstanding the fact that I am con-
fined to the house.

The gunshot wound was apparently healing, but while Hoy was
still confined to the house he developed a severe case of appendicitis,
necessitating an immediate operation, from which he never recovered.

BOTANICAL EXPLORATION IN PANAMA AND CENTRAL AMERICA

Dr. William R. Maxon, associate curator of plants in the National
Museum, was detailed in May, 1923, to accompany an expedition

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9

from the Department of Agriculture to Panama and Central
America. Unfortunately rains interfered seriously with field work
in both Panama and Nicaragua, but in spite of this handicap, a gen-
eral botanical collection of about 4,500 specimens was made, about
equally divided among Panama, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica. In
his report on the expedition, Doctor Maxon says:

Aside from two days given to collecting in the interesting Juan Diaz region,
east of Panama City, work in Panama was mostly confined to the Canal Zone,
being conducted chiefly from headquarters on the Pacific side, at Balboa, with
the courteous assistance of the Panama Canal authorities. Of particular in-
terest were trips to Barro Colorado, a large wooded island in Gatun Lake
opposite Frijoles, recently set aside as a wild reserve upon representation of
the Institute for Research in Tropical America; the virgin forest region at the
headwaters of the Rio Chinilla, above Monte Lirio; and the Fort Sherman
Military Reservation, which includes the famous old Spanish stronghold, Fort
San Lorenzo, at the mouth of the Chagres. All these localities are forested
and are rich in palms, and special attention was directed to obtaining material
in this difficult group. With the steady clearing of leased land for planting
bananas the original forest in the Canal Zone is rapidly disappearing, and with
it its characteristic palm associations. * * *

About three weeks were spent in Nicaragua, wholly in the region west of Lake
- Nicaragua and mainly working from Managua, the capital, which lies pic-
turesquely at a new elevation 90 miles inland from the Pacific coast, flanked
by numerous voleanoes. Except for the volcanoes and the low range called the
Sierra, given over to coffee production, western Nicaragua is low and almost
entirely cleared of forest. Cane and grazing are the main industries. The
soil is largely a rich black loam of volcanic origin, and supports a luxuriant
growth of tall grasses, the arborescent vegetation being mainly confined to
roadsides and abandoned “ potrero.” The most interesting trips were to the
region of Casa Colorado in the Sierra, and to Mombacho and Santiago vol-
canoes. The material collected indicates a rich flora for the higher mountain
slopes, one that would amply repay extended exploration.

From Corinto Doctor Maxon proceeded by steamer to Puntarenas, the Pa-
cific port of Costa Rica. The ascent by rail from this port in the semiarid
coastal plain to the capital, San José, lying at .an altitude of 1,140 meters in
the cool meseta central, is through a region remarkably diverse as to physiog-
raphy. From San José three principal trips were made: First, to La Palma,
a classical botanical locality on the cloud-drenched southwestern slopes of
IrazG voleano; next to Santa Clara in the mountains a few leagues south of
Cartago; then to Vara Blanca lying high up in an almost unexplored region
between the voleanoes Pofis and Barba. Special attention was here given to
ferns and orchids, both groups being extremely abundant both as to species
and individuals, and many new and interesting species in these and other
groups were collected.

STUDIES ON EARLY MAN IN EUROPE

During the summer and early fall of 1923, Dr. AleS Hrdlicka,
curator of physical anthropology, National Museum, revisited the
important sites of early man in western and central Europe, as well
as the institutions in which are preserved the skeletal remains of
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

ancient man and the fossil European apes. During the trip Doctor
Hrdlitka acted as director of the American School in France for
Prehistoric Studies, and was accompanied by a number of American
graduate students. One of the principal objects of the trip was to
secure accurate measurements of the teeth, particularly the lower
molars, of the larger fossil apes and early man by one observer, by
a strictly defined method, and with accurate instruments. Another
object was to take photographs of the various sites of early man of
which good photographs were not available.

The trip included visits to various regions in England, Holland,
Belgium, France, Germany, Bohemia, Austria, and Croatia. In
these countries practically all of the important sites were visited
and as far as possible the skeletal remains of early man and the
fossil apes in museums along the route were examined and measured.
In many cases assistance was given by prominent anthropologists
connected with these institutions in giving first-hand reviews of the
knowledge concerning the specimens and sites, and sometimes in per-
sonal: conduct to the sites themselves. In Holland Doctor Hrdliéka
had the unique privilege of visiting Prof. Eugene Dubois, of Haar-
lem, and seeing the famous remains of the Pithecanthropus as well
as the other Java remains in his possession. Regarding the Pithe-
canthropus remains, Doctor Hrdlicka says:

The remains of, or those attributed to, the Pithecanthropus consist of the
now thoroughly cleansed skull-cap, a femur and three teeth, two molars and
one premolar. Besides these there is from another locality a piece of a strange
primitive lower jaw, and also two skulls with many parts of the skeletons of
a later, though yet rather primitive, type of man from consolidated calcareous
deposits in still another part of the island.

The examination of the originals belonging to the Pithecanthropus find was
in many respects a revelation. It was seen that none of the casts now in
various institutions are accurate, and that the same is true of the so far
published illustrations, above all those of the teeth and femur. The originals
are even more important than held hitherto. The new brain cast shows an
organ very close to human. The femur is without question human. When the
detailed study of all these specimens is published, which Doctor Dubois expects
to occur before the end of the winter, the specimens, though all controversial
points may not be settled, will assume even a weightier place in science than
they have had up to the present.

The trip resulted in an overwhelming sense of the greatness and scientific
importance of the field of early man in western and central Europe and in a

keen appreciation of the opportunities for cooperation in this field by American
students.

SMITHSONIAN SERIES OF RADIO TALKS
Beginning on October 19, 1923, arrangements were made with

radio station WRC, of the Radio Corporation of America, to broad-
cast a series of talks on the Institution and its branches. These

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 1l

were continued until November 16, with such success that in the
spring the conclusion was reached that there would be mutual ad-
vantage to the Institution and to station WRC in giving a series
of talks on scientific subjects. Accordingly there was established a
regular Smithsonian period every Wednesday at 6.15 p. m., and the
series was opened on April 9 by a talk on “ The giants of the animal
world,” by Mr. Austin H. Clark. This was followed by 10 others,
the last one being given on June 18, when the program was discon-
tinued for the summer months.

This new means of carrying out the Institution’s function of the
diffusion of knowledge appears to be highly effective, as indicated
by the number of responses to the talks received at the Institution
and at the broadcasting station. The direction of the entire pro-
gram was placed under Mr. Austin H. Clark, of the National Mu-
seum, who secured the cooperation not only of the members of the
staff of the Institution and its branches but also of the Carnegie
Institution of Washington and of the various scientific bureaus of
the Government whose work is complementary to that of the Insti-
tution. Altogether there were given during the year 18 talks in the
Smithsonian series, as follows:

The Smithsonian Institution, by Austin H. Clark.

The Work of the Smithsonian Observatory, by C. G. Abbot.

The Bureau of Ethnology: What It Is and What It Does, by J. Walter
Fewkes.

Department of Arts and Industries of the United States National Museum,
by Carl W. Mitman.

The Historical Collections of the Smithsonian Institution, United States
National Museum, by Theodore T. Belote.

The National Gallery of Art, by W. H. Holmes.

The National Herbarium, by F. V. Coville.

The Giants of the Animal World, by Austin H. Clark.

Little Folks in Greenland, by Elisabeth Deichmann.

The National Zoological Park, under the direction of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, by N. Hollister.

Useful Plants from America, by F. L. Lewton.

Shooting Stars and What They Are, by George P. Merrill.

Animal Terrors of Past Ages—Dinosaurs, by Charles W. Gilmore.

Surveying the Ocean with the Non-Magnetic Yacht Carnegie, by J. P. Ault,
of the Carnegie Institution.

Program of native Indian music arranged by Miss Frances Densmore.

Large Game Animals of North America, by E. W. Nelson, Chief of the Bureau
_ of Biological Survey.
Flying Animals, by Austin H. Clark.
Atmospheric Electricity, by D. J. Mauchly, of the Carnegie Institution.

The interest shown in these informative radio talks on scientific
matters and the vast audience which it is possible to reach through
the microphone make it apparent that this is destined to become a
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

most important phase of the Institution’s work in diffusing knowl-
edge, and it is intended to renew the series with increased scope in
the fall.

ASSISTANCE TO JAPANESE LIBRARIES DESTROYED DURING THE
RECENT EARTHQUAKE

The recent disastrous earthquake in Japan destroyed large collec-
tions of books in many of the Japanese libraries, including the entire
collection of 700,000 volumes in the library of the Imperial Univer-
sity of Tokyo. During the year an appeal was received in this
country from the Japanese Association of the League of Nations for
books to replenish these unfortunate libraries, especially those of
universities and colleges. The Institution made up as nearly as pos-
sible complete sets of its own publications and forwarded them to a
number of the Japanese libraries, the volumes and pamphlets thus
sent totaling several hundred. In addition, the International Ex-
change Service of the Institution served as a central forwarding
agency for the other American institutions desiring to contribute
their publications, and during the year several large consignments
containing many thousands of publications were transmitted to
Japan.

COOPERATION WITH ORGANIZATIONS MEETING IN WASHINGTON

There has been during the year an unusually large number of
meetings in Washington of scientific or other organizations whose
work has been in some way related to that of the Smithsonian. In
providing an auditorium in the Museum for these meetings, and
through the assistance given in various ways by the scientific and
administrative staff, the Institution has been able to render a real
service in promoting scientific work and discussion. To illustrate
the appreciation of this service by organizations taking advantage
of these facilities, there may be mentioned three important meetings
held during the year. The American Association of Museums held
its nineteenth annual meeting in Washington “May 10-13, most of
the sessions being held at the National Museum. After the meeting
the secretary of the association wrote to the Institution in part as
follows:

The success of the nineteenth annual meeting of the American Association
of Museums was due in considerable part to the hospitality of the Smithsonian
Institution and the friendly help of many individuals on its staff.

At the close of the first National Conference on Outdoor Recrea-
tion, held in Washington in June, the following resolutions were
passed :

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY £3

Whereas the success of this first National Conference on Outdoor Recreation
is due in large measure to the very fine services and facilities made available
by the officers of the Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum, who
have been untiring in their efforts to promote the comfort and convenience
of the delegates to the conference: Therefore be it

Resolved, That the conference hereby expresses its sincere appreciation of
the spirit of cordial hospitality displayed by the officers and employees of these
great scientific and educational agencies and requests its executive chairman to
so advise Dr. Charles D. Walcott, Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
and his official associates.

The annual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences, which
has for many years been held in the National Museum, was held this
year for the first time in the academy’s new building. The follow-
ing resolution passed during the sessions expresses appreciation of
the services which the Institution has been able to render to the
academy in the past:

Resolved, That on the occasion of the removal of its offices from the Smith-
sonian Institution to its new building, the National Academy of Sciences
gratefully expresses its obligations to the Secretary and the Board of Regents
of the Smithsonian Institution for the courtesies extended for over half a
century through the housing and care of the academy records and library,
through its cooperation in the conduct of academy business, and through its
effective aid in promoting the objects of the academy ;

And that the academy expressly acknowledges its high esteem and thanks
to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Charles Doolittle Walcott,
for his personal interest in the welfare of the academy, his unfailing interest
in and attention to the work of the academy in the advancement of science,
and his distinguished services as treasurer, vice president, acting president,
president, and member of the council and committees, both official and un-
official, in its behalf.

PUBLICATIONS

There were issued during the year by the Institution and its
branches a total of 70 volumes and pamphlets, of which 142,385
copies were distributed, including 407 volumes and separates of the
Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, 25,987 volumes and sepa-
rates of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, 19,085 volumes
and separates of the Smithsonian Annual Reports, 3,748 Smithsonian
special publications, 78,734 volumes and separates of the various
series of the National Museum publications, 13,974 publications of
the Bureau of American Ethnology, 78 publications of the National
Gallery of Art, 65 volumes of the Annals of the Astrophysical Ob-
servatory, 35 reports on the Harriman Alaska Expedition, and
1,275 reports of the American Historical Association.

The publications of the Institution, now issued in 11 distinct
series, are its principal means of carrying out a part of its stated
purpose, “the diffusion of knowledge.” There is a widespread and
growing demand for its publications, not only from specialists for
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

the more technical series, but also from the general public, among
whom the importance of scientific matters is coming to be more
and more realized. This popular demand is chiefly for the Smith-
sonian Annual Reports, which contain a general appendix consisting
of series of specially selected articles presenting in readable form
progress and interesting developments in all branches of science.
Unfortunately, owing to the rush of work at the Government Print-
ing Office both during the war and since, these volumes have fallen
behind date, until now they are issued over two years late. How-
ever, for the coming fiscal year, Congress has allotted an additional
amount to enable the Institution to catch up with these reports by
issuing two in one year, and it is hoped that within a year or two
they will again appear more nearly on time. ;

The various publications of the National Museum and of the
Bureau of American Ethnology are given in detail in the report on
publications appended hereto.

In the series of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections 13 papers
were issued during the year, among which may be mentioned two
papers by your secretary on the results of his geological field work
in the Canadian Rockies; an illustrated pamphlet on the History of
Electric Light, by Henry Schroeder, of the General Electric Co.;
a paper on the Telescoping of the Cetacean Skull, by Gerrit S.
Miller, jr., of the National Museum; and a second paper by Dr.
J. Walter Fewkes describing and figuring the beautiful designs on
prehistoric Indian pottery from the Mimbres Valley, N. Mex.

Allotments for printing—The congressional allotments for the
printing of the Smithsonian reports and the various publications of
the branches of the Institution were practically used up at the close
of the year. The appropriation for the Institution and its branches

for the coming year ending June 30, 1925, totals $90,000, allotted as
follows:

Committee on printing and publication—The Smithsonian ad-
visory committee on printing and publication considers all manu-
scripts offered for publication by the Institution and its branches
and makes recommendations thereon to your secretary. It also
considers matters of publication policy and means of effecting econ-

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

omies in the Institution’s printing and binding. During the year
nine meetings were held and 100 manuscripts acted upon. The
membership of the committee is as follows: Dr. Leonhard Stejneger,
head curator of biology, National Museum, chairman; Dr. George P.
Merrill, head curator of geology, National Museum; Dr. J. Walter
Fewkes, chief, Bureau of American Ethnology; Mr. N. Hollister,
superintendent, National Zoological Park; and Mr. W. P. True,
editor of the Smithsonian Institution, secretary. Toward the close
of the year there were added to the membership of the committee
Dr. Marcus Benjamin, editor of the National Museum, and Mr.
Stanley Searles, editor of the Bureau of American Ethnology.

LIBRARY

The service of the libraries administered under the Smithsonian
Institution has been continued, although with increasing difficulty
owing to the need for more assistants. Mr. Paul Brockett resigned
as assistant librarian, after 37 years with the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, in order to assume charge of the new building of the National
Academy of Sciences as assistant secretary and librarian.

The additions to the libraries reached a total of 12,249, as com-
pared with 10,938 the past year. The number of loans was 13,326,
as compared with 12,076 the past year, exclusive of books lent from
the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress. Efforts to
secure missing parts for including in incomplete sets resulted in the
receipt of 1,786. Owing to the lack of sufficient clerical help, it
has not been possible to have typed for the general library catalogue
the catalogue cards of special collections that have been prepared
during the year. Consequently the number of volumes catalogued
for the general catalogue dropped from 6,341 to 5,348.

Probably the most important addition of the year was the Edgar
E. Teller collection presented by Mrs. Teller to the library of the
United States National Museum. The catalogue of the European
Historical Series of the Watts de Peyster collection is approaching
completion.

NATIONAL MUSEUM

Since 1916 the collections in the care of the Museum have been
increased by two and one-fourth million specimens, and its exhibi-
tion space has been enlarged by the addition of the Aircraft Build-
ing. Unfortunately, however, the appropriations have not kept pace
with this rapid development, and it is now only with the greatest
care and economy that the actual work of the safe-keeping of the
collections and their classification and exhibition is carried on.
There is practically nothing left to care for the normal expansion
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of the Museum’s work ‘and for increasing its usefulness to the people
of the country. The Museum, with its vast collections, serves the
public not as it would and could but as its limited financial resources
permit. One forward step has been made, however, in the reclassi-
fication of salaries which becomes effective on July 1, 1924, and as
a whole the scientific force of the Museum is at last to receive ade-
quate compensation.

The outstanding feature of the year was the gift to the Nation
for exhibition in the National Museum of a complete American
colonial room, presented by Mrs. Gertrude D. Ritter, of Washington,
D. C. This notable gift includes wall paneling from the old Bliss
homestead at Springfield, Mass., and a remarkable collection of fur-
niture, china, glassware, pewter, pictures, and textiles belonging to
the same period of early American history. The room is set up and
arranged in one of the Museum rooms exactly as it would have
appeared in a colonial home of the period of about 1750.

A program of intensive work on the development of the Loeb col-
lection of chemical types was made possible this year through the
accrued interest on the Loeb fund. A curator of the collection was
appointed and the advisory committee reorganized, and it is ex-
pected that in a year or two the value of such a type series of chem-
icals will be amply shown.

The Museum received during the year 362,942 specimens, a notable
increase over last year in numbers and also in scientific value.
Over 8,000 duplicate specimens classified and labeled were dis-
tributed for educational purposes to schools and colleges. A some-
what detailed account of the accessions in the various departments of
the Museum is given in the report of the administrative assistant in
charge, and only a few of the more notable acquisitions will be men-
tioned here. In anthropology a noteworthy collection of ethnological
material from the Philippines, made by the late Capt. E. Y. Miller,
was presented by Mrs. Florence G. Miller, and a number of speci-
mens representing several Indian tribes of South America was the
gift of Dr. D. S. Bullock. A valuable series of unique ancient
earthenware bowls from the Mimbres Valley, N. Mex., was presented
by the Bureau of American Ethnology. <A series of prehistoric
antiquities from ancient sites in France, Belgium, and Germany was
added by Dr. AleS Hrdlitka as the result of his recent trip to
Europe.

The collections received in biology greatly surpass those of recent
years both numerically and in scientific importance, the latter point
being emphasized by the addition of a large number of species and

genera new to the Museum, many gaps in the collections having been
filled. The outstanding accession of the year is the gift by Dr.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 1

J. M. Aldrich, associate curator of insects, of his collection of 45,000
specimens of dipterous flies, the result of his life’s collecting and
study. Considerable collections were received from Rev. D. C.
Graham, made during his explorations in the Province of Szechwan,
China. Dr. W. L. Abbott secured a large number of plants, reptiles,
and amphibians during an expedition to Santo Domingo. The
National Herbarium was greatly enriched by three expeditions to
tropical America, that of Dr. A. 8. Hitchcock to Panama, Ecuador,
Peru, and Bolivia; of Paul C. Standley to the Canal Zone and Costa
Rica; and of Dr. William R. Maxon to Panama, Costa Rica, and Nica-
ragua. The research work of the staff of the department of biology
has been continued whenever time could be spared from the neces-
sary work of caring for the increasing collections, but the divisions
are greatly undermanned and much more scientific work would be
accomplished if more assistants were available.

The department of geology received a large amount of material
of unusual value for both exhibition and study purposes, the most
noteworthy accessions being the large sauropodous dinosaur from
the Dinosaur National Monument, Utah, and the Edgar E. Teller
and George M. Austin collections of fossils, which together comprise
at least 125,000 specimens. The economic collections have been in-
creased by the addition of a number of ores and by a series of
diamond-bearing rocks from Arkansas. Meteoric irons from New
Mexico, Kansas, Chile, Spain, and Australia added new material to
the meteorite collection. The mineral collections received a number
of specimens chiefly through the generosity of Col. Washington A.
Roebling, and several cut gems were added to the Isaac Lea collec-
tion. Expansion of the study series and research work occupied
much of the time of the curators and their assistants.

The divisions of mineral and mechanical technology received many
interesting additions, including two automobiles presented by the
Cadillac Motor Co., one made in 1903 and the other in 1923, the
latter being cut away in cross section to show the working parts.
Another valuable accession was a complete working unit of a
Strowger automatic telephone system equipped with three telephones
which can be operated by the visitor, thus enabling him to observe
the functioning of the apparatus. The division of textiles, includ-
ing also wood technology, organic chemistry, foods, and medicine,
received over 3,300 specimens during the year, including large
series of industrial specimens illustrating every branch of rubber
manufacture, the manufacture of leather and shoes, and the prepara-
tion and dyeing of seal, muskrat, and rabbit skins. There were also
accessioned many chemical materials used in various industries, a
number of interesting textiles, and material of value to be added
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

to the exhibitions in the division of medicine. The division of
graphic arts received numerous additions pertaining to the history
and development of the printing art and held a number of suc-
cessful exhibitions of prints, etchings, lithographs, and photographs.
In the division of history the most notable addition was the Ameri-
can colonial room presented by Mrs. Gertrude D. Ritter, mentioned
previously in thissummary. The division also received a gown worn
by Mrs. Warren G. Harding and another worn by Mrs. Benjamin
Harrison to be added to the collection. of costumes of ladies of the
White House in which so much popular interest is shown.

The Museum participated in a number of field expeditions which

have resulted in greatly increasing the collections in the various .

departments. These are described in the report on the Museum ap-
pended hereto. The auditorium was used by a large number of
scientific and other societies and organizations for lectures and
meetings. Visitors to the Natural History Building during the
year totaled 540,776; to the Arts and Industries Building, 290,012;
to the Aircraft Building, 43,534; and to the Museum exhibits in the
Smithsonian Building, 104,601. Eight volumes and 44 separates
were published by the Museum during the year, and of these 78,734
copies were distributed.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

The year has witnessed substantial advance in the work of the
gallery, and a number of important art works were received notwith-
standing the fact that there is no longer suitable space available
for the display of additional exhibits. Constant effort has been
made during the year to impress upon the country the urgent need
of a National Gallery Building, and gratifying assurance of the
awakening of public interest in national art is given by the intro-
duction in the Senate by Senator Lodge of an amendment to the
deficiency appropriations bill to provide for commencing the erec-
tion of a suitable building for the gallery. Although this amend-
ment did not pass at the last session of Congress, it is hoped that
favorable action will soon be taken. It will be recalled from last
year’s report that Congress has provided a site in the Smithsonian
grounds for such a building and that funds were raised privately
for the preparation of plans. At the close of the year Mr. Charles
A. Platt, the architect selected, had the plans well under way.

The annual meeting of the National Gallery Commission was held
on December 11 and a number of important topics were considered,
including the problem of securing a National Gallery Building, a
recommendation that a division of historical architecture be included
in the National Gallery of Art, and the selection of an architect for

a at
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 19

the proposed building. Mr. Gari Melchers was selected to succeed
Mr. Daniel C. French, who had resigned as chairman of the
commission.

Permanent accessions to the gallery for the year were limited to
about 10 paintings, but Mrs. Ralph Cross Johnson deposited a
collection of 11 early Christian paintings by Italian, Dutch, Flem-
ish, and Spanish masters, and has indicated her intention of making
the “deposit ” a permanent addition to the gallery. A number of
loans were accepted during the year, and the gallery in turn loaned
a number of paintings to accredited art institutions. Three special
exhibitions were held in the gallery during the year, and the World
War portrait collection was installed in an improvised gallery on
the second floor of the Natural History Building of the National
Museum, which proved to be quite satisfactory for their exhibition.

FREER GALLERY OF ART

Work completed during the year includes the examination, classi-
fication, and cataloguing of Chinese and Japanese stone sculptures
and paintings, and much additional work has been accomplished in
the preservation, framing, lettering, and mounting of paintings,
etchings, and lithographs. Identification photographs have been
made of many objects in the collection to provide ready reference
and to save handling of the collections. A special exhibition of
Whistler etchings, dry points, and lithographs was held in four of
the galleries during January and February. Fourteen hundred gal-
lery books describing the objects on exhibition have been prepared,
and there have also been issued a Synopsis of History for the use of
students and a third printing of the pamphlet giving general infor-
mation about the gallery and collections.

Additions to the collections by purchase included Chinese bronzes,
Indian paintings, Persian paintings, and Chinese sculptures, and the
library was increased by the addition of a number of books and
pamphlets in various Asiatic and European languages. Several
cases, picture frames, and other necessary articles of equipment were
constructed in the gallery workshop.

The total attendance for the year was 111,942, including 482 visi-
tors who came to work in the study rooms or to examine objects not
on exhibition. The auditorium of the gallery was used in February
by the Library of Congress for the presentation of three recitals of
chamber music, and in April, Prof. Paul Pelliot, of the Collége de
France, gave an illustrated lecture on “Chinese bronzes, jades, and
sculptures.”

The archeological expedition to China under the joint auspices of
the gallery and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, has carried on
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

fruitful investigations in various localities in China, latterly at
Yii-ho Chén, in Honan, where some burials of the Han dynasty have
been thoroughly investigated with gratifying results. Even more
important is the cooperative agreement with regard to archeological
investigation established between the gallery and the Chinese au-
thorities. which was confirmed by the unsolicited appointment of
Mr. Bishop as Honorary Adviser in Archeology to the Historical De-
partment of the Chinese Government. This is the first definite effort
of the kind to bring Chinese archeologists and officials together in a
beneficial relationship with western archeologists and museums,
which it is hoped will provide a basis for more enlightened scholar-
ship and gradually supplant the ruthless and unscientific collecting
of Chinese antiquities on a commercial scale as hitherto allowed.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

The aim of the Bureau of American Ethnology is to discover and
disseminate correct ideas of the Indian as a race, that our people
may better understand and appreciate his history, language, soci-
ology, music, religion, and various arts and industries. The sources
of this information are from year to year becoming fewer and fewer
as the customs indigenous to America are lost in the settlement of
the former homes of the Indians by the white race. It is therefore
imperative that intensive work be carried on by the staff of the
bureau to record accurately as much as possible of this material from
the Indians themselves before it is too late.

The greatly increased number of visitors to the national parks and
Indian reservations of the Western States, due to the present popu-
larity of automobile touring, has led to a desire on the part of the
general public for more information on the history and customs of
the Indians, and urgent calls from universities and other institutions
for advice and assistance in local problems relating to the Indians
have been more numerous than ever before. The bureau’s most effec-
tive means of supplying this information and answering these calls
is its unique series of publications on every phase of Indian 'ife and
culture. With the greatly increased cost of printing and the very
limited funds for the purpose placed at the disposal of the bureau,
there has resulted a very unfortunate congestion of manuscripts
awaiting publication. It is usually two or three years after a report
is handed in by a member of the staff before it can even be sent to
the printer, which not only results in difficulty in supplying the
requests of the public but is very discouraging to the scientific staff
who are carrying on this work.

A large proportion of the time of the chief of the bureau is de-
voted to administrative work, but opportunity was found to carry on

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 21

an archeological expedition to southwestern Florida, where but little
work of this character has previously been done. With the aid of
Mr. E. M. Elliott and his associates, of St. Petersburg, Doctor Fewkes
began the excavation of certain large shell mounds on Weeden Island
near St. Petersburg. One of the largest mounds proved to be a ceme-
tery, and from November until March about one-half of it was ex-
eavated. A large collection of aboriginal objects and skeletons was
made, which gives evidence of two distinct cultures, one above the
other. The lower contained crude pottery and a few implements
mostly of shell bearing considerable likeness to the so-called Archaic
Antillean culture of Cuba. The upper layer gave very fine specimens
of decorated pottery and other objects which show close relationship
to the Indian culture of Georgia, indicating a southward extension of
population possibly allied to the Muskhogean into the Florida Pen-
insula. This field work of the bureau in Florida inaugurates a plan
of cooperation of members of the staff and others to determine the
boundaries and extension of the great Muskhogean culture of the
Gulf States, the object being to obtain information on the relation-
ship of the mounds of our southern States to those of the Huastecs
on the Gulf coast of Mexico.

Dr. John R. Swanton completed the translation of stories from his
Koasati, Alabama, Hitchiti, and Creek texts; edited a manuscript on
Indian trails by the late W. E. Myer; and began the preparation of a
card index of all words in the Timucua language in the religious
works of the Franciscan missionaries Pareja and Movilla, nearly all
that is left to us of this old Florida tongue. Dr. Truman Michelson
carried on ethnological studies among the Indians of Labrador.
From his work it appears that the language of the Nascopi and Davis
Inlet Indians is the same, and merely a Montagnais dialect rather
than a distinct language. It may be noted that the folklore of the
Indians of Labrador contains more elements occurring among Cen-
tral Algonquians than has been suspected. At the close of this work,
he continued his researches of former years among the Fox Indians
at Tama, Iowa, devoting especial attention to the ceremonial runners
of these Indians.

Mr. J. P. Harrington took charge of the exploration of the Burton
Mound at Santa Barbara, Calif., under a joint arrangement with the
Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation. Many facts of
interest for the prehistory of the Santa Barbara Indians and the early
culture of the Pacific coast in general were recorded, and a great
number of skeletons, utensils, weapons, and trinkets were secured.
Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was engaged during the greater part of the year
in working up the material gathered in former years relating to the
League or Confederation of the Five Iroquois Tribes or Nations. In

20397—25——3
22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

June he visited the Six Nations of Iroquois near Brantford, Ontario,
Canada, and the Onondaga, Tonowanda, and Tuscarora in New
York State for the purpose of securing certain data regarding the
Condolence and Installation Council.

Mr. Francis La Flesche devoted his time to the assembly of his
notes on the child-naming rites and ceremonies of the Osage Indians.
Mr. La Flesche has succeeded in securing two of the remaining ver-
sions of these rites which are now practically obsolete, and these will
form the two parts of a publication on the subject, now nearing com-
pletion. Mr. W. E. Myer on his return from field work in Tennessee
began preparation of a report on the remains of the great prehistoric
Indian settlement known as Great Mound Group in Cheatham
County, Tenn. The great central mound of this ancient town was
protected by earthen breastworks surmounted at intervals by circu-
lar wooden towers, and completed by earthen bastions projecting 150
yards beyond the main walls. In addition to this fortified mound,
there were four other eminences with tops leveled into plazas, which
showed evidences of earth lodges and former buildings.

Miss Frances Densmore recorded songs of the Makah Indians at
Neah Bay, Wash., in order to compare the music of Indians living
beside the ocean with that of tribes living on the mountains, plains,
and desert. It was found, as a general observation, that the music
of the Makah resembles that of the Ute, Papago, and Yuma more
than that of the Chippewa, Sioux, and Pawnee. The Makah songs
recorded included songs of the whale legends and whaling expedi-
tions, songs of the potlatch and various social dances, songs con-
nected with contests of physical strength, “gratitude songs,” lul-
labies, courting songs, and songs of wedding festivities.

The publications of the bureau issued during the year consisted of
three bulletins, and a number of other bulletins and reports were
in press at the close of the year. There were distributed during the
year 13,974 copies of the publications of the bureau.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES

The total number of packages handled by the exchange service
during the year was 460,658, weighing 567,107 pounds, an increase
over last year of 82,832 packages and 74,291 pounds in weight. This
increase was due for the most part to the large number of publica-
tions received in this country for transmission to universities and
colleges in Japan that lost their libraries during the recent earth-
quake.

The Institution was notified during the year that the Government
of Hungary had established the Hungarian Libraries Board at
Budapest to act as the Hungarian exchange agency, and that the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 93

Governments of the Dominican Republic, Latvia, and the Free City
of Danzig had adhered to the two exchange conventions concluded
at Brussels, March 15, 1886.

The number of full and partial sets of United States official docu-
ments sent through the exchange service to depositories abroad is
now 97, there having been added during the year to receive full sets
the Ministry of Finance, Government of Northern Ireland, Belfast;
State Library, Reval, Esthonia; and the Library of the League of
Nations, Geneva, Switzerland. In addition, there is an immediate
exchange of the official journal between the United States and 41
foreign governments. During the year, this immediate exchange of
the official journal has been entered into with Haiti, Latvia, and
Norway.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

The year has veen one of the most successful in the history of the
park, both as to care and maintenance of the animal collections,
buildings, and grounds, and in service to the public. All previous
attendance records were broken by the total of 2,442,880 visitors re-
corded for the year. Among the 221 animals presented to the park
during the year were many rare and unusual species, including a fine
young Baird’s tapir presented by Mr. M. G. Henery, of Honduras.
This species of tapir has always been one of the rarest animals in
zoological collections. Through the continued interest in the park
of Mr. Victor J. Evans, of Washington, D. C., 55 animals were added
to the collections including several very rare and valuable species.
A most interesting collection from Brazil was brought to the park
by Dr. W. L. Schurz, commercial attaché, United States Embassy,
Rio de Janeiro, which included a fine South American bush dog, the
first of its kind to be shown in the park.

There were 1,645 animals in the collection on June 30, 1924,
including 458 mammals of 177 species, 1,059 birds of 276 species, and
128 reptiles of 41 species. The number of animals added during the
year was 491, while 614 were lost through exchange, death, and
return of ‘animals on deposit. Forty-two mammals were born and
27 birds hatched in the park during the year, while the death rate
was held at a normally low mark.

The 11 new yards for hoofed animals mentioned last year were
completed during the year and occupied by animals in the fall. The
superior arrangement of these paddocks for the care and exhibition
of the animals has been favorably commented on by officials of other
zoological gardens and by visitors. A new restaurant building,
needed for many years, was completed during the year, which adds
greatly to the appearance of the park and is much appreciated by
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

visitors. The most urgent present needs of the Park are a new
exhibition building for birds, the present one being in very bad
condition and much too small for the large crowds which visit it,
and a fund for the purchase of rare and unusual animals. This
fund might be increased by gift or bequest and by depositing in it
certain miscellaneous revenues of the park which ‘are now turned
into the general fund of the Treasury, if this were authorized by an
act of Congress.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

During the year arrangements were made, through the generosity
of Mr. John A. Roebling, to have sent to the Institution daily tele-
graphic reports of the solar constant value from the two solar radia-
tion stations at Montezuma, Chile, and Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz.
Experimental temperature forecasts for New York City, based on
these daily reports of solar changes, have been regularly submitted
by Mr. H. H. Clayton for certain periods of time, namely, for 3, 4,
5, and 27 days in advance and also general forecasts as to the ex-
pected departure from mean normal temperatures for the coming
months and weeks. These forecasts show undoubted prevision of
the temperature even up to 5 days after the solar observations.
The 27-day detailed forecasts have hitherto shown no correlation
with New York City temperature, but the broader forecasts for
coming weeks and months have been fairly verified. The results
are promising enough to warrant further trial, and through Mr.
Roebling’s generous support these experimental forecasts will be
continued until June 30, 1925.

Three projects were undertaken at the Mount Wilson station,
which the director occupied from July to October, 1923: First, to
begin observations on the variations of atmospheric ozone ; second, to
test new improvements on the solar cooker; and, third, to measure
the spectra of the brighter stars, using the 100-inch telescope and
special apparatus prepared for the work. In the first project ap-
paratus was made ready, but circumstances prevented the actual
beginning of the determinations of atmospheric ozone; in the sec-
ond, experiments with the solar cooker resulted in some advance-
ment and pointed the way to further progress; and in the third
highly interesting results on stellar spectrum distribution and on
star diameters were obtained.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITER-
ATURE

The condition of the International Catalogue of Scientific Litera-
ture remains practically the same as it was last year. It will be

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY : 25

recalled that publication of the catalogue was suspended in 1921,
owing to the fact that such abnormal conditions in international
exchange and publishing costs had been brought about by the war
that. many of the cooperating nations were unable to pay the conse-
quent increased prices of their subscriptions. However, the need of
this classified index to the ever-increasing literature of science is
greater now than ever before, for no publication or combination of
publications has even attempted to fill its place, and it is to be
regretted that so much effort is being independently expended to
meet special requirements when it is evident that, should these
separate undertakings be either merged or at least brought into
cooperation all would be benefited and the long-felt needs of special-
ists and librarians thus be fully met.

The International Catalogue is in a position, through its officialiy
recognized bureaus, to prepare index data to all of the scientific
publications of the world, this being a feature which no new organi-
zation can even hope to duplicate. The local bureaus, being officially
recognized and in a position of close contact with both publishers and
authors of scientific papers, have unique facilities for providing the
data necessary for abstracts and special indexes, and as such data
is needed by all agencies supplying notices of scientific publications
in whatever form, it is felt that this organization should be the
foundation on which to build a cooperative service to meet the needs
of all interested in scientific activities.

JOHN L. BAER

Mr. John L. Baer, employed by the National Museum for several
years past as temporary assistant in the department of anthropology,
died in Panama on May 28, 1924. Mr. Baer was sent to represent
the Smithsonian Institution on the Marsh Darien Expedition and his
death occurred in Panama just before the return of this expedition.

Mr. J. J. Dolan, employed by the National Museum in various
capacities for 82 years, died on November 22, 1923. Mr. Dolan
entered the service of the Museum as watchman and passed through
the various grades until he reached the position of captain of the
watch in 1903. This position he held until April 15, 1923, when he
was transferred to the office of shipper, which position he held at the
time of his death.

APPENDIX 1
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the con-
dition and operation of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1924.

The maintenance of the National Museum for the year was pro-
vided for by a Government appropriation of $452,500 in the execu-
tive and independent offices act approved February 13, 1923, with an
added item of $79,896 for increase of compensation to care for the
bonus of the employees. In 1916 the appropriation to the Museum
for all purposes was $426,000. Since 1916 the Museum has increased
its exhibition space by the acquisition of the Aircraft Building; has
materially enlarged the scope of its collections in arts and indus-
tries and in history, and has received over two and one-fourth mil-
lion additional specimens, besides assuming certain definite responsi-
bilities for the guarding and upkeep of the Freer Building. As can
be readily seen, the difference in the appropriations of 1916 and 1924
hardly covers the added cost of maintaining the buildings and
guarding the collections, leaving little or nothing to provide expert
assistance needed in carrying out the fundamental requirement of
the classification of the added collections. The growth of the
Museum in all directions continues to be increasingly conditioned by
its limited finances. Economies of all kinds are resorted to in mak-
ing the appropriation provide first for the safe-keeping of the collec-
tions and then for their classification and exhibition. The Museum
with its vast collections serves the public not as it would and could
but as its limited financial resources permit.

During the year the scientific staff of the Museum was held intact
with very few exceptions, doubtless due to the approaching read-
justment under the classification act of 1923, which becomes effective
July 1, 1924. As reported last year, tentative allocations of all posi-
tions in the Government bureaus under the Smithsonian Institution
were submitted to the Personnel Classification Board by the writer
as liaison officer of the Institution. The board this year reviewed,
revised, and approved, with few exceptions, the allocations of the
Museum employees. The few positions still awaiting the board’s
final approval will, it is expected, be settled within a few days. The
results of the classification act are far-reaching. The scientific force

27
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of the Museum is at last to receive adequate compensation, as a whole.
There is, however, still one lot of scientific workers whose gradings
must be revised to put them on an equality with similar employees
elsewhere, but this will doubtless soon be satisfactorily adjusted.

The outstanding feature of this year was the addition to the
Museum exhibition halls of an American colonial room, the gift of
Mrs. Gertrude D. Ritter, as mentioned elsewhere in the report. This
is the first period room to be permanently installed in the Museum.
One of the foyer rooms in the Natural History Building has been
entirely transformed and now preserves the home atmosphere of the
early settlers of our country.

The time has come, with the continual stream of additions to the
collections, when new objects can usually be displayed only by with-
drawing from exhibition other objects, often of equal interest. The
installation of the colonial room necessitated the condensation of
the District of Columbia faunal exhibit.

The Museum was able by curtailing its archeological exhibition
to materially assist the National Gallery of Art. The pressing needs
of the gallery for additional hanging space led to the construction of
a gallery 40 feet square in the west end of the east north range,
second floor of the Natural History Building, to accommodate the
nucleus of the National Portrait Gallery. This collection consists
of the series of paintings especially made by American artists of
persons prominently associated in the Versailles peace treaty—the
group picture of the various delegates around the council table, and
22 individual portraits of the distinguished leaders of America and
the allied nations. Designed especially for this collection, the gal-
lery admirably fills its purpose. .

A program of greater development for the Loeb collection of
chemical types was made possible this year through the accrued in-
terest on the Loeb fund, and includes the employment of a chemist
to devote his entire time to its furtherance. The advisory committee
on this collection was reorganized about the middle of the year to
provide representation of the varied governmental agencies in Wash-
ington interested in chemistry. The committee is now constituted as
follows:

Dr. J. E. Zanetti, chairman of the division of chemistry and chemi-
cal technology, National Research Council, ex officio; Dr. C. A.
Browne, Chief of the Bureau of Chemistry, United States Depart-
ment of Agriculture, ex officio; Dr. S. C. Lind, chief chemist of the
Bureau of Mines, United States Department of the Interior, ex
officio; Dr. W. F. Hillebrand, Chief of the Division of Chemistry,
Bureau of Standards, United States Department of Commerce, ex
officio; James K. Senior, representative of the committee in the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 99

Middle West; Dr. C. L. Alsberg, representative of the committee on
the Pacific coast; and F. L. Lewton, representative from the United
States National Museum.

On the recommendation of the committee, O. IE. Roberts, jr., was
appointed curator of the Loeb collection of chemical types on April
1, 1924. Twenty-seven specimens were added to the collection during
the year and several hundred are being prepared for presentation.
It is expected that the intensive work of the next year or two will
demonstrate the value of a type series of this kind.

The collections of the National Museum in the field of the arts and
industries are more and more becoming recognized as a vast refer-
ence book of authentic information. Various governmental agencies
rely upon the Museum’s specimens for the identification and com-
parison of new material. Manufacturers are beginning to realize
that the deposition of their products in the collections of the Museum
acts as an additional protection against suits for infringement, and
those who may have been accidentally granted a patent on an art
that is not new. Several examples of the value of this protection
have recently been brought to the attention of the Museum by patent
examiners and attorneys for patentees. In one case a suit for in-
fringement involving large damages was settled out of court upon
the evidence of a Museum specimen. In two other. cases the denial
by the Patent Office of a patent on a product constructed upon what
were claimed to be entirely new principles was found warranted
after examinations of specimens in the National Museum. The old
adage, “There is nothing new under the sun,” is often shown to be
true when an examination is made of the Museum’s collections. That
feature of the American patent system which denies a patent to an
art or invention that has been shown to the public for two years or
more increases the importance of a great collection illustrating
industrial processes and products and makes it an important refer-
ence book to the United States Patent Office as well as to manu-
facturers, inventors, and the investing public. With the continued
cooperation of American industries these collections will grow in
importance and scope, enabling the National Museum to render
more efficient service along these lines.

The Museum served also in the diffusion of knowledge by assist-
ing the parent institution in its broadcasting program under Austin
H. Clark, of the Museum staff, in whose charge the subject was
placed by the secretary. Arrangements were made for broadcast-
ing from Station WRC, Radio Corporation of America, a talk on
the Smithsonian proper, historical in nature, and a series of sup-
plementary talks on the various major divisions. Seven 15-minute
talks were accordingly given by staff members, the first on October
19 and the last on November 16, 1923.

30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

The conclusion was reached in the spring, as a result of careful
study of radio programs, that the Institution and Station WRC
could to their mutual advantage give a series of informative talks
on special scientific topics. This led to the establishment of a regu-
lar Smithsonian period every Wednesday at 6.15 p.m. The Car-
negie Institution of Washington and the various scientific bureaus of
the Government whose work is more or less complementary to that
of the Smithsonian cooperated in making possible so ambitious a
project. The series was inaugurated on April 9 by a talk by Mr.
Clark on “ The giants of the animal world.” This was followed by
10 others, equally instructive, the last on “Atmospheric electricity,”
by Dr. S. J. Mauchly, of the Carnegie Institution, given in coopera-
tion with the Smithsonian on June 18, 1924. Altogether 18 items
were broadcast by the Smithsonian Institution during the year,
18 different individuals participating, of whom 7 appeared under
the auspices of or in cooperation with the Smithsonian and the
remaining 11 as members of the staff, 7 being from the Museum.
Those who participated in this program are few in number, how-
ever, as compared with those who contributed toward making it a
success hy furnishing information, suggestions, and encouragement.
The series will, it is expected, be resumed in the early autumn.

Lack of spacé makes it necessary at times to refuse objects ten-
dered for the collections, often where the Museum would like to
encourage the intended donor to bring to the Museum not only his
treasures but his problems also, for the Museum renders service in
many ways. By its exhibition collections it conveys a message to
those citizens from all parts of the land who visit their Capital;
by its reserve series it affords assistance to workers in all lines here
represented; by its system of distribution of duplicate specimens
for educational purposes it aids the coming generation all over
the land; by its correspondence it conveys desired information in
response to specific inquiries in many lines; by its publications it
extends the boundaries of learning; and now, by the radio its
service in diffusing knowledge has been extended immeasurably.

COLLECTIONS

The total number of specimens received«by the Museum during
the year was 362,942, exceeding numerically the receipts of the
previous year by over 70 per cent. Not only in numbers is this
year’s increase notable, but in scientific value as well. The incre-
ment is particularly rich in type specimens and in other specially
desired material, filling gaps and otherwise strengthening the col-
lections in many lines. Additional material to the extent of 1,187
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 31

lots, chiefly geological, was received for special examination and
report.

The distribution of duplicates for educational purposes, mainly
to higher schools and colleges, aggregated 8,528 specimens, duly
classified and labeled. Nearly 20,000 specimens and over 90 pounds
of bulk material for blowpipe analyses were sent out, in exchange
for which the Museum has received or will later receive desired
material in many lines. .Nearly 17,000 specimens and some 24
pounds of bulk material were lent to specialists elsewhere for ex-
amination and study.

A résumé of the principal acquisitions of the year follows.

Anthropology.—The department of anthropology reports a favor-
able year, marked by substantial increases in its collections.

In ethnology noteworthy accessions were received from the Philip-
pines, collected by the late Capt. E. Y. Miller, consisting of rattan
fire tongs, bamboo strike-a-lights, decorated gongs, and other ar-
ticles, presented by Mrs. Florence G. Miller; and a considerable
number of specimens from the Araucanian, Aymara, Lengua, and
Chamacoco Indians of South America, gift of D. S. Bullock.

In American archeology is noted an especially valuable collection
of 95 unique ancient earthenware bowls with figures of men and
animals and of group compositions from Mimbres Valley, N. Mex.,
received from the Bureau of American Ethnology. The possibili-
ties of these vessels in the application of decorative art by schools
and manufacturers are great. The collection is also indebted to
Victor J. Evans for the loan of 88 pieces of excellent Casas Grandes
ancient pottery. In Old World archeology there was added a
series of prehistoric antiquities from ancient sites in France, Bel-
gium, and Germany, collected by Dr. AleS Hrdlicka during his
recent trip to Europe. In physical anthropology the most notable
receipt was a large number of skeletal remains from early historic
Arikara Indian village sites near Mobridge, S. Dak., collected by
M. W. Stirling. The collection of musical instruments received
important additions given by Hugo Worch.

The work of the department in installing, rearranging, and pre-
serving specimens was actively carried out. Miss Frances Densmore
prepared a handbook on the collection of musical instruments and
aided in rearranging the exhibit. Among the numerous contacts
of the department with individuals seeking information the talks
given to classes and groups are most valuable and interesting. Many
such talks were given by members of the staff.

Biology.—The collections received by the department of biology
during the year greatly surpass those of the years immediately
preceding, not only numerically but equally so in scientific im-
$2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

portance. The latter point is emphasized by the addition of a large
number of species and genera new to the Museum, many gaps having
been filled and deficiencies supplied. This is particularly noticeable
in the division of birds, where the generosity of Bradshaw H. Swales
has made possible the acquisition of many forms hitherto unrepre-
sented in its collections.

The most outstanding accession of the year is the donation by
Dr. J. M. Aldrich, associate curator of insects, of his private collec-
tion of nearly 45,000 specimens of dipterous flies, representing 4,145
named species and many unnamed, with type material in 534 species,
the fruit of a busy life of collecting and study of these insects by
ene of the leading specialists in this important order.

The activities so auspiciously begun in China, as noted in my
previous report, were continued with gratifying results during the
present year. I have to record with extreme regret the tragic death
of Charles M. Hoy on September 6, 1923, at Kuling, China. It will
be recollected that he was sent to China by Dr. W. L. Abbott for
the purpose of making collections for the National Museum, and it
was during the first trip that the Museum suffered the loss of this
intrepid field naturalist. Rev. D. C. Graham continued his explora-
tions in the western part of the Province of Szechwan. During the
summer of 1923 he made an expedition to Mount Omei and Tat-
sienlu. The collections received contained a large number of topo-
tvnes of species previously described, in addition to many new ones,
some of them from very high altitudes near the Tibetan border.
The National Geographic Society’s expedition under F. R. Wulsin
during 1923 reached the famous Tibetan Lake Kokonor, but the
collections, which are of considerable magnitude, have not been
received as yet. Dr. W. L. Abbott during his expedition to the
island of Santo Domingo during the early winter, though paying
attention chiefly to the Samana region, secured a large number of
plants, reptiles, and amphibians, but the great prize was a series
of skins, skeletons, and embryos representing a genus of rodents
which has not been found alive for nearly 100 years. Dr. Hugh M.
Smith’s activities in Siam, Dr. Casey A. Wood’s visit to the Fiji
Islands, Dr. T. D. A. Cockerell’s expedition to eastern Siberia, and
Secretary Charles D. Walcott’s Canadian expedition also added
materialiy to our collections. Dr. Paul Bartsch and Gerrit S. Miller,
jr., brought back extensive collections from the Bahamas and the
Lesser Antilles, respectively. The National Herbarium was greatly
enriched by three major expeditions to tropical America, namely,
Dr. A. S. Hitchcock’s to Panama, Ecuador, Peru, and Bolivia; Paul
C. Standley’s to the Canal Zone and Costa Rica; and Dr. William R.
Maxon’s to Panama, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 83

The principal work of the taxidermists during the year has been
the dismantling of one of the largest and oldest of the biologicat
groups in the North American mammal hall, namely, that of the
Rocky Mountain goats. The mounting of the animals for the new
group, which have been collected for a number of seasons by Doctor
and Mrs. Walcott during their explorations in the Canadian Rockies,
has been practically finished and a fair beginning made on the rock
work and other accessories. The arrangement, cataloguing, and in-
stallation of the large material received from collectors in the field
has cost much time and labor, but good progress has been made and
the condition of the study collections is considered very good.

As usual the Museum is under great obligations to a great number
of scientific men connected with universities, museums, and other
institutions all over the country and abroad, for working up such
parts of the collections as are not represented by specialists on the
staff of the National Museum. The research work of the members
of the scientific staff has continued during such time as could be
spared from the routine work, and some important memoirs have
been concluded and published during the year, but the divisions are
greatly undermanned, and more scientific work of a high order
could be accomplished were more assistants available. With the in-
crease in the number of accessions, the opportunity for research
work becomes less.

Naturalists visiting Washington for the purpose of examining the
collections have been given the widest and most liberal assistance in
pursuing their studies, and loans of specimens to scientific institu-
tions and individual investigators in this country and abroad have
been made freely as heretofore. Zoological and botanical duplicates
distributed to high schools, colleges, institutions, etc., aggregated
4,194 specimens, of which 2,086 consisted of mollusks in 14 prepared
sets, and 800 fishes in 9 sets. Exchanges to the number of 14,526
were sent out, of which 2,737 were zoological.

The total number of specimens of animals and plants now in the
collections is estimated at 7,206,816, of which 1,183,700 are plants.

Geology.—The year 1923-24 is notable chiefly on account of the
unusual amount and value for both exhibition and study of the
material received, a total of 227 geological accessions, aggregating
159,921 specimens, being recorded. The paleontological collections
were the chief beneficiaries, the most noteworthy of the accessions
being the large sauropodous dinosaur from the Dinosaur National
Monument, Utah, and the Edgar E. Teller and George M. Austin
collections of fossils, the last two named comprising at least 125,000:
of the total number of specimens received.

The economic collections have been increased by Canadian nickel
and silver ores acquired mainly through the interest of Honorary
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Curator Frank L. Hess, although an instructive series of copper-
nickel-silver ores was donated by the Royal Ontario Museum of
Mineralogy. <A series of diamond-bearing rocks from the Arkansas
fields, received through the assistance of H. D. Miser, made possible
a more comprehensive exhibit of the occurrence of the diamond than
was heretofore shown.

The continued activities of Victor C. Heikes have resulted in the
acquisition of good exhibition material to both economic and min-
eral collections. .

An unusual meteoric iron from San Juan County, N. Mex., formed
the most interesting accession to the meteorite collection, although
an iron from Chile, stone from Kansas, and small quantities of other
individuals from Spain and Australia added new falls and finds.
These were all acquired by exchanges.

The chief contributor to the mineral collections was Col. Wash-
ington A. Roebling, who supplied funds for the purchase of new
minerals and made other gifts. Radium-bearing minerals from the
Belgian Congo and a number of rare species new to the collections,
received as gifts and exchanges, may also be noted. The mineral
collection is reported as now 80 per cent complete in species.

A number of cut gems were added to the Isaac Lea collection
through the Frances Lea Chamberlain fund.

A petrographic reference series of rocks, numbering some 2,000
specimens, and thought to be without doubt the most important col-
lection, from a scientific standpoint, now in existence, was trans-
ferred by the United States Geological Survey.

In addition to the paleontological material mentioned above, col-
lections of Cambrian, Ordovician and Silurian invertebrates were
made by Secretary Walcott and members of the staff of the depart-
ment, and a quantity of foreign material was acquired through gifts
and exchanges. A slab of fossil footprints from the Triassic shales
of Virginia, received through the courtesy of F. C. Littleton, was
added to the exhibits.

Satisfactory progress was made in the care of the collections,
though a few changes are to be noted in the exhibits, the installation
of mastodon and bison skeletons, a large slab of rhinoceros bones,
and the slab showing footprints of a dinosaur being the most im-
portant. Expansion of the study series has occupied much of the
time of the curators and their assistants. Research work, however,
has progressed to the usual extent and has been greatly facilitated
by the acquisition of a binocular microscope which was presented to
the department by John A. Roebling.

Mineral technology and mechanical technology.—These divisions
are concerned with engineering developments generally and their
industrial application. The collections endeavor to visualize by
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 85

models and original objects the progress made in the mechanical and
electrical fields, in mineral resource industries, and in transportation
industries on land, water, and in the air. For some unexplained
reason in past years these collections have been augmented spas-
modically, all accessions recorded in any one year being concerned
with a single one or two of the divisions’ activities. This year, how-
ever, the accessions recorded, while but a little higher numerically,
ceteris the collections of every one of the fee in the divisions.
Thus in mineral technology the glass industry exhibit was brought
considerably closer to completion through the generosity of the Corn-
ing Glass Works. Two models of the most recent types of melting
furnaces were presented as well as typical examples of chemical,
industrial, and household oven glassware. The Cadillac Motor Co.
presented one of the first automobiles made by that company in
1903 and also one of its cars made in 1923, the latter being sectioned,
making visible car parts normally hidden from view.

The Automatic Electric Co. donated a complete working unit of
the Strowger automatic telephone system. In this instance the ex-
hibition case is equipped with three telephones which the visitor may
operate and at the same time observe the functioning of the various
parts. To the section of aeronautics there were added the Fokker
T-2 monoplane, which flew in May, 1923, from New York to San
Francisco in a nonstop flight of less than 27 hours, and a helicopter
type of airplane with which Emile Berliner and his son made suc-
cessful flights at College Park, Md., in 1923. The water-craft col-
lections were increased first by the addition of a model of the
steamship Leviathan, transferred from the Alien Property Cus-
todian, and second through the courtesy of the Canadian Pacific
Railway Co., Montreal, Canada, in lending a model of the steam-
ship Lmpress of Russia, one of the vessels of this company plying
between Vancouver and the Orient.

As far as cooperative educational work is concerned, the lecture
work of S. S. Wyer, associate in mineral technology, was of greatest
importance. During the year he delivered 89 lectures on the subjects
of fuel and power resources before many of the schools, normal
schools, and colleges in Pennsylvania and before several educational
groups outside of that State.

Textiles, wood technology, organic chemistry, foods, and medi-
cine.—The collections under the supervision of the curator of tex-
tiles, which, besides textiles, embrace wood technology, foods, organic
chemistry, and medicine, were increased by many gifts and by trans-
fer of property from other Government bureaus, amounting to over
3,200 objects. The most important of these may be mentioned briefly.

Several large series of industrial specimens illustrating every
branch of rubber manufacture, the manufacture of leather and
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

shoes, and the preparation and dyeing of seal, muskrat, and rabbit
skins, were added to the collections, through cooperation with na-
tional trade associations. Exhibits were presented which show the
manufacture and use of new materials from the field of industrial
chemistry and include synthetic plastics and hot-molded and cold-
molded compositions having high dielectric properties. These ma-
terials are used in the manufacture of electric equipment, auto-
mobile parts, musical instruments, ete. Other chemical exhibits
received during the year include glues, coal-tar dyes, and artificial
silk. The textile collections were increased by the gift of fibers,
silk and cotton dress and drapery fabric, and a large series of hand-
~ woven textiles; also hand looms and a commercial braiding machine.
To the collections arranged to show the importance of wood and the
industries based thereon were added products of the hardwood dis-
tillation industry, veneered doors, sporting goods made of wood, and
paper-pulp products. The collections in the division of medicine
were enlarged by 25 models showing advances in sanitary science,
specimens of materia medica, and objects associated with the history
of medicine in America.

Graphic arts—The division of graphic arts held throughout the
year successful temporary exhibitions of artistic prints, etchings,
lithographs, and photographs, which were well attended and favor-
ably mentioned in the press both here and abroad.

The two traveling exhibits of graphic arts were continually in
demand, being singing ed in 18 cities in 9 different States, and the fall
and winter are already well dated up.

No entirely new and complete exhibit for the permanent collec-
tions was received, but important additions were made, especially
to that of letterpress printing and to etching, the latter subject
having been entirely rearranged with numerous additions, the most
important of which was Miss Beatrice S. Levy’s gift of three
aquatint plates for her color print, White House by the Sea. This
method is new to the technical series. The division now has all the
regular methods of printing etchings in color.

Probably the most important accession received by the section
of photography was the motion-picture camera invented by Wallace
Goold Levison in 1887. This machine could expose 12 plates in
rapid succession from one point. This is probably the first motion-
picture camera ever made. Edward Muybridge did not have a
motion-picture camera but had a row of separate cameras, each ex-
posed as the person or animal passed in front, by the breaking of a
string.

History.—The most notable addition to the historical collection
was a number of objects comprising the interior furnishings of an
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 87

American colonial room, presented to the Museum by Mrs. Gertrude
D. Ritter, of Washington, D.C. This collection includes wall panel-
ing, furniture, chinawure, glassware, pewter ware, pictures, textiles.
and miscellaneous objects. The wall paneling, made of American
pine carved with plain designs and fastened with pegs, was taken
intact from the old Bliss homestead located at Springfield, Mass., and
includes a corner cupboard of three shelves with original glass doors
and hinges and latches of wrought iron. In the cupboard and on
the tables are shown the china, glass, and pewter ware belonging to
the exhibit. The china includes an exceptionally beautiful bowl of
Chinese Lowestoft and a child’s tea set of the same ware, a helmet
pitcher, and a number of pieces of luster ware of more than usual
interest. The glassware includes several pieces of Stiegel ware, a
number of plain glass mugs of antique design, a glass pitcher, and a
number of glass bottles of rare types. The collection of pewter in-
cludes plates, mugs, coffee pots, pepper and salt shakers, dishes,
sirup mug, and basin. This collection is unique in character and its
presentation marks an epoch in the development of the collections of
this type in the National Museum. It is the donor’s intention to
add to this collection until the furnishings of an entire colonial home
have thus been assembled. These will be exhibited as a unit in a
house of colonial style to be erected for the purpose in proximity to
the present group of museum buildings.

To the collection of costumes of the ladies of the White House,
which has for a number of years attracted so much public attention,
were added two costumes of great interest. One of these is a white
satin evening gown worn by Mrs. Warren G. Harding during the
administration of her husband, President Warren G. Harding, 1921-
1923, the gift of Mrs. Harding. The other is a gray sill dress worn
by Mrs. Benjamin Harrison at the inaugural ball in 1889 on the
occasion of the inauguration of her husband, President Benjamin
Harrison, and donated by Mrs. James R. McKee, of New York City.
Both these costumes were acquired by the Museum through the gen-
erous cooperation of Mrs. Rose G. Hoes.

The biographical collections were increased by the gift of a pair
of silver-mounted flintlock pistols with leather holsters which were
owned during the War of the Revolution by Maj. Gen. Charles Lee,
of the Continental Army; a sword, a pair of pistols, and a pair of
epaulets owned during the same period by Maj. Jacob Morris, and a
number of other relics of less importance. These were presented to
the Museum by Victor Morris through the Wisconsin Society of
the Colonial Dames of America. Three silver camp cups owned
during the Revolution by Brig. Gen. Anthony Wayne were lent by
Mrs. M. W. Stroud. A gold locket containing a lock of the hair
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of Napoleon I was presented by H. deB. Parsons, Miss Katharine
deB. Parsons, and Livingston Parsons, of New York City. <A very
handsome gold snuftbox, the lid of which is set with diamonds, which
was presented about 1836 to Col. René E. De Russy, United States
Army, by the Prince de Joinville, was donated to the Museum by
Mrs. Laura R. De Russy, of New York City. A silver tureen and
platter presented to the Hon. James R. Mann, Republican leader, by
Members of the United States House of Representatives, Sixty-fifth
Congress, March 3, 1919, were donated by Mrs. Mann.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

The Museum draws its increment in large measure from explora-
tions and expeditions undertaken chiefly by other Government agen-
cies and by private institutions and individuals. This year the
Museum benefited from an unusual number of such enterprises.
Biological and botanical explorations in North America, Central
America, South America, Asia, and various islands added to the
collections representing the fauna and flora of various countries,
while geological field work was carried on within the borders of our
own continent.

During the summer and early fall of 1923 Secretary Walcott, ac-
companied and aided by Mrs. Walcott, was engaged on geological
exploration in the Canadian Rockies in continuation of the work
of previous years. Special studies were made of the Mons forma-
tion of the Ozarkian system, 3,800 feet in thickness, which on the
eastern side of the Columbia River Valley was found to contain
four well-developed fossil faunas, indicating its position between
the Upper Cambrian and Ordovician systems of the geologic time
scale. Collections of fossils illustrating new horizons in the Ozark-
ian system were made in this area, also in the Upper Cambrian and
Silurian limestone of this region, together with small lots of desir-
able biological and botanical material.

Biological explorations in China included the expedition of the
National Geographic Society under Mr. Wulsin along the ‘Yellow
River to Lake Kokonor in Thibet and the field work of Mr. Graham
in the Province of Szechwan, and of Mr. Hoy in Hunan, all before
mentioned. Mr. Graham in his trip to Tatsienlu practically dupli-
cated the route of A. E. Pratt, going by way of Mount Omei, secur-
ing topotype material of species based on Pratt’s and Potanin’s ex-
peditions as well as undescribed material which had escaped his
predecessors.

Arthur de C. Sowerby continued his collecting in China for the
Museum, under the auspices of Col. Robert Sterling Clark, but on
account of the disturbed conditions in that country he was unable
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 39

to go far afield from his headquarters in Shanghai. The resulting
valuable additions furnish serial material for comparison with col-
lections from more remote regions.

An expedition to Japan and eastern Siberia undertaken by Prof.
T. D. A. Cockerell at his own expense, primarily for the purpose of
collecting and studying insects, was productive of large collections
in that class with smaller lots in other natural history classes.

In Siam, Dr. Hugh M. Smith, who is engaged in fisheries investi-
gations for the Government of Siam, collected in a number of local-
ities birds, reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates, important as link-
ing up collections already in the Museum from the Malay Archi-
pelago and Peninsula with those of the countries farther north.

In the Fiji Islands Dr. Casey A. Wood, a valued collaborator of
the division of birds, enlisted the cooperation of several native col-
lectors during a three months’ visit, making very important addi-
tions of birds from that region, including many species hitherto un-
represented, a notable addition to the Fijian material from the
United States exploring expedition under Captain Wilkes. Doctor
Wood arranged with his local assistants to continue the work in
localities he himself was unable to visit.

Under the auspices of the Bureau of Biological Survey, Depart-
ment of Agriculture, in conjunction with the Navy Department, Dr.
Alexander Wetmore visited Laysan, Midway, Johnson, Wake, and
other islands in the Pacific and made large collections, part of
which have already been transferred to the Museum.

Islands in the Atlantic were also visited. Dr. W. L. Abbott’s
expedition to Santo Domingo has already been mentioned, with its
prized specimens of the long-lost rodent. In the Virgin Islands of
the United States and the Lesser Antilles, Gerrit S. Miller, jr., cura-
tor of mammals, made extensive collections of animals and plants
for the Museum at his own expense. Explorations in the Bahamas,
Cuba, and the Florida Keys in August, 1923, and June, 1924, in
connection with experiments in heredity which Dr. Paul Bartsch of
the Museum staff is conducting under the joint auspices of the
Carnegie Institution of Washington and the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, added to the Museum series of mollusks, birds and other
natural history specimens from these regions. The United States
Navy and the United States Army cooperated by furnishing trans-
portation for the workers.

The expedition of A. H. Fisher to the lower Amazon River, Bra-
zil, on which the Museum was represented by C. R. Aschemeier as
mentioned in the last report, was completed early in the year. The
collections made in this region included a few species of mammals
and birds new to the Museum.
40 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Under an arrangement with R. O. Marsh, John L. Baer repre-
sented the Museum on the Marsh Darien expedition undertaken in
the early part of 1924, for collecting anthropological material in a
region poorly represented in the anthropological collections. As
mentioned elsewhere, Mr. Baer died while on this trip and the
collections have not as yet reached the Museum.

Botanical explorations in northern South America conducted
under the auspices of the United States Department of Agriculture,
the Gray Herbarium, and the New York Botanical Garden benefited
the National Herbarium. Dr. A. S. Hitchcock, custodian of grasses,
on this exploration spent four months in Ecuador, two months in
Peru, six weeks in Bolivia, and a few days in Panama. Large col-
lections were obtained, of which a set of approximately 1,700 speci-
mens, exclusive of grasses, was deposited in the National Herbarium.

Two expeditions undertaken for the Bureau of Entomology of
the United States Department of Agriculture by Dr. William M.
Mann, assistant custodian of Hymenoptera in the Museum, resulted
in collections of insects and also specimens in other classes. The
first three months of the fiscal year were spent in Mexico collecting
miscellaneous insects and four months in the spring of 1924 in
Panama, Colombia, Guatemala, Costa Rica, and Honduras, collect-
ing insects, especially ants.

Another very considerable miscellaneous collection from Guate-
mala, of which birds formed the conspicuous part, was obtained by
Harry Malleis, who visited the Province of Petén for the Bureau
of Biological Survey, primarily to obtain living specimens of the
ocellated turkey for introduction into this country.

During the spring of 1923 Dr. H. G. Dyar, custodian of Lepidop-
tera, made a trip to Panama, financed by himself, in company with
R. C. Shannon, of the Bureau of Entomology of the United States
Department of Agriculture, whose expenses were paid by that bu-
reau, resulting in many thousand insects, including extensive collec-
tions of mosquitoes, in which Doctor Dyar was specially interested.
Dr. T. E. Snyder, of the Bureau of Entomology, also visited Pan-
ama, securing large collections of termites which will be added to the
National material.

An expedition from the Department of Agriculture to Panama
and Central America was accompanied by Dr. William R. Maxon,
associate curator of plants, the field work in Panama, western Nica-
ragua, and Costa Rica resulting in 4,500 botanical specimens. The
Nicaraguan material will be especially useful in the preparation of
the proposed flora of Central America.

The Panama Canal Zone and Costa Rica were visited also by Paul
C. Standley, associate curator of plants, the expense of the explora-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 41

tions being borne in part by the Department of Agriculture and by
Oakes Ames, who is especially interested in the orchids of Central
America. During two months in the Canal Zone there were ob-
tained about 7,000 numbers of plants particularly desired in prepar-
ing a popular flora of the zone, and 8,000 numbers, including a large
percentage of orchids, were collected during 10 weeks in Costa Rica
for use in preparing the flora of all Central America.

An expedition to the west coast of the United States under Dr.
H. G. Dyar was in the field at the close of the year, studying larve
of mosquitoes. This was financed by Doctor Dyar. Dr. J. M. Al-
drich, associate curator of insects, was likewise at the close of the
year collecting Diptera throughout the high altitudes of the West
and on the west coast of the United States and Canada. All of this
material will eventually find its way into the National collections.

During the summer of 1923 the National Geographic Society con-
tinued archeological explorations at the prehistoric Pueblo Bonito
in New Mexico under Neil M. Judd of the Museum staff. The ma-
terial results have not as yet been officially turned over to the Mu-
seum. This was the third season of explorations which are planned
to extend over a period of five summers. Mr. Judd had just started
the fourth season’s work at the close of the fiscal year.

A second expedition under the same auspices, also directed by Mr.
Judd, penetrated a previously unexplored section of southeastern
Utah, bringing back objects from basket-maker and cliff-dweller
habitations.

The expedition to the Dinosaur National Monument, Utah, under-
taken by C. W. Gilmore, assisted by N. H. Boss, as mentioned in last
year’s report, was completed in the middle of the summer of 1923.
This had for its object the procuring of one of the large dinosaurs
for the exhibition collections. As noted under the chapter on acces-
sions, sufficient material was acquired for a good skeletal mount of
Diplodocus, exceeding in exhibition value anything acquired in the
department of geology in recent years, together with a considerable
quantity of miscellaneous fossils representative of the Morrison
fauna.

The Great Basin ranges of Nevada and Utah were the subject of
stratigraphic and paleontologic work by Dr. Charles E. Resser in
furtherance of Doctor Walcott’s monographic studies. Of the fos-
sils collected many were from entirely new localities.

Field work by Dr. R. S. Bassler, curator of stratigraphic paleon-
tology, during the year included four separate projects: (1) Field
work in the Central Basin of Tennessee, in cooperation with the
State Geological Survey, which resulted in completing the :map-
ping of the geology of the Hollow Springs quadrangle and in
42 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

securing fossils from that area; (2) in southern Kentucky, at the
instance of Dr. Frank Springer, in search of crinoids; (3) in the
Niagaran Plain and neighboring area in Ohio, obtaining information
as to the region from which the Austin collection was secured; and
(4) in northern Tennessee, again under the geological survey of
that State, mapping the geology and securing data toward a report
on the stratigraphy of the State.

The Upper Cambrian and Ozarkian systems, particularly in Wis--
consin, were the subject of the field work in the summer of 1923 of
Dr. E. O. Ulrich, associate in paleontology.

The reported discovery of fossil footprints on excavations in the
red Triassic shale near Aldie, Va., were investigated by C. W. Gil-
more, and numerous dinosaurian footprints were observed at several
distinct horizons. <A fine slab of these was obtained.

Shorter collecting trips to the Miocene deposits along Chesapeake
Bay by N. H. Boss and to near-by localities by E. V. Shannon and
W. F. Foshag provided well-preserved cetacean remains from the
former and small representative collections of rocks, minerals, and
ores from the latter.

The quarries at Deer Isle and Auburn, Me., were inspected by
Dr. George P. Merrill, head curator of geology, who also made a
geological trip into the northern part of that State.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

For some years an additional building to house the National
Gallery of Art and the history collections of the United States
National Museum has been urgently needed. The removal of the
art and history collections would release space in the older buildings
that should provide for the growth of the other collections for years
to come. The executive and independent offices act for 1924, ap-
proved February 13, 1923, authorizes the Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution to prepare preliminary plans for a suitable fire-
proof building with granite fronts for the National Gallery of Art
(including the National Portrait Gallery) and for the history collec-
tions of the United States National Museum, to be erected when
funds from gifts or bequests are in the possession of the regents.
A site for the building is designated in the Mall immediately east of
the Natural History Building.

The National Gallery of Art Commission, which has for some time
been giving consideration to the adequate housing of the art collec-
tions, decided at a meeting on December 11, 1923, to raise by private
subscription $10,000 toward preliminary plans for this art and
history building, and that amount was soon subscribed. The Board
of Regents of the Institution accordingly on February 14, 1924,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 48

selected Charles A. Platt, of New York City, on the recommendation
of the commission, as the architect to prepare preliminary plans for
the proposed building. It will be recalled that Mr. Platt was the
architect of the Freer Gallery of Art. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge
proposed an amendment to the second deficiency bill on April 17,
1924, appropriating $2,500,000 to begin construction of a building
the total cost of which should be $7,000,000, but this failed to be
enacted into law. It is to be hoped that favorable action will be
taken in the next session of Congress.

The various buildings housing Museum collections have by the
exercise of the strictest economy been maintained in good condition.
The usual repairs were made to walls, ceilings, and roofs, and to
portions of the roadway on the east of the Natural History Build-
ing. The café in the Arts and Industries Building was closed for
the last two weeks in May and given a needed thorough renovation.
Other changes in the same building afforded better accommodations
for checking umbrellas, for the public-telephone booth, and for the
watch service, and better illumination under the galleries.

The heating season was two weeks longer than the preceding one,
consuming 3,267.2 tons of bituminous coal and 15.8 tons of stove
coal, the former at ‘an average cost of $7.79 per ton against $9.06
the preceding year. Minor repairs of the power plant and adjust-
ments permitted the buildings to be more satisfactorily heated than
in previous years. The electric generating equipment for the first
time since the installation of the power plant has carried a load
approximating its maximum capacity, due to natural increase in
demand for current, as well as the addition of the Freer Building.
The electric feeder leading into the Natural History Building from
the Government contractor’s line in B Street was enlarged to care
for this increased load.

The ice plant produced 301.1 tons of ice, at a cost of $3.003 per ton,
exclusive of labor. During the summer of 1923 it was unable to
produce sufficient ice to meet the demands of all the buildings in the
Smithsonian group. Repairs and renovation in the spring of 1924
made its output meet the demand to the close of the fiscal year.

The Museum fire-fighting equipment was given its customary
regular inspections and tests, and it is expected that all deficiencies
will be remedied shortly. Congress has provided for additional fire
protection for the Smithsonian and National Museum Buildings by
an item in the executive and independent offices act approved June
7, 1924, and arrangements have been made with the Commissioners
of the District of Columbia for the installation in the Smithsonian
Park of additional modern fire hydrants.

The Museum, in connection with the transfer of the Government
collection of coins and medals from the Philadelphia Mint, acquired
the exhibition cases in which the collection had been displayed. The
44 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

cases were built to fit a special octagonal room in the Philadelphia
Mint. They consisted of four wall cases, of three sections each,
built to fit the angular spaces, and a central case—a double-faced
polygon of 14 units, access to the interior fronts of which is through
the space which would have formed a fifteenth unit had the polygo-
nal construction been completed. By shifting the historical col-
lection, the west north range of the Arts and Industries Building
was assigned to the collection from the mint, together with other
similar material already in the custody of the Museum. The dis-
mantling of the highly finished, many angled cases in Philadelphia
and their reerection here reflect great credit upon the Museum cab-
inetmakers and their associates in the undertaking.

There were constructed in the Museum workshops also 13 exhibi-
tion cases and bases and 119 pieces of storage and laboratory furni-
ture. In addition 10 items of storage, laboratory, office, and other
furniture were procured by contract.

MEETINGS AND RECEPTIONS

The National Museum is prevented by its limited maintenance
funds from providing public lectures, as it would like to do, on the
many subjects in which it is interested. It is always ready, how-
ever, to assist as far as possible other governmental, scientific, and
local organizations which so disseminate knowledge.

The auditorium and council rooms served for 105 meetings during
the year, all of which were as usual open to the public. These
gatherings included the National Conference on Outdoor Recrea-
tion called by President Coolidge, which met in the Museum from
May 22 to 24; the nineteenth annual meeting of the American As-
sociation of Museums, May 10 to 13; the twenty-third annual con-
vention of the National Association of Postmasters, October 10-12;
one session on September 3 of the twenty-fourth annual convention
of the United National Association of Post Office clerks; the meet-
ing of the Northern Nut Growers Association, September 26-28;
the meeting of adjutants general of the National Guard of each
State, under the auspices of the Militia Bureau, War Department;
two motion-picture exhibitions by the Public Health Service; a
three-day plant quarantine conference of State and Federal repre-
sentatives and an all-day conference on the Japanese beetle and the
Almeria grape, both under the Federal Horticultural Board; a con-
ference on conservation of the prong-horned antelope, under the
Biological Survey; two meetings with addresses before employees
of the Forest Service; a motion-picture exhibition by the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and a lecture by the Secretary of Agriculture
before the American Committee on the International Institute of
Agriculture; one session of the National Conference on Vocational
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 45

Rehabilitation of Civilian Disabled, under the Federal Board of
Vocational Education; a series of health lectures by emi-
nent physicians arranged by The Woman’s Welfare Associa-
tion on alternate Sunday afternoons from January 13 to April
97, inclusive; the celebration by the Shakespeare Society of Wash-
ington of the tercentenary (1623-1923) of the publication of the
first folio of Shakespearean plays on November 7 and 8, and a bene-
fit for the National Monticello Association by the same society on
December 12; the fifth annual meeting of the American Classical
League; a series of lectures for Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts; the
regular meetings of the 1923-24 season of the Anthropological So-
ciety of Washington, the Entomological Society of Washington, the
American Horticultural Society, and the Washington (D. C.) Chap-
ter of the Wild Flower Preservation Society of America; two
meetings by the Audubon Society of the District of Columbia; and
single meetings under the auspices of the Washington Society of
Engineers, the Writers’ League of Washington, the Southern Mary-
land Immigration Commission for the purpose of organizing a gar-
den home association, the Potomac Garden Club, the Light Bear-
ers of Washington, the Puerto Rico Society of Washington, Fed-
eral Post No. 824 of the Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United
States, the Federal Photographic Society, and the Smithsonian
Relief Association.

The exhibition halls were opened for four evening receptions. On
November 13 a reception was tendered to the delegates and
friends of the Southern Medical Association, then holding its seven-
teenth annual meeting in Washington. On January 22 the Archae-
ological Society of Washington, affiliated with the Archaelog-
ical Institute of America, arranged for a reception in the space
assigned the Nationa] Gallery or Art, immediately following a lec-
ture in the auditorium by Count Byron Kuhn de Prorok on “ Ex-
cavations in Carthage.” On April 22 the regents gave a reception
to the members and friends of the American Chemical Society, as 2.
part of their spring meeting in Washington, April 21-25, which
was unusually well attended. On May 22 the first floor and the
foyer rooms on the ground floor were thrown open for the reception
to the delegates to the National Conference on Outdoor Recreation.

MISCELLANEOUS

The number of visitors to the Natural History Building during
the year aggregated 540,776; to the Arts and Industries Building,
290,012; to the Aircraft Building, 43,534; and to the Museum ex-
hibition halls in the Smithsonian Building, 104,601.

As a mark of respect to President Warren G. Harding, all tho
exhibition halls, as well as the offices, were closed at noon, August 8.
46 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

1923, for the balance of that day, and again from 1 p. m. on August
7 until after the funeral at Marion, Ohio, on August 10. Visitors
were also denied entrance to the Aircraft Building from January 11,
1924, to February 4, to permit of the installation of the Fokker air-
plane 7-2.

The Museum published 8 volumes and 44 separate papers during
the year. A publication in the bulletin series of several years ago,
“The Mineral Industries of the United States—Manufactured Gas in
the Home,” was reprinted for a second time through the financial
assistance of the author, Samuel S. Wyer. Museum publications to
the number of 78,734 copies were distributed by the Museum to
libraries and individuals on the regular mailing lists and in response
to special requests. The distribution exceeds the number of copies
printed during the year by nearly 1,000. Some 250,000 labels, repre-
senting nearly 1,100 forms, were also printed, and 163 books were
bound for the library.

The Museum is more and more dependent upon donations and
exchanges in building up its library, since the number of books it can
purchase with its small book appropriation is constantly dwindling.

Books are very necessary tools in the classification as required by
law of objects intrusted to its custody. The additions to the Museum
library this year comprised 1,521 volumes and 2,667 pamphlets,
making a total of 164,748 titles in the library. The number of loans
made was 10,577, of which 6,139 went to the sectional libraries of the
Museum.

Three members of the staff left the Museum through the opera-
tion of the retirement act: W. I. Adams, disbursing agent for nearly
20 years, with service in another bureau of the institution aggre-
gating 28 years in all; Joseph Horan, sergeant of watch, with a serv-
ice of 42 years; and A. F. Adams, classifier in the library, whose
retirement, granted in October, 1923, was effective from June 2, 1921,
with a service of 39 years.

The necrology for the year included Miss E. D. Tabler, clerk for
nearly 41 years; J. J. Dolan, who served in various capacities for
32 years; George W. Spier, honorary custodian of watches; John L.
Baer, Museum representative on the Marsh Darien expedition ; and
Charles M. Hoy, a field naturalist collecting in China for the
Museum through the generosity of Dr. W. L. Abbott. The Museum
also lost by death a number of its long-time benefactors, including
Rev. Alfred Duane Pell and Ralph Cross Johnson.

APPENDIX 2
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the affairs
of the National Gallery of Art for the year ending June 30, 1924:

The fourth year of the existence of the National Gallery as a sep-
arate administrative unit of the Smithsonian Institution has wit-
nessed substantial advance in directions corresponding closely with
those of preceding years, although its activities have been restricted
by the lack of funds for the purchase of works of art, for travel and
for active promotion. The staff, limited to two members, has been
occupied largely in the current work of the gallery, with receiving,
recording, cataloguing and installing collections, permanent and
temporary. A number of important works were received during
the year notwithstanding the fact that the gallery is without suit-
able space for the display of additional exhibits. The discourage-
ment due to the shortage of gallery accommodations is, however,
greatly lessened by the well-grounded expectation that additions of
great importance await only the fulfilling of stipulated conditions
and by the further reasonable expectation that when the contem-
plated gallery building is completed progress will be greatly
accelerated.

During the year constant effort has been made to impress upon the.
country the urgent need of a national gallery building, without
which little progress can be made. A majority of the art works
now owned by the Nation have been acquired simply because there
happened to be available gallery space in the Natural History
Museum in which collectors could see their treasures properly in-
stalled. Although Congress, in 1921, set aside an appropriate site
for a gallery building, it was left to the Institution to obtain the
funds necessary for the employment of an architect to prepare the
plans and for the erection of the building. As the result of an
appeal for the former purpose $11,000 was raised and Mr. Charles
A. Platt was engaged on the plans, this work being under way at
the close of the year. It is feared, however, that funds for the
erection of the building can not be obtained in this way, since the
people incline to the view that the Nation should provide a building
required for purely national purposes.

It is anticipated that Congress will in the near future come to feel
the urgent need of a home for the valuable works of art that patri-

47
48 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

otic citizens have contributed to the Nation and for the still richer
contributions that may be confidently expected when a gallery build-
ing worthy of the Nation is provided. The need of an additional
building in the Smithsonian group is strongly emphasized by the
fact that this building when completed will be called upon to
accommodate not only the arts of painting, sculpture, architecture,
and all the other arts in which the esthetic is a dominant feature
but the extensive collections of the department of American history
which now encroach so lamentably on the space rightfully claimed
by the scientific departments of geology, anthropology, archeology, |
and natural history.

The recent introduction in the United States Senate by Senator
Lodge of an amendment to the deficiency appropriations bill pro-
viding for a gallery building gives gratifying assurance of the
awakening of public interest in national art. The amendment of-
fered is as follows:

To enable the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution to commence the erec-
tion of a suitable fireproof building with granite fronts for the National Gal-
lery of Art, including the National Portrait Gallery and the history collections
of the United States National Museum, on the north side of the Mall between
the Natural History Building and Seventh Street, $2,500,000: Provided, That
the total cost of said building complete, including heating and ventilation ap-
paratus and elevators, shall not exceed $7,000,000.

Among the agencies engaged in promoting the gallery’s interests
the American Federation of Arts has taken a leading place. The
task of arousing the people to a realization of the backwardness of
the art side of American culture development is intrusted to the
360 chapters of the Federation distributed widely throughout the
States. In like manner illustrated lectures have been widely pre-
sented, two sets of colored lantern slides illustrating the gallery
collections being in extended use, one under the auspices of the Fed-
eration of Arts and the other of the Federation of Women’s Clubs.
Radio broadcasting has also been utilized with good effect.

NATIONAL GALLERY COMMISSION

The third annual meeting of the National Gallery Commission was
held in the regents’ room of the Smithsonian Institution, December
11, 1923, the following members being present: Herbert Adams, W.
K.. Bixby, Joseph H. Gest, John E. Lodge, Gari Melchers, Charles
Moore, James Parmelee, Charles D. Walcott, and William H.
Holmes.

The secretary of the commission presented a report on the activi-
ties of the gallery for the year and reports of the standing and
special committees followed.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 49

A number of important topics presented for consideration by the
commission were gone over in all necessary detail. It was stated
by the secretary that the war portrait collection, after two years’
circulation by the American Federation of Arts, had been returned
to the gallery and placed on exhibition in association with the
World War exhibits.

The committee appointed by the commission in 1922 to advise with
the committee on the purchase of works from the Ranger fund,
Messrs. Redfield, Melchers, and Holmes, made no report, but it was
announced that during the year 11 purchases were made from this
fund none of which, however, were assigned to the National Gallery.

Attention was given to the resolution submitted by the regents,
February 8, 1923, requesting consideration of the suggestion of cer-
tain architects that a museum of architecture be founded in connec-
tion with the Institution. After discussion, the following resolution
was adopted:

Resolved, That the Commission of the National Gallery of Art recommend
to the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution the inclusion of a division of
historical architecture in the National Gallery of Art. The division should
seek to establish standards in architecture, furniture, and landscape archi-
tecture for the benefit of students and others interested in the preservation of
the historic buildings of America.

Extended consideration was given to the important problem of a
national gallery building, as to its character as the prospective joint
home of national art and national history, and as to the raising of
funds for the construction of a building worthy of its purpose and
of the American Nation. The various agencies that might be en-
listed in the work were reviewed, and the impression prevailed that
obtaining funds for the purpose by subscription was not within the
range of feasibility. The possible adaptation of the George Wash-
ington Memorial Building, now in course of construction, to the
purposes of art and history was suggested.

It was agreed that the first and essential step was the preparation
of plans for the proposed structure, and the raising of a fund for the
purpose was considered. Discussion led to the announcement by a
member of the commission that he would be responsible for one half
of the amount required when the other half ‘is raised. Another
member indicated that he would gladly help, and a committee of
three—Mr. Parmelee, Mr. Moore, and Mr. Walcott—was appointed
to take charge of the task of completing the fund.

The election of officers and members of the commission and mem-
bers of the committees followed. The resignation of Mr. Daniel C.
French as a member of the commission was announced, and Mr.
Gari Melchers was selected to succeed him as chairman of the com-
50 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

mission. Owing to the nonacceptance of election to membership
on the commission of Mr. Denman Ross, Mr. James E. Fraser was
elected to fill his place, and owing to a wrong understanding of the
resignation of Mr. French, which was intended merely as resignation
as chairman of the commission and not from membership in the com-
mission, Mr. Joseph E. Breck was selected to fill the supposed
vacancy. Mr. Breck, however, declined the appointment, making
possible the restoration of Mr. French to the commission from which
his resignation had been accepted under a misapprehension.

A special meeting of the gallery commission was held in the
Regents’ room of the Institution February 11, 1924, to consider the
report of the committee appointed at the December 11 meeting of
the commission to complete the raising of the $10,000 fund estimated
as required for the preparation of preliminary plans for a national
gallery building. Six members of the commission were present—
Gari Melchers, James Parmelee, Herbert Adams, Charles Moore,
Charles D. Walcott, and W. H. Holmes. The funds committee of
three, Messrs. Parmelee, Moore, and Walcott, reported that $11,000
had been subscribed. The commission then proceeded to consider
the question of the character of the proposed building, after which,
complying with the request of the Board of Regents of the Institu-
tion, a vote was taken on the selection of an architect to prepare
plans. The vote of members present, supplemented later by votes of
those not present at the meeting, resulted in the naming of Charles
A. Platt.

The advisory committee on acceptance of works of art met on
December 15, 1923, and the following works, received subsequently
to the previous annual meeting but in large part listed in the annual
report for 1923, were favorably considered: Twenty-two paintings
in pastel, comprising 71 portraits of survivors of the Civil War,
Federal and Confederate, 50 years after the Battle of Appomattox,
painted by Walter Beck; gift of the artist. Thirteen portraits
painted by eminent American artists and representing distinguished
leaders of American and allied nations in the war with Germany;
presented by the national art committee. Bust in bronze of Jeanne
d’Arc, by Madame Berthe Girardet; presented to the American
Nation by the artist, through Mrs. John Jacob Hoff, in these words:
“To the American people in memory of what our soldier boys have
done in France at a crucial time of need”; acceptance by the Smith-
sonian Institution was approved by the committee. Mantel of carved
white holly, with fireplace of pink Numidian marble, from the
recently demolished residence of the late Benjamin H. Warder, 1515
K Street NW., Washington, D. C., Henry Hobson Richardson, archi-
tect; gift of William W. W. Parker. Four paintings, The Storm,

trait of Henry Fuller, 1873, by George Fuller, were lent to the
Dallas Art Association, Dallas, Tex., for its fourth annual exhibi-
tion, held November 14-28, 1923. These works have been returned
to the gallery. The exhibition was international in character, and
a distinguished collection was secured for display.

The Happy Mother, by Max Bohm, was exhibited at the Art
Center, Washington, D. C., on the occasion of a memorial meeting
to the artist, October 20-21, 1923. Mr. Bohm died on September 23,
1923, at Provincetown, Mass.

Art Gallery, Memphis, Tenn., for exhibition there during the Con-
federate reunion in June, 1924. They have been returned to their
places in the gallery.

Two paintings by J. Alden Weir—Upland Pasture and The Gen-
tlewoman—were lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art for a
memorial exhibition of the work of that artist held in the Gallery of
Special Exhibitions from March 17 to April 20, 1924. These paint-
ings have been returned to the gallery.

Three paintings—Birch-clad Hills by Ben Foster, A Family of
Birches by Willard L. Metcalf, and The Island by Edward W. Red-
field—were lent to the American Federation of Arts, which assem-
bled and sent, through the cooperation of the Department of State
and the United States Shipping Board, an exhibition of paintings
by American artists to be shown at the great international exhibi-
tion in Venice during this spring and summer, 1924.

Thirty paintings by contemporary American artists, largely from
the William T. Evans collection, were lent to the American Federa-
tion of Arts for its traveling exhibition during the season of 1923-
24. These paintings were shipped to the Michigan Art Institute at
Detroit for its exhibit of August 31 to September 8, 1923, and have
since been shown at Nashville, Tenn., Kansas City, Mo., Peoria, IL,
Memphis, Tenn., Lincoln, Nebr., Clay Center, Kans., and New
Orleans, La. They have been returned to the gallery.

The painting by John La Farge, entitled “The Visit of Nico-
demus to Christ,” was lent to the American Federation of Arts for
exhibition at the Carnegie Public Library, Fort Worth, Tex. Since
returned to the gallery.

SPECIAL EXHIBITIONS HELD IN THE GALLERY

A collection of nine paintings by the Tuscan artists Francesco
Gioli (1846-1922) and Luigi Gioli, lent by the Royal Embassy of
Italy, Washington, D. C., was shown on screens in the totem-pole
room at the south end of the gallery.

A special joint exhibition of paintings by Savely Sorin and
sculptures of Seraphin Soudbinine was held in the large central room
of the gallery. The opening view, cards for which were issued by
the Smithsonian Institution, took place on the afternoon of Janu-
ary 10, from 2 to 4.30. The exhibition closed on January 27, 1924.

An exhibit of the art work of Viennese children, pupils of Pro-
fessor Cizek, of Vienna, was held in the lobby of the Natural
History Building, under the auspices of the American Federation
of Arts, May 7 to 19, 1924. This exhibit is being circulated in this
country under the auspices of the Rockefeller Foundation.

INSTALLATION OF THE WORLD WAR PORTRAITS
e

In the annual report for 1923 a brief account was given of the
painting and subsequent history of the World War portrait collec-
tion provided by the National Art Committee, and it may be desir-
able here to repeat the statement there made to the effect that the
original plan for the acquirement of the collection for the Nation
has not as yet been fully carried out. Im order that the gift of
these portraits might have a distinctly national character, it was
planned that a group of two or more, financed by citizens of any
city, should be inscribed as presented by that city. Thirteen of the
portraits were in this manner added to the national collection, while
eight await the reawakening of the patriotic impulse that inspired
the original movement in behalf of a World War collection.

In 1921 the collection was turned over to the American Federa-
tion of Arts by the committee for exhibition purposes, and was
shown in 25 of the principal American cities. On arrival in Wash-
ington, June 12, 1923, the portraits, 20 in number, and 1 portrait
group, supplemented later by a portrait of the Queen of the Bel-
56 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

gians, were installed in the foyer of the New National Museum, in
direct association with the great collection of World War historical
exhibits. This proved unsatisfactory, however, and space was
finally provided on the second floor of the Natural History Museum,
where partitions were erected inclosing a floor space 34 by 37 feet.
This improvised gallery, artificially lighted, although separated
from the gallery proper, proved to be quite satisfactory, and the por-
traits are shown to good advantage.

DISTRIBUTIONS

Loans have been withdrawn by their owners as follows:

Evening; Junipers in Winter, by Ludwig Dill; withdrawn by the
American Federation of Arts.

Portrait of Associate Justice Pierce Butler, of the United States
Supreme Court, by Nicholas Richard Brewer; withdrawn by Mr.
Butler.

Forty-one paintings by Ossip Perelma; withdrawn by Mr.
Perelma.

Portrait of San Lorenzo Guistiniano, by Gentili Bellini; with-
drawn by the American Red Cross through Miss Irene M. Given-
wilson, curator of the Red Cross Museum.

Painting entitled “A Prayer to St. Genevieve,” by Mme. la Mar-
quise de Wentworth; withdrawn by Dr. J. H. Gore.

NECROLOGY

The announcement of the death of Ralph Cross Johnson on July
9, 1923, at his summer home, city of Belfast, Me., where he and Mrs.
Teer had settled for the summer, came as a great surprise and
is deeply regretted by the Smithsonian people, and very especially
by the staff of the National Gallery. Mr. Johnson’s gift to the gal-
lery of masterpieces of painting is regarded as one of the richest con-
tributions ever made to the art treasures of the Nation.

The Rev. Alfred Duane Pell, D. D., of New York City, a bene-
factor of the gallery, died in April, 1924.

Appended to this report is a list of portraits and portrait sculp-
ture, approximately 450 in number, belonging to the Smithsonian
Institution and its branches (not printed). It is intended to serve
as a record of the Institution’s collections in these branches and for
convenience in organizing the contemplated national portrait gal-
lery.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 3
REPORT ON THE FREER GALLERY OF ART

Str: I have the honor to submit the fourth annual] report on the
Freer Gallery of Art for the year ending June 30, 1924.

THE COLLECTION

Work completed during the year includes the examination, classi-
fication, and cataloguing of Chinese and Japanese stone sculptures
and paintings. Further work has been done in the preservation of
oil paintings; 40 Whistler water colors and pastels have been re-
framed, and the titles of those on exhibition have been painted upon
the frames. The relettering of titles and references upon the mounts
of Whistler etchings and lithographs is well advanced and the work
of remounting a certain number has been begun.

Identification photographs of all objects in the collections of pot-
tery, stone sculpture, jade, and bronze, and of a number of Chinese
paintings in panel form have been made. These photographs are
mounted upon the cards of the general catalogue and provide an
easy but accurate means of reference which saves much handling of
the collections. In response to requests other photographs and slides
have been made, reproducing not only objects in the collection, but
also cases and other details of installation, as well as views in and
about the building.

During January and February a special exhibition of 136 Whistler
etchings, dry points, and lithographs was on view in Galleries I, IT,
III, and IV. In May the Chinese makimono, shown in Gallery XIV,
were installed in cases built to receive them. Other changes in ex-
hibition involved 42 oil paintings, 14 water colors, 20 pastels, 5
Indian paintings, 3 Persian paintings, 2 Chinese paintings, 2 Chinese
bronzes, 2 Chinese sculptures, 1 piece of Korean pottery, 1 Japanese
painting.

One thousand four hundred gallery books, giving detailed infor-
mation about objects on exhibition, have been compiled, mimeo-
graphed, and bound for use in all the Whistler galleries, including
the Peacock Room. Through the courtesy of the Boston Museum of
Fine Arts, the Synopsis of History, a parallel chronological table
prepared for the use of students, has been issued in a Freer Gallery
edition, which has had a second printing of 500 copies, while our

57
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

pamphlet giving general information about the gallery and collec-
tions has reached a third printing of 3,000 copies. One thousand
four hundred and eighty-two copies of the foregoing publications
have been sold at the north entrance and on order.

Additions to the collections by purchase are as follows:

BRONZE, CHINESE

23.1. Ceremonial vessel of the type chia. Chou dynasty, 1122 to 255 B. C.
23.2. Toilet box of the type lien. Six Dynasties, sixth century (?).

T’ang dynasty, eighth-ninth century.

Additions to the library, by gift and purchase, comprise 7 maps,
134 pamphlets, and 145 books and periodicals in various Asiatic and
European languages. A list of these additions accompanies this re-
port. (Appendix A, not printed.) The necesary work of examin-
ing the Chinese texts for omissions and duplications due to faulty
printing and binding has been begun and is still under way. Sev-
enty-four volumes of European books have been rebound.

BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT

The workshop has built during the year, one 15-foot case, three
12-foot cases, and two 9-foot cases, with easels to be placed in them;
also, four 70-inch cases, two small square cases, and six stands for
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 59

objects shown in cases. Six new wooden frames for cases were made
and the glass tops for these assembled. For this work a table and
rack with a metal pan was built. Two new pedestals for stone
sculptures were built and the sculptures mounted. The shop has
made also 40 butternut picture frames, which were sent away to be
gilded, 58 reeded French walnut frames, 24 frames for gallery and
other signs, and one large American walnut frame for hanging a
six-fold screen. In the autumn a removable vestibule door for
winter use was built and installed at the north entrance. In con-
nection with the use of the auditorium, the shop built a portable
wooden platform to be placed at times on the concrete stage, and
fitted up closet No. 10 as a cloak room, made a stand and lockable
cover for the projection lantern, built a portable barricade, and
rehung the door leading from the auditorium to the emergency exit.
Locks were placed on all storage cases in storage rooms 3 and 4, and
numerous fittings, such as bronze clamps for makimono on exhibi-
tion, a map drawer in the curator’s office, a device for hanging
kakemono for examination, stands with frames for notices, etc., were
made.

A portable scaffold was built for use in the court in cleaning win-
dows; the joints of the coping of the main walls and court walls
were covered with felt and cement; a picture molding was put on the
west wall of study room No. 1; one section of a new device for modi-
fying the light has been made and installed in the attic; and mis-
cellaneous repairs have been made on objects in the collection and
on furniture and building. .

The shop has also recolored the east wall of Gallery XVI, painted
the floor of study room No. 2, painted numbers in the various sec-
tions of attic and sub-basement in accordance with the architect’s
plan, painted the underside of the skylight glass, and lettered and
painted several signboards. In the summer of 1923 the lettering for
the inscriptions to be placed on the outside of the building was done
by the shop painter after the architect’s design, and later the in-
scriptions were cut by outside contract. By outside contract, also,
weatherproof shades were put outside the north and south corridor
windows.

To the general equipment have been added during the year a mim-
eograph, a stereopticon lantern, and several pieces of office furniture.

The Freer Gallery is gratefully indebted to the Bureau of Fisheries
for the gift of goldfish for the fountain, to the Zoological Park for
the loan of three peafowl, and to the Department of Agriculture for
advice as to the care of the box trees and rhododendrons in the court
and for constant oversight of them.
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924
ATTENDANCE

The gallery has been open every day, with the exception of Mon-
day, from 9 o’clock until 4.30, and with the exception, also, of four
days when it was closed by Executive order at the time of the death
of President Harding. The total attendance for the year was 111,942.
The aggregate Sunday attendance was 28,925, making an average
of 546; the week-day attendance amounted to 83,017, with an aver-
age of 824. Of these visitors, 482 came to work in the study rooms
or to examine objects not on exhibition; 70 to make a study of the
building, storage facilities, lighting, wall-coloring, etc.; 10 to make
copies or studies from objects in the collection, and 35 brought
objects in their possession for examination and information.

On February 7, 8, and 9 the auditorium of the Freer Gallery was
placed at the disposal of the Library of Congress for the presenta-
tion of three recitals of chamber music. These concerts were the
gift to the Library of Mrs. Frederic Shurtleff Coolidge, to accom-
pany her gifts of the manuscripts of 13 modern compositions to the
music division. Seven of these were performed.

On April 29 Professor Paul Pelliot, of the Collége de France, gave
an illustrated lecture on “ Chinese bronzes, jades, and sculptures.”
The total attendance at the concerts was 1,080, and at the lecture
202, making a grand total attendance for the gallery of 113,224.

PERSONNEL

Miss Grace L. McKenney entered as an assistant on October 22.
1923.

Miss Mildren M. Tytus worked as an assistant from November
12 to May 17.

Mrs. Rita W. Edwards was transferred from the office of corre-
spondence and documents on February 16, and was regularly ap-
pointed to the position of stenographer on April 1.

Miss Chie Hirano, librarian of the department of Chinese and
Japanese art of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, and Mr. K. S.
Wang, have worked on the cataloguing of Japanese and Chinese
books.

FIELD WORK

Since the activities of the expedition sent to China under the
joint auspices of this gallery and the Museum of Fine Arts, Bos-
ton, have been conveyed to you in detail from time to time through
the reports and correspondence of the field staff, I venture merely
to remind you now of the fruitful investigations carried on during
the year at Hsin-chéng Hsien in Honan; at I Chou in Chihli; at
the tombs of Han Wu Ti, Ho Chii-ping, and others in Shensi; and,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 61

latterly, at Yii-ho Chén in Honan, where some burials of the Han
dynasty have been thoroughly investigated with gratifying results.
But important as the archeological work of our expedition has been,
we are more to be congratulated, perhaps, on our success in estab-
lishing between ourselves and the Chinese authorities a cooperative
agreement with regard to archeological investigation which has
been confirmed by the unsolicited appointment of Mr. Bishop as
Honorary Adviser in Archeology to the Historical Department of
the Chinese Government. An arrangement of this sort was conceived
as the fundamental object of our expedition, and its accomplishment
marks the first definite effort of the kind to bring Chinese archeolo-
gists and officials together in a mutually beneficial and dignified
relationship with western archeologists and museums, thus pro-
viding in some measure, at least, a working basis on which a more
enlightened scholarship may flourish and gradually supplant, let
us hope, the ruthless and unscientific collecting of Chinese antiq-
uities on a commercial scale which has hitherto been allowed and
even encouraged to furnish so much of the material available for
students in this vast and increasingly important field.

Mr. Bishop’s detailed account of his field activities accompanies
this report as Appendix B (not printed).

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 4
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the re-
searches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1924. These
were conducted in accordance with the act of Congress approved
June 12, 1923, which contains the following item:

American ethnology: For continuing ethnological researches among the
American Indians and the natives of Hawaii, including the excavation and
preservation of archeologic remains, under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution, including the necessary employees and the purchase of necessary
books and periodicals, $44,000.

The Bureau of American Ethnology was founded by Maj. J. W.
Powell and placed under the direction of the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution by act of Congress. This bureau is de-
-voted to the increase of knowledge of the American Indian, as well
as of the natives of Hawaii and the aborigines of Porto Rico. It
follows the ideal of the Smithsonian Institution as applied to
researches on the American Indians, including all branches of their
archeology and ethnology. The bureau publishes annual reports and
bulletins, the whole number of these thus far published being 40
reports and 81 bulletins. The former assume the form of me-
moirs, often large and highly technical; the latter are generally
smaller in size, often preliminary in character.

The fundamental idea which led to this appropriation was the
recognized necessity for reliable information for a proper appre-
ciation of the Indian, as an aid to legislation. Very extravagant
and diametrically opposite opinions were rife regarding the char-
acter of our aborigines. In the early days of contact of the Euro-
pean and Indian races erroneous romantic ideas were largely
prevalent, but with the application of the science of anthropology
new values of Indian character developed. The Indian in some
quarters was regarded solely as an object of research; the humani-
tarian side was lost sight of, and the fact that he is a man belonging
to one of the most important races in the ultimate amalgamation of
the different peoples was overlooked. The aim of the Bureau of
American Ethnology is to discover and to disseminate correct ideas
of the Indian as a race, that our people may better understand and

62
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 63

appreciate his history, language, sociology, music, religion, and
various arts and industries. It is obligatory for the bureau to pre-
serve accurate records of customs indigenous to America that are
rapidly being lost in the settlement of the former homes of the
Indians by members of the white race. The value of this material
will increase in coming years, for the records that are now being
made are final and in many cases will be the sole objective informa-
tion that posterity will have of the Indian and his customs. This
work is imperative, for within the past few decades a great deal of
information of this kind has disappeared unrecorded, and the prob-
ability is that this generation will witness the death of most aborigi-
nal survivals in culture.

While the ideal of the bureau is the acquisition of knowledge and
the publication of the same through reports, there has grown up a
great deal of work on related subjects that absorbs more or less of
the time of the chief and his staff. Information is sought from all
quarters regarding the Indians, and urgent calls from State insti-
tutions and universities asking for advice and help in local prob-
lems have been more numerous than at any other time in the his-
tory of the institution. Routine office work has assumed in the past
ten years a larger relative proportion than in former decades. Va-
rious agencies have quickened interest in the problems considered
by the Bureau of American Ethnology. The great increase in travel
resulting from the development of the automobile and the founda-
tion of national parks has intensified the desire to “see America
first.’ Our parks and Indian reservations have been visited in the
past few years by an ever increasing number of travelers. This has
stimulated a demand on the part of the general public for accurate
information on the history and customs of the Indians, which the
bureau endeavors to supply.

Tt can not be expected, when the office work has grown to such mag-
nitude and the appropriations have remained practically the same
as they were before the war, that the quantity of research in the field
can equal that of former years, but the chief has endeavored to have
as many of the staff in the field as he can and to publish the reports
of their work as rapidly as feasible. It is self-evident that the
acquisition of knowledge regarding the Indians, even if not pub-
lished, is a most valuable asset, notwithstanding the fact that it must
be stored in the archives to await a more favorable time for pub-
lication.

The first duty of the chief being administrative and his time
for a large part of the year being occupied with routine matters,
he does not have much opportunity for field work, but notwithstand-
ing this fact scientific work of a limited nature has been done by him
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

in the field. He has kept en rapport with the work of all archeo-
logical expeditions in the Southwest in order to be able to advise
you in regard to your recommendations for archeological work on
the public domain. The number of expeditions in the Southwest
has tripled or quadrupled in the last decade.

The field work engaged in by the chief during the past year was
archeological in nature, in cooperation with Mr. E. M. Elliott and
his associates, of St. Petersburg, Fla. There are few areas in the
United States which promise more to the archeologist than south-
western Florida along the shore from Tampa Bay to Cape Sable.
Perhaps no one has added more to our knowledge of this area than
Mr. F. H. Cushing, a former ethnologist of the bureau. The prob-
lems of southern Florida demand more objective material than we
have from the Everglades and the Ten Thousand Islands, where
numerous proofs of a vanished population are in evidence in the
form of enormous shell heaps and earth mounds.

The chief began his researches on Weeden Island, near St. Peters-
burg, which is situated at the end of Gandy Bridge, an artificial
causeway crossing Tampa Bay. The evidences of prehistoric aborig-
inal life on Weeden Island are numerous large shell heaps and
sand heaps which may be divided into groups or types, as kitchen
middens, observatories, foundations of houses, and burial places.
Evidently there was formerly a large village near the highest point
of the island. One of the mounds which was chosen for excavation
turned out to be a cemetery, and in the course of the winter about
one-half of it was excavated. The work extended from November
until March, inclusive.

The chief was not able to be in St. Petersburg the whole winter,
but after having started the work in November, 1923, he returned
to Washington, assigning the direction of the excavations to Mr.
Stanley Hedberg and later to Mr. M. W. Stirling, of the National
Museum, who continued the work until the chief’s return in Feb-
ruary. Asa result of the excavation a large collection of aboriginal
objects was brought to the United States National Museum. This
collection contains many unique specimens and will later be perma-
nently installed in the Museum upon completion of a report on it.
No specimens had formerly been excavated at Weeden Island and the
unique results of this work are regarded as most important. <A pre-
liminary report has been published in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous
Collections, vol. 76, No. 13.

At the present time it is too early to draw final conclusions from
the above work, but it is intended to continue excavations in Florida
in the winter of 1924. Many of the specimens found were not very
different from those characteristic of the west coast of Florida, but
the number of objects is greater and their variations so extensive
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 65

that they are thought to indicate a high development of the abo-
riginal culture in southern Florida. Evidences of two distinct
cultures, one above the other, were determined from the excava:
tions in the Weeden mound. The lower contained crude pottery.
very few implements, mostly of shell, all having a considerable like:
ness to the so-called archaic Antillean culture of Cuba. The uppet
layer contained very fine specimens of decorated pottery in greaf
numbers, showing close relationship to the ceramics of Georgia
This indicates an extension southward or a drift of population.
possibly allied to the Muskhogean, into the peninsula. The rela-
tionship of the people of the lower layer was Antillean rather than
Muskhogean. The inhabitants of southern Florida, when the earliest
burials were made in the Weeden mound, probably belonged to an
unknown tribe. The artifacts in the upper layer may be remains
of the Caloosa tribe, which was found there when Tampa Bay was
visited by Ponce de Leon. The Indians that now inhabit the Ever-
glades—the Seminoles—are a late introduction into Florida and of
Creek descent. The numerous Florida shell heaps antedated their
advent by several centuries.

The chief has actively worked during the past year for the forma-
tion of a new national monument on the Little Colorado, near Flag-
staff, Ariz. This monument has been temporarily named the Wu-
paki National Monument and includes ruins at the Black Falls of
the Little Colorado, first described by him in 1900. It is to be
hoped that before another report this most interesting group of
stone buildings will be added to the other archeological monuments.
The ruins that comprise it have some of the best preserved walls
in the Southwest.

The impression exists in some quarters that the work of the
Bureau of American Ethnology must be completed in a certain
definite time. This impression has no real foundation, for ethnology
is like any other scientific study and has no limitations. Every new
year of work in the bureau enlarges the horizon of research and
presents new problems regarding the American Indians for sulution.
Since the foundation of the bureau by the late Maj. J. W. Powell
the aims and tendencies of the science of ethnology have greatly
enlarged, and the published studies of the staff have put the science
of anthropology upon such a firm foundation that not only the past
appropriations but also the prospective expenditures by Congress
are more than justified. The earlier work covered a limited scope;
it pointed out the field for future work. It now remains for the
comparative ethnologist to connect the various problems of mau
and his culture and to shed new light on what still remains unsolved.
By law the ethnological research of the staff of the bureau is limited
to the American Indians and the aborigines of Hawaii. The logical
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

outcome is the enlargement of the Bureau of American Ethnology
into a bureau devoted to the study of all races.

Even in studying the Indians there are great regions of South
America which are practically unknown to the ethnologist. South
America, next to Central America, contains examples of probably
the highest culture that has ever been attained by the American
race. I refer, of course, to the civilization of the great empire of
the Incas, extending from the Isthmus of Panama to southern Chile.
In this prolific field the bureau has done comparatively little, and
the time is now ripe for an extensive exploration in that field. No
less important in South America is the area inhabited by wild
tribes, such as the Matto Grosso and other regions east of the moun-
tains. The remarkable similarity of the culture of the Indians in
Argentina and that of the pueblos especially pleads for more thor-
ough investigation of the former area. The great valley of the
Amazon, that has attracted the ethnologist since the wonderful
voyage of Alex. Von Humboldt at the beginning of the last cen-
tury, still holds out new problems.

The bureau will soon issue a remarkably complete work by Dr.
Walter E. Roth on British Guiana, which probably will be one of
the finest it has ever published. It adds much to our knowledge, but
no more important fact than the magnitude of the numerous fields
remaining to be investigated in northern South America. The lan-
guages, sociology, religion, arts, history, and archeology of almost
every country in South America demand research. Here we have a
great continent awaiting the student of the antiquity and cultural
relationship of the American race.

In the same way the field of Central America and Mexico now
awaits the investigator, although in that particular area the bureau
has made some very important contributions.

There remain special problems of secondary nature throughout
the continent that are as yet unanswered which would be within the
scope of the bureau’s work. All ethnological work on the South
American Indians should have very great influence in uniting more
firmly the republics of Spanish origin and the United States.

Of the many problems awaiting investigation, one of the more
important is the plotting of the trails by which communication was
carried on between Indian tribes. These trails historically followed
by roads and railroads now serve the growing habit of the automo-
bile and the desire of Americans to see their own country. A study
of the foods used by the Indians has a practical value which can not
be overestimated. The number of plants used by the Indians far
outnumbers those on our own table, and the bureau might well give
attention to the discovery of new food resources.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 67

It is desirable to increase the archeological work of the bureau
which thus far has attracted a great deal of attention and which is
one of the foremost departments of anthropological study. This
study should be extended to Florida and the coast States with a
view to determining the relationship of the antiquities of North and
Central America. The investigation of the southwestern portion of
Texas and the adjoining State of New Mexico should be exploited,
especially the contents of the new national monument near Carlsbad
which contains important archeological material. One important
problem is to follow the extension northward of the Huaxtec culture
along the shores of Tamaulipas and Texas to our southern mound
builders.

During the fiscal year Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, com-
pleted the translations of stories from his Koasati, Alabama, Hit-
chiti, Natchez, and Creek texts, and added to them the stories ob-
tained only in English and those in the Tuggle collection; he pro-
vided these stories with footnotes referring to similar tales among
other tribes, and prepared an introduction for the whole. In addi-
tion to this work he has edited and largely recast a manuscript on
Indian trails by the late Mr. W. E. Myer. Also, with the assistance
of Miss Atkins, he has begun incorporating into an alphabetical
card index all words in the Timucua language contained in the re-
ligious works of the Franciscan missionaries Pareja and Movilla—
nearly all that is left to us of this old Florida tongue. Nearly one-
third of the work has been completed.

On the ist of July, 1923, Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist, was
on board the Sagona en route to Labrador. He reached the North-
west River on July 4, where he found a few Nascapi Indians, one
from Davis Inlet, besides the ordinary Montagnais Indians of the
vicinity. From his work among these Indians it follows that the
language of the Nascapi and Davis Inlet Indians is the same, and
that instead of being a wholly distinct language it is nothing but a
Montagnais dialect. Furthermore, it is abundantly clear that the
dialects of the above-named Indians form a distinct unit as compared
to the Montagnais dialects of Lake St. John and Lake Mistassini,
as well as the so-called “ Cree” of Rupert’s House and the East Main
River, which really are not Cree at all but Montagnais dialects.
The report of some Indians to the west of the Nascapi speaking a
language unintelligible to them is worth investigating at a later
date. It may be noted that the folklore of the Indians of Labrador
contains more elements occurring among Central Algonquians than
has been suspected. The very simple social organization of the
Labrador Indians makes it very probable that the rather complex
organizations of the Central Algonquians are unoriginal and are
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

due both directly and indirectly to the influence of non-Algonquian ”
tribes. He was able to measure only a few of the Indians at the
Northwest River, so it is not possible to state precisely which physi-
cal type they represent.

At the conclusion of his work he returned to Rigolet and left
on July 22 for St. Johns, Newfoundland. En route he was able to
take the measurements of a few Eskimos. On his arrival at St. Johns
he proceeded by steamer and train for Tama, Iowa, to renew his
researches among the Fox Indians. He devoted especial attention
to the ceremonial runners of these Indians, and in the course of
the winter submitted a manuscript on them for publication by the
bureau. Further, a number of Fox texts were translated and other
ethnological data obtained. Doctor Michelson returned to Washing-
ton near the close of September. He made another trip among the
Foxes in May and returned to Washington toward the end of June.
During this trip he obtained new data on Fox ceremonials.

By joint arrangement with the Museum of the American Indian,
Heye Foundation, the bureau undertook in the summer of 1923 the
excavation of the Burton Mound at Santa Barbara, Calif., which
was the chief village of the Santa Barbara Indians and without
question the most important archeological site on the southern Cali-
fornia coast. Mr. J. P. Harrington, ethnologist of the bureau, was
detailed to take charge of the exploration of the mound and the
work was commenced early in May, 1923, and continued throughout
the summer and fall. The first day’s work revealed the location of
the cemetery, just where old Indians had stated that it was situated.
During several months of careful stratigraphical excavation many
facts of interest for the prehistory of the Santa Barbara Indians
and the early culture of the Pacific coast in general were recorded.

The principal rancheria or village of the ancient Santa Barbara
Valley was not at the mission, where the Indians were later gathered,
but at the beach. It was situated just west of the mouth of Mis-
sion Creek, where a landing cove for canoes and two low mounds,
one by the beach and a larger one 650 feet inland and now known
as the Burton Mound, afforded unusual attraction as a dwelling
place for Indians. At a number of places in the locality were sul-
phur springs; also springs of good drinking water. The name of
the village was Syujtun, meaning “ where the trail splits.” There a
thriving population of some 500 Indians lived on the wild food
products of the neighboring shore and sea and of the Santa Barbara
Valley, rich in acorn-bearing oaks and game animals.

The inhabitants of Syujtun remained unmolested until the estab-
lishment of the Santa Barbara Mission in 1786. After this the native
villagers were gradually removed to the adobe cuarteles of the mis-
sion, 2 miles distant, and the desolated beach was known as “el
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 69

puerto de Santa Barbara” or as “el rancho de la playa.” After

the confiscation of the mission lands the ownership of the beach
ranch passed into private hands. During the forties the owner was
none other than Capt. George C. Nidever, known in California
history as the rescuer of the last surviving Indian woman from San
Nicolas Island. Captain Nidever sold the property in 1851 to
Augustus F. Hinchman, whose daughter, Miss Stella F. Hinchman,
has furnished valuable data about the history and traditions of the
mound. In 1860 Mr. Hinchman sold the tract in turn to Lewis T.
Burton, who made it his home for 19 years and after whom the
mound has been called in more recent times. None of the early
owners had allowed excavation on the property and with erection
of the Potter Hotel on top of the mound in 1901 all hope of
archeological investigation was lost. This hotel burned to the
ground on April 19, 1921, and the old village site was thereby again
released for archeological investigation.

The results of this excavation of the Indian town of Santa Bar-
bara proved rich and interesting beyond expectation. The graves
that were opened were crowded with human bodies, trinkets, and
a great variety of utensils. Among the rarest specimens are the
largest soapstone canoe ever discovered in California, a wooden awl
such as is described by the early historians, and a number of objects
of problematical use. There are soapstone pipes, fishhooks of
abalone and bone, sinker stones, arrowheads of great variety, spear-
heads, about 140 fine mortars, pestles, including some very long ones,
beads of many kinds, pendants, daggers, bowls and kettles of soap-
stone, including some of the largest ever found, native paints, etc.
About 300 skeletons were taken out, among them some very ancient
skeletons from the coquina or reef-rock layer. These are now in
the hands of Dr. Bruno Oetteking, of the Museum of the American
Indian, who is preparing an elaborate report on them.

At the close of January, Mr. Harrington returned to Washington
and has since then been engaged in the preparation of his report
on the Burton Mound.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, was engaged for the greater
part of the year in office work. This consisted chiefly in the his-
torical analysis of the large mass of material in native text
relating to the formation and structure and import of the League
er Confederation of the Five Iroquois Tribes or Nations. He was
also occupied in the translation of the farewell address of Degana-
wida, a founder of the confederation, into literary English. In
this address Deganawida briefly summarizes the scope and import
of the institutions and the laws of the league; herein, with the mas-
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

terful hand of a prophet-statesman, he also graphically recapitulated
the work accomplished by the several co-working founders.

Mr. Hewitt also translated from the Onondaga text the laws
first recognizing the extant institution of chieftainess in uterine
kindreds and then adopting it for the purpose of making it funda-
mental among the institutions of the League of the Iroquois, the laws
defining the duties, rights, and obligations of the incumbent of such
office and carefully prescribing the method by which a woman should
be nominated by the mothers of her own uterine kindred, the
method by which the choice should be confirmed, first by her own,
and then by sister, and then by cousin clans, and then finally how
this candidate should be installed at a federal council of condolence
and installation. These laws also prescribe the method by which
such chieftainess can, for cause, be deposed and a successor nomi-
nated and installed as prescribed by these laws; and they also pre-
scribe the method of nominating and installing the male aid to
the chieftainess, who must be a warrior and an orator to fulfill his
adjuvant duties.

As a member of the United States Geographic Board, representing
thereon the Bureau of American Ethnology, Smithsonian Insti-
tution, Mr. Hewitt has attended all regular and special meetings of
the board with a single exception. As custodian of manuscripts of
the Bureau of American Ethnology Mr. Hewitt reports that more
than 250 items were withdrawn and consulted by the various col-
laborators of the bureau and by other students.

In past years, in studying the social and political institutions of
the Iroquoian peoples, especially of the Five (latterly Six) Nations
or Tribes, Mr. Hewitt has spent a number of field seasons in carefully
collecting and recording in native texts from the best available
leaders, chieftains, chieftainesses, ritualists, and ceremonialists,
chiefly in the Mohawk, Onondaga, and Cayuga dialects, extensive
material and data concerning the principles, the laws, decrees and
ordinances of the instituting councils, the set rituals, the prescribed
chants, and the ceremonial addresses, which together defined the
functioning apparatus of the great commonwealth, commonly called
the League or Confederation of the Iroquois. Mr. Hewitt has under-
taken to subject, so far as possible, this text material to a careful
literary and historical] analysis and also to a thorough grammatic
and lexic criticism, in order to restore as far ‘as the evidence thus
secured will warrant, these rituals and chants and set addresses to
the earlier forms which were probably used when the League of the
Iroquois was instituted in the closing decades of the sixteenth cen-
tury. This work is necessarily tedious and slow but is of supreme
necessity. The results thus far are highly gratifying.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 71

In June, 1924, Mr. Hewitt visited the Six Nations of Iroquois
dwelling near Brantford, Ontario, Canada; the Onondaga dwelling
near Syracuse, N. Y.; the Tonawanda dwelling near Akron, N. Y.;
the Tuscarora dwelling near Sanborn, N. Y. His object on this trip
was to obtain a better knowledge of the music of the ritual chants
ot the Condolence and Installation Council. He also secured
quantity of purple wampum which is used in these league rituals
and which has now become so scarce that its cost is well-nigh pro-
hibitive.

Mr. Hewitt was also able to secure from the very few persons who
still retain some definite knowledge of the principles and _insti-
tutions of the league additional interpretative and confirmatory in-
formation concerning certain critical passages in the native texts
which he recorded in former field trips.

Mr. Francis La Flesche, ethnologist, gave most of his time to the
assembling of his notes on the child-naming rites and ceremonies
of the Osage Indians. These ancient rites, with their ceremonies, are
now practically obsolete, and it was fortunate that Mr. La Flesche
succeeded in securing two of the remaining versions. The first was
obtained from Wa-xthi’-zhi, a member of the I"-gtho”-ga or Puma
gens. This version will form the first part of the volume on this
subject.

The other version is that used by the Tsi’-zhu Wa-shta-ge, Peace-
maker, gens. It was with considerable difficulty obtained from old
Sho”’-ge-mo"-1", a member of the gens, who was very conservative
and opposed to having any of the tribal rites go to strangers. Since
the recording of these ancient rites that had been transmitted
through many generations, both these No*’-ho"-zhi"-ga, Wa-xthi’-zhi
and Sho”’-ge-mo?-i", have died, and it is now doubtful if any member
of the tribe could be found who is able to recite the rituals and go
through the ceremonial forms in their entirety.

Tsi’-zhu Wa-shta-ge version will form the second part of the
volume, now nearing completion, which is to be called “ Osage Child
Naming Rites.”

Mr. W. E. Myer, special archeologist, on his return from field work
in Tennessee, took up the preparation of his report on the remains
of the great prehistoric Indian settlement known as the Great Mound
Group in Cheatham County, Tenn., a preliminary account of which
was given in last year’s report. This town is situated on the Har-
peth River near Kingston Springs and is found in two clusters about
a mile apart in the bend of the Harpeth River, covering about 500
acres. The fortification of the Great Mound Group was one of the
finest prehistoric structures for defense made by the Indians of
Tennessee.
72 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Nearly all the lower river bend, called the “Mound Bottom” by
the local people, contains evidences of walls, many of which have
disappeared by long cultivation of the soil. Mr. Myer was not able
to determine the age of these mounds, but buildings which they
represent were undoubtedly destroyed before the coming of the
white people.

One of the most interesting results of the summer’s work was the
excavation of a small mound on the Denny farm at Goodlettsville,
Sumner County, Tenn., the relics from this mound showing that the
inhabitants of this site belonged to a culture quite unlike that of
much of the surrounding region in the valley of the Cumberland.

Mr. Myer also made studies in the southern part of Tennessee in
Lincoln and Moore Counties and made a map of a hitherto unde-
scribed mound group on Elk River.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

During the summer of 1923 Miss Frances Densmore visited the
Makah Indians at Neah Bay, Wash., and recorded their songs.
Neah Bay is near the end of Cape Flattery, but the coast is so
mountainous that it is reached only by boat. At the time of Miss
Densmore’s visit there was only one passenger boat a week to this
village. The principal industry of the Indians is salmon fishing.
The purpose of this trip was to observe the music of Indians who live
beside the ocean and to compare the music with that of tribes living
on the mountains, plains, and desert. As a result of the comparison
it was found that the music of the Makah resembles that of the Ute,
Papago, and Yuma more than it resembles that of the Chippewa,
Sioux, and Pawnee. This is general observation, the detailed com-
parison being unfinished. ‘Three instances are as follows: (1) The
Makah Indians use a “high drone,” or sustained tone held by two or
three women’s voices, while the others sing the melody. This was
heard among the Papago in southern Arizona and is found in certain
parts of Asia. This suggests a cultural evidence that the Indians
migrated from Asia and down the Pacific coast, the use of the drone
being more pronounced among the Makah than among the Papago;
(2) the Makah Indians have a considerable number of “ non-har-
monic ” songs to which the term “key ” can not properly be applied.
These were found in southern Arizona but not in the plains region ;
(3) the Makah songs concerning the whale are marked by a very
small compass and small intervals. The Ute songs concerning the
bear are also characterized by small intervals, but the compass is not
particularly small. The Makah songs recorded were of several
classes, including songs of the whale legends and whaling expedi-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 73

tions, songs of the potlatch and various social dances, songs con-
nected with contests of physical strength, “ gratitude songs,” which
were sung by individuals at feasts, lullabies for children, courting
songs, and the songs of wedding festivities.

Dances and gatherings of the tribe were attended ; numerous speci-
mens illustrating the culture of the people were collected ; the singers
and environment were photographed; and about 30 specimens of
plants were collected, with a description of their economic uses.

While in Washington, D. C., Miss Densmore arranged in a cata-
logue list 868 songs awaiting publication, and arranged in the
proper order for publication all her material on Pawnee, Papago,
Yuma, Cocopa, and Mohave music. Four manuscripts were sub-
mitted during the year, with the titles “Cocopa and Mohave Dance
Songs,” “Dance Songs and Flute Music of the Yuma,” “ Whaling
Songs, Dream Songs, and Legend Songs of the Makah,” and “ Pot-
latch Songs of the Makah.” These comprised, in addition to the
text, 87 songs, with phonograph records, musical transcriptions, and
analyses.

EDITORIAL WORK AND PUBLICATIONS

DISTRIBUTION OF PUBLICATIONS
The distribution of publications has been continued under the im-

mediate charge of Miss Helen Munroe, assisted by Miss Emma B.
Powers. Publications were distributed as follows:

As compared with the fiscal year ending June 30, 1923, there was
a decrease of 3,731 publications distributed, due to the fact that no
report volumes were issued during the year, whereas two reports
were published in the preceding fiscal year.

ILLUSTRATIONS

Mr. DeLancey Gill, illustrator, with the assistance of Mr. Albert
EK. Sweeney, continued the preparation of the illustrations of the
bureau. A summary of this work follows:

The work of reclassification of negatives has progressed satisfac-
torily. As a prelude to a new catalogue of the large collection of
negatives, this work will be of lasting value. About 4,000 negatives
were identified and rejacketed, but much yet remains to be done.

LIBRARY

The reference library continued under the immediate care of Miss
Ella Leary, librarian, assisted by Mr. Thomas Blackwell.

During the year 560 books were accessioned. Of these 82 were
acquired by purchase, 253 by gift and exchange, and 225 by binding
of periodicals. The current periodicals annually received number
about 975, of which 387 are by subscription, the remainder being
received through exchange. The library has also received 225 pam-
phlets. The aggregate number of books in the library at the close
of the year was 25,621, of pamphlets about 15,325.

During the year many students not connected with the Smith-
sonian Institution have applied to the library for books. The library
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 75

was used also by the Library of Congress and officers of the execu-
tive departments, and out of town students have made use of the
library through frequent loans.

Conditions of crowding on the book shelves are now acute in many
places in the stacks. Many volumes received by the library not per-
taining to anthropology were transferred to the library of the Smith-
sonian Institution.

COLLECTIONS

The following collections, purchased or acquired by members of
the bureau or by those detailed in connection with its researches,
have been transferred to the United States National Museum:

70367. Collection of about 90 specimens of picture pottery from the Mimbres
Valley, N. Mex.

APPENDIX 5
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES

Str: I have the honor to submit the report on the operations of the
International Exchange Service for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1924.

Congress appropriated $43,000 for the support of the service dur-
ing the year, $2,000 less than the previous appropriation. On the
basis of the previous year’s business this reduced amount would have
been sufficient for the needs of the service. Toward the middle of
the fiscal year, however, the exchanges had increased to such an
extent that it was necessary to send shipments to foreign countries
at less frequent intervals, in order to reduce the expense incurred
for freight, so as to avoid a deficit. Near the close of the year it was
found possible to return to the Institution’s practice of making ship-
ments to all foreign countries at intervals not exceeding a month.
In addition to the above amount, Congress appropriated for the ex-
changes $200 for printing and binding. The repayments from de-
-partmental and various other establishments aggregated $5,202.24,
making the total resources available for carrying on the system of
exchanges during the year $48,402.24.

The total number of packages passing through the service during
the year was 460,658, an increase over the number for the preceding
year of 82,832. The weight of these packages was 567,107 pounds,
an increase of 74,291. Much of this increase was due to the receipt
of a large number of publications from establishments in the United
States for transmission to the universities and colleges in Japan that
lost their libraries during the recent earthquake.

The publications sent and received by the Exchange Service are
classified under three heads: Parliamentary documents, depart-
mental documents, and miscellaneous scientific and literary publica-
tions. The term “parliamentary documents,” as here used, refers
to publications set aside by act of Congress for exchange with
foreign governments, and includes not only documents printed by
order of either House of Congress, but also copies of each publication
issued by any department, bureau, commission, or officer of the Gov-
ernment. Governments to which this class of publications are for-
warded send to this country in exchange copies of their own official

77
78

ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

documents for deposit in the Library of Congress. The term “ de-
partmental documents” embraces publications delivered at the In-
stitution by the various governmental departments, bureaus, or com-
missions for distribution to their correspondents abroad. Publica-
tions received in return are deposited in the various departmental
libraries. ‘Miscellaneous scientific and literary publications” are
received chiefly from learned societies, universities, colleges, scienti-
fic institutions, and museums in the United States for transmission
to similar establishments in all parts of the world.

The number and weight of the packages of different classes are
indicated in the following table:

As mentioned in previous reports, the disparity between the num-
ber of publications transmitted abroad and those received in return
is not as great as appears from the above figures. Packages sent
abroad contain in many instances only a single publication, while
those received in return often comprise several volumes. Further-
more, some foreign establishments send their publications directly
to their destinations in this country by mail instead of through
exchange channels.

During the year the State Department notified the Institution that
the Government of Hungary had adhered to the two exchange con-
ventions concluded at Brussels in 1886 and had established the
Hungarian Libraries Board at Budapest to carry out the provi-
sions of those conventions. The board was not fully established at
the close of the year, but will be ready to assume its duties as the
Hungarian Exchange Agency about October 1, 1924, when the
agency in Budapest conducted by the Institution for many years
will be discontinued. Dr. Julius Pikler, who has been the Smith-
sonian agent since July 1, 1906, has carried on the work to the entire
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 79

satisfaction of the Institution, and I desire to express here appre-
ciation of his faithful and efficient service during his connection with
this office.

The Institution was advised through diplomatic channels that the
Governments of the Dominican Republic, Hungary, Latvia, and the
Free City of Danzig had adhered to the two exchange conventions
concluded at Brussels March 15, 1886.

Toward the close of the fiscal year the librarian of the Storting
advised the Institution that the Norwegian depository of United
States official documents had been changed from the Stortingets
Bibliotek to the Universitets Bibliotek, Christiania.

The Japanese Association of the League of Nations submitted to
this country through the Embassy of Japan in Washington an ap-
peal for books for replenishing the libraries of Japanese universities
and colleges which were destroyed by the earthquake. The associa-
tion stated that that disaster wiped out huge collections of books
in many libraries, including the collection of 700,000 volumes in the
library of the Imperial University of Tokyo. The appeal was
heeded by many American establishments and thousands of publica-
tions were forwarded to the Smithsonian Institution for transmis-
sion to Japan through the International Exchange Service.

From time to time some of the establishments that make use of
the exchange service in the distribution of their publications abroad
add to their announcements a word of appreciation. During the
year a number of such gratifying expressions have been received,
particularly from the Argentine Republic, England, Germany, and
this country.

During the year 2,464 boxes were used in forwarding exchanges to
foreign agencies for distribution, being an increase of 241 over the
number for the preceding 12 months. Of the total number of boxes
sent abroad, 289 contained full sets of United States official docu-
ments for foreign depositories, and 2,175 included departmental
and other publications for depositories of partial sets and for other
correspondents. In addition to the packages sent abroad in boxes,
the exchange service mailed directly to their destinations during the
year about 40,000 packages. While it is the practice of the service to
send exchanges by freight to foreign agencies for distribution, quite
a number of packages are received for remote places which can not
well be reached through any of the agencies, and these packages are
forwarded by mail. Furthermore, owing to the high ocean freight
_ rates it often happens that it is cheaper to mail packages to some
countries than to pack them in boxes and ship them by freight.

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

In accordance with the terms of a convention concluded at Brus-
sels March 15, 1886, and under authority granted by Congress in
resolutions approved March 2, 1867, and March 2, 1901, 59 full sets
of United States official documents and 38 partial sets are now sent
through the Exchange Service regularly to depositories abroad. The
Ministry of Finance, Government of Northern Ireland, Belfast;
State Library, Reval, Esthonia; and the library of the League of
Nations, located at Geneva, Switzerland, have lately been added to
the list of those receiving full sets. The number of full and partial
sets of governmental documents forwarded to foreign depositories
is 97. The total number provided by law for this purpose and for
the Library of Congress is 100.

The convention concluded at Brussels in 1886 provided for the in-
ternational exchange of official documents and scientific and literary
publications. That convention was ratified by the United States,
Belgium, Brazil, Italy, Portugal, Serbia, Spain, and Switzerland.
Since the ratification of the Brussels convention a number of coun-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 81

tries have adhered thereto. The names of the countries, together
with the dates of their adherence, follow: Argentine Republic, 1889;
Paraguay, 1889; Uruguay, 1889 ; Poland,'1920; Czechoslovakia,’'1921 ;
Rumania, 1923; Dominican Republic, 1923; Hungary, 1923; and
Danzig, 1924.

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the oper-
ations of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1924:

The appropriation made by Congress for the regular maintenance
of the park was the same as for the preceding year, $125,000. The
bill providing for printing and binding, Smithsonian Institution,
contained an additional allotment of $300 for the National Zoologi-
cal Park.

The year has been one of the most successful in the history of the
park, both as to care and maintenance of the buildings, grounds,
and collections, and in service to the public. In addition to many
minor improvements, a new restaurant building has been completed.
This was in operation before the close of the year; and the cleanly,
roomy, open refreshment room and sanitary serving quarters have
been greatly appreciated by visitors. The collection is beyond doubt
of far greater value and scientific interest than ever before, and has
been kept in excellent condition, with low rate of loss. All previous
attendance records have been broken, and a total of 2,442,880 visitors
was recorded for the year.

ACCESSIONS

Gifts.—Altogether, 221 animals were presented to the park, or
placed on indefinite deposit, during the year. A most notable acces-
sion was a fine young Baird’s tapir, presented by Mr. M. G. Henery,
of Puerto Castillo, Honduras, and obtained through the interest of
Dr. Wm. M. Mann. Baird’s tapir has always been one of the rarest
animals in captivity and the only specimen ever before in the Na-
tional Zoological Park was a young animal exhibited for a short

time 24 years ago. Three species of tapirs are now living in the
_ park, a most unusual record for any zoological garden. Mr. Henery
is to be congratulated on his notable achievement in adding this
unusual animal to the national collections.

Mr. Victor J. Evans, of Washington, D. C., who has taken a great
interest in the National Zoological Park for many years, continued
his contributions of carefully selected animals of the rarer and more
87

88 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

unusual varieties. Among the specimens received from him during
the last year were such valuable species as the agile gibbon, gelada
baboon, Tasmanian devil, crimson-winged paroquet, Australian cat-
bird, and long-necked turtle. Altogether, Mr. Evans contributed 55
animals to the park during the year.

A most interesting collection from Brazil was brought to the park
by Dr. W. L. Schurz, commercial attaché, United States Embassy,
Rio de Janeiro. This collection included a fine South American bush
dog (Icticyon venaticus) , the first of its kind to be exhibited in the
park. There were also an ocelot, capybara, coatimundi, and several
birds. The bush dog is an exceedingly rare species in collections.

The Canadian Government, through Hon. J. B. Harkin, Commis-
sioner of Dominion Parks, presented a male yak and two female
Rocky Mountain sheep from Banff, Alberta; and the State Fish and
Game Commission of Utah, through Hon. D. H. Madsen, contributed
four beavers and a notable collection of wild ducks, including six
different species.

Births —During the year 42 mammals were born and 27 birds
were hatched in the park. These records, as in former reports, in-
clude only such as are reared to a reasonable age, no account being
made in these published statistics of young that live only a few days.
Mammals born include: Mexican puma, 2; lion, 2; dingo, 2; gray
wolf, 6; Rocky Mountain sheep, 1; mouflon, 1; aoudad, 1; tahr, 2;
American bison, 2; reindeer, 2; Japanese deer, 3; hog deer, 2; fallow
deer, 2; red deer, 5; guanaco, 1; Trinidad agouti, 3; rhesus monkey,
1; Javan macaque, 1; red kangaroo, 1; rufous-bellied wallaby, 1;
brush-tailed rock wallaby, 1. Birds hatched were of the following
species: Blue goose, black duck, wood duck, Australian ibis, black-
crowned night heron, and grass paroquet.

Twin monkeys were born for the first time in the records of the
park, but one of the young lived only a few days. The species was
Macaca rhesus. The breeding of the blue goose (Chen cerulescens)
is a notable achievement, of which the keepers in the bird division
may well be proud. The young of this bird have never before been
reared, and only once before, so far as is known, has the species
nested in captivity.

Eachanges.—A number of desirable animals were received in ex-
change for surplus stock. These included 12 mammals, 60 birds,
and 4 reptiles. Among the especially noteworthy accessions in this
class are a young black rhinoceros and a leopard from Africa, 5
reindeer from Norway, and 2 San Geronimo harbor seals from
Lower California. Birds received in exchange include a kiwi (Ap-
teryx mantelli), which, with a number of other rare species, came
from the Wellington, New Zealand, Zoological Gardens in exchange
for some American animals. There were also received in exchange
a trumpeter swan, a wedge-tailed eagle, and numbers of other water-
fowl and cage birds.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 91

Purchases.—Only 9 mammals, 81 birds, and 8 reptiles were pur-
chased during the year. Special mention should be made, however,
of a pair of Alpine ibex, from Europe, 10 Marquesas Islands doves,
2 bleeding-heart doves, 12 white-cheeked geese, 2 pink-footed geese,
2 Massena quail, and a gannet. All of these unusual species are
doing well in the park. ‘

Transfers.—The Biological Survey, United States Department of
Agriculture, transferred to the National Zoological Park a number
of especially desirable animals taken by field agents of the bureau or
seized by United States game wardens in discharge of their duties.
Of particular interest during the year were a black bear from Oregon,
2 pacas from Central America, a black-footed ferret from Nebraska,
2 white-cheeked geese from Alaska, 2 whistling and 2 mute swans.
Altogether, the Biological Survey contributed 7 mammals and 11
birds during the year.

Deposits—Among the few animals received on deposit are two
parrots rarely shown in this country. These are the Philippine
cockatoo and the Philippine green parrot, both new to the records

of the park.

REMOVALS

There were sent away in exchange to other zoological gardens
during the year, 75 surplus animals, including 41 mammals, 31
birds, and 3 reptiles. Among these were the following mammals
born and reared in the park: European brown bear, 3; raccoon, 4;
llama, 1; tahr, 1; yak, 2; Japanese deer, 9; red kangaroo, 1; rufous-
bellied wallaby, 3. In addition to these, 26 gray squirrels were sent
to Quantico, Va., for stocking the United States Marine Corps reser-
vation at that place, and 21 squirrels were sent to the military reser-
vation at Fort Hayes, Columbus, Ohio.

A number of animals on deposit were returned to owners.

Although the death rate has been held at a normally low mark,
there have been, as in all years, a few serious losses of animals.
Some records of interest because of the long periods of life in the
park are as follows: A sacred ibis (Threskiornis wthiopicus) re-
ceived September 25, 1903, died October 20, 1928, after 20 years and
25 days in the collection. An East African leopard, female, which
was presented to the park by Mr. W. N. McMillan, and arrived in
Washington December 19, 1909, died 14 years and 4 days later on
December 23, 1923. A boatbill heron (Cochlearius cochlearius) re-
ceived September 28, 1910, died on December 11, 1923, after 138
years 2 months and 13 days in the park. A female Mexican agouti
(Dasyprocta mexicana) received July 7, 1910, died August 28, 1923,
having lived in the park for 13 years 1 month and 21 days. A
female American elk (Cervus canadensis) born in the park on June
5, 1910, died August 10, 1923, at an age of 13 years 2 months and 5
days. A northern wild cat (Lynw vinta), male, received January 15,
1912, died 11 years 9 months and 18 days later, on October 28, 192s.
A male white stork (Ciconia ciconia) received August 12, 1912, died
April 26, 1924, after 11 years 8 months and 5 days in the park.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 93

A femafe tayra (Z'ayra barbara) received September 8, 1914, died
on March 20, 1924, from pericarditis, after a life of 9 years 6 months
and 12 days in the collection.

Other serious losses by death during the year were a Malay sun
bear, congestion of lungs, August 12, 1923; agile gibbon, pneumonia,
January 11, 1924; orang-utan, late rickets, February 15, 1924; and a
South American tapir, intussusception of small intestine, February
19, 1924.

Post-mortem examinations were made in most cases by the patho-
logical division of the Bureau of Animal Industry; but five examina-
tions were made by Dr. Adolph H. Schultz, of the Carnegie Institu-
tion, Laboratory of Embryology; and one was made at St. Eliza-
beths Hospital, Department of the Interior.

The following list shows the results of autopsies, the cases being
arranged by groups:

VISITORS

Attendance records exceeded the previous year (1923) by 49,452
and were 42,043 over the record year for the park (1921). ‘The
total number of visitors, as determined by count and estimate, was
2,449,880. This makes the fifth year in succession that the attend-
ance has exceeded two millions. The greatest attendance in any one
month was 352,425 in September, 1923.

IMPROVEMENTS

Work on the new paddocks for hoofed animals near the Connecti-
cut Avenue entrance, described fully in the last report, was finished
early in the year, and the 11 yards thus provided were all occupied
by animals in the fail. The superior arrangement of these paddocks
for the care and exhibition of the animals has been very favorably
commented upon by officials from other zoological gardens, and the
pleasing sight of herds of animals in such large inclosures is greatly
admired by visitors.

In late winter the birds were all removed from the North Ameri-
can waterfowl! lake and early in the spring the lake was thoroughly
cleaned of silt. The work was completed so that the waterfowl were
returned before the season for nesting. The sewer from the office
and stables was extended to connect with the Rock Creek intercept-
ing sewer. A new sidewalk on the east side of the road opposite
the restaurant building was completed, and roads, walks, and bridle
paths throughout the park were repaired. Two old boilers in the
central heating plant were replaced with new boilers of improved
pattern, thus considerably increasing the heating capacity of the
plant.

The usual repairs to roofs, gutters and downspouts, fences, and
cages were made and much of the ironwork was painted. The old
metal awning frames over the walk around the bear cages were
removed, since these unsightly frames were no longer needed, the
trees now providing ample shade. Work was begun on the ware-
house for new or surplus animals, approved in the last plan of opera-
tions. This long-needed structure will be completed in the present
year.

The most important improvement of the year has been the com-
plete reconstruction of the central refreshment building. The old
restaurant was found to be in such bad condition that very little of
the material in it could be used, and in order to provide the new
structure with suitable foundations it was almost entirely wrecked.
The new restaurant is built chiefly of chestnut timbers salvaged
102 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

from the dead trees in the reservation, and adds greatly to the ap-
pearance of the park. It was leased to a competent restaurant man,
who opened it to the public in April.

IMPORTANT NEEDS

Exhibition building for birds—The outstanding need of the: park
is a new building for exhibition of birds. As pointed out in previous
reports, the old bird house was built as a temporary structure many
years ago, and is now not only in bad condition and virtually beyond
repair but is so small that only a part of the valuable collection of
birds can be exhibited at one time. The public space is, furthermore,
entirely too restricted for present-day crowds of visitors. The col-
lection of birds is growing in importance and value year by year,
as rare and unusual specimens from all parts of the world are pre-
sented to the Government zoological gardens. Public interest in the
bird collection is very great, as attested by the throngs of visitors
that fill the old bird house, and it is greatly to be hoped that a new
building may soon be provided for the proper care and exhibition
of the birds and for the accommodation of the constantly increasing _
number of visitors who wish to see them to advantage.

Funds for purchase of animals—Although the National Zoo-
logical Park receives numerous animals each year as gifts or in
exchange for surplus stock reared in the park, sufficient funds
have never been available for the purchase of rare and unusual
species offered for sale from time to time. A representative or
well-balanced collection of the living animals of the world can be
built up and maintained only by the purchase of certain types of
animals not otherwise obtainable, and opportunities to secure these
desiderata must be taken up promptly if the animals are to be
obtained. Animals greatly needed to fill definite gaps in the col-
lection are offered for sale from time to time, but the park is most
often unable to purchase them for lack of funds. In addition to
increased appropriations to cover cost and transportation of ani-
mals, it is suggested that a fund, to be deposited with the Smith-
sonian Institution and held for the purchase of animals for the
National Zoological Park, be inaugurated. This fund might be
increased by gift or bequest, and could be regularly maintained by
an act of Congress authorizing deposit in it of certain miscellaneous
revenues of the park now turned into the general fund of the
Treasury, these including rent of refreshment stands, restaurant,
and other similar concessions.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 7

REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Sm: The Astrophysical Observatory was conducted under the fol-
lowing passage of the independent offices appropriation act approved
February 138, 1923:

Astrophysical Observatory: For maintenance of the Astrophysical Observa-
tory, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including assistants,
purchase of necessary books and periodicals, apparatus, making necessary
observations in high altitudes, repairs and alterations of buildings, and miscel-
laneous expenses, $15,500.

The observatory occupies a number of frame structures within an
inclosure of about 16,000 square feet south of the Smithsonian ad-
ministration building at Washington, and also a cement observing
station and frame cottage for observers on a plot of 10,000 square
feet leased from the Carnegie Solar Observatory on Mount Wilson,
Calif. :

A new solar observing station on Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., was
erected in July, 1920, at the expense of funds donated for the pur-
pose by Mr. John A. Roebling, of Bernardsville, N. J., and this sta-
tion has been occupied as a solar radiation observing station by the
Astrophysical Observatory since October, 1920.

The present value of the buildings and equipment for the Astro-
physical Observatory owned by the Government is estimated at
$50,000. This estimate contemplates the cost required to replace the
outiit for the purposes of the investigation.

WORK OF THE YEAR

There have been several features of particular interest, including
the installation of daily telegraphic reports from the Arizona and
Chile solar-radiation stations, certain experimental forecasts based
on these reports, and the measurement of the energy distribution in
the spectra of 10 of the brighter stars.

Work at Washington.—As in previous years, the variation of the
sun has been the main concern. The generosity of Mr. John A.
Roebling enabled arrangements to be made for daily telegrams from
our two solar radiation stations. This service was begun September
13, 1923. The results obtained in Chile are cabled in code, so that the
weighted mean solar-constant value, the date and hour of observa-

° 103
104 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

tion, and its grade are all included in two words. Messages arrive
at Washington from both stations within 24 hours of the actual
measurements, and generally represent mean results of five inde-
pendent determinations at each station. Arrangements have been
made (also owing to Mr. Roebling’s interest and generosity) to test
the value of the solar measurements for forecasting according to the
methods of Mr. H. H. Clayton. For this purpose Mr. Clayton has
had a small office and one assistant near his home in Canton, Mass.,
where he receives before noon daily from the Smithsonian Institu-
tion the weighted mean of the solar-constant values observed in
Arizona and Chile on the preceding day. He makes his forecasts for
3, 4, 5, and 27 days in advance, and mails them to the Institution on
the same afternoon. Thus we receive the forecasts sufficiently long
before their maturity to make a very real and searching test of their
validity.

These forecasts for definite days relate to the mean temperature of
New York City, and are later on compared with the observed tem-
peratures and analyzed by several purely mathematical methods
quite independently of any bias of the computer. The official
weather services of the various countries do not, of course, make
predictions parallel to these, except in Argentina, where such fore-
casts are made by similar methods to Clayton’s. Hence it is impos-
sible to know at present how much gain, if any, Mr. Clayton’s solar
forecasts show over the present official methods. That they do show
some prevision of the event, even to five days after the solar observa-
tions, is certain.

Hitherto, however, the 27-day detailed forecasts have shown no
correlation with the New York temperatures. This is not at all
surprising. Indeed, all such forecasts have to contend against great
odds. For we recall that the march of temperature often goes
quickly from crest to trough, so that even if a true forecast could
be made, and it should be no more than 12 or 24 hours off in point of
time, there would be large divergences between the prediction and
the event. With the unyielding mathematical methods of verifica-
tion this would greatly diminish the correlation found.

A fairer test for very long-range forecasts is found in general
statements as to the expected departure from mean normal tem-
peratures for coming months. These Mr. Clayton has furnished
from 15 to 30 days before the beginning of each month from De-
cember, 1923, to the present time. He also furnishes similar pre-
dictions about the approaching weeks furnished three days before
the beginning of the week in question. With few exceptions, these
broader prognostications have been fairly verified.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 105

On the whole, therefore, although the results are as yet far from
being entirely satisfying, these experimental forecasts of Mr. Clay-
ton’s are promising enough to warrant further trial. New methods
are continually being devised and tried in making them. Mr. Roe-
bling has generously arranged to continue them until June 30, 1925.
As the work is purely experimental no detailed publication of it will
be made at present.

Naturally, if the forecasts made by Mr. Clayton really represent
solar changes, he can not succeed unless good solar measurements
are supplied. As soon as we began to receive daily telegrams from
both stations occasional fairly wide disagreements of individual days
commanded attention. We felt it necessary, in studying the causes
of such disagreements, to revise again entirely the systems of little
corrections to solar-constant values which have to be made to allow
for the haziness and humidity of our atmosphere. This revision
could be made with more advantage because much additional data
had meanwhile accumulated.

Mr. Fowle and Mrs. Bond have worked over this matter during
practically their entire time, which, however, owing to furlough,
was only about three months in Mrs. Bond’s case. A new method of
determining these corrections has been devised by the director and
Mr. Fowle, which eliminates satisfactorily the influence of the solar
changes which have occurred. Hitherto this matter of solar change
superposed upon the small terrestrial sources of error which we de-
sire to eliminate has been very embarrassing. Of course, if one
could wait many years before proceeding to evaluate the terrestrial
effects, the solar changes, being independent or but loosely connected
with local terrestrial ones, would be eliminated in the mean of a mass
of observations. We can, indeed, after several years more of observ-
ing, finally proceed in this way. But wishing to make immediate
use of our results a new method of procedure has fortunately oc-
curred to us which permits us to avoid the interference of solar
changes altogether. The details will-be published soon.

As both to us and to the Chief of the Weather Bureau it seemed
unwise to publish preliminary values of the solar constant which
later on would have to be corrected, we have discontinued the fre-
quent publications of them in the Monthly Weather Review which
we have been accustomed to make for several years past. After we
come to a fully satisfactory basis of systematic atmospheric correc-
tions, these publications may be resumed.

Of the two solar-radiation stations, Montezuma, Chile, has proved
far more suitable to the purpose than Harqua Hala, Ariz. It seems
probable that a place somewhat farther west and decidedly higher
would be preferable to Mount Harqua Hala. Violent storms occur
there in various months of the year, and the summer months in par.
106 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

ticular have proved very unsatisfactory. If financial means were
available it would be highly desirable to remove the station to
another site, and, indeed, a better one is already selected which
would present many advantages. The cost of removal would be
about $7,000.

The systematic revision of results in the hands of Mr. Fowle and
Mrs. Bond has led to much improvement, as shown by the close
accord of daily solar-constant values at the two stations. For the
period September, 1922, to March, 1924, the average daily difference
is less than 0.5 per cent. In the month of October, 1923, when the
weather was fine at both stations almost every day, it ran as low as
0.2 per cent.

The solar-constant values have continued almost without excep-
tion below normal. From March, 1922, until June, 1924, the mean
result for every single month was below the normal value, which is
1.938 calories per square centimeter per minute. This long-continucd
defect of solar radiation may well have produced interesting climatic
effects. It is interesting to report in this connection a letter from
M. Antoniadi, of France, stating that the polar cap of Mars is larger
than it has been under parallel conditions for 70 years, and asking if
the solar-radiation measurements showed anything unusual. Nat-
urally decreased solar radiation would tend to produce that effect.

A letter from the eminent meteorologist, Doctor Bjerknes, of
Norway, to Doctor Hale, of the Mount Wilson Observatory, hus
been referred to us, and with permission of the author is here copied
in part as an indication of expert appreciation of our work:

’ I have been greatly interested in the establishment of a complete “ cir-
cumpolar ” weather service, as this only will give the full view of the changing
states of the atmosphere. This circumpolar service is now beginning to become
a reality. The charts may soon more or less cover the entire northern
hemisphere.

But then another idea arises by itself, namely, to bring these more and more
complete pictures of the varying states of our atmosphere into connection with
their ultimate cause, the solar activity, 211th

I am aware that the solar constant is determined every day at Mount Wilson
Solar Observatory, and at the Calama Observatory of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution. * * * JI think it would now be of high importance to every day
have the most recent value of the solar constant incorporated in the daily
meteorological issue.

If this should be practicable, the value of the data which are every day at
the disposal of the meteorologist would increase enormously. It is, of course,
dangerous to prophesy. But a new era may perhaps begin for meteorology
from the moment when the meteorologist has at his disposal every day com-
plete data both for the sun’s activity and for the state of the atmosphere over
an entire hemisphere of the earth.

Work at the two solar-radiation stations—The results just dis-
cussed are, of course, the fruit of the zealous work of our observers in

Arizona and Chile. Mount Harqua Hala continues under the direc-
tion of Mr. A. F. Moore, who was assisted until March 1, 1924, by
Mr. P. E. Greeley. After Mr. Greeley’s resignation, Mr. A. H. Wor-
thing assisted from May 20 to June 30, but then resigned. At
Montezuma, Chile, the station continued in charge of Mr. L. B.
Aldrich, assisted by Mr. F. A. Greeley.

Many comforts and observing improvements have been added at
both stations at small expense owing to the ingenuity and hard
manual labor of the observers. At both stations all possible days for
solar-constant work have been utilized, and with very high accuracy
of observation. About 75 per cent of all days were observed in
Arizona and above 80 per cent. in Chile. The months of July,
August, and September, however, were very unfavorable at Harqua
Hala, because of unusual cloudiness which prevailed all over that
section of the United States. This abnormal state of the sky was
indeed made specially prominent by the almost complete failure
of all the California observations of the total solar eclipse of Sep-
tember 10, 1923. Many observations of these months must be
rejected on account of unfavorable sky.

Mr. W. H. Hoover assisted Mr. Moore for a few weeks in May,
1923. While Mr. and Mrs. Moore were away in Australia setting
up near Sydney a solar-radiation outfit ordered by Rev. E. F.
Pigot, of Riverview College, for a committee of interested Aus-
tralians, Mr. and Mrs. Hoover relieved them at Harqua Hala from
July until September. Mr. Hoover was thus prepared by actual
field experience to be director of the Argentine Government’s new
solar-radiation station at La Quiaca.

The outfit for this station was prepared at the Smithsonian In-
stitution after designs of the writer, and the finer parts, such as
those of the bolometer and galvanometer, were constructed by Mr.
Hoover. Shipment was made in January, 1924, and the station at
La Quiaca made ready for solar observing in June, 1924. Thus the
Argentine Government is the first agency outside the Smithsonian
Institution to undertake regular determinations of the variation of
the sun. Their official weather service still receives daily telegraphic
reports from our station at Montezuma, Chile, and it will supple-
ment these by its own solar-radiation measurements at La Quiaca.

Field work at Mount Wilson—The director and Mrs. Abbot occu-
pied this station from July to October, 1923. Three objects were in
view—First, to set up apparatus and begin observations on the varia-
tions of atmospheric ozone after the ingenious spectroscopic method
of Fabry and Buisson. M. Fabry was so kind as to supervise the
ordering in Paris of all the special quartz and fluorite optical parts
needed. Owing to the detached service of the Smithsonian instru-
108 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

ment maker, Mr. Kramer, who was engaged in making the Aus-
tralian and Argentine solar radiation outfits, no work had been done
toward mounting the optical parts for ozone studies or, indeed, to-
ward preparing for other experiments of the expedition. So it hap-
pened that the director spent several weeks on Mount Wilson at
instrument making and was not quite ready to begin the ozone ob-
servations in 1923.

The second object was to test new improvements on the solar
cooker. By the lively interest of Director Stratton, the Bureau of
Standards had constructed by their skillful glass blower, Mr. Sperl-
ing, a long, pyrex-glass, double-walled vacuum tube to inclose the
heater tube of the Mount Wilson solar cooker. As stated in Volume
IV of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, nearly nine-
tenths of the loss of heat had hitherto occurred from the heater tube
within the great mirror. It was to check this loss that the new
device was planned. :

Unfortunately, the aluminum of the mirror was found much de-
teriorated and could not be fully restored by polishing. Hence the
mirror was very inefficient in 1923. Nevertheless, the vacuum tube
showed its efficiency by the fact of the heating of the oven to 175° C.,
or fully 25° C. above the usual maximum temperatures of 1920.
But new troubles arose. The oil circulation became leaky at the new
high temperature, spontaneous combustion of the cotton heat insu-
lation occurred, and the experiments had to be stopped after long-
continued vain attempts to close the leaks by soldering. Also the
vacuum tube, which was really made too long for safety, soon broke
under the unequal heating strains. After this breakage occurred
the maximum temperatures attained were but 120° C., showing that
over 50° C. of advantage came from the employment of the vacuum
device. The experiments seemed so promising that a continuation
of them was arranged for 1924, and new and improved instrumental
constructions were prepared by Mr. Kramer during the winter
months

The third piece of work attempted was with the 100-inch tele-
scope on the energy spectrum of the brighter stars. Messrs. Abbot
and Aldrich had, indeed, done this with moderate success in 1922,
employing the vacuum bolometer and galvanometer. But great
trouble had been found in the use of those instruments at extreme
sensibility. Fortunately, the late Dr. FE. F. Nichols had offered to
have prepared a radiometer of improved design for the work. This
instrument, constructed by Dr. J. D. Tear, proved equally as sensitive
as the bolometer used in 1922, and practically as easy to use as a
meter stick.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 109

~

With it and with a new optical arrangement designed by the
writer, and largely constructed by him, very interesting results were
obtained. The spectra of 10 stars, including the sun, as cast by a
60° flint-glass prism, were measured successfully. As the sun’s energy
spectrum is well known, it was possible to eliminate by comparison
with it all of the chief instrumental and atmospheric losses. Thus
the results appear as stellar energy curves outside our atmosphere,
expressed on the normal or wave-length scale. As the deflections
observed were fairly large, no less than 50 millimeters at maximum
in the spectrum of Betelgeuse, for example, the curves are of very
fair accuracy over most of their extent. It was possible to improve
them in the shorter wave-length region where they were inaccurate
by: employing visual and photographic results of German observers.
Thus the whole of the intense part of the spectrum of the yellow
and red stars and a large part of that of the white and blue ones
were well delineated. From these results good estimates could be
made of the star temperatures on the “ black-body ” basis. Further-
more, estimates of the diameters necessary in “ black bodies” to pro-
duce at those temperatures the observed amounts of energy were
made. It is gratifying to find these results on stellar diameters as
accordant as could be expected with those of Pease made by means
of Michelson’s method of the interferometer. A summary follows:

SUMMARY

The year has been notable for the establishment of daily tele-
graphic solar-constant intejligence from Montezuma, Chile, and
Harqua Hala, Ariz., through the interest and generosity of Mr. John
A. Roebling. Also, due to the same support, experimental tempera-
ture forecasts for New York City, based on these daily reports of
110 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

solar changes, have been regularly submitted by Mr. H. H. Clayton
for certain periods of time in advance. Revision of the solar radia-
tion results of the two stations shows average daily accord to less
than 0.5 per cent in their solar-constant determinations. Observa-
tions have been received from one or both solar-radiation stations
on about 90 per cent of all days. Further experiments with the solar
cooker have resulted in some advancement and have pointed the way
to further progress. Apparatus has been made ready for determina-
tions of atmospheric ozone after the method of Fabry and Buisson.
Highly interesting results on stellar energy spectrum distribution and
on star diameters have been obtained with a Nichols radiometer in co-
operation with the Mount Wilson Observatory of the Carnegie Insti-
tution.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the United States Regional Bureau of the International
Catalogue of Scientific Literature for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1924.

As has been stated in several previous annual reports, political and
financial conditions in Europe, caused by the late war, forced a
suspension of the printing and publishing of the International Cata-
logue after the fourteenth annual issue had been completed in July,
1921. <A total of 240 volumes had been published up to the
time that printing was suspended. This series of publications con-
stitutes a classified index catalogue of the scientific literature of
the world for 14 years, from 1901 to 1914, inclusive, and furnishes
the only example of such work ever published. In spite of numer-
ous attempts to resume publication it has been found impossible
to do so in the face of the continued unsettled condition of inter-
national monetary standards. The continued high price of materials
and labor entering into publishing expenses brings the cost of the
10,000 pages of each annual issue of the catalogue up to impossible
figures when expressed in terms of the depreciated currency of many
of the cooperating countries.

In 1922, finding that immediate resumption of publication was
impossible, an international convention was held in Brussels to con-
sider means whereby the organization could be held intact. A
resolution to this end was suggested by this regional bureau and
was unanimously agreed to. The resolution was:

‘That the convention is of opinion that the international organization should
be kept in being through mutual agreement to continue as far as possible the
work of the regional bureaus until such time as it may be economically pos-
sible to resume publication.

The other countries represented at this convention, as well as
the United States, have since that time lived up to the spirit of this
resolution.

The present aim of this bureau is to collect and record the data
necessary to index the current scientific publications of the United
States without attempting to classify the subjects of the papers
themselves, for before publication is resumed it will be necessary
to completely revise the classification schedules heretofore used in
order to keep abreast with ever advancing scientific discoveries and

11]
112 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924
the consequently changing requirements of investigators and
students.

The need of a definite, concrete, and internationally satisfactory
plan of operation to govern any organization undertaking to index
and classify current scientific literature is now more evident than it
wag 24 years ago when the International Catalogue was founded, for
since the publication of the catalogue by this organization was sus-
pended many plans have been suggested but none have so far been
found satisfactory or practical. Schemes which take into consid-
eration only local or special needs are found useless when world-wide
needs are considered. And when such schemes are compared with
the far-reaching, time-tried, and officially recognized organization
of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, whose scope
embraces all scientific subjects and whose field is world-wide, their
inadequacy is at once apparent.

In aiming to meet the various needs of scientific specialists and
students several forms of service are required:

i. Immediate notices which may be furnished by means of cards
or assembled reference data to meet the requirements of specialists
in restricted fields.

9. Monthly or quarterly classified records furnishing not only
complete index data but also, to meet the needs of general students
as well as specialists, brief abstracts of the subject contents of each
paper noted.

3. Yearly catalogues or yearbooks, each covering a recognized sub-
division of science, collectively furnishing a permanent, assembled,
classified record of all scientific activities. Such collective records
are the only ones suited to meet the needs and requirements of libra-
rians as well as future investigators.

As in the preparation of each of these aids to scientific investi-
eation the same materials are required and the same methods of
indexing and classifying are employed, it is evident that consolida-
tion, or at least close cooperation, should exist between all organiza-
tions undertaking such work.

Many abstracting agencies now exist and attempts are being made
to establish more, but taken collectively they fail to cover all
branches of science and are too dissimilar in their methods and form
of publication to take the place of a concise, classified, permanent
record of scientific publications so urgently needed by specialists
and librarians alike. It was chiefly to meet this need that the Inter-
national Catalogue was originally founded.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the library of the Smithsonian Institution and of the libraries
of the bureaus under its administration for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1924.

The use of the library by members of the Smithsonian staff has
been stimulated by the publication each fortnight in Smithsonian
Local Notes of principal additions to the collections and by the daily
circulation among heads of scientific departments and divisions of
a typewritten list of original articles appearing in periodicals re-
ceived for the main brary.

While the libraries administered under the Smithsonian Institu-
tion are used principally for reference in connection with advanced —
scientific and technological research and special administrative prob-
lems, their facilities are open to all. Every book is available to the
public, through consultation, by borrowing through an accredited
library, or by means of photographic reproduction at the corre-
spondent’s expense.

SMITHSONIAN MAIN LIBRARY

The number of publications received for the main library was
8,678, consisting of 4,044 volumes, 2,126 parts, 2,332 pamphlets,
and 176 charts. The total number of accessions has reached 544,-
980, representing 901,985 publications.

Theses and academic publications were received from abroad
from universities located at the following places: Algiers, Berlin,
Bern, Copenhagen, Dijon, Dorpat, Freiburg, Giessen, Graz, Halle,
Kiel, Konigsberg, Liége, London, Lund, Manchester, Marburg,
Montpellier, Paris, Prague, Rennes, Strasbourg, Tokyo, Utrecht,
Vienna, Warsaw, Wilno, and Ziirich.

Of a total of 3,352 missing parts of incomplete sets requested in
exchange, 1,786 were secured, a percentage of 53.2 as compared
with 43.2 last year.

SMITHSONIAN OFFICE LIBRARY

The loans from the office library were 2,749. The number of
volumes catalogued was 5,348. The number of new titles added to

the author catalogue was 1,125.
113
114 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

The gift of Dr. F. W. Clarke of 170 pamphlets, in continuation
of his collection of papers on the atomic weights, brought the total
number of publications accessioned up to 477.

There were 51 additions to the aeronautical collection. The
growth of this collection during the past decade has been due almost
entirely to the personal efforts of Mr. Paul Brockett, who has secured
for it many rare and valuable works, the acquisition of which would
otherwise have entailed great expense.

The cataloguing of the European Historical Series of the Watts
de Peyster collection is approaching completion.

UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

The library of the National Museum now contains 63,691 volumes
and 101,057 pamphlets, making a total of 164,748 publications. Of
these 1,521 volumes and 2,667 pamphlets represent the increase of
the year; 14,528 parts of periodicals were entered. Owing to lack
of funds, only 163 books were bound.

The number of loans reached a total of 10,577. Many more vol-
umes were consulted without being taken out. There were borrowed
1,929 books from the Library of Congress and 130 from other
libraries.

When it is realized that 6,189 of the library’s loans were made to
the sectional libraries, the importance of the latter will become
readily apparent. The sectional libraries maintained are as follows:

Administration. Mechanical technology.
American archeology. Medicine.

Anthropology. Minerals.

Birds. Mineral technology.
Botany. Mollusks..

Nehinoderms. Old World archeology.
Editor’s office. Paleobotany.

Ethnology. Photography.

Fishes. Physical anthropology.
Foods. Property clerk’s office.
Geology. Reptiles and batrachians.
Graphic arts. Superintendent’s office.
History. Taxidermy.

Insects. Textiles.

Invertebrate paleontology. Vertebrate paleontology.
Mammals. War library.

Marine invertebrates. Wood technology.

The sectional libraries are under the immediate custody of mem-
bers of the administrative and scientific staffs, to whom the Museum
is also indebted for many valuable gifts to the library and timely
suggestions for the increase of its collections in the fields listed
above. Among the donors for the present year should be men-
tioned Messrs. Paul Bartsch, R. S. Bassler, J. E. Benedict, A. G.

B. H. Swales, and Charles D. Walcott. The gifts of Doctor Dall
to the sectional library of mollusks numbered 167 titles. Through
the efforts of Doctor Bassler, the Museum has been fortunate in
securing the library of the late Edgar E. Teller, paleontologist, of
Buffalo, N. Y. The books were received shortly before the close
of the fiscal year.

The number of cards added to the subject catalogue was 2,810.

OTHER BRANCH LIBRARIES

The branch libraries at the Astrophysical Observatory, the Na-
tional Zoological Park, the National Gallery of Art, and the Freer
Gallery of Art received a number of accessions during the year.
The activities of the library of the Bureau of American Ethnology
are covered in the report of the chief of that bureau.

SUMMARY OF RECEIPTS AND ACCESSIONS

The number of pieces of mail received during the year was 28,783,
of which 7,321 publications were Government documents, and were
sent to the Library of Congress, in accordance with the established
practice. Additions to the library, as shown by the accession rec-
ords, are given below.

All payments are made by check, signed by the Secretary of the
Institution, on the Treasurer of the United States, and all revenues
are deposited to the credit of the same account, except in some in-
stances small deposits are placed in bank for convenience of collec-
tion and later are withdrawn in round amounts and deposited in the
Treasury.

The practice of investing temporarily idle funds in time deposits
has proven satisfactory. During the year the interest derived from
this source, together with other similar items, has resulted in a
total of $1,014.59.

The following appropriations were intrusted by Congress to the
care of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year 1924:

PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE SMITH-
SONIAN INSTITUTION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JUNE
30, 1924

ANNUAL MEETING, DECEMBER 13, 1923

Present: The Hon. William H. Taft, Chief Justice of the United
States; Senator Henry Cabot Lodge; Representative Albert John-
son; Representative R. Walton Moore; the Hon. George Gray; the
Hon. Henry White; Mr. Robert S. Brookings; Mr. Irwin Laughlin;
Mr. Frederic A. Delano; and the secretary, Dr. Charles D. Walcott.

Judge Gray, as temporary chairman, called the meeting to order.

ELECTION OF A CHANCELLOR

The secretary said that the office of chancellor, to which Mr. Cool-
idge was elected by the board during his incumbency as Vice Presi-
dent, had been vacated by his elevation to the Presidency. Under
the law organizing the Institution (sec. 5582), “ The regents shall
meet in the city of Washington, and elect one of their number as
chancellor, who shall be the presiding officer of the Board of Regents.
and called the chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution.”

Senator Lodge offered the following resolution, which was
adopted :

Resolved, That Chief Justice Taft be elected chancellor of the Smithsonian
Institution.

APPOINTMENT OF REGENT

The secretary announced the reappointment of Senator Henry
Cabot Lodge as a Regent.

RESOLUTION RELATIVE TO INCOME AND EXPENDITURE

Judge Gray, chairman of the executive committee, presented the
following resolution, which on motion was adopted:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1925, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by
the secretary with the advice of the executive committee, with full discretion
on the part of the secretary as to items.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

The secretary submitted in printed form the annual report of the

_ executive committee, giving a statement of the financial condition
| of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1923.

128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924
ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE

The secretary, on behalf of the permanent committee, read the
report, as follows:

Hodgkins and Roebling funds.—Work is continuing steadily in the solar
radiation researches being conducted on the Montezuma Mountain, Chile, un-
der an annual grant of $5,000 from the Hodgkins fund. Mr. John A. Roebling
has added generously to his contributions to aid the work at this station, and
also at the one on Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz. These researches are being car-
ried on under the direction of Dr. Charles G. Abbot, assistant secretary of the
Institution and director of the Astrophysical Observatory.

Freer bequest.—The balance of the loan of $200,000 made to settle this estate
was paid during the year.

In view of the fact that the Freer Foundation is invested entirely in Parke,
Davis & Co.’s stock, the permanent committee took up the matter of safeguard-
ing its principal and income; and, after careful consideration, decided upon
what may be termed a sinking fund, by which that part of the income in ex-
cess of 6 per cent on the value of the foundation at the time of Mr. Freer’s
death is to be reinvested in high-class securities and real-estate mortgages
until an amount equal to the original foundation is reached.

Poore bequest.—Negotiations are now pending for the sale of several of the
lots in Lowell, Mass., received under this bequest, which will net the Institu-
tion about $1,500. The remaining lots will be disposed of as opportunity offers.
Since the last meeting of the board the city of Lowell has agreed to abate the
taxes on this property. .

All the other funds previously detailed are in sound condition and are slowly
but steadily increasing in volume through the addition of their earnings to
the principal.

_ The consolidated fund, which comprises bequests and gifts to the Institu-
tion in addition to the $1,000,000 deposited in the United States Treasury in

In submitting his annual report of the operations of the Institu-
tion for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1923, the secretary stated
that the publications of the Institution are its chief means of carry-
ing out one of its primary functions, the “diffusion of knowledge
among men.” Since the last annual meeting of this board, in Decem-
ber 1922, the Institution and its branches have issued a total of 98
publications, both volumes and pamphlets. Of this number, 49 were
published by the Institution proper, 44 by the National Museum, 4
by the Bureau of American Ethnology, and 1 by the National Gallery
of Art. A large part of the edition of each of these publications is
distributed free to libraries, educational institutions, and specialists
throughout the world. The nation-wide popularity of the Smith-
sonian Annual Report is attested by the fact that a cataloguer in the
office of the Superintendent of Documents has placed it first among
all public documents in number of requests from libraries to receive
it. In connection with the publications, the secretary called atten-
tion to the inadequacy of the funds available for printing.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART COMMISSION

The third annual meeting of the National Gallery of Art Commis-
sion was held December 11, 1923. The resignation of Mr. Daniel
Chester French as chairman of the commission was received and ac-
cepted with regret, and Mr. Gari Melchers was elected chairman.

The report of the secretary of the commission and director of the
gallery presented a review of the activities of the gallery for the
year, and reports of the standing and special committees followed.

In response to the resolution submitted by the Regents, February
8, 1923, requesting the commission’s consideration of the suggestion
that a museum of architecture be founded in connection with the
Institution, the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the National Gallery of Art Commission recommend to the
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution the inclusion of a division of his-
torical architecture in the National Gallery of Art. The division should seek
to establish standards in architecture, furniture, and landscape architecture
for the benefit of students and others interested in the preservation of the
historic buildings of America.

The important problem of a national gallery building was con-
sidered and assurance given that the building plans would be pro-
vided for in the near future.

A resolution was passed recommending to the Board of Regents
the election of Mr. James E. Fraser and Mr. Joseph Breck to fill
vacancies caused by the resignation of Mr. Daniel Chester French
and the declination of Mr. Denman W. Ross.

The commission also voted to recommend to the Board of Regents
the election for the full term of four years of Messrs. Edwin H.
Blashfield, Joseph H. Gest, and Frank Jewett Mather, jr., their
two-year terms having expired.

After discussion, the following resolutions were adopted:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution approves
in principle the recommendation of the National Gallery of Art Commission
that a division of historical architecture be established in connection with the
National Gallery of Art.

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby
elects Mr. James E. Fraser and Mr. Joseph Breck as members of the commis-
sion, to fill the vacancies caused by the resignation of Mr. Daniel Chester
French and the declination of Mr. Denman W. Ross, respectively.

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby
elects Messrs. Edwin H. Blashfield, Joseph H. Gest, and Frank Jewett Mather,
jr., as members of the National Gallery of Art Commission for the full terin
of four years, their present two-year terms having expired.

MEMORIAL TO ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL

On behalf of the executive committee, the secretary submitted the
following report:
DECEMBER 13, 1923.
GENTLEMEN: The executive committee, designated by the Board of Regents:
at its annual meeting on December 14, 1922, to prepare for the records of the-
130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

board a brief memorial commemorating the life and work of Doctor Bell, a
former Regent of the Institution, begs to submit the following:

“Alexander Graham Bell, doctor of philosophy, doctor of science, a member
of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, was born March 32,
1847, at Edinburgh, Scotland.

“Doctor Bell was appointed a Regent on January 24, 1898, and served until

February 20, 1922. During this entire period of 24 years he was a member of
the executive and permanent committees of the board, where his sound judg-
ment and ripe experience were of great assistance to his associates.
* “Doctor Bell’s interest in the work of the Smithsonian Institution began
many years before his appointment as Regent, his studies in acoustics par-
ticularly having been the subject of many consultations with Secretary Henry.
Later, in 1887, when Samuel P. Langley was elected secretary, he resumed
his intimate though unofficial relations, as evidenced by his gift of $5,000 in
1891 in connection with the development of the Astrophysical Observatory, and
his helpful interest in the aerodynamical researches of Secretary Langley. It
was Doctor Bell who made the only successful photograph of the Langley
model in its first flight, May 6, 1896, though at this time he was independently
conducting exhaustive experiments in this new science.

“After he became a Regent, Doctor Bell was likewise active in forwarding
the work of the Institution in many directions. Among the notable matters
that particularly engaged his personal attention were:

“His voluntary service in transferring the remains of James Smithson,
founder of the Institution, from the English cemetery at Genoa, Italy, to their
final resting place in the Smithsonian Building

“His suggestion that resulted in the establishment of the Langley medal
in connection with the development of aviation ;

“His labors as a member of the committee on award of this medal; and

“His historical address upon Secretary Langley’s discovery of the principles
of aviation, delivered February 10, 1910, at the presentation of the Langley
medal to its first recipients, the Wright brothers.

* Doctor Bell had reached a high eminence in the scientific world iene before
his connection with the Institution. The history of his achievements is too
well known to be repeated here; but it is proper to mention his invention of
the telephone; his great work in the physiology of human speech that made
it possible for him to teach the deaf to speak; and his invention of the tele-
phone probe for detecting the presence of bullets in the human body. He was
a believer in geographic research and was one of the founders of the National
Geographic Society. He was a member of the National Academy of Sci-
ences, and of other national and international learned organizations, and was
the recipient of many medals, degrees, and other honors as a man of great
scientific achievement.

“ Doctor Bell had a strong physique, but the strain of many years of intense
endeavor made itself felt, and he found it necessary to give up much of his
work in the last year or two of his life. His weakness increased until the
end came on August 2, 1922, at his summer home near Baddeck, Nova Scotia.

“ Alexander Graham Bell was one of the outstanding men of his time,
and his death brought a highly useful career to a close.”

Respectfully submitted.

RADIO CELEBRATION OF JOSEPH HENRY’S BIRTHDAY

The secretary called attention to the birthday of Henry, first sec-
retary of the Smithsonian Institution, which is to be celebrated by
radio on December 17. The occasion will be observed by appropri-
ate addresses broadcast from the stations ‘at Troy and Schenectady,
N. Y.

Joseph Henry was born at Albany on December 17, 1799. His
first studies in electricity began in 1827, while he was a teacher in
the Albany Academy, and in the course of his researches he trans-
formed an inefficient piece of electrical apparatus into the powerful
electromagnet, and laid the foundation for the most important dis-
coveries of the century. He made two distinct forms of magnets;
one capable of excitation at a distance, called the “ intensity magnet,”
and the other having possibilities of infinite development of strength,
which he named the “ quantity magnet.”

Before Henry, the strongest form of electromagnet known could
lift only 9 pounds, but after a few months of experiment he pro-
duced one which sustained 39 pounds. This was successively fol-
lowed by others which could support 750, 2,300, and 3,500 pounds.
The intensity magnet was the forerunner of the modern telegraph,
and in 1831 Henry transmitted a current through a considerable
length of wire and succeeded in ringing a bell. On December 1%,
92 years later, this identical bell will be rung during the ceremonies,
and the sound will be heard by listeners throughout the United States
and probably across the Atlantic. The bell is now a treasured relic
in the New York State Museum at Albany.

When the Smithsonian Institution was founded, Joseph Henry
was selected as its first secretary, and his plan of organization for
the new Institution was carried out. His broad-minded policies en-
abled the Institution to become firmly established, and through its
stated purpose, “the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men,” to attain a world-wide reputation as a center of scientific ac-
tivity in America. During Henry’s term as secretary (1846-1878) he
inaugurated the system of daily meteorological observations and re-
ports which developed into the present United States Weather
Bureau.

EXPEDITIONS

Archeological expedition to China.—The archeological expedition
sent to China last February under the joint auspices of the Freer
Gallery of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, and under the
immediate direction of Mr. Carl W. Bishop, associate curator of the
Freer Gallery, seems already to have paved the way for a far better
approach to the problems of Chinese archeology than has ever ex-
isted before. Mr. Bishop’s first duties have been to make clear to
132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

interested Chinese the spirit and purpose of the expedition, to estab-
lish among them a feeling of confidence in its integrity and ability,
and to organize a self-sustaining archeological society of native
scholars which should have the official sanction and support of the
Chinese Government in all its undertakings. These delicate and
difficult tasks Mr. Bishop has prosecuted with an extraordinary
degree of skill and success. The archeological society, with head-
quarters in Peking and a membership composed of the most influen-
tial scholars and Government officials, has already made arrange-
ments with the authorities for the expedition to undertake the exca-
vation of two highly important sites, on the understanding that
while the records and reports of the operations shall be at its disposal
the material “ finds” shall be equally divided between the Chinese
Government and the expedition.

Mr. Bishop also has been fortunate enough to acquire for the
expedition several fine examples of Chinese art, but it is his success
in establishing for the first time a truly cooperative relationship
between Chinese and American archeologists which must be thought
to justify the expedition, even had it accomplished nothing else.

Biological expedition to China——Through the continued generos-
ity of Dr. William L. Abbott, of Philadelphia, an expedition to the
Yangtze Valley, in China, was arranged for the purpose of obtain-
ing specimens of vertebrates peculiar to that locality, and Mr.
Charles M. Hoy, who had previously explored in the central China
region, left the United States for this purpose in December, 1922.
I greatly regret to report that in September, 1923, Mr. Hoy was
seized with an acute attack of appendicitis and that his death oc-
curred on the 6th of that month. This is a serious loss to the Mu-
seum, but, thanks to Doctor Abbott, arrangements have been made
to turn Mr. Hoy’s collecting and field outfit over to the Rev. D. C.
Graham, of Suifu, from whom several valuable sendings have been
received, and who is contemplating extensive excursions into the
more interesting and little known parts of Szechwan.

Doctor Abbott’s generosity has been frequently called to the atten-
tion of the board, large contributions having been made by him for
the expeditions to Borneo, Celibes, Australia, and the present ones
in China, in addition to which he has given largely from the results
of his personal efforts in Haiti and elsewhere.

Alberta and British Columbia—During the summer and fall of
1923, the secretary of the Institution carried on geological field work
in the Canadian Rockies in this region. This work was in continua-
tion of the operations of the previous year in the main range and the
western minor ranges that form the great eastern wall of the Colum-
bia River Valley from Golden southward to Kootenay River.

The season was favorable for geological work, and a large supply
of material was secured which will he studied later.

REORGANIZATION OF GOVERNMENT DEPARTMENTS

The secretary spoke of the proposed reorganization of Government
Departments, under which it was proposed to include the Smith-
sonian Institution in a Department of Education.

The following considerations were mentioned among others:

1. A large part of the success which the Institution has had in
carrying on and aiding research work hag been due to the fact that
varying political fortunes have no effect on its direction. Its secre-
tary is selected by the Board of Regents provided for in the act
creating the Institution. It is thus enabled to pursue a definite and
continuous policy which is unaffected by political changes.

2. During the 77 years of its existence as an independent establish-
ment the Smithsonian Institution has acquired a reputation and
standing throughout the civilized world as a center of scientific
endeavor in America. To place it in the position of a subordinate
member of an educational department would impair its standing
and so relegate it to an unimportant position far from the intention of
its founder, of the act of Congress establishing the Institution, and of
those who have since made large gifts to it, principally because it
was independent of political and sectarian domination.

3. Freedom of action, one of its chief assets in various scientific
activities and in international undertakings, would be entirely lost
if the Institution were placed under the administration of a political
unit of the Government.

There was a very general expression of disapproval of the proposed
plan.

NEED OF AN ADDITIONAL ASSISTANT SECRETARY

The secretary stated that there was urgent need for the provision
for an assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, to be
charged, under the direction of the secretary, with the administra-
tion of the National Museum, Art Galleries, Zoological Park, and
the Bureau of American Ethnology, and with such other duties as
may from time to time be assigned to him by the secretary. The
care and development of these four branches involve the employ-
ment of highly trained specialists and their assistants, and the coordi-
nation of the activities of each group with those of the other groups
and also with those of research and technical workers in the great
Government bureaus, such as those of the Agriculture, Interior, and
Commerce Departments, and the great research institutions and uni-
versity laboratories throughout our country and in foreign lands.
Such coordination requires the initiative, guidance, and constant
supervision of an able, well-trained, and experienced broadly cul-
134 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

tured scientific man who must also have considerable administrative
ability.

After full discussion, on motion, the following resolution was
adopted :

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution declare
the need of an additional assistant secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
whose salary shall be provided for by congressional appropriation; the said
assistant secretary to be charged with the administration, under the direction
of the secretary, of the National Museum, Art Galleries, Zoological Park, and
Bureau of American Ethnology, and with such other duties as may from time
to time be assigned to him by the secretary.

FINANCIAL OUTLOOK

The secretary spoke of the urgent need of a larger endowment for
the institution; that work of the most important character was
being held back for lack of funds to carry it on.

The secretary presented a supplemental statement giving a brief
résumé of the activities of the various branches of the Institution
during the past fiscal year. These will be described more fully in
the annual report for 1924.

REGULAR MEETING, FEBRUARY 14, 1924

Present: Senator A. Owsley Stanley; Representative R. Walton
Moore; Representative Walter H. Newton; Mr. Charles F. Choate,
jr.; Mr. Robert S. Brookings; Mr. Irwin B. Laughlin; and the sec-
retary, Dr. Charles D. Walcott. Mr. Choate presided.

APPOINTMENT OF REGENTS

The secretary announced that the Speaker of the House had reap-
pointed Messrs. Albert Johnson and R. Walton Moore as Regents
and had filled the vacancy caused by Mr. Greene’s election to the
Senate by the appointment of Mr. Walter H. Newton, of Minnesota.

BUILDING FOR ART AND HISTORY

The secretary spoke of the proposed building for the National
Gallery of Art and History, displaying sketch plans of its general
outline and its location, stating that it comprehended a building
somewhat over 500 feet long by 300 feet deep, with an elevation of
about 80 feet. He quoted the act granting the use of the site on
B Street NW., between Seventh and Ninth Streets.

ARCHITECT FOR ART AND HISTORY BUILDING

At the annual meeting of the board, on December 13, 1923, the
National Gallery of Art Commission reported that provision would
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS 1385

be made in the near future for the preparation of building plans for
the proposed new building. The commission met recently and re-
ported that funds for the employment of an architect had been pro-
vided by private contributions from 13 persons to the amount of
$11,000. The commission, having canvassed the names of a number
of American architects who had been suggested as qualified to pre-
pare the plans, recommended the selection of Mr. Charles A. Platt,
whose selection was approved by the Board of Regents.

After discussion, a motion was adopted appointing Messrs. White
and Delano, of the Board of Regents; Messrs. Adams, Melchers, and
Gest, of the commission; and the secretary of the Institution as a
committee to collaborate ea the apelibeet) in the preparation of the
plans for the new building.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

The secretary read a letter from Mr. Gilbert H. Grosvenor express-
ing the appreciation of the family of the late Dr. A. Graham Bell
for the memorial adopted by the board at the annual meeting on
December 13 last.

SPECIAL MEETING, JUNE 38, 1924

Present: Senator Henry Cabot Lodge; Representative Albert
Johnson; Representative Walter H. Newton; the Hon. George Gray;
Mr. Henry White; and the secretary, Dr. Charles D. Walcott.
Senator Lodge presided.

AUTHORITY FOR CALLING SPECIAL MEETINGS

The secretary explained that the fundamental act provides for
calling special meetings at the request of three Regents, and that
this meeting had been called by the executive committee and ap-
proved by the chancellor.

ADDITIONAL ASSISTANT SECRETARY

The secretary brought up the matter of an additional assistant
secretary, explaining that at the annual meeting on December 13,
1923, the Board of Regents adopted a resolution declaring the need
of such an officer, which had been communicated to the President.
With the President’s approval, the Director of the Budget sub-
mitted the request to Congress, after the Personnel Classification
Board had put the position in class 6. The Appropriations Com-
mittee fixed the annual salary at $6,000, and the item was now
included in the independent offices bill under “Smithsonian Insti-
tution.”
136 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

ESTIMATES FOR NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

The secretary stated that—

Estimates are at present submitted by the Smithsonian Institution to the
District Commissioners (a copy is forwarded direct to the Bureau of the
Budget) for inclusion in the District of Columbia estimates. The commissioners
forward these to the Bureau of the Budget with all other estimates int@nded for
the District of Columbia appropriation bill. The Director of the Budget
returns the complete estimates to the District Commissioners with a state-
ment as to the maximum figures that will be allowed the District for the whole
bill. It is the duty of the commissioners to reduce the estimates to this
figure and return to the Bureau of the Budget.

The District Commissioners have their own troubles and urgent require-
ments, and, since the allotment made is far under their own estimates, it is
only natural that they should give first consideration to items for which
they are directly responsible—streets, sewers, fire and police protection,
schools, ete. In the three years since the Zoological Park has been included
in the District bill, no hearings of any kind have been given the Institution
on the Zoo estimates by the District Commissioners. For two years the
estimates were simply reduced to the figures for the previous year and re-
turned to the Budget without the Institution even knowing the amount thus
approved by the commissioners. The commissioners even changed all figures
in the detailed statement accompanying the estimates to agree exactly with
those of the preceding year, thus presenting to the Budget and later to Con-
gress useless and misleading figures in explanation of the proposed ex-
penditures.

I do not think that the District Commissioners should be given the arbi-
trary power to control the finances of the National Zoological Park, which is
placed by law under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution.

It should be practicable to include the estimate for the Zoological Park in
the independent offices bill along with the other estimates for Government
bureaus administered under the direction of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution. The latter are held responsible for the care and
administration of the park and there should be no divided responsibility in
natters bearing upon its administration.

After discussion, on motion of Mr. Newton, the following resolu-
tion was adopted:

Resolved, That it is the sense of this meeting of the Board of Regents that
the appropriation for the National Zoological Park should be carried in the
independent offices bill, as are the items for the other Government bureaus
administered under the direction of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Tustitution.
GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1924

137
ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Genera, Appenprx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such
papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific
progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geol-
ogy, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology,
and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not alto-
gether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them orig-
inal) embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and
discussion. This method has been continued in the present report
for 1924.

THE ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM?

By J. H. JEANS
Secretary, Royal Society of London

[With 5 plates]

The astronomer of to-day has at his disposal telescopes which
range in aperture from his naked eye, of aperture about one-fifth
of an inch, up to the giant Mount Wilson telescope of more than
100 inches. If we lived in the midst of a uniform infinite field of
stars, or in a field which was uniform as far as our telescopes could
reach, the numbers of stars visible in different telescopes would be
proportional to the cubes of their apertures.

In actual fact our naked eyes reveal about 5,000 stars; with a one-
inch telescope this number is increased to about 100,000, with a
10-inch to 5,000,000, and with the 100-inch telescope to perhaps
100,000,000. ‘These numbers increase much less rapidly than the
cubes of the apertures. We conclude that we are not surrounded by
an infinite uniform field of stars. We live in a finite universe, which
thins out quite perceptibly within distances reached by telescopes
of very moderate size. It is estimated that the whole universe con-
sists of some 1,500 million stars, our sun being not very far from the
center of the system.

Imagine the various celestial objects in this universe arranged
according to their distance from us. Disregarding altogether bodies
which are much smaller than our earth, we must give first place to
the planets Venus and Mars, which approach to within 26 and 35
millions of miles, respectively. Next comes Mercury with a closest
approach of 47 million miles, and the sun at 93 million miles. The
remainder of the planets follow at distances ranging up to 2,800
million miles, the radius of the orbit of Neptune.

But now comes a great gap. The first objects beyond this gap
are the faint star Proxima Centauri at a distance of 24 million
million miles, or more than 8,000 times the distance of Neptune,
and, close to it, a Centauri at 25 million million miles. Next in
order come the faint red star Munich 15,040 at 36 million million

140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

miles, and another faint star Lalande 21,185 at about 47 million
million miles. Thus our nearest neighbors among the stars are at
almost exactly a million times the distances of our nearest neighbors
among the planets. After these comes Sirius, the brightest star in
the sky, at 50 million million miles. From here on there is a steady
succession of objects until we reach distances of more than 20,000
times that of Sirius; but long before these distances are reached
other objects, spiral and spheroidal nebule, and ultimately star
clusters, are found to be mingled with the stars. The furthest
object the distance of which is known with any accuracy is the
star cluster N. G. C. 7006, which Shapley estimates to be 25,000
times as distant as Sirius. This cluster is so remote that its hight
takes 200,000 years to reach us; even for light to cross the cluster
takes hundreds of years. To all appearances the star cloud N. G. C.
6822 is still more remote. According to Shapley, its distance is
about 6 million million million miles, a distance which light takes
a million years to traverse. So far as is known at present, this
brings us to the end of our universe, or perhaps I ought to say it
brings us back to the beginning.

It is no easy matter to get all these different distances clearly
into focus simultaneously, but let us try. The earth speeds round
the sun at about twenty miles a second; in a year it describes an
orbit of nearly 600 million miles circumference. If we represent
the earth’s orbit by a pinhead or a full stop of radius one-hundredth
of an inch, the sun will be an invisible speck of dust, and the earth
an ultramicroscopic particle one-millionth of an inch in diameter.
Neptune’s orbit, which incloses the whole of the solar system, will
be represented by a circle the size of a threepenny piece, while the
distance to the nearest star, Proxima Centauri, will be about 75
yards and that to Sirius about 160 yards. On this same scale the
distance to the remote star cluster N. G. C. 7006 is 2,400 miles and
that to the star cloud N. G. C. 6822 about 12,000 miles, so that
roughly speaking the whole universe may be represented by our
earth.

It thus appears that we are on this occasion to discuss the origin
and past history of a system which bears the same relation to the
universe as a whole as does a threepenny piece to our earth. Why
are we so interested in this particular threepenny piece? Primarily
because, although a poor thing, it is our own, or at least one particle
of it, one-millionth of an inch in diameter, is our own. But there is
a historical reason of a less sentimental kind. We have already
noticed the immensity of the gap between our system and its nearest
neighbors. As regards astronomical knowledge this gap has taken
a great deal of crossing. Well on into last century, human knowl-
|

ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 141

edge of the further side of this gap was infinitesimal; the stars were
scarcely more than points of light, described as “fixed stars.” In
those days the problem of cosmogony reduced perforce to the prob-
lem of the origin of our own system.

Recent research has changed all this, and the modern astronomer
has a very extensive knowledge of the nature, structure, and move-
ments of the various bodies outside our system. The cosmogonist
of a century ago could assert that the solar system had evolved in
such and such a way, and need have no fear of his theories being
upset by comparison with other systems. But if I put before you
now a theory of the origin of our system, you will at once inquire as
to the behavior of the 1,500 million or so of systems beyond the
great gap. Are they following the same evolutionary course as our
own system, and, if not, why not? It may be well to consider thes
other systems first.

Among these 1,500 million or so of objects there are certain com-
paratively small classes the nature and interpretation of which are
still enigmatical—the planetary nebule, the Cepheid variables, the
long-period variables such as Mira Ceti, and a few others. Apart
from these, practically all known bodies can be arranged in one single
continuous sequence. The sequence is approximately one of increas-
ing density; it begins with nebule of almost incredible tenuity and
ends with solid stars as dense as iron. There is but little doubt that
the sequence is an evolutionary one, for the laws of physics require
that as a body radiates heat its density should increase, at least until
it can increase no further. Let us begin our survey at the furthest
point back to which we can attain on this evolutionary chain—the -
nebule.

After the enigmatical “ planetary ” nebule have been excluded, the
remaining nebul fall into two fairly sharply defined classes, which
may be briefly described as regularly and irregularly shaped nebule.

The irregularly shaped nebule comprise such objects as the great
nebula in Orion, and the nebulosity surrounding the Pleiades.
Until quite recently these irregular nebule were supposed to be of
great evolutionary importance. It was noticed that they were
usually associated with the very hottest stars; whence arose a
beautifully simple cosmogony asserting that these very hot stars
were the immediate products of condensation of the nebulz, and that
their after life consisted merely of a gradual cooling until they got
quite cold. This cosmogony was too simple to live for long—it was
buried some ten years ago by the researches of Russell, Hertzsprung,
and others. Thanks to these researches, we now know that the very
hot stars associated with irregular nebule, so far from being newly
born, are standing at the summit of their lives awaiting their decline
into old age.
142 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

A mass of hot gas isolated in space radiates heat, and this causes
it to contract. If the mass radiated without contracting, it would,
of course, get cooler; on the other hand, if it contracted without
radiating, it would get hotter. But when radiation and contraction
are proceeding together it is not obvious without mathematical in-
vestigation which of the two tendencies will take command. In 1870
Homer Lane showed that a mass of gas of density low enough for
the ordinary gas laws to be approximately obeyed, will in actual fact
get hotter as it radiates heat away. Cooling does not set in until a
density is reached at which the gas laws are already beginning to
fail—that is to say when liquefaction and solidification are already
within measurable distance. Thus we see that maximum temper-
ature is associated with middle age in a star, the age at which the
star may no longer be regarded as a perfect gas. At this period of
middle age the surface temperature of the star may be anything up
to about 25,000° C., while the temperature at its center will amount
to millions of degrees. Its average density will probably be some-
thing like one-tenth of that of water. It is still not known why
stars at this special maximum temperature are so commonly asso-
ciated with irregular nebule. Possibly it may be that only stars at
the very highest temperatures are capable of lighting up surrounding
nebulosity which would otherwise remain invisible. Be this as it
may, it is fairly clear that these irregular nebular masses are not an
essential part of the evolutionary chain. They are probably mere
by-products, and as such may be dismissed from further con-
sideration.

We turn to the nebule of regular shape. A great number of
these appear as circles or ellipses, some as ellipses drawn out at the
ends of their major-axes, sometimes almost to sharp points. An
example of this last type of figure is shown in Plate 1, Figure 1
(Nebula N. G. C. 3115).

A number of these regular-shaped nebule have been examined
spectroscopically, and in every case have been found to be rotating
with high velocities about an axis which appears in the sky as the
shortest diameter of the nebula. The mathematician can calculate
what configurations will be assumed by masses of tenuous gas in
rotation. If rotation were entirely absent the mass would, of ‘course,
assume a spherical shape. With slow rotation its shape would be
an oblate spheroid of low ellipticity—an orange-shaped figure like
our earth. At higher rotations the spheroidal shape is departed
from, the equator bulging out more and more until finally, for quite
rapid rotation, the shape is approximately that of a double convex
lens having a sharp circular edge for its equator, the shape, in fact,
exhibited by the nebula shown in Plate 1, Figure 1. The whole
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 1438

succession of figures, if looked at along all possible lines of sight,
will exhibit precisely the series of shapes which are found to be
exhibited by the regular nebule under discussion. There are, then,
good grounds for conjecturing that these nebule are rotating masses
of gas; but we can test this conjecture further before finally ac-
cepting it.

As a mass of gas radiates its energy away it must shrink. If it
is in rotation, its angular momentum will remain constant, and the
shrunken mass can only carry its original dose of angular momentum
by rotating more rapidly than before. This conception, which
formed the corner-stone of the cosmogonies of Kant and Laplace, is
still of fundamental importance to the cosmogonist of to-day. Thus
every nebula, as it grows older, will rotate ever more and more
rapidly and, barring accidents, will in due course reach the configura-
tion shown in Plate 1, Figure 1. This configuration marks a verita-
ble landmark in the evolutionary path of a nebula. Until this con-
figuration is reached the effect of shrinkage can be adjusted, and
is adjusted, by a mere change of shape; the mass carries the same
angular momentum as before, in spite of its reduced size, by the
simple expedient of rotating more rapidly, and restores equilibrium
by bulging out its equator. But mathematical analysis shows that
this is no longer possible when once this landmark has been passed.
Further shrinkage now involves an actual break-up of the nebula,
the excess of the angular momentum beyond that which can be
carried by the shrunken mass being thrown off into space by the
ejection of matter from the equator of the nebula.

We have so far spoken of the nebular equator as being of circular
shape, as it undoubtedly would be if the nebula were alone by itself
in space. But an actual nebula must have neighbors, and these
neighbors will raise tides on its surface, just as the sun and moon
raise tides on the surface of the rotating earth. Whatever the neigh-
bors are, there will always be two points of high tide antipodally
opposite to one another, and two points of low tide intermediate be-
tween the two points of high tide. Thus the equator, instead of
being strictly circular, will be slightly elliptical.

If the equator of the nebula had been a perfect circle, and if the
nebula had been in all respects symmetrical about its axis of rota-
tion, the ejection of matter would have started from all points of
the equator simultaneously. Indeed, there could be no conceivable
reason why it should start at one point rather than at any other
point. But in nature we do not expect to find perfect balances of
this kind; if the main factors are of exactly equal weight some
quite minor factor invariably intervenes to turn the balance in one
direction or another. In the present problem there could be no
144 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

choice as between one point of the equator and another if the various
minor factors were absent, but when these minor factors come into
play, a discrimination at once takes place. Assuming, as seems
likely, that the tidal irregularities are the minor factors which de-
termine the choice of points for the ejection of matter, mathematical
investigation shows that the ejection of matter will take place from
the two antipodal points on the equator at which the tide is highest.
The equator being slightly elliptical, these points are of course the
ends of its major-axis. After the nebula has passed its critical land-
mark, shown in Plate 1, Figure 1, its shape ought to be similar to the
lenticular figure which formed the landmark, but with the additional
feature of matter streaming out from two antipodal points on its
equator.

This describes exactly what is observed in the spiral nebule. Plate
1, Figure 2 (N. G. C. 5866) shows a nebula in which the ejection
of matter is just beginning; we notice the bulge along the equator
and the dark band which we may assume represents ejected matter
which is already cooling. Plate 2, Figure 1 (N. G. C. 4594) exhibits
a more advanced state of development; and Plate 2, Figure 2 (N.
G. C. 891), a still later one in which the ejected matter already
dwarfs the central nucleus in size, although probably not in total
mass.

In all these figures we are looking at the nebule very approxi-
mately edge-on. Plate 3, Figure 1 (M. 51) shows the well-known
“ whirlpool” in Canes Venatici, a nebula which may be very similar
physically to that shown in Plate 2, Figure 2, but we see it face on;
we are looking along its axis of rotation. Again the central nucleus
occupies only a small part of the picture. Plate 3, Figure 2 (M. 101)
and Plate 4, Figure 1 (M. 81) shows two nebule, the evolution of
which has proceeded still further, so much so that in the last of
these there is very little nucleus left, and by far the greater part of
what we see is what we believe to be ejected matter.

In both of these last two nebule it will be seen that the arms of
ejected matter proceed from two antipodal points, exactly as re-
quired by dynamical theory. So far we have spoken of the matter
in these arms as ejected matter because theory has suggested this
interpretation, but we need not be satisfied with theory; there is
very direct observational evidence on the point. Various astrono-
mers, especially Van Maanen, have detected motion in the arms of
many nebule, including the three shown in Plate 3, Figures 1 and 2,
and Plate 4, Figure 1. Their observations show that the arms are in
truth jets of matter coming out of the nucleus. Plate 4, Figure 2
shows the motion found by Van Maanen for about 100 points in the
nebula M. 81, the arrows showing the motion in a period of 1,300
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 145

years,” and the measures on the various other nebule show sub-
stantially similar results; you will see that there is little room for

doubting that the arms consist of matter flowing out of the nucleus.
On measuring the actual velocities of flow it is found that in nebula
M. 51 (pl. 3, fig. 1) a particle of the jet makes a complete
revolution around the nucleus in about 45,000 years; in M. 81 (pl.
4, fig. 1) the corresponding figure is about 58,000 years, and in M.
101 (pl. 3, fig. 2) about 85,000 years. From these figures it is
possible to estimate the density of the matter in the nucleus. It is
found that the densities must be of the order of 107° gm. per cubic
centimeter, a figure representing a vacuum more perfect than any
obtainable in the laboratory. The small amount of gas in an ordi-
nary electric light bulb, if spread out through St. Paul’s Cathedral,
would still be something like 10,000 times as dense as the nucleus
of a spiral nebula.

The nebula shown in Plate 2, Figure 2 exhibits a lumpy or granu-
lated appearance in its arms. In M. 51 (pl. 3, fig. 1) this takes the
form of pronounced condensations, and in the outer regions of M.
101 (pl. 3, fig. 2) and M. 81 (pl. 4, fig. 1) these condensations have
further developed into detached and almost star-like points of light.

When gas is set free out of an ordinary nozzle into a vacuum it
immediately spreads into the whole of the space accessible to it.
Why then does not the jet of gas shot off from the equator of the
nebula do the same? The explanation is to be found in the gigantic
scale on which this latter process takes place. As we increase the
scale of the phenomenon the mutual gravitational attraction of the
particles of gas becomes of ever greater importance until finally, by
the time nebular dimensions are reached, gravitation overcomes the
expansive influence of gas pressure and is able to hold the jet to-
gether as a compact stream. But, as soon as this happens, dynamical
theory predicts that a further phenomenon ought to appear. As
regards the distribution of density along the filament, the influence
of gas-pressure is in the direction of keeping the density spread out
uniformly, while that of gravitation is toward making the stream
condense with compact globules. When nebular dimensions are
reached the latter tendency prevails, and the issuing jet of gas breaks
up into drops much as a jet of water issuing from a nozzle does,
although for a very different physical reason. In the photographs
reproduced in Plate 2, Figure 2; Plate 3, Figures 1 and 2; and
Plate 4, Figure 1, we can trace this process going on.

Dynamical theory not only predicts that these globules of gas
must form, but also enables us to calculate their size, mass, and

2'The points surrounded by small circles are stars which are believed to have no physi-
cal connection with the nebula.
146 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

distance apart. A comparison between their distance apart, as cal
culated in kilometers, and their angular distance apart, as observed
in the sky, leads at once to an estimate of the distance of the nebula

to which they belong. It is gratifying to find that estimates of |
nebular distances made in this way are in good agreement with
estimates made in other ways. The calculation of the masses of
these condensations leads to a still more interesting and significant
result. In every nebula for which the calculation can be made, the
calculated mass of a single condensation proves to be approximately
equal to the mass of the average star.

‘This gives, I believe, the key to the evolutionary process we have
been considering—we have been watching the creation of the stars.
In Plate 1, Figure 1 we saw the raw material—a gaseous mass of ex-
treme tenuity, already moulded, as a result of shrinkage and conse-
quent increase of rotation, to the stage at which disintegration is
ubout to commence. Further shrinkage takes place, and in Plate 1,
Figure 2, and Plate 2, Figure 1 we see the ejection of jets of gas
from which the future stars will in due course be made. In Plate
2, Figure 2, and Plate 3, Figure 1 individual stars are beginning to
form, although at present only as vague condensations in what is
still a continuous nebular mass. Finally, the outermost parts of
Plate 3, Figure 2, and Plate 4, Figure 1 show us the finished prod-
uct—separate masses, although still far more tenuous than ordinary
stars, starting off on their independent existences. Each of these
masses will go through the changes we have already briefly described.
It will contract, getting hotter in doing so, until it reaches a maxi-
mum temperature just as the gas laws are beginning to fail, after
which it cools and contracts into a dead dark mass.

The family of stars born out of a single nebula may be millions
in number. They may either mingle with the general mass of the
stars or, if the original nebula was sufficiently remote from the main
universe of stars, may form a separate colony by themselves. In
illustration of the former alternative, numbers of groups of stars
are known—e. g. the Pleiades, the stars of the Great Bear—in which
all the members have a common velocity and, generally speaking,
similar physical constitutions also. All the stars of any such group
are voyaging through space together, and have obviously done so
since they first came into being. The alternative possibility of a
family of stars forming a detached colony by themselves is perhaps
exemplified in the so-called “globular” star-clusters, such as the
well-known cluster in Hercules (pl. 5). These are globular only in
name, for Shapley has found that they are of an elliptical structure,
showing symmetry about a plane precisely as might be expected if
they were the final product of a rotating nebula.

ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 147

Probably we ought not to regard the two possibilities just men-
tioned as sharply cut alternatives. It is more likely that they repre-
sent the two extreme ends of a continuous chain of possible histories
for the family of stars born out of a single nebula. It seems quite
possible that what we describe as “the main mass of the stars” may
be nothing more than a collection of clusters of stars, each cluster
having originated out of a single nebula. The clusters are by now so
intermingled that it is difficult to look on them as distinct groups
of stars, although we can still find some evidence that this may be
the proper way of regarding them. In 1905 Kapteyn showed that
the stars in the neighborhood of the sun formed what he described
as two “star streams,” each stream moving with its own velocity in
space. Except that it begs the question as to the extent of these
streams in space, it would have been equally accurate to describe
them as forming two intermingled moving clusters. Shortly after,
Eddington and Halm, independently, found a third stream or moy-
ing cluster, constituted of the very hot stars which the astronomer
classifies as stars of types B and O. In this case we know the extent
of the cluster in space and also its approximate shape. According
to Charlier, it is shaped like a round biscuit lying parallel te the
Milky Way, its diameter being about 2.8 times its thickness. Any
cluster of stars having a common origin, whatever shape it may as-
sume at first, will be rapidly knocked out of shape when it begins to
intermingle with other stars. Dynamical theory shows that after
it has been knocked about ad infinitum in our universe of stars, such
a cluster ought to assume the shape of a round biscuit parallel to
the Milky Way, the ratio of its diameter to its thickness being about
2.5. This agrees sufficiently well with what is observed to suggest
that all the stars in this stream have a common origin, and the same
is true of many of the smaller known moving clusters, such as the
Ursa Major cluster already mentioned. Thus, although we can not
claim that anything is definitely proved, there is every justification
for thinking of the main mass of the stars as a jumble of inter-
mingled moving clusters, each cluster owing its existence to a sepa-
rate nebula. This possibility has no very direct bearing on the ques-
tion of the origin of our solar system; it has been mentioned merely
as rounding off our knowledge of what appears to be the main evolu-
tionary process of the stars.

In all its essentials except one, this evolutionary process is similar
to, and in its earlier stages almost identical with, that which Laplace,
in his famous nebular hypothesis, imagined as the origin of the
solar system. We have seen before our eyes the rotating and shrink-
ing nebula finally shedding matter from its equator; we have
watched the condensation of this matter into separate masses, and
148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

have finally witnessed the start of these detached masses on their
voyages into space, all precisely as pictured by Laplace.

The one essential difference is that of size. The evolutionary
process we have been watching occurs on a scale such as Laplace
never dreamed of. His primeval nebula was supposed to be of
about the size of Neptune’s orbit, a size represented on the scale I
used at the beginning of this lecture by a threepenny-bit. On this
same scale the nucleus alone of a good-sized spiral nebula, such as
those shown in Plate 3, Figure 2, and Plate 4, Figure 1, would be
about the size of the Albert Hall, while the arms would sprawl over
the whole of Hyde Park and Kensington. The pictures of these
nebule that you have before you would have to be enlarged to the
size of a whole country, or even possibly of a whole continent, before
a body the size of our earth became visible in them at all.

Although the parent nebule we have been considering are all in-
comparably greater than Laplace’s imaginary nebula, yet each tiny
condensation, as it starts off into space, is a gaseous nebula the mass
of which is just about equal to that imagined by Laplace and the
size of which is not perhaps very greatly different. If, then, this
younger generation of nebule meet with the same experiences in life
as their giant parents before them, we should not have to look far
for an explanation of the origin of the planets, and if the third gen-
eration again repeated the experience of their ancestors, the satellites
of the planets are also accounted for. But mathematical research
and observation agree in disposing of so simple an explanation of
the origin of the solar system. As we have seen, it is only because
the filaments in the spiral nebule are of such huge size that gravita-
tion is able to cause condensation in opposition to the expansive
tendency of gas pressure. A nebula of mass comparable to our sun
might go through the same life history as the bigger nebula until
matter began to be thrown off from its equator, but after this the dif-
ference of scale would begin to tell, and the subsequent course of
events would be widely different. The ejected matter could not
condense into filaments, still less into detached globules; it would
merely constitute a diffuse atmosphere surrounding the parent
nebula. As such a system shrank by the emission of radiation, the
constancy of angular momentum would, at first, merely demand that
more and more gas should be transferred from the center to the
atmosphere.

But mathematical investigation shows that in time, after the cen-
tral star had shrunk to a certain critical density, perhaps somewhere
about one-tenth of that of water, a cataclysmic period would ensue,
from which the mass would emerge as a binary star—two stars of
comparable masses revolving about one another nearly in contact
and in approximately circular orbits. This is a formation with
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 149

which the practical astronomer is very familiar. He finds that
a very large proportion—perhaps about one-half—of the stars in
the sky are binary, and he can detect an evolutionary sequence in
these binary stars. The sequence starts with the formation just
described in which the two constituent stars are almost in contact.
As it progresses the stars move ever farther and farther apart, while
the eccentricity of their orbits increases. Theory indicates that the
process of fission which has broken up the original star into two
constituents may repeat itself in either or both of these constituents,
so that the final product may be a “multiple” star of either three or
four constituents. Prof. H. N. Russell, investigating this question
theoretically, found that certain numerical relations must hold be-
tween the relative distances of the various constituents of a mul-
tiple star; he also showed that the predictions of theory are con-
firmed Se by observation.

So far, then, theory and observation have gone hand in hand.
We have need the evolution of astronomical matter through stages
of ever-increasing density, from the most tenuous of nebule to the
densest of multiple stars, and at almost every stage observation has
confirmed the predictions of theory. Not all astronomical matter
will traverse the whole length of this evolutionary course. The
driving force on this course is increase of rotation consequent on the
shrinkage produced by emission of radiation. When the shrinkage
has proceeded a certain length solidification sets in; the rotation can
increase now no further, and evolution, in the physical sense, stops.
The distance along the course to which any particular system pro-
ceeds depends in effect on the amount of rotation with which it was
originally endowed. Let a nebula begin its career with absolutely
no rotation and it will remain sperical in shape throughout its whole
career, ending merely as a cold non-radiating, but always spherical,
mass. Such a nebula never even gets away from the starting-post.
It is true that this is not a likely event, but for aught we know many
a nebula may freeze and die before reaching the critical configura-
tion (pl. 1, fig. 1) at which the birth of stars first commences.
Similarly many of the stars may become cold and so cease to develop
without ever attaining the stage at which binary systems are formed.
In the same way many binary systems must fail to develop into
multiple systems. Here again observation is with us; there are ten
times as many purely binary systems known as there are multiple
systems which have proceeded beyond the binary stage. Theory has
traced out for us the whole length of the evolutionary course, but
theory and observation agree that not many systems stay out the
whole course.

203972511
150 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

We now come to the crux of the whole question. Nowhere on this
course have we found our solar system or anything in the least degree
resembling it. If our sun had been unattended by planets we should
have had no difficulty in guessing its origin. It might reasonably
be supposed to have been born out of a nebula in the normal way,
but to have emerged with insufficient rotation to have carried it on
to the later stages of fission into a binary or a multiple system. It
might, in fact, be supposed to have had the same evolutionary career
as half of the stars in the sky. In support of the conjecture that
our sun had been born out of a nebula in the ordinary way, we could
note that its mass is about equal to what we calculate ought to be the
mass of a star born out of a nebula, and that it is, apart from its
planets, similar in every way to millions of other stars to which we
may ascribe a nebular origin. In support of the conjecture that it
had stopped short on its evolutionary course from want of adequate
rotation to carry it on further, we should merely have to note the
slowness of its present rotation. <A simple calculation shows that
the sun has only a small fraction of the amount of angular mo-
mentum requisite for fission. Even if we add the angular mo-
mentum of all the planets, as we ought if we suppose that these at
one time formed part of the sun, the result is the same—the whole
system can never have had more than a fraction of the angular mo-
mentum necessary for a rotational break-up into a binary star.

Thus the sun is a quite intelligible structure. The difficulty of
our problem is not the origin of the sun but the origin of the planets
and of their satellites.

Certain special types of astronomical structure have already been
mentioned as not falling into place on the main line of evolutionary
development. The particular examples chosen were the planetary
nebule, the Cepheid variables, and the long-period variables. The
question now arises as to whether we must add the solar system to the
list. The circumstance that certain structures do not find a place in
the evolutionary main line suggests that off this main line may be
branch lines on to which the development of a system may in cer-
tain circumstances be turned. This, indeed, is only what might be
anticipated. We should no more expect two stars to have precisely
the same experiences in their careers than we should expect it of two
humans. Our normal star has been supposed to develop in a uni-
verse of its own, where its angular momentum remained constant
and where it was in every way unmolested by its neighbors. The
mathematician finds it convenient to allot a whole infinite universe to
each star, but nature does not. Nevertheless, the conditions postu-
lated by the mathematician are nearer to the truth than is often the
case in his idealized problems. On the scale we have already used, on
which the sun was represented by a microscopic particle y5}55 inch
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 151

in diameter, the most gigantic of known giant stars may be repre-
sented by a pin head one-thirtieth of an inch in diameter. The pres-
ent spacing of the stars is such that on this scale there is less than
one star to a volume equal to the interior of St. Paul’s Cathedral.
Space then can not be said to be overcrowded, and although it is
possible that the stars may disturb one another as they move in their
courses, it is clear that any serious disturbance of one star by another
must be a rather exceptional event. Obviously we have been right
in regarding the evolution of a star entirely undisturbed by its
neighbors as the normal course of evolution, and we can now see
why the vast majority of stars follow this normal course.

To all appearances, the stars which have been sidetracked off this
normal course are extraordinarily few in number. The total number
of stars in the sky is about equal to the total pepulation of the earth;
the number of known exceptional systems would at most populate
one small town, although, of course, we can scarcely even conjecture
how many exceptional systems there may be which are still un-
known to us. There is no reason for supposing that the sidetracking
influence has in every case been a neighboring star, but the systems
known to be exceptional are sufficiently few to suggest that this may
have been the cause in a large proportion of cases.

The immediate question before us, however, is not that of the
exceptional systems in general, but of our own solar system. Was
it a neighboring star that threw it off the main line of evolutionary
development? Here, for the first time, observational astronomy
denies us any help. Not a single system is known outside our solar
system which resembles it in the least degree. The reason is not
that no such system exists, but that we could not see it if it did.
An astronomer on a distant star observing our system would see
Jupiter as the brightest object after our sun, but the ratio of their
luminosities would be as 300,000,000 to 1. Seen from our nearest
known neighbor in space, Proxima Centauri, the sun would appear
as a first magnitude star, and Jupiter as a star of magnitude 22.2,
the distance between them being at most four seconds of arc. A
star of magnitude 22.2 is still well beyond the range of our largest
telescopes, and would be doubly invisible if it had a first magnitude
star only four seconds away. We must wait for a very great in-
_ crease in the power of our telescopes before there will be any hope of
Seeing systems similar to our own in the sky, even if they exist
no further away from us than Proxima Centauri. Thus it is clear
that our discussion has now left the regions in which observation
can be called upon to make suggestions or to check our conclusions:
henceforth we have theory alcne to guide us.
| Let us start on our quest by noticing that our solar system has

quite clearly marked characteristics. It is no mere jumble of bodies
152 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

looking as though they had fallen together by accident—had it
presented this appearance the problem of its origin might reason-
ably be dismissed as hopeless. Not only has the principal system of
the sun and its planets got clearly marked characteristics, but also
these same characteristics reappear in the smaller systems formed
by Jupiter and Saturn, each with its family of satellites. Hach of
these small systems is, to all intents and purposes, a replica in minia-
ture of the solar system, so much so that no suggested origin for
one system can be regarded as satisfactory unless at the same time
it explains the origin of the other two. The principal features com-
mon to the three systems are, that the orbits in all three systems are
with few exceptions, all in or close to one plane, that these orbits
are all described in the same direction, and that the masses of the
secondaries, whether planets or satellites, are all small in compari-
son with those of the primaries around which they revolve. Thus
the sun has a mass equal to 1,047 times that of his greatest planet,
Jupiter, while Jupiter’s mass is about 11,000 times that of his most
massive satellite. The smallest disparity in mass is found in our
own Earth-Moon system with a mass ratio of 81 to 1. In systems
possessing many satellites (those of the Sun, Jupiter, and Saturn)
there is a general tendency for the masses to increase up to a maxi-
mum as we pass outward through the system, and then to decrease
to a minimum. Thus in the main system there is a regular progres-
sion through Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars to the maximum mass of
Jupiter, broken only by the anomalous position of Mars, while on
the descending side the progression through Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus,
Neptune fails in regularity only through Neptune being some few
per cent more massive than Uranus.

The main line of evolutionary progress has been supposed to be
that of a mass of shrinking, rotating matter—first gaseous, then liq-
uid, then solid—left to itself in space. Such a system must show
one very marked characteristic throughout its whole career, namely,
a plane of symmetry. In its earliest stage of all, when the system
is a mere chaos of independent molecules, the plane will coincide
with what mathematicians describe as the “invariable plane” of
the system. Later, when the mass has assumed the regular shape of
a rotating nebula, the plane is the equatorial plane of the nebula, the
plane in which the arms subsequently appear and in which the stellar
condensations start off in their orbits. The symmetry of spiral
nebule about their equatorial planes would of itself suggest strongly
that they have developed to their present formations as rotating
bodies practically undisturbed by external influences.

If our solar system had developed out of an undisturbed rotat-
ing mass, it, too, ought to exhibit a plane of symmetry. The orbits
of nearly all the planets and their satellites do, in actual fact, lie
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 153

very nearly in one plane, which, to this extent, is, of course, a plane
of symmetry. But the sun’s axis of rotation is not perpendicular
to this plane; the sun has its own plane of symmetry in its equator,
and this is inclined at an angle of 7° to the plane of orbits.

The existence of these two distinct planes is enough in itself to
suggest that our system has not developed simply out of an undis-
turbed rotating mass. Thus, in tracing our system back to its origin,
we naturally look at the effects to be expected from rotation plus
some external influence. To a first rough approximation, it is
natural to suppose that the plane of the sun’s equator records the
plane of rotation of the original system, while the plane of the plan-
etary orbits was in some way determined by the extraneous disturb-
ance.

Of all the interactions between two separate astronomical bodies,
gravitational attraction is likely to be by far the most potent. The
moon has been accused of exerting all kinds of influences on our
earth, as, for example, on its weather, on the destinies, the emotions,
and even on the sanity of its inhabitants; but the only influence
which survives scientific examination is gravitational attraction as
evidenced by the semidiurnal tides. It is true that a head-on colli-
sion between two astronomical bodies would produce more imme-
diately dramatic results than a mere tidal pull; but we shall not
consider such an event here. Head-on collisions must of necessity
be exceedingly rare; systems that experience them would undoubt-
edly be deflected from the main line of evolutionary progress on to
a branch line; but it does not seem likely that this branch line con-
tains systems like our own. As time does not permit the explora-
tion of all conceivable branch lines, let us turn at once to that which
seems most likely to reveal the origin of our system—the branch
line that diverges from the main line at the occurrence of a violent
tidal encounter.

On the earth, our moon raises tides the average height of which
at high tide is only a few feet. This height of high tide is only
about a ten-millionth part of the earth’s radius, a fraction which we
may designate as the tidal fraction. If the moon were ten times as
massive, the tidal fraction would be increased tenfold; if it were
brought to half its present distance, the tidal fraction would be in-
creased eightfold. If we agree to measure masses in terms of the
body on which the tide is raised as unity and to measure lengths
in terms of the radius of the same body, then the tidal fraction is
equal to the mass of the tide-generating body divided by the cube
of its distance, say M/R*. Using this formula, we find that our
nearest neighbor, Proxima Centauri, raises on the sun a tide of
quite infinitesimal magnitude; the tidal fraction is about 10-*, and
the actual height of tide is of the order of 10% em., or, say, one-
154 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

fiftieth of the radius of an electron. This single illustration will
show, and with some margin to spare, that under normal conditions
the tidal influence between neighboring stars is utterly insignificant.
For tidal forces to become important to cosmogony, conditions
must be abnormal.

Our sun happens at the present moment to have no especially near
neighbor; but it is fairly certain that at some time, in its wander-
ings through the stars, it must have passed stars within a much
less distance than that which now separates it from Proxima Cen-
tauri. The most trustworthy lines of evidence as to the earth’s age,
namely, those from geology and radioactivity, indicate an age of
from 800 to 1,100 million years. For precision, let us think of the
sun’s age as 1,000 million years. Let us imagine for the moment,
what is no doubt very far from the truth, that throughout all this
thousand million years the sun and all the stars have moved just
as they are moving now, with the same average velocities as now, and
keeping at the same average distance apart. Throughout this thou-
sand million years the distance of our sun from its nearest neighbor
will have been continually changing, and one star after another will,
of course, have taken up the réle of nearest neighbor. But there
must have been some one instant in this thousand million years at
which our sun was nearer than at any other instant to its nearest
neighbor. A calculation based on the theory of probability indicates
that this nearest distance is likely to have been of the order of
7X10** em., a distance which, although only a six-hundredth of that
which now separates us from Proxima Centauri, is still equal to
fifteen times the radius of Neptune’s orbit. Even if the sun had
filled the whole of Neptune’s orbit, the tidal fraction at this closest
encounter, on the supposition that the nearest star had a mass equal
to the sun, would only be equal to 1/(15)* or 1/3375, giving a height
of tide which is quite unimportant from the point of view of cos-
mogony. So long as things have been as they now are, tidal actions
between separate stars must have been quite devoid of cosmogonic
interest, except possibly in very special cases of quite exceptionally
close approaches.

It is, of course, possible that our sun was the victim of one of
those exceptionally close encounters. Nothing can be brought against
the supposition of such an event, except its a pricri improbability.
The result of such a close encounter might, as we shall see, be the
creation of a system in many ways resembling our solar system.

Our calculations of probabilities and improbabilities have, how-
ever, rested upon the admittedly errcneous assumption that stellar
conditions have been similar to the present ones for a period of
a thousand million years. On looking back through the past history
of the universe, we come to a time when conditions must have been
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS H55

very different from what they are now. We come to a time, which
we have already considered, when our sun had not yet assumed its
present stellar characteristics. It was a condensation in the arm of
a spiral nebula moving with thousands of similar condensations
towards a free career in space. Its density was enormously lower
than it now is, and its size correspondingly greater. It was also
much nearer to its neighbors than, in all probability, it has ever
been since. In this early stage of its existence, the tidal effects of
its neighbors may well have been enormous; we shall pass to exact
figures in a moment.

In general, the passage of one star past another merely raises a
tide which subsides as the tide-raising body recedes. Even when the
approach is so close that the height of the tide raised is greater than
the original radius of the star, the recession of the disturbing star
may result in the disturbed star relapsing merely to its original
spherical form. But there is a limit which must not be passed, and
if the disturbing body passes this limit, all hope of the star resuming
its original shape is lost. The distance of the limit depends pri-
marily on the mass of the disturber; to a lesser degree it depends on
the rotation, shape, and density-distribution of the primary star;
and to some extent it depends on the velocity of the two stars rela-
tive to one another. We shall get a tolerable idea of the march of
events if we suppose the primary star to be surrounded by an imag-
inary sphere the radius of which depends solely on the mass of the
disturbing star. If this mass is equal to the mass of the primary, the
radius of this imaginary sphere will be about 214 times the radius of
the primary; if the disturbing star has 8 times the mass of the pri-
mary, the radius of the imaginary sphere will be 414 times that of
the primary, and so on. So long as the center of the visiting star
remains outside the sphere, a tide is raised which recedes as the visit-
ing star disappears, but the moment the visiting star invades this
sphere an entirely new phenomenon appears.

As the approach of the disturber raises the tide to higher and
higher levels, the highest points of the tide move ever farther away
from the star’s center into regions where the gravitational attraction
of the star gets weaker and weaker. At the same time, of course, the
gravitational pull of the visiting star gets stronger and stronger.
Finally, just as the visiting star crosses the critical sphere, its gravi-
tational pull just balances that of the primary—it is this condition
that defines the critical sphere. If the visiting star further invades
this critical sphere, the particles at high tide are shot away from the
primary star, the resultant gravitational force on them now being
definitely toward the visiting star; they are, of course, immediately
replaced by others, which are shot off in turn, and so on. The total
effect is that a filament or jet of gas is shot out from the point of
156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

high tide. Each particle of this jet moves under the combined forces
of the primary and of the visiting star, and the problem of determin-
ing its orbit is a special case of the problem of three bodies, which
unfortunately is not soluble. But the general result is that the jet
undergoes various contortions while moving all the time in the plane
which contains the orbit of the visiting star.

If such a jet had been thrown off the sun simply by an increase of
rotation consequent on shrinkage, its gravitational attraction would,
as we have seen, be inadequate to resist the expansive effect of its own
gas pressure, and it would have been rapidly dissipated away into
space. In the present situation conditions are very different, the
essential difference being that, while shrinkage from loss of radiation
is a very slow process, tidal disruption may be a very rapid process.
The rate of a star’s rotation will alter but slightly in a thousand
years, whereas 10 years may suffice for a tide-raising body to come,
do its work, and go away again. The filament of gas set free by
increase of rotation would be of extreme tenuity; a filament set free
by a tidal cataclysm might easily be of sufficient substance for its
own gravitation to hold it together as a compact whole.

If gravitation is potent enough to do this, it will also be potent
enough to break up the filament into condensations, just as the fila-
ments of spiral nebule are broken up into condensations. But here
again an essential difference must be taken into account. The shrink-
age of a spiral nebula is a slow secular process. Year after year and
century after century the filament will be ejected without change of
character—the process may be compared to the paying out of a coil
of rope. But the tidal disruption of a star is a rapid, even cataclys-
mic event; within a few years the emission of the filament starts,
reaches a maximum, declines, and ends. There is no steady paying
out here; the process ought rather to be compared to the discharge of
a torpedo, or other body which is thickest in the middle and tapers
off at the two ends. When a filament of this shape breaks up into
condensations it will form no long chain of similar masses, but a
small number of unequal masses. It is natural to conjecture a priori
that large masses are likely to form out of the central portions where
matter is most plentiful, and smaller masses at the ends where matter
is scarce. Such a question can not, of course, be finally settled by a
priori conjectures, but in the present case an exact discussion of the
problem indicates that the a priori view is the right one, and suggests
that the comparative abundance of matter in the central part of the
filament may provide an explanation of the appearance of the more
massive planets, Jupiter and Saturn, near the center of the sequence
of planets.

Obviously, if a tidal cataclysm can explain the existence of the
planets, it can also, in general terms at least, explain the existence of
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 157

the satellites of these planets. For immediately after the birth of
any planet, say Jupiter, the original situation repeats itself in minia-
ture. Jupiter now plays the part originally assigned to the sun,
while either the wandering star or the sun itself, or possibly the com-
bination of the two, acts the part of the tide-raising disturber. Again
we get the emitted filament, again the formation of condensations,
and again, as the ultimate result, a sequence of detached bodies with
the most massive in the middle. Since Jupiter, the sun, and the dis-
turbing star all move in the same plane—namely, the plane of Jupi-
ter’s orbit—it follows that Jupiter’s satellites, when formed, ought
also to move in this plane, as in actual fact they are observed to do.

So long as we merely discuss the matter in general terms it looks
as though the process might go on for generation after generation,
each member of a family of satellites producing minor satellites to
circle round itself, and so on ad infinitum. Common sense suggests
that this can not go on forever; there must be a limit somewhere.
Exact calculation confirms the view of common-sense, with the dis-
concerting addition, that we are in danger of overstepping the limit
if we attempt to account for the whole of the satellites in the solar
system in the way just suggested.

I have already mentioned a mathematical formula which enables
us to calculate the masses of the bodies formed out of the condensa-
tions in the arms of spiral nebule. The same formula puts us in a
position to calculate the’ masses of the planets which ought to be
formed from the filament drawn out of the sun. Let us suppose that
when the tidal cataclysm took place the sun had a radius equal to
that of Neptune’s orbit, and therefore a mean density of 5.5107.
Let us suppose that at the middle parts of the ejected filament the
mean density was one-tenth of this, or 5.510%. Let us further
suppose that the temperature of the ejected matter corresponded to a

molecular velocity 410‘, this being about the molecular velocity of
hydrogen or oxygen at their ordinary boiling points. Then our

formula indicates that the masses of the planets formed out of the
middle parts of the filament ought to be about 10°° gm., a mass inter-
mediate between those of Jupiter and Saturn. This is satisfactory as
showing that there is no numerical difficulty in supposing Jupiter
and Saturn to have come into being in the way we have imagined.
If we like to accept the tidal theory of their birth, we can reverse
our calculation and can calculate from their present known masses
what must have been the density of the matter from which they were
formed.

Naturally an inverted calculation of this kind is not applicable
only to Jupiter and Saturn; if the tidal hypothesis is correct it must
be applicable to all the planets and to all their satellites. For ex-
ample, the first five satellites of Saturn all have masses of about

20397—25——_12
158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

5><10*° gm.; our calculation shows that if these satellites came into
being as gaseous condensations in a filament, the gas in this filament
must have been anything from one to a million times as dense as
lead. Such a conclusion is, of course, preposterous. The only proper
conclusion is that these satellites can not have originated as gaseous
condensations.

This conclusion is not surprising, or even unexpected. Even now
these satellites, on account of the smallness of their mass, are in-
capable of retaining a gaseous atmosphere, whence it follows that
they can never have existed in the gaseous state. They must have
been born either liquid or solid.

In this way we come upon the practical limitation to the possibil-
ity of endless generations of satellites being born. Primarily it is
that after a time the satellites would be too small for their gravita-
tion to hold them together. A brief reprieve from the operation of
this law is afforded by the possibility of the matter liquefying or
even solidifying before it scatters into space, and it is probably
owing to the operation of this reprieve that all the satellites of the
planets, and probably also the smaller planets themselves, owe their
existence.

What of our earth, which interests us above all other planets? Its
present mass is rather too small to have been born out of a purely
gaseous filament, but we must remember that if it were born gaseous
a large part of its mass might be immediately dissipated away into
space, the present earth representing only a remnant of a once much
more massive planet. This line of investigation leads nowhere. A
more promising line of attack is through a consideration of our satel-
lite, the moon. The more liquid a planet was at its birth the less
likely was it to be broken up tidally by the still gaseous sun, but, in
the event of this breaking up taking place, the ratio of mass between
satellite and primary would be much nearer to unity than in the case
of a wholly gaseous planet. Thus, as we pass from planets which
were wholly gaseous at birth to planets which were wholly liquid, we
ought to start from planets with large numbers of relatively small
satellites, and after passing through the boundary cases of planets
with a small number of relatively large satellites reach planets hav-
ing no satellites at all. This is precisely what we find in the solar
system. Leaving Jupiter and Saturn, each with their nine relatively
small satellites, we pass through Mars, with its two satellites, to the
earth, with one relatively very large satellite, and after this come to
Venus and Mercury, with no satellites at all. Proceeding in the
other direction from Jupiter and Saturn, we pass through Uranus,
with four small satellites, to Neptune, with one comparatively big
satellite. Looked at from this point of view, the earth-moon system
figures as the obvious boundary case between the planets which were
ORIGIN OF THE SOLAR SYSTEM—JEANS 159

originally liquid and those which were originally gaseous, the cor-
responding boundary case on the other half of the chain being Nep-
tune. Thus we can conjecture that Mercury and Venus were born
liquid or solid, that the earth and Neptune were born partly liquid
and partly gaseous, and that Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus were
born gaseous.

We have already noticed that Mars and Uranus both have masses
which are too small for their positions in the sequence of planets. If
the planets were born out of a filament of continuously varying
density, the mass of Mars at birth ought to have been intermediate
between that of the earth and that of Jupiter, and similarly the mass
of Uranus at birth ought to have been intermediate between that of
Neptune and that of Saturn. We have, however, just seen reasons
for conjecturing that the two anomalous planets, Mars and Uranus,
were the two smallest planets to be born in the gaseous state; they
would, therefore, be likely to lose more mass by dissipation of their
outer layers than any of the other planets. Let us introduce the sup-
position that Mars, and to a lesser degree Uranus, lost large parts of
their mass by dissipation into space; let us suppose that they are
mere fragments of what were originally much more massive planets,
then all anomalies disappear, and the pieces of the puzzle begin to
fit together in a very gratifying manner.

Nevertheless, and in spite of the high promise which the tidal
theory seems to hold out, it is far too early to claim that it can finally
explain the origin of our system. Its claim to consideration at pres-
ent is rather that, so far as I know, it provides the only theory of
that origin which is not open to obvious and insuperable objections.

THE ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER’

By Prof. Sir Ernest RuTHERFORD, D. Se.. LL. D., Ph. D., F. R. S.

It was in 1896 that this association last met in Liverpool, under
the presidency of the late Lord Lister, that great pioneer in antisep-
tic surgery, whose memory is held in affectionate remembrance by
all nations. His address, which dealt mainky with the history of
the application of antiseptic methods to surgery and its connection
with the work of Pasteur, that prince of experimenters, whose birth
has been so fittingly celebrated this year, gave us in a sense a com-
pleted page of brilliant scientific history. At the same time, in his
opening remarks, Lister emphasized the importance of the discovery
by Réntgen of a new type of radiation, the X rays, which we now
see marked the beginning of a new and fruitful era in another
branch of the science.

The visit to your city in 1896 was for me a memorable occasion, for
it was here that I first attended a meeting of this association, and
hear that I read my first scientific paper. But of much more impor-
tance, it was here that I benefited by the opportunity, which these
gatherings so amply afford, of meeting for the first time many of the
distinguished scientific men of this country and the foreign repre-
sentatives of science who were the guests of this city on that oc-
casion. The year 1896 has always seemed to me a memorable one for
other reasons, for on looking back with some sense of perspective
we can not fail to recognize that the last Liverpool meeting marked
the beginning of what has been aptly termed the heroic age of phys-
ical science. Never before in the history of physics has there been
witnessed such a period of intense activity when discoveries of
fundamental importance have followed one another with such
bewildering rapidity.

The discovery of X rays by Réntgen had been published to the
world in 1895, while the discovery of the radioactivity of uranium
by Becquerel was announced early in 1896. Even the most imagina-
tive of our scientific men could never have dreamed at that time of
the extension of our knowledge of the structure of matter that was to

162 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

develop from these two fundamental discoveries, but in the records
of the Liverpool meeting we see the dawning recognition of the pos-
sible consequences of the discovery of X rays, not only in their ap-
plication to medicine and surgery, but as a new and powerful agent
for attacking some of the fundamental problems of physics. The
address of Prof. J. J. Thomson, president of Section A, was devoted
mainly to a discussion of the nature of the X rays, and the remark-
able properties induced in gases by the passage of X rays through
them—the beginning of a new and fruitful branch of study.

In applied physics, too, this year marked the beginning of another
advance. In the discussion of a paper which I had the honor to
read, on a new magnetic detector of electrical waves, the late Sir
William Preece told the meeting of the successful transmission of
signals for a few hundred yards by electrical waves which had been
made in England by a young Italian, G. Marconi. The first public
demonstration of signaling for short distances by electric waves
had been given by Sir Oliver Lodge at the Oxford meeting of this
association in 1894. It is startling to recall the rapidity of the
development from such small beginnings of the new method of
wireless intercommunication over the greatest terrestrial distances.
In the last few years this has been followed by the even more rapid
growth of the allied subject of radiotelephony as a practical means
of broadcasting speech and music to distances only limited by the
power of the transmitting station. The rapidity of these technical
advances is an illustration of the close interconnection that must
exist between pure and applied science if rapid and sure progress
is to be made. The electrical engineer has been able to base his
technical developments on the solid foundation of Maxwell’s electro-
magnetic theory and its complete verification by the researches of
Hertz, and also by the experiments of Sir Oliver Lodge in this uni-
versity—a verification which was completed long before the prac-
tical possibilities of this new method of signaling had been generally
recognized. The later advances in radiotelegraphy and radiotele-
phony have largely depended on the application of the results of
fundamental researches on the properties of electrons, as illustrated
in the use of the thermionic valve or electron tube which has proved
such an invaluable agent both for the transmission and reception of
electric waves.

It is of great interest to note that the benefits of this union of pure
and applied research have not been one-sided. If the fundamental
researches of the workers in pure science supply the foundations on
which the applications are surely built, the successful practical
application in turn quickens and extends the interest of the investi-
gator in the fundamental problem, while the development of new
methods and appliances required for technical purposes often pro-
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—-RUTHERFORD 163

vides the investigator with means of attacking still more difficult
questions. This important reaction between pure and applied
science can be illustrated in many branches of knowledge. It is
particularly manifest in the industrial development of X-ray radio-
graphy for therapeutic and industrial purposes, where the develop-
ment on a large scale of special X-ray tubes and improved methods
of excitation has given the physicist much more efficient tools to carry
out his researches on the nature of the rays themselves and on the
structure of the atom. In this age no one can draw any sharp line
of distinction between the importance of so-called pure and applied
research. Both are equally essential to progress, and we can not
but recognize that without flourishing schools of research on funda-
mental matters in our universities and scientific institutions technical
research must tend to wither. Fortunately there is little need to
labor this point at the moment, for the importance of a training in
pure research has been generally recognized. The Department of
Scientific and Industrial Research has made a generous provision
of grants to train qualified young men of promise in research
methods in our scientific institutions, and has aided special funda-
mental researches which are clearly beyond the capacity of a labora-
tory to finance from its own funds. Those who have the responsi-
bility of administering the grants in aid of research, both for pure
and applied science, will need all their wisdom and experience to
make a wise allocation of funds to secure the maximum of results
for the minimum of expenditure. It is fatally easy to spend much
money in direct frontal attack on some technical problem of im-
portance when the solution may depend on some addition to know-
ledge which can be gained in some other field of scientific inquiry
possibly at a trifling cost. It is not in any sense my purpose to
eriticize those bodies which administer funds for fostering pure and
applied research, but to emphasize how difficult it is to strike the
correct balance between the expenditure on pure and applied science
in order to achieve the best results in the long run.

It is my intention this evening to refer very briefly to some of
the main features of that great advance in knowledge of the nature
of electricity and matter which is one of the salient features of the
interval since the last meeting of this association in Liverpool.

In order to view the extensive territory which has been conquered
by science in this interval, it is desirable to give a brief summary
of the state of knowledge of the constitution of matter at the be-
ginning of this epoch. Ever since its announcement by Dalton the
atomic theory has steadily gained ground, and formed the philo-
sophic basis for the explanation of the facts of chemical combina-
tion. In the early stages of its application to physics and chemis-
try it was unnecessary to have any detailed knowledge of the di-
164 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

mensions or structure of the atom. It was only necessary to assume
that the atoms acted as individual units, and to know the relative
masses of the atoms of the different elements. In the next stage,
for example, in the kinetic theory of gases, it was possible to explain
the main properties of gases by supposing that the atoms of the
gas acted as minute perfectly elastic spheres. During this period,
by the application of a variety of methods, many of which were due
to Lord Kelvin, rough estimates had been obtained of the absolute
dimensions and mass of the atoms. These brought out the minute
size and mass of the atom and the enormous number of atoms neces-
sary to produce a detectable effect in any kind of measurement.
From this arose the general idea that the atomic theory must of
necessity forever remain unverifiable by direct experiment, and for
this reason it was suggested by one school of thought that the
atomic theory should be banished from the teaching of chemistry,
and that the law of multiple proportions should be accepted as the
ultimate fact of chemistry.

While the vaguest ideas were held as to the possible structure of
atoms, there was a general belief among the more philosophically
minded that the atoms of the elements could not be regarded as
simple unconnected units. The periodic variations of the properties
of the elements brought out by Mendeleeff were only explicable if
atoms were similar structures in some way constructed of similar
material. We shall see that the problem of the constitution of
atoms is intimately connected with our conception of the nature of
electricity. The wonderful success of the electromagnetic theory
had concentrated attention on the medium or ether surrounding the
conductor of electricity, and little attention had been paid to the ac-
tual carriers of the electric current itself. At the same time the
idea was generally gaining ground that an explanation of the re-
sults of Faraday’s experiments on electrolysis was only possible on
the assumption that electricity, like matter, was atomic in nature.

The name “electron” had even been given to this fundamental
unit by Johnstone Stoney, and its magnitude roughly estimated,
but the full recognition of the significance and importance of this
conception belongs to the new epoch.

For the clarifying of these somewhat vague ideas, the proof in
1897 of the independent existence of the electron as a mobile elec-
trified unit, of mass minute compared with that of the lightest atom,
was of extraordinary importance. It was soon seen that the elec-
tron must be a constituent of all the atoms of matter, and that
optical spectra had their origin in their vibrations. The discovery
of the electron and the proof of its liberation by a variety of
methods from all the atoms of matter was of the utmost signifi-
cance, for it strengthened the view that the electron was probably
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 165

the common unit in the structure of atoms which the periodic va-
riation of the chemical properties had indicated. It gave for the
first time some hope of the success of an attack on that most funda-
mental of all problems—the detailed structure of the atom. In
the early development of this subject science owes much to the work
of Sir J. J. Thomson, both for the boldness of his ideas and for
his ingenuity in developing methods for estimating the number of
electrons in the atom, and of probing its structure. He early took
the view that the atom must be an electrical structure, held together
by electrical forces, and showed in a general way lines of possible
explanation of the variation of physical and chemical properties
of the elements, exemplified in the periodic law.

In the meantime our whole conception of the atom and of the
magnitude of the forces which held it together was revolutionized
by the study of radioactivity. The discovery of radium was a great
step in advance, for it provided the experimenter with powerful
sources of radiation specially suitable for examining the nature of
the characteristic radiations which are emitted by the radioactive
bodies in general. It was soon shown that the atoms of radioactive
matter were undergoing spontaneous transformation, and that the
characteristic radiations emitted, viz, the a, 6, and y rays, were an
accompaniment and consequence of these atomic explosions. The
wonderful succession of changes that occur in uranium, more than
30 in number, was soon disclosed and simply interpreted on the
transformation theory. The radioactive elements provide us for
the first time with a glimpse into Nature’s laboratory and allow us
to watch and study but not control the changes that have their ori-
gin in the heart of the radioactive atoms. These atomic explo-
sions involve energies which are gigantic compared with those in-
volved in any ordinary physical or chemical process. In the ma-
jority of cases an @ particle is expelled at high speed, but in others
a swift electron is ejected often accompanied by a y ray, which is
a very penetrating X ray of high frequency. The proof that the «
particle is a charged helium atom for the first time disclosed the im-
portance of helium as one of the units in the structure of the radio-
active atoms, and probably also in that of the atoms of most of the
ordinary elements. Not only then have the radioactive elements had
the greatest direct influence on natural philosophy, but in subsidiary
ways they have provided us with experimental methods of almost
equal importance. The use of « particles as projectiles with which
to explore the interior of the atom has definitely exhibited its nu-
clear structure, has led to artificial disintegration of certain light
atoms, and promises to yield more information yet as to the actual
structure of the nucleus itself.
166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

The influence of radioactivity has also extended to yet another field
of study of fascinating interest. We have seen that the first rough
estimates of the size and mass of the atom gave little hope that we
could detect the effect of a single atom. The discovery that the radio-
active bodies expel actual charged atoms of helium with enormous
energy altered this aspect of the problem. The energy associated
with a single « particle is so great that it can readily be detected by
a variety of methods. Each «@ particle, as Sir William Crookes first
showed, produces a flash of light easily visible in a dark room when
it falls on a screen coated with crystals of zine sulphide. This scin-
tillation method of counting individual particles has proved invalu-
able in many researches, for it gives us a method of unequaled deli-
cacy for studying the effects of single atoms. The a particle can also
be detected electrically or photographically, but the most powerful
and beautiful of all methods is that perfected by Mr. C. T. R. Wilson
for observing the track through a gas not only of an a particle but
of any type of penetrating radiation which produces ions or of elec-
trified particles along its path. The method is comparatively simple,
depending on the fact, first discovered by him, that if a gas saturated
with moisture is suddenly cooled each of the ions produced by the
radiation becomes the nucleus of a visible drop of water. The water-
drops along the track of the « particle are clearly visible to the eye,
and can be recorded photographically. These beautiful photographs
of the effect produced by single atoms or single electrons appeal, I
think, greatly to all scientific men. They not only afford convincing
evidence of the discrete nature of these particles, but give us new
courage and confidence that the scientific methods of experiment
and deduction are to be relied upon in this field of inquiry; for
many of the essential points brought out so clearly and concretely in
these photographs were correctly deduced long before such confirma-
tory photographs were available. At the same time, a minute study
of the detail disclosed in these photographs gives us most valuable
information and new clues on many recondite effects produced by the
passage through matter of these flying projectiles and penetrating
radiations.

In the meantime a number of new methods had been devised to fix
with some accuracy the mass of the individual atom and the number
in any given quantity of matter. The concordant results obtained by
widely different physical principles gave great confidence in the
correctness of the atomic idea of matter. The method found capable
of most accuracy depends on the definite proof of the atomic nature
of electricity and the exact valuation of this fundamental unit of
charge. We have seen that it was early surmised that electricity was
atomic in nature. This view was confirmed and extended by a study
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 167

of the charges carried by electrons, « particles, and the ions produced
in gases by X rays and the rays from radioactive matter. It wa
first shown by Townsend that the positive or negative charge carried
by an ion in gases was invariably equal to the charge carried by the
hydrogen ion in the electrolysis of water, which we have seen was
assumed, and assumed correctly, by Johnstone Stoney to be the
fundamental unit of charge. Various methods were devised to
measure the magnitude of this fundamental unit; the best known and
most accurate is that used by Millikan, which depends on comparing
the pull of an electric field on a charged droplet of oil or mercury
with the weight of the drop. His experiments gave a most convinc-
ing proof of the correctness’ of the electronic theory, and gave a
measure of this unit, the most fundamental of all physical units,
with an accuracy of about one in a thousand. Knowing this value,
we can by the aid of electrochemical data easily deduce the mass of
the individual atoms and the number of molecules in a cubic centi-
meter of any gas with an accuracy of possibly one in a thousand,
but certainly better than one in a hundred. When we consider the
minuteness of the unit of electricity and of the mass of the atom this
experimental achievement is one of the most notable even in an era of
great advances.

The idea of the atomic nature of electricity is very closely connected
with the attack on the problem of the structure of the atom. If the
atom is an electrical structure it can only contain an integral number
of charged units, and, since it is ordinarily neutral, the number of
units of positive charge must equal the number of negative. One
of the main difficulties in this problem has been the uncertainty as to
the relative part played by positive and negative electricity in the
structure of the atom. We know that the electron has a negative
charge of one fundamental unit, while the charged hydrogen atom,
whether in electrolysis or in the electric discharge, has a charge of
one positive unit. But the mass of the electron is only 1/1840 of the
mass of the hydrogen atom, and though an extensive search has been
made, not the slightest evidence has been found of the existence of
a positive electron of small mass like the negative. In no case has
a positive charge been found associated with a mass less than that
of the charged atom of hydrogen. This difference between positive
and negative electricity is at first sight very surprising, but the
deeper we pursue our inquiries the more this fundamental difference
between the units of positive and negative electricity is emphasized.
In fact, as we shall see later, the atoms are quite unsymmetrical struc-
tures with regard to the positive and negative units contained in
them, and indeed it seems certain that if there were not this difference
in mass between the two units, matter, as we know it, could not exist.
168 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

It is natural to inquire what explanation can be given of this
striking difference in mass of the two units. I think all scientific men
are convinced that the small mass of the negative electron is to be
entirely associated with the energy of its electrical structure, so that
the electron may be regarded as a disembodied atom of negative
electricity. We know that an electron in motion, in addition to pos-
sessing an electric field, also generates a magnetic field around it,
and energy in the electromagnetic form is stored in the medium and
moves with it. This gives the electron an apparent or electrical
mass, which, while nearly constant for slow speeds, increases rapidly
as its velocity approaches that of light. This increase of mass is in
good accord with calculation, whether based on the ordinary electrical
theory or on the theory of relativity. Now we know that the hydro-
gen atom is the lightest of all atoms, and is presumably the simplest
in structure, and that the charged hydrogen atom, which we shall see
is to be regarded as the hydrogen nucleus, carries a unit positive
charge. It is thus natural to suppose that the hydrogen nucleus is the
atom of positive electricity, or positive electron, analogous to the
negative electron, but differing from it in mass. Electrical theory
shows that the mass of a given charge of electricity increases with
the concentration, and the greater mass of the hydrogen nucleus
would be accounted for if its size were much smaller than that of
the electron. Such a conclusion is supported by evidence obtained
from the study of the close collisions of « particles with hydrogen
nuclei. It is found that the hydrogen nucleus must be of minute size,
of radius less than the electron, which is usually supposed to be about
10-2 ems.; also the experimental evidence is not inconsistent with
the view that the hydrogen nucleus may actually be much smaller
than the electron. While the greater mass of the positive atom of
electricity may be explained in this way, we are still left with the
enigma why the two units of electricity should differ so markedly in
this respect. In the present state of our knowledge it does not seem
possible to push this inquiry further or to discuss the problem of the
relation of these two units.

We shall see that there is the strongest evidence that the atoms
of matter are built up of these two electrical units, viz, the electron
and the hydrogen nucleus or proton, as it is usually called when it
forms part of the structure of any atom. It is probable that these
two are the fundamental and indivisible units which build up our
universe, but we may reserve in our mind the possibility that further
inquiry may some day show that these units are complex, and divisible
into even more fundamental entities. On the views we have outlined,
the mass of the atom is the sum of the electrical masses of the indi-
vidual charged units composing its structure, and there is no need to
assume that any other kind of mass exists. At the same time, it is
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 169

to be borne in mind that the actual mass of an atom may be somewhat
less than the sum of the masses of component positive and negative
electrons when in the free state. On account of the very close
proximity of the charged units in the nucleus of an atom, and the
consequent disturbance of the electric and magnetic field surrounding
them, such a decrease of mass is to be anticipated on general theo-
retical grounds.

We must now look back again to the earlier stages of the present
epoch in order to trace the development of our ideas on the detailed
structure of the atom. That electrons as such were important con-
stituents was clear by 1900, but little real progress followed until the
part played by the positive charges was made clear. New light was
thrown on this subject by examining the deviation of « particles
when they passed through the atoms of matter. It was found that
occasionally a swift « particle was deflected from its rectilinear path
through more than a right angle by an encounter with a single
atom. In such a collision the laws of dynamics ordinarily apply,
and the relation between the velocities of the colliding atoms before
and after collision are exactly the same as if the two colliding par-
ticles are regarded as perfectly elastic spheres of minute dimensions.
It must, however, be borne in mind that in these atomic collisions
there is no question of mechanical impacts such as we observe with
ordinary matter. The reaction between the two particles occurs
through the intermediary of the powerful electric fields that sur-
round them. Beautiful photographs illustrating the accuracy of
these laws of collision between an a particle and an atom have been
obtained by Messrs. Wilson, Blackett, and others, while Mr. Wilson
has recently obtained many striking illustrations of collisions be-
tween two electrons. Remembering the great kinetic energy of the
a particle, its deflection through a large angle in a single atomic
encounter shows clearly that very intense deflecting forces exist
inside the atom. It seemed clear that electric fields of the required
magnitude could be obtained only if the main charge of the atom
were concentrated in a minute nucleus. From this arose the con-
ception of the nuclear atom, now so well known, in which the heart
of the atom is supposed to consist of a minute but massive nucleus,
carrying a positive charge of electricity, and surrounded at a dis-
tance by the requisite number of electrons to form a neutral atom.

A detailed study of the scattering of « particles at different angles
by Geiger and Marsden showed that the results were in close accord
with this theory, and that the intense forces near the nucleus
varied according to the ordinary inverse square law. In addition,
the experiments allowed us to fix an upper limit for the dimensions
of the nucleus. For a heavy atom like that of gold the radius of
the nucleus, if supposed to be spherical, was less than one thousandth
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of the radius of the complete atom surrounded by its electrons, and
certainly less than 4 10°" cms. All the atoms were found to show
this nuclear structure, and an approximate estimate was made of the
nuclear charge of different atoms. This type of nuclear atom, based
on direct experimental evidence, possesses some very simple proper-
ties. It is obvious that the number of units of resultant positive
charge in the nucleus fixes the number of the outer planetary elec-
trons in the neutral atom. In addition, since these outer electrons
are in some way held in equilibrium by the attractive forces from
the nucleus, and, since we are confident from general physical and
chemical evidence that all atoms of any one element are identical
in their external structure, it is clear that their arrangement and
motion must be governed entirely by the magnitude of the nuclear
charge. Since the ordinary chemical and physical properties are
to be ascribed mainly to the configuration and motion of the outer
electrons, it follows that the properties of an atom are defined by a
whole number representing its nuclear charge. It thus becomes of
great importance to determine the value of this nuclear charge for
the atoms of all the elements.
Data obtained from the scattering of « particles, and also from
the scattering of X rays by light elements, indicated that the nuclear
charge of an element was numerically equal to about half the atomic
weight in terms of hydrogen. It was fairly clear from general evi-
dence that the hydrogen nucleus had a charge one, and the helium
nucleus (the « particle) a charge two. At this stage another dis-
covery of great importance provided a powerful method of attack
on this problem. The investigation by Laue on the diffraction of
X rays by crystals had shown definitely that X rays were electro-
magnetic waves of much shorter wave-length than light, and the
experiments of Sir William Bragg and W. L. Bragg had provided
simple methods for studying the spectra of a beam of X rays. It
was found that the spectrum in general shows a continuous back-
ground on which is superimposed a spectrum of bright lines. At
this stage H. G. J. Moseley began a research with the intention of
deciding whether the properties of an element depended on its
nuclear charge rather than on its atomic weight as ordinarily sup-
posed. For this purpose the X-ray spectra emitted by a number
of elements were examined and found to be all similar in type.
The frequency of a given line was found to vary very nearly as
the square of a whole number which varied by unity in passing
from one element to the next. Moseley identified this whole num-
ber with the atomic or ordinal number of the elements when ar-
ranged in increasing order of atomic weight, allowance being made
for the known anomalies in the periodic table and for certain gaps
corresponding to possible but missing elements. He concluded that
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 171

the atomic number of an element was a measure of its nuclear
charge, and the correctness of this deduction has been recently veri-
fied by Chadwick by direct experiments on the scattering of «2
particles. Moseley’s discovery is of fundamental importance, for it
not only fixes the number of electrons in all the atoms, but shows
conclusively that the properties of an atom, as had been surmised,
are determined not by its atomic weight but by its nuclear charge.
A relation of unexpected simplicity is thus found to hold between
the elements. No one could have anticipated that with few excep-
tions all atomic numbers between hydrogen 1 and uranium 92 would
correspond to known elements. The great power of Moseley’s law
in fixing the atomic number of an element is well illustrated by the
recent discovery by Coster and Hevesy in Copenhagen of the miss-
ing element of atomic number 72, which they have named
“hafnium.”

Once the salient features of the structure of atoms have been fixed
and the number of electrons known, the further study of the struc-
ture of the atom falls naturally into two great divisions: One, the
arrangement of the outer electrons which controls the main physical
and chemical properties of an element, and the other the structure
of the nucleus on which the mass and radioactivity of the atom de-
pends. On the nuclear theory the hydrogen atom is of extreme sim-
plicity, consisting of a singly-charged positive nucleus with only
one attendant electron. The position and motions of the single elec-
tron must account for the complicated optical spectrum, and what-
ever physical and chemical properties are to be attributed to the
hydrogen atom. The first definite attack on the problem of the
electronic structure of the atom was made by Niels Bohr. He saw
clearly that, if this simple constitution was assumed, it is impossible
to account for the spectrum of hydrogen on the classical electrical
theories, but that a radical departure from existing views was neces-
sary. For this purpose he applied to the atom the essential ideas of
the quantum theory which had been developed by Planck for other
purposes, and had been found of great service in explaining many
fundamental difficulties in other branches of science. On Planck’s
theory radiation is emitted in definite units or quanta, in which the
energy E of a radiation is equal to hy where y is the frequency of
the radiation measured by the ordinary methods and h a universal
constant. This quantum of radiation is not a definite fixed unit like
the atom of electricity, for its magnitude depends on the frequency
of the radiation. For example, the energy of a quantum is small for
visible light, but becomes large for radiation of high frequency cor-
responding to the X rays or the y rays from radium.

Time does not allow me to discuss the underlying meaning of the
quantum theory or the difficulties connected with it. Certain aspects
172 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of the difficulties were discussed in the presidential address before
this association by Sir Oliver Lodge at Birmingham in 1913. It
suffices to say that this theory has proved of great value in several
branches of science, and is supported by a large mass of direct ex-
perimental evidence.

In applying the quantum theory to the structure of the hydrogen
atom Bohr supposed that the single electron could move in a number
of stable orbits, controlled by the attractive force of the nucleus,
without losing energy by radiation. The position and character of
these orbits were defined by certain quantum relations depending
on one or more whole numbers. It was assumed that radiation was
only emitted when the electron for some reason was transferred
from one stable orbit to another of lower energy. In such a case it
was supposed that a homogeneous radiation was emitted of fre-
quency v determined by the quantum relation E=Av where E was
the difference of the energy of the electron in the two orbits. Some
of these possible orbits are circular, others elliptical, with the nucleus
as a focus, while if the change of mass of the electron with velocity
is taken into account the orbits, as Sommerfeld showed, depend on
two quantum numbers, and are not closed, but consist of a nearly
elliptical orbit slowly rotating round the nucleus. In this way it is
possible not only to account for the series relations between the
bright lines of the hydrogen spectrum, but also to explain the fine
structure of the lines and the very complicated changes observed
when the radiating atoms are exposed in a strong magnetic or elec-
tric field. Under ordinary conditions the electron in the hydrogen
atom rotates in a circular orbit close to the nucleus, but if the atoms
are excited by an electric discharge or other suitable method, the
electron may be displaced and occupy any one of the stable positions
specified by the theory. In a radiating gas giving the complete
hydrogen spectrum there will be present many different kinds of
hydrogen atoms, in each of which the electron describes one of the
possible orbits specified by the theory. On this view it is seen that
the variety of modes of vibration of the hydrogen atom is ascribed, not
to complexity of the structure of the atom, but to the variety of stable
orbits which an electron may occupy relative to the nucleus. This
novel theory of the origin of spectra has been developed so as to
apply not only to hydrogen but to all the elements, and has been
instrumental in throwing a flood of light on the relations and origin
of their spectra, both X ray and optical. The information thus
gained has been applied by Bohr to determine the distribution of
the electrons round the nucleus of any atom. The problem is ob-
viously much less complicated for hydrogen than for a heavy atom,
where each of the large number of electrons present acts on the
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 173

other, and where the orbits described are much more intricate than
the orbit of the single electron in hydrogen. Notwithstanding the
great difficulties of such a complicated system of electrons in motion,
it has been possible to fix the quantum numbers that characterize the
motion of each electron, and to form at any rate a rough idea of the
character of the orbit.

These planetary electrons divide themselves up into groups, accord-
ing as their orbits are characterized by one or more equal quantum
numbers. Without going into detail a few examples may be given
to illustrate the conclusions which have been reached. As we have
seen, the first element hydrogen has a nuclear charge off and sf
electron; the second, helium, has a charge 2 and 2 electrons, moving
in coupled orbits on the detailed nature of which there is still some
uncertainty. These two electrons form a definite group, known as
the K group, which is common to all the elements except hydrogen.
For increasing nuclear charge the K group of electrons retain their
characteristics, but move with increasing speed, and approach closer
to the nucleus. As we pass from helium of atomic number 2 to
neon, number 10, a new group of electrons is added consisting of
two subgroups, each of four electrons, together called the L group.
This L group appears in all atoms of higher atomic number, and,
as in the case of the K group, the speed of motion of the electrons
increases, and the size of their orbits diminishes with the atomic
number. When once the L group has been completed a new and still
more complicated M group of electrons begins forming outside it,
and a similar process goes on until uranium, which has the highest
atomic number, is reached.

It may be of interest to try to visualize the conception of the
atom we have so far reached by taking for illustration the heaviest
atom, uranium. At the center of the atom is a minute nucleus sur-
rounded by a swirling group of 92 electrons, all in motion in definite
orbits and occupying but by no means filling a volume very large
compared with that of the nucleus. Some of the electrons describe
nearly circular orbits round the nucleus; others, orbits of a more
elliptical shape whose axes rotate rapidly round the nucleus. The
motion of the electrons in the different groups is not necessarily
confined to a definite region of the atom, but the electrons of one
group may penetrate deeply into the region mainly occupied by
another group, thus giving a type of interconnection or coupling
between the various groups. The maximum speed of any electron
depends on the closeness of the approach to the nucleus, but the
outermost electron will have a minimum speed of more than 1,000
kilometers per second, while the innermost K electrons have an
average speed of more than 150,000 kilometers per second, or half the
174 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

speed of light. When we visualize the extraordinary complexity
of the electronic system we may be surprised that it has been pos-
sible to find any order in the apparent medley of motions.

In reaching these conclusions, which we owe largely to Professor
Bohr and his coworkers, every available kind of data about the
different atoms has been taken into consideration. A study of the
X-ray spectra, in particular, affords information of great value as
to the arrangement of the various groups in the atom, while the
optical spectrum and general chemical properties are of great im-
portance in deciding the arrangements of the superticial electrons.
While the solution of the grouping of the electrons proposed by
Bohr has been assisted by considerations of this kind, it is not em-
pirical in character, but has been largely based on general theoretical
considerations of the orbits of electrons that are physically possible
on the generalized quantum theory. The real problem involved may
be illustrated in the following way. Suppose the gold nucleus be in
some way stripped of its attendant 79 electrons and that the atom
is reconstituted by the successive addition of electrons one by one.
According to Bohr the atom will be reorganized in one way only,
and one group after another will successively form and be filled
up in the manner outlined. The nucleus atom has often been likened
to a solar system where the sun corresponds to the nucleus and the
planets to the electrons. The analogy, however, must not be pressed
too far. Suppose, for example, we imagined that some large and
swift celestial visitor traverses and escapes from our solar system
without any catastrophe to itself or the planets. There will in-
evitably result permanent changes in the lengths of the month and
year, and our system will never return to its original state. Con-
trast this with the effect of shooting an electron or a particle through
the electronic structure of the atom. The motion of many of the
electrons will be disturbed by its passage, and in special cases an
electron may be removed from its orbit and hurled out of its atomic
system. In a short time another electron will fall into the vacant
place from one of the outer groups, and this vacant place in tur
will be filled up, and so on until the atom is again reorganized. In
all cases the final state of the electronic system is the same as in the
beginning. This illustration also serves to indicate the origin of
the X rays excited in the atom, for these arise in the process of
reformation of an atom from which an electron has been ejected,
and the radiation of highest frequency arises when the electron is
removed from the K group.

It is possibly too soon to express a final opinion on the accuracy of
this theory which defines the outer structure of the atom, but there
can be no doubt that it constitutes a great advance. Not only does
it offer a general explanation of the optical and X-ray spectra of the
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD “TS

atom but it accounts in detail for many of the most characteristic
features of the periodic law of Mendeleeff. It gives us for the first
time a clear idea of the reason for the appearance in the family of
elements of groups of consecutive elements with similar chemical
properties, such as the groups analogous to the iron group and the
unique group of rare earths. The theory of Bohr, like all living
theories, has not only correlated a multitude of isolated facts known
about the atom, but has shown its power to predict new relations
which can be verified by experiment. For example, the theory
predicted the relations which must subsist between the Rydberg
constants of the arc and spark spectra, and generally between all
the successive optical spectra of an element, a prediction so strik-
ingly confirmed by Paschen’s work on the spectrum of doubly
ionized aluminium and Fowler’s work on the spectrum of trebly
ionized silicon. Finally it predicted with such great confidence the
chemical properties of the missing element, number 72, that it gave
the necessary incentive for its recent discovery.

While the progress of our knowledge of-the outer structure of
atoms has been much more rapid than could have been anticipated,
we clearly see that only a beginning has been made on this great
problem, and that an enormous amount of work is still required
before we can hope to form anything like a complete picture even
of the outer structure of the atom. We may be confident that the
main features of the structure are clear, but in a problem of such
great complexity progress in detail must of necessity be difficult
and slow.

We have not so far referred to the very difficult question of the
explanation on this theory of the chemical combination of atoms.
In fact, as yet the theory has hardly concerned itself with mole-
cular structure. On the chemical side, however, certain advances
have already been made, notably by G. N. Lewis, Kossel, and Lang-
muir, in the interpretation of the chemical evidence by the idea of
shared electrons, which play a part in the electronic structure of
two combined atoms. There can be little doubt that the next decade
will see an intensified attack by physicists and chemists on this very
important but undoubtedly very complicated question.

Before leaving this subject, it may be of interest to refer to cer-
tain points in Bohr’s theory of a more philosophical nature. It is
seen that the orbits and energies of the various groups of electrons
can be specified by certain quantum numbers and the nature of the
radiation associated with a change of orbit can be defined. But at the
same time we can not explain why these orbits are alone permissible
under normal conditions, or understand the mechanism by which ra-
diation is emitted. It may be quite possible to formulate accurately
the energy relation of the electrons in the atom on a simple theory,
176 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924 ~

and to explain in considerable detail all the properties of an atom,
without any clear understanding of the underlying processes which
lead to these results. It is natural to hope that with advance of
knowledge we may be able to grasp the details of the process which
leads to the emission of radiation, and to understand why the orbits
of the electrons in the atom are defined by the quantum relations.
Some, however, are inclined to take the view that in the present
state of knowledge it may be quite impossible in the nature of
things to form that detailed picture in space and time of succes-
sive events that we have been accustomed to consider as so import-
ant a part of a complete theory. The atom is naturally the most
fundamental structure presented to us. Its properties must explain
the properties of all more complicated structures, including matter
in bulk, but we may not, therefore, be justified in expecting that
its processes can be explained in terms of concepts derived entirely
from a study of molar properties. The atomic processes involved
may be so fundamental that a complete understanding may be
denied us. It is early yet to be pessimistic on this question, for
we may hope that our difficulties may any day be resolved by further
discoveries.

We must now turn our attention to that new and comparatively
unexplored territory, the nucleus of the atom. In a discussion on
the structure of the atom ten years ago, in answer to a question on
the structure of the nucleus, I was rash enough to say that it was
a problem that might well be left to the next generation, for at that
time there seemed to be few obvious methods of attack to throw light
on its constitution. While much more progress has been made
than appeared possible at that time, the problem of the structure
of the nucleus is inherently more difficult than the allied problem
already considered of the structure of the outer atom, where we
have a wealth of information obtained from the study of light
and X-ray spectra and from the chemical properties to test the
accuracy of our theories.

In the case of the nucleus, we know its resultant charge, fixed by
Moseley’s law, and its mass, which is very nearly equal to the mass
of the whole atom, since the mass of the planetary electrons is rela-
tively very small and may for most purposes be neglected. We
know that the nucleus is of size minute compared with that of the
whole atom, and can with some confidence set a maximum limit to
its size. The study of radioactive bodies has provided us with very
valuable information on the structure of the nucleus, for we know
that the « and @ particles must be expelled from it, and there is
strong evidence that the very penetrating y rays represent modes of
vibration of the electrons contained in its structure. In the long
series of transformations which occur in the uranium atom, eight

Se
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 177

a particles are emitted and six electrons, and it seems clear that the
nucleus of a heavy atom is built up, in part at least, of helium
nuclei and electrons. It is natural to suppose that many of the
ordinary stable atoms are constituted in a similar way. It is a
matter of remark that no indication has been, obtained that the
lightest nucleus, viz, that of hydrogen, is liberated in these trans-
formations, where the processes occurring are of so fundamental a
character. At the same time, it is evident that the hydrogen nucleus
must be a unit in the structure of some atoms, and this has been
confirmed by direct experiment. Mr. Chadwick and I have ob-
served that swift hydrogen nuclei are released from the elements
boron, nitrogen, flourine, sodium, aluminium, and phosphorus when
they are bombarded by swift « particles, and there is little room
for doubt that these hydrogen nuclei form an essential part of the
nuclear structure. The speed of ejection of these nuclei depends
on the velocity of the @ particle and on the element bombarded.
It is of interest to note that the hydrogen nuclei are liberated in all
directions, but the speed in the backward direction is always some-
what less than in the direction of the « particle. Such a result
receives a simple explanation if we suppose that the hydrogen nuclei
are not built into the main nucleus but exist as satellites probably
in motion round a central core. There can be no doubt that bom-
bardment by « particles has effected a veritable disintegration of the
nuclei of this group of elements. It is significant that the liberation
of hydrogen nuclei only occurs in elements of odd atomic number,
viz, 5, 7, 9, 11, 18, 15, the elements of even number appearing quite
unaffected. For a collision of an « particle to be effective, it must
either pass close to the nucleus or actually penetrate its structure.
The chance of this is excessively small on account of the minute
size of the nucleus. For example, although each individual « par-
ticle will pass through the outer structure of more than 100,000
atoms of aluminium in its path, it is only about one a particle in a
million that gets close enough to the nucleus to effect the liberation
of its hydrogen satellite.

This artificial disintegration of elements by a particles takes place
only on a minute scale, and its observation has only been possible by
the counting of individual swift hydrogen nuclei by the scintilla-
tions they produce in zine sulphide.

These experiments suggest that the hydrogen nucleus or proton
must be one of the fundamental units which build up a nucleus, and
it seems highly probable that the helium nucleus is a secondary
building unit composed of the very close union of four protons and
two electrons. The view that the nuclei of all atoms are ultimately
built up of protons of mass nearly one and of electrons has been
strongly supported and extended by the study of isotopes. It was
178 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

early observed that some of the radioactive elements which showed
distinct radioactive properties were chemically so alike that it was
impossible to effect their separation when mixed together. Similar
elements of this kind were called “isotopes” by Soddy, since they
appeared to occupy the same place in the periodic table. For
example, a number of radioactive elements in the uranium and_
thorium series have been found to have physical and chemical prop-
erties identical with those of ordinary lead, but yet to have atomic
weights differing from ordinary lead, and also distinctive radio-
active properties. The nuclear theory of the atom offers at once a
simple interpretation of the relation between isotopic elements.
Since the chemical properties of an element are controlled by its
nuclear charge and little influenced by its mass, isotopes must cor-
respond to atoms with the same nuclear charge but of different
nuclear mass. Such a view also offers a simple explanation why
the radioactive isotopes show different radioactive properties, for it
is to be anticipated that the stability of a nucleus will be much
influenced by its mass and arrangement.

Our knowledge of isotopes has been widely extended in the last
few years by Aston, who has devised an accurate direct method for
showing the presence of isotopes in the ordinary elements. He has
found that some of the elements are “ pure ”—1. e., consist of atoms
of identical mass—while others contain a mixture of two or more
isotopes. In the case of the isotopic elements, the atomic mass, as
ordinarily measured by the chemist, is a mean value depending on
the atomic masses of the individual isotopes and their relative abun-
dance. These investigations have not only shown clearly that the
number of distinct species of atoms is much greater than was sup-
posed but have brought out a relation between the elements of great
interest and importance. The atomic masses of the isotopes of most
of the elements examined have been found, to an accuracy of about
one in a thousand, to be whole numbers in terms of oxygen, 16. This
indicates that the nuclei are ultimately built up of protons of mass
very nearly one and of electrons. It is natural to suppose that this
building unit is the hydrogen nucleus, but that its average mass in
the complex nucleus is somewhat less than its mass in the free state
owing to the close packing of the charged units in the nuclear struc-
ture. We have already seen that the helium nucleus of mass 4 is
probably a secondary unit of great importance in the building up of
many atoms, and it may be that other simple combinations of pro-
tons and eleetrons of mass 2 and 3 occur in the nucleus, but these
have not been observed in the free state.

While the masses of the majority of the isotopes are nearly whole
numbers, certain cases have been observed by Aston where this rule
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 179

is slightly departed from. Such variations in mass may ultimately
prove of great importance in throwing light on the arrangement and
closeness of packing of the protons and electrons, and for this reason
it is to be hoped that it may soon prove possible to compare atomic
masses of the elements with much greater precision even than at
present. |

While we may be confident that the proton and the electron are the
ultimate units which take part in the building up of all nuclei, and
can deduce with some certainty the number of protons and electrons
in the nuclei of all atoms, we have little, if any, information on the
distribution of these units in the atom or on the nature of the forces
that hold them in equilibrium. While it is known that the law of
the inverse square holds for the electrical forces some distance from
the nucleus, it seems certain that this law breaks down inside the
nucleus. A detailed study of the collisions between « particles and
hydrogen atoms, where the nuclei approach very close to each other,
shows that the forces between nuclei increase ultimately much more
rapidly than is to be expected from the law of the inverse square,
and it may be that new and unexpected forces may come into impor-
tance at the very small distances separating the protons and elec-
trons in the nucleus. Until we gain more information on the nature
and law of variation of the forces inside the nucleus, further prog-
ress on the detailed structure of the nucleus may be difficult. At
the same time, there are still a number of hopeful directions in which
an attack may be made on this most difficult of problems. A detailed
study of the y rays from radioactive bodies may be expected to
yield information as to the motion of the electrons inside the nucleus,
and it may be, as Ellis has suggested, that quantum laws are opera-
tive inside as well as outside the nucleus. From a study of the rela-
tive proportions of the elements in the earth’s crust, Harkins has
shown that elements of even atomic number are much more abundant
than elements of odd number, suggesting a marked difference of
stability in these two classes of elements. It seems probable that
any process of stellar evolution must be intimately connected with
the building up of complex nuclei from simpler ones, and its study
may thus be expected to throw much light on the evolution of the
elements.

The nucleus of a heavy atom is undoubtedly a very complicated
system, and in a sense a world of its own, litile, if at all, influenced by
the ordinary physical and chemical agencies at our command. When
we consider the mass of a nucleus compared with its volume it seems
certain that its density is many billions of times that of our heaviest
element. Yet, if we could form a magnified picture of the nucleus,
we should expect that it would show a discontinuous structure, occu-
180 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

pied but not filled by the minute building units, the protons and
electrons, in ceaseless rapid motion controlled by their mutual forces.

Before leaving this subject it is desirable to say a few words on
the important question of the energy relations involved in the forma-
tion and disintegration of atomic nuclei, first opened up by the study
of radioactivity. For example, it is well known that the total evo-
lution of energy during the complete disintegration of 1 gram of
radium is many millions of times greater than in the complete com-
bustion of an equal weight of coal. It is known that this energy
is initially mostly emitted in the kinetic form of swift « and 8 par-
ticles, and the energy of motion of these bodies is ultimately con-
verted into heat when they are stopped by matter. Since it is be-
lieved that the radioactive elements were analogous in structure to
the ordinary inactive elements the idea naturally arose that the atoms
of all the elements contained a similar concentration of energy, which
would be available for use if only some simple method could be dis-
covered of promoting and controlling their disintegration. This
possibility of obtaining new and cheap sources of energy for prac-
tical purposes was naturally an alluring prospect to the lay and
scientific man alike. It is quite true that, if we were able to hasten
the radioactive processes in uranium and thorium so that the whole
cycle of their disintegration could be confined to a few days instead
of being spread over thousands of millions of years, these elements
would provide very convenient sources of energy on a sufficient scale
to be of considerable practical importance. Unfortunately, although
many experiments have been tried, there is no evidence that the rate
of disintegration of these elements can be altered in the slightest
degree by the most powerful laboratory agencies. With increase in
our knowledge of atomic structure there has been a gradual change
of our point of view on this important question, and there is by no
means the same certainty to-day as a decade ago that the atoms of
an element contain hidden stores of energy. It may be worth while
to spend a few minutes in discussing the reason for this change in
outlook. This can best be illustrated by considering an interesting
analogy between the transformation of a radioactive nucleus and the
changes in the electron arrangement of an ordinary atom. It is now
well known that it is possible by means of electron bombardment or
by appropriate radiation to excite an atom in such a way that one
of its superficial electrons is displaced from its ordinary stable posi-
tion to another temporarily stable position further removed from
the nucleus. This electron in course of time falls back into its old
position, and its potential energy is converted into radiation in the
process. There is some reason for believing that the electron has a
definite average life in the displaced position, and that the chance
of its return to its original position is governed by the laws of proba-

ke. ee
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 181

bility. In some respects an “excited” atom of this kind is thus
analogous to a radioactive atom, but of course the energy released
in the disintegration of a nucleus is of an entirely different order of
magnitude from the energy released by return of the electron in the
excited atom. It may be that the elements, uranium and thorium,
represent the sole survivals in the earth to-day of types of elements
that were common in the long-distant ages, when the atoms now com-
posing the earth were in course of formation. A fraction of the
atoms of uranium and thorium formed at that time has survived
over the long interval on account of their very slow rate of trans-
formation. It is thus possible to regard these atoms as having not
yet completed the cycle of changes which the ordinary atoms have
long since passed through, and that the atoms are still in the “ ex-
cited ” state where the nuclear units have not yet arranged them-
selves in positions of ultimate equilibrium, but still have a surplus
of energy which can only be released in the form of the character-
istic radiation from active matter. On such a view, the presence of
a store of energy ready for release is not a property of all atoms, but
only of a special class of atoms like the radioactive atoms which have
not yet reached the final state for equilibrium.

It may be urged that the artificial disintegration of certain ele-
ments by bombardment with swift « particles gives definite evidence
of a store of energy in some of the ordinary elements, for it is known
that a few of the hydrogen nuclei, released from aluminium, for
example, are expelled with such swiftness that the particle has a
greater individual energy than the @ particle which causes their
liberation. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to give a definite
answer on this point until we know more of the details of this dis-
integration.

On the other hand, another method of attack on this question has
become important during the last few years, based on the compari-
son of the relative masses of the elements. This new point of view
can best be illustrated by a comparison of the atomic masses of
hydrogen and helium. As we have seen, it seems very probable that
helium is not an ultimate unit in the structure of nuclei but is a
very close combination of four hydrogen nuclei and two electrons.
The mass of the helium nucleus, 4.00 in terms of O=16, is con-
siderably less than the mass 4.03 of four hydrogen nuclei. On mod-
ern views there is believed to be a very close connection between
mass and energy, and this loss in mass in the synthesis of the helium
nucleus from hydrogen nuclei indicates that a large amount of
energy in the form of radiation has been released in the building
of the helium nucleus from its components. It is easy to caleu-
late from this loss of mass that the energy set free in forming 1

20397—25——18
182 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

gram of helium is large even compared with that liberated in the
total disintegration of 1 gram of radium. For example, calculation
shows that the energy released in the formation of 1 pound of
helium gas is equivalent to the energy emitted in the complete com-
bustion of about 8,000 tons of pure carbon. It has been suggested by
Eddington and Perrin that it is mainly to this source of energy
that we must look to maintain the heat emission of the sun and
hot stars over long periods of time. Calculations of the loss of
heat from the sun show that this synthesis of helium need only
take place slowly in order to maintain the present rate of radiation
for periods of the order of 1,000 million years. It must be
acknowledged that these arguments are somewhat speculative in
character, for no certain experimental evidence has yet been ob-
tained that helium can be formed from hydrogen.

The evidence of the slow rate of stellar evolution, however, cer-
tainly indicates that the synthesis of helium and perhaps other ele-
ments of higher atomic weight may take place slowly in the in-
terior of hot stars. While in the electric discharge through hydrogen
at low pressure we can easily reproduce the conditions of the in-
terior of the hottest star, as far as regards the energy of motion
of the electrons and hydrogen nuclei, we can not hope to reproduce
that enormous density of radiation which must exist in the interior
of a giant star. For this and other reasons it may be very difficult
or even impossible, to produce helium from hydrogen under labora-
tory conditions.

If this view of the great heat emission in the formation of helium
be correct, it is clear that the helium nucleus is the most stable of
all nuclei, for an amount of energy corresponding to three or four
a particles would be required to disrupt it into its components. In
addition, since the mass of the proton in nuclei is nearly 1.000 in-
stead of its mass 1.0072 in the free state, it follows that much more
energy must be put into the atom than will be liberated by its dis-
integration into its ultimate units. At the same time, if we consider
an atom of oxygen, which may be supposed to be built up of four
helium nuclei as secondary units, the change of mass, if any, in its
synthesis from already formed helium nuclei is so small that we
can not yet be certain whether there will be a gain or loss of energy
by its disintegration into helium nuclei, but in any case we are cer-

tain that the magnitude of the energy will be much less than for —
the synthesis of helium from hydrogen. Our information on this —
subject of energy changes in the formation or disintegration of —
atoms in general is as yet too uncertain and speculative to give any —

decided opinion on future possibilities in this direction, but I have

\
j
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—RUTHERFORD 183

endeavored to outline some of the main arguments which should be
taken into account.

I must now bring to an end my survey—I am afraid all too brief
and inadequate—of this great period of advance in physical science.
In the short time at my disposal it has been impossible for me, even
if I had the knowledge, to refer to the great advances made during
the period under consideration in all branches of pure and applied
science. JI am well aware that in some departments the progress
made may justly compare with that of my own subject. In these
great additions to our knowledge of the structure of matter every
civilized nation has taken an active part, but we may be justly proud
that this country has made many fundamental contributions. With
this country I must properly include our dominions overseas, for
they have not been behindhand in their contributions to this new
knowledge. It is, I am sure, a matter of pride to this country that
the scientific men of our dominions have been responsible for some
of the most fundamental discoveries of this epoch, particularly in
radioactivity.

This tide of advance was continuous from 1896, but there was an
inevitable slackening during the war. It is a matter of good omen
that in the last few years the old rate of progress has not only been
maintained but even intensified, and there appears to be no obvious
sign that this period of great advances has come to an end. There
has never been a time when the enthusiasm of the scientific workers
was greater, or when there was a more hopeful feeling that great
advances were imminent. This feeling is no doubt in part due to
the great improvement during this epoch of the technical methods
of attack, for problems that at one time seemed unattackable are
now seen to be likely to fall before the new methods. In the main
the epoch under consideration has been an age of experiment, where
the experimenter has been the pioneer in the attack on new prob-
lems. At the same time it has been also an age of bold ideas in
theory, as the quantum theory and the theory of relativity so well
illustrate.

I feel it is a great privilege to have witnessed this period, which
may almost be termed the renaissance of physics. It has been of
extraordinary intellectual interest to watch the gradual unfolding of
new ideas and the ever-changing methods of attack on difficult prob-
lems. It has been of great interest, too, to note the comparative sim-
plicity of the ideas that have ultimately emerged. For example, no
one could have anticipated that the general relation between the ele-
ments would prove to be of so simple a character as we now believe
it to be. It is an illustration of the fact that nature appears to work
in a simple way, and that the more fundamental the problem often
184 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924 .

simpler are the conceptions needed for its explanation. The rapid-
ity and certitude of the advance in this epoch have largely depended
on the fact that it has been possible to devise experiments so that few
variables were involved. For example, the study of the structure of
the atom has been much facilitated by the possibility of examining
the effects due to a single atom of matter, or, as in radioactivity or
X rays, of studying processes going on in the individual atom which
were quite uninfluenced by external conditions.

In watching the rapidity of this tide of advance in physics I have
become more and more impressed by the power of the scientific
method of extending our knowledge of nature. Experiment, directed
by the disciplined imagination either of an individual, or still better,
of a group of individuals of varied mental outlook, is able to achieve
results which far transcend the imagination alone of the greatest
natural philosopher. Experiment without imagination, or imagina-
tion without recourse to experiment, can accomplish little, but, for
effective progress, a happy blend of these two powers is necessary.
The unknown appears as a dense mist before the eyes of men. In
penetrating this obscurity we can not invoke the aid of supermen,
but must depend on the combined efforts of a number of adequately
trained ordinary. men of scientific imagination. Each in his own
special field of inquiry is enabled by the scientific method to pene-
trate a short distance, and his work reacts upon and influences the
whole body of other workers. From time to time there arises an
illuminating conception, based on accumulated knowledge, which
lights up a large region and shows the connection between these in-
dividual efforts, so that a general advance follows. The attack
begins anew on a wider front, and often with improved technical
weapons. The conception which led to this advance often appears
simple and obvious when once it has been put forward. This is a
common experience, and the scientific man often feels a sense of dis-
appointment that he himself had not foreseen a development which
ultimately seems so clear and inevitable.

The intellectual interest due to the rapid growth of science to-day
can not fail to act as a stimulus to young men to join in scientific
investigation. In every branch of science there are numerous prob-
lems of fundamental interest and importance which await solution.
We may confidently predict an accelerated rate of progress of scien-
tific discovery, beneficial to mankind certainly in a material but pos-
sibly even more so in an intellectual sense. In order to obtain the
best results certain conditions must, however, be fulfilled. It is
necessary that our universities and other specific institutions should
be liberally supported, so as not only to be in a position to train ade-
quately young investigators of promise, but also to serve themselves
as active centers of research. At the same time there must be a

ae

——
ELECTRICAL STRUCTURE OF MATTER—-RUTHERFORD 185

reasonable competence for those who have shown a capacity for
original investigation. Not least, peace throughout the civilized
world is as important for rapid scientific development as for general
commercial prosperity. Indeed, science is truly international, and
for progress in many directions the cooperation of nations is as
essential as the cooperation of individuals. Science, no less than
industry, desires a stability not yet achieved in world conditions.

There is an error far too prevalent to-day that science progresses
by the demolition of former well-established theories. Such is very
rarely the case. For example, it is often stated that Einstein’s gen-
eral theory of relativity has overthrown the work of Newton on
gravitation. No statement could be farther from the truth. Their
works, in fact, are hardly comparable, for they deal with different
fields of thought. So far as the work of Einstein is relevant to that
of Newton, it is simply a generalization and broadening of its basis;
in fact, a typical case of mathematical and physical development.
In general, a great principle is not discarded but so modified that. it
rests on a broader and more stable basis.

It is clear that the splendid period of scientific activity which we
have reviewed to-night owes much of its success and intellectual ap-
peal to the labors of those great men in the past, who wisely laid the
sure foundations on which the scientific worker builds to-day, or to
quote from the words inscribed in the dome of the National Gallery,
“The works of those who have stood the test of ages have a claim to
that respect and veneration to which no modern can pretend.”

THE PHYSICIST’S PRESENT CONCEPTION OF AN ATOM’

By R. A. MILLIKAN
Norman Bridge Laboratory of Physics

All scientists agree upon an atom which has a very minute posi-
tively charged nucleus surrounded in its outer regions by a number
of negative electrons just sufficient to neutralize the free positive
charge upon the nucleus.

We all agree that the number of these positive charges upon the
nucleus varies from 1, in the case of hydrogen, by unit steps up
to 92 in the case of uranium, and hence that the number of negatives
held in the outer regions also varies from 1 to 92.

We all agree that the chemical properties of all atoms, and most of
the physical properties, too, mass being the chief exception, are de-
termined simply by the number of these electrons; primarily by the
number of them which are found in the outermost shell and which
we call the valence electrons.

We all agree, too, that the nucleus is extraordinarily minute, so
that if all the dimensions of an atom were magnified ten billion
times—a magnification which would make a bird shot swell to the
size of the earth and would make the diameter of the atom about a
meter—the nucleus, on this huge scale of magnification, would not
be more than a tenth of a millimeter in diameter—that is, not larger
than a mere pin point.

We all agree, too, that in the case of uranium there are packed into
that infinitesimal nucleus 238 positive and 146 negative electrons, the
exact number of positives being determined simply by the atomic
weight, while the number of negatives which bind the positives is the
atomic weight minus the atomic number. This obviously means that
both positive and negative electrons are so infinitesimally small that
for practical purposes we may ignore their dimensions altogether and
think of them as mere point charges.

We all agree that so far as physical science has now gone there

have appeared but these two fundamental entities, namely, positive

Society, Washington, D. C., Apr. 22, 1924. Reprinted by permission from Science, Vol.
LIX, No. 1535, May 30, 1924.

187
188 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

and negative electrons? which seem to be the building stones of the
universe; that these two entities are electrical charges of exactly the
same magnitude, but of opposite sign, 'and that the mass or inertia
associated with the former is 1,845 times that associated with the
latter, so that practically the whole mass of the atom is concentrated
in the positive electrons within its nucleus.

We all agree that when ‘any of the electrons in the outer regions
of the atom are stimulated to radiate, they do so by virtue of falling
from a level of higher potential energy to one of lower, i. e., from a
level more remote from the nucleus to one nearer to it.

And we all agree that the frequency of the emitted radiations is
proportional to the energy loss in the process of changing from the
one level to the other. Indeed, one of the most stimulating advances
which physicists have made in the past five years consists in the com-
plete demonstration of this Planck-Einstein-Bohr law of radiation.
Very recent experiments go even so far as to indicate that this law
holds not only for the radiations emitted by the changes in energy
levels of the electrons outside the nucleus, but also for the radiations
which originate in the nucleus itself—the so-called gamma rays which
accompany changes within the nuclei of radioactive atoms.

These results upon which we all agree are proof enough of the
amazing advances which have taken place, mostly within the past
ten years, in our ability to peer inside the atom and to see what kind
of entities exist there and what they are doing when they are in the
act of radiating.

The only place where we have differences of opinion, or better, in
which there are uncertainties, is in the matter of how the electrons
spend their leisure time—the portions of their lives in which they
are not radiating.

The chemist has in general been content with what I will call the
“loafer” electron theory. He has imagined these electrons sitting
around on dry goods boxes at every corner ready to shake hands with,
or hold on to, similar electrons in other atoms. The physicist, on the
other hand, has preferred to think of them as leading more active
lives, playing ring-around-the-rosy, crack-the-whip, and other in-
teresting games. In other words, he has pictured them as rotating
with enormous speeds in orbits, and as occasionally flying out of
these orbits for one reason or another.

2It is highly to be desired that this historically correct, etymologically most suitable,
and authoritatively recognized nomenclature (see Rutherford’s B. A. address 1923,
Nernst’s Physical Chemistry, last edition, etc.) be retained. When used without a prefix
or qualifying adjective the word electron may signify both the generic thing, the unit
electrical charge (this it does, in fact, signify both historically and derivatively), and at
the same time the negative member of the species, in precisely the way in which the
word man is used without a prefix to designate both the genus homo and also the male
of the species. There is no gain in convenience by the use of the word proton and a
distinct loss logically, etymologically, and historically.

PRESENT CONCEPTION OF AN ATOM—MILLIKAN 189

Now the arguments for the “loafer electron” theory, as I have
called it, are two in number. The first is that such activity as the
physicist postulates would soon wear away ‘all the energy possessed
by the electrons—that is, they would tire themselves out and quit
their play.

There is no answer to this argument. They would indeed tire
themselves out, provided the classical electromagnetic laws are uni-
versally applicable—even in the hearts of atoms. And the physicist’s
only answer to this argument is, “ God did not make electrons that
way. Why assume that the electromagnetic laws are universally
valid when this is the first chance we have had to test them out in
the region of the infinitely small ?”

The second argument which has been advanced for the “ loafer
electron ” theory is the existence of localized valences in chemistry.
Now, that these localized valences exist is admitted on all hands; but
it is simply due to a misunderstanding that this argument was ever
used against the orbit theory. For no physicist—and I wish to empha-
size this fact—has ever advanced the theory that the electrons all ro-
tate in coplanar orbits. Localized valences probably are just as com-
patible with the orbit theory when the orbits are properly distributed
in space as with the stationary electron conception. All this I pointed
out in 1916,* trying thereby to clear the misconception which existed
in the minds of chemists as to the way in which physicists were
thinking.

Let me pass now to the arguments in favor of the orbit theory.
They are all of them definite quantitative arguments in which purely
theoretical considerations lead to exact numerical predictions which
can be subjected to the test of experiment.

The first was the exact prediction with the aid of orbit equations
of the so-called Rydberg spectroscopic constant which is in agree-
ment, with an accuracy of one part in five hundred, with the directly
measured value.

The second quantitative argument comes from the prediction of a
difference between the positions in two spectral lines, one due to
helium, the other to hydrogen, which two lines should theoretically
be one and the same line, if it were not for the fact that the helium
nucleus is four times as massive as the hydrogen nucleus.

To make clear the difference which this causes let me ask you to
refiect that when an electron revolves ‘around the nucleus of an atom
of hydrogen, the real thing that happens is that the two bodies re-
volve about their common center of gravity, but, since the nucleus
is 2,000 times heavier than the electron, this center is exceedingly
close to the hydrogen nucleus. If now the hydrogen nucleus is re-

190 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

placed by the nucleus of the helium atom, which is four times as
heavy as that of hydrogen, the common center of gravity is still
closer to the nucleus so that the helium nucleus describes a much
smaller circle than does the hydrogen nucleus. This situation is re-
sponsible for a certain slight but accurately predictable difference in
the energies of the two orbits which should cause the lines produced
by electron jumps to these two different orbits to be slightly displaced
from one another. This displacement is actually found between the
corresponding hydrogen and helium lines, and the ratio of the mass
of the electron to the mass of the hydrogen atom computed from this
displacement agrees with other determinations of this ratio to within
a small fraction of a per cent.

The third amazing quantitative success of the orbit theory came
when Sommerfeld showed that the Bohr orbit theory ought to
demand two different hydrogen orbits corresponding to the second
quantum state, one a circle and one an ellipse. And by applying
the relativity theory to the change in mass of the electron with its
change in speed, as it moves through the different portions of its
orbit, he showed that these two orbits should have slightly different
energies, and consequently that both the hydrogen and the helium
lines should be doublets.

Now not only is this found to be the fact, but the measured
separation of these two doublet lines agrees precisely with the
predicted value, so that this again constitutes an extraordinary
bit of quantitative evidence for the validity of the orbit conceptions
underlying the computation.

The fourth quantitative argument was introduced by Epstein
when he applied his extraordinary grasp of orbit theory to the exceed-
ingly difficult problem of computing the perturbations in electron
orbits and hence the change in energy of each due to exciting
hydrogen and helium atoms to radiate in an electrostatic field.
He thus predicted the whole complex character of what we call the
Stark effect, showing just how many new lines were to be expected
and where each one should fall, and then the spectroscope yielded,
in practically every detail, precisely the result which the Epstein
theory had foretold.

The fifth quantitative success of the orbit theory is one which
Mr. I. 8. Bowen and myself at the California Institute have Just
brought to light. Through creating what we call “hot sparks” in
extreme vacuum, we have succeeded in stripping in succession one,
two, three, four, five, six, and seven of the valence, or outer, electrons
from the atoms studied. In going from lithium through beryllium,
boron and carbon to nitrogen, we have thus been able to play with
stripped atoms of all these substances. Now the stripped atoms
PRESENT CONCEPTION OF AN ATOM—MILLIKAN 191

constitute structures which are all exactly alike, save that the fields
in which the single electron which is left is describing its orbit
increase in the ratios one, two, three, four, five, as we go from
stripped lithium to stripped nitrogen. Now we have applied the
relativity doublet formula which, as indicated above, Sommerfeld
had developed for the simple nucleus-electron system found in
hydrogen and ionized helium, and have found that it not only
predicts everywhere the observed doublet separation of the spectra
produced by all these stripped atoms, but that it enables us to com-
pute the effect which the two electrons close. to the nucleus of all
these atoms have in screening the outer rotating electron from
this nucleus.

At a sufficient distance from the nucleus these two electrons ought
to neutralize exactly two of the free positive charges on the nucleus,
provided, and only provided, the forces emanating from these elec-
trons fall off with the inverse square of the distance. Our relativity
doublet formula, with this assumption and without the introduction
of any arbitrary constants whatsoever, enabled us to predict what
the screening effect due to those two electrons ought to be. And now
our experiments on doublet separations reveal that that screening is
within one per cent of two, which checks with what we knew before-
hand, from radioactive and chemical data, that it ought to be. In
other words, we have another method which enables us with certainty
to look inside the atom and find how many electrons are in the inmost
shell, and the answer comes out two.

Again, when we examine the spectrum due to the stripped atoms
of the group of atoms from sodium to chlorine—one electron having
been knocked off from sodium, two from magnesium, three from
aluminium, four from silicon, five from phosphorus, six from
sulphur, and seven from chlorine—we should find in every case that
the number of screening electrons in the two inmost shells, when
tested for sufficiently remote orbits, comes out two plus eight, 1. e.,
ten. And it does come out in every case very nearly as predicted.
This constitutes excellent evidence that the electrons at these dis-
tances and under these conditions do possess Coulomb fields (fields
falling off with the inverse square of the distance), a result appar-
ently incompatible with the loafer-electron theory. The physicist
has thus piled Ossa on Pelion in his quantitative proof of the exist-
ence of these electron orbits.

These new results are, however, incompatible with the precise
shapes of orbits with which the physicists have been working
in the field of optics during the last five years. They necessitate
either the abandonment of the relativity cause for the separation
of our measured spectroscopic doublets or else they require us to
192 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

cease to play with a nucleus about which the electron orbits are
largely symmetrical. In other words, if we retain the relativity
explanation of the spectroscopic-doublet formula, we are obliged
to suppose that two orbits which have the same shape but different
orientations with respect to the nucleus may exhibit widely different
screening constants—which is only another way of saying that
these orbits may possess widely different energies.

To this extent, then, I am able to help out the chemist in his
attack upon the electronic orbits of the physicists. I am able to
enable him to say with a good deal of certainty that these orbits
can not be of precisely the type which we physicists have been
playing with so assiduously for the past five years. If we retain
the explanation which has heretofore been given to the relativity
doublet formula, an explanation which requires entirely different
shapes for the two orbits corresponding to these doublets, then
we must begin to work with an atom which is very much less sym-
metrical with respect to the differently oriented orbits than we have
hitherto been imagining.
THE VACUUM—THERE’S SOMETHING IN IT?

By Dr. W. R. WHITNEY
Director, Research Laboratory, General Electric Co.

[With 5 plates]

We humans want better minds, broader horizons, and_ greater
understanding. Scientists everywhere are at work in their respec-
tive fields searching for new truths to improve the process by which
our minds, our horizons, our powers, and our outlooks grow.

When in the middle ages the great cathedrals of the world were
being built the mentality of men seems to have been directed to sys-
tematic subordination of creation rather than to active appreciation
of it; to acquiring salvation, or “safety first,” rather than knowledge
or understanding. To-day scientists, in seeking truth, think of
“safety first” last.

We are told that if the total age of mankind be expressed as the
life of a man of 50 years and, if he then looks back upon his progress,
he will see that what marks his greatest advancement .are events
occurring in the most recent years. For example, such a 50-year man
now sees that he had not learned to scratch the simplest records on
stone until his forty-ninth year. All the immense advantages of
printing have existed only three months for him. He has only just
learned how to pass along what he has learned. The uses of steam,
which now seem so necessary, were acquired only three or four days
ago. The uses of electricity (street cars, lamps, and telephones),
which did not actually begin until about 1880, arrived the day before
yesterday to this 50-year man. The automobile, radio, X rays, ra-
dium, and most of the things which occupy our interests to-day were
actually discovered on this particular fiftieth birthday.

The power outside of his own muscles, which during the past two
or three months he has learned to control, has grown to nearly 20
horsepower, or 200 man power, for every man in the country. There-
fore it makes only one-half a per cent difference whether all the men
work like horses or not. But guidance of power is man work, be-
cause there are no machine mentalities. Almost everything but

194 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

thinking may be artificially done, but knowledge and understanding
must be actively sought and used. Man is the only animal that can
do this.

Scientists know that research merely discloses new parts of the
infinite unknown. Paradoxically, the enticing, helpful “unknown”
increases as men continue to subtract from it. Progress in every line
of experimental science follows the same law. The apparently nar-
row path gradually expands into unlimited, unexplored territory.
With his new tools and his increased speed of communication man
finds that he can advance into the unknown faster than his ancestors
could, and children seem to learn more rapidly than he did when he
was young. The scientists of the twentieth century are legion. But
scientists were anathema a short time ago. There is to-day more
chemistry in the atom than there was in all “inorganic” chemistry
a few years ago. There is more in the “sugars” now than there was
in all “organic” when the writer studied it. There is more im-
munity in blood and more heredity in the microscopic chromosome
than there was in all biology until recently. There is more crystal
structure research by X rays now than research in all mineralogy
when Agassiz came to America.

In the preparation of an article the purpose of which is to direct
attention to the interest connected with research work in general
there is special reason for selecting as the subject such a narrow field
as the vacuum. The writer wishes to show that in a vacuum, of
which one might say “There is nothing in it” (and surely less than
in anything else), there is, indeed, an endless amount of interest and
utility. The American public now buys over a million dollars’ worth
of glass vacua a week, but that is the least interesting part of the
subject.

Everybody pretends to know that “Nature abhors a vacuum.”
But he who started that tale merely meant that a good vacuum was
hard to produce. As probably no one has ever made a vacuum with
less gas molecules in a cubic inch than there are people in the world,
we can maintain that perfection in vacua is still precluded by nature.

Some studies in vacua will now be reviewed for the purpose of
showing that anyone may well do research work not only there but
also certainly anywhere else with pleasure and profit.

We all know that we see at night largely by the aid of vacuum
lamps. Through other vacuum lamps, called X-ray tubes, we also
see through opaque bodies. The light which illumines our micro-
scope specimen has its analogue in the X-ray light, which shows us
the crystal structure of matter and the electrical formulas of chem-
ical atoms. Our transcontinental wired telephony is possible through
yacuum tubes which, in various forms, also permit our radio broad-
casting and radio reception from the most remote stations. The
THE VACUUM—THERE’S SOMETHING IN IT—WHITNEY 195

workman who keeps his drink hot or cold in a thermos bottle is
clearly indebted to Sir James Dewar’s application of the vacuum,
but the scientist is still more indebted to it. All our steam-power
plants, including turbines, owe their success to vacua.

The latest arrival in the family of the chemical elements (haf-
nium) was discovered by trying it in vacuum as an X-ray target.
Our list of possible chemical elements was rounded off by Moseley’s
study of the X-ray spectra just in time to meet the wonderful dis-
coveries of J. J. Thomson and Aston, all made in vacua. The latter
showed that most of the elements, supposedly simple, are still mix-
tures of two or more similar elements (isotopes), while Professor
Thomson’s experiments disclosed by the positive ray method a
whole series of new atomic compounds.

While the vacuum was not essential to the work of Millikan in
isolating the electron, yet the earlier work by Thomson and others
and much of the recent work on this ultimate constituent of matter
has been necessarily carried out in vacuum. To-day there seems
to be no end to the studies which can be based on the fact that an
atom or molecule of material may be separated electrically into a
positively charged ion (carrying most of the mass) and a negatively
charged electron (carrying most of the current).

ELECTRICITY

Without sacrificing historical truth too much, it may be asserted
that electricity at rest was the first kind known. It then seems logi-
cal that electricity in simple direct motions should later appear and
that still later we should find various directions and rates of its
motion, if it moves at all. It will interrupt this line of argument if
we doubt the existence of electricity as a thing or question the exist-
ence of such different kinds of it as static and dynamic. The elec-
tricity of rubbed amber was the first and stationary kind (if it is
admitted that prior to Thales such things as lightning were some-
thing else). When electricity first moved through metals the process
was looked upon as a simple directed flow which proceeded until the
charged body had delivered its charge.

CURRENTS

This direct flow of electricity (a current) was strengthened in its
hold on our conception by the great number of different chemical
current producers which followed the controversies between Gal-
vani and Volta a century and a quarter ago. Primary and secondary
or storage batteries without number were soon discovered. The cur-
rent from such batteries was exactly like that which the magneto-
electric machines produced, when these were developed, after Fara-
day had shown the effect of moving a wire through a magnetic field.
196 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

The direct current of such generating machines was much later
followed by the alternated flow, and soon alternating-current gen-
erators were made for different rates of reversal of direction. Sixty-
cycle and twenty-five-cycle currents are now common, and the user
takes his choice. These frequencies were once accidents of conven-
lence and economy. For some uses other widely different frequencies
of alternation are very desirable, as in radio, where 1,000,000 cycles
are common.

Now the phenomena which have been found in vacuum tubes prom-
ise to give complete control over all these details of kind and fre-
quency of current.

ELECTRICAL CONTROL

As will be more fully shown later, when a unidirectional current
meets vacuum tubes as though it would pass through them, it must
find one particular kind of a tube, and the current’s direction must:
be right, because some tubes will let it through only when it is both
unidirectional and in the proper direction. These in themselves are
rather remarkable things to expect of a vacuum, but as usual the
truth exceeds the expectation.

CATALYSIS

To give some idea of the extent to which vacuum studies may
affect remote fields, mention may be made of chemical catalysis, the
secret of most reactions of life. For example, it is known that
mercury vapor in a vacuum, when illumined by light of a certain
wave length, will absorb that light and turn the energy over to
hydrogen, if hydrogen be present, so that this, in turn, will chem-
ically reduce such substances as cold copper oxide. Here is a new
kind of chemical process. It is the kind we have needed in order to
begin to explain some of those life reactions which vegetation dis-
closes. That is, similar facts will probably be found to contain the
explanation of the catalytic action of sunlight on growing plants.

And so the studies of phenomena in vacua may lead us into the
most widely separated fields. The experiments described in the lat-
ter part of this article are illustrations of this fact and are thus not
chosen to be very closely related.

KINDS OF VACUA

One might say, as in our school-day essays, “There are different
kinds of vacuum, too numerous to mention,” and then proceed. to
mention them all. However, only a few cases will be selected for
the purpose of illustration. A certain kind of vacuum is good
enough for incandescent lamps, because other factors. besides the
THE VACUUM—THERE’S SOMETHING IN IT—WHITNEY 197

quality of its vacuum determine the death or limit the performance
of a lamp. But while formerly the incandescent lamp represented
the very highest skill then reached in vacuum production, there are
now other commercial vacua which are necessarily quite superior.
This is true of good thermos bottles, X-ray tubes, and radio tubes.
We should first, therefore, give brief consideration to the incan-
descent lamp and note a few characteristics. Its low vacuum early
disclosed electric cross currents which would not have been found in
much higher vacua. Study of these currents has led not only to the
vacuum tubes used in radio, but also to such remote disclosures as
that distillation or evaporation of solids in vacuum proceeds in
straight lines. The electrical currents in poor vacua are best known
in luminous Geissler tubes, Moore tubes, and Claude tubes, as seen
on the streets of Paris, for example. They are themselves a large
subject, but consideration will be given (later on) only to one his-
torically important experiment with them, the Hittorf experiment.

HIGH VACUA

Electric currents through vacua, where gas is so completely re-
moved that it has no appreciable action, are most strictly a part of
this article. After the work by which the individual and indivisible
negative electrical charge or electron was defined, it seemed quite
fitting, though unexpected, to learn that these negative charges were
exuded by hot bodies. The result of this disclosure formed the basis
for most of the modern electrical phenomena in vacua. The activi-
ties of electrons are apparently the cause of most electrical and chem-
ical processes. Their motion constitutes electric currents, and the
currents are determined and controlled by voltage or potential dif-
ference.

Bees might illustrate electronics, though it’s admittedly bad. policy
to push bees too hard. If bees represent electrons, then matter in
general becomes the hives. When the hives are cold or in the dark
the bees stay inside. Under the effect of heat or light the bees are
induced to come out. Similarly highly heated matter, such as tung-
sten, exudes electrons; and at ordinary temperatures light induces
electrons out of metallic potassium, for example.

What are the bees or electrons going to do after they are out of
the hive (or the metal)? That depends on impulse or pressure.
They will fly in that special direction which tends to relieve that
particular-pressure. They proceed down the gradient. The electrons
coming out of the metal (because of heat or light) will also fly in
that special direction which will tend to relieve the particular elec-
trical pressure. They also proceed down the gradient. But if there
198 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

is no particular impulse or gradient, both bees and electrons hang
around the source.

A lot of electrons, like bees, flying in a common direction, becomes
a current or cathode ray. We might let them fly from the hot or
lighted spot into a cold or dark one, and until we heated or lighted
the latter they would not come out. This unidirectional current cor-
responds to what takes place in rectifiers and kenotrons, where we
have impulses in two opposite directions between one hot and one
cold electrode in vacuum. If the hives (or the electrodes) are equal
in, temperature or illumination, no differential in current is possible,
and with alternating impulses alternating instead of pulsating direct
current passes. Thus bees illustrate two-electrode vacuum devices.

In the three-electrode vacuum tubes the third electrode is a sort
of grid, or open fence, located between the hot and cold electrodes.
This grid lets electrons pass freely, except when it is negatively
charged. Thus also the bees would pass through a wire fence when
they might be stopped if their impulse to proceed could be suddenly
removed there. The negative charge is used in the three-element
tube to alter the intention of the migrating bees or electrons as often
as desired, and this with the rapidity of light.

In the case of radio, it is the impulse from the antenna or loop,
changing with every delicate change of voice-current or code-cur-
rent, which, when led to the grid, charges it and thus controls the
currents within the receiving tube. These controlled currents do
the work in the telephone. ji

Everybody knows that radio tubes are very sensitive. One cat-
power of electricity used in New York actually puts the impulses
into a receiving outfit in San Francisco, and at the same time it also
puts the identical impulses into millions of other receivers. But
some appreciable energy must be used by each receiver to direct the
local battery which operates the head sets. This minute quantity
of energy may be made significant as follows:

If a house fly climbs up a window pane 1 inch, he does a definite
amount of work in lifting his body that much. If this work con-
stituted the supply fed into the receiving tube from space, it would
suffice to actuate the outfit continuously for a quarter of a century.
This might interest a future student of telepathy, if the time comes
to determine how far the energy of one thought may influence
thought in a distant brain. It has not been possible thus far to
determine the quantity of energy which is expended in thought.
Just keeping alive transfers so much energy into heat that the addi-
tional energy transferred when we think has been too small to detect.
But it need not be small compared to the power sensitivity of a
radio set. |
THE VACUUM—THERE’S SOMETHING IN IT—-WHITNEY 199
VACUUM TUBES

The mere names of modern vacuum-tube applications of electrons
are legion. The kenotron is a vacuum tube which changes high-
voltage alternating current into direct current, and it has its counter-
part for low voltages in the battery-charging tungar rectifier and the
mercury rectifier. The various radiotrons, receivers, and amplifiers
of radio are also the most direct applications of the action of nega-
tive electrons in good vacua. But X-ray tubes must also be con-
sidered in this connection, because X rays are the result of the
“bump,” if you will, of rapidly moving electrons in vacua against
the atoms of matter.

Electrons in motion are also directed and controlled by electro-
magnetic, as well as by electrostatic, fields. Therefore the magnetron
and axiotron have to be included. Because the mere illumination
of such metals as potassium (like the high heating of other metals,
such as platinum and tungsten) causes them to emit electrons, the
photoelectric cell has to be included in our illustrations.

The electrons within the vacuum, as in a radio detector tube, obey
the inconceivably feeble electrical impulses received by the antenna.
Conversely, the motion of electrons sets up impulses and waves in
space. In other words, the vacuum detector may be made a radio
wave generator. Such tubes are used in broadcasting stations.

ETHER WAVES

The wave lengths of the magnetic waves produced by the changes
of motion of the electrons are very long in the case of radio (say
100 to 10,000 feet), millions of times shorter in ordinary light, and
millions of times shorter still in X rays, but they are all in the
same medium and all due to motions of electrons.

SPECIAL EMISSIONS

Finally, to give an impression of the distance such work has gone,
there should also be added the case of a one-atom-deep layer of
thorium on tungsten in a vacuum and its effect on electron emission.

EXPERIMENTS
LAMPS

The first great use of vacuum was in incandescent lamps. If such
a lamp is burned at much higher than its rated voltage, it lasts for
a few minutes only, but it gives a light perhaps five times as efficient
as we usually see. The lamp dies because the tungsten vaporizes or
melts. The vacuum is not at fault. It is because of these limita-
200 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

tions that commercial lamps are so made that they burn at normal
voltages on proper circuits an average of 1,000 hours. If we were
satisfied with a shorter life we could have a more efficient lamp, but
experience has shown that we would be unwilling to use the short-
life lamps in order to secure the added efficiency. To increase the
efficiency without shortening the life of lamps much study has been
made of distillation of metals in vacua, and of methods for return-
ing the distilled metal to the filament. Much has also been done
to make the deposit on the glass invisible or white, so as not to
interfere with light transmission. Naturally we are always on the
lookout for metals, such as the newly discovered hafnium, which
might possibly live longer as a filament than tungsten now lives.
Thirty or forty years of research work had been spent on high-
vacuum incandescent lamps before Doctor Langmuir showed us
how to make still better lamps by putting back into the vacuum.
gases like argon and nitrogen.

DISTILLATION

When the material of a filament distills in vacuum it does not meet
interference to the motion of its molecules, and the distilling sub-
stance proceeds in straight lines from, the heated source. This is
often observed when an incandescent vacuum lamp arcs or burns
out. Metal shadows of interior parts of the lamp are then often
cast onto the walls. This is shown more clearly when a metal like
gold is evaporated from the surface of a tungsten filament in vacuum.
By the interposing of a design, as, for instance, the star in the left-
hand bulb of Plate 1, Figure 1, a shadow in gold is cast on the
glass as shown on the right-hand bulb of Plate 1, Figure'1. This
simple phenomenon is mentioned because it fits in with the kinetic
theory of gases and explains many things observed in vacua. The
“mean free path ” of molecules or atoms is very long in good vacua,
and so straight-line distillation occurs.

HITTORF BULBS

In the historic Hittorf experiment two vacuum bulbs, each carry-
ing an electrode, were joined together by two glass tubes, one very
short and one exceedingly long, as shown in Plate 1, Figure 2.
When electric current was passed from one bulb to the other, it
evidently chose the longer instead of the shorter path, because the
longer tubes became highly luminous, while the shorter one did
not. This is a quality of electrical conduction in vacua where small
quantities of gases still remain, but it can not be gone into here.
THE VACUUM—THERE’S SOMETHING IN IT—WHITNEY 201
EDISON EFFECT

Another experiment shows the historic Edison effect and its rela-
tionship to pure thermionic currents. Where it was once thought that
nearly visible particles of the filament were shot across the space
between filament legs in vacua, now we recognize, in very high
vacua, only the unidirectional motion of negative electrons.

RECTIFIERS

In vacuum tubes like the kenotron these electrons pass from the
hot filament to an electrode commonly called the “ plate.” This pure
emission current is the basis for the so-called rectifiers because only
when the filament is negative does any current flow across the space.
When gases are present greater currents may be carried, because by
the ionization of the gases the moving electrons produce new con-
ductors from the gas molecules. Thus the tungar rectifiers, contain-
ing a little argon, and the older mercury vapor rectifiers involve the
same principle. Without some gas present the negative electrons,
by their very concentration, constitute a space charge which limits
the current. This space charge is removed by the ions produced
within the gas when present.

RADIOTRONS

When we interpose a grid or wire screen between the hot filament
and the plate of the two-electrode tube or rectifier, we have what we
now so commonly use in radio for receiving, for amplifying, and for
production of high-frequency currents. The discovery of the con-
trolling or triggering action of the third or intermediate electrode
was made by De Forest. A negative charge applied to this electrode
or grid interrupts or modifies the electron stream, the current, from
the hot filament to the plate. As it takes almost no energy to charge
this grid (little more than a “token” of energy, or voltage) the
slight power from a radio antenna in its fluctuation may be used to
control or to trigger or to let through corresponding jolts of greater.
energy, which are in turn supplied by some local battery. In the
experiment illustrated in Plate 2, Figure 1, an ordinary incandes-
cent lamp is lighted by current which is passing through a three-
electrode tube from hot filament to plate. Its light indicates this
current. The grid, or antenna wire, is sticking up from the tube so
that it can “ pick up ” electric charges from space. A small negative
charge, produced on a rod of insulating material by merely rubbing
it with a piece of paper, causes the lamp to go out or to light up as
the charged rod is brought near to or removed from the exposed
end of the grid wire.
202 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

MAGNETRON

As the negatively charged grid cuts off the current of the three-
element tube, so an external magnetic field will also do it in the two-
element tube, by so influencing or directing the moving electrons
that they can not reach the plate. Such a device is called a mag-
netron. The particular magnetron used in this experiment, Plate
2, Figure 2, consisting of a cylindrical plate in a vacuum and a
central filament within it, has a coil of wire wound on the outside
of the glass. A feeble current sent through the coil from a battery
may be made to set up within this coil a magnetic field about equal
to that of the earth’s magnetic field, so that by moving the whole
apparatus about in space (thereby at one time adding to the earth’s
field, at others opposing it) the magnitude and direction of the
earth’s magnetic field can be disclosed by a meter which indicates the
resultant current. When the magnetron points toward the north
pole, the meter shows no current, while in other positions currents
are measured. —

AXIOTRON

Another useful vacuum tube of this type is one in which the mag-
netic field of the filament current itself becomes great enough during
each current cycle to deflect the electrons so that they will not reach
the plate. By this tube, “the axiotron,” the frequency of an alter-
nating current may be doubled or direct current be changed into
alternating.

PHOTO-ELECTRIC CELL

Another vacuum tube is the photo-electric cell. As shown in Plate
3, Figure 1, one of these may be connected with a relay to a lamp
so that when light shines upon the cell the burning electric lamp
is extinguished, and relighted on cutting off the light from the
photo-electric cell. In other words, it turns on the lamp when it is
dark and turns it off when it is light. This depends on the fact that
some metals, like potassium, emit electrons when light falls upon
them. These electrons in vacuum constitute a current when they
are made to move by the electrical impulse. To repeat; applying
potential to a vacuum tube having a potassium electrode and an-
other electrode for leading off the current causes current to flow
in the form of negative electrons from the illuminated metal, and
this current actuates the electrical switch which turns off the lighting
current of the burning lamp.

represent a crude “eye” which is connected to a so-called “nerve”
leading to a “brain.” The nerve is merely a long box having elec-
trical capacities and suitable amplifiers or three-electrode tubes
within. The capacities serve to slow down the apparent rate of flow
of the feeble current from the artificial eye so that indicating lamps
along the top of the box or “nerve” light up, one after another, as
the impulse from the “eye” passes along that path, or the nerve.
After the last lamp is thus lighted by these amplified currents an
electric bell rings to indicate reception at the “brain” end of the
circuit. This is not offered as a reliable replica of the real nervous
system, but as an application of the vacuum tube which amplifies
the slight energy available and necesary for the experiment. With
such slight energy it becomes practicable to show the delayed trans-
mission and reception which is necessary for an illustration of
nerve action. Nerve impulses travel much slower than electricity
usually does, and this low speed was one objection to visualizing
nerves as electrical conductors until Crehore and Williams showed
that nerves might be naturally so constructed as to transmit slowly.

xX RAY

In order to show another vacuum product (the X-ray tube) an
effect of X rays may be demonstrated which is not usually thought
of in connection with X rays. Three rubber balloons, suspended
close together by long cords, are first charged electrically by fric-
tion. They then repel each other and stand stationary in space as
at the corners of a large triangle (Plate 3, Figure 3). As soon,
however, as a feeble beam of X rays is projected towards them in the
manner shown in Plate 4, Figure 1, they quickly discharge and fall
to their original position in contact with one another. X rays
ionize air or make it conducting so that the balloons can not re-
tain their mutually repelling charges. This is the basis of a method
for measuring the intensity of beams of X rays.

SPECTRA

Another application of X rays is in the study of internal structure
of crystalline chemical compounds and elements. Cathode rays, cur-
rents of negative ions in vacuum, when speeded up by high voltage,
produce by their impact X rays which are characteristic of the ma-
terial on which they impinge; one may say characteristic of the
mass of the atom of the substance of the target. It is through this
fact that the X-ray spectra of the elements considered as to wave-
lengths are arranged in the same order as the atomic masses in the
periodic table of Mendeleeff, and by this very method the newest
known element, hafnium, has been recently added to the known
204 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

metals. Referring again to our bee analogy, let a fast flying swarm
strike bells so hard that they make them ring. From the sound or
musical notes we guess roughly the sizes of the bells. We could thus
place them in their musical series. The sound corresponds to the
X rays produced when the bees are electrons of cathode rays and
sound waves are ether waves. The mass of the bell is disclosed by
the tone or frequency; the mass of the atom, by the same sign, is
disclosed by the ether wave frequency. When a certain mineral was
used as a surface for the electrons to hit, a new musical note in the
ether was found. It was recorded photographically. Its place in
the scale of elements had been predicted as accurately as middle C
on the piano might have been predicted if it had never been heard.

With higher voltages the velocity of the cathode rays (or elec-
trons) always increases. In the X rays thus far produced, however,
the penetration or transparency is practically limited to about a
quarter of an inch of lead. It is interesting to note that the similar
rays from radium, the so-called gamma rays, can penetrate nearly
a foot of lead. This corresponds to an exceedingly high electro-
motive force. Thus radium rays (gamma rays) might be made in
vacuum X-ray tubes if millions of volts were applied.

ATOM LAYERS

The apparatus shown in Plate 4, Figure 2 (devised by Doctor
Hull) is essentially a two-electrode vacuum tube, the tungsten fila-
ment having a little thorium in it. Ata certain very high tempera-
ture this thorium rapidly diffuses to the filament surface. This
thorium surface then has the peculiar power of emitting electrons a
hundred thousand times as rapidly as pure tungsten at the same
temperature. An ordinary lamp may be lighted in this experiment
by letting this thorium electron-emission current flow through the
lamp filament. The vacuum tube containing the thorium-coated
tungsten also contains a little gas. When the lighted lamp is short
circuited for an instant by a switch, the potential on the vacuum tube
is thereby greatly increased, and this causes positive ion bombard-
ment of the filament and thus tears the thorium all off the tungsten
surface, so that very few electrons are being emitted, that is, those
characteristic of pure tungsten at that temperature. Then the load
(the lamp) can no longer be carried by the electron current. To
repeat, the heavy positively charged gas ions under the impulse of
the raised electrical potential act like a powerful sand blast and
effectively clean the thorium from the tungsten, thus greatly re-
ducing the emission current. By highly reheating the filament for
a few seconds only, a fresh layer of thorium may be diffused to the
surface of the filament from within the tungsten, so that then at the
THE VACUUM—THERE’S SOMETHING IN IT—WHITNEY 205

previous lower temperature the load or lighting current for the lamp
is carried as before by electrons emitted from the thorium sur-
face. This is a proof of the production of a layer of thorium on the
tungsten only one atom deep. The electron current from thor-
ium on tungsten is greater than from pure tungsten, and also than
pure or massive thorium, and is maximum when the single atom
layer is present. This is confirmed by experiments on partial recov-
ery of the surface and supported by thousands of successive repeti-
tions of this experiment on one filament.

HIGH FREQUENCY

By means of an apparatus such as shown in Plate 5, Figure 1, an
ordinary incandescent lamp may be lighted by being brought within
a foot of a coil which is carrying a current of several million cycles.
This, produced by pulsations, is about as near to wireless transmis-
sion of power as anything we now have. This high-frequency prin-
ciple is also being used by Professor Northrup, of Princeton, for
special electric furnaces. In these, the induced currents in the ma-
terial of the crucibles or the material to be heated generate high
temperature through local resistance.

LOUD SPEAKER

Plate 5, Figure 2, shows a loud speaker of unusual design. It
consists of a 26-inch flat conducting disc, in a magnetic field, the vi-
brations of which correspond to the voice currents and reproduce the
sound waves without the intervention of a horn. To operate this
device, vacuum tubes are made use of as follows:

Sound waves entering a microphone cause feeble electromotive
forces to be generated in the microphone. These feeble electromotive
forces are applied to the grid of a pliotron and cause relatively large
variations in the electric current flowing between filament and plate,
which in turn are used to secure larger electromotive forces to be
applied to the grid of another pliotron. By the use of several am-
plifying pliotrons the original feeble electric currents are multiplied
several thousand times and supplied to the loud speaker which repro-
duces the original sounds with many times the original volume and
great faithfulness of quality. To operate this pliotron amplifier re-
quires a direct current of several hundred volts. This may be ob-
tained by first transforming power from the ordinary alternating-
current lighting circuit to a relatively high voltage, next rectifying
this high-voltage alternating current by means of kenotrons, and
finally smoothing out this pulsating current by means of appropriate
electric circuits.
206 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

The high degree of faithfulness of reproduction realized in this
loud speaker is due partly to the absence of a horn, eliminating horn
resonance (one of the usual sources of distortion in a speech repro-
ducer), and partly to the method of vibrating the diaphragm by
forces which are distributed fairly uniformly over its surface, in-
stead of acting upon it in a very limited region, as is the case in most
other loud speakers. This feature eliminates rattling and ringing
of the diaphragm or the production of high overtones by the dia-
phragm vibrating in its partial nodes.
THE USE OF RADIUM IN MEDICINE?

By ANTOINE BECLERE
Member of the Académie de Médicine

Radium kills living tissue. Henri Becquerel accidentally discov-
ered this unsuspected property. As the consequence of carrying a
piece of radium in one of his pockets there developed on his chest
a burn very slow in healing. This chance observation was verified
by Pierre Curie. The latter deliberately placed a piece of radium
on his arm. After allowing it to remain there 10 hours there was
produced a painful sore which required more than four months to
heal.

Pierre and Madame Curie, hoping that this as yet ill-directed
force might become one of benefit, transmitted a little of the precious
substance to a physician of the St. Louis Hospital. The latter care-
fully applied it to the killing of diseased growths of the skin.
Other physicians in France, regulating and improving the technique,
extended these earlier attempts to severer lesions. There thus was
originated in France a new form of medical treatment. It was soon
adopted and investigated in all civilized countries and increased in
importance. Subsequently the curative properties of certain mineral
waters and various mineral muds was traced to the radioactive prop-
erties belonging to them.

This new method of treatment was at first called radiumtherapy.
Later, after other radioactive substances had been discovered, several
of which proved to be of similar value, it received the designation
of Curie-therapy—very appropriately, since on the other side of the
Rhine a treatment making the use of X rays, discovered by the
physicist Réntgen, had been called Réntgen-therapy.

Curie therapy may make use of the more general action of radio-
active substances introduced in various ways in extreme dilution
into the blood stream, but it much oftener uses the more specific
local action resulting from the radiations from substances of which
radium remains the most perfect type. This local action is found

tifique, Feb. 9, 1924.

207
208 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of benefit for a considerable number of diseased conditions of which
the list is doubtless now incomplete. Among these maladies cancer,
because of its seriousness, occupies the most important place and
overshadows all others. How does the radiation from radium act
upon this scourge? The knowledge of its mode of action upon can-
cerous tumors will enable us to understand its effectiveness in the
cases of other tumors and less severe maladies.

Cancer has as yet yielded but a few of its secrets. But we now
know that it is no longer to be looked upon as a fatally hereditary
disease, the appearance and growth of which are so equally certain
that we can only religiously or stoically resign ourselves to a certain
outcome. It is, in the beginning, a local sore, a strictly and exclu-
sively local sore, arising at a single place because of the abnormal,
disordered, anarchic development of a few microscopic cells from
various provocative causes. It is being studied with success in our
research laboratories by means of animal experimentation.

In the first phase as a local sore it is certain that cancer is curable,
perfectly curable. The necessary and sufficient condition for the
cure is the suppression and complete destruction of the cancer cells
already developed at the original focus and in the process of dissemi-
nation into the neighboring tissue.

For the suppression of cancerous tumors there was for a long
time only one known weapon, the knife of the surgeon. We have to
acknowledge that even to-day in many cases it is the best. Surgeons
have cured and will yet cure cancers in great numbers. Their suc-
cesses, formerly exceptional, have been multiplied since Pasteur, by
his immortal discoveries, and Lister, by his applications of them, have
collaborated in the development of a new surgery as audacious and
beneficial in its intervention as the older surgery was timid and
murderous. These successes would be even more numerous were the
recourse to the surgeon not so often too tardy.

To the knife of the surgeon the researches of the physicist have
now added two other weapons: First, the radiation discovered by
Réntgen, and second, radium, but more especially in that complex
radiation from radium made up of three different constituents desig-
nated by the first three letters of the Greek alphabet: the gamma
rays.

The X and the gamma rays are of the same nature. Both possess,
along with the property of passing through all bodies, the power, in
proper doses, of destroying living cells. The gamma rays, besides
being much more penetrating, are also more amenable to very diverse
conditions of treatment. The miniature source, which the least
particle of radium forms, can be inclosed in a small tube or in a
{ine needle of metal like unto a Lilliputian Réntgen tube. Such tubes
may be distributed in greater or smaller numbers close to the skin or
USE OF RADIUM IN MEDICINE—BECLERE 209

inay be introduced into the interior of the natural body cavities.
The needles can even be made to penctrate the diseased tissues.
They are minute but marvelously active and powerful sources of an
invisible radiation.

In these tubes or in these needles can be sealed instead of radium
the gaseous substance or “ emanation” which by a process of atomic
disintegration is a residium from the radiation from radium. The
focus of radioactivity formed by this isolated and imprisoned ema-
nation is not, like radium, an unchanging capital of constant revenue.
but decreases and decreases at such a rate that in less than four days
it loses one-half its original value. Nevertheless its use has certain
advantages.

X rays and gamma rays in strong doses may totally destroy the
living tissues just as do caustics; but in smaller doses they seem to
make a choice, to exercise what may be called a selective action since,
from among the diverse living cells of the exposed region, they kill
some and leave others intact. In reality they make no selection, but
the various cells of our skin, muscles, and nerves are very unequally
sensitive to their destructive action. The reaction of the various
cells to the same dose of the rays is as different as that of various
substances—paper, cloth, woodwork, metals—immersed at the same
temperature in a flame.

Those living cells which are the most sensitive to the rays are as
a rule those which multiply the most rapidly. Such are generally
the cancer cells and consequently they are greatly sensitive to these
radiations. We may look upon the X rays and the gamma rays in
effect as knives or rather invisible darts marvelously tempered and
subtle, capable of riddling with wounds the whole diseased region,
of piercing it without the flowing of blood, without mutilation,
through intact skin, and of killing in an internal organ the cancerous
cells, at the same time leaving alive the neighboring healthy tissues.

The varying chances of success of the treatment, the often insur-
mountable difficulties in its application, and the undeniable dangers
depend essentially upon the degree of difference in the sensitiveness
of the cancerous and the normal cells to the radiations. This differ-
ence, sometimes very great, is oftentimes small, and may entirely dis-
appear. This, leaving aside other obstacles, is the great stumbling
block to the successful treatment with these penetrating radiations.

Radium is therefore not a panacea, applicable to all cancers and
capable of curing a cancer at any stage of its growth. Only under
certain conditions it is an excellent weapon. Its applications, how-
ever, increase as the very delicate technique of its use is improved.

For quite a while the knife has given place to X rays, and for a
somewhat shorter time to radium, in the treatment of superficial
cancers, especially of the face and lips. It is only during the recent
210 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

years that in the case of deeper seated and more rapidly destructive
cancers, much more difficult to treat, radium, aided by improved
technique, has competed successfully with the knife. Such are the
cancers of the tongue, of the mouth, of the throat, of the larynx,
and, that most deplorable of all, cancer of the womb, which, when
it attacks the mother of a family, seems a most cruel penalty of
maternity, making us especially tempted to accuse nature of in-
justice did we not know that her inflexible laws regard neither good
nor evil.

With the last-mentioned series of cancers, in cases where opera-
tions are not possible, radium, well managed, gives not only wonder-
ful improvement, alleviation of suffering, and the prolongation of
life, but also in a very goodly number of instances permanent cures.
Even in cases where operations are possible, according to the most
recent and convincing observations, cures by radium equal or surpass
those with the knife.

Formerly the physician, in the presence of a cancer, could only
ask, Is it or is it not operable? ‘To-day he has to ask a more com-
plex series of questions. Of the three weapons—the knife, the
X rays, and radium—which compose our arsenal against cancer,
which shall he prefer? Shall he employ only one or associate sev-
eral? In the latter case how is it best to combine them? It is a
difficult problem. Doubtless the solution several years hence will
be different from what it would be now. It requires long study in
institutes and special hospitals such as have been for some time
established in almost all civilized countries.

In the country of the discovery of radium and Curie-therapy,
painful as is the avowal, it was not until 1912 that the University of
Paris and the Pasteur Institute, by common accord, decided upon
the founding of an institute of radium. Its two unpretentious
buildings were slowly completed during the recent war. Into their
inert stones Madame Curie put the breath of life by a magnificent
gift which she had agreed upon with Pierre Curie previous to his
death. All the radium extracted from the ores from Bohemia by
their own patience and hands became the property of the new in-
stitute to be used in the jcint work of its two laboratories—the Curie
Laboratory, under the direction of Madame Curie and devoted to
purely scientific physical and chemical researches, and the Pasteur
Laboratory, under the direction of Doctor Regaud, dedicated to bio-
logical researches and the study of the application of radium to
medicine.

Soon afterwards, for the purpose of aiding and supplementing
the inadequate resources of the Radium Institute, there was founded
a new independent institution, the Curie Foundation, recognized as
a public service in 1921, available for all general conventions and
USE OF RADIUM IN MEDICINE—BECLERE 911

having a special endowment. Its purpose is to promote and develop

. by scientific researches of all kinds on radioactive bodies and their

emitted radiations, their application, principally in medicine, but
more especially in the treatment of cancer. Its ambition is to dis-
cover new scientific properties and new methods of treatment for
broadening the scope of Curie-therapy.

Already the Curie Foundation has an offshoot in Canada in the
Radium Institute founded at the University of Montreal by the gov-
ernment of the Province of Quebec. This forges a new bond of
affection in addition to those which already united that country
with France. There is an even better evidence of this bond in the
presence of Professor Gendreau, the Canadian director of this
distant offspring, at the ceremonies for the twenty-fifth anniversary
of the discovery of radium. It is at the Radium Institute in Paris,
in the medical service connected with the Curie Foundation, the first
in France of the institutions for the treatment of cancer, that Curie-
therapy has recently shown its most important progress. This
organization, including a dispensary already a year in service and
officially inaugurated this morning by the Minister of Health, is
from a practical point of view very far from being the equal of some
analogous institutions of other countries. It possesses neither their
wealth of radium nor their magnificent buildings. Its beds, located
at the Pasteur Hospital and the Antoine Chantin medical-surgical
clinic, are scattered and too small in number. It needs a special
hospital, but, as an independent observer has the right to declare,
nowhere can be found greater enthusiasm, ardor, and devotion to
science or a more disinterested and humanitarian spirit than that
which, as exemplified by their chiefs, animates all those associated
in the work.

To Mapame Corte.

Mapame: The discovery of radioactivity and radium, while open-
ing a new world to science, also brings a new domain for the treat-
ment of diseases. When the Academy of Medicine unanimously
elected you to its membership without any request from you, it but
performed a duty in justice and in gratitude. It has the right to be
proud of the glorious name of the first woman elected to its mem-
bership.

Though all minds may not be apt to understand the greatness and
beauty of your conquest in the world of science, what heart is not
moved with admiration and recognition before the new force with
which you have enriched the possibility of lightening human misery,
of triumphing for a while over suffering, disease, and death?

Wherefore your name and that of Pierre Curie will live forever
with all mankind among those of its benefactors.

CLEAR FUSED QUARTZ MADE IN THE ELECTRIC
FURNACE}?

By Epwarp R. Berry, D. Sc.

Thomson Research Laboratory, General Electric Co.

[With 3 plates]
INTRODUCTION

It is the purpose of this article to present some of the recent re-
sults of the development of clear fused quartz and to focus atten-
tion on some of the surprising properties of this material. The art
of making fused quartz dates back to 1839 when Gaudin, in France,
discovered the general thermal properties of fused quartz. A num- ©
ber of advances have been made in the art since that date by various
investigators; but most of this work has been concerned with the
opaque variety of fused quartz usually made from sand. It is only
during the past 23 years that the development of clear fused quartz
has made very rapid progress.

It has been possible for many years to make fused quartz of a
high quality in small sections and lengths by hand labor in the
ordinary blast flame, using gas and oxygen. This has been done by
piecing together small sections of crystal in the flame; or by adding
silica powder from time to time until the piece has grown to the
heating limit of the flame, an obviously slow and expensive process.
From this step in the development of the art to the point where
very large masses of equal quality can be made has been a long and
difficult one. In the last few years the advances made by the process
described in this article have been so rapid and far-reaching that
there seems to be no limit now to the size of high-quality clear fused
quartz which can be made, except that which may be imposed by
mechanical difficulties.

METHOD OF FUSION

When it is desired to obtain fused quartz of the quality which is
illustrated in this article, it is necessary to start with the very

delphia, Apr., 1924. Reprinted by permission from the General Electric Review,
June, 1924.

20397—255——15 213
214 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

highest quality of raw material, of which there is none better than
water clear crystals. It is much more difficult to make fused quartz
of this high quality from sand even if its purity exceed 99 per cent.
The rock crystal used in this work is water clear and contains prob-
ably less than two-tenths of 1 per cent impurities. The surfaces are
often encrusted with iron oxide and other foreign material and the
crystal itself can be seen to contain clusters of small bubbles. The
crystal is therefore washed in acids, and then broken up and the
unsuitable pieces discarded.

There are two distinct steps in the preparation of tubes, rods,
ribbons, and cane; the most important of which is the initial fusion.
The clean quartz crystals, which are of various sizes, are packed as
densely as possible in a graphite or carbon crucible so that during
the cracking of the crystals, which is bound to occur as the tem-
perature is raised, the parts can not separate and allow any small
amount of gas which may be present to enter the many crevices
and thus form bubbles. Those tightly packed crucibles are placed
in a modified vacuum furnace and the temperature raised as quickly
as possible to the melting point. During this fusion the pressure
in the furnace is kept as low as possible. The time required for
fusion will vary with the conditions and in all cases no more than
45 minutes is necessary. The energy rate of fusion is from 38 to 8
kilowatt-hours per pound of quartz, and the loss of quartz due to
volatilization is negligible compared with other charges. The re-
sult of this first fusion is a clear, transparent slug containing com-
paratively few bubbles ranging in size from a pin point to 2 or 3
millimeters in diameter. Whether these bubbles have been formed
by a gas or by silica vapor, it must be remembered that they have
been formed at a temperature of about 1,800° C.; and consequently
their pressure at room temperature is very small. This slug is now
placed in another graphic crucible which is suspended in a vertical
carbon tube furnace. A graphite piston which just fits the crucible
is placed on top of the fused quartz slugs and a weight is placed on
top of a plunger attached to the piston. The slugs are again brought
to fusion, the bubbles are practically collapsed and by the action
of the weight the quartz is extruded in the various forms, such as
rods, tubes, ribbon, etc. This material is practically free from bub-
bles, but because of limiting dimensions it may become necessary
to rework some of this, which is accomplished by the usual bench
methods with an oxygen-illuminating-gas flame.

When it is desired to obtain large blocks as free from bubbles as
the tubing, cane, and ribbon, another operation is necessary. As
before, the quartz is fused in a vacuum furnace which, however, is
also designed to withstand very high pressures. As soon as the
CLEAR FUSED QUARTZ—BERRY 215

material is fused, the vacuum valve is closed and the pressure in
the tank is brought up to some value, depending on the object in
view, in less than a minute. This pressure collapses the bubbles
and makes it possible to obtain very large slugs freer from bubbles
than many kinds of the best optical glass.

Previous attempts to reduce the bubbles by continued heating
above the melting point resulted, after a certain stage, only in ex-
cessive loss of silica by volatilization. We have fused quartz at
initial pressures of 600 pounds per square inch, atmospheric pres-
sure, and less than one-half millimeter of pressure. In the first case
the mass was practically opaque; at atmospheric pressure it was
considerably improved although much inferior to the present quality
of quartz; and under vacuum conditions a large mass can be pro-
duced, which from the standpoint of number of bubbles is very
satisfactory.

Not the least of the difficulties encountered in this development has
been that in connection with the furnace equipment. The vacuum
furnace in particular had to be greatly changed and enlarged with
the result that we now have probably the largest vacuum furnace
in daily use capable of operating at low pressures. Then, in addi-
tion to this, the furnace had to be so constructed as to withstand
repeatedly on the cover a total pressure of over 1,000,000 pounds
(about 600 tons), and of course as the size of the furnace increases
these difficulties are multiplied. Special attention must be paid to
the design of the resistor unit, to the thermal insulation, to even
heat distribution, to the cooling of the terminals, and to the many
other factors which present themselves in the use of these two extremes
in pressure. ;

When the quartz crystal is heated between 500° and 600° C., it
undergoes a remarkable physical change, cracking into small pieces
sometimes with explosive violence. This is due to the difference
of coefficient of expansion along the two axes subjecting the crystal
to great strain, and to the decrepitation caused by the presence of
water and liquid carbon dioxide held in vast numbers of minute
cavities throughout the crystal. The only advantage therefore in
using large crystals for fusing lies in the greater ease of keeping
the charge free from foreign material before the different particles
begin to coalesce.

Hereaus has heated crystal quartz in very small pieces, about the
size of a nut, very slowly so that no cracking occurs and, conse-
quently, no bubbles are included in the vitreous pieces. Hersch-
kowitsch, on the other hand, has arrived at about the same result
by accelerating the heating process so that a film of vitreous mate-
rial is formed on the outside and prevents air from penetrating
216 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

to the center, even though cracks may develop. As a matter of fact
these processes, while interesting, are subject to very sensitive con-
trol and are impractical where large masses are to be fused.

To obtain masses quite free from bubbles, it has been found best
to raise the temperature rapidly to 1,400° or 1,500° C. at which point
the pieces begin to coalesce. At about 1,750° C. the quartz is
thoroughly fused though it is still very viscous. In fact, the vis-
cosity is high even though the temperature be well over 2,000° C.
Vaporization of fused quartz is rapid at 1,600° and at 1,750° C. the
loss due to evaporation is very great. Further increase in tempera-
ture results in no great gain in fluidity.

HOMOGENEITY OF FUSED QUARTZ

The difficulties of obtaining perfectly homogeneous fused quartz
free from striae, strain, bubbles, and double refraction must be ap-
parent to anyone who has worked on this problem, and discouraging
perhaps to those who have tried to buy such material. It is a little
too early to state in what quantities such a product can be produced,
but we have manufactured quartz of this quality which contained
only two or three bubbles visible to the eye. This quality, however,
has not as yet been placed on a commercial basis.

PROPERTIES AND APPLICATIONS OF CLEAR FUSED QUARTZ

The fact that for a great many purposes clear fused quartz can be
used up to 1,000° C. without injury; that its coefficient of thermal
expansion is so small as to make it almost negligible; and that it
will transmit light rays even into the extreme ultra-violet with very
little absorption, gives to it a great utility value—not only to the
scientist but the manufacturer as well.

The specific gravity of clear fused quartz is 2.21. Its coefficient of
thermal expansion is 58 by 10-*, which is about 1/17 that of plati-
num and 1/34 that of copper; so small that a rod of quartz 1 meter
in length will expand only about six-tenths of a millimeter for a
1,000° C. rise in temperature. The small probability of fracture
under sudden changes in temperature because of this property makes
it especially desirable for many uses. Furthermore, where it is used
as a mirror in reflecting telescopes this very small expansion or con-
traction with change in temperature causes almost no distortion of
the image and, consequently, much greater accuracy is made possible.
This property also makes the grinding of a lens or mirror less tedious
and costly, as it is not necessary to await the cooling of the shape in
order to get the desired curve. It is possible to heat a tube of clear
fused quartz, say five-eighths inch in diameter, to the melting point
and plunge it into ice cold water without fracturing.

Its index of refraction for the D line is 1.459, and while its dis-
persion is higher than optical glass it is more constant because of
the smaller effects due to temperature changes. If the rays which
have entered are nearly parallel to a rod of quartz they are totally
reflected internally, and on account of this can pass around curves,
unless too sharp. This property, coupled with a very small absorp-
tion loss, makes it possible to transmit light through very great
lengths of curved rod or tubing with very little loss. A rod of this
fused quartz 1 meter long will emit at one end about 93 per cent of
the total visible light passed into the other end. For the better
grades of optical glass the highest percentage transmitted under the
same conditions is not more than 65 per cent.

he ordinary run of quartz made by this process and used in the
fabrication of quartz mercury-are lamps will transmit light wave
lengths as low as the 1850 A line in the ultra violet. From the oppo-
site end of the spectrum the heat rays also are transmitted with little
loss. For example, if one end of a fused quartz rod 12 inches long is
heated to incandescence, it will be found very uncomfortable to hold
the finger over the other end, although one may comfortably grasp
the rod a few inches from the heated zone.

Clear fused quartz is the only known material which can be ob-
tained in quantity and which is transparent to ultra-violet rays.
The medical profession is consequently utilizing this material more
and more in its application of ultra-violet light for therapeutic
purposes.

By the process here described it is now possible to make tubes, rod,
ribbon, and cane in lengths of 30 feet and in shorter lengths of
diameters up to 8 inches. Blocks have been made up to 1114 inches
in diameter and 6 inches thick having comparatively few bubbles,
and these widely separated, comparable in general appearance to the
best quality of optical glass. Such material is suitable for prisms,
lenses, and for use in instruments where the visible ray is an im-
portant factor.

Constant progress in this development is being made, and it is
hoped that perfect homogeneity can be made the rule rather than
the exception. It is expected that for most optical work this quality
of the present material will be entirely satisfactory.

PROJECTION LENSES

Fused quartz lenses of 414 inches diameter have been for several
months very successfully operated on test in motion-picture projec-

_tion machines, using currents as high as 150 amperes and where glass

lenses cracked almost daily.

THERMOMETERS

It is well known that in the ordinary glass thermometers there is
an appreciable lag in the glass, so that successive readings in a de-
scending scale are inaccurate. To test the extent of this we have
placed a standard glass thermometer and a quartz thermometer of
our own construction in the same bath and raised the temperature
to 515° C. and then lowered it again to 0° C. In this particular
case the mercury in the glass came back to four divisions below the
zero mark, whereas the mercury in the quartz returned exactly to its
original calibrated mark at zero. While the capillary in the quartz
tubing is not exactly uniform throughout its entire length, it is so
uniform that a calibration of the tube over its whole length would
eliminate any inaccuracies due to the slight nonuniformity.

TUNING FORKS

As a standard of pitch the tuning fork is about the only appliance
in use. Temperature changes affect the pitch of the hardened steel
fork, however; and, what is more important, the work which has to
be done in adjusting these steel forks to the desired pitch by grind-
ing or otherwise working them, results in changes in elasticity and
dimensions that cause a disturbance of the pitch note. A tuning
fork of quartz is not subject to these changes to any appreciable
degree.

This work has all been carried on in the research laboratory of the
General Electric Co. at Lynn, and in presenting this description the
author wishes to express his appreciation of the efforts of Mr. L. B.
Miller and Mr. P. K. Devers, who in a large measure were respon-
sible for the good results obtained.

THE DRIFTING OF THE CONTINENTS?
By PIERRE TERMIER

Nothing concerning the seas or their history should fail to inter-
est you. The structure? we now occupy is a kind of temple erected
by an enthusiastic mariner to the glory of the ocean which he had
made his god; therefore, all the echoes from the mighty roar of
waves past and present should converge here. Yes; even from the
past, the most distant past; the dashing of waves breaking on
shores which in no way resemble our own; the roll of waters which
divide an instant to engulph some great island, as fabulous Atlantis,
or some bit of continent, and close again with a lazy indifference
over so many swallowed-up treasures; the roar of the terrible tidal
wave, the ¢swnamis of our Japanese brothers, which has caused agita-
tion, undulation and trembling from the depths of the sea, and
which has rushed to the assault of the continental domain, overturn-
ing all, leveling all, mowing down the terrestrial life and its work
of a day; subterranean sounds from unfathomable depths, scarcely
to be perceived, while listening to the importunate murmur of living
beings and flying meteors, and which are the sighs of the earth in
travail, of the earth incessantly deformed, increasing or diminish-
ing its oceanic areas, folding the bott 1 of its seas, elevating it,
after having folded it, then raising it above the waters as if to menace
the heavens, and sometimes, after having thus elevated it, dragging
it back into the marine depths lower than before. Sound, indeed,
who knows? A sound almost imperceptible, so slight, so little dif-
ferent from silence itself, of continents en marche, which slowly, oh
very slowly, as great pontoons floating on the calm waters of a port,
or as giant icebergs borne by the polar es are drifting toward
the Equator.

This is the very question we are going to consider this evening:
Are the continents absolutely fixed; the one in relation to the others
and all in relation to the profound depths? Are they really terra
firma, as the sailors say when, worn out by the rolling and pitching
from the depths of a monsoon, they dream of the old iron ring on
the sun-flooded quay? Are the outlines of the seas on the surface of
the planet invariable?

Let us suppose an observer without sense of time, indifferent to its
duration, for whom a thousand years are as a day, were placed be-
yond the earth, for example, at the distance of the moon, contem-

plating the full earth, “round and shining” in the midst of black
space. Would this observer always have under his eyes an orbit of
the same aspect, as a child learning geography turns in his hands one
of those globes prepared for teaching and finds again and again be-
fore him the same contours and the same colors?

Would this observer always see the same America extending from
north to south, gradually contracting from top to bottom, divided
in two parts by a large indentation, the lesser being strongly re-
fracted toward the east? Would he always see the same mass—
Kurope, Asia, the Eurasia of Edward Suess, extending parallel to
the Equator and broken by long and high mountain chains; then,
separated from Eurasia by a zone of indentations, the Mediterranean,
the Red Sea, the seas of the Malay Archipelago with their numerous
islands, two other great masses, Africa and Australia, which re-
semble each other in their massive form and simple contour with
their blunt southern terminations, Australia having Tasmania, a
blunt point to the south, and both refracted toward the east in their
southern portions after the manner of America? Would he always
see between these two great continental systems the same oceans,
stretehing out infinitely toward the south, narrowed and almost
closed toward the north? Would there be the same islands—islands
on the eastern side of Asia, arranged in garlands parallel to the
curve of the coast; islands of Oceania in long archipelagoes which
have the form of arcs and which seem from afar like light strokes
of the brush on the immense and monotonous painting of the Pacific?
The Sunda Islands extending along Asia, first in a regular and or-
derly fashion and then mixed as in a kind of whirlpool in the Celebes
and the Molucca Seas, finally becoming united at the north of New
Guinea, with one of the insular arcs of Oceania; the Antilles form-
ing a semicircle open to the west; the islands of the extreme south
of South America presenting also this arrangement, a semicircle
open to the west, a semicircle whose diameter, extending from north
to south, reaches from Cape Horn to the South Pole? Has there
been for a million years the same geography? Or, indeed, if our
observer fell asleep for a moment, if he closed his eyes for some
dozens of millions of years, would he have been surprised on awaken-
ing to find before his eyes a new and rejuvenated earth, continents
with other outlines, different mountains, seas which he did not know,
conditions in short which give this suppositional being the sensa-
tion of having been inattentive, a feeling of progress, of change, in a
word, a sense of time which was before lacking in him?

All geologists, without hesitation, would respond to a question
put in these general terms, that the face of the earth is not unchange-
able. All teach that the outlines of the seas vary; that the continents
are terra firma only in appearance; that they are rooted perhaps, but
THE DRIFTING OF THE CONTINENTS—TERMIER PAH

that their roots, flexible and elastic, permit them near the surface
to draw nearer to each other; that the oceanic space included be-
tween two continents can therefore contract much, for example, from
a half to two-thirds of its original width, and then this space, for-
merly the sea, becomes a line of folds, a mountain chain which will

dominate superbly the continents thus brought nearer together.
- Geologists differ only in their interpretation of the extent of these
phenomena and in the manner of accounting for them.

Yes; geography is variable. We have known that for a long
time. It varies at first a little, very little, I mean to say very
slowly, under the action of two powerful leveling agencies—erosion
and sedimentation, which tend to equalize the surface of the earth
and to establish there the universal ocean, the Panthalassé of Ed-
ward Suess—erosion which disaggregates, wears away, dissolves,
rounds off, modifies the mountains and very slowly transforms them
into a peneplain; sedimentation which fills the lake basins and tends
to diminish the depth of the seas. But geography changes espe-
cially by the peculiar movements of the planet which I call its
convulsions. These movements are of two kinds, vertical and
tangential. The vertical movements displace the shore lines, cause
the sea to advance on the continental domain or recede, rejuvenate
the monotonous peneplains and worn-down mountains, deeply em-
bank the rivers; elevate or depress the high chains and thus in turn
increase and lengthen or diminish the glaciers; raise new moun-
tains or plunge beneath the sea portions of continents, vast islands,
or entire formations of a formerly majestic mountain chain. They
change the conditions of life and of sedimentation at the bot-
tom of the sea by changing the depth and the remoteness of the
shore.

These vertical movements are some thousands of meters in extent.
They have the singular double character of being oscillatory and at
any time counterbalancing each other so nearly that the mean level
of the seas does not greatly change. While certain points of the
surface rise some thousands of meters and others sink simultaneously
a comparable amount, the mean level of the sea in comparison
with the supposedly fixed mean level of the continents varies only
a few hundred meters.

The tangential movements are those which wrinkle the surface of
the earth, transforming an entire section of the surface into a sys-
tem of folds, which needs only elevation to become a chain of moun-
tains. The extent of the tangential movements is indeed far greater
than that of the vertical; for a particular chain it is some hundreds
of kilometers, if indeed it does not attain to a thousand. The chain
of the Alps, for example, whose width, to-day, scarcely exceeds

250 kilometers, resulting from the contraction of an elongated zone
20397—25——_16
222 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

for a long while occupied by the sea, was formerly at least 800
kilometers wide, perhaps a thousand. The southern margin of this
zone has approached the northern margin, and the sediments ac-
cumulated on the bottom of this elongated sea have been folded
and even refolded upon each other. If, instead of the Alps, we con-
sider the entire system of the great chains of central Asia which is .
actually 3,000 kilometers from north to south, we are led to con-
clude that the transverse sea roughly parallel to the Equator, was
formerly at the very least 6,000 kilometers in width for, in this sea
which the geologists call Tethys were deposited the sediments which
constitute the major part of these chains. It was a sort of trans-
verse Atlantic; it has gradually narrowed by the contraction of its
margins, a contraction which has proceeded without doubt by suc-
cessive abrupt movements, whose total extent embraced eight or nine
of our geological periods, that is to say several hundreds of millions
of years. Such is the common teaching of geologists on the defor-
mation of the surface of the earth; and you see that they all play a
large part in the variations of geography and in the mobility of the
lithosphere.

But very recently, in 1912, a German geophysicist, Alfred
Wegener, conceived the idea of a very much greater mobility. He
uprooted the continents and compared them to pontoons floating
to a port, of which I was just speaking, or, better still, to those ice-
bergs which each spring are born by the breaking up of the polar
ice flow and, carried away by the polar currents, pass toward the
temperate regions of the ocean, a white flotilla dreaded by navi-
gators. These mountains of ice drift with a speed varying slightly
according to their form and dimensions, and the inequality of their
progress soon exaggerates the distance which separates them. The
same thing occurs with the continents. Here, for example, is the
Kurope-Asia-Africa mass; it was united formerly to the American
mass, and there can still be seen on both sides of the Atlantic an
undeniable similarity in the outline of the shores. Between these
masses, which were formerly one, a fissure opened which gradually
enlarged, because, in the general drifting toward the west, the
American mass moved more rapidly than ours; and this fissure,
to-day from 2,000 to 6,000 kilometers in width, is the Atlantic.
Wegener thinks America broke away from us; perhaps we shall
never overtake her.

The chains of islands bear witness to the movement of the conti-
nents. ‘The islands are comparable to the small icebergs which break
off on the edges from the great mountains of ice and remain behind,
being more retarded in the intervening waters on account of their
small sizes. The islands form a group of stragglers behind a con-
tinent which advances. Consider the insular ares of eastern Asia,

THE DRIFTING OF THE CONTINENTS—TERMIER ap

the Aleutian Islands, the peninsula of Kamchatka, Kurile, Sakhalin,
Japan, Liu-Kiu, Formosa, Philippines, and Borneo; are not these
fragments of the Asiatic coast detached nearly simultaneously and
showing, by their arrangement in garlands parallel to the outlines
of the shores, that they formerly belonged to them? And the chain
Sumatra, Java, Sumbawa, Flores, Timor, what is it, except a
truncated extension of this tail of Asia, the Malay Peninsula? The
sections of the Asiatic tail follow the general movement of Asia but
with a slight retardation. What are the Antilles if not fragments
large and small of Central America left behind, the little ones more
retarded than the large ones and forming a flotilla whose center
advances less rapidly than its wings and which incurves thus in form
of a semicircle open to the west? And what do we see at the
southern extremity of South America? The point of the continent
twisted toward the east, twisted at right angles, then at Cape Horn,
and in Staten Island abruptly broken; but a little further to the
east there are the remains of this point—South Georgia, South Shet-
land, South Orkney, Sandwich Group, all one series of wreckage,
outlining another incurved flotilla whose left wing almost touches
the point of the Antarctic, which point twists toward the east, as
does the American point which faces it across Drake Strait. Does
not this disposition in semicircles of the two points and of the
archipelagoes cause one to vision the rupture of an old bridge which
should have joined the Antarctic to South America and which,
being without doubt too thin to resist the thrust of the marine
depths opposed to its drifting toward the west, would have twisted
its two abutments, and not being able to rest entirely coherent after
twisting, would have broken in disjointed groups of scattered masses ?

Finally, let us consider Australia. Above is New Guinea, which
seems to be only a detached portion; above and to the right of
New Guinea a whole chain of islands, which curve toward the south
parallel to the Australian coast including New Caledonia and far-
ther New Zealand. Does it not seem to you that this chain of islands
joins from the north of New Guinea to that of the Malay Archi-
pelago which I called, a minute ago, the truncated tail of Asia?
The joining takes place in the region of the Molluca and the Celebes,
where the archipelagoes twist around confusedly. But would not
this twisting be due to the advance from south to north of the
enormous mass of New Guinea-Australia? Would not these sec-
tions of the Asiatic tail formerly extending toward the southeast,
as Sumatra, have been deviated toward the north by the drifting
of Australia? Their flotilla, formerly regular as a well-conducted
squadron, would it not have been dislocated and dispersed by the
prow of New Guinea advancing and does not this flotilla, extending
further the direction of its route and simply bent by the moving
224 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

obstacle, again outline on the Pacific the regular are ending at New
Zealand? To these questions of Wegener I confess I have often been
tempted to respond in the affirmative.

But Wegener goes further still, so far that one hesitates to follow
him. He does not hesitate to attribute to the resistance of the deep
fluid interior on which the continents float and in the interior of
which they are plunged, of attributing, I say, to this resistance, the
tangential movements which have folded the lithosphere and fash-
ioned the mountain chains. The long chain which dominates the
western shore of America, the Rocky Mountains and the Andes,
would result, according to him, in the marginal folding of the
border which serves as prow to the immense ship while it drifts
toward the west. Perhaps it might be thus for any long chain;
it would indicate the direction and, on careful consideration,
the trend of the ancient continental drift. Australia would for-
merly have moved toward the east before advancing toward the
North; Africa would have had, at a very remote epoch, at the end of
the Primary, a rapid movement of drifting toward the south, to
which the mountain chain of the Cape bears witness.

Such a theory has the possibility of being extremely convenient,
an advantage which is not without grave danger, the danger of
making superficial minds believe that enigmas are solved when they
are simply displaced and replaced by those more general and much
more irresolvable. Yes, it may seem very convenient to unite two
continents cr to separate them at will; to join them to explain the
migration of the fauna and flora from one to the other, or the ex-
tension from one to another of some line of structure, for example,
a chain of mountains; then separate them to explain on another oc-
casion the dissimilarity of biological conditions that one observes
there, or the difference which manifests itself in the geological
history of two continents during an indefinite period of time. It is
also very convenient to admit, with regard to the continents, that the
terrestrial poles could shift. This, by a stroke of the pen, does away
with all difficulty relating to the distribution of climate during the
different geological periods. And if you are adverse to the idea that
the axis of the earth may be movable, you will be told that this
mobility is not all necessary; it is sufficient, the poles remaining
fixed, to have the continents glide around the globe. By means of
this gliding you may construct at any moment the geography which
seems to you most in accordance with the image which you have of
the face of the earth in keeping with the geological data at the same
moment of its duration.

Here is a characteristic example of this extraordinary and very
seductive convenience. Toward the end of the Carboniferous period,
svhen coal was being formed in many parts of the globe by the

THE DRIFTING OF THE CONTINENTS—TERMIER 225

accumulation of vegetable remains in the lakes, ponds, bogs, and
lagoons, geological observation reveals to us that there were wide
differences between two vast regions of the earth’s surface—bio-
logical differences and climatic differences. The first region em-
braced central and southern Europe, central Asia, extending to the
south as far as the northern border of Hindustan, and then North
America between the Great Lakes and Texas. In this region the
immense coal basins had just been filled and the others were still on
the point of filling up; the vegetation was incredibly luxuriant;
never at any other point of geological history had the vegetable
kingdom known such exuberance. This vegetation was everywhere
as varied as possible, considering the state of development which the
world of plants had then attained, the plants of the American coal
measures, for example, being the same as the Franco-Belgian or the
Chinese. From the exuberance of the flora and also from the char-
acter of the fauna one is led to believe that everywhere the region in
question enjoyed a very warm climate; nowhere so far has there been
found the least manifestation of glaciation. A second region pre-
sented itself, entirely different, separated from the first by a trans-
verse sea which extended from the actual position of Central Amer-
ica and that of the islands of the Malay Archipelago, passing by the
north of Africa and the north of Hindustan, thus forming a belt
halfway around the earth. The separation brought about by this
sea was an effectual one, for in the region of which I now speak,
and which extends south of this sea, grew a flora plainly and almost
totally different from that of the first region. The second flora was
much less luxuriant, much less varied; it offered to a very high
degree the characteristics of monotony and poverty which belong to
a country relatively cold. A plant group dominated there, the
species Glossopteris, which is a fossil species of Fougere (fern), and
one often speaks of the Glossopteris tlora, Glossopteris region,
Glossopteris period, to designate by a word those biological condi-
tions, the region where they dominated, and the very long epoch
during which they lasted. The Glossopteris flora was the same, or
nearly the same, in the whole continental domain, which extended
to the south of the transverse sea. It was very vast, since it
included Hindustan, Australia, Tasmania, Transvaal, the whole
great African area north of Transvaal, Brazil, and in the south
extended as far as the distant Falkland Archipelago. And, a very
important fact, over the enormous spaces of this continental domain
there had been during the time of the Glossopteris flora manifesta-
tions of glaciation. Almost everywhere tlie first coal measures rest
on a very extensive moraine; at certain points one ascertains the
superposition of many moraines separated by coal measures. Thus the:
glaciers have advanced on the Glossopteris region as much in Hindu-
226 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

stan as in Tasmania, as much in the Falklands as in the Transvaal;
and this glacial episode, many times repeated, seems to have been
as important and as general, even if not more so, than the great
glacial invasions of the north during the quarternary period.

All this is very difficult to explain and very embarrassing to the
geologist. One has dreamed of the displacement of the poles and
attempted to place the South Pole in the Indian Ocean not very far
from the Cape of Good Hope to account for the cold climate and
the glacial invasions. But then two obstacles are encountered: First,
as there is a difference of nearly 70° of latitude between the Cape
of Good Hope and the northern border of Hindustan, at the foot of
the Himalayas, it is necessary to carry the glaciers which came from
the South Pole even within 20° of the Equator; further, the North
Pole, antipode of the South Pole, would then fall in Mexico or in
the Rocky Mountains, in a country where the deposits of the Upper
Carboniferous are of calcereous Fusulina—that is to say, sediments
formed in a warm, not polar, sea.

With the theory of Wegener 2verything arranges itself, and there
is no more difficulty. Let us suppose that in the Carboniferous the
African mass may be joined to the Brazil, that the Hindustan may
even be joined to the African mass, the southern point of Hindustan
coming to attach itself to the east coast of Madagascar, and Mada-
gascar being itself attached to the African coast; that Australia may
come to aggregate itself also to this mass by joining its west coast
to the east coast of Hindustan. There is thus a great southern con-
tinental mass, which a transverse sea, the Tethys, separates from
another, the northern mass thus uniting again North America to
the north of Eurasia. By simply gliding let us displace on the
globe the two masses and Tethys, with regard to the supposedly
fixed axis of the earth. Let us arrest this movement in such a man-
ner that the South Pole may be in what is to-day the Indian Ocean,
not far from the region where we have made Australia, Hindustan,
Madagascar, and Africa come together; all this region becomes polar
antarctic, and it is therefore quite natural that the climate there
should be rigorous and promote glacial invasions. At the same time
the North Pole falls no longer in the Rocky Mountains, but in the
open Pacific, on account of the union of North America and of
Eurasia—that is to say, in a region whose geographic and geologic
conditions during the Carboniferous period are totally unknown to
us. Finally, and this is the most seductive part of the hypothesis,
the coal basins of the Tethys and of the northern border of the
Tethys, those of China, southern Siberia, southern Russia, Poland,
Germany, Belgium, France, Great Britain, Canada, and the United
States are all either on the Equator or within less than 30° of north
latitude. One, then, can understand the warm climate which reigns

——— ee
THE DRIFTING OF THE CONTINENTS—TERMIER 92%

everywhere with the same exuberance and variety of vegetation
which covers them. It is admirable; but in order not to be misled it
is necessary to remember what I said a moment ago of the danger of
these very convenient hypotheses which make appeal to occult forces,
perhaps inexistent, and which afford us the formidable power of dis-
posing at will of the continents and seas.

Such is Wegener’s theory of the drifting of the continents, with
its undeniable attractions and deceptive power, probably mislead-
ing. It was received with very great enthusiasm, at first, especially
among geophysicists and in Germany. The inconsistency came
later. It is a curious thing that, in spite of the latitude which this
theory gives to geologists, there are those amongst them who have
been unwilling to accept it and are the ones who have raised the
strongest objections. Let us consider the matter a little more closely.

What could be this fluid magma on which the continents float and
in which their bases are immersed? According to Wegener, it is a
bath of melted rock having almost the composition of the heaviest
lavas emitted by our volcanoes. You know that lavas vary from one
volcano to another and sometimes even in the same volcano from one
eruption to another. There is a whole gamut of lavas, the lightest
of which, richest in silica and oxygen, when solidified are of the
lightest color and have very nearly the chemical composition of
granite, while the heaviest, the most basic, charged with magnesia
and iron, have a much darker color and are even at times entirely
black; these are called basalts. From one extremity to the other
of this gamut the density of the lava, supposedly solidified and com-
pletely crystallized, varies in round numbers from 2.8 to 3. It is
a very remarkable fact that the gamut of lavas has not changed
since the most distant geological epochs of which we have any
knowledge. Even in pre-Cambrian times, probably already when
life began, there were volcanoes which ejected lavas in every way
resembling those of the Tertiary volcanoes, some that are called
rhyolites, having the chemical composition of granite, others that
were basalts, identical with our basalts, and a series of others of
intermediate composition. Hence the idea that there is all around
our globe, under the solid crust, or lithosphere, a liquid spherical
zone, or pyrosphere, from which the volcanoes have always been
and still are supplied; that, since the beginning of geological time,
the mean limit of the lithosphere and the pyrosphere have not sensi-
bly varied; that, periodically, but with a periodicity unknown, on
a vertical scale this limit rises or descends, but without exceeding a
maximum value, neither does it descend below the minimum value
of its distance to the center of the globe. On the other hand, all
the geophysical data make us believe that, in the interior of the
earth the elements are classed, at least approximately, in the order
228 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of their increasing density from the periphery to the center. The
zone next to the surface is formed of light rocks such as granite,
rich in silica, oxygen, and aluminium; it is the salique zone or the sal
(Si, Al) of Edward Suess. Lower, silica, oxygen, and aluminium
diminish, while calcium, iron, and magnesia increase; it is the zone
simique or the sima (Si, Mg) of Edward Suess. Lower still, there
is little but iron, with some other metals, such as nickel; Edward
Suess called this zone nifique or the nifé (Ni, Fe). The probability
is that the series of the mingling of the elements may be continuous,
and that there may be no precise demarcation between sal and sea,
between sima and nifé. The same holds for the physical conditions.
Under the solid lithosphere there is the liquid pyrosphere; under
the latter, what is the physical condition of the deep interior which
becomes little by little nifique in its composition? Is it a solid? Is
it a gas? We do not know, and we content ourselves with calling
this interior the barysphere. The probability is that there may be
a continuous gradation from the solid of the lithosphere to the
liquid of the pyrosphere, and also from the liquid of the pyro-
sphere to the unknown physical condition which is that of the bary-
sphere. It is not, however, absolutely impossible that there may be
some discontinuities, especially in the series of the physical condi-
tions; but, if such, they elude us, of course, at every conjecture.

To uproot the continents and render them mobile, Wegener sup-
poses the existence of such discontinuities; he supposes that the sep-
aration of the sal and sima is clearly marked. The sal forms the
continents; they are entirely solid. The séma under them is entirely
liquid, without the viscous transition between liquid and solid; under
the oceans there is only séma, at first a very thin pellicle of solidi-
fied sima, then, under that, the general bath of molten séma.
Wegener admits that the sal, of which the continents are formed, is
a solid having a mean density 2.8; he admits, on the other hand,
that the liquid sima has a mean density of 2.9. A piece of continent,
a fragment of sal, floating on a simique bath, will be deeply sub-
merged in it, after the manner of mountains of ice which float on
the sea, whose submerged depth is very much greater than their visible
height; for the fragment of continent, the submerged depth will be
about nineteen times the emerged height. As there is a difference
of nearly 5 kilometers between the mean distance to the center of
the earth of the continental domain and the submarine domain con-
stituted by the bottom of the oceans, it is necessary, says Wegener,
that the continents be submerged some 95 kilometers in the liquid
sima. |

Can you conceive of this strange earth? Around her a spherical
liquid envelope, formed of lava, which if it became solidified would
be analogous to basalt; this lava is not only liquid, but very mobile,

—— a
THE DRIFTING OF THE CONTINENTS—TERMIER 929

almost like water; on the spherical liquid envelope are placed the
oceans, separated from the molten bath by a very thin pellicle of
basalt, just sufficient to assure the separation and not to be broken at
any moment under the action of the tides; in the remainder of the
bath are submerged the continents, composed of solid sad, immersed
as much as 95 kilometers deeper than the suboceanic pellicle. Rising
above this pellicle there are only some kilometers of hard rocks
which dominate for some hundreds of meters the level of the seas.

And here is that which shakes and displaces all. A continent
advances, like an enormous ship. The simique pellicle which makes
the bottom of the oceans gives way before it, powerless to imprison
it. As the steam in the polar seas breaks victoriously in the morning
under its beam the young ice formed during the night, which tries
to make it captive, the continent advances, under the power of one
knows not what, an irresistible force. But the reaction of the sur-
rounding sima restrains it; restrains it so much that it folds margin-
ally this margin which descends a hundred kilometers below the sur-
face, and this folding of the profound depths, extends as far as the
upper limit of the vast mass, and causes there an assemblage of
folds, a chain of mountains. Again, in the couse of the drifting,
the mass breaks by a narrow fissure, the underlying sma gushes
forth, some basaltic volcanoes open and fiame; then the fissure
enlarges, the sea penetrates it; this will form later, perhaps, a new
ocean; or else it may only be a momentary breaking of the two
borders which will be brought together again and join themselves
anew. In the meantime, behind the advancing continent, some
islands originate from the crumbling of its long and fragile stern -
they will be retarded in the simique pellicle continually reforming
around it; the flotillas of islands, which will follow from afar, with
the gentle undulations of a scarf agitated by the wind, or the brusque
unexpected arrival of another immense vessel, of another continent
advancing, will throw it in confusion and cause it to whirl tu-
multuously. Confess that the vision is magnificent. I see it often
before my eyes and never without inward enjoyment, as if I were
seeing a very beautiful work of art.

If it is true that the stma forms the very bottom of the oceans,
while under the continents it is held at a much greater depth, one
should find that gravity is greater in the oceanic domain than in
the continental; in this latter domain it should be less in proportion
as the country is more mountainous for the Archimedian equilibrium.
the isostasy, as they say, demands that the more elevated the surface
of the continent is the more deeply it descends in the stma. This is
in fact what one ascertains from the laws of gravity. The adherents
of the theory argue from that; but they would be wrong to believe
that the argument is decisive. One can, indeed, explain the diminu-
230 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

tion of gravity in mountainous countries by noting that in the
mountains and under them the parts of the lithosphere nearest to
the surface, and hence the lightest, are folded and heaped on them-
selves and thus they have driven back toward the depths the denser
lower zones. One can also contend that the differences of gravity
are original; that the lithosphere is not and never has been homo-
geneous; that the oceans installed themselves, from the beginning,
over the densest regions, which correspond to the depressions of the
surface; that the continents are the less dense regions; and that this
primitive distribution of relief has hardly changed up to our time.
The consideration of the inequalities of gravity does not solve, then,
the question of whether the continents can drift widely or whether
they have been anchored for a long while; since on the earth, which
had just cooled, the seas were formed and circumscribed.

In the theory of Wegener as the author presents it to us, there are
numerous and strong improbabilities. The whole is seductive; many
of the details are startling. I do not speak of the fundamental con-
ception, little probable, little satisfying, of the existence of the
physical and chemical discontinuities in the interior of the earth.
But who could believe, for example, in the formation of mountain
chains by the reaction of the liquid séma on the advancing continent ?
If the sima is capable of opposing such a resistance to the movement
of the floating mass, how is it that this mass is not held by the sima
and how can it move? In the hypothesis of mobility, what becomes
of the débris of the solid simique pellicle which forms the bottom of
the ocean? Should it not accumulate in a thick fold of dark heavy
rocks under the prow of the great ship? But nothing resembling it
appears. How can the deep foldings of the solid continental sad,
under the thrust of the liquid sima, transform itself in rising toward
the surface and form these folds and beds that we see in our moun-
tains and which suggest the idea of superficial wrinkles much more
than that of a very deep seated disturbance propagated in a vertical
direction.

Supposing that one could accept Wegener’s orogenic hypothesis
for the Cordilleras of western America, or south Africa, or eastern
Australia, it would be necessary to find another to explain the Alps,
the Apenines, the Caucasus, the great chains of Central Asia. This
is indeed what Wegener tries to do; but who is the tectonician who
would consent to accepting two entirely different orogeneses, one
for the Andean pile and those resembling it, another for the im-
mense transverse chains which are the highest summits of our world
and which have replaced the ancient Tethys? How believe that
under the oceans the basalt magma may have a density of 2.9 and that
it may still have the same density under the continents at a very
much greater depth, 95 kilometers greater ?

THE DRIFTING OF THE CONTINENTS—TERMIER 9381

Note that 2.9, or rather 3, is the density of solid and crystallized
basalt at the surface of the globe; the density at this same surface
of fluid basalt, of flowing basaltic lava, is indeed less; and the den-
sity of this basaltic fluid certainly varies with the pressure to an
extent unknown. So that the calculation of the ratio of the plunged
and submerged depths of sal seems a little illusory. How to admit
finally that in a bath of séma of such mobility, in a bath where the
ereat blocks of sal float and drift, the tides determined by solar and
lunar attraction may not be sufficiently energetic to break each day
the thin pellicle which separates the molten s¢ma from the oceanic
waters? For it is indeed necessary that this pellicle be very thin,
otherwise it would imprison forever the continents it incloses.

But in the matter of geological hypothesis the improbabilities do
not count. They do not prove that a theory may be radically
false; they simply show that it needs to be ameliorated, corrected,
accurately stated. If one does not accept the theory of Wegener,
it is not because there are others fully satisfactory. Thus far none
has been proposed which does not also show some striking im-
probabilities. Between these theories, which displace the enigmas
without solving them, we choose according to our tastes and tem-
peraments, some finding acceptable those which others declare
absurd, unless we should prefer to take refuge in a kind of scientific
agnosticism. In truth there are geological phenomena themselves
astonishing and improbable, of the existence of which one is entirely
certain. How, henceforth, expect to explain them? We know
that the lithosphere moves, that its movements have periodic returns,
that certain of them are oscillatory; we also know, or think we do,
the extent of their amplitude. That is all. Of the profound causes
of this mobility, of the manner in which the movements begin,
progress, and cease, we know nothing.

To ameliorate Wegener’s theory and render it lasting, to do away
with the gross improbabilities of which I have spoken, we can trust
to the geo-physicists. They will conceive by new hypotheses other
details of the “machine,” as Pascal remarks, details which perhaps
will not be more correct than the first and which, in any case,
will not be more possible of verification.

Some days ago, in a communication which I had the pleasure of
presenting to the Academy of Sciences, my excellent friend, Emile
Belot, with whose original and bold ideas you are acquainted and
whose cosmogonic theory has interested Henri Poincaré himself,
recalled that, long before Wegener, he had attempted to explain in
an entirely different manner the genesis of the continents and the
oceans; and he showed how his own theory accounted for the
original grouping of the continents in a single mass, a grouping
232 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

which Wegener supposes but does not explain, and how this same
theory accounted for the displacement of the continental masses,
which one searches for in vain in the German theory. But there
are many hypotheses in the theory of Emile Belot; there is, above
all, the hypothesis of the transport of the earth at an enormous
speed to the midst of a tranquil nebula, “transport en projectile,”
which the author uses with admirable ingenuity. This furnished
him with an exterior force, the resistance from the nebula, which
he called “the wind of the nebula.” As the earth, in the hypothesis
of Belot, travels in a direction parallel to its axis, the North Pole
forward, the two poles are very unequally swept by this nebula
wind. When the deluge of the primoidial waters fall on the slightly
cooled earth it will take the form of frightful squalls, generators
of the most frightful torrents, capable of sculpturing the soft crust;
these torrents accumulate the sal at the North Pole and, on the
other hand, denude the sta at the South Pole; they hollow out pro-
foundly the bed of the oceans and will give to the continents their
definite pointed form toward the south. It is further, the wind of
the nebula which, by retarding the terrestrial rotation, very un-
equally, according to the latitude and very differently in the two
hemispheres, furnished Emile Belot an explanation of the twisting
of the continents toward the east and, in a general way, that of the
tangential displacements parallel to the Equator. As to the tan-
gential displacements parallel to the meridians, the author explains
them by means of a new hypothesis—the hypothesis of the periodic
fall on the earth of many satellites in annular form, analogous to
the rings of Saturn. Thus ingeniously everything is accounted for
and it is surely a very amusing effort, but it can not be proved.

Very recently, also, an English scientist, J. Joly, gave his inter-
pretation of the theory of the drifting of the continents, making
appeal to radioactivity to supplement the German thesis, thus mak-
ing it capable of explaining a greater number of phenomena. Joly
admits, as does Wegener, the existence of a spherical envelope of
basalt all around the globe, under the continents, and under the
oceans; but he reminds us that most of the rocks that we know are
radioactive. The basalt of the profound depths is therefore radio-
active; it consequently constitutes a practically indefinite source of
heat. One might think that the emanations from this source would
be constant. But Joly in his hypothesis makes the flow variable and
periodic. The release of heat, through the disintegration of the
radioelements, is by paroxysms, separated by long periods of in-
action. Hence the deplacement of the isogeothermal regions in the
interior of the earth; they rise or fall; and the sphere of basalt,
which supports the continents and oceans, is sometimes formed of
solid basalt, sometimes becoming liquefied very near the surface and

THE DRIFTING OF THE CONTINENTS—TERMIER 933

even transformed—another hypothesis—into an extremely mobile
liquid. Let us consider the passage from the solid to the liquid state,
by the rise of the isogeothermes; it is accompanied by great expan-
sions of the basalt and a strong diminution of its density. The bot-
tom of the seas are elevated ; consequently as the mean level of the seas
rise also, the continents would follow this centrifugal movement;
but they are retarded because, being immersed in a liquid the density
of which diminishes, they tend to sink deeper. The result is an
encroachment of the sea on the continent, which the geologists call a
transgression or a positive vertical movement. Some millions of
years pass; the radioactivity becomes quiescent; all the phenomena
are reversed ; the sea recedes; it is a retrogression, a vertical negative
movement. At will we shall thus make marine transgressions and
retrogressions, constant or intermittent, and we shall give them any
extent that we wish; we could as well make them universal. In this
way we shall account for the vertical oscillatory movements.

To explain the tangential movement and the possible drifting of
the continents, Joly invokes the tides. In the periods “of revolu-
tion,” as he calls them, when the basaltic envelope is become molten
and very liquid, very mobile, nearly to the surface, this liquid,
mobile and yet very heavy, undergoes, from the attraction of the
sun and the moon, very strong tidal movements, much stronger, in-
deed, than those of the sea, tides which tend to retard the speed of
rotation about the axis of the superficial terrestrial zones. This re-
tardation, which decreases quickly in depth on account of the in-
creasing viscosity—another hypothesis—is very marked in the parts
of the liquid pyrosphere which are immediately beneath the bot-
tom of the oceans; naturally so much the more marked the nearer
the Equator. Thus originates the tangential force, proceeding
from east to west, in a sense inverse to the rotation, the tangential
force of the molten magma on the submerged parts of the continen-
tal masses. Thus originates the drifting of the continents, and, as
the continents are very fragile—another hypothesis—they break and
fold easily and in this manner the mountain chains are formed. To
those who would object that the theory thus presented explains
neither the transverse chains parallel to the Equator, as the Alps
and the Himalayas, nor the chains near the poles, I imagine that
Joly would respond that the poles in the course of time have changed
places in relation to the great continental masses, and that the
Tethys, on whose site to-day the Himalayas and the Alps run parallel
to the Equator, was perhaps formerly an ocean extending from north
to south, as our Atlantic. The speaker would answer that the chains
which actually extended along the shores of the Pacific were very
nearly of the same age as the Alpine chain and the Himalayas, and
that the difficulty of explaining the simultaneous origin of all the

234 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

chains still existed. I do not know what Joly would reply. I know
only that he would answer and that the discussion would be endless.
“Dieu a livré le monde aux disputes des hommes.” (God has de-
livered the world to the disputes of men.)

For my part, that which keeps me from accepting Wegener’s
theory and from admitting the great mobility, the total mobility of
the continents, is that I believe permanence to be a fact, perma-
nence on the face of an earth incessantly changing, of some pro-
found characteristic features, always recognizable for hundreds of
millions of years, at least since the beginning of the Silurian period.
These features are: First, the existence of a very special Pacific do-
main around which extends a zone equally very special, that I call
the zone Circumpacific; and, in the second place, the existence of a
transverse domain forming a half girdle of the earth, uniting at its
two extremities the transverse domain to the Circumpacific, a do-
main for a long time occupied by the sea—which was the Tethys—
but to-day occupied by two immense chains of mountains of very
different ages, nevertheless very nearly parallel and even, some-
times superimposed over large areas. Yes, as far as I look into the
past I see these two features, permanent or nearly permanent. This
large half girdle, sometimes marine, sometimes folded and moun-
tainous, and what magnificent mountains! extending from the An-
tilles to the islands of the Malay Archipelago, and, completing the
half girdle with a high and large buckle, which puts the finishing
touch to the encircling of the earth, this Circumpacific zone made
of the combination of the juxtaposition of long, uplifted folds
which are the mountains and of the long, depressed folds which
are the submarine valleys, this zone perpetually mobile, where volca-
noes continually become active or quiescent, and which to-day under-
lines this volcanic belt, the belt of fire of the Pacific. I see on the face
of the earth many changes, some deformations, but I am struck less
by the mobility than by the permanence. It seems to me—oh! I
know that I may be mistaken—but it seems to me evident and cer-
tain that the Pacific has always been in the same place and that
only its borders, its depths, and the number and outline of its islands
have varied, and I hold also as almost evident, and almost certain,
that, if the transverse half girdle is very greatly reduced in its
width, perhaps one-half, perhaps two-thirds, by the drawing to-
gether of the continents which it separates, it has not varied much
in its length. It is that indeed, more than this or that improbability
of the explanations of Wegener, or this or that flat denial given by
geological observation to the former pretended welding of the two
continental borders which face each other; it is that which makes
me differ from the German theory, in spite of its undeniable charm
and its real beauty.

THE DRIFTING OF THE CONTINENTS—TERMIER 235

“And yet it does move,” responded Galileo to the philosophers of
his time, who declared it impossible that the earth turned; and still
it turns. I imagine that such is the last response of Wegener to ob-
jections and to criticisms. What matters—is not to know how and
why the continents drift—one will probably never know that—it is
to know whether they have drifted greatly in the past, whether they
are still drifting at the present time, and, consequently, whether we
can predict that they will drift again to-morrow.

Of their great drifting in the past, further than the shifting of
the continental masses which it is necessary to admit in order to
explain the formation of the folded zones, that is to say, the mountain
chains, we are not at all certain. This absolutely necessary displace-
ment is to the extent of many hundreds of kilometers or perhaps a
thousand for a given chain; for all the chains of central Asia ex-
tending over hundreds of millions of years, it might on the whole
amount to 3,000, perhaps 4,000, kilometers. Beyond that one knows
nothing.

It is undoubtedly fascinating to group all the continents of the
Carboniferous epoch, in order to separate them afterwards; it is
undoubtedly enticing to consider the chains of islands as a train of
stragglers behind the advancing continents, but it is not necessary.
These are simply convenient hypotheses. No one is claiming that
to-morrow others more convenient still will not be found. On the
other hand, there is great objection to extensive mobility. The great
objection is permanence; long permanence on the surface of the
earth, of the two features of which I have spoken, the Circumpacific
zone and the transverse zone, parallel to the Equator, and cutting in
two the hemisphere opposite the Pacific domain.

Of the present drifting, supposing it exists, we will soon be ad-
vised by the near resumption of the measures of longitude with a pre-
cision heretofore unknown. You know that radiotelegraph already
permits, or soon will permit, the giving at a certain moment the
hour from a starting point, such as Paris, to all the great observa-
tories of the world. One will deduce from it, within a small number
of meters, the longitude of any point whatever from one of these
observations in a comparison with the zero meridian. After some
years, perhaps, one will thus know whether America is getting farther
away from us, as Wegener thinks; whether it is fixed in relation to
us; or whether the distance between us is diminishing, as I would
be tempted personally to think, for reasons which it would be too
long to here explain and which pertain to the rédle of the geosyn-
cline that I ascribe to the ‘Atlantic. But it is to be feared that
the relative movement, if it exists, may be an extremely slow one, and
that a century may be necessary to surely establish its existence. We
shall then be condemned to die without knowing whether the At-
236 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

lantic is advancing or receding, and on that account many of us
will find difficulty in consoling ourselves.

Twice before I have had the very great honor of speaking here.
The first time in 1912, when I spoke of Atlantis. I discussed the
disappearance of Atlantis, its sinking into the abyss, at a very recent
period, so recent, as Plato tells us, that perhaps man was present at
the cataclysm and suffered from it. The second time was in 1920;
I spoke then of the history of the oceans through the ages, the suc-
cessive formation of the Indian Ocean and the Atlantic by shrinkage
and, by contrast, the long persistence of the Pacific domain to the
state of special domain, perpetually agitated.

The theory of Wegener has not greatly changed my ideas on
oceanic history, and I indeed believe I should speak to-day of Atlan-
tis, of the Indian Ocean, and of the Pacific as I spoke of them in
1912 and 1920. The theory of Wegener is to me a beautiful dream,
the dream of a great poet. One tries to embrace it, and finds that
he has in his arms but a little vapor or smoke; it is at the same time
both alluring and intangible.

But in all reality we can not conclude, we can not say, that there
is really nothing in Wegener’s theory; neither can we affirm that it
does not contain some truth. Our knowledge is very limited. It is
always necessary to close a lecture on geology in humility. On the
ship earth which bears us into immensity toward an end which God
alone knows, we are steerage passengers. We are emigrants who
know only their own misfortune. The least ignorant among us, the
most daring, the most restless, ask ourselves questions; we demand
when the voyage of humanity began, how long it will last, how the
ship goes, why do its decks and hull vibrate, why do sounds some-
times come up from the hold and go out by the hatchway; we ask
what secrets do the depths of the strange vessel conceal and we
suffer from never knowing the secrets. Most of us content ourselves
with living, awaiting each day the morrow, which we hope will be
better.

You and I are of the group of restless and daring ones who would
like to know and who are never satisfied with any response. We
hold ourselves together on the prow of the ship, attentive to all the
indications which come from the mysterious interior, or the monot-
onous sea, or the still more monotonous sky. We console each other
by speaking of the shore toward which we devoutly believe we sail,
where we shall indeed arrive, where we shall go ashore to-morrow,
perhaps. This shore not one of us has ever seen, but all would recog-
nize it without hesitation were it to appear on the horizon. For
it is the shore of the country of our dreams, where the air is so pure
there is no death, the country of al] our desires, and its name is

THE PROBABLE SOLUTION OF THE CLIMATE PROBLEM
IN GEOLOGY?

By WILHELM RAMSAY

Professor of Geology and Mineralogy at the University of Helsingfors, Finland

I

In the following pages I have endeavored to give an interpretation,
not only of the appearance of ice ages, but also of the greater changes
of climate registered in the geological record. In view of the im-
portance ascribed in this discussion to hypsometric conditions and
land forms, I have named the theory the relief hypothesis.’

Kindred explanations have been put forward before. Lyell would
find the causes of the great alternations of climate during past ages
in the continuous changes of the distribution of land and sea which
lad been going on all through the geologic ages. J. G. Charpentier,
in the first half of the nineteenth century, supposed that the glacia-
tion of the Alps and other tracts had been greater formerly because
these were much more elevated. Since then various hypotheses of
continental elevation have been set forth as solution of the climate
problem in geology. It is easy to discover the weak points in these
suggestions and to understand why they have not been found appli-
cable. But there is one strong point in all of them. They have looked
for the causes of the geologic changes of climate in geographic
changes which the earth may have undergone. The relief hypothesis
follows the same lines.

This theory does not explain why ancient glacial formations,
such as the Permian, are now found far from the poles, often near
the Equator. In order to understand this and other very anomalous
situations of climatic zones of the past, one can hardly avoid postu-
lating migrations of the poles or the continents.

The question to be answered here is:

Why have some geological periods been characterized by glaciation
and various other signs of cooler climate, while the earth in other
periods was favored with very warm climates which extended their
influence apparently to all parts of the globe?

The very question arises from our knowledge that geological
evolution has not been uniform. On the contrary, as is commonly
understood and admitted, orogeny, volcanism, degradation, and
aggradation, and all other constructive and destructive processes
show great differences in their intensity from period to period, and
these variations are cyclic and rhythmic. The measure of the
rhythm is indicated by the formation of the mountain chains.

Since the beginning of the Cambrian period, the evolution of the
earth has passed through three geologic cycles of higher order and
commenced a fourth. The transition from one to another is marked
by the unconformities which in the stratigraphical series follow the
Caledonian, Hercynian, and Alpine diastrophism. The great cycles
are:

Cycle— | Part 1 Part 2 Main orogeny
Je seasons | Eocambrian-Cambrian-Ordovician_ ----_-.---------- Gothlandian --____-_-- Caledonian.

) ON ee Permian: Drisssic-JWrassies2 =) 22 oe ee eee Cretaceous-Tertiary__-| Alpine.
DV totes Se Quaternary. 44. 2* fet RR ee a ee oe

The first part of each cycle comprises an anorogenic phase of
long duration. The cycles enter then in a first orogenic phase, a
forerunner of the main mountain-making movements. After this,
relatively anorogenic periods follow in the second part of each cycle.
From this point, however, disturbances become more frequent, and
’ at the end of the cycle, the main mountain folding takes place, to
continue here and there, with decreasing strength, in the beginning
of the following cycle.

The above tabulation in cycles of the geological periods is in
no manner meant to assert that these were of equal duration, nor
that the corresponding phases from different cycles represent quite
similar stages in geological evolution. It is of course possible to
dispose the periods in cycles in many other ways. But however we
arrange them, we shall find that the rhythm of orogeny has regulated
the general course of the history of the earth.

Thus volcanic activity has always been not only geographically
combined with the zones of folding and faulting, but also chrono-
logically connected with the formation of mountain chains, being
strongest during, and immediately after, orogenic times, feeblest
in anorogenic periods.

The great transgressions and regressions of the sea follow the

same rhythm. In the periods of orogeny and immediately after,

there is considerable general regression. The land areas were ex-
tensive then, as they are at present. The greatest transgressions.
again, appeared in the anorogenic intervals.

SOLUTION OF THE CLIMATE PROBLEM—RAMSAY 239

The relief of the continents has also changed in accord with the
orogenic rhythm, a fact of special interest for the theory put forward
in this paper.

The mountain folding, and all events in connection with it,
brought the various parts of the earth’s crust into positions which
no longer corresponded to the previously existing isostasy. In con-
sequence of this, there was again a tendency to new isostasy, re-
sulting in elevations here and depressions there. These displace-
ments were greatest after the diastrophism at the end of each cycle,
while features hitherto prevailing in the aspect of the continental
blocks were replaced by new ones.

The great disturbances enormously changed the relief of the
foregoing period. Thus, at the beginning of a new cycle, not only
were the land areas greater than at other times, they were also
more elevated, and it was then that the loftiest mountains rose on
the continents. Then, too, the sea had its greatest depth. For
only so could it, in spite of its reduced area, contain the same
masses of water.

The Quaternary period and the Recent time belong to such an
era of high continents and deep oceans. The mountains, only
formed in the later part of the Tertiary period, are still lofty, and
in all continents there are old peneplains in which a young erosion
has carved new valleys. This phenomenon is so common that all
examples of typical peneplains referred to in literature are pre-
Quaternary ones. This signifies, first, that before the crustal
movements by which the different portions of the continents came
in their present level, the land masses had been in a state of relative
repose for so long a time that they were completely degraded, and
secondly, that the altitude of most parts of the continents is at
present greater than in the pre-Quaternary time. Indeed, we find
undisturbed Tertiary marine deposits at high levels, and the most
elevated of them belong to the oldest Tertiary beds, while younger
occur at lower levels. Even Pliocene deposits lie at many places
high above the beaches of both recent and Quaternary seas.

It is not astonishing that the elevation of the continents, with
their highlands and mountains, reached its greatest altitude in
Quaternary time. We may call to mind that tangential movements
were still going on during this period in many mountains, and
many remarkable faultings are equally young. Further, the now
existing valleys were formed in Pliocene and at the beginning of
Pleistocene time, as is well known and often emphasized. It is
very probable, as Nansen* suggests, that in consequence of this
erosion the mountain-ridges may have been raised by isostatical

upheaval to levels higher above the sea than those at which the
summits of the mountains stood before the erosion began.

There is thus good evidence that the relief of the continents
gradually grew higher and more uneven in the course of the Pliocene
and Pleistocene ages, and that the elevation of the mountains over
the valleys, of the highlands over the lowlands, and of the con-
tinents over the sea, reached its maximum in the beginning of the
Quaternary period, whereafter it has rather diminished. By analogy,
we have the right to assume that the continents also had their
highest and most mountainous reliefs at the beginning of the elder,
i. e. of the Caledonion, Hercynian, and Alpinian cycles. Like-
wise, the relief must, in higher or lower degree, have been elevated
and mountainous at the orogenic phases within the cycles, though
not so high as after the three chief ages of diastrophism.

During the long anorogenic phases of the cycles, the mountains
and hills were broken down and the continents finally peneplained.

The changes of relief show themselves also in the nature of the
sediments. Conglomerates, sandstones, grits, and other coarse
clastic rocks prevail in the systems deposited during and after the
orogenic phases. They testify to the activity of running water
with strong power of erosion and transport; that is, that the ground
was high and sloped considerably. In the systems from the end of
the anorogenic phases, again, muddy deposits and limestones are
predominant. The rivers did not bring coarse material down to the
sea, in many cases not even finest mud, since the land was low and
plain.

The above suggestions concerning relief in the past and present
may be briefly summed up.

Geological events have not proceeded uniformly, but cyclically.
There were not at all ages lofty mountains and highlands in some
regions, with plain lowlands, or even lower mountain districts, in
others, as it is the case nowadays. For the formation and destruc-
tion of mountains has not during all time outbalanced each other.
In some periods the former, in others the latter, process was
prevailing. Only after the orogenic phases was the relief comparable
to that of the present day, or still higher and more broken. For
such a condition I will use the term orocratic. During anorogenic
periods, again, the continents became more or less peneplained. I
call such a condition pediocratic. Of course, there are gradual
transitions between these two kinds of relief.

The changes of climate can also be fitted into the frame of the
geological cycles.

In some ages in the history of the earth ice caps have covered
vast areas, just as in recent times. I have named such periods

miothermic or less warm.t This term may also be used to designate
the less-warm climate and the corresponding deposits. In most
geological systems, however, we do not find any traces of glacial
formations, or other phenomena evidencing a cold climate. There
is rather every indication of favorable conditions for animals and
plants over all the earth. For the corresponding periods and con-
ditions, I have proposed the name pliothermic or more warm. We
are now living in a miothermic period. It includes not only the
Quaternary ice age, but also the interglacial and postglacial ages.
For during them all, ice caps and glaciers existed. An ice age
signifies aggravated miothermic conditions.

Which periods were miothermic, which pliothermic?

Traces of glaciation in the shape of tillite are found in pre-
Cambrian formations. We know them, further, from the base of
the Paleozoic series, and in the Eodevonian, Permian, perhaps in
the oldest Cretaceous, and finally the Quaternary. They are formed
in periods immediately after the great orogenic events, when the
relief was orocratic. All other periods are pliothermic, and the
obvious warmest coincide with the phases of least disturbance of the
earth’s crust and the greatest general transgressions, when the con-
tinents had the most pediocratic relief. Between orogeny and
climate, there is an evident connection which I pointed out some
years ago (1910). (“Orogenesis und Klima” cited above.)

Dacqué, who has elaborated this theme in still greater detail, has
in his instructive treatise on paleogeography § illustrated graphically
the changes of climate from the Cambrian time to the present day
and the intensity of the orogenesy during the same space of time.
Those interested will see in the diagrams in the work cited (pp.
432 and 449) a striking parallelism between these two curves.

How may the apparent relation between the formation of moun-
tains and the deterioration of climate be interpreted ?

It is hardly possible to explain it by astronomical theories con-
cerning the ice ages, unless. one supposes that the plication of moun-
tain chains depends upon those astronomic constellations which have
been thought to cause decline of heat on the earth’s surface.

The hypotheses which find the cause of the ice ages in a protracted
decrease of radiation from the sun, help us no more, for it is not
probable that orogeny on the earth is produced by such a change
in the sun.

It thus remains to look for the answer to the above question in cir- .
cumstances connected with orogeny which have the effect that the

242 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

earth is less heated by the radiation from the sun than if mountain-
making had not happened.

The carbonic acid hypothesis (Arrhenius) will here come under
consideration. But an examination will show that no such diminu-
tion in the supply of carbonic acid as the theory requires to explain
the severer climate—i. e., lessening of volcanic activity—happened
in the miothermic ages. On the contrary, volcanism was most power-
ful during the orogenic phases and immediately after them, while
again, it was least active during the anorogenic and pliothermic
periods. Thus, even for these reasons alone the carbonic acid
theory is not applicable.

The simplest and most probable interpretation of the connection
between orogeny and climate lies herein, that the orocratic relief
which the continents had after an orogenic phase, influenced the
climate in such a manner as to establish miothermic conditions.
When, again, the continents were pediocratic, as in anorogenic times,
the climate became pliothermic.

It is well known that a climate is modified by the relief and the
elevation of a region, and that with increasing altitude it gradually
becomes cooler and even glacial. Further, mountains and high-
lands exercise a great effect as condensers of precipitation, as bound-
aries of climate, etc. But meteorologists and geologists reflect less
often that the relief of the continents influences not only the local
or regional climate, but the whole economy of the calories which the
sun supplies. In the paper cited, “ Orogenesis und Klima,” I have
endeavored to show that the influence of relief on the climate can
be remarked in the following circumstances.

1. The more the radiation from the earth can be retarded, the
more the temperature rises. In this storing of heat the atmosphere
plays the chief part by its selective absorption, the effect of which
has been compared with that of the glass on the hotbed. It yields
the most favorable result on extensive lowlands, and if all continents
were pediocratic, as supposed for pliothermic periods, they would
profit by the sun’s heat at the highest temperature. But this so-to-
say ideal thermical state is disturbed by an orocratic relief. The
air mantle upon the mountains and highlands is thinner and less
dense than the atmosphere over the lowlands. In consequence,
insolation certainly is greater, but the loss of heat by radiation into
space has increased in a much higher degree. Moreover, as in all
mountain regions the rising of warm and sinking of cold air are en-
hanced by the greater insolation and radiation, the loss will thus
be accelerated. In the above comparison with the glass on the hot-
bed, the lofty parts of the continents can be regarded as holes in
the glass. They not only chill the place just beneath them, but more
or less the whole hotbed.

SOLUTION OF THE CLIMATE PROBLEM—RAMSAY 243

2. The orocratic relief augments the loss of heat still further by
its influence on the circulation of air along the surface of the earth.
The air currents, passing over mountains, high coasts, and other
elevations in their way, are compelled to rise, and at the higher posi-
tion their loss of heat by radiation is greater than if they had flowed
at a lower level. When descending on the other side of the heights
they hold less heat than when they rose, even if one takes into con-
sideration the dynamic heating of falling winds.

3. On their way up-hill, the air currents get their temperature
lowered and a great part of their vapor condensed. In consequence,
rain and snow fall more frequently and abundantly when the relief
is orocratic than they must do in periods when the relief is pedio-
cratic. With the increased precipitation the temperature also is
lowered. For the calories which the condensation sets free are but
a compensation for the dynamic cooling of the air, and for the loss
by radiation into space, and the fallen rain and snow, having
normally a lower temperature than the air near the ground, demand
great quantities of calories for their heating and evaporation.

If, again, the relief is pediocratic, the circulation of the winds
would be more regular, and the precipitation diminished, at least at
higher latitudes, and accordingly the loss of heat less. Besides, the
air holds more vapor and has a greater capacity to retard the radin-
tion into space.

4. The principal importance of the orocratic relief in producing
a miothermic state is, however, that the lofty parts of the land
reach up into colder layers of the atmosphere, where they will be
covered with perennial snow and ice. The more numerous, the
higher and vaster the elevated tracts are, the more extensive the
glaciated areas of the continents. And all the circumstances
enumerated above which follow with orocratic relief, cooperate to
lower the snow line and thus to widen these areas.

The ice caps, when once formed, and the annual snow fields of
longer or shorter duration, have furthered the evolution of the mio-
thermic climate. Insolation, reflection, and radiation take place on
snow fields in such a way that the heat from the sun is only used
to a slight degree for raising the temperature. Great masses of
snow remain unmelted. The melting of the rest consumes a large
part of the heat of the warm season, not only the direct isolation,
but in addition a considerable supply from the environs. Thus, the
snow fields and ice caps cause a lowering of the temperature outside
their boundaries, and the cold water from them runs far beyond the
ends of the glaciers and deprives the neighborhood of heat.

5. More than other glacial regions, lands at high latitudes are
responsible for the establishment of pronounced miothermic con-
ditions. If there only exist high enough islands and continents,
244 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

ice caps will appear, extend their glaciers down to the sea, and send
out their armadas of icebergs. To melt them enormous quantities
of the heat reserve of the sea will be consumed. Cold water forms
extensive superficial layers, and gradually fills the depth of the
ocean right to the Equator.

6. The greater the ice caps grow, the more ice is bound in them
which otherwise would run as water back to the sea. Consequently,
its surface falls. Tylor*® drew attention to this as early as the year
1868, and since then it has been discussed by many scientists. Nan-
sen? has lately treated the question in detail. According to him,
the surface of the sea would rise 1 meter, if the now existing
glaciated areas were melted to an average depth of 24 m., and at the
maximum of the Quaternary glaciation (altogether 50 million km,
average thickness 1,000 m.), the land ice contained so much water
that the sea may have been at least 130 m. shallower than it is to-day.
Nansen has made in his calculations very moderate assumptions of
the extension and thickness of the ice caps. Double the supposed
thickness and more does not seem to be improbable. As we see, there
must have been considerable changes of the sea level by this cause,
and it is obvious, that with such a sinking of the sea, the snow line
and the glaciers also must have moved downward.

Thus, miothermic conditions and ice ages are established as a con-
sequence of orocratic relief.

If we now imagine the relief pediocratic, we shall find not only
that the conditions producing glaciation and miothermic climate no
longer exist, but also that the climate must have been pliothermic,
much warmer than at present.

Even in the Arctic regions, the snow line lies at considerable
heights above the sea level. This was the original condition also
on the Antarctic continent, where the now existing snow line at the
sea level has resulted from the active cooling effect of the huge gla-
ciated land and the passivity of the cooled sea. This proves that,
when the continents are peneplained, as assumed, they in no place
reach up to so high a level that perennial snow could be formed and
ice caps cover them. The disadvantageous effect which glaciation
has on the climate, fails. Heat is not taken from the atmosphere to
melt ice, nor from the hydrosphere, for there are no longer any ice-
bergs in the sea. Cold water does not extend over the surface of the
sea at high latitudes, and the cold water in the depths receives no
addition, but the oceans are gradually heated to ever greater depth,
and the surface layer of warm water grows thicker and warmer.
The sea currents and winds bring more heat from the low latitudes to

Glacial Period ’’: Geol. Mag., Vol. V, 1868, p. 576.

SOLUTION OF THE CLIMATE PROBLEM—RAMSAY 245

the polar regions, where the heated sea remains unfrozen and the
climate becomes genial. If we further consider the regular circula-
tion of the winds, disturbed by no mountains or elevations, and the
augmented selective absorption of the atmosphere, we shall under-
stand the conditions which led to the pliothermic climates, of which
the fossils and sediments give evidence.

We need not look for any other cause of the great changes of
climate during past periods or of the ice ages, than the changes of
relief which the continents have undergone.

II

It is also generally admitted that a mountainous relief is an essen-
tial condition of glaciation. But against the assumption that oro-
cratic relief is the cause of ice ages, it has been argued that the relief
has not shifted during the Quaternary period in a manner corre-
sponding to the great differences in the climate of the ice age and
recent times and of the repeated glacial ages and interglacial ages.
And consequently, as change of relief can not be the cause of the
Quaternary alternations of climate, the actual cause of them, when
once found, may also prove to include a better explanation of the
greater climatic changes than the relief hypothesis. ‘This objection
does not destroy the theory.

For, if a miothermic climate is established—owing to an orocratic
relief, as I think, or to other causes—it will for a long time oscillate
between severer and milder conditions before a certain equilibrium
is reached. Paschinger ® has recently tried to show that the influence
exercised by glaciation itself upon the level of “ the zone of maximal
precipitation ” and on its own growth and decay, brings with it cyclic
variations great enough to lead to glacial and interglacial stages.
Certainly those meteorologic factors help to enhance and diminish
glaciation, but it seems that the repeated accumulation and dissolu-
tion of the ice caps is due to alternating elevations and depressions
of the glaciated regions.

This was suggested by Upham,’ referring to Jamieson’s ?° assump-
tions that the regions had sunk under the load of the ice caps and
been raised by the removal of this load. Meanwhile, he combined
with his theory features from the astronomic explanations of the

ice ages, and, further, thought that subsidence of one region caused
uplift of other portions of the earth’s crust; so that glacial condi-
tions may have prevailed alternately in the Northern and South-
ern Hemispheres or in North America and Europe. But there
are weighty reasons enough for assuming a simultaneous appearance,
not only of the glaciations on the Northern and Southern Hemis-
pheres, but also of the successive Quaternary ice ages in different
quarters of the world.

The supposition that the dissolution of the ice caps resulted from
the depression of the regions under the load of the ice, has, however,
been considered fallacious.11 The depression being, namely, at
isostatic equilibrium only about one-third of the thickness of the
ice, the surface of an ice-covered region is always more elevated than
the region was before its glaciation. Consequently, the ice cap does
not disappear. Such a reasoning is right, if one has in view only
the isostatic depression. But here come the changes of sea level.
too, as we shall see. |

At the beginning of the Quaternary period the continents had
orocratic relief, as at the beginning of the earlier miothermic ages.
Their higher parts became glaciated, the ice caps grew bigger, as
described above, the sea was chilled, and the climate deteriorated.
Enormous quantities of water being confined in the land ice, the sea
level, and with it the snowline, sank. The ice fields grew still larger,
until they extended to so low levels or latitudes that the heat of the
summer stopped them at a certain maximum. However, an equilib-
rium between glaciation and melting did not yet come about. For
as the ice caps got bigger and thicker, they loaded more and more
the areas occupied by them. The crust of the earth gave way and
began to sink, but not in the same proportion as the ice load in-
creased. The depression certainly reached its greatest depth only
after, and long after, the maximum of glaciation, just as in the
contrary case, the upheaval of Fenno-Scandia and other formerly
glaciated regions has continued long after their release from the
weight of the ice, and still continues.

As the depression proceeded, the ice-covered regions came gradu-
ally into lower positions in relation to the levels of the snow and
glacier lines for maximum glaciation. The ablation now gained
upon the advance of the glaciers; the ice masses began to diminish.
The addition of water to the sea raised its level, and thus also the
snow line. This accelerated the melting of the ice, the sea level rose
steadily, and soon. The more the sea level rose, the better the warm
sea currents could pass over submarine thresholds and penetrate
to higher latitudes. All this worked together to lessen glaciation
and hastened the amelioration of the climate.

SOLUTION OF THE CLIMATE PROBLEM—RAMSAY 947

Meanwhile, as the weight of the ice caps diminished to correspond
to the depression of the ice-loaded area (1. e., as the average thick-
ness of the ice was about three times the amount of the depression),
the crustal sinking had reached its maximum and reversed in up-
heaval. But the dissolution of the ice, once begun, continued be-
cause the steady addition of water to the sea raised the snow line.
In the race between the upheaval and the rising of the sea level, the
latter won. When delivered from ice, the just glaciated regions
were still deeply submerged.** Further, the snow line may have
risen more than the sea level in consequence of the amelioration of
the climate by the decrease of the glaciation. The melting, the
rising of the snow line, and the general improvement of the climate
proceeded rather in an accelerated degree, on analogy with the case
in late-glacial time in Fenno-Scandia investigated by De Geer ” and
Sauramo.’* Finally an interglacial stage with restricted glaciation
and genial climate appeared.

But the loftier portions of the regions were gradually raised anew
above the snow line and glaciated. All the consequences of this
pointed out in the foregoing pages led to a new general ice age, again
followed by an interglacial stage, and so on.

Above, the isostatic rise of the sea floor by the abstraction of water
from the ocean and the subsidence of ice-covered land is omitted, as
also the reverse events. If considered, they should accent the sup-
posed effect of crustal movements on growth and decline of the ice
caps.

The cause of these oscillations (fig. 1) between severer and milder
miothermic climate is, then, that the land movements due to the
increasing and decreasing of the ice caps have their maxima and
minima at other points of time than the variations of the ice caps
and of the sea level (snow line). In the course of time the ampli-
tudes of the successive oscillations must decrease until a balance in
the miothermic climate is attained: moderate glaciation with iso-
static equilibrium between depression and ice load, cessation of
upheaval or submergence of the formerly glaciated lands. We are
not yet at that point. I think, with Nansen,“ that the last post-
glacial transgression of the sea in Fenno-Scandia indicates the
maximum of dissolution of the ice caps and the highest position of

the sea level. The climate then was most favorable and has since
declined.

In the diagrammatic presentation of the alternation of glacial and
interglacial stages, it is not to be supposed that this proceeds in just
the same way in different regions. Their varying size and altitude
make it possible that their maxima and minima of glaciation or
upheaval and sinking will not absolutely coincide, and the glaciation
of different regions not be of equal duration. Further, their geo-
graphical situation can in many ways alter the influence of cold or
hot sea currents, winds, and other agencies. Notwithstanding, the
changes of climate must on the whole correspond in the different
regions all over the globe, regulated as they are by the general chill-
ing and heating of the oceans and by the general sinking and rising
of the sea level.

The theory here proposed contains a general thesis: That the al-
ternating pliothermic and miothermic conditions depend upon
changes between pediocratic and orocratic relief, and a special thesis
that the succession of glacial and interglacial ages during a miother-
mic period depends upon isostatic and eustatic oscillations of level.
The theory thus sees the causes of the different climates during past
eras in different geographical circumstances. Attempts to solve the
puzzling question from this point of view were made almost a hun-
dred years ago and have never been abandoned. One by one the
facts and ideas on which the above theory is founded have been put
forward and with the increase of our geological knowledge they have
grown ever clearer and more convincing. I believe, therefore, that
the relief theory will be approved as the true solution of the clima-
tologic problem in geology, though it may be only after discussion
and improvement.
A MODERN MENAGERIE; MORE ABOUT THE NATIONAL
ZOOLOGICAL PARK

By N. HOLuIstTer

[With 18 plates]

The zoological garden idea is a very old one, and its inception
dates back beyond all written history. It is certain that primitive
man early began to surround himself with captive beasts, some of
which became the progenitors of our modern domestic animals.
Collections of wild animals formed a conspicuous part in civil and
religious life throughout many of the early civilizations, and the
menagerie, both public and private, developed into an institution of
most remarkable proportions and importance. The ancient Egyp-
tians kept great collections of living animals, including not only
the native species but others brought from distant parts of the
then known world. In the United States National Museum is a
large case of thousands of bones, dating from about 2000 B. C.,
which were collected by Doctor Hrdlicka from tombs in Egypt.
This great lot of bones contains the remains of many species of wild
animals, and the number of big bears is remarkable. The ancient
rulers of Mongolia and of China maintained deer parks and menag-
eries; and the great interest of the Greeks and the Romans in
collections of living animals is well known.

In the New World, numbers of native animals were early domesti-
cated, and the Aztec kings kept well arranged collections of wild
beasts and birds for the instruction of their peoples. The first
American buffalo seen by European eyes was confined in the me-
nagerie of the last Aztec emperor of Mexico, Montezuma; this was
nine or ten years before the buffalo was discovered in a wild state
to the northward, and the captive animal had been brought not less
than four or five hundred miles to the Aztec zoo.

There is always something fascinating about the capture, taming,
and care of wild animal pets; and almost any one who has, as a child,
experienced these joys, appreciates, later in life, the modern zoo-
logical garden. That the zoological garden is one of the most popular
of municipal enterprises is evidenced by the great activity in its de-

249
250 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

velopment in recent years throughout the civilized world. In Amer-
ica, particularly, the number of zoos has increased enormously of late,
and requests for information on development, cost, and care are
coming in to the Smithsonian Institution from cities, large and
small, at a constantly increasing rate.

The attendance at the National Zoological Park now regularly
exceeds two million visitors annually, and in 1924 reached the record
figure of 2,442,880. The park was established by an act of Congress
approved April 30, 1890, “ for the advancement of science and the
instruction and recreation of the people,” and has been, from the first,
under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution. When the present
site was occupied in 1891, a small collection of animals then kept
near the Smithsonian Building and known 4s the Division of Living
Animals, United States National Museum, was moved to the new
location. The National Zoological Park, like the National Gallery
of Art, is thus a direct offshoot of the National Museum. At that
time the only important zoological gardens in America were in
Philadelphia and Cincinnati; although some few other cities main-
tained small city-park menageries like the one still in Central Park.
New York.

The National Zoological Park was, at the time of its establish-
ment, some distance from the main part of the city of Washington,
but the rapid growth of the city to the northwest has entirely sur-
rounded it, and now it is in the center of one of the best residential
districts. Fortunately, its area of 175 acres, much of which is wood-
ed land, gives sufficient space and seclusion, and the city develop-
ment has added to, rather than detracted from, the value of the site
for zoological garden purposes. Rock Creek Park, later established,
joins the National Zoological Park on the north.

Visitors to the Zoological Park daily remark on the splendid col-
lection of animals, the cleanly quarters, and the care and effort that
must be taken to provide such an interesting and varied collection
of the mammals, birds, and reptiles of the world. Few realize,
however, the magnitude of the task involved, the varied require-
ments of bird and beast, or the expert services necessary for their
health, comfort and care.

The modern zoological garden is a very different affair from the
old-time menagerie. New plans for the comfort and health of the
animals, new methods for more satisfactory exhibition, new ar-
rangements for the constantly increasing numbers of visitors, are
all the time being considered, and each improvement is eagerly
adopted as soon as its merits are proved and funds are available for
its realization.

Animals are expensive, and many of the rarer species are not
easily obtained at any price. The opportunities to secure any but
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—-HOLLISTER 951

the most common and constantly imported species are of irregular
occurrence, and few may be had at the moment no matter how much
money may be available for their purchase. The first considera-
tion, then, is the health of the animal; contentment and health
being necessary to long survival, and if the unusual species are
to be shown regularly and for long periods the most expert care is
often necessary to maintain in proper condition the specimens that
may be secured.

Few persons realize how much ingenuity and resourcefulness are
regularly expended to make wild animals the healthy and contented
pets they usually become in captivity. The individual animal, as
well as the species, must be studied. Some do best in large inclosures ;
some best in smaller cages. It is frequently found that certain
parrots and other birds, perhaps reared from nestlings by some
native woman, are extremely unhappy in large cages, refuse food,
and would soon die unless promptly returned to a small cage. Then
they are obviously very happy again and most often live for many
years in perfect health and contentment. An exceptionally fine
puma in the National Zoological Park, most contented and thrifty in
a small old-fashioned cage—one of the first cages ever built in the
park and scarcely larger than a circus wagon cage—simply “ went
to pieces” and refused to eat anything whatever when transferred
to a fine, large, airy, outdoor inclosure. He was promptly returned
to his dingy old cage, greatly to his delight and benefit; in a short
time he was fat and sleek again.

It was once advocated by a famous animal lover that wild animals
in captivity should be changed frequently to strange cages, where
they could enjoy new surroundings and a‘different view. All ex-
perienced animal keepers know the fallacy of this argument. Ani-
mals grow to feel safe and contented in familiar, even though
restricted, quarters; but are frequently greatly distressed and upset
in strange surroundings or when any unusual activities are going on
about them. If animals were frequently changed the loss would be
great. Contented animals in small quarters very often live far
beyond the age usual to wild animals of the same kind. Few persons
realize the home-loving character of wild animals, and how limited
the normal ranges of individuals are, unless the creatures are driven
from place to place by predatory beasts and man. Every wild animal
is continually searching for a “ safety zone,” and this is exactly what
quarters in a well-conducted zoological park supply.

THE NATIONAL COLLECTIONS

; There are now nearly 1,700 animals in the collection of the Na-
tional Zoological Park, including mammals, birds, and reptiles. The
252 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

collection of mammals is one of the finest in the world, and is par-
ticularly notable for the large number of rare species seldom seen
in collections of living animals. There are now 18 different species
of bears on exhibition, represented by 23 individuals, including a
fine specimen of the glacier bear (Ursus emmonsii), the first of its
kind ever to reach a zoological park. Other carnivores in this notable
collection include 12 species of wild dogs, the most unusual of
which is the South American bush dog (Jctieyon venaticus); an
aard-wolf (Proteles cristatus), a rare member of the hyena family
from South Africa; and 14 species of the cat family, among them,
in addition to the regular exhibition of lions, tigers, leopards, etc.,
examples of the cheetah, or hunting leopard (Acinonyx jubatus),
snow leopard (Felis uncia), and clouded leopard (Weofelis ne-
bulosa).

The collection of monkeys now contains about 30 species, among
which may be mentioned such rarities as the gelada baboon
(Theropithecus obscurus), 4 species of mangabeys, and the Moor
macaque (Cynopithecus maurus). There are 55 species of hoofed
animals, many of them represented by fine breeding herds. The
reindeer, Alpine ibex, Rocky Mountain goat, Rocky Mountain sheep,
musk ox, black rhinoceros, Baird’s tapir, African and Sumatran
elephants are among the unusual species shown.

Among the birds, the waterfowl, cranes, birds of prey, and os-
triches and their allies are especially well represented, and the col-
lection contains many rare varieties. The kiwi (Apteryx2 mantellz),
Hawaiian goose (Nesochen sandvicensis), California condor (Gym-
nogyps californianus), and kagu (Rhynochetos jubatus) may be
mentioned as of especial interest in this connection. There are now
on exhibition 190 parrots of 50 different species.

The prize exhibits in the reptile department are extra fine spec-
imens of the anaconda, some large pythons, one of them 25 feet
long, and 4 specimens of the virtually extinct giant tortoise of the
Galapagos Islands.

A unique exhibition is the North American Waterfowl Lake,
wherein are shown only such species of ducks, geese, and swans as
are known to occur in North America. This restriction to native
species is very much appreciated by bird students and sportsmen,
who are confused if exotic species are mixed with native forms. At
present this inclosure contains about 200 waterfowl of 35 different
species. The lake has been constructed and planted to represent
one of the woodland ponds common to parts of the eastern United
States, and its natural appearance makes it differ greatly from the
highly artificial lakes usual to zoological gardens. Fresh water
from Rock Creek is constantly flowing through it, and a dam in
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—-HOLLISTER 958

the creek below the inlet to the lake assures an even level of fresh
water.

The National Zoological Park has always been particularly suc-
cessful in the breeding and rearing of animals. In addition to large
numbers of deer, antelopes, bisons, camels, llamas, guanacos, yaks,
and other ruminants, many lions, tigers, pumas, and other great cats,
bears, wolves, kangaroos, etc., have been reared. Tapirs and hippo-
potamuses have been regularly reared also, and in recent years
great success has been obtained in breeding such unusual species as
Rocky Mountain sheep, mountain goats, and reindeer.

Young animals are always of intense interest to visitors, and it is
a great satisfaction to the keepers to be able to show them. Nothing,
perhaps, speaks so highly for the condition of a collection of living
animals as regular success in rearing the young. Baby lions, tigers,
bears, and monkeys always attract and hold the attention of great
crowds of enthusiastic visitors.

One of the most remarkable instances of memory by a lower
animal for a human friend that ever came within my personal
observation had to do with a baby hippopotamus born in the park.
The little fellow had been a great favorite with his keepers, who
always called him “Buster”; and when, at nearly 2 years of age,
he was exchanged to the St. Louis Zoological Society, Mr. W. H.
Blackburne, the head keeper, accompanied him in a special express
car on the journey. For a large part of the trip the car was attached
next behind the locomotive tender, and the young hippo was nat-
urally distressed and nervous. He was perfectly contented and
quiet, though, if Mr. Blackburne sat at the head of the crate and
allowed him to suck his fingers, and as a consequence Mr. Black-
burne spent the better part of one whole night in this position with
his hand in the mouth of the baby hippo. ‘

On his arrival at the St. Louis Zoological Gardens the hippo was
rechristened “Steve,” became a general pet, and was known to
everyone by his new name. Nearly two years later Mr. Black-
burne and I were visiting the St. Louis zoo and came into the hippo
house, with a number of other people, just at feeding time. The
young hippo, now very much grown, was eager for his food, which
was then being placed for him at one end of his large indoor in-
closure. Mr. Blackburne hailed the animal with his old-time “ Hello,
Buster!” just as he had done hundreds of times in Washington two
years and more before. The response from the hippo was instant;
he turned at the sound of the old name, and after Mr. Blackburne
went back of the guard rail and the hippo had smelled of his hands
and received the old-time pats on his great lips, absolutely identify-
ing his old friend, he refused, for the time, to pay any attention to

20397—25——18
254 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

his food or his keeper. There was absolutely no mistaking his
actions; he was at first startled, then puzzled, and then, as his mem-
ory awakened, highly pleased. His recognition was positive. It
was a most interesting and instructive lesson in animal psychology,
but had I not actually witnessed the performance I am sure I should
have been somewhat skeptical of a tale of such intelligence and
memory on the part of a hippopotamus. Many interesting tales
of the affection of animals for their keepers could be told by those
familiar with the zoo.

Zoological garden men are always interested in longevity records
and take pride in the number of years that certain animals have
been kept in their collections. The death rate at the National
Zoological Park has always been kept very low, and the records
show some splendid accomplishments in keeping wild animals in
perfect health for periods long above the average for their kind.

At the present time there is living in the garden only a single
animal that formed part of the original collection moved from the
Smithsonian Institution when the park was first occupied in 1891.
This is a sulphur-crested cockatoo (Kakatoe galerita) which was
presented to the Institution on April 19, 1890, and has thus been
in the collection for 35 years. The bird was fully adult when re-
ceived, and the few employees who remember it as it first came
say that it is unchanged in appearance or vitality. Only seven
other old residents of the park date back to the nineties, as follows:
An American white pelican received from Yellowstone National
Park in 1897; a bald eagle received from Gen. Nelson A Miles in
1898; an Alaskan bald eagle received from Gen. R. A. Alger, Sec-
retary of War, in 1898; two giant Galapagos Island tortoises re-
ceived in 1898; a brown pelican, 1899; and an anaconda, a gift from
the Governor of the State of Pard, Brazil, received in 1899.

Some other old-time residents still living in the park, with years
of arrival, are: Yakutat bear and king vulture, 1900; polar bear
and California condor, 1901; yak, black stork, and two roseate cock-
atoos, 1902; Kadiak bear, emu, European white pelican, two Cali-
fornia condors, and sacred ibis, 1903; rhesus monkey, sloth bear,
Somaliland ostrich, Australian crane, and European raven, 1904;
Polar bear, crowned crane, and European white pelican, 1905;
American bison, red deer, red-and-blue-and-yellow macaw, lesser
vasa parrot, and Indian white crane, 1906. There are numerous
records of other animals still living in the park of which the man-
agement is very proud.

Certain North American animals have always been difficult to
keep in zoological gardens; just why is not always exactly clear, as
some of their exotic relatives are frequently among the easiest of
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 955

species to maintain. The National Zoological Park has some good
records for certain of these species, including one of a mule deer that
lived in the collection for 138 years 10 months and 26 days; a Colum-
bian black-tailed deer for 11 years 2 months and 22 days; a New-
foundland caribou for 9 years 10 months and 17 days; and a prong-
horn antelope for 5 years 4 months and 15 days.

Some other interesting longevity records in the files include a
harpy eagle (7hrasaétos harpyia), 17 years 10 months 26 days; great
black-backed gull (Larus marinus), 17 years 4 months 22 days;
Steller’s sea lion (Humetopias jubata), 17 years 3 months; gray
wolf (Canis nubilus), 16 years 3 months 5 days; northern wild cat
(Lynx uinta), 15 years 3 months 27 days; and a wandering tree
duck (Dendrocygna arcuata), 15 years 21 days. A female South
American tapir lived in the park for 20 years and 10 days, during
which time nine young were born from her, seven of which were

successfully reared.
WHERE THE ANIMALS COME FROM

Many visitors take a collection of living animals for granted;
they never seem to wonder where the specimens are obtained or how
they reach the park. They are familiar with the zoological gardens
in numerous cities, visit and enjoy them frequently, have their
favorites among the various animals, and take it all as a matter-of-
fact provision for the enjoyment and education of themselves and
their children. In conversation with such persons they frequently
admit that they have never wondered much about it, but suddenly
become greatly interested. “How do you get all these animals?”
they at once want to know.

While some living animals are received from all sorts of unex-
pected sources, by far the greater number of those on exhibition come
through regular channels—the importing dealers. A native lad in
India, Africa, or South America captures a young animal and keeps
it as a pet, just as many American country boys do; eventually this
animal and others find their way into the hands of traders in some
seaport; they are bought by the agents of importers or by indepen-
dent animal buyers and eventually land in New York or San Fran-
cisco in the establishments of the dealers. Large stores, warehouses,
and “ farms” are maintained by these dealers and some long-estab-
lished firms are engaged in the animal business in various large sea-
port cities of the world. New York and San Francisco -dealers
import the bulk of the animals received in the American trade. Ani-
mals are purchased by agents of these firms in large or small lots
from smaller dealers or natives in all parts of the world, shipments
are assembled, and, accompanied by expert keepers, are carried to
256 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

the receiving port. From here they are scattered to retail dealers,
zoological gardens, private fanciers, and shows throughout the coun-
try.

A large part of this trade consists of canary birds, parrots, and
other popular cage birds and pets, but some very large shipments
are made up almost entirely of larger mammals, reptiles, and rare
and unusual birds. Some of the largest shipments received in the
United States have been brought by traders who travel about, from
country to country, buying and selling such wild animals as they
can secure. The capital required for such trading is large and the
risks are great. Only a few of the most expert and energetic of
men are able to carry on such a roving business successfully without
the added regular trade in staple species enjoyed by the regularly
established dealers.

The National Zoological Park, through its parent organization, the
Smithsonian Institution, receives numerous animals as gifts to the
United States Government from foreign governments and scientific
societies, and from American consuls stationed in out-of-the-way
regions. The original act of Congress, in which the National Zo-
ological Park was placed under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution, authorized and directed the heads of executive depart-
ments of the Government to “ cause to be rendered all necessary and
practicable aid” to the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution in
the acquisition of collections for the Zoological Park. Especially
fine collections of rare and valuable animals have been received
through the efforts of American consuls and through transfer from
bureaus of other executive departments. Numerous animals pre-
sented by other governments or by individuals to the President of
the United States have been transferred to the park. Notable col-
lections of this kind were the gifts of rare animals sent by the late
Emperor Menelik of Abyssinia to President Roosevelt. A magnifi-
cent Somaliland ostrich, included among these gifts from Menelik
in 1904, is, by the way, still living in the collection. The Canadian,
New Zealand, and other Governments have sent shipments of de-
sirable animals not otherwise obtainable. Patriotic American
travelers in foreign lands frequently collect or purchase strange
animals and bring or ship them to the National Zoological Park.
Many animals are received in exchange from other gardens, often
through the importers or dealers, who can readily handle the sur-
plus stock reared in the park. Certain reliable animal firms in San
Francisco and New York receive and care for shipments of ani-
mals for the National Zoological Park. The animals are in such
cases usually given a period of rest and special treatment before
being forwarded on to Washington.
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 257

Through the courtesy of the express companies, shipments of liv-
ing animals for the National Zoological Park often are given special
care in transit, and, if desirable, telegraphic instructions are sent
agents along as route. Different animals require different treat-
ment on arrival at the park. Some may be liberated at once in the
inclosures while others are kept in special retired quarters for short
or long periods of rest and general adjustment to the surroundings
and climate. In any case the newly arrived individuals have almost
continuous observation for a few days, and all sorts of emergencies
are prepared for. In exceptional cases such animals may be kept
in retirement for months before they are finally, in the very best of
condition, placed on exhibition to the public.

Certain kinds of animals from certain countries are, from time to
time, subject to quarantine or even embargo. This is owing to out-
breaks of stock diseases in foreign countries, all of which are
promptly reported to the proper American authorities. For months,
or even years, at a time it may be impossible to import directly
from some foreign district ruminant or other animals subject to a
specific disease. Some heart-breaking experiences result from these
very necessary regulations, and excessively rare animals, never be-
fore or since obtainable, have been lost on account of ae But
zoological garden officials are just as anxious as the stock breeders
to keep animal diseases out of the country and are, or should be,
ready at all times to cooperate with the quarantine division. So
far, happily, no outbreak of any stock disease in this country has
been traced to a zoological garden.

PRACTICAL LESSONS IN KINDNESS TO ANIMALS

In the modern, up-to-date zoological garden may be seen the
finest examples of “kindness to animals.” The men engaged in the
work are selected for their feelings toward animals. Kindness and
devoted attention are essential in maintaining their charges in health.
No cruel, brutal, or inhuman act would be tolerated in any well-
conducted zoo, and employees who do not show a thoroughly deep-
seated or natural love for animals and an absolute freedom from
“temper” are promptly released or transferred to work other than
in the animal division.

There are, of course, some few good citizens who object on general
principles to animals being kept in captivity. As a rule these peo-
ple are not familiar with the facts or with conditions in our modern
zoological gardens. We have known the most pronounced antizoo-
fanatics to become completely converted after a day in the Na-

tional Zoological Park, under the private guidance of an animal-
‘loving employee, and to become much interested and sympathetic
258 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

thereafter in the work of the zoo. It is hard to understand the
reasoning of a fanatical “animal lover” that would rather see ani-
mals killed than captured and made pets for the instruction and
amusement of thousands of other equally good animal lovers. The
extremists, who wish to abolish zoos, do not tell us what is to be
done with these pet animals, and apparently have never considered
the saving, by methods of domestication, of species doomed other-
wise to extinction.

A recent outbreak against the zoological gardens had to do with
the exhibition of specimens of the American eagle. At a meeting
of one of the societies concerned with such matters, according to
newspaper reports, it was argued that it is “ unpatriotic and incon-
sistent to imprison for life the noble bird that has been chosen to
typify the proud, free, and lofty spirit of America.” It was further
urged “that the eagles in captivity at the National Zoological Park
and other places be liberated.” Now, the eagles in the National
Zoological Park have been almost invariably rescued from death. The
park does not encourage the capture of eagles and always advises
against the destruction of the birds or their nests. These that we
have on exhibition have been trapped or shot, and we have taken
them and brought them back to health. Were they liberated, it is
certain that they would be promptly shot. The hand of almost
every man is against the eagle, the bird is without legal protection
in most States, and in some places bounties are actually paid for its
destruction. Almost everyone shoots or traps an eagle whenever
possible, and the wonder is that the bird exists as a wild creature in
America to-day. Egg hunters know virtually every nest in many
parts of the United States and rob them from year to year. The
eagles in the zoo are seen and admired by millions of visitors who
would never see a live eagle, especially at short range, in all their
lives in any other way. They are regularly used as models by
artists, and hundreds of photographs and drawings have been made
of them in the years past, both by ornithologists and engravers.
The beautiful eagles on our Government bills and bonds have been
made directly from these very birds. What is needed is not protec-
tion for the eagles in the zoological gardens, but for the eagles left
in a wild state. If the societies so distressed over the eagles in
captivity would only join forces with the officials of our most promi-
nent zoological gardens, who are doing all in their power to obtain
legal protection for the eagles, they would indeed be doing some
practical good in the cause of the wild creatures.

When one considers how rapidly the wild animals are being
exterminated from the face of the earth, and what cruel methods
are employed in hunting and trapping for meat, furs, hides, and oil,
and how man’s use of the land is depriving whole species of all
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK——HOLLISTER 959

their range, it is easy for the well-informed animal lover to feel
satisfied that the life of a contented, breeding family of animals
in a zoo paddock is preferable to a fearsome struggle against un-
beatable odds and certain extermination in a wild state.

BEHIND THE SCENES IN THE ZOO

Almost everyone is familiar with what is to be seen in the zoolog-
ical garden from without the guard rails. Something of the activi-
ties behind the scenes may be interesting. Take, for example, the
cook house. Here the chef in charge gives out to each keeper the
ration for the day: Hot boiled rice from the fireless cooker for
the morning feed of the monkeys; specially baked bread for the
bears, carefully taken from the rack of day-before-yesterday’s
baking; hard-boiled eggs, fruits, vegetables, milk, meats, and fish.
With about 1,700 animals of nearly 500 different species to care for,
the head keeper and the property clerk must supply the chef and other
assistants a great variety of foodstuffs. While hay, grain, and
meat naturally form the great bulk of this provision supply, most
of the articles of food used in the average home are at some time,
even if only in small quantity, used for the animals in the zoo.

A large garden, operated in connection with the park, supplies
kale, spinach, lettuce, Swiss chard, and beet tops. The lawn clip-
pings are all eaten by the ruminants and waterfowl, and trimmings
from trees—the leaves, bark, and small twigs—are used by the brows-
ing animals. An orchard has been set out and it is expected that
soon all of the apples that can be used will be grown in the park.

Each man in charge of some special kinds of animals visits the
food house and sees to the proper preparation of the day’s food for
his charges. The meat is cut, fish trimmed, vegetables, fruits, and
stale bread chopped in electric choppers; bone is ground. Almost
any kind of food may be requisitioned by the keepers in an emer-
gency. One keeper in charge of the ostrichlike birds was having
difficulties with a sick cassowary. All food was refused by the bird.
The keeper, a man of great experience, asked for a few pounds of
Malaga grapes. These were promptly supplied, the patient was
pleased, and a rare specimen worth many hundreds of dollars was
soon “back on his feed” again.

The market truck visits the wholesale market of the city early
each morning, returning to the park about 10.30 a.m. The special
requirements for the day, which may include almost any delicacy,
even to Malaga grapes or oranges, are included with the regular
day’s supply of perishable staple foods.

Some of the animals must be fed several times a day; some, like
" the lions, tigers, and other big cats, only once a day six days in the

260 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

week, with one day out of seven of complete fasting. Some of the
reptiles eat: only once every month or two. Some young animals
inust be fed throughout the night; always, there are two experienced
animal men on duty at all hours of the night to look out for these
special charges or for new arrivals that the stork may bring. Cu-
viously enough, a fine large European stork in the park once died
the day after the birth of a baby hippopotamus.

One of the great problems in the zoo is to keep people from feed-
ing the animals. Unfortunately, as much as people like to do this,
the officers in charge must frown on the practice. Sickness and even
death are not infrequently due to such acts of mistaken kindness on
the part of visitors. Peanuts are not the best of food for all animals,
especially in such quantities as would be furnished on a day of large
attendance, were the keepers and guards lax in their duties. It is
particularly distressing to see a person take a bite from a piece of
cake or fruit, remove it from his mouth, and toss it to a rare and
(lelicate monkey. If such miscellaneous feeding were allowed the
death rate among those animals especially susceptible to the con-
tagious diseases would unquestionably be greatly increased. Cer-
tain native plants are highly poisonous to some of the animals, so
that it is not entirely safe to allow uninformed visitors to pass green
food into the inclosures. I am sure that every zoological garden
man in America would be glad if every visitor refrained from toss-
ing anything whatever into a cage or paddock.

In addition to the animal division and the office force the Zoologi-
cal Park must, of a necessity, employ gardeners, mechanics, police,
laborers, and attendants. The grounds must be planted and kept
in order, the Government’s property and the visitors must be pro-
tected, and repairs must be made to buildings, cages, walks, and
roads. The main exhibition buildings are economically heated from
a central plant, and around this plant are grouped the machine
shop, blacksmith shop, paint shop, and carpenter shop. Repairs in-
volving the security of animals or the safety of visitors can not be
delayed, and are sometimes immediately urgent.

The expert mechanics on the list of permanent employees are
able to do almost any kind of construction work in wood and metal,
and almost all of the mechanical work done in the park—from the
construction of a building to the making of an automobile road—is
done by the regular force with the assistance of such temporary
laborers as may be required.

THE RECORDS

Every animal received at the National Zoological Park is cata-
logued, given a serial number, and further recorded on a large filing
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 261

card. The name, sex, age, history so far as known, and condition
are all entered. The subsequent history of the animal is recorded
on the back of its card so that the records of accidents, sickness,
births, or any other important incident in its life are readily ascer-
tained. On the removal of the animal by death, exchange, or for
other reason the final chapter in its life in the zoo is entered on the
card and the card is transferred from the file of living exhibits to
the permanent file of past residents of the park. If the animal dies,
the cause of death, with the autopsy report, is entered with the final
record. The information thus readily available on any animal or
group of animals kept in the park since its foundation is often of
great importance, and the value of the complete records increases
from year to year.

In every community of 1,600 or 1,700 people, some one is pretty
likely to be ill. It isso in the zoo. Every day each animal is care-
fully observed and any signs of illness are promptly reported to
the head keeper. Most of the ailments are slight, and prompt re-
covery follows proper attention. If necessary, the animal is removed
to the hospital building for isolation and better facilities for treat-
ment. Always there are deaths, but the rate is very low, and, as
mentioned before, many species are kept long beyond the usual period
of life for a wild animal. Old age is protected and prolonged in the
zoo; in the wild state all animals past their prime are liable to tragic
ends.

NESTS AND NESTING HABITS OF THE AMERICAN
EAGLE*

By Irancis H. Herrick

Western Reserve University, Cleveland, Ohio

[With 3 plates]

It

In northern Ohio the fringe of forest along the southern shore of
Take Erie has long been the haunt of the American or white-headed
eagles (Haliwetus leucocephalus). They were here before the white
man dispossessed the Indian, and here many have remained, in spite
of all the changes which he has wrought in the forests and upon the
shore, undismayed if not undisturbed by his incessant activities
afield; until, unless an active war has been waged against them, they
have come to show no fear of the once novel sights and sounds of an
advancing civilization, and for the most part they have come to dis-
regard them utterly, ever trusting to their inherent powers of cir-
cumspection for their own safety, to their physical prowess, their
adaptability and to their marvelous speed in the air.

The lake country was no doubt favored by the eagles because of
the almost never failing supply of fish to be found in most seasons
either at the surface or stranded upon the beach, a supply now greatly
augmented at certain points by rejects from the pound and gill nets
of fishermen.

The favorite nesting trees of this region are the sycamore and
the shellbark hickory; and that the dying or dead of these and other
species are repeatedly chosen by the same pair of birds must, no
doubt, be ascribed to habit, determined in the first instance by the
need of a safe approach to the aerie, and of an unobstructed out-
look from its spacious summit. When one of the branches which

The ‘ bald’”’ or white-headed eagle was adopted as the sign of the independence and
sovereignty of the United States by vote of the National Congress on June 20, 1782.
Although the golden eagle (Aquila chrysaetos) is also found within our limits, being now
confined mainly to the territory west of the Mississippi River, it seems appropriate and
‘would certainly be convenient to designate our national bird as “The American eagle,”
and to make the popular use of this term exactly discriminative of the species.

on at once a new and livelier interest; for then the birds can shift
readily from nest to perch,or back againto thenest,andtohave the
whole family at dinner may bea daily experience. It is possible that a
sound tree, when long occupied, might suffer and finally languish
under the ever growing mass of vegetable decay which it is usually
called upon to sustain. This was apparently the case with the nest
tree at Vermilion, Ohio, about which our interest will be mainly
centered in subsequent articles; though somewhat broken at the top,
there was enough foliage about this great nest in 1922 to seriously
hamper observations; in the following spring, to our great surprise,
the flow of sap suddenly failed and, except upon a single branch at a
height of barely 20 feet, the life of this tree went out. Other hickory
trees in the same grove, though unencumbered, have also died, and
during the spring gales of the present year many were broken or
overthrown, so we can record only the fact, while the relation of
cause and effect remains in doubt.

So far as I have observed, the nest tree is seldom at first completely
isolated, but commonly stands on the border of woods or in an open
grove, a mile or more from the lake, and it often 1ises to such a
height as to command the entire neighborhood. I have known one
instance where the surrounding timber was cut away, but a kindly
farmer spared the eagles’ tree, and its great aerie, borne aloft and
visible for miles in certain directions, stood out like a castle on a hill.

What has just been said would not apply to island nests, and in
our studies of the eagle experience is ever warning us against in-
dulgence in the easy path of generalization; not only must we expect
to find much variation in habit among different individuals, but also
in the same individuals at different times, for habit in this sense is
the result of experience. Most eagles are great place holders, and we
have recorded the instance at Vermilion in which the same aerie has
been occupied for upward of 34 years without a break, and the im-
mediate region for nearly a century; while other individuals, bent
possibly upon improving their condition with respect to the food
supply, their safety or that of their aerie, seem to be constantly on
the move. Thus, a pair at Danbury, Ohio, have moved three times
in five years, and I have known a deserted aerie to be reclaimed after
an interval of one or more years, presumably by the original owners.
At Kelley’s Island a number of nests are in open pastures, and in at
least one instance the site is so poorly chosen as to suggest the work
of inexperienced builders. On an island in the Pacific, 50 miles
south of San Pedro, known as San Clemente, Breninger’? found
two ground nests of this eagle in February, 1903; they were placed

THE AMERICAN EAGLE—HERRICK 965

on either side of a deep gorge, and were said to have been used
in alternation by the same birds for the space of 15 years; the one
on a large rock a mile from the north end of the island then con-
tained two eggs; while the other, on a hillside amid grass, was then
in disuse; the latter was so high that a man standing beside it
could not see into its shallow top.

When the site is well chosen the nest is securely held in the grasp
of a number of spreading branches. Possibly any tree offering
such conditions might be taken, but I have seen only the sycamore,
the hickory, and the elm thus used, and the fact that a given pair
of eagles will sometimes favor the same kind of tree for a number
of successive nests is a strong argument for the force of habit.
Where the upright branches are nearly vertical, the nest, as in that
formerly at North Springfield, Ohio, gradually assumes a cylin-
drical form (pl. 1); where the spread is greater, the aerie takes
the cup form and later that of the wineglass or tall inverted cone
(pl. 2) ; in an exceptional case at Kelley’s Island, to be later noticed,
the aerie was remarkably symmetrical and in shape of a huge bowl
over 7 feet in diameter (pl. 3); but it should be noted that such
comparisons apply to the exterior only, since “ cup” and “bowl” are
here solid to nearly the brim; indeed, in certain cases no concavity
exists, but the aerie is markedly convex at the top. The diameter
of a new as of an old nest will depend, as I have intimated, upon
the angle of divergence of its main supports, but in a number of
instances observed the first year’s nest measured 5 feet across the
top and its height was approximately the same.

A nest of the first year consists of a great mass of sticks, gathered
mainly from the ground, borne to the nest site in one or both talons
by either bird, and laid individually with aid of the bill; as this
mass of fagots grows, greater attention is paid to the periphery,
where the coarser materials are more carefully and more effectively
interlaid and adjusted; the center and interstices are filled with
dead weeds, cornstalks, and stubble, with incidentally considerable
earth introduced with pieces of sod and with weeds. It is no wonder
that with the growth of years the core of such a structure comes to
form a sodden mass of vegetable mold. The largest sticks which I
have taken from different nests were a yard long and 2 inches thick,
but many which I saw in a nest at Kelley’s Island this summer
appeared to have a length of over 6 feet. I am not yet ready to speak
of the act of nest building in detail, but examination clearly indi-
cates that such sticks are mainly gathered from the ground. The
owner of the land on which the nest at North Springfield was situ-
-ated told me of having seen his eagles in nesting time fly against
the dead branch of a tree and, as it snapped with a sharp report,
266 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

bear it off to the aerie; if such statements are true, the eagle clasps
the branch in its talons and breaks it off by sheer force as the fish
hawk is known to do, an easy matter for birds of their weight and
strength. The Vermilion eagles at a later phase of nest life would
now and again bring in their talons a cluster of living oak twigs
and lay them upon the nest, a curious habit, the meaning of which
will be considered in another place.

Eagles are supposed to be mated for life, and that when one is
bereft it goes in search of a new mate. So far as known its quest is
invariably successful, though it may return with a bird in juvenal
dress. This loss and substitution of a mate occurred at the Ver-
milion nest when one of the pair was shot, but this was some years
ago, and the exact circumstances could not be determined. It may
be doubted if either parent would desert or leave for long their
young when well started on the road of development; on the other
hand we might expect a lone bird to abandon its eggs per force
and, if again mated, to begin a new nesting cycle upon its return;
but whether this has actually happened or not can not be stated.
Since at least three years are passed before acquiring the perfect
coloring—white head, neck, and tail, and yellow bill—and since
young birds without doubt become sexually mature the first spring
after birth, one may expect to occasionally find one in brown or
juvenal dress mated to a full-colored bird; and Hoxie* mentions
a case in Chatham County, Ga., in which both birds were in imma-
ture plumage, though the female was then beginning to show
distinct traces of white in the tail; the nest in this instance was
in process of building on March 6, 1909, but according to this
observer it did not contain young until May 17. The incubation
period was given as 83 days, and the time from hatching to flight
as 42 days. Fresh eggs were said to be found in that section from
mid-November to late March. Two cases were also mentioned,
at Savannah, in which this eagle laid a second set of eggs after
having been robbed of her first; in the one instance the first set
was taken on December 5, and in the other on the 12th of the
same month. There is a similar record for Lincoln County, Me.,*
where the eagles held to their aerie after being repeatedly robbed,
‘and in all probability they made their losses good. In this instance
the nest was in a tall dead pine, and what is more important it was
lined with green pine boughs, the possible significance of which will
be noticed at a later time. Two partially incubated eggs were taken
from this nest on April 7, 1891, and three, in which the development

THE AMERICAN EAGLE—HERRICK 267

was far advanced, on the 16th of the same month of the succeeding
year. The following happened at the Vermilion nest: A collector
ascended the tree and removed the first set of two slightly incubated
eggs on or about March 18, 1920, after which a second set was laid
me the young reared in due course. I have not yet definitely deter-
mined the exact period of incubation at Vermilion, being unwilling
to interfere in any way with the process until our observations on
all later phases of nest life were reasonably complete. From what
was seen this year, however, I am satisfied that the incubation did
not exceed four weeks.

It is commonly said that eagles, when once settled down, occupy
the “same nest” year after year; it would be more exact to say
that the eagle builds anew each year, but uses the old nest as a
site for the new one. Like most other birds, it satisfies its building
instinct at a certain time every year, but, unlike most, it is chained
to a certain spot, which is its old nest. As a result of these yearly
increments the eagle’s aerie gradually rises in height and, since it
must meet the spread of its main supports, it may increase steadily
in diameter often, as we have seen, taking the form of an inverted
cone or balloon, flat at last the nest tree collapses under its ever
increasing burden Such a structure from the standpoint of the
student, if not of the builder, is thus a compound or storied nest;
it niet be compared to a stack of saucers, each of which represents
a “nest,” or a unit which is yearly added to the pile, but becomes so
completely incorporated with what precedes as to be thereafter insep-
arable from it.

II

Of some eight nests of the American eagle which I have examined
in the south shore region of Lake Erie, two were at North Spring-
field, two at Danbury, and three at Kelley’s Island, besides that at
Vermilion, the most remarkable of them all.

While traveling on the Lake Shore Railroad some years ago I
happened to notice an eagle’s nest from the car window not a thou-
sand feet from the line at a point near Girard, in Pennsylvania; as
this nest appeared to be of unusual size and occupied the top of a
dead truncated tree which stood quite alone, it aroused my curiosity.
After learning that this great aerie had long been a landmark of
that region, being well known apparently to every workman upon the
read, I resolved to pay it a visit. Upon reaching Girard in the fol-
lowing June I found to my keen regret that the old sycamore with its
famous nest had gone down in a gale of the previous winter, but from
photographs*® made before its fall (pl. 1), together with measure-

268 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

ments which it was then possible to secure upon the ground, I am
able to give its exact dimensions. It was 9 feet in height and had a
nearly uniform diameter of 6 feet; according to report it had been
occupied for 15 years, and its top, as I found, had originally stood
at a height of 77 feet from the ground. The nest was essentially
wedged between two upright branches, though receiving some support
from a smaller division of the main stem which at the base attained
a diameter of 314 feet; its two main supports were broken off at a
height of 6 feet from the top of the aerie and served the eagles as
favorite perches and lookout points; the nest was a great mass of
wattled or intercrossed sticks, made solid with earth and the result-
ant decay of the annual additions of weeds, stubble, and straw.

For many years these eagles were said to have occupied a dead
sycamore in the midst of woods in Milesgrove, Pa.; when this aged
tree succumbed, the more famous nest, which we have described, was
established in another sycamore, also dead, at North Springfield just
over the line, in Ohio, in 1885; this lasted, as we have seen, 15
years, or until January, 1900. The third nest was started in the
spring of that year at a point not many rods from the site of the
second and again in a sycamore, but this time in a living and sound
one. This tree had a girth of 12 feet at the ground and a clean
straight bole without a branch for 60 feet; at this point it spread a
number of strong arms which formed an all-embracing niche for
a nest of great size. No doubt it was this great crotch which had
attracted the eagles, though close beside it rose a stately tulip tree,
the branches of which met those of the sycamore and partly over-
shadowed them.

Upon approaching this nest on the 8th day of June not a sound
was heard for full 20 minutes, when suddenly one of the eagles
appeared, whose behavior suggested the male bird, and circling over-
head, began to sound his peculiar alarm, which I have heard many
times since. It may be transliterated as kar! kar! kar! with some-
times the suggestion of a final & at the end of each syllable, or again
as cac-cac-cac! Then, alighting in the topmost branch of a dead
tree, he expressed his emotion in a manner characteristic of many
birds even as remote of kin as the nighthawk; with depressed head
and neck outstretched, with drooped and quivering wings, his man-
dibles would open and close with the regularity of clockwork. Dr.
William L. Ralph® was always able to recognize the male by this
alarm, the call of the female being more harsh and often broken.
The female was sitting in her aerie during the time of our approach,
as became evident when she suddenly left it and with protesting

THE AMERICAN EAGLE-——HERRICK 969

screams soared over the tree tops; neither bird would come to the
nest while I was in the neighborhood. At this time there were two
eaglets, in full feather but quite invisible from below, except as one
would appear and shoot a white stream well over the edge of the
nest. At the Vermilion nest we did not hear the alarm call after
the last week of May in 1922; not once was it sounded within hear-
ing during our long vigil beginning early in June and lasting until
the flight of the young eagles in early July. Silence also seemed to
be the rule during the present season, and it was possible for us to
determine the female only by her slightly greater size and more sin-
ister countenance. We noticed, however, that whenever an observer
showed himself upon our platform, passed under one of the perches,
or approached the observatory tree, either eagle, if present, would
crane its neck in his direction, open and close the mandibles, and if
uttering any sound at all, biting it off so effectually that it was
scarcely audible at a distance of 80 feet.

Two nests which I examined at Danbury, on July 5, 1922, and-
which were occupied successively by the same pair of birds, were
markedly convex at the top, but whether this peculiarity was due to
a habit or whim of the builders or, as seemed more likely, to a
lack of suitable supports at the margin of the nests, could not be
determined. I am able to give a partial history of these nests
through the efforts of Mr. W. G. Tibbels to save the eaglets from
community vengeance. The farmers in their vicinity, it seems. had
lost a number of their chickens and were bent on keeping the eagle
population down. The first nest to be built and occupied stood at
a height of about 70 feet in the top of a dead shellbark hickory on
the edge of woods, about midway between Sandusky Bay and the
lake; it was rather more than 6 feet tall and measured 434 feet
across the top. Mr. Tibbels climbed to this nest at about the middle
of June for three years in succession, 1919-1921, and removed the
young, his plan being to hold them until they were able to fly
and then release them. The old eagles, he told me, behaved in
essentially the same way each time he raided their aerie; they would
swoop down at him with talons extended as if about to strike, but
they always swerved when 6 feet or more away and would eventu-
ally settle in the top of neighboring trees where, with opening and
closing mandibles, they gave vent to their alarms. They did not
leave the vicinity while he was at the nest. On one of these visits
the aerie was strewn with the carcasses of muskrats, rabbits, chick-
ens, and fish, including the half-decomposed body of a large carp;
two of the muskrat skeletons carried each a steel trap, which might
indicate that these rodents had been taken outside of the nesting
270 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

season, or at least not long after the beginning of March, and that
the aerie served its owners as an habitual dining table.

In the spring of 1921, according to Mr. Tibbels, the Danbury
eagles were seen carrying nest materials to a new site a mile away,
while they continued to hold to their first nest described above;
this was finally abandoned at the close of that season, probably
not because of the repeated raids which had been made upon it,
but rather on account of the insecurity of the nest itself, which
had lost a main supporting branch. At the time of our visit it
was sagging over the stump of this lost limb and appeared as if
ready to topple over in the next storm. At all events the new
nest was completed and occupied in the spring of 1922 upon the site
which had been determined the previous year. This second nest
was also in a dead hickory that stood on the border of woods and,
although barely elevated above the surrounding tree tops, it afford-
ed a good outlook. The tree was less than 2 feet in its greatest
diameter and the nest, which was estimated to stand at a height
of about 75 feet from the ground, was approximately 5 feet tall
and would measure as much or slightly less across the top. When
Mr. Tibbels climbed to another nest about the 1st of May, he found
the top strongly convex, as in the former case, and three eggs lying
close together in a depression that was evidently made by the laying
bird. On this occasion the old eagles, contrary to what might have
been expected, made no hostile demonstrations, but kept the climber
in sight while they were perched in neighboring trees.

As we approached this second nest on the 5th of July, about
seven weeks later, one of the old eagles stood guard above it and
soon went off in silence, but a young bird that was resting or pos-
sibly feeding in the aerie itself remained until we were close upon
the tree. We found that the two eaglets, which had been on the
wing for upward of a week, were still in the habit of returning to
the aerie either alone or in the company of their parents.

The unpopularity of these particular eagles evidently had not
abated, for an attempt had been made to fire their nest tree;
whether they were eventually driven out or not, I do not know,
but, according to Mr. Tibbels, they again abandoned their aerie in
the spring of the present year, and moving across the peninsula,
settled 8 miles to the northwest at Port Clinton.

On July 2, my assistant, Mr. E. J. Humel, and I visited Kelley’s
Island, which lies 10 miles due north from Sandusky, and is only
less famous for its eagles than for its extensive limestone quarries
and its world-renowned glacial grooves. The eagles now frequent
the semiwild eastern half of the island, which is 3 miles long by 2
broad. We visited three nests in the short time at our disposal and
HERRICK OTR

THE AMERICAN EAGLE

a later and more careful search revealed no others.’ All of the nests
which we examined were said to have been recently occupied, but
they were abandoned at the time of our visit and not an eagle was
seen on the island. Our arrival happened to coincide with that of
the well-known annual pest of mayflies or “Canada soldiers,” which
come suddenly, remain a week or less, and as suddenly depart. It is
no exaggeration to say that, after leaving the roads, we were ham-
pered at every step by these extraordinary creatures which covered all
exposed objects; all standing room seemed to be taken on every
spear of grass, on every twig and leaf; the very bark of the trees,
great and small, being “furred” by them; and as we walked they
swarmed up in such incredible numbers over our bodies as to almost
blind us. It was difficult to keep the lens of our camera clear of
them long enough to take a photograph.

All the nests which we saw were in open pastures; the first to
be visited, on the northeast side of the island, stood in the top
of a decrepit elm at a height of about 75 feet; it was of the cup
form, perhaps 8 feet tall and 6 feet or more across the top. A
farmer, engaged in spraying his grapes near by, informed us that
it had been abandoned and again reoccupied the present season.
Another nest, farther to the south and east, was also in a living
elm, which was 12 feet in girth and stood some 1,200 feet from a
roadway. It appeared to be very insecurely placed at a height of
about 60 feet and was evidently a nest of the first year, measuring
hardly more than 5 feet either way and remarkable only for its
asymmetry and the great length of many of the sticks which entered
into its mass.

The second nest that we visited, at a point a little to the south
of the first, was so remarkable that the sight of it alone amply
rewarded us for all our trouble and annoyance with insects. It
crowns a remarkably small shellbark hickory (pl. 3), about a foot
and a half in diameter at its base and living in every branch, the
lowermost being within reach from the ground so that a good climber
should be able to make the ascent without much difficulty and by
the aid of a cord to surmount the aerie. We were told that not
long ago a man had made this attempt, but was attacked so viciously
that he quickly had a change of heart. This nest is remarkable for
is symmetrical bowl shape, as well as for its proximity to the ground ;
according to our later estimates, it is 6 feet tall and over 714 feet

TI visited the island again on Apr. 12-13, 1924, in company of my friend Prof. H. W.
Mountcastle, who ascended the tree in which the bowl-shaped nest herein shown was
placed and obtained data for the correction of our earlier estimates of its dimensions and
height from the ground. At that time two of the nests were occupied, but, to our dis-
appointment, this last and most interesting of all had been abandoned.
272 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

across the top, and a line dropped from its base to the ground meas-
ured exactly 3714 feet. It is very evident that the unusual form of
this nest is due to the spread of its main supports, which diverge at
an angle of 70°. It should be noticed that the top of the aerie in this
instance is almost completely shaded by branches rising to a height
of 10 feet or more on all sides.

The history of the Vermilion eagles, the fullest of which I have
any records, and covering a period of over 80 years, is given in
detail in an earlier paper... During that time four nests have been
occupied for varying periods in the township of Vermilion, at points
a mile or more removed from the shore of the lake. The fourth
and present nest (pl. 2), which has been occupied for at least 34
years, stands at a height of 81 feet, in a shellbark hickory which,
as already noticed, was more or less alive up to the spring of 1923;
it was 12 feet tall and 81% feet across the top when exact measure-
ments were made on July 20, 1922. When examined at this time,
just 16 days after the young eagles were on wing, all carcasses of
fish, chickens, and other animals had been removed and its inside
depth did not exceed 4 or 5 inches; the eaglets, in the course of many
weeks of exercise, had trodden its surface nearly flat. At that time
all the surface material, to the amount of half a bushel or more,
was gathered up and lowered in a sack; this was found to consist of
fish and chicken bones in sparing amount, fish scales, short loose
sticks such as the young eagles had often been seen to use in their
play, fragments of cornstalks, clusters of oak twigs with the dried
green leaves still upon them, corresponding with what we had seen
the old eagles bring to their aerie, besides a miscellaneous assort-
ment of vegetable rubbish. Underlying this loose layer was a fairly
compact floor of vegetable mold, which extended some 2 or 3 feet
on all sides from the center of the nest and was easily dislodged
with the hand.

Though hoping to turn my attention to nest building and other
early phases of activity another year, I will now set down in brief
what happened at the Vermilion nest in the spring of 1923. When
Mr. Headline and his men were building the second platform of
our observatory on March 13-15, they were obliged to abandon
their work for a part of the time on account of severe gales, which
during that month brought down many trees in the grove and
threatened that of the eagles with destruction; accordingly, we
took the precaution of securing it as best we could by the aid of
steel wires. The eagles were engaged in building also, but, as Mr.

on Sn re ee ee ee ee

®The Auk, Vol. XL. 1923.
THE AMERICAN EAGLE—HERRICK 973

Headline reported, they paid little attention to the carpenters;
while one of the eagles would fly over the aerie and drop a bundle
of straw, cornstalks, or stubble, which it carried in its talons, the
other would dispose of it, remaining thus engaged for 15 or 20
minutes at a time; they had already built a barrier of sticks about
the margin and were now laying a mattress of straw and softer
materials over the center; when the carpenters finally returned to
finish their work on the 20th of March, this bedding was completed,
and one of the eagles, presumably the female, was sitting in its midst,
though not continuously while the men were there. We infer that
at least two eggs had then been laid, or were about to be laid, and
allowing the eagle two or three days for sitting on the nest before
actually producing an egg, the probable error as to the beginning
of incubation is not likely to be greater than this either way.

When I next visited the nest with Mr. Headline on April 6 incuba-
tion was well advanced; as we proceeded down the lane and entered
the grove not an eagle was to be seen, and in spite of our past experl-
ence it was impossible to repress the feeling that some mishap might
have befallen eggs or birds. We had not taken many steps in the
grove, however, before the male suddenly hove into view from the
east, wheeled and settled on one of his habitual perches in the woods.
This quickly dissipated our fears, and as we approached the nest
tree a white head rose from the top of the aerie, at its very center ;
with the binoculars we could see that head and neck were craned in
our direction, the better to follow our movements upon the ground;
as we reached the observatory tree she went off silently and joined
her mate on his tree-top perch. We then proceeded with our busi-
ness, raising a 12-foot ladder to the upper platform and mountmg
it there, in the hope that by its aid we might see the eggs in place,
as the eagle had left them. Since this platform rises 95 feet above
the ground, and 14 feet above the level of the nest, this ladder would
easily carry the eye 15 feet higher; but at even 29 feet above the top
of the aerie, we could not detect the eggs within it, so completely
were they concealed with the thick cover of straw and stubble. As
it is a slow, difficult and rather hazardous task to climb the nest tree,
we resolved to take no further risks with the eggs during the pres-
ent season. While on the upper platform at this time I saw an in-
teresting performance—the male eagle assailing the female, rising
above her, striking at her with talons extended, in anything but
an amorous manner, and apparently trying to induce her to return
to her eggs.

On April 21, two weeks later, I found both eagles standing on
their aerie, and at once concluded that the eggs had hatched; this
proved to be the case, for upon again ascending to our upper plat-
form we could see two eaglets, which from their appearance could
274 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

not have been out of the shell over three or four days, feebly raising
their fluffy heads above their warm bed of straw; we could only see
that they were well coated with grayish white down, and that their
bills were large and by contrast very black. Close to the young and
half buried in the straw lay the carcass of some animal which we
could not identify, but from the deep red color of the flesh we
suspected that it might be a rodent.

Although this eagle, as Audubon found by climbing repeatedly to
the nest, may sit for a number of days before laying is actually
begun, the incubation period could not have been far from four
weeks, or approximately from March 20 to April 17. Since eaglet
number one left its nest for the first time on June 27, and eaglet
number two on July 1, they remained continuously in the aerie about
71 and 74 days, respectively.

IV

The Vermilion eagles appear to leave their habitual breeding and
hunting grounds only when the usual food supplies give out. In
ordinary seasons, according to Mr. and Mrs. Buehring, they are
away only from six to eight weeks, or from mid-November to mid-
January; but in the season of 1921-22, which was one of the mildest
on record, they were missed for barely a fortnight in the latter part
of December. In the winter of 1922-23, which continued rather mild
until January, both birds remained in the neighborhood, and were
even seen resting on the nest itself at the very end of December.*®
That the use of the aerie as resting place and lookout point, by force
of habit, long outlasts the season of young, we know; by the same
token we might expect the adult eagles to form a strong attachment
to their home territory, and it may well be doubted if they ever
leave it except under the pressure of necessity; but in this as in most
other respects we should expect to find much individual variation,
for in a bird of so great a range which covers the entire continent,
the pressure referred to must be exerted in greatly varying degrees.

The young of most birds, when once out of their nest, are, as we
say, “out for good.” The slender thread, which binds them to
their cradle, is snapped at the moment of flight; for all such the
nest has suddenly lost its meaning or at least its function, and new
habits at once step in to dominate their after life; moreover, it is
the young, and not the nest, which is the strong magnet to which
the parents are drawn. With the eagle, in this respect also, the
case is somewhat different, for its young after their first flight
are prone to return to their nest, and this they continue to do for a
number of weeks, or for as long as they remain in the neighborhood.

beginning of this paper, virtually introduces a new element into
nest life, for it alters the behavior of the adults, and tends to pro-
long the time which the young spend at the aerie, as will be fully
explained at a later time.

So far as is known, young eagles are never permitted to use the
home territory for breeding purposes unless by chance, at some
future time, one should become mated to a ‘parent; according to
the testimony of other observers, after three weeks or more of semi-
independence, they are effectually driven off by the old birds, when
their powers of flight and of securing their own food have become
well established.

To return to the first Danbury nest: One of the three eaglets,
taken by Mr. Tibbels in June, 1921, was possibly killed and was
certainly eaten by the other two; at the time of our visit one of the
survivors, though 13 months old, had never acquired the necessary
coordination for independent flight, and was still a captive. Any-
one who was confirmed in the belief that the emblem of his country
was in real life a timid creature and a coward at heart would have
revised his opinions after having attempted to approach and manage
this bird. When, after cautious manipulation, it was finally released
and set free upon the grass, it would endeavor to escape by making
long leaps and flapping its powerful wings, but it never seemed able
to rise much above the ground. When it was headed off and frustrated
in these attempts it would rush swiftly at its assailant, endeavoring
to strike with its extended talons, and at the same time to deliver
swift blows with the wrists of its wings; when too hard pressed, it
would throw itself back, and with erected head feathers and open
mandibles, like a hawk in a similar predicament, it would strike
fiercely with both feet.

As regards the reputed timidity or cowardice of the eagle, or
indeed any other animal, it is impossible to speak with any degree
of fairness without due consideration of individual differences, as
well as of differences in the same individual under different con-
ditions. Probably few people would care to meet a lion in the
open, particularly if unprepared for such an encounter; yet a
recent traveler, who walked 3,000 miles across tropical Africa, from ~
coast to coast, has declared that the “king of beasts” is “a terrible
coward, unless it is starving or has been injured.” “TI have seen
lions,” he is reported to have said, “face to face, and the beasts
have raced away in terror.” The difficulty with the lion, as with the
eagle, is in knowing whether the interview has been correctly timed.
‘ Fear is an instinct which nature has bestowed rather freely for
the protection of the individual and the preservation of the race:
276 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

it often waxes or wanes, according to rather complex conditions,
being frequently suppressed by any stronger instinct in those ani-
mals usually regarded as timid; in birds it is commonly suppressed
by the instinct of guarding and pugnacity, which in many species
rises during the period of incubation, and like a fever, reaches a
climax not long after the young are hatched, and then gradually
subsides. Accordingly a “timid” animal under the spur of a single
instinct may at times become very bold, only to revert to its former
state.

In the case of the eagles, as in so many other instances, this is
further complicated by individual experience, for, in settled com-
munities where such birds do not always escape persecution, great
caution is often acquired; and their survival under difficult condi-
tions shows that it stands them in good stead. The presence or
absence of fear is thus clearly the resultant of many factors, of
which individual experience is an important variable. Any climber
who invades the eagle’s aerie, unprepared for an attack, especially
if the nest is placed low and in wild country, is liable to meet with
a surprise. At times the intruder has been badly frightened, and
fortunate in having only his hat snatched from his head; ?° at others,
perhaps, he has been menaced only, but at too close quarters for
personal comfort; again no hostile demonstrations whatever may
be made. There are always one or more independent and indeter-
minate variable factors to be reckoned with, and the issue will de-
pend on the character and experience of the individual bird.

Captain Bendire™ has recorded the experience of Dr. William L.
Ralph on the Indian River, Fla., which furnishes an interesting
commentary on what has just been said. This region, long famed
for its bird life, was described as a paradise for the eagle, at the
time of his visit in February, 1886, when with the aid of an assist-
ant he found nearly 100 occupied nests; most of these were in pine
trees, “ generally the highest and thickest that the birds could find,”
_and usually at a height of 50 or 60 feet, the extremes met with at
that point being 75 and 30 feet. Doctor Ralph could recall but one
instance of eagles attacking anyone; this was at a nest containing
two young but a few hours old and built in a large pine at Crescent

” Auk, Vol. XXI, p. 220. The eagles at the San Clemente Island nest, to which we
have already referred, were said to have had a bad reputation for viciousness. One
season at sheep-shearing time, according to this writer, an employee of the wool company
attempted to ride to the edge of the barraneca and take a look at the young eagles in their
rock nest; as he did so one of the old eagles swooped down upon him and snatched his
hat from his head, and flying off with it dropped it into the sea. At the time of his
visit the writer quoted approached the nest of the same bird and took a position close
to the edge of the abyss, gun in hand. He was accompanied by a small dog, which
crouched in terror beside him as he sat on the ground; in a moment one of the eagles
swept down upon him and came within a foot of striking him in the face.

Lake, where the birds would swoop down and almost strike the head
of his climber, and were so very savage that one of his party became
frightened, and, thinking that they might injure him, shot the
male, which was the fiercer of the two.

The same writer has given an interesting account by Capt. B. I’.
Goss of two nests of the eagle on small islands in Nueces Bay, near
Corpus Christi, Tex.; one of these, thought to be the work of an in-
experienced bird, was on an islet which did not rise over 2 feet
above high water. and was little more than a sand reef; the nest
“consisted simply of a few sticks laid on the bare ground, not
enough to make a single tier even, and these were covered with
bones, feathers, and fish scales.” The other nest, on an island but
little larger and bearing a small solitary tree, rose “like a monu-
ment” out of the water and was visible for miles. “It was built
with surprising regularity, appeared to be a perfect circle, and the
sides smooth and almost perpendicular. It was built of sticks, and
sloped slightly toward the center,” where he said an eaglet sat and
viciously snapped at him as he peered over the edge. Both parent
birds, he adds, “attacked us with great fury, screaming and striking
at us with their talons.” Later when an assistant was taking the
eggs from a tree nest, he continues: “he was set upon by both the
eagles, and if he had not had a good stick with which to defend
himself I feel sure they would have struck him.”

Precisely the same kind of variability which we have noticed in
the eagle, and apparently due to the same cause, may be seen in the
behavior of a robin, or even of a bluebird, under similar conditions.
Who would expect the ordinarily timid bluebird to attack a person
who approached its nest at any time or under any conditions? Yet,
I have known a male of this serene and gentle species to drive
straight at the head of an intruder, and with such speed and fiery
pugnacity that he involuntarily threw up his hands.

The Vermilion eagles were constantly pestered by one or more
kingbirds whenever, upon approaching or leaving the aerie, they
crossed their preserves. It is a familiar sight to see the doughty
kingbird pursuing an eagle, hawk, or crow, now and again darting
at them, pecking at their head or back and driving them from their
territory. The Vermilion kingbirds would pursue their supposi-
tious enemy up to the nest tree, and even alight upon its branches,
and there continue for some minutes their harsh notes of protest
close to the aerie. More than once during the present season I saw
one and sometimes two of these plucky birds follow an old eagle
to its tall perch, alight just above it, and as the spirit moved, dart
with vim at the greater tyrant sitting in unconcern but a few feet
away; at every lunge of the little kingbird the old eagle seemed

20397—25—_19
278 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

very much bored; with the glasses I could see that his mandibles
opened just a little at each thrust. In all such cases the eagle can
well afford to adopt a policy of indifference; but when a small hawk
at Vermilion this year tried the same tactics it met with a quick
surprise, for after dodging a number of times, the eagle opened its
talons and with one thrust suddenly stopped the game and barely
missed the hawk. Under certain conditions the eagle, as already
intimated, may appear to be wary, suspicious, and timid to the last
degree, but, as we have also seen, such conditions do not always
prevail. Both adult and young birds, when hard pressed on the
eround, or for any cause unable to fly, can put up a stiff fight against
any assailant.

THE BREEDING PLACES OF THE EEL*

By Jous. Scumipt, Ph. D., D. Se.

Director, Carlsberg Physiological Laboratory, Copenhagen; Member of the R.

[With 7 plates]

The problem of the propagation and breeding places of the com-
mon or fresh-water eel is one of great antiquity; from the days of
Aristotle naturalists have occupied themselves therewith, and in cer-
tain regions of Europe it has exercised popular imagination to a
remarkable degree. It is only during the last three decades, how-
ever, that any real results have been attained.

It has long been known that. the full-grown eels move down in
the autumn from their rivers and lakes to the sea; the most impor-
tant eel fisheries, indeed, are based upon this seaward migration.
The eels do not return again from the sea, but in early spring there
appear on the coasts myriads of small young eels, eagerly seeking
their way up to fresh water. These eel fry are known in most
countries of Europe, and occur in some parts in such quantities as
to form the object of a particular industry; for instance, in the
River Severn in England, where they are known as “elvers.” Un-
til 1896, the elver stage was the earliest stage of development in
which the eel was known on the shores of Europe, and it was gen-
erally supposed that the elvers arriving in the spring were the off-
spring of the eels which had migrated during the previous autumn.
They are not, however, altogether minute, like the newly hatched
larva of a cod or herring; on the contrary, they are no less than 6-7
em. in length.

We know then that the old eels vanish from our ken into the sea,
and that the sea sends us in return innumerable hosts of elvers.
But whither have they wandered, these old eels, and whence have

the elvers come? And what are the still younger stages like, which
precede the “elver” stage in the development of the eel? It is such
problems as these that constitute the “ eel question.”

The earliest possibilty of attacking this ancient problem scien-
tifically was afforded by the Italians Grassi and Calandruccio, of
whom the former published in 1896, in the “ Proceedings of the
Royal Society of London,” a report of their investigations at Mes-
sina, entitled: “ The Reproduction and Metamorphosis of the Com-
mon Kel (Anguilla vulgaris) .”

Grassi and Calandruccio found that the elver stage is preceded by
a larval stage, inasmuch as they were able to show that the little
fish from the Straits of Messina, described by Kaup in 1856 as Lep-
tocephalus brevirostris, is not an independent species, but the larva
of the eel. The larva is leaf-shaped, transparent as glass, and about
714 cm. in length. By a process of metamorphosis it is transformed
into the eel-shaped elver, a reduction in both height and length tak-
ing place.

This Italian discovery was of great importance; we had now
learned to know a stage still younger than the elver, and it did not
seem difficult from this to infer the remainder of the life-history of
the eel. Grassi was therefore justified in assuming that he had been
able “to dispel, in the most important points, the great mystery
which has hitherto surrounded the reproduction and the development
of the common eel (Anguilla vulgaris)” (loc. cit., p. 261). Even
after the discovery of the larva, however, certain points still seemed
vague; one might yet ask, for instance: (1) Why were not the larve,
like the elvers, found promiscuously about the shores of Europe,
but only in the waters of Southern Italy, especially the Straits of
Messina; and (2) why should we find in that water, not minute,
newly-hatched larve, but only specimens already fully grown, or
nearly so, of about 7 cm. in length?

Briefly, Grassi conceived the circumstances to be as follows: The
breeding grounds of the eel lie in the great depths of the sea—in the
abyssal region—which in the Mediterranean is not far from the
shores. In these depths the ova, suspended in the water, are devel-
oped, and here the larve live, normally without rising to the upper
water layers. The Straits of Messina, however, form an exception.
There are some peculiar currents here, that “tear up the deep-sea
bottom, which everywhere else is inaccessible” (loc. cit., p. 268) ;
hence, it is just in the Straits of Messina that these larve are brought
to the surface and come under observation.

This, roughly speaking, was the state of the eel question at the
commencement of the present century. In the year 1904 I was led
by chance to touch upon it myself. My very first investigations con-
firmed in every respect the Italian discovery of the eel larva and its
BREEDING PLACES OF THE EEL—SCHMIDT 281

transformation into the elver. I have not been able, however, to
confirm Grassi’s theory as to the origin, manner of life, and age, of
the larvee. Still, as I have said before, that theory might well appear
justified from the state of things at the time it was first advanced.

The Danish eel investigations were commenced, as mentioned, in
1904. I was then on board the research steamer 7’hor, engaged on
fishery investigations in the Iceland and Faroe waters, dee cndane to
the program of the International Council for the Study of the Sea.
In May, 1904, after towing a Petersen’s young-fish trawl near the
surface of the water, west of the Faroes, it was found, on examining
the contents of the net, that in addition to various other forms of
pelagic life, we had also captured a specimen of Leptocephalus bre-
virostris, TY cm. long.

Thus the larva of our eel was for the first time found outside the
Mediterranean. And the find, which was followed in the same
year by another, made by Mr. Farran from the steamship Helga, off
the west coast of Ireland, afforded a starting point for future investi-
gations. Owing to various circumstances it came about that Den-
mark, a country where eel fishing is a specially important industry,
was accorded the task of prosecuting the investigations further, and
it fell to my lot to take charge of the work.

I had little idea at the time of the extraordinary difficulties which
the task was to present, both in regard to procuring the most neces-
sary observations and in respect of their interpretation. Our work
on these eel investigations has now extended some seventeen. or
eighteen years, with a lengthy interruption occasioned by the recent
war. The task was found to grow in extent year by year, to a degree
we had never dreamed of; in fact, we have been obliged, in order to
procure the necessary survey material, to make cruises of investiga-
tion ranging from America to Egypt, from Iceland to the Cape Verde
Islands. And this work has been handicapped throughout by lack
of suitable vessels and equipment and by shortage of funds; indeed,
had it not been for the private support afforded from numerous
different sources, we should have had to relinquish the task long
since.

I propose now to give a brief survey of the results attained. They
are based on dry figures, representing measurements and other obser-
vations; yet, taken in conjunction, they give us at least the outline
of a life history which in point of interest is, I think, hardly sur-
passed by that of any other species in the animal kingdom.

In 1905, then, systematic investigations into the life history of the
eel were included in the Danish program. The researches we have
carried out since that date fall into two groups: (1) Investigations
at sea; and (2) investigations in the laboratory.
282 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

The aim of the former was to obtain a survey of the breeding
grounds of the eel, similar to that I had made of the breeding places
of the Gadoids in the Atlantic from Iceland to Spain,? and the start-
ing point in this case was the find, already mentioned, of a full-
grown eel larva west of the Faroes in 1904. We hoped by tracking
down the larve in ever younger stages to be able to chart the area
or areas where the eel first enters on its existence and at the same
time to determine the rate of growth of the larve and thereby the
age of the elvers which appear on the shores of Europe in the spring.

The second group of investigations was, in contrast to the first,
carried out on land in the laboratory. It consisted of a statistical

that only two species of fresh-water eels could be shown to exist in
the Atlantic area: A western, Anguélla rostrata, which is met with
in the West Indies and northward of there in America and South-
west Greenland, and an eastern Anguilla vulgaris, which is dis-
tributed throughout Northern and Western Europe, the Mediter-
ranean countries, and the islands of the Atlantic from Iceland to the
Canaries (figs. 6 and 15). The eels found in the Azores are also
Anguilla vulgaris, whereas the eels of Bermuda belong to Anguilla
rostrata. In externals the two species are hardly distinguishable
one from another, but certain numerical characters afford a means.
The number of vertebra in particular is a valuable character, An-
guilla vulgaris having on an average about seven and a half more
vertebre than the American eel (ca. 114.7 against ca. 107.2—ef.
fig. 1). If we take the trouble of counting the vertebre it will be
only a very few specimens per thousand which can not be referred
with certainty to the one or the other of the two species. This fact
has proved of great importance in the investigations at sea, since it
was found that the larve of the European and of the American eel
are mingled together in certain areas of the ocean.

In spite of the enormous area of the European eel, statistical in-
vestigations failed to demonstrate the existence of local races, as has
been done with so many other species of fishes. All the samples,
from Iceland to Madeira and from Cyprus to the Azores, yielded the
same average values for the characters under consideration.

As will be seen from the following, this is entirely in agreement
with the result of our work at sea.

The investigations made at sea fall naturally into two groups:
(1) those carried out from the State-owned steamship 7'hor, which
was equipped for marine research, during the years 1903-1910. These
investigations, the general purpose of which was to study the repro-
duction and breeding grounds of the principal food fishes, were made
in Danish waters, in the North Sea, and in the Norwegian Sea, in
the Atlantic off the West Coast of Europe from Iceland to Morocco,
and in the Mediterranean. (2) Investigations in the open Atlantic,
carried out in 1911-1921, but with a lengthy interruption occasioned
by the war. For these we were unable to use the Z’hor, her radius
of action being too small. They were made from numerous Danish
vessels on Transatlantic routes, with no equipment for marine re-
search, and no experts to assist with the work, but furnished only
with a net, and with instructions drawn up by myself. Though
naturally of a very casual nature, restricted as they were to the
course of the vessel in each particular case, these investigations have
nevertheless yielded important results, and hearty thanks are due
284 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

the Danish seamen who contributed thereto. On some few occasions
we were able to work more systematically and with the assistance of
our own staff, as for instance in 1913, with the schooner Margrethe
belonging to the Vendsyssel Packing Co., and in 1920 and 1921, with
the schooner Dana, owned by the East Asiatic Co. In both these
cases, despite the fact that the vessels had not the special equipment
of the Thor, important results were obtained, and the owners, who
generously placed them at our disposal for the work, have highly de-
served the thanks of science. In 1921 and 1922 further investiga-
tions were carried out from the new State-owned research steamer
Dana IT (plate 2). Figure 3
shows a selection of the Danish
stations, 1903-1922.

I will now give an account of
our investigations at sea, touch-
ing very lightly upon the earlier
ones, which are dealt with in
detail in the reports already
published.

Following on cruises made in
1903-1905 with the Zhor, I was
able to show (1906)* that full-
grown eel larve were found in
quantities in the Atlantic west
of Europe throughout the en-
tire range from the Faroes to
Brittany, west of the 1,000
meter line. They were, how-
ever, not found east of this line;

pov yer In June, 1905, the larve were
full grown, averaging 75 mm. in length (cf. fig. 2). They oc-
curred pelagically in the upper water-layers, and were all un-
metamorphosed. From these investigations I was able to conclude
that all the eels of Northern and Western Europe come from
the Atlantic, and that they come from the sea beyond the coastal
banks. It was thus evident that the eel—as also, by way, the
conger—occupies an exceptional position among food fishes, inas-
much as I had been able to show that the minute larve of most of
these species belonged to the coastal banks west of the shores of

Europe, and were not met with farther out. Closer study of the
great elver fisheries of Western Europe (Bristol Channel, west of
France and north of Spain) supported to a high degree the conclu-
sions I had formed as to the Atlantic origin of the eel, and I was able
to point out that both the Bristol Channel and the Bay of Biscay
served, practically speaking, as two enormous wing nets or funnels,

which, facing west, would be specially calculated to pick up the eel
fry coming from the Atlantic.

In 1906 we made two cruises with the Zor in the Atlantic, one in
the spring and another in the autumn. On both these cruises full-
grown larve were found in great numbers west of Europe, but in
spring and early summer none of them had entered upon meta-

20397T—25—_20
286 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

morphosis, whereas in August and September the majority were
undergoing the process. It appears, then, that there is a certain
periodicity in the occurrence of the larve; the full-grown larval
stages are met with in spring and early summer, metamorphosis
takes place in the autumn, and the elvers appear in winter and
spring. With the abundance of material at my disposal, I found
occasion to make a closer study of the metamorphosis, and was able,
by means of numerous measurements, to ascertain that the larve,
during the process of metamorphosis, are reduced in length about
1 cm., from about 75 mm. in June, 1905, to about 66 mm. in May,
1906, and in weight to less than a quarter of that before metamor-
phosis (pl. 3). The fully metamorphosed small ecls, averaging
about 614 cm. in length, which occur in Europe in early summer,
must, therefore, be presumed to be about a year older than the larve
found at the same time in the Atlantic west of Europe, which are on
an average about 714 cm. long.

Our investigations in 1906 to the west of France showed that the
larve occurred even over the greatest depths, over 5,000 meters; we
found, moreover, that they were always distributed in a particular
manner, the specimens which had not yet commenced metamorphosis
being taken farther from the coastal banks than the older ones, which
were undergoing the process. This led me to point out the prob-
ability that the breeding grounds of the eel were situated out in the
ocean far from the coasts (1909) ® a supposition which was to be
further supported in the very next year after it had been advanced,
by the appearance of new material of eel larve from the open Atlantic.

In a study published almost at the same time (1909)° on the “ Dis-
tribution of the Fresh-water Eels throughout the World,” I drew
attention to the fact that the distribution of the eels in the Atlantic
area distinctly coincides with the periphery of the great anticyclonic
circulation of the water masses in the North Atlantic.

The new material referred to—eel larvee from the open Atlantic
Ocean—was derived, partly from the cruise of the Norwegian steam-
ship M. Sars in the Atlantic, June-July, 1910, partly from some old
collections of Leptocephali which had lain for many years unex-
amined at the Zoological Museum in Copenhagen. Before proceeding
to this new material, I would call to mind that the eel larvae—nearly
800 in all—which I had taken on board the Z'hor in 1905 and 1906 from
the waters west of Europe, averaged about 714 cm. in length. The
largest measured 88 mm. and the smallest 60 mm. (see graph, fig. 2,

of any certainty to go upon.

A highly interesting and suggestive article on the eel larvee from
the cruise of the I. Sars, by J. Hjort, appeared in Nature, 1910
(“Eel Larve from the Central Atlantic” ).7 From this it appeared
that forty-four eel larve were taken during the cruise, twenty-three
to the west of Europe (north of 40° N., east of 30° W.), and twenty-
one south and west of the Azores. The former ranged from 61% to
8 cm. in length, and were thus of the same size as those I had taken
on board the Zhor. The rest, however, were considerably smaller,
viz, 4-6 em. long (one was 41 mm., three were close on 5 cm., and the
remainder between 5 and 6 cm.). The smaller larve were taken at
five stations situated between lat. 31° and 40° N. and between long.
30° and 48° W. According to Hjort’s interpretation, the twenty-one
smaller larvee represent the young of that year (the O group), the
larger ones those of the previous year (the I group). This being so,
the first-year larve should by June be 5-514 cm. long, and the full-
grown larve of about 714 cm. length should be about a year older.
Without venturing to assert anything definite on the basis of so small
a material, Hjort surmised that the breeding grounds of the eel
might be in the Central Atlantic, between the Azores and Bermuda.

The eel larvee which, as mentioned above, I found among some
old collections of Leptocephali in the Zoological Museum, Copen-
hagen, had been procured by the Danish Capt. A. Andrea, a zealous
collector of pelagic fauna, somewhere about 1865. There were only
three specimens, of which one, taken near Florida Strait, proved to
belong to the American species, the two others being larve ot
Anguilla vulgaris. The smaller of these measured 41 mm. and was
taken in the vicinity of Madeira (lat. 34° 20’ N., long. 18° 30’ W.) ;
the larger, 58 mm. in length, was found considerable farther west,
lat. about 30° N., long. about 32° W.

A comparison of these two stations with the five from the I. Sars,
did not make it easier to determine the origin of the larvae; rather,
indeed, the reverse. The two smallest extant specimens, both 41mm.
in length, were taken at long. 48° W. (Hjort) and long. 18° 30’ W.
(Andrea) respectively; that is to say, at a distance of about 1,500
miles one from another. If these two larve were in the first year,
and had not moved any great distance from the spot where they
came into the world, this would mean that the breeding grounds of
the eel embraced the entire eastern half of the Atlantic south of the
Azores. Or did they, on the other hand, indicate that there were
several distinct breeding-grounds, so that for instance the eels of the

7The same material was later dealt with by E. Lea, in “ Murenoid Larve from the
“Michael Sars” North Atlantic Deep-Sea Expedition, 1910” (Bergen, 1913).
288 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Azores had theirs in one place and those of Madeira in another?
If this were so, then where were the first-year larve of the enor-
mous hosts of eels from the Continent of Europe? For it must be
remembered that the Norwegian expedition with its effective fishing
apparatus had taken comparatively very few larve of the smaller
group, while Captain Andrea’s large collection of Leptocephali con-
tained but two specimens of the European eel. And, finally, there
was the natural question: how old were the smallest larvae,
with their length of just over 4cm. This question was obviously
of great importance, since if the larvee were some few months old,
they might have been carried great distances during that time by the
ocean currents, and in such cases it would be impossible to deter-
mine, for instance, whether the larve found south of the Azores
had originally come from somewhere farther to the east or some-
where farther west.

Considering these points, I perceived that if the problem were to
be solved in anything like a satisfactory manner it would be neces-
sary to ascertain, not only where the youngest larve were to be
found, but also where they were not. Until a comprehensive sur-
vey had been obtained as to the distribution and respective density
of the various sizes of larve in all parts of the sea, it would hardly
be possible to form definite conclusions as to the origin of the eels
of our European Continent. The task was thus one of enormous
dimensions, albeit with the consolation that the South Atlantic might
be disregarded as being devoid of any representative of the genus
Anguilla, a fact which I had been able to prove in my previously
mentioned work on the distribution of this genus throughout the
world (1909, loc. cit.).

In order to proceed further, then, it was evidently necessary to
procure observations from the greatest possible area of the North
Atlantic. As I have already stated, the Zhor was useless for such
work as this; I had, therefore, to endeavor to procure the requisite
material by other means. In pursuance of the project, application
was made from time to time to one and another of the Danish ship-
owning companies with vessels sailing regularly on trans-Atlantic
routes, requesting that the ships might occasionally be allowed to
draw a pelagic net for half an hour, and send in the resulting cap-
tures for investigation. Our request was on the whole very cour-
teously complied with, and during the years 1911-1915 hauls were
made at about 550 “stations” by 23 different vessels, steamers, and
sailing ships, of Danish nationality, one of them belonging to the
Danish royal navy. A chart of the stations* shows that they are

BREEDING PLACES OF THE EEL—SCHMIDT 289

well distributed throughout the North Atlantic area. I may state
at once, that the yield of larve of the Kuropean eel amounted in all
to 120. This represents about one larva for every fourth or fifth
station, a result which must be considered satisfactory in view of
the highly primitive equipment, the short hauls, and the fact that
a great number of the stations were in areas where eel larvee do not
occur.

During the first two years (1911-12) the collections of materia
made were chiefly from vessels sailing between the English Channel
and the West. Indies, but the yield was generally poor, three larva
from one station being the highest. An encouraging feature, how-
ever, was the finding of a larva only 34 mm. in length at 25° N., 51°
W., both from the fact that the previous minimum record (41 mm.)
was thereby beaten, and also because the locality of the find sug-
gested a place of origin even more to the south and west than we
had hitherto been warranted in imagining. The material, however,
was still too small and too sparsely distributed to give us the distinct
indication we desired; indeed it is hardly too much to say that with
each new observation a new problem arose, demanding a solution
of itself, without otherwise contributing to the elucidation of the
matter as a whole. Consequently, when, in 1912, I published my
last report of the investigations at sea® I was obliged to express my-
self with the greatest reserve on the question of the breeding
grounds of the eel, despite the fact that the finds of larve in the open
Atlantic Ocean had considerably increased in number as shown in
the chart, Plate VI, loc. cit., 1912. In a summary which appeared in
Nature for August 22, 1912, I summed up the position as follows:
“ We can not say as yet where exactly the spawning takes place,
and but little more than that the spawning places must lie in the
Atlantic beyond the continental slope, and that they must lie in the
northern Atlantic.” There was one point in particular which made
the matter difficult. As already mentioned the Af. Sars had in the
month of June found a score of larvee, 4 to 6 cm. in length, which
were classed by Hjort as belonging to that year (the O group), his
view being that they had come into the world the previous winter
and spring. Our investigations, however, repeatedly gave us larve
of the same size, but taken in winter and spring. Thus, for in-
stance, we had three specimens taken early in December not far
from the Azores (station 397), measuring 43, 48, and 56 mm.; other
samples taken in March and April contained specimens measuring
47, 49, 50, 57, and 59 mm. in length. It, therefore, seemed doubtful

Fresh-Water Eel (Anguilla vulgaris),” (‘‘ Internat. Revue der gesammten Hydrobiologie
und Hydrographie,’”’ Leipzig, 1912).
290 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

whether Hjort’s interpretation of his specimens taken in summer as
being first year larve could be correct, since if this were the case
one would have expected to find much smaller specimens in winter.
There was, however, the possibility that both Hjort’s summer speci-
mens and our winter specimens were in their first year, but if so,
it had to be presumed that a regular production of ova and larve
took place all the year round, so that not the season, but the locality,
i. e., the distance from the site of production, would be responsible
for the size of the larve. There were, however, several facts which
spoke against the theory of such uninterrupted production, as, for
instance, the periodicity in the occurrence and metamorphosis of the
larvee which I had discovered on board the 7hor in 1905-1906.

The net result, then, of our investigations by the close of 1912 was
that a great deal more research work would be needed, since the
new data obtained had practically raised new difficulties in the way
of an interpretation—as, indeed, often happens when an investiga-
tion has passed beyond the earliest stages, when the paucity of
facts gives freer play to the imagination.

The year 1913 was marked by important progress. Not only did
our fishing cargo vessels send us in richer material, but we suc-
ceeded in getting the little schooner A/argrethe, belonging to the
Vendsyssel Packing Co., of Copenhagen, equipped and sent out on
a cruising expedition over the Atlantic, with a supply of nets, etc.,
for pelagic work. The investigations were carried out during the
months of August-December along the following three lines: (1)
From the Faroes to southwest of the Azores (about 28° N., 40° W.);
(2) thence to the Newfoundland Banks; and (3) from there to the
West Indies. The yield was 714 larve of the European eel, besides
a small number (24) of the American. We had now at last obtained
a large amount of material from the open Atlantic Ocean, and the
study of this yielded important results. It was very significant, in
the first place, that the larvee increased in uumbers from east to west,
the greatest quantities being taken west of long. 50° W. In this
area the Margrethe succeeded in taking no less than 154 specimens
at one station (station 1040) with a net 2 m. in diameter at opening,
and one of the sailing vessels fishing for us, the schooner Agent
Petersen, took 24 specimens in one haul with a small net only 1 m.
in diameter (station 765). By way of comparison, it may be men-
tioned that our greatest number of larve per haul in the eastern
Atlantic, with the far more intensively working Zhor, was 70.

No less interesting was the size of the larve at the different sta-
tions. The following representative stations will serve to illustrate
this:

Fic. 4.—European eel (Anguilla vulgaris)

Sizes of larve at stations from North to South, western Atlantic between 50° and 60°
long. W.; Margrethe, October, 1913.

It will be seen from the above measurements that the sizes of the
larvee decrease from east to west and from north to south. A good
general idea may also be gained by marking off the Margrethe’s
hauls on a chart of the North Atlantic, and drawing a line from
Newfoundland in a southeasterly direction, toward Cape Verde. It
will then be seen that, west of this line, no larve over 5 cm. in
length were taken, whereas most of those taken east of this line were
5 em. or more, and none less than 4 cm.

_ It had now been shown, by systematic investigation across the
Atlantic Ocean, that the larve of the European eel increase in num-
292 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

ber, but decrease in size from east to west. This placed it beyond
doubt that the stock of eels in Europe must have its origin in an
area situated far to the west in the Atlantic Ocean.

The question now was, what further conclusions could be drawn
from the wealth of material obtained from the Margrethe’s 73
stations, comprising as it did, apart from larve of the fresh-water
eel, close on 10,000 larvee of other eel fishes.

In October and November, and the early part of December, 1913,
the Margrethe was working in the western part of the Atlantic, be-
tween Newfoundland and the West Indies, in the course of which
cruise the northern and southern limits of distribution of the larve
of the European eel were determined. They were found to occur
from about 40° N. latitude (a bare 200 miles south of the New-
foundland Banks), to about 24° N. latitude. To the westward speci-
mens were found as far as our investigations reached, viz, to Ber-
muda and the sea to the south of there, i.e., to about 65° W. longi-
tude, and even here they were present in great numbers. This was
an astonishing fact, for one would hardly have expected to find the
larvee of our European eel as a numerous population in Atlantic
waters so far west as 65°—New York lies about 74°! Larve of
the American eel were also taken in our nets, but in remarkably
small numbers, amounting to only some few (3-4) per cent of the
total number of Anguilla larve.t Here, again, a new problem
arose; for how could it be that Bermuda was, as it were, surrounded
by a belt of larvee of the European eel, when all the specimens of
fresh-water eels I had previously examined from these islands had
proved to belong to the American Anguilla rostrata? It was not
until several years after that we were to learn the explanation of the
mystery; the time was not yet ripe for its solution.

We now come to the size of the eel larvee taken on the cruise of the
Margrethe. The smallest eel larva hitherto known was, it will be
remembered, one measuring 34 mm. in length, but this was only
a single isolated find, and did not count for much. On the other
hand, it was to be expected that the great mass of material from
the MJargrethe, systematically collected as it was, would furnish
valuable data as to the size of eel larve in autumn. We were, of
course, still without any answer to the important question as to
whether larvee were produced uninterruptedly throughout the year,
or if a particular season of the year could be defined as the breed-
ing season of the eel. Not until these points were settled should
we have anything to go upon in judging the age of the older larve
from the central and eastern Atlantic.

2The larva of the American eel was described in 1902 by Eigenmann and Kennedy
from two specimens, 47 and 49 mm. in length, taken by the U. S. S. Albatross in 1883
at about 38°-39° N. lat., 72°-73° W. long. (Bull. U. S. Fish Commission, XXI, 1902).
I do not know of other records from the literature of the larve of the American eel.
BREEDING PLACES OF THE EEL—SCHMIDT 293

The graph, station 1040, Figure 4, gives a good idea of the size
of the larve in autumn in the western Atlantic. In the first
place, it will be seen that the smallest specimen was 17 mm. long
only—a marked lowering of the previous minimum record of
34 mm.—but, despite the intensive fishery, only a single specimen
of this small size was taken throughout the whole cruise, and only
a very few slightly larger, 2-3 cm., amounting to 1-2 per cent of the
total number. Furthermore, the graph shows that an overwhelm-
ing majority of the larvae were of sizes varying between 314 and
414 cm. in length. (As mentioned above, no specimen over 5 cm.
was taken by the Margrethe in the western area, west of the line
referred to on page 291.)

These facts, in my opinion, warranted the following conclusions:
The spawning of the eel can not go on regularly throughout the
whole year; there must, in autumn at any rate, be a cessation or de-
crease in the production, otherwise we must have found tiny larve
in greater numbers at this season. Even though the time when the
eels did spawn could not be determined with certainty, the size of the
larvee nevertheless rendered it likely that they had come into the
world during the first half of the year 1913. We were dealing, that
is to say, with larvee in their first year (the O group), and these
were as we have seen about 314 cm. long in the autumn.

Since tiny larve were, practically speaking, unrepresented in the
Margrethe’s collections, it was impossible at that season to determine
with any certainty the locality of the breeding grounds, since if the
larvee were even a few months old—which must seem probable—we
could not overlook the possibility of their having been carried by
ocean currents far from their place or origin. <A calculation of the
average length at the different stations, however, was not without
interest in this connection, the differences, although not great, being
nevertheless beyond doubt. The lowest average lengths, for instance,
were found at stations situated about latitude 26° N., longitude 55°
W.; from here the larve increased in size both toward the north and
toward the northwest (in the direction of Bermuda). To the south,
as mentioned, the larvee were entirely lacking.

This was, generally speaking, the result of the work of the Mar-
grethe on her cruise to the West Indies. It had been intended to
spend the winter in fisheries investigations at St. Thomas, and then,
following up the work of the outward voyage of the argrethe, to
continue the eel investigations during the voyage home in spring.
Fate, however, ordered otherwise; the Margrethe ran aground on
one of the West Indian islands and was wrecked.

_ The collections, fortunately, were saved, but here we were at St.
Thomas with no ship. The only thing to be done for the moment was
294 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

to endeavor to press forward, the work being done from the trading
vessels. We had now, of course, some definite facts to go upon. We
knew that the tiny larve were to be sought during the first half of
the year, and the record specimen of only 17 mm. length, already
frequently referred to, would also be a good guide. I was now able
to issue instructions far more precise in character than hitherto, both
as regards time and place, and also the depth, to be chosen for fish-
ing. Through the very generous cooperation of the East Asiatic Co.,
of Copenhagen, a considerable number of hauls were taken in the
spring and summer of 1914 by steamers of this line on the West
indies route, and these did not fail to produce their result. As early
as June, the steamship Samui and steamship Pintang brought us
plankton samples, taken in May and June about latitude 26° N.,
longitude 55° W., all of which were found to contain larve of the
Kuropean eel, for the most part tiny stages. At one of the stations,
for instance (station 789, 8/5, 1914) seven specimens of the following
lengths were taken: 9, 9, 11, 16, 16, 16, 21 mm., i. e., an average of
14 mm., and another (station 793, 11/6, 1914) yielded eleven speci-
mens averaging 18.1 mm. in length.

On returning from the West Indies we set about endeavoring to
get another schooner to work in place of the M/argrethe, but thea
came the great war, and all plans for further researches at sea had
to be laid aside. The work of the trading vessels, however, was
maintained during the first years of the war and continued to yield
valuable information. In 1915, for instance, we obtained confirma-
tion of the fact that tiny larve occur in summer, and a sample
taken at the end of September, 1915, contained eight specimens ot
about 314 em. long, i. e., of the same size as those taken by the A/ar-
grethe in the autumn of 1913. As the war increased in extent, how-
ever, our collecting work died out, and several of the vessels which
had been assisting us were sunk by submarines. During the next
five years, therefore, from 1915 to 1920, the investigations at sea were
altogether at a standstill; I was able, however, on the basis of mate-
rial from the western Atlantic, to work out a description of the
development of the larve of the two Anguilla species and a series
of other Atlantic murenoids (1916).1° The larve of the European
eel were now known in all stages of development, from that of 9 mm.
up to full-grown larve averaging 714 cm. in length, and in their
metamorphosic stages. I was also able to describe the development
and metamorphosis of the larve of the American eel, which proved
to be considerably smaller—1 cm. at least—than that of the Euro-
pean, in a fully grown state.

BREEDING PLACES OF THE EEL—SCHMIDT 295

The few metamorphosic stages of the American eel I had at my
disposal I had found in a collection of murzenoid larve from a cruise
of the United States ship Bache sent me by the United States Com-
missioner of Fisheries, Dr. Hugh M. Smith, of Washington. The
work of the Bache was carried out in January, February, and March,
1914, in connection with the program of the International Council
for the Study of the Sea, in the Gulf Stream area and along two
sections between Bermuda and the United States coast. The col-
lection consisted of several hundred murenoid larve, among which I
found 37 specimens belonging to the genus Anguélla, taken near Ber-
muda or in the waters between there and the United States. Closer
examination showed that only 6 of these 37 belonged to the Ameri-
can species, the remainder being larvee of Anguilla vulgaris, 4-5 cm.
in length. Thus the collections from the Bache furnished additional
evidence of the mysterious fact that, as we had shown in 1913, the
larve of the Kuropean eel may, even in the American waters of the
Atlantic, predominate greatly over those of the species of eel which
has its habitat in America. A remarkable feature of the case was
that at more than one of the Bache’s stations, as also of the Afar-
grethe’s, larve of both species were brought up in the same net at
the same time. I shall later, in dealing with the investigations
undertaken by the schooner Dana, return to this point, which I found
altogether incomprehensible at the time. ;

The collections of material from trading vessels had, in the five
years they covered, been of great assistance to us, first and foremost
by showing in what parts of the Atlantic eel larvee were to be found
and where they were lacking. We were, however, indebted to them
for more than this. During the last two years during which such
collections were made—1914 and 1915—the West Indies steamers
had regularly brought us in larve so small in size that we were able
with perfect certainty to conclude therefrom that the steamship
route from the English Channel to St. Thomas must pass through
the breeding grounds of the eel. This was indeed a point of the high-
est importance in the task we had before us: to chart the spawning
area of the cel. Ships bound to follow a certain particular route, how-
ever, could not, of course, assist us in ascertaining the boundaries of
such an area. Altogether, matters were now so far advanced that
we could hardly expect to gain any great further advantage from
occasional hauls by trading vessels. For the work now to be done
we needed a vessel specially equipped, which could be employed on
that work all the time, and follow any course laid down, as might
seem desirable from the results of expert examination of the material
on board from one station to another.

Our endeavors were accordingly directed toward this end as soon
as the war ceased, and it was possible once more to think of work
296 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

at sea. The plans met with great difficulties, but, on the other hand,
were strongly supported in various private quarters, both with
financial help and in other ways. Particularly effective was the
assistance here rendered by the East Asiatic Co., of Copenhagen,
which I have already had occasion to mention in a like connection,
and whose director, His Excellency H. N. Andersen, placed at our
disposal a vessel, fully ready for sea and actually at work, the four-
masted motor schooner Dana, of 550 tons, for the purpose of these
investigations.

With the schooner Dana and with the steamship Dana we have,
during the years 1920-1922 made hauls at a great number of sta-
tions. Most of the stations were situated in the western Atlantic.
A great quantity of material was obtained; this has not, however,
yet been dealt with in detail, especially the yield of 1921-1922.
The mureenoid eggs have not been identified as yet, and I have there-
fore been unable to take them into consideration. For the purpose
of mapping out the breeding grounds of the eel I have employed—
as previously when dealing with the Gadoids—the earliest larval
stages, less than 10 mm. in length. These are so tiny that there
can be no question of their having moved any considerable distance
from the spot where the eggs were spawned.

These tiny larve were found at a considerable number of stations.
On marking these off upon a chart (fig. 5), it will be seen that
the breeding grounds of the European eel form a continuous area
situated in the western Atlantic between about 22° and 30° N. lati-
tude and about 48° and 65° W. longitude. The central portion will
be found to lie about latitude 26° N., or approximately equidistant
from the Leeward Isles in the West Indies and from Bermuda.

It is on the 1920 investigations in particular that the chart is
based. As to how far the area may vary in extent from one year to
another I am unable to say. This much, however, is certain, that
tiny larvee, less than 10 mm. in length, have now been found within
this area in no fewer than five different years, viz, 1914, 1915, 1920,
1921, and 1922.

The position of the area will be seen from the charts, Figures 5
and 6, where it is indicated by the heavily drawn curves, which I
have termed the 10-mm. line, as marking the limits of occurrence of
larve less than 10 mm. in length. Similar lines have been drawn
for the 15, 25, and 45 mm. limits, taking all our finds of eel larvee
1904-1921 into consideration. I shall revert later on to these curves

11 Since it has been questioned whether the ripe eggs of the eel contain oil globules, I
may mention in this connection that the remnants of the yolk sac found in the earliest
larval stages prove to contain a large, quite distinct oil globule (see also fig. 13 show-
ing a prelarva). This observation confirms the conclusion arrived at by T. Wemyss
Fulton in 1897 from the study of the ovarian eggs of the eel.
BREEDING PLACES OF THE EEL—SCHMIDT 297

and the conclusions which they warrant in regard to the trans-
oceanic migrations of the larve. First of all, I propose to deal with
their occurrence on the breeding-grounds in the western Atlantic.
In the latter half of April, the average length is about 12 mm.;
in May, June, and July, it is increased, but in each of these months
specimens less than 10 mm. are found. From this we may conclude
that the spawning season of the eel commences in late winter or
early spring and lasts to well on in summer. In autumn and early

winter tiny larvee were not found, as mentioned when dealing with
the Margrethe’s investigations in 1913.

The Dana stations from June, 1920, within the breeding area
yielded large hauls, which gave us an extremely lucid picture of
the larve of that year (the O group) which in June averaged about
25 mm. in length. By way of example we may take a haul of two
hours’ duration at about 50 m. depth, station 871 (lat. 27° 15’ N.,
long. 61° 35’ W.) on June 27, 1920. The contents of the net when

As mentioned, the average length in June was about 25 mm., and
the great majority of larve of this size were found to occur near
the surface—from a depth of about 50 m. to the surface itself.
The younger larve (7-15 mm. long) were taken somewhat deeper,
at depths ranging from about 300 to about 75 m.; but it must be
borne in mind that the depth of the ocean here is over 6,000 m.
We may, therefore, assert that the larve of the eel, even at these
early stages of development, are true pelagic organisms, pertain-
ing to the upper water layers, as the 1905 investigations had shown
was the case with the full-grown larve.

A closer investigation of the sizes of the larve from the Dana
stations in the western Atlantic is of interest. The figures provide

Sizes of larve caught in a single haul of two hours’ duration at “ Dana” station 871

about 50 m. (same haul as that represented in fig. 10). The largest specimen shown
belongs to the I group, the remainder to the O group.

a far sounder basis for determining the age of the larve that we
had before. Figure 10 shows the sizes of the youngest year class
(the O group) in April, 1921, and Figure 8 the O group in June,
1920. The measurements from June are from specimens taken in
a single haul. If we include the entire material from the Dana
stations in June, 1920, we find that the O group varies from 7 to
37 mm., with an average length of about 25 mm. We have a very
large quantity of material from the month of June, between four
and five thousand specimens, so that the average length of the group
for this month is determined with a high degree of accuracy.

Now it has been noticed for several years, that in spring a few eel
larvee, between 40 and 50 mm. long, appear in or near the spawning
area in the western Atlantic. In June, 1920, also, some of these
larve—78 in all—were taken by the Dana, more especially in the
northern part of the area.

The measurements will be seen from Figure 8, showing one, and
Figure 10, showing three of these larve among the O group. The
graph, Figure 9, also indicates the lengths of the largest specimens of
the O groups, which, as mentioned, varied at this season from 7 to 37
mm. It will be noticed that the millimeter scale shows a distinct
interval between the O group and the group of individuals between
40 and 50 mm. In June it lies about 38-39 mm., being then but
slight; in the spring, on the other hand, when the O group is much
smaller, the interval between the two groups is, of course, far more
pronounced (see fig. 10). There can thus be no doubt that the group
of 40-50 mm. length represents the remainder of the previous year-
class (the I group); individuals which have not yet succeeded in
moving any considerable distance from the breeding-grounds. In
Figure 9 then, we have the uppermost portion of the O group and

length (fig. 4, p. 291).

We are now enlightened as to the sizes of the larve in the western
Atlantic at the different seasons. The larve found here, i. e., west
of long. 50° W., are almost without exception under 50 mm. in
length. They belong to the two youngest year-classes, the O group
being by far predominant in point of numbers. Its average length
in April is about 12 mm., in June about 25 mm., and in October 30-40
mm. During the second half of the year the bulk of the O group
move away from the breeding area, but a number of individuals—
the numbers varying from year to year—do not manage to get away,
and we find them, then, in the spring and early summer as the I
group, especially in the northern part of the area, about latitude 30°
N. In June, 1920, the average length of these was 43-44 mm.; in

302 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

other years they may be a little larger. They represent the last or
youngest portion of the I group, the great majority of which have
already moved away from the area.

From our investigations with the Zhor in 1905-1906, it will be
remembered that the full-grown larve occur in early summer out-
side the coastal banks to the west of Europe. They vary in length
from 60 to 88 mm.; in June, 1905, the average was about 75 mm.

ing 25 mm. in length, are still on or near the breeding grounds.
During the journey, then, from here to the shores of Europe, these
larvee grow on an average 50 mm. Plotting the lengths for the
- different months in a graph, we find that the larve take on an aver-
age two years to grow so much (fig. 11). The full-grown larve in
Figure 2 from June, 1905, thus represent the II group, and are, on
an average, two years older than the 25 mm. larve from the western
Atlantic shown in Figure 8 and on Plate 4.
BREEDING PLACES OF THE EEL

SCHMIDT 303

The intermediate year-class—the I group—is, judging by the avail-
able data, to be found during early summer in the central Atlantic,
between about 50° and 20° W. longitude, its average length being,
then, 50-55 mm. Our trading vessels caught them in May in quite
considerable numbers, and there can hardly be any doubt that it was
this I group to which the score of specimens taken by the JZ. Sars
expedition in June, 1910, to the south and west of the Azores, really
belonged (see p. 287). Later in summer I group larve have been
taken both by the Margrethe and the Pana in the neighborhood of
the Azores, and in February by the 7’hor near Gibraltar, the average
length here being about 66-67 mm.

The eels, then, spawn in spring, their larve take on an average
about two years to attain full larval size, and nearly three years
elapse before the metamorphosis is completed. The elvers, which
make their appearance on our shores in spring, will accordingly be,
on an average, about three years old.

The illustration, Plate 6, Figure 2, shows the same as the table
above.
3804 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Reverting now to the distribution of the various larval stages in
the Atlantic, let us glance once more at the charts (figs. 5-7). I may
supplement the indications there given by noting here our northern-
most, southernmost, westernmost, and easternmost finds of larvee
of the European eel:

Larve of the European eel (Anguilla vulgaris)

Northernmost find: Lat. 61° 21’ N., long. 10° 59’ W. (Thor).
Southernmost find: Lat. 20° 14’ N., long. 57° 03’ W. (SS. Tranquebar).
Westernmost find: Long. 73° 43’ W., lat. 35° 42’ N. (Dana JI).
Easternmost find: Long. 15° 35’ E., lat. 38° 07’ N. (Thor).

The result may be briefly expressed as follows: The larve were
found all across the Atlantic Ocean, coastal waters excepted, but
only north of the twentieth degree of latitude north. In the eastern-
most part of the Atlantic they extend northward beyond the sixtieth
degree of latitude. These facts will give an idea of the enormous
extent of the area in which larve of our European eel occur.

The starting point for the transoceanic migration of the larvee is the
area encircled by the heavily drawn line in the charts Figures 5 and 6.
If the annual production of eel larvae only occupied a very brief
period, say one month, and provided that all individuals came from
the same spot and made equal progress, alike in their growth and in
their movement eastward, then it would be an easy matter to indicate
the position of each particular stage of development in the ocean by
curves representing the average lengths of the specimens. As it is,
neither of these conditions is fulfilled, and it is difficult, therefore, to
draw up a clear and simple chart of the material. After various
experiments in this direction I have adopted the method of noting
on a large chart the minimum length of the specimens found at each
station, these values being then used in constructing the curves shown
in Figures 5 and 6. These curves are to be understood as limits of
occurrence, i. e., specimens less than 25 mm. have only been found
within the area embraced by the 25-mm. line, and so on.

The chart gives the main sum of the conclusions to be drawn from
the material collected in the course of years. The position of the
curves clearly shows that the principal resultant of the movement of
the eel larvee from the breeding grounds is directed toward north-
east; that is to say, toward Europe. It will be noticed that there is
also a certain movement toward the north and northwest. From the
data available it is not easy to determine in what direction the main
body of the larvee commence to move. From investigations with the
Dana, in 1920, it might seem as if the majority started with a north-
ward move and did not turn eastward until they had reached several
degrees farther north. On the other hand, our investigations of 1913
with the Margrethe seem to show that great numbers of larve can
BREEDING PLACES OF THE EEL—SCHMIDT 805

take a more direct northeasterly course from the breeding grounds.
The probability is that differences will be found to occur in this
respect as between one year and another and also as between differ-
ent parts of the breeding grounds.

Anyhow, the result of the movement is that no full-grown larvee
of the European eel are met with in the western Atlantic. As al-
ready mentioned, it was altogether exceptional to find specimens
over 50 mm. in length west of 50° W., and we have never taken a
single one over 60 mm. in this portion of the ocean (cf. fig. 7).

During the initial period of our investigations in the eastern At-
lantic and the Mediterranean we had no occasion to concern ourselves
with the American eel (Anguilla rostrata) and its larve. Later on,
however, circumstances changed, after it was found that our re-
searches in connection with the European species would have to be
extended farther west. The collections here made by the trading
vessels, and by the Margrethe in 1913, brought us already certain
specimens which, though outwardly indistinguishable from Lepto-
cephalus brevirostris, proved, on being tested for number of muscle
segments (myomeres), to belong to the American eel. These larve
were taken in the same area as those of the Kuropean species, even,
indeed, at one or two of the Margrethe’s stations, in the same haul.
It was with mingled feelings that we noted this fact, since it involved
a further complication of the eel question, which at this point seemed
more intricate than ever. Technically, also, it increased the diffi-
culty of our investigations, since the only means whereby the larve
of the two species can be distinguished one from the other is by
counting, under the microscope, the 104-120 myomeres in each in-
dividual specimen—a very lengthy and laborious business, especially
on board a small vessel at sea.

After the cruise of the Dana, in 1920, I look upon the matter in
quite a different way. True, the technical difficulties have not dimin-
ished—I have in mind the counting of myomeres in the thousands of
specimens obtained on the cruise—but the comparison of the life his-
tory of the two species which our investigations have enabled us to
make is, to my thinking, one of the most interesting chapters in the
history of the eel. Indeed, it is hardly too much to say that the life
history of the European eel can only be properly understood at all by
comparison with that of the American. This will be seen from what
now follows.

At the Dana station 827, southeast of Bermuda (80° 47’ N., 62°
27’ W.), we made a haul on June 13, 1920, at about 25 meters depth,
bringing up 150 Anguilla larve. These were measured, as usual, as
soon as possible after preservation, giving the result shown in Figure
-12, A. Believing that we had here solely to deal with Lepto-
cephalus brevirostris, we naturally regarded the haul as practically
306 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

representative of the youngest year class (the O group), and a few
specimens of greater length than the majority would simply be re-
garded as born somewhat earlier than the rest. On counting the
myomeres of the whole batch, however, which was done in the
course of the next few days, we arrived at an altogether different
result, and one which is of interest in more than one respect. It was
now found that out of the 150 specimens, 94 belonged to the Ameri-
can eel and 56 to the European eel. Figure 12, B and C, gives the
respective values separately shown. ‘They are now seen to have an
entirely different meaning. The specimens of both species are of the

current year class (the O group), but those of the American: eel are,
on an,average, larger than those of the European. From this we may
conclude that the former species must spawn earlier or grow more
rapidly than the latter. Furthermore, we notice that the two speci-
mens of the European eel of 43 and 45 mm. are so much larger than
the bulk of the specimens belonging to this species, that they must
be supposed to be leftovers from the previous year (the I group).
‘These conclusions were frequently confirmed as the cruise went on.

In all the collections the European eel predominates, even in the
western Atlantic. This is possibly the case also in reality. The
collections can hardly be taken as properly representative; in all
probability that of the Dana (1920-21) is nearest the true state of
things. In any case it is interesting to note that the Dana’s hauls
in the western parts of the ocean (west of 50° W.) yielded several
times as many larve of the European as of the American eel.
As far as can be determined from the incomplete statistics available,
the annual yield of the eel fisheries in Europe is several times that
in America (in America a little more than 2,000 tons, in Europe
more than 10,000 tons).

As in the case of the European eel, I note here the extreme limits
for our finds of the larve of the American species.

Larve of the American eel (Anguilla rostrata)

Northernmost find: Lat. 42° 19’ N., long. 50° 22’ W. (Margrethe).
Southernmost find: Lat. 17° 55’ N., long. 64° 48’ W. (Dana).
Westernmost find: Long. 82° 59’ W., lat. 20° 08’ N. (Dana IT).
Easternmost find: Long. 50° 22’ W., lat. 42° 19’ N. (Margrethe).

I would also refer to Figures 5 and 15, where the occurrence of the
larvee of the American eel is indicated by curves. The result may be
briefly stated as follows: We found the larve throughout the greater
part of the western Atlantic between the West Indies and the New-
foundland Banks, where they occur together with the larve of the
European eel. East of 50° longitude W. we have not met with larve
308 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of the American eel, which have thus a far more limited area of
occurrence than those of the European species just as we have found
to be the case with the larve of the American conger.

Most of the Dana stations in June-July, 1920, west of 50° W.,
gave larve of both species, but Anguélla vulgaris was, as a rule, the
more numerous. The larve of the two species were by no means
evenly distributed throughout the area; west of about 62° W. longi-
tude, and south of about 24° N. latitude, Anguilla rostrata predomi-
nated over Anguilla vulgaris, and in this part of the area we took

the two species, however, are apparently not separated, but seem to
overlap.

The early tiny larve, 7-8 mm. long, of Anguilla rostrata were
taken in February."* In April the average length was about 20-25
mm., in June about 30-35 mm., in July about 40 mm., and in Sep-
tember about 50-55 mm (cf. fig. 14). Toward the end of the year
the larve have attained their full length, about 60-65 mm.; meta-
morphosis takes place during the winter months, and in spring the
hosts of elvers move up into fresh water. We have examined samples
of pigmented elvers from St. Croix, West Indies (March), from the
Potomac at Washington (April), and from Little River, Mass.
(May). The average length in the two latter cases was about 57 mm.

From the data to hand, then, we may conclude that the American
eel spawns earlier, that its larvee grow more rapidly (cf. fig. 14), and
that the full-grown larva is smaller than is the case with the Euro-
pean species. A result of this is that Anguilla rostrata can complete
its full development from egg to elver in about one year, whereas An-
guilla vulgaris, as we have already seen, takes about three years. The
photograph, Plate 6, Figure 2, in comparison with Plate 6, Figure 3,
illustrates this, and shows that the I group of Anguilla rostrata in
June are already metamorphosed elvers, while this stage of develop-
ment is in the case of Anguilla vulgaris only attained by the III
group. Despite the fact that the two species are outwardly so alike
as to be hardly distinguishable, they differ to such an extent that the
one takes about three times as long as the other to pass through the
same cycle of development.

The recognition of this difference between Anguilla rostrata and
Anguilla vulgaris is of decisive importance to the comprehension of
the life history of the two species, and the fact provides a natural
explanation of several points that seemed mysterious before.

As already mentioned, an investigation of samples of eels from
Bermuda showed that they all belonged to the American species
(Anguilla rostrata). This in itself was not surprising. But in the
winter of 1913-14 both the Margrethe and Bache found the waters
round Bermuda populated chiefly by larve of the European eel. I
called attention to this point when dealing with the collections from
the two vessels (cf. p. 295), but was obliged to confess that it was

12JIt is not easy to distinguish the two Angwilla. species in their early larval stages,
when the hindmost myomeres can not yet be counted with certainty. On an average,
however, Anguilla vulgaris has a few preanal myomeres more than A. rostrata. In both
species there are a couple of black chromatophores on the embryonic tin near the tip of
the tail. As a rule, these are more pronounced and remain longer in A. rostrata than
in A. vulgaris. In the latter they are often difficult to discern and seem always to dis-
appear before the larva reaches a length of 20 mm.; in A. rostrata they are sometimes
discernible at a length of 30-35 mm. In several larve the gut contained food con-
. Sisting of minute organisms, presumably Coccolithophoride.

beyond my comprehension. Viewed in the light of our subsequent
investigations, however, the explanation is perfectly simple. The
larve of the European eel which are found at Bermuda and in the
western Atlantic generally are, owing to the vicinity of the breeding
grounds, all young, belonging to the O and I groups, and conse-
quently as yet far from that stage of development at which they
seek the shores. It is only larvee of the American eel which are found
so far west in the full-grown and metamorphosic stages, at which
they are drawn to the coasts. Consequently, Anguzlla rostrata is the
only one of the two species which “lands” at Bermuda, the hosts of
larve of Anguilla vulgaris which surround these islands being only
passers-by on their way to a far more distant goal.

As we have learned, the breeding grounds both of the European
and of the American eel lie west of longitude 50° W. Although the
larve of Anguzlla rostrata become far more numerous in proportion
from east to west, it is nevertheless a fact that there are extensive
areas where the larve of the two species are greatly intermingled.
The Dana stations provide many examples of such intermingling, as
shown in the photograph, Plate 5, and the graph, Figure 12.

It is very natural then to ask: If the larve of the two species are
found greatly intermingled in certain areas of the ocean, how is it
that the stock of eels in Europe is, practically speaking, pure, i. e.,
composed exclusively of Anguilla vulgaris and that in America of
Anguilla rostrata? ‘The question may also be formulated as follows:
How do the masses of larve in the western Atlantic sort themselves
out, so that those individuals which belong to Anguzlla vulgaris ulti-
mately find themselves in Europe, while those of Anguilla rostrata
“Jand ” on the shores of America and the West Indies?

In the main, the question is no longer difficult to answer. In the-
case of the American eel, the pelagic larval stage is terminated in
about one year; consequently the larve have not time to make the
journey to Europe, the distance being more than they can cover in
that period. It is otherwise with the European eel, which takes
nearly three times as long over its larval development, as a result of
which practically all of them are far away from the western (Amer-
ican) portion of the Atlantic when the time comes for them, as
elvers, to seek the coasts.

We can thus indicate both a geographical and an ethological cause
for the distribution of the two species of fresh-water eels. The for-
mer lies in the fact that Anguilla rostrata has its center of produc-
tion somewhat farther west and south than Angwilla vulgaris. 'The
latter is the different duration of the pelagic migratory stage. These
two facts, in conjunction with the ocean currents as an aid to trans-
port, and later—once the earliest stages of development are past—
the active movements of the larvee themselves. must be regarded as

Distribution of larve (dotted area) and of adults (black strip along the coasts where
the species occurs).

The curves show limits of occurrence; i, e., larve less than 15 mm. have only been
found inside the 15-mm. curve, etc.; the outermost curve denotes limit of occurrence of
unmetamorphosed larve (ul).

How does the distribution of the adult stages of Anguilla rostrata agree with the
distribution of the larve?

Many years ago (Johs. Schmidt, 1. c, 1909, p. 8) I tried to find a numerical
expression for the density of eels in the United States, dividing the States into three
regions: (1) Atlantic region (rivers draining into the Atlantic); (2) Gulf region (riv-
ers draining into the Gulf of Mexico) ; (3) Pacific region (rivers draining into the Pacific).

Setting the product of the eel fisheries in the States in connection with these subdivi-
sions of the region, we find that of the total product about 98 per cent comes from the
Atlantie region, especially the northern States (North Carolina and northwards) and
only about 2 per cent from the Gulf region (nothing from the Pacific) (cf. chart above).

This difference is so striking that we may conclude therefrom that there is a much
greater run of elvers in the Atlantic region than in the Gulf region. ‘

A glance at the chart above shows that the center of production for the larve of
Anguilla rostrata is situated north of the West Indies (inside the 15-mm. curve) and
that the larve during their increase in size spread out to the north and only to a smaller
extent to the south. On our cruises we found masses of larve north of the West Indies
and in the Gulf Stream region off Atlantic coasts of the States (cf. fig. 17), but com-
paratively very few south of the West Indies in the Caribbean Sea and in the Gulf of
Mexico.

There is thus an excellent agreement between the density of eels in the United States

and the results of our investigations regarding the breeding grounds of Anguwilla rostrata
and the direction of migration of its larve.

312 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

the causes which lead the two Atlantic species of eels to find each its
own side of the ocean, despite the close proximity of their breeding
grounds.

That fish should undertake migrations of considerable extent while
in the pelagic larval stage is nothing unusual. I need only call to
mind the young of the Gadoids and their migration round Iceland,
which I had an opportunity of studying in 1903-1905 (loc. cit., 1909).
The point which makes our eel an exception among fishes, and among
all other animals, is the enormous extent of its journeyings in the
larval stage. This is indeed a migratory stage par excellence, the
unusual duration of which must be regarded as an adaptation—
effected by selection—to the distances of many thousand miles to be
traversed. So great are these distances that the class of one year can
not reach its goal, the fresh waters of Europe, until a second and a
third have started on their way. As a matter of fact, we have in
early summer three year-classes of larve on their journey; the
youngest in the western, the next in the central, and the oldest in the
eastern waters of the Atlantic, off the coastal banks of Europe (cf.,
pl. 6, fig. 2, and fig. 7). There can be no doubt that a great wastage
of individuals takes place in the course of these years of migration,
but it is in all probability insignificant in view of the enormous pro-
duction of larve, of which the Dana stations in the western Atlantic

give evidence.

The Anguilla species, in contrast to other murznoids, are usually
termed fresh-water eels, and are reckoned among the fresh-water
fishes of Europe and North America. From what we have now
learned this is far from literally strict. Both from their history and
their actual manner of life, these “ fresh-water eels” are true oceanic
fishes, and the remarkable point in their life history is not so much
the fact of their migrating out into the sea to spawn as in their leay-
ing it in order to pass their period of growth in an environment so
unusual for murenoid fishes as fresh water.

I have in the foregoing pages described the course of our investi-
gations and set forth their results. In conclusion I will endeavor
very briefly to give an outline of the life history of our eel, as indi-
cated by the facts now ascertained.

During the autumn months the silvery eels leave the lakes and
rivers and move out into the sea. Once beyond fresh-water limits
the eels are, in most parts of Europe, outside our range of observa-
tion. Exceptions are, however, found, as in the case of the Danish
sounds and belts and adjacent waters, which are passed by great
quantities of eels on their way to the Atlantic, and form the site of
BREEDING PLACES OF THE EEL—SCHMIDT 813

important fisheries about October. In the western part of the Eng-
lish Channel trawlers may, toward the end of the year, occasionally
bring up a few big specimens in their nets, but after this the last
trace of the eel on European ground is lost. No longer subject to
pursuit by man, hosts of eels from the most distant corners of our
continent can now shape their course southwest across the ocean,
as their ancestors for unnumbered generations have done before
them. How long the journey lasts we can not say, but we know
now the destination sought: A certain area situate in the western .
Atlantic, northeast and north of the West Indies. Here lie the
breeding grounds of the eel (fig. 6).

Spawning commences in early spring, lasting to well on in sum-
mer. The tiny larve, 7-15 mm. long, float in water layers about
200-300 meters from the surface, in a temperature of about 20° C.
The larve grow rapidly during their first months, and in their
first summer average about 25 mm. in length (fig. 11). They now
move up into the uppermost water layers, the great majority being
found between 50 and 25 meters or at times even at the surface
itself. Then they commence their journey toward the shores of
Europe, aided by the eastward movement of the surface water
itself. During their first summer they are to be found in the west-
ern Atlantic (west of 50° long. W.). By their second summer they
have attained an average length of 50-60 mm., and the bulk are
now in the central Atlantic. By the third summer they have ar-
rived off the coastal banks of Europe and are now full grown,
averaging about 75 mm. in length, but still retaining the com-
pressed, leaf-shaped larval form. In the course of the autumn
and winter they undergo the retrograde metamorphosis which gives
them their shape as eels and brings them to the elver stage, in which
they move in to the shores and make their way up rivers and water-
courses everywhere (Plate 3). The average age of the elvers in
spring is about 3 years. Many individuals, especially males, keep
to the brackish water in lagoons or estuaries; others, especially fe-
males, move far up the streams they have entered and may in the
course of their wanderings penetrate far into the interior of the
Continent. In Switzerland, for instance, considerable quantities of
eels occur, and specimens have been taken there in waters at an
altitude of 3,000 feet above the level of the sea. The eels utilize
their sojourn in fresh water to feed and grow big, but the duration
of their stay here varies greatly, according to sex, climate, and
quantity of food, ranging from about five to about twenty years or
more. All the large eels are females; the males seldom exceed 45 em.
_ in length. During its period of growth the eel is of a yellowish
or greenish color, with no metallic luster; these growing eels are
generally termed “yellow eels.” When they have reached the stage
314 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

where the migratory instinct begins to assert itself the desire for
food, otherwise voracious, is lessened, the body takes on a metallic
sheen, and the pectorals become black and pointed. In this guise
the ells are termed “silver eels,” their flesh is very firm and rich in
fat, and they are thus well equipped for entering upon their second
and last great journey, this time back to the breeding grounds
across the ocean.

Before concluding this survey of the Danish eel investigations it
is my pleasurable duty to thank all those who have contributed to
the progress of the same. I have already mentioned how decisively
important was the aid afforded us from outside. Special thanks
are here due to Admiral H. R. H. Prince Valdemar, of Denmark,
and to His Excellency H. N. Andersen, director of the East Asiatic
Co., of Copenhagen. But in our Commission for Investigation of
the Sea also, much, and most valuable work has been done to further
these investigations first and foremost by the chairman, Commodore
C. F. Drechsel, Danish R. N.

Last, but not least, I thank my assistants who helped to carry
out the actual work at sea and on land. These, during the first
years, A. Strubberg, M.Sc., later P. Jespersen, M.Sc., and A. V.
Taning, M.Sc., have each taken a great share of the work with
much skill and enthusiasm. Further, the captain of our research
vessel, Capt. G. Hansen, has, in addition to the other duties fall-
ing to his share, on more than one occasion carried out work on
board which called for training in marine biological research.

POSTSCRIPT

Do the Indo-Pacific fresh-water eels breed in the sea like those of
the Atlantic, and do they, like these, undergo a larval development
with metamorphosis?

The present work has up to now considered only the two Atlantic
species, the European and the American eel.

There are, however, in the Indo-Pacific region also fresh-water
eels of the genus Anguilla, and, moreover, many more species than
in the Atlantic area.

What is the life history of the Indo-Pacific eels?

Do these eels breed in the sea, like the two Atlantic forms; have
they similar larval stages; and do they, like those of the Atlantic,
undergo a retrograde metamorphosis from larva to elver?

Nothing is known as to this. And even if we had larve which
might be supposed to belong to one of the Indo-Pacific Anguilla
species, they could not be identified from what is generally known,
as the information afforded by extant literature as to classification of
the Indo-Pacific eels is insufficient. The limits of the different
BREEDING PLACES OF THE EEL—SCHMIDT 815

species can not be defined, either zoologically or geographically,
without further characters than hitherto employed in classification.

It was therefore necessary to take up the whole question anew.

I have for several years been working on the classification of the
Indo-Pacific fresh-water eels, but have only lately been able to give
it full attention.

Thanks to the courtesy of the various authorities, I have been able,
with my assistants, especially Mr. Vilh. Ege, M. Sc., to examine
the material of Indo-Pacific Anguilla specimens of most of the lead-
ing museums, and get X-ray photos of most of the existing type
specimens. I have also received large collections from correspond-
ents in various parts of the world.

In all specimens, the number of vertebree was determined, and
other numerical characters investigated; several species have al-
ready been treated statistically, as previously with the Atlantic and
Japanese.

The investigation shows that the previous classification is inade-
quate. Take for instance, the Anguilla australis, originally de-
scribed by Sir John Richardson. This species, as understood by
the most recent writers on Indo-Pacific eels, ranges from Fast
Africa to Tahiti, and. from the Philippines to Auckland Island.
Geographically, this looks improbable, and on applying numerical
characters we find that “Anguzlla australis” consists of at least three
well-defined species, each with its own geographical area.

The introduction of numerical characters, however (number of
vertebree, fin-rays, etc.), is of importance not only for classification
of old, adult eels. We have thereby procured the means, hitherto
lacking, of identifying the early stages of the Indo-Pacific fresh-
water eels.

The method has already borne fruit, in that I am able here to
describe and identify the first larva of an Indo-Pacific Anguilla
species, and thus answer the question at the head of this postscript.
I am the more pleased to be able to do so here, since the material
was procured by an American expedition.

Some years back, I received from the Bureau of Fisheries at
Washington a large collection of Leptocephali for investigation.
It was collected by the U. S. S. Albatross on its Philippine expedi-
tion (1907-1910) under Dr. Hugh M. Smith.

This collection proved to contain two specimens of a Leptocephalus
outwardly altogether identical with the larve of the two Atlantic
Anguilla species. They were taken near the surface over consider-

able depths off Celebes, one near Menado on the north coast, the
other in the large Tomini Bay on the east coast. The lengths were
53 and 55 mm. Both specimens were preserved in formol and well
enough for sufficiently accurate determination of the numerical char-
acters. Reserving detailed description for a later occasion, I will
here refer to Figures 1 and 2, plate 7, and give the following data,
determined by Mr. A. V. Taning, M Sc.

The specimen of 53 mm. is a fully developed larva, metamorphosis
not yet begun, larval dentition intact, 16-17 teeth in each half of
jaw behind the large grasping teeth; in other words, about the
same number as in A. vulgaris and rostrata. It has 106 (69+37)
myomeres, answering to 105 vertebra, 285 dorsal, 218 anal, and 10
(5+5) caudal rays.

The other specimen, 55 mm. (more correctly 55.5 mm.) has begun
metamorphosis and lost the larval teeth. Number of myomeres
about the same as in the first larva, about 106; like the Atlantic
species at the same stage, it has some black stellate chromatophores
at tip of tail.

The numerical values of the larve enable us to identify them, at
least the first specimen, with sufficient certainty as belonging to the
species Anguilla mauritiana Bennett, a widely distributed tropical
species, common in the Dutch East Indies. These values agree com-
pletely with those we have found in Anguilla mauritiana, and pre-
clude other species, especially the two common in this area—Anguilla
australis Autt. and Anguilla celebesensis Kaup. The advanced posi-
tion of the dorsal fin in our larva (fig. 1, plate 7) also shows that it
belongs to Anguilla mauritiana.

The identification of the larvee from Celebes reveals several inter-
esting points which I will briefly note here.

1) We have learned that the larve of Indo-Pacific fresh-water
eels entirely resemble those of the Atlantic species. This is a fur-
ther proof of the extremely close relationship between all Anguilla
species, for Anguilla mauritiana is probably one of the forms most
widely removed from ours.

2) The length of the Anguilla mauritiana larva is about 514 cm.
This agrees well with the average length of five elvers of this species
from the Dutch East Indies (Zool. Mus. Amsterdam), about 5 cm.

3) The identification of the larva of Anguilla mauritiana is an
incontestable proof that the Indo-Pacific Anguzlla species, like the
Atlantic, breed in the sea and undergo a larval development with
metamorphosis. Other facts which I have brought to ight show
that the Indo-Pacific fresh-water eels, like those of the Atlantic,
require deep water to breed. I will deal with this point in a sub-
sequent paper.

Language is replete with terms that liken qualities of human
nature with the traits of animals, and fable writers of all times have
found an inexhaustible source of material for their stories in the
parallelisms between men and beasts. The insects, too, have served
in caricature as types of human character, though less accurately,
since they are less understood; for even amongst them there are the
bold and the timid, the haughty and the meek, the nervous and the
phlegmatic, the obstreperous and the patient; there are those that
labor incessantly and those that accept conditions as they find them;
there are the ptignacious, always looking for trouble, and those that
live by avoiding it; there are the rapacious that seek the destruction
of others, and the peace-loving, who fight in defense only.

Distinctions of this kind amongst animals, as amongst people, are
matters of temperament, but there is this difference between the two
cases in that, with people, temperamental traits are characteristic
of individuals, while, with animals, the differences are largely charac-
teristic of the species. Yet there are minor differences between
individual animals, and people also show strongly marked racial
traits of temperament which persist and intensify where races do not
commingle.

At first thought we might not believe that the temperaments of
animals, and especially of insects, could have any relation to our
own other than an accidental resemblance. On second thought,
however, it seems entirely possible that all such manifestations may
be identical in the sense that they may be but outcroppings of a
common property inherent in living matter itself. Temperament is
merely the reaction of the individual to external conditions, and
with people who exercise no control over these reactions, tempera-
mental exhibitions may be just as spontaneous and irresponsible as
with insects. In many cases amongst animals a specific tempera-
ment is beneficial or is a necessary accompaniment of a special mode
of life. A predatory creature must be alert, quick of movement,
.and aggressive; a vegetarian may be slow and placid, with a de-
203897—25——22 317
318 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

fensive but not an offensive nature; an animal that lives in conceal-
ment may be sluggish and lacking in all kinds of positive personality.

It is always a matter of wonder to me to see enthusiasts of sport
standing in line for hours and hours in order to get desirable seats
at some athletic contest, or lovers of the spectacular waiting on the
curb of the sidewalk from early in the day to be sure of a place in
the front line of spectators when a procession is to go by. I realize,
however, that their temperaments are different from mine, not in
that they enjoy the sport or the spectacle more than I do, but in that
they are able to stand there so long waiting to see it. The secret is
that standing and doing nothing does not distress them; they are
still normal at the end of it, because it is normal for them to be that
way. So when we see animals, especially insects, doing what would
be torture to our patience we have only to realize that their tempera-
ments are different, and that the
thing does not distress them, be-
cause it is normal for them to go
through with it.

In early spring those insects
that must always be in time for
the first course in nature’s seasonal
banquet begin to arrive at the
feeding grounds. Nature, how-
ever, assumes no responsibility of
calendar dates; the guests may be
present, but if bad weather takes
Fic. 1—A female spring cankerworm precedence, the food will not be

cals pote ae SORE it EP served till warmer temperatures

prevail. The guests must wait
with empty stomachs. As above intimated, though, “ patience” is
a term not to be applied to insects literally, since it implies volun-
tary submission to irksome necessity. With insects, passive en-
durance is a physiological state, a matter of constitutional
temperament. But is it not so with patient people, is not their
placidity due to constitutional physiological conditions that allow
them to be so? A person undergoing an operation under an
anesthetic is a “ patient” only in the technical terms of the hospital;
an insect quietly submitting to adverse conditions of its environment
is submissive because it lacks a stimulus to be otherwise, it is under
a physiological anesthetic.

Among the earliest of the spring arrivals in the Northern
States and in Canada are curious little insects that come out of
the ground, sometimes during warm spells in January and Febru-
ary, but mostly during March and April. They are to be found

CANKERWORMS—SNODGRASS 319

particularly in old neglected apple orchards where insects have
been allowed to lead their lives unchecked, and in elms along city
streets and in parks and woodlands. They are most easily dis-
covered sitting on the trunks of the trees, where eventually they
make their way after leaving the earth. Here they often remain
at one spot all day or for several days, especially if the weather
should turn bleak and raw, as it is likely to do during March and
Aptil, especially in the more northern latitudes, somtimes with
cold rains, and freezing temperatures at night, and sometimes
with snow yet on the ground.

A gray spot against the bark of the tree trunk, on closer inspection,
proves to be a living thing with an oval, furry body about half
an inch long, six long sprawling legs, a pair of slim antenne, and
two large black eyes (fig. 1). It curi-
ously suggests a moth with the wings
cut off, and, indeed, no better simile is
needed, since the creature is a moth :
with its wings so reduced by nature #
that but stubs of them remain (fig. 2).
Entomologists know this insect as the
female moth of the spring cankerworm
(Paleacrita vernata) .

An insect that comes out at such an
unseasonable time of the year can not
expect to find anything to eat; and, in
fact, the cankerworm moth has no such
expectations, her business is of quite a
different nature. She comes bearing a
load of eggs which are to produce her "6, 2- "Female, mots of ttude
offspring, and she must deposit these above, in resting position below
eggs on the tree sufficiently in advance Sea?
of the time when the leaf buds will open to allow the young to
develop and be ready to hatch when their food is ready, be-
cause the offspring of this moth will be a brood of hungry, leaf-
feeding caterpillars. The mother moth, therefore, has no concern for
herself; for the sake of her progeny she endures all the hardships
of weather that may come at this season, low temperatures, chilling
winds, soaking rains, perhaps snow. Few other insects could endure
unprotected what the cankerworm moth habitually encounters, which
again demonstrates the physiological differences that may exist be-
tween closely related creatures, and which cause them to react very
differently to the same external conditions.

The oval body of the cankerworm moth is little more than a bag of
- eggs. In the forward parts there are the muscles necessary for

320 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

moving the legs and for enabling these members to drag the heavily
loaded body over the ground and up the tree, and of course there are
breathing tubes, nerves, and a heart, all of which organs are neces-
sary for existence. But the alimentary canal is reduced to a mere
thread, and the external organs for taking food are so rudimentary as
to be entirely useless, the material necessary for maintaining the life
of the moth and for maturing the eggs having been stored in the
body of the insect during her own caterpillar days.

The exterior of the body of the moth appears to be covered with a
thick coat of fur, but, as with all moths, the material is really a
close growth of slender scales, which, however, are but modified hairs.
On the back of each of the seven exposed segments of the abdomen
there are two crosswise rows of recumbent spines directed backward.
From the rear end of the body the
spring cankerworm moth can protrude
a long tapering tube made of the ter-
minal body segments, which are ordi-
narily retracted one into the other like
the sections of a telescope. The eggs
are extruded from the end of the tube
when the tube is extended.

For a long period, sometimes for
several days, the female moth sits on

i | i the trunk or on a lower limb of the

a RAN iy ing why, but events suggest that she

he has not lost his insect heritage, though he too lacks organs for
taking food. After a brief time of courtship and mating the male
departs, and the deserted female is left to finish her life in solitude
as she began it. But now, in addition to her eggs, she carries
the fertilizing element of the male, without which the eggs would be
useless. The female soon resumes her journey upward and outward
on the branches of the tree, searching for suitable places at which
to deposit her eggs.

When the egg-laying tube of the female is fully extruded it is
about as long as half the rest of the body. With its tip the moth
probes into crevices or beneath pieces of loose bark, and when an ap-
propriate place is located she deposits there a group of eggs (fig. 4).
Moths that were taken into a room for observation during egg laying
curved the egg tube forward beneath the body and ejected the eggs
forward and downward from its tip; and the position of the eggs in
CANKERWORMS—SNODGRASS 321

most clusters found on the trees indicates that they must have been
placed in this same manner. Others, however, are deposited so far
under a ledge of bark that the moth must have entered the cavity in
order to have reached its innermost recesses with her egg tube. Her
habit of probing forward suggests that in such cases she backs over
the edge of the piece of loose bark and enters the cavity upside down.
The purpose of the spines on her back is not evident. Though they
may protect her body in
tight places, it would
seem that they would
also impede her en-
trance into crevices.
The spines are present
likewise on the same
segments in the male,
but are somewhat weak-
er than in the female.
The eggs of the
spring cankerworm (fig.
5) are to be found on
the trunk, on the limbs,
and on the twigs of the trees. Usually they occur in groups of
30 to 60, though as many as 150 have been recorded in one mass,
and often there are but three or four together. Dr. S. J. Hunter,
writing of the spring cankerworm in Kansas, says that a dissection
of 12 moths gave an average of 401 eggs in each, an exceptional in-
dividual containing 676 eggs. A count of the actual number of eggs
laid, however, he says gave an average of only 81 for each moth,
but these records were made from moths
of a brood below normal vitality. The
eggs of the spring cankerworm are oval
in shape, rounded at one end, slightly
pointed at the other, and are about one
ia thirty-sixth of an inch in length. The

some groups are brownish, others are

The eggs le in jumbled masses, all stuck to the bark or to one an-

When the moth has deposited her eggs her brief life’s work is
over. She falls back to the earth and there lies until her vital forces
are dissipated. Yet the eggs within her egg tubes previous to lay-
ing had no connection with her body; being freed from their weight,
it would seem, should be a relief to her and not an exhaustion. Here

again, by some unknown physiological regulation, life soon ceases
after its purposes are accomplished.

Early in May, usually about the time the buds on the apple trees
are opening and sending out the new leaves, the cankerworm eggs
hatch and send out a destroying army of young caterpillars. Ac-
cording to Doctor Hunter, the time of hatching depends on the tem-
perature. Eggs kept in the laboratory with a temperature of 72°,
he says, will hatch in 10 days; eggs under outdoor conditions with a
mean temperature of 48° hatch in 30 days. Each caterpillar,
or cankerworm, leaves the egg through a round hole in the blunt
end, and, as it emerges, assumes a length of about one-eighteenth of
an inch, fully twice that of the egg from which it comes cut. The
empty shell remains as a delicate, transparent capsule glistening
with its iridescent colors. The young caterpillars are snaky-looking
little things, despite their large heads and flaring hind legs (fig. 6) ;
but their curious manner of walking by humping up the back as
the rear end of the body is brought
forward, and then straightening
out again to repeat the humping,
at once catches the eye, and we
recognize in the tiny creatures
familiar acquaintances—measuring
worms !

Some of the young worms are
blackish, others are brown or green,
lig. 6.—Newly hatched spring canker- hyt most of them are marked by

a narrow yellow stripe along each
side of the body. Their special feature, however, which gives them
the snaky look just mentioned, is the lack of most of those legs
on the abdominal segments that are ordinarily characteristic of
caterpillars. The form and structure of a typical caterpillar was de-
scribed in the Smithsonian Report for 1922 (p. 353, fig. 17, A),
where it was shown that the caterpillar body consists of 13 seg-
ments, the first 8, or thoracic segments, carrying each a pair
of jointed legs, while of the remaining 10 or abdominal segments,
the third to the sixth, inclusive, and the tenth have each a pair of
soft, thick, unjointed “ prolegs.” The spring cankerworms have pro-
legs only on the sixth and tenth segments. Hence their lcoping
method of walking.

The full-grown spring cankerworms (fig. 7) are from three-
fourths of an inch to a full inch in length. In general they are of
a dark color, but they vary from pale olive brown or yellowish to
mottled brown and black, with one, two, or three broken yellowish
lines more or less distinct along the sides. On the back of the eighth

CANKERWORMS—SNODGRASS 323

abdominal segment there is a pair of small tubercles. There are
always only two pairs of abdominal prolegs as described above.

In observing cankerworms on an apple tree or in collecting speci-
mens, however, it will most likely be noticed that they are not all
alike. Some have the characters of those just described, while others
are marked often by several distinct lines along the sides of the
body, but are definitely sepa-
rable as different by the
presence of an extra though
a small pair of prolegs on
the fifth segment of the ab-
domen, which is the segment
next in front of that bearing
the first pair of fully-
developed prolegs. Cater-

belong to a distinct species cept those on sixth and tenth abdominal seg-
known as the fall canker- m™ents (x 2%)
worm (Alsophila pometaria) because the moths that produce them
appear mostly in late fall and deposit their eggs on the trees at this
season. The eggs of both species hatch at the same time in the
spring.

The fall cankerworms are in general of a greener color than the
spring cankerworms, but different individuals vary from light green
to dark olive brown. Most of them have three distinct pale stripes
along each side of the body, and an
occasional one has a large blackish spot
on each side of each segment between
the lower two lines.

For a month the caterpillars of the
two species of cankerworms feed to-
gether in the trees, where to the casual
observer they all look alike, both kinds
having the same general appearance and
size and the same looping gait. They
pe rei rage a ae orm both, also, when at rest have the queer

prolegs on fifth abdominal sesmene Dabit of grasping a twig or leaf firmly

with the abdominal feet and holding
the body stiffly in the air, projected at an angle from the sup-
port. They pose motionless in this attitude indefinitely and appear
to be impersonating a dead twig in order to fool their enemies.
They may sometimes elude the searching eye of an entomologist
or of a bird, but still the habit can not be of any great benefit
to the cankerworm species, since a bird could always find plenty of
active individuals feeding unconcerned. The trait, however, is one

324 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

common to many other measuring worms and in its origin perhaps
was beneficial. A habit more clearly protective is that which the
caterpillars possess of letting themselves drop suddenly at the ends
of threads from their spinnerets when a branch on which they are
feeding is lightly jarred, and of hanging suspended in midair. After

Fic, 9.—Spring cankerworms in various attitudes on twigs of apple trees

a time, when no danger seems to threaten, they ascend their threads
and resume feeding.

The cankerworms feed on several species of trees, but their favorite
kinds are apple and elm. Wherever the worms have fed on apple
leaves the scars become bordered by reddish brown areas, which,
spreading over the uneaten parts, give the leaves the scorched appear-
CANKERWORMS—SNODGRASS 325

ance characteristic of cankerworm injury. The very young worms
make mere pits or punctures in the leaves, but the older ones devour
great holes in them, finally reducing them to ragged skeletons or
bare stems (fig. 10). The damage done to apple trees may be very
considerable in cases of bad infestation, if remedies are not applied,
but the orchardist can control the pest by thorough spraying with
arsenate of lead, which, however, to be most effective should be done
when the worms are young. In orchards that are known to be in-
fested with cankerworms, the trunks of the trees may be banded in
late fall and early spring with sticky substances or with cotton bat-
ting, in order to prevent the female moths from ascending them.

Wie, 10.—Apple leaves destroyed by cankerworms

So similar are the two species of cankerworms, both in the larval
and in the adult stages, that even entomologists did not distinguish
between them for nearly two hundred years after they were first
called cankerworms. The name “cankerworm,” however, did not
originally belong to either of the two species of caterpillars to which
we now apply it in America. At the time the English translation
of the Bible was made, the word “canker” referred to most any de-
structive caterpillar.

Besides the cankerworms there are numerous other species of
measuring worms, or spanworms, as they are also called, most of
them having the same general appearance as the cankerworms.
Some are well-known pests on cultivated trees and shrubs, and others
are met with only occasionally, looping along in solitude or project-
ing motionless from a twig or the edge of a leaf. The majority of
326 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

them belong to a family of moths known as the Geometride, so
named from the measuring habits of their caterpillars. The reduc-
tion of the abdominal legs of the caterpillars is an accompaniment
of the looping style of progression, but does not occur to the same
degree in all species. In one group of the family the caterpillars
retain the full number of prolegs, which is five pairs, but the first
three pairs are reduced in size (fig. 11), the first pair being very
small, the others successively larger to the fourth pair, which is of
ordinary proportions. These caterpillars probably represent an

Fig. 11.—A geometrid caterpillar (Brephos infans) having the full number of abdominal
prolegs, but with the first three pairs reduced in size (X24)

early stage in the evolution toward suppression of the first three
pairs of abdominal legs. The fall cankerworm, with a rudimentary
third pair of prolegs (fig. 8), is in a stage near the other end of the
series, while the spring cankerworm (fig. 7) and others that retain
only two pairs represent what appears to be the degree of leglessness
most practical for the looping gait. AIl measuring worms, however,
do not belong to the Geometride, the familiar cabbage looper being
a member of quite a different family, the Noctuide.

When the cankerworms are full grown, about the 1st of June, they
cease their feeding and let themselves drop from the trees at the ends
of threads run out from their spinnerets. On reaching the ground
they burrow into the earth and bury
themselves at a depth of from 2 to 5
inches beneath the surface. Here the
spring cankerworms, after from four
days to a week, change to pupe (fig. 12).
The fall cankerworms, however, after

Vic. 12. Pupa of spring can-
kerworm in the ground their burial is accomplished, inelose

(X 2%) &
themselves in small oval cases or cocoons

made of earth particles firmly bound together with threads of silk,
and then rest in the cocoons for about 30 days before changing to
pups. The pupe of the spring cankerworms remain in the ground
through the summer, fall, and winter, transforming early the follow-
ing spring into the moths which come out at this season and whose
history has been given. Most of the pupe of the fall cankerworm
undergo their final transformation late in the fall of the year of
their interment.

The nature of the pupa of a caterpillar and its metamorphosis
to the moth was described in connection with the tent caterpillar
in the Smithsonian Report for 1922 (p. 253, fig. 17.) It was
CANKERWORMS—SNODGRASS 327

noted there that the reduction of the jaws, which organs are large
and strong in the caterpillar and rudimentary in the moth, takes
place by two steps, the first in the change from the caterpillar to
the pupa, the second in that from the pupa to the moth. The wings
of the female cankerworm moth »undergo likewise their final reduc-
tion during the change from the pupa to the moth, but since the
caterpillar is wingless, the wings appear first on the pupa, where
they form fairly large pads as in the pup of moths that are to
have fully developed wings. We might ask why wings are formed
at all when they are only to be reduced again. The answer is that
the maternal ancestors of the modern cankerworms were fully winged,
and that the pupa in acquiring wings is but repeating the evolution
of the species.

The tendency to
wing reduction in the
female moths of the
Geometridae, like the
tendency to leg reduc-
tion in the caterpil-
lars, appears to be a
physiological procliv-
ity of the family; it
crops out in various
degrees of expression Fic. 13.—Female Geometrid moths with wings in differ-

females are fully

(fig. 18, B) has wings of about half the normal size, appendages
probably useless, but showing that the moth has reached a halfway
stage in the evolution toward winglessness. In another species,
known as Bruce’s measuring worm, the female (fig. 13, A) resem-
bles the females of the cankerworms but has wing rudiments a little
longer. It is difficult to imagine just what such innate tendencies
within a group of animals may be in terms of physiology, yet many
other examples of the same thing might be given among insects
and other animals, just as we note among ourselves family traits
and family tendencies with regard to physical as well as tempera-
mental characters. But again, wing reduction in moths, like leg re-
duction in caterpillars, is not limited to the Geometridx, the female
of the common tussock moth being as nearly wingless as the female
canker moths.

Summer passes, fall comes, the first of November arrives. The
place is southern Connecticut. ‘The days are again cold and bleak.
328 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

The advance winds of winter come surging over the hills in the west ;
drenching rains soak the chilling earth and make sodden masses of
summer’s refuse that covers it. Now is the season when most of the
insects that will survive till spring are stowed away in their cocoons
or have found protection in some retreat where they will await the
return of warmer weather.

Yet, seeming to defy the laws of the insect world that impose
torpidity on other six-legged creatures and keep them in hiberna-
tion through the winter, the moths of the fall cankerworms now
break through their cocoons and emerge from the earth. Some law
of their own impels these creatures to undergo their transformation
and to deposit their eggs at this inclement season—eggs which are
not to hatch until the following spring. Any such striking example
of exceptions to general rules shows
clearly that the nature of the reaction
by living things to external stimuli de-
pends on the inner nature of the creature
itself; the potency for individuality of
physical temperament in living matter
again asserts itself.

The female moths of the fall canker-
worms (fig. 14) are very similar to those
of the spring species in size and general
appearance, though they are usually of
a more uniform lght brown color.
They may be easily distinguished from
the spring canker moths, however, by
the lack of spines on the abdominal seg-
ments, and by the short length of the
Fic. 14.—Female moth of the fall terminal hidden segments, which do not

From the places where they leave the earth, the wingless moths
crawl through the grass and over the dead leaves that cover the
ground until they arrive at the trunk of a tree. In cases of unusual
abundance of cankerworms the moths may be observed in large
numbers as they issue from the earth. Dr. 8. J. Hunter, describing
the emergence of spring cankerworms in Kansas in 1917, says:
“ Around the base of the large elms, and for several feet away the
ground appeared to be moving, so abundant were the insects; and as
these moved up the trees others kept emerging from the ground in
such numbers as to form a regular procession.” Furthermore, he
adds: “The insects ascend, apparently alike, all standing objects.

Bands on maple trees caught as many as bands on adjoining trees.
The same can be said of telegraph poles or stone hitching posts.”

CANKERWORMS—SNODGRASS 329

Ordinarily, however, the insects are too few in numbers to be
often observed in transit from the places of emergence to the tree
trunk; and whether in such cases, under variable weather condi-
tions, the journey is long or short, whether it involves a devious
search, whether some sense or instinct unerringly guides the travel-
ers, or whether many miss their destinations, has not been deter-
mined. The writer, however, once marked four active fall canker-
worm females with spots of white water-color paint and placed
them on the ground on four sides of an apple tree at 4, 6, 7, and 8
feet, respectively, from the base of the trunk. On the sixth day
following, which was the 1st day of December, one of the marked
individuals was found on the trunk of the tree, about 214 feet above
the ground. The one placed at 7 feet had
been missing for five days. During these five
days, then, she had made the journey of 7
feet over the ground. The night after she
was missed from the starting point a light
snow fell and lay on the ground most of the
next day. The succeeding days were bright,
though cold and raw. The other three moths
were still at or near the places where they
had been set out. Several more females were
then marked in a similar manner and placed
beneath trees, but only the one just described
was ever recovered. This one, during the
afterncon of the day of her arrival on the
tree trunk, moved a foot and a half higher
and then remained at this point until 11
o’clock on the morning of the following day.
After this she was seen no more, probably
having continued her journey up the trunk
and out on one of the branches of the tree. “", ale: mens
Many of the females wait a much longer time in resting position on
on the trunk of the tree before proceeding ESE!
upward. Some sit in one spot through several days and nights.
Whether they are detained by unpropitious weather or whether they
wait for a male was not determined. Only one pair of mated moths
was observed, and they were found about 10 o’clock one morning on
the upper end of the trunk of an apple tree.

The males of the fall cankerworm (fig. 15) resemble the males of
the spring cankerworm, though they are more yellowish-brown in
color, and have the outer margin of each fore wing marked with a
pale grayish spot toward the tip. In Connecticut, they may fre-
quently be seen on warm afternoons of November fluttering along
the roadsides or flitting about in the orchards. A male canker moth

330 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

flies in a very uncertain manner, first going off on a wavy course, up
and down, or edging along without making much headway, then
perhaps holding a sustained flight for several yards, finally to bring
up precipitously in a tree or shrub as if the effort had taken the last
bit of his strength. Ordinarily the males sit by day against the
trunks of the trees with wings folded fiat over the back, or they rest
on a stem or twig with the wings bent forward against the sides of
the body and the support (fig. 15).

The moths of both sexes of the fall cankerworm, as those of the
spring canker, take no food, the mouth parts and most of the alimen-
tary canal being rudimentary. The posterior part of the intestine,
however, acts as a reservoir for the products of the excretory Mal-
pighian tubules and becomes filled with a semiliquid, orange-red
mass. In the female the eggs completely fill the body cavity, occupy-
ing all available space clear up to the front of the thorax. They are
packed in jumbled masses in eight long, thin-walled sacs, which are
the distended ovarian tubules.

The moths are never very active out of doors, but they show more
animation on warm nights than they do on cold nights. When kept
in cages in a room they remain quiet all day, but with the approach
of evening, though the room be brightly illuminated with electric
light, the males begin to flutter restlessly about, and the females are
soon running briskly in all directions. Somehow they know when
night comes, regardless of artificial conditions of light and tempera-
ture, once more demonstrating they they are not slaves of external
conditions.

By a few simple expedients a female cankerworm moth can be
made to give some interesting demonstrations of certain tempera-
mental traits she possesses. If one is placed on a table at night and
an electric light is held within 2 feet of her but to one side, she shows
at once that light has a very powerful attraction for her. She
immediately runs rapidly toward it. If the light is moved about
over the table the moth follows every motion of it, and can be made
to describe circles and all kinds of intricate figures until the experi-
menter tires of the sport.

This idiosyncrasy of the moth for going toward the light is an
example of what biologists call tropisms. A tropism (from the
Greek trepein, to turn) is an innate quality in an animal that makes
it react in one way or another to external stimuli, without its “ will”
having anything to do with its actions. Tropisms may be either
positive or negative according as the animal turns toward or away
from the source of the stimulus. Plants also have tropisms, as for
example, the well known habit of the sunflower for turning its
face toward the sun. The property of being stimulated to movement
by light is designated phototropism.
CANKERWORMS—SNODGRASS 881

Another experiment with our moth will show that she possesses an
impulse to go upward. Place an active individual on the side of a
vertical block of wood and she immediately starts to ascend it.
Turn the block end for end, she reverses and starts upward once.
more, and again the experimenter may amuse or instruct himself
indefinitely or until he wearies of reversing the block. Any creature
possessed of this innate impulse to go upward is said by the savants
of tropisms to be endowed with negative geotropism, signifying that
something impels it to go away from the earth.

Besides phototropism and geotropism there are many other tro-
pisms; that is, if tropism is anything more than a theory, or a name
for something we do not understand. Reaction to heat is ¢hermo-
tropism; reaction to water is hydrotropism; reaction to chemical
substances is chemotropism, the last ordinarily called smell or taste
in animals with conscious perceptions. But all tropisms in animals
are supposed to act in a purely mechanical way by affecting the
muscles of locomotion or those by which the movements of the crea-
ture are directed. Thus, in the case of phototropism, if the light is
coming at an angle, it strikes on one eye stronger than on the other,
and if the animal is endowed at the time with positive phototropism,
the reflex nerve current generated by the light on the optic nerve
stimulates the muscles most strongly on the side of the body with
the eye that receives the most light. These muscles contract, the
body bends toward the light until both eyes receive the same stimulus.
The creature must inevitably go toward the source of the light. If
it is a flying moth it beats itself against the globe or burns itself in
the flame, unless it possesses a strong negative thermotropism; then
the heat repels it and it flies in circles about the light.

The mechanical idea of tropism was first invented to explain the
movements of certain plants, and was later extended to animals to
account for the definite responses to specific stimuli by such animals
as could not be supposed to receive conscious sense impressions or to
have the power of voluntary action. Now there is a tendency to
explain the acts of all animals as tropisms. A study of the behavior
of animals under different conditions, however, necessitates a modli-
fication of the extreme mechanistic conception of tropisms as applied
to animals. Night-flying moths, for example, are attracted by arti-
ficial lights but are nocturnal in their habits; they are positively
phototropic only up to a certain degree of intensity of light. We
have noted, also, that the nocturnal cankerworm moths become
active in a cage as evening approaches, regardless of artificial illumi-
nation about them. They appear, therefore, to have regularly re-
curring periods of activity which are not influenced by local ex-
ternal conditions. Periodic activity of this sort is known as physio-
logical rhythm. Many insects and other animals are endowed with it.
332 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

The persistent going upward of the cankerworm moth might ap-
pear to the observer to be due to her center of gravity being behind
the bases of her legs, which, by a natural equilibrium on a vertical
surface, would swing her head upward and induce her to go in this
. direction as the one easiest to follow. But let her ascend to the top
of the block and see what she does there. She very simply goes
around the edge of the top surface and then proceeds down on the
other side. The descent is made partly in a position with the head
down and the abdomen straight up, and partly in a sidewise attitude
with the body sustained horizontally. Clearly, then, the moth is not
guided in climbing by any mechanical adjustment of her weight
with regard to gravity.

A child watching a canker moth go up the block, encircle the top,
and then go down again would say the moth found no way of going

; higher and so did the nat-
ural thing in going down
again. The biologist, how-
ever, who has invoked a
tropism to get the moth up
to the top of the block,
must invoke another to get

vertical surface.

In this connection it is interesting to note that when the moth is
on a vertical surface the light does not attract her. She persists in
going up or down regardless of where the electric bulb may be held,
though on the horizontal surface she once more follows its lead.
Hither, then, her geotropism is stronger than her phototropism, or
the condition of being on a vertical surface somehow inhibits her
response to light.

The writer is not particularly recommending the theory of tro-
pisms as applied to animals. The evidence in favor of it has been
presented too exclusively by its devotees, the work of skeptics would
be more convincing. But a careful study of all the facts bearing
on the habits and behavior of insects, and the physical and physio-
logical conditions that modify them, is very much to be desired, re-
gardless of what conception we may have of the inner workings of

open many new lines of attack in our efforts to control the ravages

When the female fall cankerworm moth is ready to deposit her
eggs, she selects a site most anywhere on the limbs or twigs of the
tree she has ascended. The eggs are stuck to the surface of the bark
(fig. 16, A), not tucked away in cracks or crevices as are those of the
spring cankerworm. When placed ona large limb they are spread out
in a flat mass, but on smaller branches the mass is curved to fit the con-
tour, and on the twigs it may almost completely encircle the support

after falling from the twig

like a cylindrical jacket (fig. 16, B). Each egg looks like a minia-
ture earthenware jar (fig. 17, B, C), grayish in color, flat on top,
rounded at the bottom. The eggs all stand close together, fastened to
the bark by a gluey substance which the female discharges from
glands connected with the opening of her egg duct. The eggs are
often so evenly placed that their tops form regular rows in three
directions across the surface of the mass. Usually there are between
200 and 300 eggs in each mass, but there may be as many as 400.
After disposing of her eggs, the female in most cases is shrunken
and exhausted. Of two moths that deposited the last of their eggs
in captivity on November 9 and 10, respectively, one sat beside them
334 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

on the twig for a day and a half, the other for two whole days. Most
of the time each maintained the curious attitude shown at A and B
of Figure 18, the body being propped up almost vertical on the front
and hind pairs of legs, while the two middle legs were slowly waved
in the air. Finally the moths became so weak that the legs failed
to maintain the grasp on the twig, and each in turn dropped to the
surface of the table below, landing legs upward, and remained help-
lessly in this position. But life was not yet extinct. The female that
deposited her eggs on the ninth lay for three full days slowly moving
one leg (fig. 18, C); the other showed similar but decreasing signs
of life, until finally there was but a feeble trembling of one foot. Both
died on the 14th, five and four days, respectively, after egg laying.

On the other hand, active and plump-looking females are some-
times taken out of doors, which, when killed and dissected, are found
to be completely devoid of eggs. These eggless females almost
always have a large bubble of gas in the thorax, contained in a sack-
like pouch of the esophagus. Specimens with eggs were never found
to contain this air bubble. All of the females, however, undoubtedly
soon perish; and the males must encounter a similar fate.

The lives of these creatures seem to us to be but periods of miserable
existence, activated by an incomprehensible devotion to a physical
duty. Yet, there is no reason to believe that they suffer; they are
simply differently constituted in some way from the majority of
insects. Their lives are as normal as are those of the warmth-loving
moths that flock to our lights on hot summer evenings, or of the seem-
ingly care-free butterflies that frequent our gardens on sunny after-
noons, where they meet their affinities or refresh themselves from the
nectar of the flowers.

The eggs of the fall cankerworm remain on the trees all winter to
hatch next spring about the first of May, or about the time the new
leaves are unfolding. When nature gives the signal, the caterpillar
within the egg gnaws an irregular hole in the top of its cell large
enough to permit its head to emerge (fig. 19). Then a long, slim
body suddenly shoots out, pulls itself free from its prison, and the
young cankerworm loops away in search of its first meal.

A BOTANICAL TRIP TO ECUADOR, PERU, AND BOLIVIA

By A. S. HircHcock

[With 15 plates]

In order to obtain direct information concerning the grasses of
the central Andes region a trip was made in 1923 to Ecuador, Peru,
and Bolivia, leaving Washington in May and returning in February.
The work was primarily for the Department of Agriculture but
that done in Ecuador was in cooperation with the Gray Herbarium
of Harvard University and the New York Botanical Garden.

ITINERARY IN ECUADOR

Arriving at Guayaquil June 16, several days were spent in estab-
lishing connections. Dr. F. W. Goding, our efficient consul general
at this city, was very helpful throughout my stay in Ecuador.
Through the courtesy of Mr. Orr, geologist, and Mr. Clark, manager,
five days were spent at a camp between Guayaquil and Salinas
where a well was being sunk in search for petroleum. After collect-
ing a few days in the vicinity of Guayaquil, headquarters were re-
moved to Huigra on the railroad to Quito at an altitude of 4,000
feet. Three excursions were made from Huigra to the coastal plain.
The first was to Ingenio Valdez, near Milago, a sugar plantation
and factory, of which Sr. S. Perez Conto is manager. Mr. Meigs,
superintendent, and Mr. Platts, chemist, are Americans. Mr. Pa-
chano, an Ecuadorian botanist, aided greatly here in the collecting
of material. The second visit was to Teresita, a plantation owned
by Mr. J. A. Cleveland, an American long resident in Ecuador.
This plantation lies in a very wet belt at the foot of the mountains.
The third visit was to the Panigén plantation, 8 miles south of
Milago. The manager of this plantation is Mr. James Rorer, the
well-known mycologist, formerly of the United States Department
ef Agriculture and of Trinidad, West Indies.

After collecting several days at Huigra, headquarters were trans-
ferred to Quito July 31. August 5 to August 15 were occupied by
an overland trip to Tulc4n at the Colombian border, accompanied
by Mr. J. R. McWilliam, of Quito, who was friend, guide, and in-
terpreter. The route lay through La Providencia, Otavalo, Ibarra,

339
336 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

La Rinconada, and the return about the same way, passing through
Malchingui and Pomasqui. La Rinconada is a large ranch, whose
owner, Sefior Tomayo, courteously entertained us. After our return
to Quito a visit was made to Pichincha, a volcanic cone 15,000 feet
high a few miles from the city. The next overland trip was made
in company with Mr. McWilliam through southern Ecuador, August
25 to September 138. Going from Guayaquil to Santa Rosa by
boat we took horses for the remainder of the way. The first stage,
two days, brought us to Portovelo, a gold mine in charge of Ameri-
cans. The manager, Mr. Tweedy, whom I met in Quito, and Mr.
Kellogg, the superintendent, entertained us here, and the American
conditions, including food, were surely a pleasant break in the
primitive life we had been living. The second stage, three days,
brought us to Loja by way of El Tambo and La Toma. The third
stage, four days’ travel and one day’s rest, brought us to Cuenca, the
third city in Ecuador. The route lay through San Lucas, Ojia, and
Naboén. The fourth and last stage, two days, took us to Huigra on
the railroad.

In September Mr. McWilliam and I journeyed into the Oriente
a short distance, starting from Ambato. At the end of the first day
we reached Bafios and the second day Cashurco. We returned to
Ambato at the end of the fourth day. On October 4 an ascent of
Chimborazo was made to snow line at about 16,000 feet, starting
from Urbina on the Guayaquil and Quito railroad (11,841 feet).
This ended the field work in Ecuador.

TOPOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE OF ECUADOR

Ecuador has three well-marked regions—the coastal plain, be-
tween the Pacific Ocean and the Andes, the mountains with their
interior valleys, and the vast forested region to the east of the
mountains, the Oriente.

The coastal plain is about 100 miles wide, and gradually rises to
the base of the mountains where the elevation is about 1,000 feet
(at Bucay on the railroad). The rainfall is heavy in the Colom-
bian coast region and in northern Ecuador but decreases rapidly
southward and one soon arrives at desert conditions in northern
Peru. The temperature of the tropical west coast of South America
south of the equator is much modified by the cool Humboldt. cur-
rent coming up along the coast from the Antarctic regions. The
coastal cities are not as warm as the latitude would indicate. The
average temperature for Guayaquil is 27° (80° F.) for the year,
2814° (83° F.) in January and 2514° (78° F.) in July. The maxi-
mum of 35° (95° F.) and the minimum of 19° (66° F.) are very
rarely attained. The daily variation of temperatures is usually less
BOTANICAL TRIP—HITCHCOCK 337

than 15° F. The rainfall by months in inches (United States
Weather Bureau) is as follows:

The mountainous portion of Ecuador, the Cordillera, consists of
two main nearly parallel chains with high valleys or plateaus be-
tween. The interior valley is divided into depressions by cross
ridges. The only railroad of importance runs from Guayaquil east
to Bucay and there begins the ascent of a valley, climbing past
Huigra and Alausi to the pass at about 10,000 feet, then descends
into one of the valleys to Riobamba, then over another pass, at
Urbina (nearly 12,000 feet) on the flank of Chimborazo, and into
another valley with Ambato as its center. There is ancther pass
in the vicinity of Cotopaxi, and one then descends into the valiey
of Quito, the northern terminus of the railroad. The valleys are
8,000 to 10,000 feet altitude. Further northward there are the
valleys in which lie the cities of Ibarra and Tulcan. The climate
in these valleys is temperate and equable. The altitude of Quito
is about 9,500 feet, and the climate is more bleak than at Ambato
at about 8,500 where it is very satisfactory. The average yearly
temperature at Quito is about 1214° (5414° F.) but the daily varia-
tion may be as much as 18° (32° F.). The rainy season is from
January to May, and the total average annual precipitation is 1,120
mm. (40 inches), but since the city lies between two regions of oppo-
site rainfall periods (in the east Andes the rainy season is from
March to November) there is some rain during the dry season.
The average total for the five months of the rainy season, January
to May, is 654 mm. (according to Hann, Handbuch der Klimatol-
ogie), and 463 mm. for the dry season, June to December.

There are about 20 snow-capped peaks in the Ecuadorean Cor-
dillera, some of them being among the highest of the Andes. The
three best known outside cf the country are Chimborazo (about
20,500 feet), Cotopaxi (about 19,500), and Tunguragua (about
16,700 feet). These are majestic volcanic cones visible at a great
distance.

The ladder-like structure of the Cordillera of Ecuador is shown
by the following table. The route from Tulcain on the north to Loja
on the south traverses eight major passes. The cities lie in the valleys
between. The passes are at approximately the lowest point in the
cross range. The heights in meters are taken from Wolf (Geografia
' y Geologia del Ecuador), the equivalent being given as feet in paren-

Travelers’ Guide to Latin America (Dept. Commerce, Misc. Ser. 89).

The highland of the Andes is usually known as the sierra. The
forested slopes of the eastern side are called the montafia. The high,
treeless regions below snow line are called paramos, the same name
being used in Colombia.

The Oriente is the region lying east of the Cordillera in the val-
ley of the Amazon. It gradually merges into the montafia of the
east slope and is only partially explored. The inhabitants are mostly
indios or aboriginal tribes, though there are a few settlements of
half-casts and negroes along the rivers, with here and there a white
man. The Oriente is in the main covered with virgin forest and
travel is chiefly by canoe at the lower altitudes. In the western
portion where the rivers are too precipitous for canoes the travel
is by trail, but owing to the high rainfall, the absence of bridges,
and the general defectiveness of the paths, the going is difficult.
Much of the Oriente is disputed territory between Ecuador and
Peru. On Peruvian maps the boundary line runs about 20 miles
east of Loja, Ambato, and Ibarra.

CITIES AND RAILROADS IN ECUADOR

Aside from the disputed Oriente, Ecuador has an area of about
120,000 square miles, about the size of Arizona or New Mexico. The
largest city, Guayaquil, has a population of about 100,000, and
Quito, the capital and second city, a population of about half as much.

The most important railroad, the Guayaquil and Quito, goes
across the coastal plain from Duran, opposite Guayaquil, and
ascends a valley to the sierra, passing by Huigra and Alausi. The
building of the road here was difficult and the scenery is correspond-
ingly magnificent. In places there was not room for curves, so switch-
backs or zigzags were resorted to. After rising over a pass at Pal-
myra a bleak wind-swept paramo of about 10,000 feet altitude, the
road descends to the valley of Riobamba, which is the terminus for
the first day’s travel, as the trains do not run at night. The second
lay the train passes over the flank of Chimborazo, which great snow-
BOTANICAL TRIP—HITCHCOCK 339

covered cone is a magnificent sight in clear weather, the road reach-
ing an ultimate altitude at Urbina of nearly 12,000 feet, then on into
the valley of Ambato and Latacunga, over another pass near the
great peak of Cotopaxi, and finally descending to Quito, which lies
in a sort of bowl. A few minor railroads lead inland a short dis-
tance from some of the coast towns. The commerce of the interior
cities that are not served by the railroad is by means of pack trains
over roads that are much used and rarely repaired.

PRODUCTS OF ECUADOR

The chief industry of Ecuador is agriculture. The mineral re-
sources are great, but through lack of suitable facilities for trans-
portation these resources have been only partially developed. There
is a large gold mine at Portovelo, in southern Ecuador, where we
had the privilege of staying a few days on our journey through this
region. Copper and other metals are also found and petroleum is
produced in the region west of Guayaquil.

The chief agricultural export product is cacao, from which choco-
late is made. The industry has been threatened recently by a dis-
ease, witches’-broom, which has greatly reduced the output in cer-
tain regions.

Sugar raising is an important industry but the product is chiefly
used within the country. Considerable coffee is exported, and for-
merly the ivory nuts and rubber were important products.

The making of Panama hats is the leading manufacturing in-
dustry, of which the export value for 1920 was $1,500,000. These are
made from a palm growing on the coastal plain and are woven or
plaited by hand. In some localities a large part of the population
from children to the aged take part in the manufacture.

In the valleys of the interior the usual crops of temperate re-
cions are raised, mostly for home consumption, such as wheat, bar-
ley, and alfalfa. Stock raising is increasing in importance.

COLLECTING PLANTS IN ECUADOR

As the work in Ecuador was of a cooperative nature as indicated .
in the first paragraph, the collecting included all kinds of flowering
plants of which three sets were obtained. The collection included
2,137 numbers (19914 to 22050), a large part of which were obtained
in triplicate. A sufficient amount of stock newspaper sheets cut to
folders 1114 by 1614 inches, the so-called inner sheets, was taken
from America for the entire trip as one can not depend upon getting
such things in Ecuador. Also there were taken about 500 driers, and
200 sheets of corrugated paper faced on one side. Two kerosene
- cooking lamps with 4-inch wicks furnished the heat. Packages of
340 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

plants, placed over a stove and surrounded by a curtain of cloth to
force the hot air through the packages, would dry in a few hours.
The corrugated paper between the specimens allowed a free circu-
lation of hot air.

When collections were made at towns along the railroad and one
could do the drying at a hotel there was little difficulty in prepar-
ing specimens. In visiting outlying places and traveling overland
certain modifications were necessary.

The usual method of travel overland is to hire horses or mules
with driver for a definite stage, usually not to exceed two or three
days. In addition one should have a guide and interpreter. In the
present case I was fortunate in having the services of Mr. J. R. Mc-
William, a young Seventh-day Adventist missionary of Quito, who
spoke Spanish and was familiar with the country and its customs.
Most of the natives—that is, the Indians—speak Quichua and often
little or no Spanish. The mule driver, however, could act as an in-
terpreter for Quichua. The outfit was reduced to simple terms and
was carried on two pack animals.

It is essential to successful travel that one should preserve one’s
health. In the uplands there was no malaria but dysentery and
other intestinal diseases were common. To avoid dysentery and
typhoid one should drink no unboiled water and eat no uncooked
vegetables. Fresh fruit should be inspected and peeled with care.

Since the travel was in a primitive country it was necessary to
provide certain comforts in order not to be worn out with the con-
tinuous strain of horseback riding. I took with me from Washington
a McClellan army saddle and a saddle blanket, also a folding army
cot with pad or thin mattress, and blankets. In actual travel navy
duftle sacks of heavy canvas were used to hold the baggage, one sack
on each side of a mule. The cot and pad filled one sack. A supple-
mentary supply of food was taken as one could not depend upon
getting what one needed at small inns or tambos. Such supplies
included condensed milk, sugar, tea, butter, sardines, canned salmon,
canned fruit, and crackers. Sometimes it was necessary to stop at
- Indian huts. Bread could rarely be obtained except in the larger
places. Milk, butter, and sugar were luxuries. Hot water could
always be furnished and usually caldo, a kind of stew or soup with
potato and scraps of other things—just what other things one could
not know. Eggs could sometimes be obtained. Candles were a neces-
sary part of the equipment as light is rarely furnished at small places.
The towns are situated in fertile valleys and these, being highly
cultivated, furnish little of value to the plant collector. The inter-
esting plants were obtained in going over the passes. On the other
hand the limiting factor determining the arrangements for each
BOTANICAL TRIP—HITCHCOCK 341

day’s journey was feed for the animals. The mules are not given
grain but depend upon cut green feed. This is fed at night and
morning, and when possible at noon. In the uplands the fodder is
usually alfalfa. Other fodder given in certain localities where
alfalfa was not available was green cornstalks, sugar cane, bamboo,
cachi (Awonopus scoparius), and in one region in southern Ecuador,
cakes of raw sugar. Because of the necessity of stopping overnight
in the towns we were often hurried in our collecting on the passes.
We could camp in the collecting areas but we could not provide
feed for the animals—a prime consideration in traveling. In some
places there was grass, but it was not practicable to allow the animals
to roam over grassland at night. If they are not lost they have at
least been unable to take proper rest and are likely to give out the
next day.

Since we drank no unboiled water, we depended on large quantities
of weak tea at our meals, supplemented occasionally by bottled water
or “pop” at the larger towns. Travelers generally depend on bot-
tled beer or other alcoholic drink which is widely distributed, being
sold at the smallest roadside shop, but we were at a disadvantage as
we did not drink beer.

It was fortunate that I took with me a cot. This I used even
though there were a bed in the room. Insect pests were usually pres-
ent in the smaller hotels or in the Indian huts where it was necessary
to stop. The usual pests were fleas, bedbugs, and lice. In setting
up the cot I was careful not to let it or any of my belongings touch
the walls. Furthermore, at Indian huts I would not have been
allowed to stop if I could not furnish my own bed. Being a white
man, the natives would not consent to have me share their simple
belongings after their own manner.

ITINERARY IN PERU

Peru was entered at Callao, the port of Lima, which lies a few
miles inland. Lima is a fine modern city. The climate here is fine,
and, though in the Tropics at near sea level, the heat is never oppres-
sive. The whole coast south of Ecuador is kept cool by the Hum-
boldt Current coming up from the south. Two days were spent at
Lima establishing connections for further work.

The first trip was to the interior over a wonderful mountain rail-
road to Oroya. The train leaves Lima about 7 a. m. and for three
hours traverses the coastal plain. Then it starts to climb the great
Cordillera through a most amazing series of gorges, crossing deep
valleys and skirting precipices. At about 3 p. m. the summit of the
pass (in a tunnel) is reached at nearly 16,000 feet (15,689 feet) and
‘ then descends to the town of Oroya at about 12,000 feet. Thus in five
203897—25——23
342 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

hours one ascends from near sea level to nearly 16,000 feet, a great
strain on the bodily organs, and many people are attacked by soroche
or mountain sickness. The tunnel at the summit is 3,859 feet long
and the place is surrounded by high snow-capped peaks and ridges
rising 1,000 to 2,000 feet higher. The vegetation here appeared to go
up to almost 17,000 feet. Some idea of the remarkable railroad
may be obtained from the fact that on the road, including the
branch to Huancayo, there are 65 tunnels, 10 of them being more
than 500 feet in length, 21 switchbacks or zigzags, and 61 bridges.
The scenery is indescribably grand.

Through the courtesy of the Cerro de Pasco Copper Co., I was
able to stop at the company’s hotel and also later at Cerro de Pasco.
Krom Oroya I went by auto to Tarma and then to La Merced,
descending to about 3,000 feet. ‘The next morning I went on horse-
back to Colonia Perené, a large coffee plantation on the Perené River
at about 2,000 feet altitude, in the Amazon Valley. I presented
my letter of introduction from the Peruvian Corporation in Lima
and was cordially entertained during my stay by the manager, Sefor
Valle-Riestre. On the plantation are 1,600,000 coffee trees.

On the return from the Perené Colony I went to Junin, on the
road to Cerro de Pasco, where I was met by an agent of the Atoc-
saico Ranch who conducted me to the ranch about 12 miles to the
west. Here I was kindly looked after by Mr. McKenzie, the man-
ager of the ranch, to whom I had a letter from Sefor Rizo-Patron.

Atocsaico is a sheep ranch at about 13,000 feet altitude, containing
11,000 acres. The sheep graze the year around and there is plenty
of water. The equipment is modern and in good condition. The
annual production of wool is about 60 tons. I was surprised to
learn that one of the pests against which they are constantly fight-
ing is the condor. I saw a huge pile of wings which represented
dead condors for which a bonus had been paid. There are no trees
on the ranch as the altitude is too great for their growth. The fuel
is dried turf. It was interesting to note that they make their own
lime from native limestone using sheep manure for fuel.

The next stopping place was Cerro de Pasco, a cold bleak min-
ing town at an altitude of 14,300 feet. The road from Oroya to
Cerro de Pasco lies over a great plateau or plain several miles wide
at about 138,000 feet. Mr. Philpott, the superintendent, was very
courteous to me and made arrangements for a visit to Goyllarisquisca.
Fortunately, I was not at all affected by soroche or I should have
been much inconvenienced by work at high altitudes. Mr. Philpott
stated that 7 out of 10 people suffer when they first come but 75 per
cent of these recover in a few days. Others must descend to lower
altitudes at once or serious results may follow. The high altitude
had a noticeable effect in that my lungs did not get sufficient air
BOTANICAL TRIP—-HITCHCOCK 3438

while at rest and I would suddenly require a long breath. This
became troublesome as I was going to sleep. My lungs accustomed
to slow down would not supply sufficient oxygen and I would gasp
for breath at the point of losing consciousness thus bringing me wide
awake. This condition might continue for half an hour before if
would finally go to sleep.

From Cerro de Pasco a trip was made on horseback to La Quin-
hua, 3,000 feet lower down a rocky valley, and another by rail to
Goyllarisquisca. From near the latter place we descended on a
cable car 5,000 feet to a coal mine. In this vicinity grasses were in
good condition and a fine collection was made.

On returning to Lima I took a steamer for Mollendo, a port in
southern Peru. In general the whole coast of Peru and northern
Chile is a desert, rain coming at infrequent intervals. Sometimes
one to several years, or even as much as 15 years, will pass between
showers. At Mollendo the conditions are such that rains, though
infrequent, come oftener than at other parts of the coast. At the
time of my arrival the hills back of the town were green as a result
of recent rains. I took advantage of these favorable circumstances
to make a collection of the entire flora. The verdure extended for
a narrow belt over only a few miles and back of this all was desert
again.

From Mollendo I went by the Southern Railroad to Arequipa
a fine city at 7,500 feet altitude. On the way we passed the curious
crescent-shaped sand dunes that are moving across a desert plain.
These are 10 to 15 feet high and about 100 feet across, all the same
shape and about the same size, thousands of them, moving in the
direction of the prevailing wind, high in the center and tapering
out to the point of each crescent. The plain itself was of brown
dirt but the dunes were nearly white, thus conspicuously set off.

As an example of the coincidences of personal contacts, I may
record that I met here Mr. Delgado Vivanco, whose brother was
a classmate of my son’s at college and who extended to me at Are-
quipa many courtesies. Arequipa is beautifully situated. In the
vicinity are three high snow-capped mountains, Chachani (20,000
feet), Misti (19,150 feet), and Pichu-Pichu (17,800 feet). Misti,
close by, is a nearly perfect cone.

After leaving Arequipa I went to Juliaca, where the road
branches, one division going to Cuzco, the other to La Paz. The
trains run only by day and only twice a week. The first stage is
Mollendo to Arequipa, the second from Arequipa to Juliaca, and the
third from Juliaca to Cuzco on to La Paz. Ihad a letter of introduc-
tion to Colonel Stordy, director of the experiment station at Chu-
-quibambilla on the road toward Cuzco. I remained at the station as
his guest over one train. The ranch contains 18,000 acres and is
344 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

devoted mainly to sheep, of which they have about 15,000 head.
The altitude is about 12,500 feet. The grazing here is fine.

The road to Cuzco continues over a great plateau 13,000 to 14,000
feet altitude, passing over a divide at 14,153 feet and descending to
Cuzco at 11,000 feet. Cuzco is one of the old Inca cities and shows
much evidence of Inca architecture. The Spaniards destroyed a
large part of the old city, but many of the foundation walls remain
upon which modern structures have been built. One can discern
at a glance the difference between the old and the new. The old
Inca walls are much more substantial and better made as a rule.
In the outskirts are the well-known ruins of extensive fortifications,
which I examined with interest and of which I took several photo-
graphs. ‘The old walls are remarkable for the great size of many
of the stones, weighing many tons. The largest stone is said to
weigh 361 tons, and some of them to measure 27 by 14 by 12 feet.
The second remarkable feature of the walls is the perfect fitting of
the stones which are set without mortar or cement.

Through the kindness of officials whom I met at Cuzco I was able
to make a trip on a new railroad to Ollantaytambo and by horse
about 12 miles further down the valley toward Santa Ana, the
ultimate destination of the road.

At Ollantaytambo there are more Inca ruins. On top of a very
steep hill are several fine walls. Also there are 6 large stones 13
by 7 by 6 feet. How were they brought up here? The stones for
all the structures were brought from a quarry many miles away.
The builders had no beasts of burden except the inefficient llama,
and no iron for instruments.

TOPOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE OF PERU

In a general way the topography is similar to that of Ecuador.
There is a coastal plain between the mountains and the Pacific
Ocean; a mountain mass, the Cordillera, extending north and south;
and to the east a forested slope in the Amazon Valley. These three
regions are usually referred to as La Cuesta, the Sierra, and the
Montana.

The coastal plain (La Cuesta) is extremely dry and, with the
plain of northern Chile, constitutes one of the great desert regions
of the world. There are numerous rivers, however, fed by mountain
snows, that find their way across the desert to the ocean. The
valleys of these rivers are occupied by an agricultural population
that utilizes to the full the water for irrigation. As there are no
railroads running north and south to connect these centers of popu-
lation, there is little communication between them. In most cases
the area of cultivation is some distance from the coast and the
towns are connected with a seaport by a short railroad. The outlet

BOTANICAL TRIP—HITCHCOCK 345

in all these cases is by sea, the isolated communities being served by
coastwise steamers.

The Cordillera is broader than in Ecuador and consists, through
much of Peru, of two more or less distinct ranges. The valleys be-
tween are, in places, high broad plains or plateaus with an elevation
of 12,000 to 14,000 feet. There are numerous lofty peaks, several
more than 18,000 feet. The mountain region, especially the part
above tree line, is called the Sierra. The high plains and ridges
below snow line are called punas, puna corresponding to paramo in
Ecuador and Colombia.

The forested slope to the east, the Montafia, runs off into a com-
paratively uninhabited region as in Ecuador. But the subtropical
slopes and valleys in the foothills are highly cultivated.

The climate of Peru is so varied that no general statement of
value can be given. The coastal plain is dry and comparatively
cool though tropical. The Montajfa is strictly tropical and for the
most part has a high rainfall. The Sierra is temperate and on the
high plateaus may be cold and bleak:

The temperatures and rainfall for three places will give a good
idea of the climate in a general way.

Lima on the coastal plain near sea level. Yearly average temper-
ature 19° (66° F.); average for August 15.9° (60° F.); average for
February 23° (73° F.). The average annual rainfall is 46 mm. (1.8
inches) of which 26 mm. (1 inch) fall in August and September.

Arequipa, 7,500 feet altitude, on the Pacific slope of the Andes.
Yearly average temperature 13.5° (5614° F.); average for June, the
coldest month, 13.2° (5514° F.); average for October, the hottest
month, 14° (5714° F.). The average annual rainfall is 147 mm, (6
inches) of which 142 mm. fall in January, February, and March.

Cuzco, in the Sierra, at 11,000 feet altitude. Yearly average tem-
perature 10° (50° F.); average for July, the coldest month, 7.7°
(46° F.) ; average for November, the hottest month, 11.3° (5214° F.).
The average annual rainfall is 980 mm. (39 inches).

In the Montafia of eastern Peru the rainfall rises to 100 inches.

CITIES AND RAILROADS OF PERU

Lima, the capital of Peru, is a fine city of about 225,000 inhabi-
tants and has many modern buildings. Callao, its seaport, with
about 50,000 inhabitants, is a few miles away, but the two cities are
now nearly continuous. Arequipa has a population of 55,000 and
Cuzco of 30,000.

Aside from the railroads connecting small seaports with the
interior agricultural valleys of the coastal plain, there are two main
lines in Peru. These have been mentioned in a preceding para-
graph. The first goes from Callao to Oroya and on to Cerro de
346 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Pasco, with a branch from Oroya to Huancayo. The other goes
from Mollendo to Cuzco, with a branch from Juliaca to Lake Titi-
caca and on to La Paz.

Another road goes on from Cuzco to Goyllarisquisca and a new
road is under construction from Cuzco down the Urubamba Valley
to Santa Ana. Several of the rivers of eastern Peru, branches of
the Amazon, are navigable. Iquitos in the northeast is the outlet
for all this part of Peru. Iquitos though 2,300 miles from the
mouth of the Amazon has an altitude of only 350 feet. There are
regular steamship connections with Manaos and Para in Brazil, at
which latter place one can get steamers to the United States and
Europe.

PRODUCTS OF PERU

Agriculture and mining are the two great industries. Among
agricultural products sugar takes the lead and cotton is second.
These crops are raised chiefly in the irrigated valleys of the coastal
plain. In the Montafia of the east coffee is important, and in cer-
tain localities coca. There is also some cacao and rice. Formerly
rubber was a very important product from the wild trees in eastern
Peru, but of late years the cultivated product from the East Indies
has replaced it.

In the temperate regions of the Sierra the products are corn,
wheat, barley, alfalfa, potatoes, and beans (the broad bean of Eu-
rope). ‘These crops are raised, under favorable conditions, up to
about 12,000 feet.

The mineral products of Peru are numerous, with copper taking
the lead and silver second. Petroleum is increasing in importance.

ITINERARY IN BOLIVIA

After leaving Cuzco I went to La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, by
way of Juliaca and Lake Titicaca. The train leaves Cuzco in the
morning and, changing at Juliaca, arrives at Guaqui on Lake Titi-
caca in the evening. Here passengers take a small but comfortable
steamer, with cabins, and cross the lake during the night. Lake
Titicaca is the largest lake in South America, having an area of
about 3,200 square miles. It is 180 miles long and has a maximum
depth of 892 feet. The altitude is about 12,500 feet. The shores are
for the most part low rather than precipitous, and there are no high
mountains in the immediate vicinity. In the morning passengers
take the train for La Paz over a plateau which gradually rises to
13,500 feet at the rim of the valley in which lies the city. It is a
strikingly beautiful sight which meets the eye as one looks for the
first time over this rim to the city of La Paz spread out in the valley
1,500 feet below. The steep side of the valley is negotiated by a
winding electric road.
BOTANICAL TRIP—-HITCHCOCK 847

Four trips were made in Bolivia, to Hlimani, to the Yungas, to
Cochabamba, and to the southern border.

Illimani is the most accessible high mountain in the vicinity of La
Paz. It lies to the east at a distance of about 30 miles and is a
dominating factor in the scenery. From my hotel window, which
faced the east, I had a beautiful view of this majestic peak, which
was perfectly framed between other mountains closer to the city.
Especially striking was the view at sunset as the glistening white
reflected from the great snow cap passed into pink and purple and
finally to a pale blue. The mountain does not end in a cone like
Chimborazo and Cotopaxi of Ecuador, but is a short ridge of about
three peaks, the highest of which is said to be 21,204 feet. Another
mountain, Sorata (also called Illampu) lies to the north of La Paz
about 60 miles, but can be seen from the city only under certain
favorable conditions. This peak is a little higher than Illimani,
21,490 feet. In company with Mr. Dagg I went by mule back and
with pack animals to Illimani, ascending to the base of the great
glacier at about 16,000 feet. It took two days to reach a ranch at the
base of the peak, one day to make the ascent, and one day to return
to La Paz. The face of the glacier is about 100 feet high and at
intervals drops masses of ice, which roll down the slope for some
distance.

The trip to the Yungas was made in company with Dr. Otto
Buchtien, the well-known German botanist, who has lived many
years in Bolivia and has collected widely in that country as well
as in neighboring parts of Peru and Chile. He has written a flora
of Bolivia and has a better knowledge of the flora of the country
than any other botanist.

The Yungas is an indefinite region lying on the Amazon slope of
the Cordillera Real or eastern chain of the Andes, and includes the
valleys and slopes of the Montafia toward the Beni River. More
specifically it includes the provinces of Nor-Yungas and Sur-Yungas.
Through the courtesy of Sr. J. B. Aramayo, director general of the
railroad now under construction from La Paz to the Yungas, we
were given facilities for the trip, including transportation on the
completed part of the road from La Paz to Pongo, and mules and
driver into the valley. The railroad ascends out of the valley of
La Paz and over the pass of the Cordillera at an altitude of about
15,300 feet to Pongo at about 12,000 feet. From here we took saddle
mules and one pack mule for a seven days’ trip through Nor- and
Sur-Yungas. First there was one long descent of 7,000 feet, then
much up and down as rivers were crossed and ridges ascended. We
passed through San Felipe and La Florida, ending the eastern
journey at Chulumani, the capital of Sur-Yungas. The route then
lay through Coripata and Coroico, the capital of Nor-Yungas, and
348 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

back by way of Bella Vista to Pongo. I was impressed with the
endurance of the mules, which had nothing but the usual supply
of green fodder yet showed no signs of exhaustion though traveling
every day and put to severe tests in the constant ascents and descents
of thousands of feet. Meantime I was collecting grasses as we trav-
eled, this requiring dismounting many times a day as specimens
were observed by the wayside.

The Yungas is a great center for the cultivation of the coca shrub,
from the leaves of which the drug cocaine is obtained. The leaves
are used almost universally by the Indians of the Sierra. The dried
leaves are rolled up with a pellet of paste made from ashes and
chewed to get the stimulating effect of the alkaloid released by the
alkali of the ashes.

The third trip, to Cochabamba, was easily made by rail. I was
greatly aided here through the cooperation of Mr. J. E. Washburn,
who has charge of the American Institute, an educational institu-
tion. Cochabamba, at an altitude of 8,500 feet has a very salubrious
climate and is a delightful place to live. It is the center of an
important agricultural district.

The last Bolivian trip which was to the southern boundary, was
made possible through the kindness of Mr. G. G. Trueheart, assistant
general manager of the Ulen Contracting Corporation at La Paz.
By rail I went to Atocha, the present terminus of the railroad
under construction from Uyuni to La Quiaca in Argentina. The
Ulen company furnished transportation from Atocha to Villazon
and return, including construction trains for a short distance at each
end and mules and driver for the hiatus between. This trip took
about 10 days. Ultimately this road will be the main line from
Buenos Aires to La Paz. La Quiaca, in Argentina, opposite Villa-
zon in Bolivia, was visited to utilize the better hotel facilities. The
whole of southern Bolivia is a desert, with many species of cactuses
and other xerophilous vegetation. The agriculture is confined to the
irrigated valleys.

After returning to Uyuni, the departure from Bolivia was made
by way of Antofagasta, Chile, where I took a Grace Line steamer for
Panama and a Panama Railroad steamer for New York.

The southwestern part of Bolivia becomes increasingly arid and
there are large areas of alkali soil devoid of vegetation. In this
region there is much borax taken out.

My work in Bolivia was greatly facilitated by Mr. Joseph Flack,
secretary of our legation at La Paz, who, in the absence of the
minister, put me in touch with officials and others who were very
helpful in forwarding my work. Before leaving La Paz I had the
pleasure of meeting our genial minister to Bolivia, Hon. Jesse S.
Cottrell.
BOTANICAL TRIP—HITCHCOCK 849
TOPOGRAPHY AND CLIMATE OF BOLIVIA

The high plateau of southern Peru between the western chain of
the Andes which southward is the boundary between Bolivia and
Chile, and the eastern chain, or Cordillera Real, broadens out in
Bolivia to form a great central high plain about 500 miles long and
with an average altitude of about 12,000 feet. East of the plateau
there is a lower plain about 500 miles wide extending to the Para-
guay river, sloping from 1,000 feet to nearly zero.

The climate corresponds to the altitude. The wet season is from
December to May, and the months from November to January are
called summer.

At La Paz (12,000 feet) the average annual temperature is 9.4°
(49.° F), the average for June 6.7° (44°F.), and for November
11.5° (538° F.). The average annual rainfall is 5388 mm. (22 inches)
of which 322 mm. fall in the summer months December to February.

At Cochabamba (8,500 feet) the average annual temperature is
17.8° (63° F.), the average for June 14° (57° F.), for November 20°
(68° F.). The rainfall is 462 mm. (18 inches), 208 mm. of which

come in December and January.

CITIES AND RAILROADS OF BOLIVIA

La Paz, the capital, has a population of 107,000, while Cocha-
bamba, Oruro, Potosi, Sucre, and Santa Cruz have a ee of
about 30,000 each.

The main line of railroad goes from La Paz to Uyuni in the
south, where it connects with the Chilean Railroad to Antofasgasta.
When, the portion between Uyuni and La Quiaca, Argentina, is
finished there will be through service from La Paz to Buenos Aires.
Trains now run to Atocha. The distance between Atocha and la
Quiaca is about 125 miles, a part of which is now covered by com-
pleted railroad, but not yet available for traffic. From this main
line there is a branch to Cochabamba and another to Postosi. Sucre
is the official capital of Bolivia, but the seat of government is in
La Paz. Sucre is connected with Postosi by automobile service
during the dry season, the time being about 10 hours. La Paz
is connected with Mollendo, Peru, by rail, as previously noted. A
third line to the coast is from La Paz to Arica in northern Chile.

PRODUCTS OF BOLIVIA

The chief products of Bolivia are minerals, of which tin, copper,
and silver take the lead, although several others are important.
The agricultural products include those that have been mentioned
for Peru, but none are exported in important amounts.

350 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924
THE LLAMA

The llama is a curious animal that always attracts the attention
of visitors. It is native to the uplands of the central Andes and
was domesticated by the early inhabitants and is still used by the
Indians extensively as a beast of burden. The long erect neck and
graceful carriage give the animal a very stately appearance. As
a carrier its efficiency is low as its load can not usually be more
than about 75 pounds and it can not go more than 10 or 15 miles
a day. For these reasons the white man has little use for it, pre-
ferring mules or burros. The reason for its slow speed is the fact
that it is a cud-chewing animal and, needing the night for rest,
it feeds during the day as it travels. No forage or grain is given,
but it depends on the native grasses. The llama fits in very well
with the agricultural economy of the natives. They cost nothing
to support, as they graze at large and the Indian has plenty of
time. They can not be used for riding animals, and when in use
they are allowed to travel in droves freely without halters or ropes.
They are rarely brought down to altitudes lower than 4,000 feet,
and are at home particularly in the central plateaus of Bolivia
and Peru, the range extending into southern Ecuador. Allied to
the Ilama is a smaller animal, the alpaca, used for flesh and wool
but not for bearing burdens. The vicufa, still smaller, is a grace-
ful little thing like a small deer but allied to the alpaca. This
animal is becoming rare and is under government protection to
prevent its extermination by the Indians who use it for food.

BOTANICAL RESULTS

The botanical results of the trip to the central Andes are of
importance. A large collection of grasses was made, which will
be the basis of an account of the grasses of the three countries
visited. Comparatively few botanists have traveled in this region.
Among the early travelers may be mentioned Humboldt and Bon-
pland, who came from the north down through Ecuador to northern
Peru, and Haenke, of the Malaspina expedition, who collected in
central Peru. The Wilkes expedition stopped at Lima, but their
collection of grasses was unimportant. Spruce, the English natur-
alist who spent several years in the Amazon Valley, came into
Ecuador, and Jameson, an Englishman resident in Ecuador, sent
many grasses to England. The late Prof. Luis Sodiro, of Quito,
sent many plants to Europe and described some himself. Padre
Luis Mille, of Quito, now has the care of Sodiro’s herbarium.
Father Mille very kindly allowed me to examine this herbarium,
which contains the types of species described by Sodiro. Father
BOTANICAL TRIP—HITCHCOCK 851

Mille is continuing the work of Sodiro in the study of the Ecua-
dorian flora.

Our knowledge of the flora of Peru has been greatly enlarged by
the work of Dr. A. Weberbauer, a German botanist long resident
in Peru and now living in Lima. Doctor Weberbauer is known not
only by the large number of plants he has collected and sent to
European herbaria but also by his great work on the distribution
of plants in the Peruvian Andes (Die Pflanzenwelt der peruanischen
Anden) and his phytogeographical map of the region (Mapa Fito-
geographico de los Andes Peruanos).

Dr. Otto Buchtien’s work in Bolivia has been mentioned in a
preceding paragraph. Dr. H. H. Rusby, of Columbia University,
New York, has collected in the montafia of northern. Bolivia, and
Mr. Macbride and his assistants are now engaged in botanical ex-
ploration in Peru for the Field Museum of Chicago. There have
been other botanical explorers in the three countries under consider-
ation, but altogether the flora is less known than most other parts
of South America.

By PAut C. STANDLEY

[With 26 Plates]
INTRODUCTION

Central America is a paradise for the orchid hunter. According
to a recent estimate there have been reported from the whole globe
15,000 species of these curious and fascinating plants, and nearly
1,000 have been recorded from a single Central American country,
Costa Rica. From the other republics—Panama, Nicaragua, Sal-
vador, Honduras, and Guatemala—about the same number of addi-
tional species have been listed, and Mexico is known to possess at
least 500 more.

It has been the writer’s privilege to spend two recent winters in
Central America for the purpose of making botanical collections,
and during this period particular attention has been devoted to
orchids. Although many of the localities visited have been found
deficient in these plants, others, and above all the mountains of Costa
Rica, have furnished a rich harvest.

Central America was one of the first regions from which tropical
orchids were introduced into the hothouses of Europe. Some of the
more striking Mexican: species had been described and figured in the
celebrated Z'hesaurus published by Hernandez in 1651, the first work
treating of the natural history of tropical North America, but
nothing was made known concerning the flora of Central America
until a much later date. Probably the first botanical collector
to visit Central America was Luis Née, a Frenchman by birth,
botanist of the celebrated Spanish voyage around the world under
the navigator Malaspina during the years 1789 to 1794. Née visited
Panama, and is known to have collected plants upon Ancon Hill,
the landmark of the Pacific end of the Canal. Several of the most
common tropical American plants were first described from speci-
mens obtained by him at this locality.

Tt was not until after the first quarter of the nineteenth century
that any botanical work of importance was carried on in Central
‘America, or any progress made toward a knowledge of the orchids.
353
354 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

George Ure Skinner, an Englishman who resided for many years in
Guatemala, beginning in 1831, is said to have introduced into culti-
vation in England nearly 100 species of orchids, a large number for
that day, when orchid culture in Europe was still in its infancy.
The famous Danish collector and botanist, Oersted, was the first to
visit (1846-1848) Costa Rica, where he collected some of the most
beautiful of all our American orchids. An extended visit to many
parts of Central America, including the rich regions of Guatemala,
Costa Rica, and Veraguas, was begun in 1846 by Warscewicz, who
traveled in search of orchids and hummingbirds, certainly a choice
of interests in which he was to be envied. Warscewicz discovered
many of the showy Central American representatives of this group.
Other botanists who took an important part in the early exploration
of Central America were Berthold Seemann, of the Herald expedi-
tion, who first made extensive collections in Panama; Tate in Nica-
ragua; Fendler (famous as the first to make a collection of any im-
portance in the State of New Mexico) in Panama; Hoffmann and
Wendland in Costa Rica; and Hayes and Wagner in Panama. In
addition, Central America was visited by commercial collectors sent
from Europe in search of orchids, palms, cacti, and other plants of
horticultural value, and at times the export of living orchid plants to
Europe by native collectors was a thriving industry. Thus, many
dozens of persons whose names have not been preserved aided in ac-
cumulating our present knowledge of the orchid flora.

It is during the past thirty years, however, that the most im-
portant botanical work has been carried on in Central America. In
Costa Rica large collections of orchids have been made by Tonduz,
Pittier, Werckle, Brenes, Jiménez, the Brade brothers, and others.
The orchid flora of Panama has been well explored by Powell, and in
Guatemala extensive collections have been made by von Tuerck-
heim, especially in Verapaz. Several collectors from the United
States have visited Central America, and have accumulated large
quantities of plants, although few have devoted special attention to
orchids. During the past fifteen years hundreds of new species of
Central American orchids have been described, mostly from Pana-
ma, Costa Rica, and Guatemala. These three Republics and Sal-
vador are those whose floras are best known. Of Honduras and Nic-
aragua, both of which doubtless will furnish a large number of or-
chid species, we still know very little, for scant exploration has been
conducted there, owing largely to difficulties of transportation.

In view of the great amount of botanical exploration that has been
carried on in Central America it might be questioned whether it is
necessary to make further visits to a region of such comparatively
small area. There is no doubt, however, that our knowledge of the

ORCHID COLLECTING—STANDLEY 355

Central American flora is still very imperfect, and that many years
more of intensive exploration are necessary. At present it is pos-
sible to obtain new plants even in the localities most often visited,
and it frequently results that conspicuous and important plants, well
known locally, are unknown to science. In the case of orchids,
because of their peculiar distribution and mode of growth, the need
for additional exploration is greater than in the case of most other
groups of plants, and it is certain that the number of orchids known
to exist in Central America will be greatly increased, perhaps even
doubled, in future years.

ORCHIDS OF NORTHERN CENTRAL AMERICA

The portion of Central America with which the writer is most
familiar, aside from the Canal Zone, is the Republic of Salvador,
where five months were spent in 1921-22. Salvador unfortunately
has few orchids, and only about 50 species are known there, most of
these having been collected by Dr. Salvador Calder6n and the writer.
Salvador undoubtedly has a smaller orchid flora than any other
Central American country, because its climate is comparatively dry
and the country lies wholly upon the Pacific slope, the Atlantic slope
being richer in these plants. Future exploration in small areas of
forest remaining upon the higher volcanoes will doubtless reveal a
good many additions to the list now known.

Of the Salvadorean orchids the handsomest is Cattleya skinneri,
widely distributed in Central America, a showy species (pl. 20),
known here as San Sebastian. During the dry season, when the
trees upon which they grow are nearly or quite devoid of leaves,
the huge plants covered with flowers are conspicuous masses of color.
Bunches of the flowers are brought frequently to the markets for
sale. Some fine plants of another striking orchid, H'pidendrwm
aurantiacum, notable for its clusters of orange blossoms, were seen
in the mountains about Ahuachapan. In the same mountain range
vanilla grows in some abundance, and doubtless occurs in other
regions as well.

In late spring of 1922 several weeks were spent upon the north
coast of Guatemala, near the famous Maya city of Quirigua. This
area belongs to the wet coastal belt, and has an altitude of only a
few hundred feet above sea level. Because of this slight elevation,
comparatively few orchids occur here, and at this season of the year
still fewer were in flower. Still, here and there upon the trees,
especially in deep swamps, which are filled with giant trees and
tangled thickets of native bamboo, there were found a few orchids
worth collecting, certainly more than it would be possible to find
in any single locality in Salvador.
856 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Next to Costa Rica, Guatemala is the Central American country
which has yielded most orchids, about 340 species being reported.
Of all the Central American States, Guatemala has the greatest
diversity of topography, elevation, and climate, and consequently
the most varied flora, although the actual number of species may not
be so high as in Costa Rica. For orchids, the most productive por-
tions are the humid valleys of the departments of Alta and Baja
Verapaz. Many of the mountain ranges have a temperate climate,
too cold for the best development of these plants, and there are
many miles of pine forest, where few orchids may be expected. There
are also wide cactus deserts, closely resembling those of northern
Mexico, where very few orchids grow.

Guatemala counts among its orchid species many that are noted
for their beauty. Most remarkable is a Cattleya (C. aurantiaca)
with orange-red fiowers, which grows upon rocks and bald-cypress
trees (Taxodium mucronatum) at high altitudes.

Of the orchids of Honduras and Nicaragua, as already stated,
little is known. From Nicaragua 65 species have been reported, and
from Honduras about the same number. Both countries have moun-
tain ranges and humid forests, in which many orchids must await the
discoverer. The scant information available concerning the Nicara-
guan flora reveals so many plants of exceptional interest, that it is
certain the country will later yield many other things equally
remarkable. The most inviting and tantalizing view, botanically,
that I have ever seen in Central America is that obtained in Salvador
of the blue mountain wall that lies to the north along the Honduran
frontier, near at hand yet almost inaccessible. Nothing is known of
its flora, but it must harbor a host of strange plants. Along the
Atlantic coast of Honduras a large collection of orchids was made
recently by Mr. Oakes Ames, but no account of it has yet been pub-
lished.

ORCHID COLLECTING IN PANAMA

In Panama the writer is acquainted only with the Canal Zone and
its immediate vicinity, a region typical of the lowland or tierra
caliente of both the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of Central America.
Although only 40 miles in breadth, the Isthmus at its narrowest
point exhibits an unexpected diversity of physical and floral char-
acters, because there is a strongly marked difference between the
climates of the two coasts. It is thus possible to study in the closest
proximity areas of vegetation typical of the humid Atlantic coast
and of the comparatively arid Pacific littoral, the latter with its
well-defined wet and dry seasons.

In the Canal Zone the highest hills have an elevation of about
500 feet. Toward both the west and east in the Republic the hills

ORCHID COLLECTING—STANDLEY 357

rise rapidly until high mountains are soon reached, but unfortu-
nately none of these are easily accessible from the Zone. Near the
Canal most of the land has been deforested and the original vegeta-
tion greatly modified, but even within the Zone there remain some
areas of nearly or quite virgin forest, within which it is possible to
study the primeval vegetation. In the dense and humid forests,
composed of lofty trees with but scant undergrowth, careful search
will disclose a fair number of orchids.

After the Canal had been completed and water was turned into
the Gatun Lake Basin, as the water rose large stretches of forest
were inundated and the trees soon died. Great expanses of the lake
waters are still covered with protruding dead tree tops, which give
a decidedly dreary and unattractive aspect to the landscape. After
the trees died the epiphytic plants continued to grow, and were
much more conspicuous than before. Among the dead branches
there was an abundance of orchids, and it was easy to collect them
from a boat. Practically all the orchid plants have now been re-
moved, however, and little of interest is to be found in these areas.

The lowland forests of the Canal Zone are typical of many other
regions throughout Central America. Such forests are not the
most favorable localities in which to search for orchids, since these
plants attain their best development at much higher altitudes. On
the Atlantic slope the lack of elevation is somewhat compensated
for by the excessive moisture, a plentiful supply of water being one
of the chief requirements for luxuriant orchid growth.

When during early construction days Americans began to arrive
in the Canal Zone, the great majority of them unfamiliar with trop-
ical conditions, even the least interested could scarcely fail to take
notice of the more conspicuous plants, which were quite unlike any-
thing known to one reared in the temperate zone. Orchids, being as
universally associated with conventional conceptions of tropical
regions as parrots and monkeys, naturally drew their share of atten-
tion, and many temporary residents in the Zone made small collec-
tions of them. Without helpful literature upon the subject, and
without any person able to furnish information concerning the
plants, it was impossible to do more than assemble these amateur
collections in the most haphazard way, and little or nothing was
added to the recorded scientific information regarding the orchid
flora of Panama. When their owners returned to the States, the col-
lections were usually left behind and the plants died for lack of care.
The most notable of these local collections of construction days were
those assembled by Mrs. D. D. Gaillard and Mrs. H. H. Rousseau,
_ both of which were of considerable size and included many interest-
‘ing plants. When Mr. Henry Pittier visited the Canal Zone in
358 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

1910-11 he obtained from these two collections specimens which were
found to represent species previously unknown to science.

At the present time, passing along the streets of the Canal Zone
towns, one notices upon porches or hanging in baskets from near-by
trees many orchid plants that are kept for their oddity or their hand-
some flowers. They belong to a small number of well-known species,
the botanically more interesting but inconspicuous plants being nat-
urally without interest for the amateur. It may be noted here that
in horticultural circles in England and elsewhere a more or less
sharp line is drawn between “ orchids ”—that is, those with showy or
odd flowers, worthy of cultivation—and “botanical orchids,” which
are of interest only to the technical botanist.

To Warscewicz we owe the greater part of the earlier data re-
garding Panama orchids. He devoted a good deal of time to the ex-
ploration of Chiriquf, the region richest in these plants, and probably
the most interesting part of Panama for the botanist. In the Canal
Zone plants have been gathered by many collectors. Seemann, in
1852, published the first list of Panama orchids, enumerating 104
species. During the progress of the Smithsonian Biological Survey
of the Canal Zone in 1910-11, a large collection of the group was ob-
tained by Pittier and Maxon, not only near the Canal but in Chiriqui
and in other parts of Panama not visited previously by collectors.

THE POWELL ORCHID GARDEN IN PANAMA.

The major part of our knowledge of the orchids of the Republic
of Panama is due to the interest of one man, the result of whose
labor is a striking illustration of what may be accomplished by one
who has a hobby and follows it intelligently. Mr. C. W. Powell has
lived in the Canal Zone since earliest construction days. A man of
exceptional breadth of interests, he has always taken a keen interest
in general matters relating to natural history, and even in the earli-
est days he took more than casual notice of the orchids seen in trips
through the jungles. From time to time he formed small collections
of living plants, some of which he presented to friends, while others
were lost by accident. He often laments the fact that he was not
then interested in technical classification of the plants, since in the
early days, before the forests had been scoured by other collectors
and before the virgin forest had been cut, there were doubtless
many species that are now extinct and will never be known to
science.

About 10 years ago Mr. Powell became seriously interested in
orchids, and determined to assemble a complete collection of Panama
species. Unfamiliar with the literature and without relations with
specialists upon the group, his work was attended by difficulties, but

ORCHID COLLECTING—-STANDLEY 359

he assembled living plants in his garden and formed a good library
of publications upon orchids. Study of this literature indicated
that he had many plants not described in current works. Finally
correspondence was established with the English orchidologist,
Rolfe, and there was prepared for his study a series of herbarium
specimens of the plants as they bloomed; but Rolfe died soon after-
ward, without having had an opportunity to study the collection.
Still later another herbarium collection was prepared, and entrusted
for determination to the well-known orchidologist, Schlechter, of
Berlin, who published in 1922 a pamphlet of 95 pages enumerating
the Powell orchids, which consisted of 184 species, no less than 75
of which were described as new to science.

In more recent years Mr. Powell has forwarded his collection for
identification to Mr. Oakes Ames, the most eminent American
authority upon this difficult group, and the number of species has
increased, until now it amounts to 341. There can scarcely be for
any tropical country a record of one person who has contributed so
much to the knowledge of the orchid flora, or who has assembled so
complete a representation of the group.

The quality of the herbarium specimens prepared by Mr. Powell
deserves more than passing mention. Years of experience, through
which the best methods have been discovered, combined with at-
tention to details such as other collectors rarely attain, have enabled
him to make specimens which are unsurpassed. The color of the
flowers is kept perfectly in most cases, and the whole plant pre-
serves its natural aspect. Such results are the more remarkable
with a group in which it is extremely difficult to make satisfactory
specimens, the plants often having fleshy parts that yield up their
moisture only after stubborn resistance. It is very largely because
of the difficulty of preparing good specimens that so comparatively
small a number of orchids have been collected in explored portions
of Central America, a neglect that has extended to many other
eroups of monocotyledonous plants of a similar nature. It is only
by the use of artificial heat that good herbarium specimens of
orchids and other fleshy plants can be prepared in tropical regions.

The Powell orchid garden at Balboa is one of the most interest-
ing sights of the Canal Zone, and botanically by far the most re-
markable thing to be seen there. It is something unique in tropical
America, if not in the whole world.

The garden, situated on the lower slopes of Ancon Hill, is sur-
rounded by a wire-netting fence 8 feet high, covered with vines,
and the same netting with its curtain of vines continues overhead.
Various climbing plants are used for covering the netting, and by
_pruning them from time to time the optimum amount of shade or
sunlight is obtained.
360 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

There are now growing in the garden over 7,000 orchid plants,
representing about 400 species. Among these are many that have
never flowered, and will, when they blossom, furnish other species
records for Panama. Nearly all the plants are from Panama, the
only exceptions being some from other parts of tropical America
and a few from the Old World, which are grown for their handsome
flowers. The garden is a show place in Balboa, visited by many
tourists. Most orchids bloom for only a short period, but there
are always some in flower at any season of the year. Here in
Panama, as in all tropical regions, the great majority of orchids,
contrary to ill-informed popular belief, are plants with incon-
spicuous flowers, without interest to the casual observer. It is true
that most of these small flowers, even the tiniest, are strikingly hand-
some when viewed under a lens. Visitors about to inspect an orchid
garden generally anticipate lavish displays of brilliant color, and
are sometimes disappointed when faced with actualities, since even
in so large an assemblage of orchid plants, and at the most favor-
able season, the percentage of plants with showy flowers is surpris-
ingly small. For this reason it is desirable to cultivate some exotic
plants which can be depended upon to furnish quantities of showy
flowers, and thus satisfy those visitors who are interested more in
the superficial aspects of the collection than in its true scientific value.

In order to accommodate the large variety of orchids occurring
naturally in Panama it is necessary to supply varied conditions for
their growth. Tropical orchids are divided into two classes, terres-
trial and epiphytic. The former grow in the ground, and in the
Tropics these are far less numerous than the epiphytic species. Of
terrestrial orchids there are two classes—those with green leaves and
stems, which behave lke most other plants, and those which are
saprophytic, living wholly upon decaying plant matter. Saprophy-
tic orchids, which are not numerous anywhere, are easily recognized
by their lack of green coloration.

By far the greater number of tropical orchids are epiphytic,
growing upon trunks or limbs of trees, and deriving nutriment
chiefly from decaying organic material that lodges about their
roots. They are often spoken of as parasites, but no orchids are
parasites, our only common representatives of that group being the
mistletoes. Epiphytic orchids are sometimes apparently terrestrial,
growing upon the ground in beds of mosses and other plants.

In temperate regions all orchids are terrestrial. In the United
States epiphytic species are found only in Florida, except for a
few that extend farther west close to the Gulf coast. Florida has
a rather large number of epiphytic species, belonging to groups
that are represented also in Central America. It is worthy of
record here that in an orchid list published recently by Ames, about
ORCHID COLLECTING—STANDLEY 361

150 species of orchids are reported for the United States and Can-
ada. Contrary to popular belief, orchids of temperate regions prob-
ably average quite as showy as those of the tropics. Few of the
latter are more attractive than some of our northern species of
Cypripedium or lady’s-slipper.

It must not be assumed that all epiphytic plants are orchids, as is
sometimes carelessly done by residents in the Tropics, just as in cac-
tus regions all plants with spines are likely to be known popularly
as cactuses. In warm countries a great number of plants of many
widely separated groups assume the epiphytic habit. In tropical
America the most noteworthy of these, and those most frequently
referred to erroneously as orchids, are bromeliads, or plants of the
pineapple family, many of which have exceptionally showy flowers,
quite as ornamental as most orchids.

In the Powell garden most of the plants, naturally, are epiphytes.
These are grown in baskets filled with sphagnum or upon blocks of
wood, suspended from overhead. There is also at one end of the
garden a large mango tree upon which a great variety of species
have taken root, affording a picture of natural conditions. In the
more sunny portion beds are provided for the terrestrial species,
which are represented in large numbers. Many epiphytic species,
too, prefer a good deal of sunshine, especially the larger, coarser
plants. For very small and delicate plants which come originally
from wet forests deep shade must be provided. Climatic conditions
are favorable in the Canal Zone for orchid cultivation, at least for
those species which occur naturally at low elevations. During the
summer or rainy season there is a plentiful supply of moisture, too
much at times. During the winter months, which constitute the
dry season, it is necessary to water the plants daily. Even at so low
an altitude, sea level, it has been found practicable to grow most of
the montane species brought from the forests of Chiriqui, provided
good care is taken of them. There are, of course, insect enemies to
be fought—cockroaches, which eat the tender flower buds, and other
similar pests that visit the garden, especially at night, and some-
times ruin the blossoms of the most cherished plants whose flowers
have been awaited for years. Birds sometimes cause equal harm.

Almost all the orchids known to occur in the whole Republic of
Panama may be seen and studied in this garden under the most
favorable conditions. For the past ten years Mr. Powell, very often
in company, with Mr. A. A. Hunter, has conducted systematic ex-
ploration in many parts of the country, visiting distant localities,
especially the high mountains of Chiriqui. Sometimes the plants are
found in full flower in the field, but more often they are not. The
living plants are then brought to the garden, where they are care-
fully tended until they flower, when specimens can be made for study

e
362 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

by specialists. It is only the continued cultivation of the plants
in the garden that has made it possible to establish such a record
as to the number of Panama species.

Aside from the material gathered upon these expeditions, one or
more native collectors have been employed for much of the time.
One of these men, a West Indian, himself has become almost an
expert upon the native orchids, having made many journeys into
the jungle after them and having cared for them in the garden.

Collecting orchids in Panama is not the easy task that it is in
Costa Rica, where conditions are more favorable in every respect.
Except in the immediate vicinity of the Canal, transportation is
difficult. Even here it is usually necessary for the collector to make
his way over trails that are negotiable only on foot, or more fre-
quently through regions where there are no trails at all, and it is
no easy matter to force one’s way through a lowland tropical jungle.
Moreover, in the present lowland forests orchids are not plentiful
as to either individuals or species. It may be that extended collec-
tion has made them scarcer about the Zone, but it seems doubtful
that, with the exception of such specially favorable localities as the
original Gatun basin, the plants ever were much more plentiful than
now. One can travel a long time through the forests along the
Canal without seeing any orchids at all, and when some are found
they are likely to be perched high on the branches of some giant
tree, whence they can be obtained only by felling the tree, which
often requires the services of a couple of men for a whole day
or more. Even when the tree is felled, the orchids so laboriously
obtained may prove worthless. The smaller and more interesting
plants can not be seen from the ground, for they grow mostly upon
the upper side of the branches and are hidden among other vegeta-
tion. Even when a tree can be climbed, usually it is so infested with
biting ants or other insects that only by submitting to torture, if
even then, is it possible to remain aloft long enough to secure speci-
mens. In Costa Rica one can collect in a single afternoon more
orchids than in a whole month in the lowlands of Panama.

COMMON ORCHIDS OF PANAMA

The Panama orchid flora includes a host of showy and interesting
species. It is curious that one Old World species seems to have be-
come naturalized. Some years ago Mr. Powell purchased a plant,
new to him, from a collector who claimed to have found it in a
swamp in the Zone. Upon flowering it was determined as Phaius
tancarvilleae, a Chinese species. The same plant has become thor-
oughly naturalized in Jamaica. It is sometimes cultivated for
ornament, and probably had escaped from previous cultivation in
Panama as in Jamaica.

ORCHID COLLECTING—STANDLEY 363

Most celebrated among Panama orchids is doubtless the /spiritu
Santo, Holy Ghost or dove orchid (Peristeria elata), that often
figures upon local illustrated post cards. This plant, which occurs
also in Costa Rica, is terrestrial and inhabits the lowland forests.
It has been collected so much as now to be rather rare about the
Zone. From a cluster of green bulbs rise a few narrow leaves, and
a flower stalk 3 or 4 feet high which bears a raceme of fragrant
waxy-white flowers about 2 inches broad. The organs in the center
of the flower show a striking resemblance to a miniature dove with
spread tail and outstretched wings, the head and bill also being
perfectly reproduced. It may be imagined in what veneration and
esteem such a flower is held by the native people.

In Cattleyas Panama is not fortunate, for only one has been col-
lected, Cattleya deckeri (pl. 3, fig. 1), a species related to C. skinnert
discussed elsewhere, and apparently rare. Mr. Powell, however, has
in cultivation some handsome exotic Cattleyas, particularly fine
plants of Cattleya trianaei, a Colombian species, and one of those
most frequently seen in cultivation in the United States.

A peculiarly characteristic Panama plant is Brassavola nodosa
(pl. 4), which is found nevertheless in many other parts of Central
America, northern South America, and even in Jamaica. It grows
upon both trees and rocks. The curious thick, stiff leaves are nearly
round, but are channeled along the upper side. The delightfully
fragrant flowers, 2 to 3 inches long, have greenish sepals and petals
and a pure white lip. This is common in the lowlands of Panama,
and is one of the few orchids that is plentiful on Taboga Island.
A laudable but unsuccessful campaign was once conducted with the
purpose of establishing it as the national flower of Panama.

Among the most showy of the local orchids are the species of
Oncidium, commonly known as butterfly orchids, a fitting name,
since the numerous widespread blossoms, golden yellow and often
mottled with brown and red, suggest a cloud of butterflies hovering
over the plant. The one here illustrated (pl. 5), Oncidium powellit,
is known only from Panama, and is one of the host of Panama
orchids that appropriately bear the name of the man who has done
most toward making them known. The Oncidiums constitute one
of the largest orchid groups, about 530 species having been described,
all American. They are frequently cultivated in the north and are
excellent as cut flowers. In Panama there are numerous species
occurring at all elevations. They are abundant locally about the
Zone, and someone told me of having seen a year or two ago a swamp
near the Atlantic coast where the plants in full blossom abounded
to such an extent that their golden color dominated the landscape.
In certain species of Oncidium the flower sprays in age reach a
length of 10 to 15 feet.
364 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Somewhat suggestive of the Brassavolas is Brassia longissima
(pl. 6, fig. 1), another lowland species. The flowers are greenish
with a yellowish tinge, the lip dotted with purple. The plant is
curious because of the unusual elongation of the sepals, these often
attaining a length of 7 to 8 inches.

Chondrorrhyncha lipscombiae (pl. 26, fig. 1) is an attractive plant,
suggesting the Trichopilias that are so common in Costa Rica. It is
a species known only from Gatun Lake. The flowers are white, with
a lavender band around the edge of the lip.

Plates 7, 8, and 9 show several Panama species of Epidendrum.
This is the largest genus of American orchids, and is confined to the
Western Hemisphere. About 750 species have been described, some
of them ranging as far north as Florida. There are many species in
Panama, and they exhibit great diversity in the form and color of
their flowers. Epidendrum atropurpureum (pl. 7, fig. 1) is a coarse
plant with rather few but large and showy flowers, the sepals and
petals being dark purplish and the lip white, with purplish lines in
the center. It is plentiful on the dry Pacific slope of Costa Rica, and
blossoms during the dry season. I have seen handsome color vari-
eties of it also in Salvador.

Several species of Mormodes are found in Panama. The ones
illustrated (pl. 10, pl. 11, fig. 1) have brown flowers of thick texture
and striking appearance, remarkable more for their oddity than their
beauty. These plants are noteworthy for the fact that they shed
their leaves during the dry season, at which time the flowers are
produced.

The same habit prevails in a related genus, Catasetum (pl. 11, fig.
2, pl. 12). The species illustrated is a rather attractive plant, with
ereenish white, fragrant flowers. In this group there are two kinds
of flowers, staminate and pistillate (sometimes termed male and
female), of quite different appearance. In Cycnoches (pls. 13, 14),
too, flowers of two sexes, unlike in appearance, are produced. The
sepals commonly are green or greenish, and the lip white. These
plants, like those of related genera, are frequently or usually devoid
of leaves at time of flowering.

In the case of many of these orchids that have large bulbs
(pseudobulbs), organs for storage of moisture, and are leafless
when the flowers are unfolded, the bulbs are hollow, at least with
age, and inhabited by colonies of characteristic ants that bite
severely when the plant is molested. For this reason it is far from
pleasant to collect them. The function of the ants is not well under-
stood. Certainly they are not necessary to the growth of the plant,
for Mr. Powell states that when preparing plants for the garden,
the ants are always removed, notwithstanding which the plants con-
tinue to grow luxuriantly.

ORCHID COLLECTING—STANDLEY 865

A similar case of symbiosis occurs in the case of the species of
Coryanthes (pl. 6, fig. 2), which are sometimes called bucket orchids,
because of the curious form of their flowers. The species figured,
which grows on the hills back of Panama City, has clear yellow
flowers, which exhibit most remarkable modifications during the
process of fertilization. In Coryanthes the huge masses of roots
are inhabited by innumerable small ants that are among the fiercest
of those found in Panama. So disagreeable is the process of collec-
tion that it is almost impossible to obtain the plants, it being stated
that the only practical method is to pull the masses from the tree
with a rope, then drag them by the rope to a stream, where they may
be immersed until the ants have departed. Many similar cases of
symbiosis between ants and orchids exist in Central America. The
same conditions occur also in numerous other groups of unrelated
tropical plants, some of which have special organs for the accom-
modation of their inhabitants.

Among the vines that cover the trellises in the Powell garden are
various plants of Vanilla, of which there are two common species
in Panama, V. planifolia (pls. 16, 17) with narrow leaves and V.
pompona with wide leaves. There are several other species of
Vanilla in Central America. All are vines which climb high in the
trees by means of aerial rootlets, but also root in the ground. The
plants are usually plentiful in the lowland forests, and are found
almost everywhere about the Canal Zone.

Vanilla is the only orchid with any important economic appli-
cation. Although so common wild in Central America, it is not
grown upon a commercial scale, unless it be in Guatemala, but it is
often planted in gardens as a curiosity. The commercial article is
obtained chiefly from Mexico, Tahiti, and the East Indies, but some
of the vanilla upon the market is an artificial synthetic preparation.
The flowers of Vanilla are rather showy. The natural commercial
substance is obtained from the seed pods. When these are dried the
vanillin, the aromatic principle, crystallizes on the outside of the pod.

One of the most remarkable of Panama orchids is Selenipedium
chica, discovered in the mountains many years ago by Duchassaing,
who reported that the seed pods yielded a flavoring substance
similar to vanilla. It was only a few years ago that this species
was rediscovered, by Mr. Ellsworth P. Killip, upon Ancon Hill,
where, however, it is no longer to be found. The plant reaches a
height of 15 feet, and is said by Ames to be the tallest orchid known.
The flowers are not very conspicuous, but somewhat resemble those
of the lady’s-slipper of the United States.

Among the finest of the orchids cultivated by Mr. Powell are sev-
eral species of Sobralia (pl. 2, fig. 2). They are terrestrial plants,
usually forming dense clumps containing numerous stems. The large
366 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

flowers are mostly rose or purple, but in some species white, and all
are very showy. Some of the species flower almost throughout the
year, but the habit of flowering is peculiar. All over a large clump
of plants the flowers open, one on each stalk, on a certain morning.
They remain open for only a few hours, then close, and fall from
the plant unless they have been fertilized. After several days there
is another crop of blossoms, but meanwhile not a single flower will
have been seen upon the colony.

Worthy of mention because of their oddity are the species of
Ornithocephalus, which are not uncommon in both Panama and
Costa Rica (pl. 18). The flowers are minute, greenish yellow, and
in form bear some resemblance to a bird’s head, hence the generic
name. The plant is fan-shaped, the leaves being flat and all in one
plane, resembling in this respect iris leaves. This fan-shaped ar-
rangement of leaves is found in various other Panama orchids, nota-
bly in a diminutive Oncidium that is abundant upon cacao branches
at Las Cascadas Plantation. In this the leaves are often not more
than half an inch in length, while the flowers, of which there is
sometimes only one, are frequently much larger than the plant
proper. This is unusual among orchids, since ordinarily small plants
have the smallest flowers.

To list all the orchids of Panama or only the more important ones
would far exceed the limits of this paper, and would serve no useful
purpose, since it would merely furnish a list of uninteresting Latin
names. In fact, very few orchids have distinctive English names,
and even among gardeners it is the custom to refer to the plants
by their generic names, which after all is the only means by which
accuracy in plant names may be attained. Photographs give
little idea of the modifications exhibited by the flowers, but exami-
nation of the plants themselves when in flower is a different matter,
for then almost anyone is interested in observing the unbelievable
variety presented, a variation in form and coloration not equaled in
any other family of plants.

In spite of the great diversity exhibited by orchid flowers, it must
be stated that this results only from the modification of organs which
are common to other groups of plants. The flower consists of three
sepals and three petals, one of the latter being normally very dif-
ferent from the other two and called the lip or labellum. The three
stamens, of which one or two are abortive, are united with the pistil
to form a column, which also is often specially modified.

ORCHID COLLECTING IN COSTA RICA

Really to see orchids one must go to Costa Rica, where they
almost fill the rdle of weeds. After becoming familiar with the
profusion of orchids, as to both individuals and species, that exists
ORCHID COLLECTING—STANDLEY 867

here in localities easily accessible, it seems a waste of time to go
elsewhere when looking for orchids. Costa Rica possesses many
attractive features that make botanical work agreeable, and the
expenditure of but little labor yields rich results. The country
is easy of access and transportation facilities are comparatively
adequate, although not so good as in Salvador; the climate in
general is delightful, in many regions temperate rather than tropi-
cal; and the people, as the writer can testify from personal ex-
perience, pleasant and hospitable to the highest degree. It is a
remarkable testimonial to the physical features, government, people,
and social conditions of Costa Rica, that whenever an inhabitant
of any other Central American state is asked what is the best part
of Central America, the answer is almost always if not universally
Costa Rica, even in the case of people who have never seen the
country. Such is the reputation which Costa Rica enjoys among
its neighbors who, after all, are the most competent judges.

Costa Rica has approximately the area of the State of West
Virginia, and like that State is preeminently mountainous. To
prove the botanical richness of Costa Rica, it is necessary only to
state that its known flora includes about 6,000 species of flowering
plants and ferns. This number will be greatly increased, for in
spite of the vast amount of collecting that has been done, over a
long period of years, there are whole mountain ranges of whose
vegetation practically nothing has been ascertained. When it is
remembered that in the United States and Canada there are only
about 16,000 species of plants, and that the United States has 130
times the area of Costa Rica, some idea of the richness of the
Costa Rican flora may be formed.

There is probably no other part of all North America of equal
extent that can approach Costa Rica in wealth of species, and there
is certainly no other region of the continent where so many orchids
grow. Scarcely any orchids have been collected thus far in the
Cordillera of Talamanca, the most extensive mountain chain and the
one containing the loftiest peaks. This area is difficult of access
and has hardly been touched by the botanist, although it is likely
to prove the most remunerative part of the Republic.

The writer’s experiences with orchids in Costa Rica were confined
to a few localities that it was possible to visit in two months. These
included typical regions of the Atlantic coastal plain, about La
Colombiana and Guapiles; numerous localities in the northern
Cordillera and in the highlands about San José, the capital; and a
single visit to the comparatively dry Pacific coast. At all these
places orchids were found in greater or less profusion. Some were
in- flower, but many more had neither flowers nor seed pods. AI-
though the visit was made during the dry winter months, it seems
368 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

unlikely that at any other time of year it would be possible to find
a greater proportion of the plants in blossom. At any season some
orchids are in bloom, but each species probably has a more or less
well defined flowering period, and in order to obtain the complete
orchid flora of a locality it would be necessary to visit it every month
in the year. Some remain in flower only a few days, while with
others the blooming period is greatly prolonged.

PACIFIC SLOPE

So little time was spent upon the Pacific coast, near Orotina, that
it is impossible to make any generalizations of value. It may be
stated definitely, however, that the whole flora here is far less varied
than elsewhere in Costa Rica, and that in a day’s collecting one can
find only a fraction of the number of plants to be obtained in other
parts of Costa Rica in the same length of time. Moreover, the
plants are less interesting and consist chiefly of species having a
wide distribution in tropical America. Most of the land is now un-
forested. Where forests do occur they are moderately dense and
consist of a limited number of species, many of which lose their
leaves in the dry season. In the heavier forest the undergrowth is
little varied and lacks many of the conspicuous plants of the Atlantic
coast. Ferns are very few, and the species mostly uninteresting.
These conditions must be understood as prevailing only at lower
altitudes, on the hills and in the plains near the coast. Upon the
mountains of the Pacific coastal region conditions are more favor-
able.

About Orotina orchids were rather plentiful as to individuals,
but appeared to represent only a few species. Not many were in
flower during the dry season. Most conspicuous was L'pidendrum
atropurpureum (pl. 7, fig. 1). In the forests the orchids are confined
mostly to the upper branches of the trees, where it is difficult or
impossible to collect them. On some of the small trees scattered
about the fields and pastures the case is different. It is a well
attested fact that certain species of trees are preferred by orchids,
and that there are others upon which they never grow. The favorite
tree of all is probably the calabash (Crescentia cujete), which is
seldom without its quota of orchid epiphytes and often is almost
completely covered with them. The mango, strangely enough, is
another favorite tree for certain species. About the Canal Zone,
where mangoes have run wild through the forests, there is almost
always a goodly number of orchid plants upon them. Wild figs,
on the other hand, are usually almost or quite free of epiphytes. In
general, it seems that smooth-barked trees are little frequented by
orchids, although the smoothness of the bark scarcely seems an ade-
ORCHID COLLECTING—STANDLEY 369

quate explanation for this condition, since even the smoothest bark
has irregularities sufficient for the lodgment of orchid and other
seeds.

ATLANTIC COAST

Over on the Atlantic coast of Costa Rica climatic conditions are
very different from those prevailing along the Pacific watershed.
Here, although there is some differentiation into dry and wet sea-
sons, there is a copious supply of moisture throughout the year.
Even in what may be termed the dry season there are frequent
heavy rains, so that at all times of the year the atmosphere is satur-
ated. Such a condition, associated with a high temperature, affords
ideal conditions for the development of truly tropical vegetation,
which attains a luxuriance unknown in temperate lands.

The lowlands of the Atlantic coast are characterized by heavy
forests, naturally more or less like those of near-by Panama, but
here there remain vast stretches still untouched by man. The only
breaks in the dense forests that cover this part of Costa Rica are
the extensive banana plantations, for which the region is famous,
and small patches cleared for cultivation of other fruits and of
vegetables.

Such forests as these satisfy to the fullest extent one’s precon-
ceived notions of what a tropical forest ought to be. The covering
of the tree tops is so dense that no sunshine reaches the ground.
Even the rain can not fall directly, and during a heavy shower one
may walk for miles without becoming wet. Very large trees, with
trunks six feet or more in diameter, are frequent, some of them with
fantastically buttressed or otherwise supported trunks. Certain
trees, notably the Cecropias, which have always seemed to the writer
the most characteristically tropical of all Central American trees,
are supported by prop-roots, similar in form to those developing in
maize. Large, woody vines are characteristic of these forests, and
coarse epiphytes, especially aroids and bromeliads. The ground also
is well covered nearly everywhere, mostly with large herbs, among
which ferns are usually conspicuous, as well as numerous sorts of
palms. Some of these plants have showy flowers, but more often the
blossoms are small and inconspicuous. In the heavy lowland forest
one may look in every direction and see no sign of color other than
the dull, dark, monotonous green that is characteristic of tropical
American forests, and quite different from the lighter and livelier
green of the forests of the United States.

There are a good many orchids in this part of Costa Rica, and there
must be many undescribed ones, for the region has been little visited
by botanists, chiefly because of a wholesome fear of malaria, which
is all too prevalent at,such elevations. In the case of other groups
370 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of plants it is certain that the flora is of the highest interest. Col-
lecting orchids here is attended with much the same difficulties as
upon the Pacific coast, for the plants perch upon the highest branches
where they can scarcely be reached. When one is so fortunate as to
find an area recently cleared, where the fallen trees have not yet
been burned, a large collection may be gathered in a short time.
Some of the orchids grow low upon the tree trunks, and can be
reached from the ground. It is not uncommon to find orchids
normally terrestrial that have here taken to growing upon tree
trunks.
HIGHLANDS OF CENTRAL COSTA RICA

It is to the mountains one must travel if large quantities of
orchids are to be seen, and there not even the least energetic collector
can fail to find them. Of all Costa Rica, the central uplands are the
most attractive part. The climate in many localities is ideal, and
the landscape sufficiently varied and pleasing to satisfy the most
fastidious visitor. All or nearly all the usual tropical insect and
other pests are left behind, and one may wander about with less dis-
comfort than in most parts of the United States. There are so many
beautiful places that it is impossible to determine which should head
the list. What can be lovelier than the Valley of Orosi, south of
Cartago; or Cartago itself, lying at the foot of the Volcano of
Irazti? Central America is rich in cities with beautiful sites, but
none of them can surpass the Costa Rican capital, San José.

This portion of Costa Rica has a temperate rather than a tropical
climate. Freezing temperatures are unknown, but upon the tops of
the high volcanoes frosts occur. In this temperate belt and just
below its lower limits, or even in the colder upper belts of the moun-
tains, orchids attain their greatest profusion. All this region was
once covered by dense humid forest, no doubt, but now large areas,
in fact the greater portion, have been cleared to make way for the
coffee fincas which furnish the chief wealth of the country. At still
higher altitudes the forest has been replaced by meadows over which
graze the herds of cattle that are the basis of a substantial industry
in milk, cheese, and butter, such as has been developed nowhere else
in Central America.

The abundance of material here available for study under such
exceptional physical conditions must arouse the enthusiasm of any
botanist. The variety of plants is so great that at first one is over-
whelmed, and can only wander about bewildered and unable to
fix attention upon any particular plant.

Only a few hours’ ride from San José over a good road brings one
to La Palma (pl. 19), a classic locality for Costa Rican plants, vis-
ited by almost every botanist who has worked in Costa Rica, yet -of
ORCHID COLLECTING—STANDLEY 871

such wealth that it is still far from exhausted. One rides at first
through comparatively level country, planted with coffee and groves
of fruit trees, then through fields of corn, until finally one reaches a
rather definite line at which there is evidence of a moister climate.
Beyond this point there are few cultivated fields, but instead pas-
tures full of cattle. Ia Palma lies in a gap between the volcanoes
of Barba and Irazt. The pass between these peaks has an altitude
of about 5,700 feet. Through this opening clouds pour from the
plains of Santa Clara, which stretch toward the Atlantic coast; they
lodge here and shed their rain. It is said that it is always raining
at La Palma. No matter how clear the day at San José, looking to-
ward La Palma one always sees low-hanging clouds. Riding along
the road one comes suddenly into this cloud zone, out of the sunshine
into a penetrating fog, with cold drizzling rain, and often an ac-
companiment of wind. At night this combination is dismal and un-
comfortable beyond description, and even in the day the effect is
dreary enough; yet the sun does shine sometimes at La Palma, and
then the scene is beautiful. The temperature is so low that one is
never comfortably warm. The meadows, mostly of imported grasses,
clovers, and other European plants, dotted with dandelicns, butter-
cups, and violets, are green throughout the year. The continuous
rainfall has saturated the meadows so that they are like sponges
soaked in icy water, into which one sinks at each step. There are
small rills on every side. About the meadows are banked dark
masses of trees, that also fill the uncleared ravines.

Clearing does not seem to have injured the flora; rather it has
probably improved it. Many plants, including some of the most
showy ones, do not reach their best development in deep forest,
but require a greater amount of light than is available there. These
have found a favorable environment at the forest edge. Many
orchids belong to this class; indeed, orchids generally, except some
of the smallest and most delicate, do not seem to thrive in heavy
forest, and in general orchid collecting gives better results at the
forest edge and on the isolated trees that dot the meadows.

‘Take any one of these trees or one of the old stumps, and examine
it at leisure. It will be found that each tree is a veritable flower
garden. Each has a flora different from that of its neighbor.
The best method of collecting is to take a small area and “ comb”
the trees, one by one. ‘There is no need to cover a large area;
ability to climb trees is the most important requirement. The trees
are small and gnarled, resembling old apple trees. They are of
many species, but often it is difficult to determine what the tree
itself really is, so nearly concealed is it under a burden of alien
vegetation. There are some true parasites here, mistletoes with
masses of yellow or red flowers, but most of the covering con-
372 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

sists of epiphytes, loose cushions and pendants of mosses and hepa-
tics, gray lichens, and masses of herbs and shrubs of the most
heterogeneous family relationship. Some of the invading shrubs
are nearly as large as the host itself. Many are noteworthy for
their gorgeous flowers, and if this were a tropical forest it really
would satisfy popular pictures of the Tropics. Usually yellow
fiowers predominate in any locality, but such is not the case here.
Although yellows are not absent, they are not so conspicuous, at
least in winter, as the reds supplied by innumerable plants of the
heath family. These furnish such an abundance of red as one
expects never to find in nature. Some of the lobelias are equally
showy, and there are also other plants with red blossoms. Blues
are as scarce as elsewhere, but there are many plants with attractive
white flowers.

On all these moss-covered trees there is an abundant supply of
ferns and, last but not least, of orchids. The profusion of orchids
is truly bewildering. Occasionally there is one with showy flowers,
but more often they are small plants, often only 1 or 2 inches
high, with miniature blossoms. Every branch bears a copious
supply of them, and the variety is infinite. If one spends the whole
day hunting them, at evening one will still be finding new forms.
Some species are plentiful and quickly recognized, but others are
so rare that one may search all day without finding a second plant.
When one realizes that in Costa Rica there are many hundreds of.
square miles of equally rich orchid territory, it will be under-
stood why it is that every new collector finds many novelties.

Well within the forest, which is always dripping wet, there are
many orchids and other plants upon the trees. The individual
plants are so entangled that there is difficulty in separating them.
Their roots are bedded in masses of decaying vegetable matter, and
when a clump is pulled down from above, a shower of débris falls
into one’s eyes. Some terrestrial orchids occur, but the species are
unimportant in comparison with the epiphytic ones.

All around La Palma there are many other favorable localities,
several of which were visited by the writer. At La Hondura, over
the pass from San José and on the Atlantic slope, the flora is almost
unbelievably varied and rich, and years of collecting will be in-
sufficient to exhaust it. The elevation at La Hondura is less than
at La Palma, but the precipitation is as great, and there can be no
better place in which to look for orchids.

It is interesting to see how remarkably the plants change from
one locality to another, even at a distance of only a few miles.
Plants that are abundant in one place may not be found at all at a
near-by locality, and this is frequently the case even with trees and
other large and important species. With orchids elevation seems to

ORCHID COLLECTING—STANDLEY 373

be a matter of great importance. There is apparently an optimum
elevation at which they reach their best development. For the La
Palma region this must be at about 6,000 feet. At another locality
only a very few miles away, but of slightly greater elevation, orchids
were found to be far less plentiful, although the other vegetation
was luxuriant and attractively varied.

At higher elevations the scarcity of orchids is still more pro-
nounced. Upon the upper slopes of the Volcano of Pods, one of
the most remarkable natural monuments of Central America, al-
though there are humid forests, and trees loaded with epiphytic
vegetation, orchids are few in both species and individuals. Toward
the summit of the Volcano of Turrialba their absence is even more
striking, and not over half a dozen species were found. ‘This is the
more remarkable since the wet forests of Turrialba are richer in
ferns than any locality seen by the writer in Costa Rica, and other
epiphytes are present in quite as great abundance as at La Palma.
It must be that the altitude is too great and the temperature too
low for the needs of orchid growth. It seems certain, therefore,
that the expectations of those who have stated that a whole new
orchid flora would be found on the higher slopes of the Central
American mountains are doomed to disappointment.

There are many other localities in central Costa Rica that furnish
a wealth of orchids. In the wet mountains south of Cartago their
variety is perhaps as great as at La Palma, although individuals
are hardly as numerous. It may be noted, too, that most of the
species found in the latter region are different from those of La
Palma. Even in the immediate vicinity of San José and Cartago,
especially about the latter city, orchids grow upon nearly all the
roadside trees, and even upon fence posts. At La Palma one could
make a fine collection without ever leaving the wagon road.

Costa Rican conditions are extremely favorable for forming a
living collection of orchid plants, yet little has been done in this
direction. Some years ago Dofia Amparo Zeledén assembled in San
José an extensive collection of the more showy species, the plants
having been collected principally by Werckle. Specimens from
plants of this collection have been made the types of new species
by Schlechter. At the present time, because of the absence of its
owner, this collection has unfortunately deteriorated, and compara-
tively few plants remain.

Frequently about San José and Cartago one sees small collections
of orchids about the houses, most of the plants those which produce
conspicuous flowers. One of the finest local collections is that of
Father Benavides, in Heredia. This consists of a very large number
of plants and includes a wonderful display of Cattleyas and other

20397—25——25
374 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

large-flowered local orchids. Father Benavides’ plants are all
grown upon pieces of tree-fern trunks, which are said to furnish
the best medium for the growth of epiphytic species.

The most enthusiastic local student is Mr. C. H. Lankester, of
Cartago, an Englishman who has spent many years in Costa Rica.
A naturalist in the best and widest sense of that word, he has de-
voted much time to the study and collection not only of orchids but
of birds and butterflies, in all of which he has made notable discov-
eries. His present collection of living plants contains a host of
beautiful and interesting forms. Besides local species, he has fine
exotic plants, including some of the most handsome Cattleyas.
He has carried on experiments in hybridization, and has planted
upon trees about his finca hybrids and exotic species, in an attempt
to naturalize them. Mr. Lankester has forwarded many living
orchids to the Kew Gardens, and from his collections there have
been described numerous Costa Rican novelties, including the new
genus Lankesterella.

SOME SHOWY COSTA RICAN ORCHIDS

Costa Rican orchids are famed for their variety and for the beauty
of some of the species. They include all or most of the groups
already mentioned from Panama, besides many that do not occur in
Panama. Most showy of all are the Cattleyas, which are unusually
abundant in Costa Rica.

To these. flowers there is given locally the name guaria, an in-
digenous term. The most plentiful is the guarta morada or purple
Cattleya, C. skinneri (pl. 20), a species which has already been men-
tioned as occurring in Salvador. In Costa Rica it is still more
abundant, growing commonly all over the Pacific slope. The plant
is a great favorite locally, and for this reason is seldom seen wild in
the more thickly populated districts. At Escazti, a small village
near the capital, I have seen a greater profusion than anywhere else,
and a show of great beauty in March and April, when the flowering
season is at its height. There is scarcely a home that does not own at
least a few plants, fastened upon trees in the dooryards, growing up-
on the tile roofs, or forming dense masses along the tops of the
adobe walls that inclose the gardens.

One of the striking features of San José is the great number of
florists who have gardens or jardinerias where flowers are grown for
sale. All over Central America the production of cut flowers is an
industry of considerable importance, and in San José more so than
anywhere else, for the gardens here seem almost without number.
Most of the flowers grown for sale are of common sorts, such as roses,
carnations, and lilies, and they are planted in great abundance. The
ORCHID COLLECTING—STANDLEY 375

cultivation of Cattleyas and other orchids for the sale of their
flowers is common, and in some of the commercial gardens there
are magnificent displays. The fine clump of Catéleya skinner illus-
trated in Plate 20 is from such a garden, owned by an Amer-
ican citizen of Danish origin. In this Milflor garden there is a long
avenue, lined on each side with trees whose trunks are completely
covered with this Cattleya, affording during the flowering season a
gorgeous show of color. In other gardens the display is almost
equally fine. Some of the plants are as large as a washtub and pro-
duce hundreds of blossoms. These last for weeks and are of delicate
shades of rose purple.

The genus Cattleya consists of 30 to 40 species, all of which are
American, extending from Mexico into South America. They are
the favorite orchids for cultivation in the United States and Europe
because of their handsome flowers and even more, perhaps, because
of their easy culture. They are favorites with the hybridizer, and
numerous fine artificial forms have been produced by hybridization.
Many living Cattleya plants are exported from tropical America for
erowth in northern countries. Their flowers are the orchids most
commonly sold in flower shops in the United States, and those gen-
erally associated in the popular mind with the word orchid.

The most prized locally of the Costa Rican orchids is the guaria
blanca or white Cattleya. It is only a color variant of Cattleya
skinneri, but a very distinct one, for the flowers are pure white. It
is a strikingly beautiful plant, and occurs in the wild state, although
it is so much sought after that it is now hard to find. Even in
Costa Rica the plants are held at dear prices, and I was informed of
one fine clump for which $150 had been paid.

The third Costa Rican Cattleya is probably the finest Central
American orchid, and is commonly considered the most gorgeous of
all the Cattleyas. It is the guaria Turrialba or simply Turrialba,
the Turrialba Cattleya, C. dowiana (pl. 21). It takes its name
from the fact that it grows chiefly about the lower slopes of the Vol-
cano of Turrialba, on the Atlantic side of Costa Rica. The writer
was fortunate enough to find a vigorous plant, with buds, in the
forest near Guapiles. This Cattleya also has been so much hunted
by commercial collectors that it is now considered rare. Its sepals
and petals are nankeen yellow, and the ruffled lip is of a rich deep
crimson purple, veined with gold. In color it is quite unlike
any of its relatives, and none of them is so richly decorated.
When first described in Europe by its discoverer, Oersted, botanists
were skeptical as to the accuracy of his description. Although the
Turrialba Cattleya is confined to Costa Rica, several varieties of it
have been reported and introduced into cultivation from Colombia,
one of them with pure yellow flowers.
376 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Next to the Cattleyas, the plants most esteemed for cultivation in
Costa Rica are the Trichopilias. Of these the most common is

Trichopilia suavis (pl. 22), a species occurring also in Panama. —

It is rather frequent in Costa Rican forests at lower altitudes, and
it is possible to find wild plants quite as fine as those of gardens.
The flowers have white or creamy sepals and petals; the lip has a
yellow throat, with rose markings upon a white ground. Tricho-
pilias are well known locally, and even in remote country districts
small children know them by their Latin name.

Other showy species are found among the Odontoglossums, one
of the most popular groups in cultivation of all American orchids.
Odontoglossum schlieperianum (pl. 23, fig. 1) has yellow flowers,
the segments cross-barred with deep purple. The Stanhopeas are.
noted as including many fine plants that are favorites in cultivation.
The one illustrated (pl. 24, fig. 1) has flowers about 4 inches
broad, in which the sepals and petals are pure white, with purple
dots, and the lip white with yellow base and purple mottlings.

Many other Costa Rican orchids deserve mention, but without
illustrations they would be no more than mere names. The Miltonias
are almost as beautiful as the Cattleyas, and there are other little
known plants that are noteworthy because of their exceptionally
handsome blossoms. pidendrum endresii, a dwarf plant with!
clusters of pure white flowers, handsomely spotted with purple, is
one of the most delicately beautiful of all. The most common and
striking orchid of the Meseta Central of Costa Rica is L’pidendrum
radicans, which is found nearly everywhere at certain elevations.
It is a terrestrial plant, its slender, erect or climbing stems, with
their numerous thick aerial roots and broad thick leaves, topped
with a cluster of orange-scarlet flowers. In many localities it al-
most assumes the character of a weed, and grows in the greatest
abundance. The writer was shown an unusually interesting and
large colony by Mr. Lankester in a curious habitat upon his finca
at Las Céncavas. Here it occurred in great profusion in a marsh
along with a Habenaria and, strangely enough, the common royal
fern, just as we find the last in the eastern United States. Such a
habitat is quite unusual, for ordinarily the scarlet Hpidendrum in-
habits rather well drained banks and meadows.

Another fine Epidendrum is /. lindleyanum (pl. 28, fig. 2), a
plant sometimes referred to the genus Barkeria. The specimens
illustrated were obtained at Orosi by Don Anastasio Alfaro, direc-
tor of the Costa Rican National Museum, an enthusiastic orchid col-
lector. In this plant the flowers are rose purple, and the petals and
sepals well over an inch in length. EL pidendrum ciliare (pl. 24, fig.
2) is a widely distributed plant in tropical America, and one of the
ORCHID COLLECTING—STANDLEY 377

most attractive of its group. The sepals and petals (about 3 inches
long) are greenish yellow, and the pure white lip is divided into
many long threadlike lobes.

The species of Acineta illustrated (pl. 25) is a relative of the Gon-
goras (pl. 15) that are so common in Panama. The Pleurothallis
(pl. 26, fig. 2) is a representative of one of the largest genera of
of American orchids. This one, however, is scarcely typical of the
genus, since it is a plant several feet high, while the other species

seldom attain a height of more than 2 or 38 inches. The
species of Pleurothallis, although highly interesting to the botanist,
are of no value for cultivation.

In view of the large collections of orchids that have been made in
recent years in Costa Rica and elsewhere in Central America, it is
sometimes asked by persons unfamiliar with the region whether
there may not be danger of their extinction. It may be stated that
there is no danger of this, so far as the operations of collectors for
study purposes are concerned. Commercial collectors hunt only the
showy plants, and even these are probably in no immediate danger
of extermination. In the case of herbarium collections, only a few
specimens of a given species are taken, and there is no possibility of
exhaustion from this source. The greatest menace is the clearing of
the forests for agricultural purposes, which in Salvador has pro-
ceeded so far as almost to eliminate the primeval vegetation; but the
rapid extension of the agricultural areas in Central America is far
more important and desirable, it is needless to remark, than the pres-
ervation of orchid species. In favorable localities in Costa Rica it
would be possible to gather in a short time many tons of orchid
plants without exhausting the supply. When we remember the in-
credible number of seeds produced by orchids, we wonder only that
they do not dominate vegetation everywhere in the Tropics.

SKETCHES FROM THE NOTEBOOK OF A NATURALIST-
TRAVELER IN OCEANIA DURING THE YEAR 1923

By Casry A. Woop

Since every visitor to Polynesia and Australasia must perforce say
something about Captain Cook, the mutineers of the Bounty, and
the Southern Cross, I need not apologize for beginning my obser-
vations with a few notes on these attractive subjects.

Imprimis, I discovered that my recollections of the three voyages
of Cook and of his remarkable scientific career were not as fresh as
they ought to be for one who proposed to travel over that quarter
of the globe he described so clearly over a hundred years ago. In-
deed, after reading the account given in his “ Voyages,” one feels
that very little of importance has since been published touching the
early history of the South Seas, many of whose islands he placed on
the map. Certainly, since the publication of his reports we have
not learned much more concerning the customs and lives of the
natives.

James Cook, son of a common agricultural laborer, was born in
Yorkshire, October 27, 1728. His parents tried to fashion him into
a haberdasher, but the lure of the ocean was too much for him and
them and—an old, familiar British boy’s tale—he quit the trade and
went to sea as a common sailor. After various adventures along the
British coast and in the Baltic he volunteered as an able seaman in
the royal navy, assisted at the capture of Quebec, charted the lower
St. Lawrence and the shores of Newfoundland and succeeded in
proving to his superiors that he was no idler in his chosen profes-
sion but aspired to the highest command possible to a self-taught
mariner. When, in the year 1768, the Government, at the suggestion
of the Royal Society, decided to send an expedition to the South
Seas for the purpose of observing the transit of Venus over the sun’s
disk, Lieutenant Cook, then 40 years of age and in the full posses-
sion of his powers, was placed in command. From that date the
Pacific and its wonderful islands became his special domain and his
accounts of his three voyages of observation and discovery make
fascinating reading. It must be remembered that at least two of the
adventures were undertaken in the company of well-trained natural-

379
380 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

ists, students of Linnaeus, who probably “checked up”, most of the
reports on animal life with which his pages are crowded. On June
25, 1776, Captain Cook sailed on his last voyage—an expedition fit-
ted out by the British Government for the chief purpose of discover-
ing a northwest passage from the Pacific side — to do from the west-
ward what Franklin and others were later to attempt from the east.
On Valentine’s Day, 1779, he was clubbed to death by the natives of
Hawaii, with whom his men had an altercation—a most tragic end
for a man who had uniformly treated the aborigines of the lands
he visited with humanity and tact and with such a just regard for
their peculiar viewpoints.

His accounts abound with references to the abundant faunal,
especially the avian, life of Polynesia. Listen, for example, to this
extract from his “ First Voyage”: “Northward from Botany Bay
* * * we have for some days past seen the sea birds, called boob-
ies, which from half an hour before sunrising to half an hour after
were continually passing the ship in large flights, from which it was
conjectured that there was a river or inlet of shallow waiter to the
southward, where they went to feed in the day, returning in the
evening to some islands to the northward.” Of course these were
not Sula bassana, that exclusive Atlantic bird, but the Booby gan-
net—Sulu leucogastra—seen on both sides of the American Conti-
nents. I am morally certain that it was some descendants of these
same boobies that we saw as we sailed the same waters.

For his second voyage the Government employed H. M. Barque
Endeavour, 370 tons, complement 84. With this equipment the
transit was successfully witnessed (on Tahiti) and duly reported, in
the Philosophical Transactions for the year 1771.

Several designations remain to mark this adventure: Two of these
are, the group name, Society Islands, from the Royal Society; and
Point Venus, about ten miles from Papeete, where the transit was
observed. The British were so well pleased with Cook’s part in this
undertaking that they placed him in command of a second expedi-
tion to complete the discovery of another continent that most geog-
raphers believed existed in the Southern Hemisphere. Two ships
were this time commissioned for the purpose, the Resolution, 462
tons, and the Adventure, 336 tons. They were well equipped and
liberally provided with scientific apparatus and stores. As with the
reports of the first voyage so is the second replete with clear descrip-
tions of the fauna of the islands visited. As they sailed south from
New Zealand, for instance, they fell in with several large islands
and, at last, with a quantity of loose ice. Here they saw “ gray
albatrosses, blue peterels, pintadoes, and fulmers.” Still later they
got two of the Antarctic petrels. “These are about the size of a
large pigeon; the feathers of the head, back, and part of the upper
OCEANIA—WOOD 381

side of the wings are of a light brown, the belly and underside of
the wings white; the tail feathers are also white, but tipped with
brown. These birds are fuller of feathers than any we had hitherto
seen ; such care has nature taken to clothe them suitable to the climate
in which they live.” And the foregoing description has not since
the days of Cook been much improved upon.

Probably Captain Cook’s “blue peterels” were of the genus
Prion—the small dove petrels, whose upper surface is ashy blue,
with white below. They are only about 12 inches long, with a jet-
black, pyramidal band stretching from one leg to the other across
the rump, which shows very plainly during flight.

The “Antartic peterel” may be that allied species, Prion desol-
atus. ‘They do not attend ships, being suspicious of man and all
his works, but follow the whale and feed upon not the crumbs but
the more substantial fragments that fall from his ample maw.
Hence their vulgar name of whale bird. I have never seen this spe-
cies alive, but they are said to be nocturnal in their habits. The
“pintado” is more certainly the pretty little cape petrel—Daption
capensis, or cape pigeon, so called from its superficial resemblance
to a pigeon, with head spotted with black and a pure white
belly. This small petrel, well known to travelers in the South
Pacific, eagerly feeds on scraps thrown from vessels, and even dives
after them, like a duck. If caught, Daption, like others of his kind,
tries to defend himself by ejecting an offensive fluid at and over his
captor. Although essentially an Antarctic bird, it is occasionally
seen as far north as Ceylon and California.

Although Captain Cook did not find a northwest passage, even
with the aid of his good ships Resolution, of 462 tons, and Discovery,
300 tons, yet he made for his Government many other discoveries
that were, perhaps, of greater value.

It may with truth be claimed that the traveler who first saw and
described the famous constellation, the Southern Cross, was an
American. When Americo Vespucci, on his first voyage, saw the
constellation, he wrote in triumph that he had beheld the Cross—
and Dante’s “ four stars.” A friend has drawn my attention to the
poet’s description :

To the right I turned and fixed my mind
On the other pole attentive, where I saw
Four stars ne’er seen before save by the ken
Of our first parents.
Heaven of their ray seemed joyous.
O, thou northern site, bereft
Indeed, and widowed, since of these deprived.”
_ This quotation is from Canto I, of the “Purgatorio,” in Cary’s
translation.
20397—25———_26
382 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

The Cross lies directly south of the constellation Crater, and
about 30° of the pole. The precession of the equinoxes is carrying
the Cross steadily southward, and it is said to be a fact that the
constellation was last seen on the horizon in the latitude of Judea
about the time of Christ’s crucifixion. I remember that at the
season of the year we were at Assouan the four stars (perhaps only
two of them, really) were barely visible on the horizon for a short
time in the early evening. I do not agree with Pigafetta that it is
such a Croce maravigliosa, but then I was more gradually intro-
duced to it than he, and I didn’t see it with his deeply religious and
fervent eyes.

It must not be forgotten that Job saw the Cross as a familiar
heavenly series in his northern skies, as did many another ancient
and reliable astronomer, and yet they were not much impressed
by this kite-like group. Let me add that of the four stars that
outline the Cross the third largest (Gamma, at the top of the Cross)
is orange-colored; the others are white.

The Breadfruit tree, as I have seen it in the West Indies, South
America, and on these islands, is a very handsome ornament of the
landscape. The common variety (Artocarpus incisa) may grow to
a height of 50 feet and, with its long, dark, glossy leaves, at once
attracts attention. The fruit is round-oval, is about the size of a
child’s head, and is covered with lozenge-shaped elevations. The
unripe fruit is green; yellow when mature. For cooking, it should
be gathered before it is fully ripe. The fruit is then baked and
served with the rind, after the manner of our squash. Stones are
heated in the usual Polynesian fashion (or a more up-to-date oven
is used), the breadfruit is cut in three or four slices, and then
alternate layers of hot stones, leaves, and cut fruit are well covered
with leaves and earth and left to cook in their own juices. Pre-
pared in this fashion the pulpy interior is a faintly sweet, starchy
substance suggesting the crumb of a wheaten loaf. I can not say
that I regard it as more than a poor substitute for our white bread.

Alfred R. Wallace, in his Malay Archipelago, rates its food value
very high, and says that with meat and gravy it seemed to him
superior to any starchy products in any temperate or tropical
country. He also draws attention to the delicious puddings that
can be made from it, especially if one adds plenty of sugar, milk,
and butter! Perhaps the most important consideration, as Wallace
also points out, is that a fair quality of flour can be manufactured
from the dried fruit, available for a decent variety of bread and
biscuits. I suppose there is no harm in adding that the bark, trunk,
and gum of this tree is (or was) used by the natives of Polynesia
for making all sorts of things—canoes, baskets, etc.
OCEANIA—WO0OOD 383

For me the chief attraction of this subject lies in the fact that
we have sailed relatively near the scene of the greatest breadfruit
story in all history. In 1772 William Bligh, then only 18 years
of age, accompanied Captain Cook on his second expedition to the
South Seas (1772-1774) as sailing master of the Resolution. The
young man was greatly interested in the New World that was in
this way opened up to him, and made a particular study of the
Polynesian flora and fauna. When the expedition reached Otaheite
(Tahiti) Bligh became acquainted with the wonderful breadfruit,
and talked and wrote so much about it that his fellow officers nick-
named him “Breadfruit Bligh.” At the end of 1787 he was sent
to Polynesia in command of H. M. 8S. Bounty to gather bread fruit
and other plants for cultivation in the West Indies. The expedition
gained Otaheite in the spring of 1788. What happened. shortly
afterwards is told by Lieutenant Bligh in a small volume entitled
“The Mutiny on Board Bounty :” “We sailed from Otaheite April 4,
1788, having on board 1,015 fine breadfruit plants, besides many
other valuable fruits of that country which we had been collecting
for three and twenty weeks, and which were in the highest state
of perfection.” Two weeks later he was seized in his cabin by the
ship’s master of arms and two others of the crew, pinioned and
threatened with death if he made resistance. The crew also seized
most of the other officers and gained control of the ship. The
captain and 17 others were forced into the ship’s longboat, 25
mutineers remaining on board. Lieutenant Bligh and the 17,
touching at several islands by the way, finally reached Batavia and
eventually England. The mutineers sailed the Bounty to Tahiti,
where most of them elected to remain. Six of these were later ap-
prehended, taken to England, placed on trial and three were exe-
cuted. Meantime, in 1790, Fletcher Christian, the leader of the
mutiny, 8 other Englishmen, 6 Polynesian men, and 12 Poly-
nesian women embarked on board the Bounty and, after cruising
about the Paumotus, took possession of Pitcairn, on the out-
skirts of that archipelago. This island is a mountainous, volcanic
uplift area about 2 square miles, with several fertile valleys. Here
this curious colony, having burned the Bounty, seems to have dis-
appeared from the sight and knowledge of man. By the year 1800
all but one Englishman—Alexander Smith, who assumed the name
of John Adams—had died. He appears to have been one of the
few colonists to preserve a sense of responsibility, as he gained the
respect of the natives and induced them to bring up their children
in at least a semicivilized fashion. It was not until 1808 that the
lost colony was discovered by an American vessel, the Y'opaze.
Later other ships touched at Pitcairn and brought news of the
384 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

mutineers’ descendants to the outside world. John Adams lived
until 1829, and was succeeded by George Nobbs as chief magistrate.
Through fear of drought, the whole colony were returned to Tahiti
in 1830 on a British man-of-war, but they disliked the change, pined
for their beloved Pitcairn, and were sent back in 1831.

The Pitcairners thereafter had an up-and-down career for another
25 years, when, in 1856, 60 married and 134 youngsters were again
removed, this time to Norfolk Island. As time passed a number
(40) returned to Pitcairn, so that in 1895 the population was about
170 souls. The Pitcairn people continue to speak the patois, mostly
composed of the Tahitian of the original Polynesian women, that
arose out of the mixed races that migrated in the days of the Bounty,
and, although they show some of the signs of inbreeding consequent
on their century of complete isolation, are, as a rule, intelligent and,
for Polynesian half-breeds, an active and virile race.

The romantic story of the Bounty excited much interest all over
the world, and attracted the attention of Lord Byron, then ap-
proaching the end of his tragic career. He further immortalized the
mutineers in a poem—the last long one from his pen—entitled “The
Island.”

It is due to the memory of William Bligh, who rose to distinction
and became an admiral in the British Navy, that the mutiny on his
ship was no fault of his rule, but was the outcome of relations estab-
lished between members of the crew and the women of the enchanted
isle of Otaheite, an attraction that seems to have retained much of
its force since the day that Cook sailed into the lagoon-harbor of
Papeete.

Several friends have asked me whether the descriptions of tropical
scenery and of tropical life—humay, floral, and feral—that one reads
as part of the voluminous literature of Polynesia, are not largely
figments of the literary imagination. To this I answer: “Gen-
erally speaking, no; but not infrequently, yes.” After all, the ver-
dict depends upon the individual. Some there are who see only the
beauty and the romance that is Oceania, while others, following an
identical itinerary, see little that is satisfactory and learn only that
Polynesian man in vile. Some are convinced that on these tropical
islands “every prospect pleases” and that only the human element is
objectionable; contrariwise, there are those who find all jungles and
all atolls alike and that only the aboriginal or the “introduced”
beach-comber is of interest. In all probability the truth lies midway.
In any event I feel certain that the unprejudiced observer will always
discover a continued charm in a country that is wholly new, remark-
ably varied as one travels from one island group to another, and full
of natural history wonders. Possibly the following descriptions,
OCEANIA—W0OOD 385

that I jotted down in my notebook from time to time, may appear to
be sentimental exaggerations and worthy of being classed with the
productions of South Sea “fakirs”, but they were, at the time of ob-
servation at least, genuine impressions: One evening, half an hour
before sunset, when E. and I were on the deck of our steamer then
lying in the Papeete lagoon, she drew my attention to the fact that
the two large islands, Tahiti and Moorea, the latter 20 miles distant,
are admirably situated for displaying the wondrous magnificence of
a tropical sunset. And so it proved on that occasion. Between the
islands, in the roadstead, is a toy islet, with its quota of palms and
other trees, that does duty as a quarantine station. Some time after
the mountain peaks of Moorea obscured the setting sun, the weird and
loftier crags of Tahiti were brilliantly lighted by solar streamers
that seem to stretch across from the sister island. As the sun sank
below the true horizon and the shades of tropical evening deepened
into night all our surroundings—ocean, sky, mountains and islet—
became the scene of fairy-like kaleidoscopic, color transformations
that changed every minute, punctuated by the distant but regular
roar of the breakers on the barrier reef and the cool “whiffs” of the
delicious land breeze one may with confidence look for at nightfall in
most of the southern Tropics. We agreed that we had seen as lovely
sunsets elsewhere, but none with such a remarkable environment.
Here is another note: Last August (at the end of the southern win-
ter) I wished to study (in their wild state) the beautiful fruit pigeons
of Fiji, and for that purpose took a native cutter bound for Kandavu,
a mountainous, volcanic island, the most southerly of the Viti group
and in the fifties an American whaling station of sorts.
Kandavu is about 27 miles long, four wide, and lies 60 miles from
Viti Levu. This charming volcanic uplift is practically shut off
from the world. On it are only four or five white planters who have
no telephones or telegraph stations, no roads and no post offices
worth talking about. There is no communication with the other
islands except by occasional—very occasional—Fijian craft. Now
and then a native journeys from one village to another over ill-
kept jungle trails, almost impassable to Europeans. My artist com-
panion—a dextrous painter of animal life—and I put up at the
hospitable home of Mr. and Mrs. M., educated English people and
the only Europeans on the western end of the island. Their house
was built on an eminence, itself surrounded by verdure-clad hills,
except toward the northwest, where an opening in the hilly amphi-
theater furnished a view of a beautiful bay. In its turn the bay was
protected and cut off from the ocean by a coral reef that continuously
threw up a succession of many-sounding breakers whose outlines were
plainly visible by contrast with the blue waters of the bay. Trees
of every tropical variety, both wild and cultivated, covered the bowl
386 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of this ancient crater, while birds of many kinds—parrots, para-
keets, sun birds, Fiji “robins,” honeyeaters, fantails, pigeons, doves,
hawks—gave additional color to the landscape and lent musical
notes to the loud babbling of a brook that ran past the house on its
way to the ocean. As if to perfect this Fijian paradise, the white
blossoms of several frangipane trees blew their strong fragrance
through our rooms day and night.

Unless I was too fatigued from tramping over hill and dale
through the rather difficult jungle, I rose an hour before daybreak
that I might refresh myself by drinking in the glories of the star-
light sky, much of which I had seen in 1928 for the first time. Stand-
ing well within the bowl of the long-inactive crater, the oncoming
dawn was an entirely new experience. ‘As the eastern heavens
lightened, the shadows of the valley beneath appeared to deepen, but
at last the honeyeaters began their earliest notes, and with these
matin songs the outlines of cocoa palms, breadfruit trees, mangoes,
bananas, and other plants assumed individuality until over the edges
of the green-rimmed hills streamed the first rays of the morning sun.
They fell upon the opposite slopes, bringing with them a perfumed
atmosphere redolent of the ever-flowering trees, shrubs, and vines
that clothed the green hillsides to their very tops. Of course, the
wonders of rosy-fingered dawn have been celebrated in song, verse,
and prose many times these thousand years, but my contention is
that when dark night rolls back into the ocean around wild Kandavu
it does so in a fashion all its own. Other sunrises may be as im-
pressive and as beautiful, but when viewed from the Korolevu crater
they have charms inherent in their environment—charms due to just
those every-day surroundings that are tropical life.

What is true of the scenery, the flora, the fauna, and the meteor-
ology of Polynesia is also true of its human element. I am quite
sure that while writers of Oceanic fiction often draw upon their
boundless stories of pasteboard heroes and heroines for tales that
are largely products of an excited imagination, there are many lives
at this moment being lived on the islands of the South Seas that prop-
erly belong either to a century in advance or several hundred years
behind our own times. I wish I had the space and the permission
to relate the intimate histories of some waifs and strays as well as
of some idealists whose acquaintance I made during my sojourn in
central Polynesia. The objection of publishing the recitals would
be the raising of doubts as to their reality, whether such individuals
live within the realms of fact or fiction. So, I would say, nothing
any South Sea romancer may write is likely to transcend the limits
of the possible so long as he deals with human beings.
OCEANIA—WOOD 887

Of course we were much interested in and always on the watch for
a sight of an albatross. The Pacific coast is occasionally the resort
of four humble members of the family, but not of “the bird that
made the wind to blow.” He, the wandering albatross (Diomedea
exulans), is almost pure white, the back showing narrow, transverse,
wavy dark lines, the quills of the wing feathers being black. Some
writers probably exaggerate this bird’s spread of wing; Ridgway
says that it is about 11 feet (from 125 to 130 inches). The bill is
yellow, becoming orange at the base.

Many are the descriptions of the wonderful powers of flight shown
by this denizen of the southern ocean. For instance, Greenbie is
moved to use the following language: “ But chill and melancholy as
was that southern sea, there hovered over it a creature whose call
upon one’s interest was more than compensating. Swooping with
giant wings in careless ease, the albatrosses follow us day in and day
out. Always on the wing, awake or asleep, in sunshine or in storm,
the air his home as water is to fish, and earth to mammal. Even the
ship was no lure to him by way of support. He followed it, accepted
whatever was thrown him from it, but as for dependence upon it—
no such weakness. Swift, huge, glorious, unconsciously majestic,
he is indeed a bird of good omen. How he floats with never a sign
of effort! How he glides atop the waves, skims them, yet is never
reached by their flame-like leapings; simulates their motion with-
out the exhaustion into which they sink incessantly. He does not
gorge himself as does the sea gull, nor is he ever heard to screech
that selfish, hungry, insatiable screech. Silent, sadly voiceless,
rhythmic, symbolic without being restrained by pride of art, he ex-
emplifies right living. He is our link between shores, the one dream
of reality on an ocean of opiate loveliness wherein there is little of
earth’s confusion and pain.”

Major Le Souef reports (#mu, p. 58, 1922) that during a recent
trip to England from Sydney Diomedea exulans was much in evi-
dence, and was a faithful follower of the ship.. As soon, however,
as the outside temperature rose above 70 degrees F. at 4 o’clock
p. m. the wandering albatross invariably left the track of the ship
and flew southward in search of cooler weather. In other words,
Le Souef thinks that temperature is an important factor in de-
termining the range of this bird. He calculated the flight of these
albatrosses at from 20 to 40 miles an hour. He also noticed that
the Atlantic adults have more brown in their plumage than those
he saw in the Indian Ocean, the latter presenting beautiful, pure
white wings whose silvery tones are heightened by their black tips.
I have also noticed the effect of temperature on range (and have
reported it in the same journal) relative to the New Zealand
888 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

albatross (Diomedea regia), that I regard as the most beautiful,
although it is not the largest of the albatrosses.

Another bird I saw in the South Seas was Phaethon rubricaudus,
the red-tailed Tropic bird, largest of the genus. He derives his
name from the bright crimson-red of his elongated and very at-
tenuated rectrices. His mandibles are also red, and, when full.
grown, his white plumage is tinted a deep roseate hue—altogether
a beautiful bird. I wrote from South America of my experiences
with the yellow-billed Tropic bird (P. flavirostris) (called “long-
tails” in Bermuda), and I was on tiptoe to see his relative flying
about the southern ocean. Moreover, I hoped to see a young bird,
with the black, arrow-head markings on its back. I also wondered
whether those barbarians who shoot this lovely creature for the
bright red feathers of his tail (let us not forget those participites
criminis who wear them) are still at their nefarious work.

Stevenson, one of the most: careful observers, several times speaks
of the southern Tropic bird. In one instance he makes, however, a
mistake which is quite pardonable, and which has been made by
others, in supposing that there is but one, and not two, long feathers
in the bird’s tail—an error due to the fact that in molting the
feathers are renewed irregularly and, in consequence, one feather
frequently projects much beyond its fellow and gives the appearance
of a single plume. The paragraph referred to is from “The Ebb
Tide,” page 130:“* * * around and about the schooner a Tropic
bird, white as a snowflake, hung and circled, and displayed, as it
turned, the long vermilion feather in its tail.”

While climbing the long but beautifully shaded trail that zigzags
the slopes of Mount Vaea on a pilgrimage to Stevenson’s tomb we
saw, sailing up and down the valley beneath us, a splendid red tail,
flying directly over Vailima. Perhaps he was a descendant of one
of the poet’s birds.

Mr. D. McDonald, chief officer of the steamship 7ahiti, who for
years has studied the oceanic life of Phaethon rubricaudus, tells me
that these birds come on board practically always at night; and
when they do so it is not (or rarely) because of exhaustion or be-
cause they are blown aboard, but because they are attracted by one
or other of the ship’s lights. They generally fly directly at the lan-
tern, and are often stunned by the impact. They then fall onto the
deck and, owing partly to the confusion produced by the blow, are
unable to fly off again. Mr. McDonald does not think that the in-
jury is alone responsible for their helplessness (that generally leads
to their capture) ; in addition, they seem unable to get a grip on the
smooth, often slippery, deck without which they can not acquire the
headway necessary for upward flight. Nor does he believe that, as
OCEANIA—WO0OOD 389

may obtain in the case of insects, they are lured by the illuminated
lantern as such, for no sea bird would deliberately smash into an
object, especially one so visible as a night light, unless he were de-
ceived as to its solidarity. No; the fact is the bird thinks, so avers
Mr. McDonald, that the lighted area of the lantern and its imme-
diate surroundings constitutes an exit into daylight beyond. We all
know that a bird in a darkened barn or other inclosure easily dis-
covers and flies through a hole or other opening that gives on the
daylight. It is not that he is attracted by the light area of the exit,
but he visualizes and seeks, by means of the opening, the free air of
heaven beyond. Thus it is with certain birds at sea; they expect to
fly through the light and not at it. The dark or dimly-lighted
canopy of the night represents to them a sort of antechamber of the
day; the light at the masthead is one of, it may be, many openings
through which the great, diurnal outdoors may be reached. Pensiert
vani for the bird, you may say, but not more vain, is it, than the
beliefs about the causes of daylight and darkness that were devoutly
held by educated and polished races of mankind not so many years
ago. I can not recollect that Gaetke or any other observer of light-
house tragedies has explained them in this fashion, but the chief
officer’s theory sounds feasible to me. At any rate I give it for
what it may be worth.

Then there is that other question in comparative psychology to
answer: Is there, in this search for light, evidence of a superior or
of an inferior avian intelligence? Because we know that there are
sea birds that follow or fly about ships who are not attracted by
lights in this manner—gulls and albatrosses, for example—probably
because these are not nocturnal wanderers, except on moonlight
nights.

Among the many Australasian avifauna that I was set upon see-
ing in their native surroundings if possible, was the lyre bird—
familiar to everyone who has read about the curiosities of the
“Lonely Continent.” It is only the full-grown male that has the
wonderful tail—composed of 16 feathers, the two outer curved
to form that remarkable lyre-shaped ornament that distinguishes
it from any other species. The best known and the most highly
ornamented species (Menura superba) is a native of New South
Wales and southern Queensland. It is about as large as a small
turkey. The possession of this beautiful and wondrous tail is not,
however, the only unusual quality that distinguishes this peculiar
bird; he is a fine singer and peerless mimic. Just how he came
to be included in the Pseudoscines, or false song birds, is difficult to
understand, considering that his musical ability has been known
‘and recognized from early Australian days. Another accomplish-
390 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

ment is his well-developed powers of mimicry. This additional at-
tainment was especially insisted upon by an Australian ornithologist,
guest of the British Ornithologists’ Club, when I was in London
last summer. He claimed that the male Menura is unequaled in
this respect; and we know that many other observers have recorded
instances of this curious trait. One gentleman had a lyre bird as
a pet around his farm in Australia for a great many years. “There
was nothing he could not imitate. The following are a few of his
mimicries: The noise of a horse and dray moving slowly, with
the play of the wheels in the axle boxes, chains rattling, etc.; an
occasional ‘ Gee up, Bess’; the sound of a violin, piano, cornet, cross-
cut saw, and so on. All the more frequent noises heard about the
farm the bird learned to perfection, such as a pig being killed, a dog
howling, child crying, cries of a flock of parrots, jackass laughing,
and many calls of small birds.”

It was a rare privilege for me to see in company with Doctor
Le Souef, director of the Sydney Zoo, and a number of other dis-
tinguished ornithologists, three of these remarkable birds in the Na-
tional Park, exhibiting the best of their mimetic and other stunts.
You can imagine how lucky I was when Gould relates that he was
a year in Australia without seeing one, although he heard many.

I never see the name Norfolk Island (past which we sailed) with-
out recalling the image of a transplanted, but perfect example of its
so-called pine—the beautiful Araucaria excelsa—60 feet high, deli-
cate green, and straight as a die, that one may at any time see near
the Hotel del Coronado. This symmetrical beauty performs the use-
ful function each holiday season of a live, outdoor Christmas tree.
Bedight with colored electric lights from its spreading base to its
conical top, it is easily the observed of all observers, and both day
and night is a most attractive object. As if further to fit the pur-
pose for which it is borrowed, the extreme apex of the tree termi-
nates in a sort of Maltese cross, and forms a convenient and appro-
priate anchorage for the traditional Star of Bethlehem. It was
Captain Cook who discovered and christened the island—after the
ducal family of the same name. He says of the tree: “The chief
produce is a sort of spruce pine, which grows in abundance and to a
great size, many of the trees being as thick, breast high, as two men
could fathom, and exceeding straight and tall. It resembles the
Quebec pine”—and we must not forget that for several years the
captain cultivated the acquaintance of Lower Canadian timber.

There is, or rather was, a beautiful Norfolk Island parrot (Nestor
norfolcensis) of which only one bird skin remains, and a single draw-
ing to perpetuate its memory. Thus vanishing is many another
species and race of Polynesian fauna.

It was reminiscent of home to find the Pacific godwit (Limosa
lapponica baueri) in north New Zealand. I am also reminded that
there is at least one compensation in visiting Australasia during the
“off” season for birds; one sees some old friends in the shape of
migrants who for reasons of their own fly across thousands of miles
of ocean to spend the winter in that delectable land. It might be
supposed that all birds that insist on breeding in countries with a
snowy season would, after a dozen or two generations of experience,
seek the nearest warm or moderate winter climate furnishing suf-
ficient food. However, as every budding ornithologist knows, some
do not, and perhaps not even the most erudite and experienced stu-
dent of bird behavior knows always why. In any event, the at-
tempted solution of this problem has added much literature to dis-
tributional ornithology, and it is still coming in. Speaking again of
godwit migration, at the northern extremity of North Island, New
Zealand, is the Bay of Spirits—so called from the Maori belief that
the souls of the dead take their flight into the other world from this
locality. It is an uninhabited lonely coast, the last stepping-off place,
as it were, and would appear to be appropriate for the purpose as-
signed to it by a barbaric but imaginative race. There is, however,
another reason, probably the reason, for this tradition: also at the
northern tip of long and narrow New Zealand is the rocky plateau
where the godwits assemble in thousands for their annual return to
Siberia. It must be a wonderful and awe-inspiring sight. Even the
matter-of-fact Buller (Manual, p. 56) is moved to these words:
“ Rising from the beach in 2 long line and much clamor, they form
into a broad semicircle and, mounting high in the air, generally take
a course due north; sometimes they rise in a confused manner; and,
after circling about at a considerable height, return to the beach to
reform, as it were, their ranks, and then make a fresh start on their
distant journey. The departure from any fixed locality usually
begins on almost the exact date year after year; and for a week or
10 days after the migration has commenced fresh parties are con-
stantly on the wing, the flight generally taking place about sunset,
and sometimes after dark.” Does it not seem likely that a people of
our own Aryan stock might easily translate this truly wonder-
working episode into the belief, so firmly held by most aboriginals,
of a happy hunting ground to which journey the spirits of the dead
when this fitful fever called life has run its course?

Not only is the parson bird (Prosthemadera novae-zealandiae)
or tui, as he is called by the Maoris, one of the most striking but he
is also among the most interesting of the New Zealand avifauna.
Imagine a bird about the size and general appearance of our common
‘crow, generally of a metallic bluish or greenish black, the upper
392 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

part of his neck wearing a collar of gray, threadlike plumes with
an outward curve. There is also a prominent white spot near each
shoulder, and from the throat of the adult bird hang two tufts of
white, curly feathers that look for all the world like the white bands
of an ecclesiastic. Moreover this prominent “choker” can readily
be seen as the bird flies about from tree to tree; and it is impossible
to mistake him for any other species. In the Auckland district he
is most likely to be found in the “ranges,” so, one fine day, accom-
panied by Mr. R. A. Falla, (R. A. O. U.) of Devonport, we made
a field trip to these hills, where we saw a number of tuis, beautiful
pied fantails (Rhipidura flabellijera), silver eyes (Zosterops caeru-
lescens), and many another beauty in the tree ferns, shrubs and other
foliage; while, flying high in the air, was a hawk (probably V esierax
australis), a colony of parrots—very likely of the introduced Rosella
parakeet—and a number of others. We took our luncheon on the
slope of a gulley whose sides and bottom were covered with a won-
derful array of tree ferns, while our tablecloth was spread on a bed
of New Zealand bracken of sufficient thickness to raise it well above
the level of our feet. Here, while we discussed our simple meal with
an outdoor appetite, Falla, an experienced ornithologist, gave the
tui call and before long there was an answer from the depths of the
forest. Then two birds came within plain sight, and after looking
us over approached so that with our glasses we could study them in
every detail, even to the whitish line that separates the nuchal
feathers and the white spots on the wings.

Greenbie (The Pacific Triangle—1921) says of the parson bird:
“ No sound of bird in any of the many countries I have been to has
ever filled me with greater rapture than did this. There are thous-
ands of skylarks in New Zealand, brought from England, but had
Shelley heard the tui he might have written an ode more beautiful
even than that to the “blithe spirit.” he has immortalized.”

Buller (Manual, p. 10) remarks that “Owing to its excellent
powers of mimicry, and the facility of rearing it in confinement, it
is a favorite cage bird, both with the natives and with the colonists.
Although of very delicate constitution, it has been known to live in
confinement for upward of ten years. More frequently, however,
it becomes the subject, after the first year, to convulsive fits, under
which it ultimately succumbs. Cleanliness, a well-regulated diet,
and protection from extremes of temperature are the proper safe-
ouards. Naturally of a sprightly disposition, it is cheerful and
playful in captivity, incessantly flitting about in its cage and mimick-
ing every sound within hearing. It will learn to articulate sentences
of several words with clearness and to imitate the barking of a dog
to perfection. The Maoris appreciated the mocking powers of this
bird and devoted much time and patience to its instruction.”
OCEANIA—WO0OOD 393

Mr. Louis Griffin, of the Auckland Museum, tells me that he once
possessed a tui, of whom he became very fond. This interesting
animal not only reproduced many of the sounds he heard but re-
peated a number of short sentences appropriate to various occasions.
He took a bath twice a day and on these occasions invariably dipped
his head and white choker in the water as a first ablution. He
then carefully preened himself, drying and arranging his ecclesiastic
insignia, afterwards taking a plunge that involved his whole body.
Then, when the bath was fully concluded, he would fly to his master’s
hand, perch himself on it, and repeat a portion of his conversational
repertoire. Twice he escaped from the house and once he returned.
On the second occasion, although he remained about the premises
for a day or two and answered Mr. Griffin’s call, it was the “time
of the spring running,” and he never came back.

The pied fantail must attract the pleased attention of every
visitor to New Zealand, as it is to be seen almost everywhere on both
islands. It and its Australian cousin are among the most attractive
of the small flycatchers. They seem to be constantly on the wing,
performing (with tail widespread) the most varied and fantastic
evolutions in their pursuit of flies and gnats invisible to our dull
eyes; in fact, they hold the blue ribbon for artistic gymnastics. The
New Zealand bird is facile princeps flycatcher of the world series.

There are many reasons why the word “ gull,” used as a synonym
of “dupe” or “ fool,” is a misnomer. It is difficult to understand
how this misapplication came about. I have made a study of gulls
for many years, and rank them high among the intelligent orders.
In fact I regard them not only as types of avian grace and beauty,
but as examples of advanced intelligence; and, in that respect I
agree cordially with the views of the Finleys, who, within the past
year, have written a paper (see The Atlantic Monthly) on this self-
same subject. In my opinion and experience, gulls are by no means
“ oullible.” Last summer we were staying for a short time at
the Atlantic Hotel at Newquay, England; and, while at breakfast,
we noticed a full-grown herring gull fly from the seashore, a few
hundreds yards away, and light on the terrace close by the dining
room. He was followed shortly by others and by still others until
there were, perhaps fifty waiting about. My wonder at this strange
phenomenon was soon satisfied; they, too, had come for breakfast.
In a few minutes one of the hotel people arrived with a can of
“leftovers,” and it certainly was a sight to watch the array of
heads, wings, feet, and bodies that forthwith hid, as by a dense
cloud, the scattered piles of food. It was especially interesting
to watch the late arrivals, fearful of being excluded from the feast.
‘They literally threw themselves, screaming, into the struggling mass
of white, grey, and black feathers. As the birds were perfectly
394 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

tame and unafraid, there was a fair field for all, and I was sure
no gull flew away without some scrap to satisfy appetite. I was
informed that the bird feeding was held every morning at the
same hour, and that the hotel guests regarded the ceremony as one
of the attractions of the place.

More recently, in California, I began a similar practice, and
soon had an expectant colony to feed on the sandy shore near our
hotel. Quite a respectable collection of western and other gulls
gathered about 9.30 each morning, and when I appeared with a
bag of “ seconds,” some twenty or thirty birds rose to meet me and
circled about my head until I arrived at the feeding ground. Then
we had a sort of athletic “ meet.”

One of the first contests was staged by throwing into their midst
a large, hard, breakfast roll. This edible was forthwith seized by
a gull, who, unable to swallow it, at once made off, followed by
half a dozen others in search of a place of safety. The pursued and
the pursuers flew a fine aerial course; the bird, with its mouth full
of bread, often rising high in air, swooped, dodged, and doubled.
Finally, he broke away in a much wider circle than usual, intent on
tiring out his pursuers. However, all these maneuvers ended the
same way, in the dropping of the roll, to be caught up by a second
gull and the continuation of the flight and pursuit. Eventually
some experienced bird would grasp the breakfast dainty and fly
down the caast for half a mile or so until his pursuers abandoned
the chase. But I noticed on these occasions that the successful bird
did not return; his time for the subsequent half hour was occupied
in soaking the hard bread preparatory to tearing it in pieces small
enough for deglutition. Occasionally we substituted for the roll a
hard-boiled egg. This much-prized article was immediately caught up
and passed from one gull to another by vigorous action until it was
either smashed by falling on a rock or until some bird with an
abnormally wide gullet managed to swallow it. To accomplish
this latter feat while being chased at full speed seemed no easy
task; it is possible that it was sometimes accomplished only by
crushing the egg between the mandibles of a particularly powerful
gull.

After a time we came to recognize individuals of the flock. One
fat old bird we christened “Squawker.” As soon as one of us ap-
peared in sight this gull opened his mouth wide, emitted a series of
loud, hoarse cries, and darting at the other gulls in his immediate
vicinity proceeded to run amuck through the whole flock. This
strategem, intended, one may suppose, to intimidate the other
feeders, he repeated every two or three minutes while the feast
lasted. He rarely got anything to eat, however, unless food were
thrown directly to him; he was so busily engaged in squawking, air-
OCEANIA—WO0OOD 395

ing his importance, and in assaulting the neighbors that the other
culls, meantime, had all the advantage and ate all the provender.

Of the fifty or more species of gulls found all over the world, at
least thirty inhabit the Americas. It is difficult to explain their
complete absence from the immense ocean area between the South
American Continent and Australasia. It seemed as if we had missed
something when, after the crowds of gulls in San Francisco Harbor
and along the Pacific coast, we failed to see a single one during
the long journey to New Zealand. I presume little of the
food the birds crave is available in the lagoons and atolls of
Polynesia.

Although I have studied these birds in many lands, I have never
seen any of them catch fish after the manner of their cousins, the
terns. On one occasion I thought I saw a western gull light on the
water and pull out a fish, but of this I am by no means certain; the
bird gave me little opportunity for investigation, as he swallowed
his catch at once, without taking wing. Moreover, the prey may
have been a dead fish floating on or near the surface. I was, of
course, fairly well acquainted with the hawking habit of our laugh-
ing gull (Larus atricilla), as well as the Franklin and other species,
and have seen individuals of several of these hunting and catching
insects and even field mice, swooping after them almost with the
agility of sparrow hawks. In view of this lack of opportunity, I
was much interested in the account furnished by a writer in the con-
tributor’s column of a recent Atlantic of “gulls” (probably species
of booby) in South America that, unlike their northern relatives,
dive to a considerable depth for fish: “ These birds are very similar
to their cousins of the north; they are, though, less well groomed,
and do not look as sleek and nice as their northern neighbors. The
only noticeable difference is in the shape of the wing, which has a
decided break, and not the even beautiful curve of the wing that the
northern sea gull has. From my home in Valparaiso I have watched
these birds dive, and sometimes from a height of a hundred feet. It
is a peculiar thing that they do this in flocks rather than singly. A
most remarkable sight it is to watch—to see a hundred or more birds
turn, as if by one accord, close their wings and dive in after the fish.
A beautiful sight it is, too, to see a flock of sea gulls serenely circling
above the waters dive, to catch for a moment the flash of the white
feathers of their upturned wings in the sunlight, to see them strike
the water, and again to see them bob up one by one. Of note is it
that almost never did I see one return unrewarded.”

Did you ever notice a colony of gulls sitting quietly in the open?
If there is little or no wind, and the day is bright, they stand or lie,
either in a long line or in closer formation, facing the sun. And, by
the way, what a pretty sight—these smooth, well-groomed, statuesque,
396 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

half-white bodies, bathed in sunshine and artistically posed, as if for
our pleasure and admiration. If there is little sun and no wind,
they face in various directions; there is no uniformity in their ranks.
If there is a high wind, however, they turn toward the quarter
whence it blows, probably to prevent ruffling of their feathers and
cooling of the skin surface.

There must be a considerable difference between the acuity of
vision in gulls. I am not prepared at the moment to discuss this
matter, bat I have never been able to repeat an experiment I made
some years ago on the species—L. ridibundus, I think—that is
abundant on the Lake of Geneva. During excursions to Ouchy and
other resorts along the lake shore it was my habit to carry with me
a bag of grapes with which to feed the gulls. Parenthetically, all
the gulls whose acquaintance I have made are very fond of grapes.
I soon found that they would hawk the fruit when thrown one by
one into the air. I then tried to find how small an object could be
seen and caught in midair by these birds—to discover that the
smallest grape in my collection when tossed into the air was re-
trieved before it reached the water. I have not been able to repeat
that little experiment with any of our western or California gulls.

Referring once more to the black-headed gulls whose acquaintance
I cultivated at Ouchy nearly 20 years ago, they must not be mis-
taken for our black-headed or laughing ruth (LZ. atricilla). Both
are quite common birds within their respective ranges, but the Swiss
species is much smaller and its plumage more charged with black
than the American variety. Perhaps I was among the first of those
to whom my former teacher in the London Hospital, Sir Frederick
Treves, refers in his charming book, “The Lake of Geneva,” as
visitors “who have so persistently fed these (black-headed) gulls
that they are demoralized, and will shortly become, like the pigeons
of Venice, a company of tourist-supported idlers.”

As every mother knows, the color of her infant’s eyes undergoes
changes, more or less marked, during the first year or two after
birth; but these alterations are negligible when compared with the
eyes of some birds. For example, the very pretty, and often very
tame, little red-billed gull (in New Zealand, the mackerel gull) or
Larus scopulinus, is born with dark-brown, almost black eyes, and
yet by the time it is a year old they have changed almost to a pure
white. A similar alteration is noticeable in the iridic coloration of
the larger but equally beautiful southern black-backed gull (Larus
dominicanus), that ranges the whole Southern Hemisphere. Both
these birds are easily domesticated; they act as valuable scavengers,
and are devourers of caterpillars and other insect pests. It is inter-
esting to see them about Australasian harbors and fields, doing their
useful work, unafraid of man.

OCEANIA—W0OD 397

The vulgar name “bell bird” is given to many quite different
species in various parts of the world, but in every instance it is
applied because of the resemblance of the bird’s call note to the toll-
ing of a bell. I have already spoken about the representative of
these remarkable animals found in the northern parts of South
America and { was naturally on the look out for their Australasian
congeners. The New Zealand bird is a honey sucker—Anthornis
melanura—alas, fast becoming extinct. It was this remarkable bird
that attracted the attention of Captain Cook. On his second voyage
while his ship was lying in Queen Charloite’s Sound, the crew heard
bird notes “like small bells most exquisitely tuned.” On the Austra-
lian Continent two species, one also a honey sucker, Manorhina
melanophrys, and another, a shrike-like bird, are called bell birds.
Of the former Buller says, “Its notes, though simple, are varied and
sweetly chimed, and as the bird is of social habits, the morning
anthem, in which scores of the sylvan choristers perform together,
is a concert of eccentric parts, producing a wild but pleasing melody.
When alarmed or excited they utter a strain of notes which I can
compare only to the sound produced by a policeman’s rattle quickly
revolved. This cry, or the bird catcher’s imitation of it, never fails
to attract to the spot all the bell birds within hearing.”

One clear day I visited Quarantine Island, Auckland Harbor, as
the guest of the chief engineer of the harbor board, Mr. W. H.
Hamer, himself a keen and well-informed naturalist. We found
there many birds that I had no expectation of seeing, among them
many bell birds. The ordinary song of the New Zealand species re-
sembles that of the parson bird, and while we sat listening to what
seemed to me to be a sustained song a discussion took place among
' the ornithologists present as to whether the avian music we were
hearing was that of a tui or not. A portion of the song certainly
recalls the notes of a bell, and it has a metallic ring about it that
serves to distinguish the call notes of the New Zealand bell bird
from the sustained and softer song of the tui, but neither of them
in any respect suggests the solemn tolling of the South American
bird, with his single though prolonged note. The Australian chorus
of performers reminds one of a chime, or of several mingled chimes,
of small, silver-tongued bells, while the New Zealand performers
make one think of the rendering of a musical number by minor brass
instruments. Anthornis melanura is smaller than our robin (male,
length, 7.5 inches; female, 6.4 inches), color generally ight yellowish
green in the case of the male bird, but this must be modified by
stating that the head is.steel-colored, while the tail is brownish black.
The female is browner and less conspicuous, but both sexes are
equally good singers.
398 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

To distinguish the two Australian varieties, Manorhina melano-
phrys is called bell minor. Unlike the nearly pure white Guiana
bell bird, Chasmorynchus niveus (of a different family), it is of a
beautiful golden green plumage, except the wings and tail, which are
dark brown. The eyes are dark brown, the legs and feet a light
orange. In the case of this bird the notes seemed to me a faint tin-
kle, like the sound of distant sheep bells. I heard a flock of 50 of
these remarkable birds give a charming concert about a little lake
20 miles from Melbourne.

Mr. H. RB. Haeusler (Emu, vol. 22, January, 1923) has had unusual
oppportunities to study the kiwi (Apteryw mantel), and finds his
vision, during the daytime at least, to be very poor. Chopped meat,
worms, etc., placed in front of these wingless, nocturnal, New Zea-
land birds were apparently not perceived at all until they had been
“felt” by the supersensitive terminals of their long mandibles.
Both these articles of food, as well as the entrances to worm holes,
were located by “tapping” about with their closed bills. Mr. Haeus-
ler is convinced that in gathering food and for most other purposes
involving localization, neither sight nor smell is to any extent relied
upon; the bird locates objects mainly, and in many instances en-
tirely, by touch. Having found the entrance to & worm hole, the
kiwi enlarges it to a funnel-shaped cavity and, after grasping the
prey, pulls steadily upon the worm until the latter is tired out,
looses its hold, and is drawn to the surface. If alarmed, the Ap-
teryx “plays possum,” and with bill stuck into the ground keeps as
still as death, its peculiar coloring making it difficult to see the bird
as long as it does not move—the old story of protective coloration.
From my own observations of this remarkable species I am con-

vinced that its night vision is much better than its diurnal, as indi- -

cated by its liveliness at night and its pronounced orange-red
fundus, which closely resembles that of the owls and other noc-
turnal Species. I had several opportunities of observing these birds
and of examining their eyes in the London Zoo. .
Many writers tell us all about the Polynesian hermit crab, and some
of them speak as if he were peculiar to Oceania. As is well known,
this comic and attractive animal is widely distributed over the
earth’s surface under the forbidding family names of Paguridae and
Parapaguridae; indeed, more than one (small) species is rather com-
mon along the Atlantic coast. The following is what one of our
most reliable authors tells us about this creature: “The hermit crab
is the best bait for fishing in the waters of the South Sea islands.
There must be several varieties. I have counted three already: The
ordinary, small brown one called kakara, the huge red one found in
deep water, and the black, hairy kind, whose pounded-up body is
mixed with grated coconut to extract the oil. This latter is called

42 pte eee ere eth
OCEANIA—-WOOD 399

Unga; in the old days the lowest class of Rarotonga society was
known by the same name, meaning, i. e., that all their property could
be carried on their backs. The common variety is a good deal like
the robber crab in habits; the natives go so far as to say that it is
the same animal. The size of the kakara can be judged by the size
of his shell, which may be as small as a thimble or as large as an
orange. His soft and muscular body curls into the spiral of the
shell and is securely anchored by a twist of the tail. The interior
end reminds one of a tiny lobster; the same stalk eyes, same legs,
and strong claws. Maugre his name, he is gregarious.”

One day I was patiently and vainly waiting to catch a glimpse
of an exasperating lot of wild jungle fowl (near relatives of the
ancestors of our farmyard rooster and hen) that I had heard cack-
ling and crowing in the mountain forest of Beqa (or Mbenga, as
the Admiralty charts prefer to spell it, so the stranger may correctly
pronounce the name of this geographically important island) and
had come to rest on a trail about a thousand feet above and over-
looking the ocean. Beneath me a little native village, whose chief
was our host, lay scattered along a coral beach for half a mile.
Barely visible over the edge of the cliff was the chief’s guest house
and a small weir in which was imprisonea a huge turtle for his
chiefly table; turtle is taboo for any Fijian below the rank of Bult.
Until the chief had, a few days previously, sent four as a present
to the quadrennial conference of chiefs, the watery inclosure was
pretty well filled with these ugly but toothsome chelonians. Beyond
lay the bay, and basking in the sunshine on three native boats
sprawled a dozen or more sailors, among them two or three Solomon
Islanders assisting the Fijians in a task in which the latter special-
ized, the South Seas form of the dolce far niente. The day was so
beautiful that I forgot all about the “wild barnyard” I had
come so far to see, and gave myself up to imitating and sympathiz-
ing with the Polynesians in and on the water below me. I happened
to look at the partially covered path a few yards ahead of me and
became aware dimly that the square of earth was moving ever so
slowly down hill. A clearer view of this spot revealed a well-packed
array of shellfish of all sizes, big, little, and smallest, the last less
than half an inch, the first 4 or 5 inches across. Evidently a num-
ber of gastropod families were on the move and headed down the
trail. This guess proved correct so far as the exterior shell was con-
cerned, but the live interior turned out to be an equal number of
crustaceans—a large colony of hermit crabs on the march. With a
stick I touched several heads to see them withdrawn within the concha,
and marveled at the excellent choice these creatures had made of
properly sized shells, how well they fitted, how nicely concealed was
each interloping crab in his armored retreat, secure from outside
400 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

enemies. It is probable that, in some instances at least, the crab
first attacks and then eats the mollusk whose shell he afterwards
appropriates.

Engaged in these investigations, I did not notice, partly concealed
as he was by the pathside vegetation, a figure that made me laugh
and continue to laugh. As this, the largest of the crabs, crawled out
of the herbage into the cleared trail I saw that he was not garbed in
appropriate dress. Instead of the outworn shell affected by all his
companions, he was girt about by a segment of coconut that covered
only part of his body, much as the conventional, unclothed tramp is
pictured as veiling his nakedness by means of a flour barrel. Indeed,
the old crab looked like a disreputable “drunk” as he staggered
along in his ancient, broken, and weather-beaten nut shell. It was,
of course, no fault of his that the sea gastropods on Bega did not
grow large enough to furnish shelter and to meet the exigencies of
adult fashion in dress. However, he kept step with the moving
ranks, the ill-clad hermit forming the rear guard, staggering along
until he was the only crab in sight. Then with a final wave of his
antennx, as if in jaunty adieu, he rolled his shabby old shell into
the leafy débris of the forest and disappeared from my sight.

In the harbor of Apia lay H. M. S. Laburnum of the New Zealand

Navy, and just before we sailed for Tonga there was transferred to
us from her a more or less tame, immature, female Fregata aquila.
The bird was destined to the Auckland Zoo, and the story ran that
some officer on the warship had bought it, a captive of some months
standing, from a native of Hull Island in the Phoenix group. He,
or rather, if my guess should turn out to be correct, she, soon became
an object of considerable interest to the passengers. From her com-
paratively lofty perch on the gunwale of the lifeboat that was set
apart as her living room she gazed with unconcern at the admiring
crowd below. Many times a day she scrambled from the depths of
the lifeboat to preen herself, especially after a shower, and to dry
and air her immense wings in the tropical sunshine. The ignomini-
ous part of the performance was that it was necessary to tie the bird
by one leg to the thwarts, and the restraining rope embarrassed her
efforts to perch and spread her wings, owing to her weak legs and
her immense wings; and it certainly was a beautiful sight to see her
magnificent wing spread of not less than 6 feet. The officer who
had the new arrival in charge certainly did all he could to make
Fregata comfortable, provided her with a box into which she retired
whenever she wished, gave her all the fish she could eat and all the
water she could drink. In deference to the positive statements of
a passenger, who proclaimed himself an authority on man-of-war
birds, she was provided daily with a can of sea water, that being the
proper drink for this ocean-going fowl. As this dictum sounded
OCEANIA—WOOD 401

much like the ancient belief that parrots should never be given
water to drink—an obsession that has caused so much misery in the
psittacine world—I determined to investigate it. And sooner than
1 expected the opportunity arrived, because shortly we had a tropi-
cal downpour that thoroughly drenched the bird and her surround-
ings. It was good to watch the Fregata for the half hour the storm
lasted. She certainly enjoyed her bath, spreading wide her long,
pointed pinions to allow the cool douche to reach the hot skin of her
sides and underparts. Now and then she would flap her wings to
shake off superfluous water, but she did not retire to her box or make
any other effort to avoid a full bath. But the way in which that
bird drank rain water! For at least 10 minutes she did nothing
else—opening wide a capacious mouth to catch the drops that not
only fell directly into the orifice but that ran down the sides of the
mandibles. First she opened her beak, then pointed it aloft, as if
trying to drink in as much of the falling water as possible, and when
she had secured all her throat would hold made evident swallowing
movements. ‘There could be no doubt that for this bird at least soft
water was a desirable beverage; and I can readily believe that in the
upper air, where her folks spend most of their time, this perform-
ance may go on without the necessity of resting on the waves or of
roosting on dry land. I never saw the man-o’-war preen herself in
the sense that so many other birds are wont to do. I have an idea
that the very large birds do not, as a rule, indulge in that method of
feather cleansing. I have noticed the large birds of prey, herons
anhingas, etc., proceed, as our Fregata did, that is, shake their wings
and body and then sit in the sun and dry themselves after a torren-
tial shower bath or plunge. After this thorough wetting Fregata
seemed content to hold her wings semiextended, to flap them now
and then, and to shake herself, dog-like, every two or three minutes,
and then to let the warm sun do the rest.

Every day I climbed to the bird’s retreat invariably to find that she
appeared to have made herself entirely at home and was not at all
alarmed by the approach of strangers. The most hostile act she
was guilty of was to make a sort of grunting noise and open her
beak at the intruder. As she was taken from the nest (probably,
that is) and tamed by association with a native family, the chances
of becoming reconciled to captivity in a public zoo are good; yet
these birds make very poor cage birds, generally dying of home-
sickness, or the infections induced thereby, within a short time.
The feathered animal whose home is the illimitable blue sky soon
sickens even of the largest flight aviary and, though he may be
only a robber and live by piracy, yet he prefers death to loss of
-freedom.

There are few or no monkeys (or for that matter few other
mammals) in eastern Polynesia. Perhaps the earlier voyagers
from the mainland had not learned to carry them as pets, like many
other native tribes, on their long sea excursions, or they did not
survive the exposure incident to canoe life. In any event, it is
not until one reaches islands relatively near the Asiatic coast—
Borneo, New Guinea, Java, the Celebes—that simian life becomes
abundant. It is quite otherwise with the West Indies, where even
to the present day monkeys are to be seen in some of the islands.

As every ichthyologist knows, not all the so-called flying fishes
belong to the same genus or even to the same family. In one or
other of their many forms they are found all over the oceanic world.
The true flying fish—perhaps we say true because it is the commonest
Atlantic variety—is E'wocoetus volitans. Following the flag (1 sup-
pose), it is also to be seen volplaning in Hawaiian waters. In this
species the pectoral fins are as long as its body. To round cut the
collection of American fliers, we have the largest of all the species,
Exocoetus californicus (vel Cypselurus californicus)—the great flying
fish, 18 inches long—inhabiting the coastal tides of California. It
is also appropriate that the zoologist who knows most about these
piscian wonders should be David Starr Jordan, of Stanford Uni-
versity. The flight mechanism and methods studied by him and his
former assistants, Professors Gilbert and Evermann, are briefly as
follows: “'The flying fish of the open sea live in schools, and ‘fly’
a distance of a few rods to an eighth of a mile, rarely rising more
than 3 or 4 feet out of the water. Their movements in the water are
very rapid, and from this alone do they gain the force that impels
them through the air. The apparent vibration of the pectorals in
the air does not to any appreciable extent aid their progress over
the water. On rising from the surface the movements of the tail
are continued until the whole body is out of the water. The vibra-
tion of the pectorals is not a truly flying movement, but is due to
the resistance of the air itself. In the water both ventrals are
folded; when in air both pectorals and ventrals are spread to act
as parachutes or wings to hold the body in air. When the fish begins
to fall, and its tail touches the water, the tail again begins to move,
enabling it once more to resume flight. In full flight the fish takes
advantage of the wind, turning about to fly with the favoring
breeze.”

Although I have rather carefully watched flying fish on several
oceans and tidal rivers I have never been fortunate enough to see
them “fly,” i. e., use their lateral fins as a means of progression
through the air. Once I saw a school of freshwater flying fish 100
miles up a tropical river, but they belonged to a different genus,
and perhaps order, than Z'xocoetus. During this journey into the

OCEANIA—W0OO0OD 403

interior of South America my four companions and I watched and
discussed the movements of these small, sunfish-shaped skimmers
of the river surface. They .did not “ fly ” in the air so much as they
skipped over the calm water of use Potaro in a perfectly straight
line for from 5 to 20 yards by a sculling motion of the tail. The
fore part of the rounded abdomen also rested on the surface and
seemed to furnish some support as the fish scudded along. Doctor
Gifford, who watched many of these fish very critically, feels certain
that he never saw one, on that journey, rise free of the water and
actually “fly ” through the air, like Hwocoetus. On the other hand,
he believes he has seen Cypselurus californicus use his pectorals, like
a huge dragon fly, as an actual propeller. He has not seen them
fly more than 100 yards and then not more than 2 or 3 feet above
the waves.

I have discussed this matter with many observers, in particular
with an old sea captain interested in natural history who had for
hours at a time watched flying fish all over the world. He placed
the limit of flight in any species he had seen at 200 yards, and the
highest point of their trajectory at 4 feet. Auit (Geographic Maga-
zine, Dec. 1922, p. 642) agrees with Gifford in believing that some
of these fish are able to continue flight, changing direction and going
much farther than momentum alone could carry them. He claims
that the vibrations of the wing fins have been seen frequently by
several observers.

Another authority, Doctor Hankin, is of opinion (Nature, Aug.
18, 1921) that although at the beginning of their glide they may flap
their large triangular pectorals a few times and though they vary
the position and planes of part or the whole of their transport fins,
as the soaring hawk curls and arranges his wings to take advantage
of a favoring wind or air current, yet it is the propulsion out of the
water and the succeeding glide that constitute the so-called flight of
the flying fish; they do not fly as birds do. The mechanism of this
locomotion has, as every naturalist knows, been discussed innumer-
able times in literature like its analogous process, the soaring of the
hawk or vulture.

In Barbados I had an opportunity of seeing the fisher boys catch
the variety that abounds on that island coast. They are a dark-
backed, trout-like species about 10 inches in length, their pectorals
attached to the bodies like the gossamer wings of huge dragon flies.
They also gave one the impression of a folded fan with little rudder-
like accessories. I saw how these fish are caught in that particular
part of the island. They are first attracted by pieces of meat—often
distinctly odorous—inclosed in a wicker container which is “jiggled”
up, and down in the water from the stern of the fisherman’s boat.
The fish thus enticed are landed by means of a dip or other net.
404 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Capt. John Bollons, master of the Government steamship 7’utanaki
and a naturalist of local repute, told me that during his thirty years
of service in the South Pacific he had made a considerable study of
flying fishes, and that he had often seen the large flying fish (Cypse-
lurus melanocercus) rise as much as 6 feet clear of the water and
without again touching it volplane (the captain would not say “fly”)
a quarter of a mile. On many occasions he had observed them
“bank” and vary their direction as often as three times on each
occasion and as much as 30°-40° during the night.

An officer of the mercantile marine, whose powers of observation
I regard as worthy of consideration, tells me that he has often caught
one of the Pacific flying fishes on board his ship, and that they can fly
to a deck even to 10 feet from the water level. They usually “fly”
on board at night, and he thinks they are attracted by the lights of
the vessel. In proof of the latter statement he points to the method
of catching them in Polynesia, by means of the flare on a canoe and
a dip net. But why does the light attract the fish? Quien sabe?

Having quoted some recent literature on this apparently obscure
subject, suppose we listen to what Adriaan van Beckel has to say
about it. He sailed to South America from Holland nearly 250
years ago, and in his “American Voyages” tells many interesting
stories about the flora and fauna he studied in his travels. Recently,
my friend, Dr. Walter Roth, of Christianburg, British Guiana, an
author well known to students of Indian folklore, translated this
charming Dutch work, and the following quotation is from his origi-
nal manuscript, which he was good enough to present to the writer.
“As regards the flying fish, we saw various shoals raise themselves in
flight to the height of about 8 or 10 feet, and cover 50 or 60 paces be-
fore they fell again into the water to moisten their wings, and acquire
renewed strength against the bonitos (implacable cannibal fish that
are always chasing the flying fish and driving them to seek refuge in
aerial flights), who sometimes catch them as they fall or spring out
of the water and grab them as they fly. Besides bonitos, the flying
fish have yet another enemy, being a certain kind of bird, which
shoots dewn on them as they fly out of the water to save themselves
from the bonitos. Our constable brought me the first flying fish
which, followed by one of the said birds near by, happened to fall
into our ship. It was of the shape, color, and size of a herring, the
back a little bit thicker, and the extreme front of the head roundish,
like a sea bream, with the wings above the belly—very like a bat’s.”

For the naturalist the chief attraction that Niuafoou in the Ton-
gan group holds is its “ Malau,” one of the several species of Mega-
podes that have preserved their reptilian habits to the extent of
laying their eggs in the sand of the sea shore and allowing the hot
sun to do the hatching.’ When I was in Nukualofa, the capital of
OCEANIA—WO0OOD 405

Tonga, Dr. C. M. Dawson, chief of the medical service and all-
around scientist, gave me one of the eggs of this curious bird. This
specimen is of a purple-brown color, an egg twice as large as the
average hen’s egg, the bird that laid it being smaller than the average
hen. The Malau resembles closely the Celebes species (Jfegacepha-
lon maleo) described by Alfred Wallace in his “ Malay Archipelago.”
“It is,” says he, “in loose, hot, black sand that the maleos deposit
their eggs. In the months of August and September, when there
is little or no rain, they come down in pairs from the interior to
certain favorite spots and scratch holes 3 or 4 feet deep, just above
high-water mark, where the female deposits a single large egg,
which she covers with about a foot of sand, and then returns to the
forest. At the end of 10 or 12 days she comes again to the same
spot to lay another egg, and each female is supposed to lay 6 or 5
eggs during the season. The male assists in making the hole, coming
down and returning with her. The appearance of the bird when
walking on the beach is very handsome. The glossy black and rosy
white of the plumage, the helmeted head, and elevated tail, like that
of the common fowl, gives a striking character. * * * The eggs
are so large that it is not possible for the body of the bird to contain
more than one fully developed egg at a time. After the eggs are
deposited in the sand they are no further cared for by the mother.
The young birds on breaking the shell work their way up through
the sand and run off at once to the forest.” Knowlton adds to the
foregoing (Birds of the World, p. 270): “That the nesting habits
of these Megapodes are admirably adapted to the structure and pres-
ent life of the birds is beyond question; but how these habits could
have originated in the first place is difficult to understand. Under
present conditions, if the birds were required to incubate their eggs,
serious difficulties would arise. With an interval of 10 or 12 days
between the laying of each egg, a period of some two or three months
would elapse between the first and the last egg. If the eggs were
left until the last was laid, the first ones would be subject to climatic
injuries as well as destruction by predatory animals; while if the
female began incubation with the laying of the first egg, it would
require her to remain sitting for three months, which would be
impossible. It has been suggested that these nesting habits may be
the survival of a habit enjoyed by a remote reptilian ancestor, but
this is too improbable. Others think that it arose from the birds
covering ‘up and concealing their eggs, which seems not unreason-
able; yet if this is true, it is difficult to see how they could have
become developed to the point where the young can fly from the time
of exit from the shell.”

406 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

The parrots of Fiji are renowned among ornithologists and they
have often been described in the literature of natural history, even
if they are not quite as popular among colonial planters because of
their love of such forbidden fruits as bananas, coconuts, and paw-
paws. Surely, however, something can be forgiven such lovely
creatures. Perhaps the most elaborately decorated of them all is
the Yellow-breasted Parrot (Pyrrhulopsis personatus), 22 inches
in length. He is probably much rarer than he was twenty years
ago. I was unable to locate a single caged specimen among the
hundreds of pet parrots to be found on the various islands, although
I inserted a request in the Fiji Times and Herald asking owners
of the yellowbreast to allow me to see their pets. In several in-
stances I discovered that this fine bird had been caught and tamed
but had died after a caged or confined life varying from five to
fifteen years. Their places were not filled because no young parrots
were on the market. It is quite different with the crimson-breasted
species from Kandavu. Here the beautiful Pyrrhulopsis splendens,
although unprotected by law (on account of his fruit-eating propen-
sities), easily holds his own in spite of the large numbers captured
and sold by the natives to tourists and others.

Although not as elaborately decorated as the yellowbreast, P.
splendens is a very attractive species, whose length is 18 to 20
inches, with the head and all the upper surface crimson; across the
nape a wide, deep-blue band; back, rump, upper-tail coverts, and
wings bright green; primaries and their coverts, as well as the
outer secondary feathers, blue; lastly, as a striking contrast, the
eyes are deep orange. It is a question whether this species was not
at one time confined to Kandavu and whether the individuals found
on Viti Levu, for example, were not introduced from the former
island. Be that as it may, wild examples are rare outside Kandavu.
This one of the four Pyrrhulopses is the favorite cage bird in the
colony, not only because of the abundant supply of young birds but
because of its talking powers, display of affection, and intelligence,
and because it practically never screams nor makes other disagree-
able noises when in captivity. Although their rather shrill mono-
tone is a common sound in the Kandavan forest, these birds seem
to abandon loud notes when in captivity. They are fair talkers
and whistlers, but in exhibiting these accomplishments do not make
themselves a nuisance to the neighborhood, as do some of the other .
large parrots.

Some years ago the Samoans were in the habit of making ex-
cursions to Fiji to shoot “kakas” and other birds of bright plum-
age, that they might weave the feathers into their mats. It is also
said that they were not averse to trapping or buying live birds
OCEANIA—-WOOD 407

that they might pluck regular crops of feathers from the unfor-
tunate parrots. This cruel practice continued until the arrival in
the colony, as governor, of that sympathetic and well-known
naturalist, Sir Everard im Thurn, who put an end to the scandal.
The large Fijian parrots built their nests in hollow trees, and gen-
erally 20 or 30 feet from the ground. I discovered one nest in a
decayed stump less than 5 feet high. The central hole was 8 inches
across and the nest was a very primitive affair, consisting only of
the débris that had accumulated in the bottom of the excavation.
There were three, nearly round, dirty-brown eggs which, when
cleansed, became uniformly white. They measured 1,°; by 1% inches.

The other species of this interesting genus are peculiar to (or the
types hail from) Taviuni, Vanua Levu, and Koro, respectively. They
differ from the Kandavan variety mainly in the amount of blue on
the nape of the neck, it being entirely absent in the first mentioned
and seen only as an inconspicuous streak in the other two.

In about 1 per cent of the long-tailed Fijian parrots cases of
heterochrosis occur; that is, the red, green, and blue feathers in the
birds’ plumage to_a greater or less extent change to yellow and
white. Although this color alteration is abnormal it frequently is
seen in perfectly healthy subjects of great intelligence and vivacity.
Moreover, the alternations often result in color combinations far
surpassing in attractiveness the plumage tints of the normal parrot.

The chief glory of Fiji’s avifauna undoubtedly lies in her wild
fruit pigeons and doves, several of which are found only on the
islands of the group. The nutmeg pigeon, so called from its favorite
diet, is Globicera pacifica, with an iridescent, wine-colored plumage
and a remarkable stomach lined with horny spines to grind off and
pulpify the arillus or “mace” from the wild nutmegs on which
he chiefly subsists. The equally beautiful Chili piegon, or ruve,
Janthoenas vitiensis, flourishes on red-hot capsicums.

Of the wonderfully feathered little fruit doves much has been
written ; indeed it is quite impossible to describe their gorgeous color-
ing; they must be seen to be appreciated. Male and female are
quite differently feathered in all the species, the male golden dove
(Chrysaena luteovirens) having an olive-yellow cap fringed with
yellowish, the remainder of the body being mostly clothed in a
covering of lovely, separated, glossy, lanceolated, golden feathers.
He has a yellow-green tail; while the female is greenish through-
out; indeed, goes under the popular name of the green dove.

Then, there is the crimson-capped dove (Ptilinopus perousez) that
looks white as it flies, but is really a remarkable study in dark
purple, bronze-green and white, the first and last colors predominat-
ing. This beautiful dove sports a crimson cape over his shoulders
A408 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

and the white feathers of his breast are split at their ends, the re-
sulting points being tipped with red. The female is less elaborately
adorned but is yet extremely attractive.

Still more wonderful in its truly flamboyant attire is the far-
famed, through rare, flame-colored or orange dove (Chrysaena
victor), whose flight through the forest has been aptly likened to
“the passage of a rocket on a dark night.” The male bird has a
velvety, olive-colored cap with a bright yellow border, the rest of
the body-covering, both above and below, being composed of closely
applied, hair-like feathers of a brilliant, glossy orange-red; “ flame-
colored” describes it more accurately. The entire plumage of the
female is rich green; yellowish-green on the head and throat. I
have never seen a more impressive study in feathered monochrome
than is presented by this beautiful little dove. Finally, one of the
most attractive of these Columbiformes is the Fijian ground dove
(Gallicolumba stairi vitiensis), intermediate in size and, perhaps,
beauty between the smaller doves and the larger pigeons. The gen-
eral coloration of this species is dark brown with bronze and purple
reflections. He has a genuine “coo” as his call note, and is still to
be found in those localties that are free of the mongoose. In Viti
Levu some individuals still survive. They have learned to avoid
ground feeding as much as possible, and to build on the small
branches of high trees to which the enemy can not climb. A notice-
able character of some of these Fijian birds is their “barking”
notes—those of the golden dove in particular. In the deep jungle
one is often startled. by a succession of clear or hoarse dog-like
sounds, so familiar that if one does not know their origin they are
readily attributed to a dog that has strayed from home.
HISTORICAL TRADITION AND ORIENTAL RESEARCH *

By JAMES HENRY BREASTED
University of Chicago

It has often been remarked that the outstanding trait of the
untrained mind is credulity. The rationalization of man’s views
of the world has been a very slow process and it is still very far
from a completed process. It has commonly been thought to have
begun with the Greeks, but its origin must be sought in the Orient
in a period long before Greek civilization had arisen. The Edwin
Smith Medical Papyrus, acquired in 1906 by the New York His-
torical Society, discloses the inductive process of scientific investiga-
tion already in operation in the seventeenth century before Christ.
For example, this document contains the earliest occurrence of the
word “ brain” anywhere appearing in surviving records of the past.
The word is unknown in Old Testament Hebrew, in Babylonian,
Assyrian,,or any of the ancient languages of Western Asia. The
organ itself, therefore, was evidently discovered and the recogni-
tion of its various functions was begun forthe first time by these
physicians of early Egypt in the thousand years preceding the seven-
teenth century B. C. The observations recorded in the Edwin
Smith Medical Papyrus show that its author had already observed
that control of the members and limbs of the body was localized in
different sides of the brain; and the recognition of localization of
functions in the brain, mostly the work of modern surgeons within
a generation or two, had already begun in the seventeenth century
B. C., at a time when all Europe still lay in savagery or barbarism.

I hold in my hand part of an original transit instrument, made
as stated by the inscription upon it, by no less a king than Tutenkh-
amon, in the fourteenth century B. C. It did not come from the
tomb of Tutenkhamon, but was apparently made by him for the
tomb of his (or his wife’s) great-grandfather, Thutmose IV (fif-
teenth century B. C.). This and another such piece now at Berlin,
are the oldest scientific instruments of any kind now known to be

surviving. It was used for determining meridian time, especially at
night, in order that the observer might then set his water clock, with
its 24-hour divisions—a division of the day which thence passed over
into Europe in Hellenistic times, whence it was transmitted to us.

Now Herodotus reports a tradition current in his day (fifth cen-
tury B. C.), that the Greeks were greatly indebted to Egyptian
knowledge. This tradition has in recent times been universally re-
jected; but the documents submitted here to-day may serve at least
to illustrate the fact that there was much truth in the tradition trans-
mitted to us by Herodotus, and that its complete rejection by classical
prejudice is unjustifiable.

The fact that the early Egyptian scientist employed an inductive
method as far back as the seventeenth century B. C. does not, how-
ever, mean that he had completely banished from his mind all
belief in magic or in supernatural forces. This truth has been well
demonstrated for later ages by Prof. Lynn Thorndyke in his monu-
mental two volumes on the History of Magic and Experimental
Science—a work of which America may well be proud. Undoubt-
edly the Greek took the longest step in freeing his mind from in-
herited religious and traditional prepossessions. Using astronomical
observations undoubtedly drawn from Babylonia, Thales predicted
a solar eclipse in 585 B. C. Astonishing as it seemed to the Greeks,
there is little probability that this feat was an unprecedented
achievement. What was unprecedented, however, was the revolu-
tionary generalization which Thales based upon his ability to make
such a prediction. For he banished the erratic whims of the gods
from the skies and discerned the sway of natural law throughout the
celestial world. ‘To tear away and fearlessly to trample underfoot
beliefs and superstitions which had been sanctified by age-long re-
ligious veneration demanded dauntless loyalty to his own intelli-
gence. This first supreme enthronement of the human mind was
probably the greatest achievement in the career of man.

We can pay no greater tribute to such Greek thinkers than to
recognize that, although they put credulity to rout, they could not
banish it altogether. It has survived with extraordinary persist-
ence down to the present day, even appearing in the person of a dis-
tinguished statesman who once occupied high office in this city. * * *

In modern times it was of course the tremendous significance of
the discoveries of Galileo which most impressively reproclaimed the
supremacy of natural law and the sovereignty of the human mind
in discerning that law. In this new home of science * which we are
now dedicating, there is nothing which more nobly illustrates its

high mission than the dramatic power with which Lawrie’s immortal
bronze discloses the simple and dauntless figure of Galileo confront-
ing theological dogma with the majestic facts of the universe.

From Galileo’s struggle with the church to Huxley’s debate with
Gladstone, the heavy guns of natural science have dealt tradition
one destructive blow after another. It has been under this destruc-
tive attack at the hands of natural science that historical criticism
has grown up in modern times since Niebuhr. Indeed it has been no
accident that in our own country the first serious discussion of the
Old Testament narratives in Genesis and Exodus was written by
Thomas Cooper, who was the associate of Priestley in the discovery
of oxygen. Cooper was Thomas Jefferson’s appointee as first presi-
dent of the new University of Virginia; but in the Virginia of
that period the social feeling against Cooper for having assailed the
literalistic interpretation of the Old Testament was so strong that
Jefferson was unable to secure his induction into office. Jefferson’s
influence, however, secured Cooper’s appointment as president of the
University of South Carolina, where public opinion was at first not
so strong against him as in Virginia. It is interesting to note that
before the end of the twenties, that is less than a century ago, con-
servative sentiment was strong enough to bring about Cooper’s dis-
missal from the university, although his personal popularity was
such that he was promptly appointed to codify the laws of the State,
and the first legal code of the State of South Carolina was edited by
this gifted representative of natural science and historical criticism.

The merciless critical scalpel which had not spared Hebrew tra-
dition was equally unsparing in its treatment of the cherished clas-
sical heritage from Greece and Rome. The tales of Romulus and Re-
mus, the Trojan War and the entire cycle of legends which were linked
with it, were shorn away. A critical attitude of universal negation
arose. It included the whole Mediterranean and oriental world:
Rome, Greece, Hebrews, Babylonians, Assyrians, and Egyptians.
Historical criticism would not allow that early man at the beginning
of the age of writing had ever heard and transmitted an echo from
earlier ages, which, because they possessed no writing, could only
send on their story in the form of oral traditions. This attitude of
the historical critic may be compared with that of an observer who
stands on a mountain peak, and looking off across a distant land-
scape to a dim horizon shrouded in mists and cloud, insists that the
intermittent glimpses of mountain profiles which vaguely emerge
on the far-away skyline can not correspond to any reality. In short,
without ever having been himself on the ground to investigate, he
denies the existence of the phantom mountains on the horizon.
412 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

The orientalist, if he be something more than a philologist, may
be compared with the explorer who pushes out to that distant hori-
zon, and is able to determine on the ground whether the phantom
mountains really exist. Such investigation is, however, relatively
recent and the historical critic could hardly anticipate that it was
coming. He seemed to be quite safe in sweeping away all early
human tradition. It dealt with a world of gods, demi-gods and
heroes; it was dominated by the whims and caprices of angry or
jealous divinities, and it was filled with impossible wonders and
prodigies. How could a soundly critical historian accept narratives
which seemed so manifestly impossible? We must grant that under
the circumstances rejection complete and unqualified seemed the only
safe course.

Such critical negation was supreme when 50 years ago arche-
ology began to reveal with startling vividness the facts and the daily
equipment of human life in the very ages with which the rejected
traditions dealt. In the seventies of last century the excavations of
an untrained observer from the outside disclosed an astonishing
vision of pre-Greek civilization at Tiryns, Mycenae, and Troy. The
incredulity with which these discoveries of Heinrich Schliemann
were greeted by the classicists was highly characteristic. His exca-
vations recovered and exhibited to the incredulous eyes of the de-
structive critics the whole material equipment of daily life from the
very age of the Trojan war (or wars), and from the very city in and
around which that war was waged.

Similar revelations, involving far earlier periods of time, rapidly
disclosed the successive stages of the human career from a remote
antiquity, reaching well back of the beginnings of the world as dated
by an alleged “ Biblical” chronology. In dealing with the traditions
of these earlier ages, the orientalists soon developed a similar school
of negative criticism. Such traditional accounts were promptly
thrown into the discard. Maspero’s bulky history of the oriental
peoples, still a standard work on most modern library shelves, tells
us that Menes, the first king of the First Dynasty of Egypt, was a
purely mythical or legendary figure. Nevertheless we now possess
his tomb, and in our collections at the University of Chicago we
have a piece of his personal ornaments, a gold bar bearing his name
in hieroglyphic—the oldest piece of inscribed jewelry in existence.
Since 1894 thousands of prehistoric graves have been excavated
along the margin of the Nile Valley, revealing to us the successive
stages of human advance for many centuries before the once legend-
ary Menes.

Much the same process is going on in the investigation of Baby-
lonian history. Even the mythical hero Gilgamesh, the original of

ORIENTAL RESEARCH—BREASTED 413

the European Hercules, bids fair to emerge at last as a remote city
king of early Babylonia, who gained a reputation for his prowess in
war till he became the typical and proverbial strong man of all ages.

The crowning disclosure in this unprecedented series of un-
expected revelations has just come from Asia Minor. Nearly 20
years ago the German Assyriologist, Hugo Winckler, visited the
mounds of Boghaz (or Boghaz Ké6i—* Boghaz village”) in central
Asia Minor. As he walked over the ruins he kicked up with his
boot heel several cuneiform tablets, lying practically on the surface.
Below were piled the clay tablet archives of the Hittite Foreign
Office, the earliest of which had been lying here at the capital of the
Hittite Empire since the middle of the second thousand years before
Christ. The result has been the decipherment of ancient Hittite or
rather a whole group of Hittite dialects. The Great War has inter-
vened and since Winckler’s death the progress of examining this
enormous body of archives has unavoidably been very slow. We
owe a great debt especially to Hrozny and Forrer for the invaluable
disclosures which they have wrung from these documents.

One of these tablets reports a war of Atreus, King of Achaia
against the king of Caria at about the middle of the thirteenth cen-
tury, that is about 1250 B. C. There can be no doubt that in this
tablet we have a contemporary reference to the cycle of Trojan
wars—a reference which must be regarded as an irreproachable
historical source, as old as the events which it records. Thus out of
the lost oriental background of Greek history in Asia Minor comes
a written document confirming a Greek tradition, born in an age
when the Greeks themselves still lacked writing. Because writing
reaches further back in the orient by nearly three thousand years
than it does in Greece, we are therefore able to confirm Greek tra-
dition out of contemporary written sources.

It has long been recognized that in the early development of
Greek civilization the cities of Asia Minor took the lead. Thales,
who lived in one of these cities, was an example of this early stage
of Greek culture in Asia Minor. It is“also evident that the inland
background of oriental culture contributed much to this early de-
velopment of Greek civilization on the western fringes of Asia. It
is out of this newly recovered oriental background that we are
slowly regaining the earlier forerunners of Greek civilization.

This contemporary reference to the Trojan war is an epoch-mak-
ing revelation, which must react powerfully upon our treatment of
early human traditions. It at once demonstrates that such tradi-
tions must not be thrown to the scrap heap, but rather carefully di-
vested of gods and goddesses, prodigies and wonders, and then ex-
amined for the nucleus of sober fact upon which the legendary tale
has been built up.

As we look back upon our earliest historical horizon, we now know
that the men who stood there in the gray dawn of the age of writing,
were able to hear echoes of a remoter past, transmitted in the form of
oral tradition of which some portion was then committed to writing
and thus survived. In our modern effort to recover and reconstruct
the story of man’s past career, we have thus rehabilitated a new
body of sources, however cautious it behooves us to be in making
use of them. Not credulity, but historical method demands that we
now recognize these traditions, or the nucleus of fact to be drawn
from them, as a body of sources now to be restored to their proper
chronological position in the succession of surviving evidences which
reveal to us the past career of man on earth.

We are the first generation of men able to survey that career
without a serious break. As we marshal the evidence for its suc-
cessive stages, we humanists stand shoulder to shoulder with the
natural scientists; for as we look backward it is the materials and
the methods of the geologist which confront us first. The geologist
is succeeded by the paleontologist, the anthropologist, the anthro-
pogeographer and the archeologist. It is at this point, on the
border land between the investigations of the natural scientist and
those of the humanist that we must insert these long discarded
echoes from an age able to transmit only oral tradition, the true
value of which oriental research has now interpreted to us. The
Homeric songs of the Trojan War can no longer be regarded as ex-
clusively noble literature, of purely legendary content, and in the
presence of these earliest surviving monuments of science the Greek
tradition of substantial Egyptian contributions to knowledge must
not be rejected as baseless. There is every possibility that the tombs
of Egypt may yield us further scientific treatises like this great
Edwin Smith Medical Papyrus, and we still cherish the hope
that the thirty-five or forty chests, boxes, and caskets still lying in
the innermost chamber of the tomb of Tutenkhamon with their
seals unbroken, may contain written documents.
SHAMANISM OF THE NATIVES OF SIBERIA

By I. M. Casanowicz,

Assistant Curator, Division of Old World Archeology, United States National
Museum

[With 2 plates]

Shamanism is the name loosely given to certain religiomagic
beliefs and practices found generally in primitive communities in
which the officiating priest or functionary is a shaman. It does not
designate a specific religion, but a certain religious attitude based
on the animistic view of nature, the view that the world is pervaded
by spiritual forces—gods and spirits—which affect for good or ill
human life, and that certain persons can enter into close relations
with these powers and control them, and thus be mediators between
man and the spirit world. In fact, that men, or at least some men,
can enter into communication with the spiritual powers and use
them for benevolent or maleficent ends is a universal belief, the
common presupposition of magic as well as of religion. But more
specifically the term Shamanism is at present applied to those semi-
religious and semimagical procedures of the ecstatic wizards among
the native tribes of Siberia. The Shamanism of these peoples—
commonly called the Ural-Altaic tribes—may be considered as a
specialized and highly elaborated form of the universal practice.
It is there associated with a full and varied religion, polytheism
or polydaemonism, generally with a supreme god over all, of which
it is an essential and central part and connected with sacrifices,
liturgical prayers, chants, and formulae.

AREA OF THE SHAMANISTIC CULT

All the peoples of northern Asia, especially of the eastern part
of it, the Ugro-Finns, the Tunguse, the Mongolian, and Turkish
tribes, were formerly adherents of Shamanism. But Buddhism,
Mohammedanism, and, since the Russian conquest in the seventeenth
century, Christianity (in its orthodox version), have largely en-
ceroached upon it, so that it is now in a moribund condition and
rapidly disappearing. It is at present best represented by the

415
416 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Tunguse who, with the exception of the Manchus, are all Shaman-
ists. It is also to some extent in vogue among the Buryats living
west of Lake Baikal (those living on the east and south of that
lake having adopted Buddhism in its Lamaistic form), a few
Tartar tribes living among the Sajan and Altai Mountains (the
so-called Mountain Kalmuks, the Blackforest Tartars, and Shores),
and among some Samoyed tribes. On the other hand, Shamanism,
in turn, reacted on the new faiths. The Islam of the Siberian
Tartars and the Lamaism of the Buryats is greatly mixed up with
Shamanistic practices, while the Russian orthodoxy, forced upon
the Yakuts and other native tribes of northern Siberia, forms only
avery thin veneer over a full-blooded Shamanism. Indeed, old
Rusian settlers in those far-off regions have to a high degree become
** Shamanized.” 4

COSMOGONY AND WORLD VIEW OF SHAMANISM?

Shamanism has its root in a cosmogony and world view, which is
substantially common to all Shamanists. According to these the
world consists of three spiritual realms—an upper one, a lower, and
a middle one. The upper world is composed of seventeen strata or
heavens, and constitutes the realm of light, the dwelling of the gods
and good spirits who protect and preserve the weak race of man;
the lower, composed of seven or nine strata or hells, is the realm
of darkness, the abode of fiends, demons, and the damned. Between
heaven and the netherworld is the surface of the earth, the habita-
tion of the human race, so that this middle realm is under the influ-
ence of both the realms named above.* The cause of such a world
order was the fall of man as related in the legends of creation: In
the beginning all was water, neither earth nor heaven nor sun and
moon existed. Then Kaira Kan, the highest god, created first a be-
ing which was like himself and called it man (kisht). Kaira Kan
and the man were quietly floating over the water like two black
geese. But man was not contented with this blissful state, he wanted

1“ Shamanism seems to be such a natural product of the continental climate with its
extremes of cold and heat, of the violent burgas and burans (wind- and snow-storms),
of the hunger and fear which attend the long winters, that not only the Palaeo-Siberians

and the more highly cultivated Neo-Siberians, but even Europeans have sometimes fallen .

under the influence of certain Shamanistic superstitions. Such is the case with the
Russian peasants and officials who settle in Siberia and with the Russian Creoles.”

* Mainly abridged from Wilhelm Radloff, Aus Sibirien, Leipzig, 1884, Vol. II, pp. 1 ff.

* Radloff, op. cit., p. 3, would derive the conception of a world composed of strata from
the layers of the mountains, which the dwellers in the mountainous regions have ob-
served. But this, as in fact the whole rather lofty and elaborate cosmogony of the
Siberians, may be due in part to the influence of Mohammedanism with its seven
heavens and seven hells (comp. Holmes anniversary volume, Washington, 1916, p. 49),
and of Buddhism with its still more numerous heavens and hells.
SHAMANISM—CASANOWICZ 417

to rise higher than Kaira Kan. In consequence of this presumption
he lost his ethereal nature and sank into the bottomless water. Kaira
Kan out of compassion made man raise himself out of the depth, at
the same time bidding him to bring up the earth out of the water
as habitation for man since he could no more fly. But man, still
rebellious, in bringing up the earth put part of it into his mouth in
order to secretly create a land for himself. But when he came up
the earth swelled in his mouth so that he could not breathe and
would have choked if he had not spit it out at the command of Kaira
Kan. The land which Kaira Kan created was even and smooth, but
the earth which came out from the mouth of man sprawled in all
directions and covered whole land areas with swamp hills. Kaira
Kan named the man Erlik and banished him into darkness where
he became lord (Kan) of hell. Then Kaira Kan caused to grow
from the earth a tree with nine branches and under each branch
created a man. These nine men became the ancestors of the nine
tribes of mankind who people the earth.

Erlik by corrupting men got them into his power. Kaira Kan
in his anger over the wickedness and folly of mankind withdrew to
the uppermost of the seventeen heavens and banished Erlik to
the third stratum of the subterranean realm of darkness. Erlik,
persisting in his impiety, built with the evil spirits a heaven for
themselves in imitation of Kaira Kan’s heaven. But Kaira Kan
shattered it. The fragments of Erlik’s heaven falling upon earth,
which till then was even and smooth, caused the high mountains
and deep valleys. This time Erlik was thrust down to live forever
in the lowest world of darkness.

From Kaira Kan came as emanations the other high gods: Bai
Ulgan, highest after Kaira, who lives in the sixteenth heaven,
Ky Sagan, in the ninth heaven, and Mergen, in the seventh heaven,
where is also mother sun, while father moon lives in the fifth
heaven, where is also the demijurge creator. Bai Ulgan’s two sons
are in the third heaven. In this third heaven are also located the
“sea of milk,” or the spring of all life, the mountains of the gods,
and the paradise to which go the souls of the just and the blessed.
The latter are mediators between the gods of heaven and their
_offspring on earth, helping them when they are in distress.

Beneath this realm is that of Jersu, earth, conceived as a com-
munity of spirits, as an animate whole, at whose navel lives Jo Kan,
whose power is almost equal to that of Kaira Kan. Besides him
there are high lords (Kans), seventeen in number, corresponding
to the seventeen mountains and the seventeen seas. Where the
seventeen seas unite lives the Ocean Kan. There is also an Altai
Kan, the national or folk god. All these gods and demigods are, like
the heavenly lords, helpers of man and creative powers, but only
418 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924 y

the Jersu (earth) lords can be approached directly by ordinary
men, who offer them gifts or revere them by casting a stone on a
pile, or sing them hymns of praise. t

Contrary to these are the dwellers in the nine strata of the nether-
world, the evil spirits with their King Erlik Kan, enemies of man
who endeavor to harm him. From Erlik issue all misfortunes, from
poverty to death. He also seduces men to sin. From birth to death
there is a struggle between the good spirits and the evil ones about
man. At the birth of a human being a good spirit is sent down by Bai
Ulgan to supply it with life from the “sea of milk,” and ever after
to remain at his right shoulder, guiding him aright. But simul-
taneously Erlik sends up a devil from below to stand at the left
shoulder and mislead him. At death the soul goes to Erlik to be
judged by him, and both spirits give a record of his deeds. If the
good deeds predominate, the soul is delivered by the good spirit from
the realm of darkness and carried to the third heaven; if evil is
greater than good, it is dragged to hell and cast into a gigantic
caldron filled with boiling tar. Erlik is nevertheless called “ Father ”
Erlik, “because all men belong to him, and at the end he takes the
lives of all.” #

Now, only the earth lords can be approached directly by ordinary
men without an intermediary priest. Far different is it with the
great lords of the upper and the under world. They must be ap-
proached through the mediation of the spirits of the dead—in case
of the good gods through the Somo, the nine guardian ancestors of
men. But the power to control the ancestral and other spirits is in-
herent only in certain families. This power manifests itself when
a member of such a family is seized with an ecstasy and becomes
inspired and in this state is able to act in the capacity of an inter-

~mediary between man and the spirits.

To sum up the above delineation of the world view of Shamanism,
it may be said its philosophy is the personification of the forces of
nature, the view of the world as pervaded by spiritual agencies.
Man stands under the influence of two opposite powers, the power
of light and the power of darkness. The first, obviously, dwells in’

4Trlik is in many of his aspects a counterpart in Shamanistic mythology of Ahriman
(Angromainyus) in Zoroastrian theology. The conception of two spirits, one good and
one evil, accompanying man through life and recording his deeds after death, has some
analogy in Jewish and Mohammedan lore. ‘‘ Two angels—one good and one evil—accom-
pany man as he returns from the synagogue to his home on Sabbath,” Talmud, Shabbath,
119.5 “The two angels who accompany man testify as to his behavior,” Talmud, Hagi-
gah 16%. Mohammedan sources also assign two angels to accompany each person through
life, the one at his right recording his good deeds, the one at his left his evil doings.
Compare Koran, Sura xiii, 12: ‘“‘ Hach man has a succession of angels before and behind
him, they watch him by the command of God”; and Sura L, 16: “‘ When the two angels
deputed to take account of a man’s behavior take an account thereof, one sitting on the
right hand and the other on the left: he uttereth not a word”; that is, in the hour of
death the two angels write down the actions of man, the one on the right the good ones,
the one on the left the bad, and man ean not produce an excuse for the latter.

SHAMANISM—CASANOWICZ 419

heaven, whence comes every good gift; the second power dwells in
the source of darkness, in the bosom of the cold, dead earth. Be-
tween these two mighty powers lies the surface of the earth, which
is kin to man and is teeming with life apprehensible by him,
the Jersu with its mountains and seas, which supply him with all
the necessaries for the maintenance of his physical existence. But
the nature of the earth is variable and changeable, offering him no
protection against mishaps, losses, and pains. Therefore, man offers
his highest reverence to the unknown powers of light and darkness,
who control his own destiny as also the earth and its phenomena.
But these beings are so mighty and their workings so incompre-
hensible to him that he dares not enter into direct intercourse with
them. For these he needs those specially gifted persons who have
an understanding of the divine powers and the authority to control
them for the securing of good and averting of evil.

Although the spirits of light are believed to be more powerful
than those of darkness, the former need little attention because they
are good and kind, while the evil spirits, if not appeased, would
constantly do injury. It is also in human nature to accept the good
without much reflection, while the evil which man experiences and
the misfortunes which befall him stand out clearly in his conscious-
ness. In consequence, the Shamanistic cult consists for the most,
part in placating and controlling of evil spirits. But Shaman-
ism is not on that account to be termed a devil worship, but a cult of
spirits, or a ghost worship. The shaman is not possessed by a
devil, but by an ancestral spirit. When thus possessed he ascends
to heaven or descends to hell and influences the powers by the spirit
in him.

THE SHAMAN—NAME

The word “Shaman” is considered by some to be a corruption
of the Sanskrit Shramana, Pali, samana, an ascetic, which, indi-
cating a disciple of Buddha, became among the Mongolians synony-
mous with the magician. But the most acceptable explanation of
the word is that derived from the Manchu saman, pronounced
shaman, the fundamental meaning of which is “ one who is excited,
moved, raised,” thus answering to the principal characteristics of
the shaman. The name shaman is only found among the Tunguse,
Buryats, and Yakuts, but it is only among the Tunguse that it is the
native name, the Buryats and the Mongols calling their shaman 60 or
boe, and the female shaman odegon or utygan. Among the Yakuts
the shaman is called oywm, a female shaman, wdagan, among the
Ostyaks, senin, female, sentém. The Samoyeds call their shaman
.tadebei, and the Altaians use the term kam, and call the shaman’s
dealings with the spirits kamlanie, 1. e., kam-ing.
420 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

THE SHAMAN—CALL TO OFFICE

In some tribes the office of a shaman is hereditary; in others a
predisposition to it suffices. Among the Tunguse of Trans-Baikalia
a would-be shaman declares that a departed shaman has appeared
to him in a dream commanding him to take his office. Among
the Buryats and Lapps the office is usually hereditary, although
anyone may become a shaman or be chosen by the gods. The
inhabitants of the Altai district in northern central Asia consider
that the vocation of a shaman is spontaneously transmitted by in-
heritance from parents to children, like a kind of incubation.
Among the Ostyaks the shaman chooses one of his sons, according
to his fitness, to be his successor. The Yakuts believe that Sha-
manism seizes involuntarily upon the chosen individual. “It is
in general no rare occurrence that men who have been struck by
lightning are looked upon as chosen by the gods and are therefore
admitted to priestly honors. * * * Among the Buryats, if any-
body is killed by lightning, it is held to betoken the will of the
gods, who have thereby conferred a certain distinction upon the
family of the dead man; he is considered a shaman, and his nearest
relative enjoys the right of shamanhood.”> The Tunguse con-
sider children who bleed at the nose or mouth to be destined by the
gods to the profession of a shaman.

But in any case, whether succeeding to the office of shaman by
heredity or chosen by the spirits or self-chosen, the candidate usually
exhibits psychopathic traits. He is shy, distrait and moody, given
to. hallucinations and trances, or he is subject to epileptic fits. He
is fond of solitude and takes to the woods, jumps into fire or water,
hurts himself with weapons, and in general betrays the symptoms
of an abnormal person. Such abnormality is, however, by no means
universal.

When once called to the office of a shaman the candidate is not
free to accept or to decline the call. ‘The power of the ancestors
having passed into him, he must needs shamanize. If he resists
the will of his ancestors he exposes himself to terrible tortures, end-
ing either in the entire loss of his mental power, becoming an im-
becile, or in stark madness, which ends in suicide or death in a
paroxism.”* In general, “the vocation of the shaman is attended
with considerable danger. The slightest lack of harmony between
the acts of the shamans and the mysterious call of their ‘spirits’

brings their life to an end. * * * This is particularly so when
the shaman is slow to carry out those orders which are intended to
single him out from other people. * * * There exist traditions
about shamans who were carried away still living from the earth
to the sky, about others killed by the spirits or struck down at their
first meeting with the powers whom they dared to call upon.” *

THE SHAMAN—INITIATION

As a rule candidates for the profession of a shaman have to un-
dergo preparatory instruction which is imparted by some expert
practitioner. During the time of preparation the novice has to pass
through both a mental and a physical training. He is usually seg-
regated and goes either to the forests and hills or else he remains in
the inner room the whole time. His imagination is worked upon by
solitude, the contemplation of the gloomy aspect of surrounding
nature, long vigils and fasts with the use of narcotics, until he be-
comes persuaded that he, too, has seen the apparitions which he has
heard of from his boyhood. The shaman spirits usually appear in
the form of animals or birds. The most common guardian spirits
of the shaman are the wolf, the bear, the raven, the sea gull, and the
eagle. The Yakuts believe that every one of their Oyums has his
emekhet, or guardian spirits, and his bestial image, ze-kyle, sent
down from above. The emekhet, generally a dead shaman, occasion-
ally a secondary deity, always stays near the man it protects.

The novice has also to learn singing, dancing, ventriloquism, and
how to beat the drum. But it is not always that a preparatory in-
struction is necessary. ‘There are shamans who have obtained the
requisite powers and qualifications direct from the gods without be-
ing previously instructed in the profession.

THE SHAMAN—CONSECRATION

The consecration of the candidate to his office is among some
tribes accompanied by certain ceremonies. The candidate on this
occasion takes certain vows upon himself and becomes the property of
the spirits. Among the Yakuts, an old shaman takes him to a hill
or an open field, clothes him in shaman’s dress, invests him with
tambourine and drumstick, and placing him between nine chaste
youths on his right and nine chaste maidens on his left, makes him
promise that he will be faithful to the spirit who will fulfill his
prayers. Then he tells him where the various spirits dwell, what
diseases each causes, and how they may be appeased. Finally the

—=

422 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

new shaman kills the animal destined for sacrifice, his dress is sprin-
kled with the blood, and the flesh is eaten by the spectators.®

Among the Buryats the consecration of a shaman is very elaborate
and expensive, including purifications and ablutions, the sacrificing
of many animals, and a numerous personnel of assistants and par-
ticipants. He is addressed on this occasion: “ When thou art called
to a poor man, ask little in return for thy trouble and take what is
given. Take care of the poor, help them and pray to the gods to de-
fend them against the power of the evil spirits. If thou art called
by a rich man, go to him riding on a bullock and do not ask much
for your trouble. If thou art called at the same time by a poor and
by a rich man, go first to the poor.” The candidate repeats these
precepts after his mentor and promises to observe them.®

MALE AND FEMALE SHAMANS

Most commonly the shaman is a man. The natives about the
Altai mountains in northern central Asia allow only men to take
part in their sacrificial feasts so that consequently the shamans must
be men. Female shamans are found among the Tunguse, Ostyaks,
Buryats, and Yakuts, and though with the last they are regarded
as inferior to the male shaman, yet are preferred for the cure of
mental troubles. The Golds, on the Amur River, also have female
shamans, and among the Kamchadales, on the peninsula of Kam-
chatka, every old woman is looked upon as a witch and interpreter
of dreams.”

WHITE AND BLACK SHAMANS

The Buryats distinguish between white shamans, who serve the
good spirits (tengris) of the west, and the black shamans, who serve
the evil spirits of the east. The former are honored as those who
through their influence with the beneficent powers help and protect
men; the latter are feared because through the evil spirits they often
work harm to men. For one who has such power over spirits as to
drive them out from bodies must be able also to send them into people
and make them ill or mad. They may also steal the souls of their

1° Landtman, op. cit., p. 194 ff. In America, according to Dixon (l. «, p. 2), the
shamans are predominantly male, though women are by no means entirely excluded.
* Among the tribes of Patagonia there was a curious custom which prescribed the wear-
ing of female clothing by male shamans.” An analogous custom is found, according to
Sieroshevski-Sumner, ‘‘ The Yakuts,’’ in the Journal of the Anthropological Institute of
Great Britain and Ireland, vol. 31 (1901), p. 103 f., among the Yakuts of the Kolmyck
district, where the shamans ‘‘for want of any special dress, put on women’s dress.
They wear their hair long and comb and braid as women do. According to popular
belief, any shaman of more than ordinary power can bear children like a woman. They
even gave birth to various animals and birds.”
SHAMANISM—CASANOWICZ 423

victims. The Buryats also believe that the white and black shamans
fight with each other, hurling axes at one another from distances
of hundreds of miles. The black shamans are sometimes killed
for their evil deeds. Landtman™ adds: “Facts go to prove, how-
ever, that the distinction between good and evil disposed classes of
the priesthood is often arbitrarily drawn, with little or no regard
to the means, whether religious or magicial, which they make use of
in their practices.”

SHAMANS INCARNATED IN ANIMALS

It was stated above (p. 421) that the Yakuts believe that every
one of their shamans (oywms) has his emekhet, or guardian spirit,
and his bestial image ze-kyle, sent down from above. This incarna-
tion of the shaman in form of a beast is carefully concealed. Only
once a year, when the snow melts and the earth becomes black, do
the ze-kyles appear among the dwellings of men. The incarnate
souls of shamans in animal form are visible only to the eyes of
shamans, but they wander everywhere, unseen by all others.. They
often fight, and then the shaman whose ‘e-kyle is beaten falls ill or
dies. The weakest and most cowardly shamans are those of the
canine variety; the most powerful wizards are those whose ée-kyle
is a stallion, an elk, a black bear, an eagle, or the huge bull boar.
The Samoyeds of the Turukhinsk region hold that every shaman
has a familar spirit in the shape of a boar, which he leads about by
a magic belt. On the death of the boar, the shaman himself dies,
and stories are told of battles between wizards, who send their spirits
to fight before they encounter each other in person.?”

DEAD SHAMANS

The souls of the departed are generally believed by primitives to
be more or less hostile and dangerous to the living. This the more
so in case of the ghosts of wizards who were already powerful in
life. Hence “the Turanian tribes of northern Asia fear their sha-
mans even more when dead than when alive, for they become then
a special class of spirits who are the most hurtful of all.”+* Among
the Yakuts the shamans are thought to be transferred after death
into evil spirits. The dead shamans are buried with great haste by
night or at evening in a remote nook in a grove or in a forest open-
ing, and the place is always afterwards carefully avoided. On the

other hand, among the Ostyaks when a shaman dies the ordinary
custom of offering divine honors to the dead changes in his favor
into a complete and decided canonization.“ Among the Buryats
soon after a shaman dies one of his friends falls in a trance—struck
by invisible thunderbolt, launched by gods—and when he recovers
announces that the dead shaman’s spirit has confided to him the
spot in which he wishes to rest. The body is cremated and the ashes
are placed in a hole cut in one of the largest trees in the appointed
part of the forest. The spot then becomes sacred.¥

The grave of a black shaman is usually shaded with aspens, and
the body is fastened to the earth with a stake taken from that tree.

THE SHAMAN—APPEARANCE AND OUTFIT

“In general,” says Sieroshevski (1. c., p. 102), “there is in the
appearance of a shaman something peculiar, which enabled the
author after some practice to distinguish him with great certainty
in the midst of a number cf persons. He is distinguished by a cer-
tain energy and mobility of the muscles of the face, which generally
among the Yakuts are immobile. There is also in his movements a
noticeable spryness.” Add to this that the shaman is sometimes
mentally abnormal, an epileptic or afflicted with some milder neu-
rosis, which is aggravated by the practice of his calling and further
reinforced when, as is the case among some tribes, the office is
hereditary or runs in families, and that primitives everywhere re-
gard the physically, and more so the mentally, abnormal as due to
spirit possession.

Besides these peculiar personal physical and psychical traits, the
shaman as mediator in dealings with the spirit world bears during
his functions outward signs to inspire the people with feelings of
mystery and awe, and to betoken his separateness from the rest of
the population. So the shaman at his ceremonies dons a special
dress—a coat (kaftan) made of cloth or bearskins, hung with pieces
of iron—rattles, rings, and representations of animals, or twisted
handkerchiefs representing snakes. All these have a definite mean-
ing and purpose and often a mystic character. The Yakut shamans
adorn their coats with a representation of the sun with holes in it,
and half moon, indicating the twilight that reigns in the spirit land.
The mythical animals on the dress signify the monsters in the spirit
world which the shaman has to combat, while the iron plates are
to protect him against the blows of malevolent spirits. The great

shamans are also distinquished by the amagyat on their breast, a
metal plate, usually copper, adorned with the figure of a man. It
represents the shaman’s spirit protector or ancestor spirit. It is
a particular badge of the shaman’s vocation which is given by the
old shaman to the new.

But the most important accessory of the shaman’s outfit is the
tambourine (tungur or tur) with the drumstick, without which his
conjurations have no force and his soothsaying is without validity.
The mighty sounds of the magic drum penetrate into the world of
spirits, causing them to submit to his will. Besides its power to
call up and gather into it the spirits, it serves the shaman as a
vehicle in his flight to heaven or in descending into the dark realm
of Erlik. The form of the tambourine varies with different tribes.
With some it is circular; with others it is oval, with its longest
diameter of about 24 inches. Inside the drum, on the long side of
the hoop, is a handle in form of a stave. This handle is usually in
the crude form of a man, broadening at the upper end to represent
a head and forming at the lower end a fork resembling legs. This
handle is called the “host” (tungur ast) of the drum. Along the
arms of the “host ’are fastened iron rattles and bells, the number
of which is greater or less, according to the rank of the shaman,
and corresponding with the number of spirits subject to him. On
the outside the skin of the drum is decorated with figures of a
symbolic kind, intimately connected with shamanistic beliefs and
mysteries (see pls. 1 and 2). Among the Buryats the novice is
not permitted to acquire the drum until after the third year from his
consecration. To the paraphernalia of a Buryat shaman belong
also two horse staves, cut from a live birch tree in such a manner
that the tree should not die. They represent the horses on which
the shaman flies to heaven.

THE SHAMAN—HIS FUNCTIONS

The ideal shaman unites in his person the offices of priest, healer,
and prophet. As a priest he officiates at communal as well as private
sacrifices and ceremonials. But the shaman’s priestly functions are
of secondary importance to and emanate from his other functions.
There are many sacrifices and ceremonies at which his participation is
not essential. His connection with sacrifice is mainly the fact that as
one who knows the will of the gods or spirits and what sacrifices
will be pleasing to them on any occasion he determines their nature
and the method of offering them.

Sickness is according to the belief not only of primitive peoples
but was also of some highly advanced in civilization, as the Baby-
lonians and Assyrians, due to a malevolent spirit that has got into a
426 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

a

man and must be expelled. But only the shaman, who is himself
possessed by spirits, is fitted to deal with the demon in such a man-
ner as to bring about the recovery of the patient. The procedure
frequently takes the form of a duel between the shaman, or rather
the spirit he has conjured into himself, and the spirit that has in-
vaded the patient, in which the latter is vanquished and expelled.
This is perhaps the most primitive form of exorcism. The expulsion
of disease demons is often accompanied by the use of herbs, purga-
tions, fumigations, and manipulations, which sometimes have
remedial effects, so that the shaman is in a measure a forerunner
of the physician. Diseases are also caused by the soul of a man
having been frightened out of his body and fled away. The shaman
pursues it wherever it has gone, even to the prison of Erlik, and re-
stores it to the owner. -

But it is the gift of prophecy, or the art of divination, that makes
the shaman powerful and is the basis of his other functions. He has
direct intercourse with the spirits and actual access to the spirit
world, and so obtains knowledge superior to that of ordinary men.
By virtue of this knowledge he can give directions about worship
and sacrifice, and overcome or drive out hostile spirits. He can
foretell the future, find out what is going on in distant places, dis-
cover secrets, detect thieves, and answer all manner of questions for
which men resort to a soothsayer or prophet. Divination by the
shaman may be practiced by the shoulder blade of a sheep or
the flight of arrows. But the characteristic method of Shamanistic
divination is the seance, or what is locally known as kamlanie.
In this the shaman by smoking, the use of other narcotics, singing,
shouting, dancing, beating of the tambourine, and so on, produces
a state of trance or alternate personality. While in this state the
spirits take possession of him and reveal their will to him or give
him the desired information.*®

THE SIBERIAN SHAMAN CONTRASTED WITH THE AMERICAN
MEDICINE MAN

The main aspects of the Siberian shaman’s procedure, as well as
the idea of possession by spirits, are found to be well-nigh of uni-
versal occurrence in connection with healing, discovering the will of
spirits or gods, or soothsaying. One may occur without the others,

17 Mikhailovskhii, J. ¢., p. 99, quotes the following Buryat tradition about this bone: “A
written law was given by God to the chief tribal ancestor of the Buryats. On his way
home to his own people he fell asleep under a haystack. A ewe came to the stack and
ate up the law with the hay, but the law became engraved on the ewe’s shoulder blade.”

18'The answers of the shaman, or rather of the spirit he conjures into himself, te
questions about all sorts of things which there is no natural means of knowing, is per-
haps the oldest form of natural divination and the origin of the idea of revelation.”
George Foot Moore, The Birth and Growth of Religion, 1923, p. 88.

or, again, all are found as parts of the practice of a sorcerer, or
wonder-worker. Again, the methods of the medicine man are also
found everywhere and largely enter into the shaman’s practices.
But while the shaman’s methods are connected with the cult of
spirits and are not fundamentally magical, but rather mysticism of
a primitive kind, seeking intimate communion with the spirit
world, those of the medicine man are partly magical, partly em-
pirical with the use of naturalistic methods of healing, and are not
necessarily connected with the spirit world. The shaman’s procedure
is mainly based on the fact that he is en rapport with spirits and can
control them, while the medicine man generally acts by methods in
which the aid of spirits is not essential.*®

SHAMANISM CONTRASTED WITH FETISHISM

Fetishism, the belief that material objects can become, by appro-
priate rites and incantations, habitations of mysterious or magical
powers, has some kinship to Shamanism. It also springs from ani-
mism, being the expression of the notion that the world is pervaded
by mysterious spiritual powers. But while in Fetishism the magical
power is believed to reside in the instrument or in particular sub-
stances, or that the fetish itself is something supernatural, a quasi-
personified power or potency, having volition, in Shamanism the
will-effect of the shaman is the efficient factor in compelling ghosts
or spirits or gods to do his will. In Fetishism the emphasis is laid
on the thing, although rites and incantations may be employed in
making the fetish; in Shamanism the prime factor is the personality
and will of the shaman, although he may employ like means.

THE SHAMAN IN ACTION”

The activity of the shaman as a priest or sacrificer, a conjurer up
of spirits, and as a prophet is most impressively illustrated by the
ceremonies attending the sacrifice to Bai Ulgan, who dwells in the
sixteenth heaven, and is next in rank to Kaira Kan, the highest god.
It is something like a mystery play or religious drama in which the
shaman as conjurer of the spirits is the actor. The procedure of this
sacrifice and the ceremonies, conjurations, and incantations accom-
panying it are very elaborate and are distributed over three evenings.

On the first evening the shaman selects a spot in a birch thicket and
there places a new ornamented yurta (tent). In the yurta a young

birch tree with the lower branches lopped is set up; on one of the

* Comp. also Dixon, 1. c., p. 12: “As compared with their representatives in other
parts of the world, the shamans in America seem to show, both in their making and in
their whole character, less reliance on the dead, the ancestral spirits, than do those of
other regions * * * deriving his power from animals and natural phenomena.”

428 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

upper branches a flag is hung. At the bottom of the tree nine steps
(tapty) are cut with an ax. Round the yurta a penfold is made.
Opposite the door of the yurta is the entrance from the courtyard
and near this entrance a birch pole with a noose of horsehair is set
up. Then a horse agreeable to the deity is chosen, which is held by
a person chosen from those present and who is called “holder of the
head”—bashi-tukan kiski. 'The shaman waves a birch twig over the
horse’s back, thus driving its soul to Ulgan, accompanied by the hold-
er’s soul, invoking the spirits to come and assist in the action of the
sacrificing. The assembling of the spirits in the tambourine takes
place with great solemnity. The shaman summons each spirit sep-
arately, who answers: “ Here I am Kam,” at the same time moving
the tambourine as if taking the spirit into it. When he has assembled
these spirit assistants, the shaman goes outside the yurta, sits down
on a scarecrow in form of a goose stuffed with hay and covered with
cloth, and moving both arms rapidly like wings, sings in a loud
voice:

Below the white sky,

Above the white cloud,
Below the blue sky,
Above the blue cloud—

Mount a bird to the sky!
The goose replies by quacking: “ Ungai gak gak, ungai gak, kaigai
gak, kaigai gak.” The shaman himself, of course, does this imitation
of the goose’s quacking, as he also answers for the spirits. On this
feathered steed the shaman pursues the soul (pura) of the horse,
imitating the horse’s neighing. Finally, with the aid of the specta-
tors, he drives the horse to the birch pole with the noose which repre-
sents the guardian of the animal’s soul. After much straining and
drawing, to represent the breaking away and the recapturing of the
pura, the shaman incenses the animal with juniper, blesses it, and,
with the aid of some of the bystanders kills it in a most barbarous
and cruel manner. The dead animal is skinned and cut up in a very
elaborate manner so that bones are not broken or damaged in any
way. The flesh is cooked in caldrons and then laid out ‘on birch
branches. The shaman first takes part of it in a wooden dish and
offers it to the ancestral and the protecting spirits of the yurta. Part
of this offering the shaman distributes among the members of the
family and their relatives. The best part is presented to the
shaman; the remainder is distributed among the guests. The bones
are preserved as consecrated to the gods.

The most important part of the performance takes place on the
second evening, when the shaman’s journey to Bai Ulgan in heaven
is enacted. The shaman invokes with rhythmical chants the various
spirits, the lords of the tambourine, the mother of the fire, the seven-

ie oe
SHAMANISM—CASANOWICZ 429

teen lords of the jersu, and Merkyut, the bird of heaven, and offers
them a libation. Then he incenses with juniper nine garments hung
on a rope and offers them with a song on behalf of the head of the
house to Bai Ulgan. As the spirits are gathered the shaman beats
the tambourine more loudly. He circles several times the birch tree
in the yurta, then he kneels in front of the door and asks the imagi-
nary porter spirit to grant him a guide. By touching the members
of the family with the drum en their chests and with the drumstick
their backs—the seat of the soul—he purifies and liberates them from
all evil, and by putting the tambourine close to the host’s ears and
striking it he drives into him the spirit and power of his protecting
ancestors. At last begins the ascent to heaven. Jumping, shouting
with symbolical movements, accompanied by wild gestures, the sha-
man passes into ecstasy. Then he suddenly places himself on the
first step cut out in the trunk of the birch tree, raising the tambourine
and thumping it with all his might. He is rising to the sky. Krom
heaven to heaven he passes, riding on the goose, accompanying the
ascent by songs and incantations and beating of the drum in vari-
ous tempos and scales, modulating and changing his voice in imita-
tion of the supposed answerers. At each stage he tells the audience
what he has seen and heard. And finally having reached the ninth
or even the twelfth heaven, he addresses a humble prayer to Bai
Ulgan and learns whether the sacrifice is accepted and receives in-
formation concerning the coming weather, the harvest, sickness or
other misfortunes, as well as the sacrifices which will be required in
the near future. After this interview with Ulgan the ecstasy or
delirium of the shaman reaches its climax, he collapses and lies
motionless. After a while he gradually rouses himself, rubs his eyes
and greets those present as if after a long absence.

The third night is spent in libations and feasting, during which
enormous quantities of koumiss and strong drinks are consumed.

THE PURIFICATION OF A YURTA® _

The highest art of the shaman is brought into play in the so-
called purification of a yurta. This takes place on the fortieth day
after the death of a member of the family. Only few shamans
are competent to carry out this conjuration in a successful manner;
rich people, therefore, call on a widely famous shaman for the
performance of this service, who is then richly rewarded. The
purification is usually performed with the aid of Yaryik Kan, to
whom the sacrifice is made for this assistance. According to the
belief of the Altaians (shared by many other peoples) the soul of
the dead remains for some time in the yurta and is reluctant to

21 Radloff, op. cit., pp. 52 ff.
430 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

depart to the realm of the dead unless in company of other members
of the household, or at least of some cattle. Yaryik, being the
Jersu prince of the seas, is best able, by driving waterfloods,
to force the return of the abducted souls and to drive the soul of
the departed to the netherworld.

The belief of the noxious influence of the soul of the dead has
its basis in the close family relationship between the dead and the
surviving members, which may be considered as the basis of the
shamanistic theory and practice. Another cause of this belief
is the frequency of epidemics, which, with the lack of sanitary pre-
cautions and medical help among the Altaic peoples, are often
frightfully devastating and which the people charge to the hostility
of the ghosts.

Doctor Radloff had the opportunity to attend such a purifi-
cation in July, 1860, on the Kengi Lake. In the yurta after sunset
were about twenty persons, relatives and neighbors, assembled. It
was to be a purification after the death of the housewife. The
guests present were quite unconcerned, chatting and smoking.
When dusk descended there was heard from a distance the dull
sounds of the shaman’s drum. By and by the shaman entered the
yurta, his chant and beating of the drum gradually softened, pass-
ing into a sort of whining and whispering. He held a dialogue
with the soul of the deceased, who piteously implored him to let
her stay in the yurta with her children. But the shaman merci-
lessly presses the soul by the power of the drum, which is filled
with mighty spirits, until at last he catches it between the drum
and the drumstick and presses it to earth. By changing the modu-
lation of his song and of beating the drum he indicates that he
has brought the soul to the netherworld. There a dialogue is
started with the preceding relatives to whom he has brought the
soul of the lately deceased. They decline to accept her. The
shaman regales them with vodka, which puts them into a hilarious
humor. They sing and are merry, and thus the shaman succeeds
in smuggling in the new soul.

When the shaman calls in the aid of Yaryik the merry scene
in the netherworld is suddenly interrupted through the inrushing of
the flood. The souls cry for help, whine and lament, and the cattle
and souls of relatives, which the deceased took along, are driven
back home. The shaman imitates the rushing of the waves and
roaring of the pressing water. Sometimes the shaman does not
succeed in smuggling in the new soul, or the soul escapes and returns
to the yurta. Then the scene begins anew.

Returning from Sheol to the upper world, the shaman fell into
a frenzy, singing and dancing wildly until he collapsed.

SHAMANISM—CASANOWICZ 431

Radloff describes the mighty impression which this wild scene
produced on him and the other guests who were all shaken and
dumbstruck.

Radloff adds: “The offering of the sacrifice and purification of
the yurta are the proper priestly functions of the shaman. In them
he has to develop his entire art, and he is the right shaman who
understands how to arouse the fear and confidence of his audience,
so that they believe that his predictions are true oracles by which
the gods try to console and uplight them. Other actions of the
shaman are without importance. Pronouncing blessings and thanks-
giving other mortals can do, as also the performing of libations
to the jersu. Weather making and soothsaying are likewise not
exclusive prerogatives of the shaman. At birth, marriage, and
funerals the shaman has no share, unless these events are accom-
panied by unfavorable omens, when he is called to avert them by
conjuration and exorcism.”

THE SHAMAN—HIS INFLUENCE

The shaman as mediator between men and spirits, uniting in
himself the many functions described above, enjoys great respect
among the people. But he is more feared than loved. His peculiar
dress, his wild and convulsive antics, the sound of the tambourine—
all lead to powerfully affect the nerves of an unsophisticated people
and to strike terror into their hearts. There is also a general
craving in man for the mysterious and for spiritual assistance in
the adversities and misfortunes of human life which the shaman
is believed to satisfy. There is a certain artistry in the shamanistic
practice. “Observation justifies the division of shamans into great,
middling, and petty. Some of them dispose of light and darkness
in such a masterly manner, also of silence and incantation; the
modulation of the voice is so flexible, the gestures so peculiar and
expressive, the blows of the drum and the tone of them correspond
so well to the moment, and all is intertwined with such an original
series of unexpected words, witty observations, artistic and often
elegant metaphors, that involuntarily you give yourself up to the
charm of watching this wild and free evocation of a wild and free
spirit.” 2?

The shaman is often a man of unusual intelligence and mental re-
sources; he has a profound knowledge of the simple life of his
neighbors and gradually acquires the habit of solving their per-
plexities by a logic of his own peculiar talent, and in many cases the
rite performed is to bring about a result which, like rain or sun-

-  Sieroshevski, l. c. p. 105.
432 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

shine, is about to happen, sooner or later anyway, and by shrewd
turning to account of accidents he manages to assert and maintain his
ascendency. Obviously, it can not be otherwise that many of the
divinations and predictions of the shaman are belied by the results,
but with childlike credulous peoples one successful instance causes
them to ignore or forget all previous failures and deceptions.

Still the shamans could hardly, for any length of time, keep up
the belief in their superiority without convincing the people by
“miracles ”’—that is, by executing feats which exceed the power of
the laity to perform or to understand—of their supernatural endow-
ments. And, as a matter of fact, according to the testimony of
travelers and explorers, some shamans are past masters in the arts
of ventriloquism and sleight-of-hand tricks. Thus Bogoras says:
“Shamans could, with credit to themselves, carry on a contest with
the best practioners of similar arts in civilized countries. The voices
are successful imitations of different sounds; human, superhuman,
animal, even of tempests and winds, or of an echo, and come from
all sides of the room, from without, from above, and from under-
ground. The whole of nature may sometimes be represented in the
small inner room of the Chukchee.” 7%

“The shamans of the Ostiaks,” says Landtman, “strengthen their
reputation not infrequently by delusive demonstrations of their in-
vulnerability, stabbing themselves with knives in different parts of
the body. For the same purpose the shamans of certain Tartar
tribes throw themselves into the fire and seize live coals with their
hands.” *4 “On another occasion,” relates Jochelson, “the shaman
took his knife, which was sharp and looked like a dagger, and thrust
it into his breast up to the hilt, while emitting a rattling sound from
his throat. I noticed, however, that after cutting his jacket he
turned the knife downward. He drew out the knife with the same
rattling in his throat and resumed beating the drum * * * and
returning the knife to him showed through the hole in his coat the
blood on his body. Of course, these spots had been made before.”
Jochelson adds: “ However, this can not be looked upon as mere
deception. ‘Things visible and imaginary are confounded to such
an extent in primitive consciousness that the shaman himself may
have thought that there was, invisible to others, a real gash in his
body as has been demanded by the spirits.”*> Czaplicka remarks
(p. 283): “'The practice of stabbing oneself through the stomach
with a knife is universal in Shamanistic performances * * *. It

quism.

would be difficult to describe all the tricks performed by shamans:
Some of the commonest are the swallowing of burning coals, setting
oneself free from a cord by which one is bound, etc.” There is also
nothing new about the pranks of the spirits in our spiritualistic
seances: “Sometimes the spirits are mischievous. In the movable
tents of the reindeer people an invisible hand will sometimes turn
everything upside down and throw different objects about, such as
snow, pieces of ice * * *. The audience is strictly forbidden to
make any attempts whatever to touch the ‘ spirits ’.” 7°

THE SHAMAN—HIS MENTAL ATTITUDE

The question is: Is the shaman himself convinced of the power of
his*conjurations or is he a play actor, playing a comedy before the
superstitious people? In general and a priori it may be said that
the rise of so complex a phenomenon as shamanism can not be
explained by mere trickery and deception. Only a profound belief
in their calling could create the conviction in the people of the
miraculous power of the shamans and endow them with the enor-
mous influence which they enjoy among the Siberian tribes. “ You
can not fool all the people all the time,” has its application also
in this case. The fact that the shaman employs external devices and
artifices to impress or even to deceive the spectators does not ex-
clude the possibility of his earnest belief that he has intercourse
with the spirits, is inspired by thesn and possesses mysterious power.
Jt is the unanimous opinion of investigators and observers of the
practices and psychology of wizards everywhere that truth and
fiction are closely combined and inseparably blended into one whole
in this phenomenon. Just the intense conviction that the spirits
speak and work through him may prompt the wizard to use external
accessories and to change in good faith the tones of his voice to
assist the work of the spirit and to suit its utterance. “ Nothing is
more superficial,” says Reville, “than the opinion of those who
see in the sorcerer of the uncivilized peoples only a charletan and a
juggler. Without doubt he is strongly driven to the proneness
in which charlatanism is not long in becoming in some manner fatal.
But in reality, not only do all others around him believe in his
superior powers, but he himself believes in them, because the states
of hallucination, of ecstasies and mental overexcitement, which are
not simulated, have for him as fer others the only explanation in
the assumption of his intimate intercourse with the invisible spirit.” 2”

Among the Yakuts, Sieroshevski says, “Some shamans are as pas-
sionately devoted to their calling as drunkards to drink. One of

“26 W, Bogoras, The Chuckchee, p. 438, quoted by Czaplicka, p. 232.

them had severeal times been condemned (by the Russian authorities)
to punishment, his professional drum and dress had been burned,
his hair had been cut off, and he had been compelled to make a
number of obeisances and to fast. He remarked: ‘We do not carry
on this calling without paying for it. Our masters (the spirits)
keep a zealous watch over us, and woe betide us afterwards if we
do not satisfy them; but we can not quit it; we can not cease to prac-
tice shaman rites. Yet we do no evil.’”**

On the whole, it may be said that shamanism includes a truly
religious element inasmuch as it confirms the thought that man de-
pends on spiritual forces, and one may agree with Radloff that it
“certainly promotes and sustains certain ethical endeavors.” And
if it was not once “the common cuit of all the Turanian peoples ? or
even the “very earliest religion of the world,” as some are inclined
to think, it seems certain to be a phenomenon of great antiquity and
of relative primitiveness.

EGYPT AS A FIELD FOR ANTHROPOLOGICAL RE-
SEARCH?

By Proressor P. E. NEWBERRY, M.A., O.B.E.

When I received the honor of an invitation to preside at the An-
thropological Section of the British Association my thoughts nat-
urally turned to the subject of the presidential address, which, if
I accepted the invitation, it would be my duty to prepare. On
looking back over the addresses of past presidents of this section
since its institution in 1884 I found that no one had dealt with
Egypt as a field for anthropological research. It was because of
this that I decided to accept the council’s invitation, and I am here
to-day to bring before your notice some facts regarding the civiliza-
tion of the country with which I have long been associated, and in
which I have spent many years of my life.

In 1897, when the British Association last met in this great city
on the Mersey-side, Sir Arthur Evans occupied the presidential
chair of this section, and the subject of his address was “The
Eastern Question in Anthropology.” Surveying the early history of
civilization as far as it was then known, he insisted that the ade-
quate recognition of the Eastern background was essential to the
right understanding of the Augean. He laid stress on the part
which Crete had played in the first emancipation of the European
genius, and pointed out that in Crete, far earlier than elsewhere,
can be traced the vestiges of primeval intercourse with the Nile
Valley. Nineteen years later, years that were extraordinarily pro-
lifie in archeological discovery in every part of the Near East, Sir
Arthur occupied the presidential chair of the British Association
at Newcastle. He then addressed us on “ New archeological lights
on the origins of civilization in Europe.” Referring to his epoch-
making discoveries in Crete he said, “It is interesting to note that
the first quickening impulse came to Crete from the Egyptian and
not from the Oriental side; the Eastern factor in it is of compara-
tively late appearance.” By that time Sir Arthur’s researches had

led him to the “definite conclusion that cultural influences were
already reaching Crete from beyond the Libyan Sea, before the be-
ginning of the Egyptian Dynasties.” He further said “the impres-
sion of a very active agency indeed is so strong that the possibility
of some actual immigration into the island of the older Egyptian
element due to the conquests of the first Pharaohs, can not be
excluded.”

I propose to-day to deal with some of the questions relating to the
origins of the Egyptian civilization, and incidentally shall touch
upon this Cretan problem. At the end of my address I shall very
briefly refer to the much neglected modern Egyptians, and to the
need there is to study them. Much has been written during the last
20 years about the origins of the Egyptian civilization, but there
are some facts which I think have either escaped notice or have not
been duly considered, and there are others upon which, in my opinion,
insufficient stress has been laid. I am not going to deal with the
physical characteristics of the people, for that is not my province.
I shall confine myself to certain inferences that I believe can be
drawn from the monuments of predynastic and dynastic times.

It is generally agreed that the habits, modes of life, and occupa-
tions of all communities are immediately dependent upon the fea-
tures and products of the land in which they dwell. Any inquiry
into Egyptian origins ought, therefore, to begin with the question,
What were the physical conditions that prevailed in the Lower Nile
Valley immediately preceding and during the rise of its civiliza-
tion? Until this question is answered I do not think that we are in
a position to deal with such important problems as, e. g., agriculture,
architecture, shipbuilding, tool-making, or weaving. The first thing
that we ought to know is what were the kinds of trees, plants, and
animals that were to be found in Egypt in the wild state, and what
was the economic value of the indigenous flora and fauna. We
ought, in fact, to know what the country was like in pre-agricultural
days. If there was no timber in the country, then it may, I think,
be confidently said that the art of the carpenter did not originate
in Egypt; that the architectural styles founded on wood construc-
tion could not have arisen there; that the art of shipbuilding (at
all events of building ships of wood) did not originate there. Simi-
larly, if there were no incense-bearing trees or shrubs in the country,
it is difficult to imagine that the ceremonial use of incense arose
there. Again, the art of weaving presupposes the presence of sheep
or goats for wool, or of flax for linen thread. All these kinds of
problems depend upon the natural products of a country, or they
did so depend in the early days of civilization.

We are accustomed to regard Egypt as a paradise, as the most
fertile country in the world, where, if we but scratch the soil and

iar pos Xo
EGYPT—NEWBERRY 437

scatter seed, we have only to await and gather the harvest. The
Greeks spoke of Egypt as the most fit place for the first generations
of men, for there, they said, food was always ready at hand, and it
took no labor to secure an abundant supply. But there can be no
doubt that the Egypt of to-day is a very different place from the
Egypt of pre-agricultural times. There has been a great but
gradual change in the physical condition of the whole country. In
the mortuary chapels of tombs of the Old and Middle Kingdoms,
as well as in many of the Empire, are scenes of papyrus swamps and
reed marshes; in these swamps and marshes are figured the animals
and birds that then frequented them. Among the animals are
the hippopotamus and the wild boar, the crocodile, the ibis, and a
great variety of water fowl. These animals, and some of the birds,
have now disappeared from the region north of the First Cataract.
Only very recently has the crocodile become extinct north of Aswan.
It was still occasionally seen in the Delta as late as the middle of the
eighteenth century, and it was fairly plentiful in Upper Egypt up
to the middle ef the nineteenth century, but it is now rarely, if ever,
seen north of Wadi Halfa. It is the same with the hippopotamus.
In the twelfth century this mammal still frequented the Damietta
branch of the Nile, and two specimens were actually killed near
Damietta by an Italian surgeon in the year 1600.2. In the Dongola
Province of Nubia it was very common at the beginning of last cen-
tury, and Burckhardt states that is was then a terrible plague there
on account of its voracity. In 1812 several hippopotami passed the
Second Catarac; and made their appearance at Wadi Halfa and
Derr, while one was actually seen at Darfwi, a day’s march north of
Aswan.* The wild boar is apparently now extinct in Egypt, but
specimens were shot in the Delta and in the region of the Wadi
Natriin during last century. The ibis has gradually disappeared
from the Lower Nile Valley, where it was once so common. ‘The last
specimen of this bird recorded in Egypt was shot in 1877 in Lake
Menzaleh. It 1s sometimes seen in Lower Nubia, but has now en-
tirely disappeared from Egypt proper.

Much is known about the ancient fauna of the desert wadies from
the paintings and sculptured scenes in the tombs of the Old and
Middle Kingdoms and of the Empire. On the walls of many of
these tombs are depicted hunting scenes, and among the wild animals
figured in them are the lion, leopard, Barbary sheep, wild ass, wild
ox, hartebeest, oryx, ibex, addax, dorcas gazelle, fallow deer, giraffe,

and ostrich. As several of these animals are not now known in
Egypt it has been argued that the scenes do not faithfully represent
the ancient fauna of the country. But I can see no reason to doubt
that the scenes depict actual hunts that took place in the Arabian
and Libyan Deserts not far from the localities in which the tombs
figuring them are found. There is some corroborative evidence in
the references in the ancient literature to the hunting of the wild
animals that frequented Egypt. Thutmose IV., for example, hunted
the lion and ibex in the desert plateau near Memphis: * Amenhotep
III. killed 102 fierce lions during the first ten years of his reign,®
and in his second regnal year he hunted wild cattle in the desert near
Keneh;* he saw there a herd of 170, and of these he and his hunts-
men captured 96. The desert to the east of Kift was a famous
hunting-ground at the time of the Eighteenth Dynasty. At the
present day all but one of the animals represented in these ancient
hunting scenes are found in the Nubian Deserts to the south of
Egypt. The exception is important; it is the fallow deer which be-
longs to the Holarctic, not to the Ethiopian, zoological zone. Al-
though most of the animals that were hunted by the dynastic Egyp-
tians have now disappeared from their northern home, many have
been recorded in recent years as occurring in the Arabian and Libyan
Deserts. We can, in fact, follow them gradually receding south-
wards. The dorcas gazelle is still common in both deserts, and the
addax sometimes occurs in the region of the Wadi Natrfin. The
ibex is occasionally seen on the mountains northeast of Keneh. The
Barbary sheep (Ammotragus tragelaphus) was observed by Dr.
Schweinfurth in 1878 in the Wadi Shietun which opens on the Nile
below Ekhmim.”? The wild ass was recorded by James Burton in
1823 in the desert northeast of Keneh; he remarks that then the
Arabs of this part of the desert let their female donkeys loose to be
served by the wild males.’ Later, in 1828, Linant de Bellefonds saw
many wild asses in the region between Daréwi and Berber; they
were, he says, often trapped by the Bisharin, who used the flesh as
food. During the first half of the eighteenth century the ostrich
frequented the desert near Suez.? A hundred years later it was re-
ported to be numerous in the Arabian Desert opposite Esneh, and
there is a wadi, some distance southeast of Aswan, that is called by
the Arabs Wadi Naam, “the Wadi of Ostriches.” In the Libyan
Desert the bird was fairly common in the eighteenth century. W. G.
Browne, who traveled along the coast west of Alexandria in 1792,

states that tracks of the ostrich were frequently seen, and he noted
also that the bird sometimes appeared in the neighborhood of the
Wadi Natriin.” Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire in 1799 reported that it was
then common in the mountains southwest of Alexandria."* In 1837
Lord Lindsay saw the ostrich near Esneh,* but the northern limit of
the bird is now very much further south. The lion is mentioned by
Sonnini at the end of the eighteenth century as one of the larger
carnivora which then approached the confines of Egypt, but did not
long remain in the country.

Now the appearance of all these animals in Egypt, and in its
bordering deserts in dynastic times presupposes that the vegetation
of the wadies was much more abundant then than now, and this again
presupposes a greater rainfall than we find at present. The dis-
appearance of the dynastic fauna is not, however, entirely due to the
change in climatic conditions. The Arabs have a saying that it was
the camel that drove the lion out of Egypt, and this is doubtless
true. The lion depends mainly on the antelope tribe for its food
supply. The antelopes, on the other hand, depend for their sus-
tenance on herbage and grass, and this has been consumed to a great
extent by the camels, which, since Arab times, have been bred in
great numbers in the Arabian and Nubian Deserts. It is certain that
the advent of the camel was a factor in driving southward many
of the wild animals that were at one time so common in Egypt, but
are now characteristic of the Ethiopian region.

The characteristic wild trees of the dynastic flora of Egypt, as we
know from the remains of them that have been found in the ancient
tombs, were the heglik (Balanites wgytiaca), the seyal (Acacia
seyal), the sint (Acacia nilotica), the tamarisk (Z’amarix nilotica),
the nebak (Zizyphus spina-Christi), the sycamore-fig (Ficus syco-
morus): and the moringa (Moringa aptera). 'The dom palm (//y-
phene thebaica) and the Dellach palm (77. argun) were also com-
mon. The heglik does not now grow wild north of Aswan, and of
the other trees, only the saint and the tamarisk are really common in
the Lower Nile Valley. All these trees, however, now grow in
abundance in the region north of the Atbara, and it is here, in what is
called the Taka country, that we find also the fauna that was once
so abundant in more northerly regions.

But if the fauna and flora of the Arabian and Libyan Deserts in
dynastic times approached more closely to that now seen in the Taka
country, we have to go further south again for the earliest pre-
dynastic fauna and flora of the Lower Nile Valley. This predynastic
fauna is particularly interesting, because, in addition to several of

440 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

the animals already mentioned as occurring in dynastic times, we
meet with others, such as the elephant,* the kudu (Strepiceros
kudu),* the gerenuk gazelle (Lithocranius walleri), a species of
Sus 1° (which is certainly not the wild boar, 1. e., Sus scrofa), and the
marabou stork (Leptoptilus crumenifer).*° From the nature and
habits of these mammals and birds it is evident that there must have
been a considerable rainfall in the Valley of the Nile north of Aswan
when they frequented Egypt. This evidence sanctions the conclu-
sion that a material change in the character of the climate of North-
eastern Africa, so far as its rainfall is concerned, has taken place
since predynastic days. The flora of the valley of the Lower Nile
also points to the same conclusion. Doctor Schweinfurth’’ has
drawn attention to the fact that many plants, now known in Egypt
only under cultivation, are found in the primeval swamps and forests
of the White Nile. He not unreasonably draws the inference that in
ages long ago the entire Nile Valley exhibited a vegetation harmoniz-
ing in its character throughout much more than at present. The
papyrus swamps and reed marshes that lined the Lower Nile Valley
in pre-agricultural days have been changed into peaceful fields, in
which now grow the cereal grains, wheat and barley, and the other
crops that have made Egypt famous as an agricultural country. It
was the canalization of the valley, carried out by man, and the con-
sequent draining of the swamps and marshes that displaced the an-
cient flora from its northern seat, and made it, as at the present day,
only to be found hundreds of miles higher up the river. The land
of Egypt has, in fact, been drained by man; each foot of ground has
been won by the sweat of his brow with difficulty from the swamp,
until at last the wild plants and animals which once possessed it have
been completely exterminated in it. The agricultural Egypt of
modern times is as much a gift of man as it is of the Nile.

I have dwelt at some length on the ancient fauna and flora because
1 want to bring out as clearly as I can two facts concerning the
Kgypt of pre-agricultural days—the Egypt of the time before man
began to win the alluvial soil for the purposes of agriculture. (1)
The aspect of the Lower Nile must have been very different from
what it is now; it was a continuous line of papyrus swamps and
marshes inhabited by hippopotami, wild boars, crocodiles, and im-
mense flocks of wild fowl of all kinds; it was singularly destitute
of trees or plants that could be put to any useful purpose, and
timber trees were non-existent; its physical conditions resembled

those prevailing on the banks of the White Nile to-day. (2) The
deserts bordering the Lower Nile Valley on both sides were much
more fertile, and their fauna and flora resembled that of the Taka
country in Upper Nubia. Of the animals that frequented the
wadies only the ass and the wild ox were capable of domestication.
If man inhabited Egypt in pre-agricultural times—and there is no
valid reason to suppose that he did not—he probably lived a wan-
dering life, partly hunter, partly herdsman, in the fertile wadies
that bordered the valley, only going down to the river to fish or
to fowl or to hunt the hippopotamus. In the valley itself there
was certainly no pasture land for supporting herds of large
or small cattle. It was probably also in these wadies that agri-
culture was first practiced in Egypt. Even at the present day a
considerable number of Ababdeh roam the wadies of the Arabian
Desert between Keneh and the Red Sea, where, at certain seasons
of the year, there is fair pasturage for small flocks of sheep and
goats. I have myself seen many of these people in the course of
several journeys that I have undertaken to the Red Sea coast.
Some of these nomads sow a little barley and millet after a rain-
storm, and then pitch their tents for a while till the grain grows,
ripens, and can be gathered. They then move on again with their
little flocks. What the Ababdeh do on a very small scale, the
Hadendoa of the Taka country do on a much greater one.

If we turn to the Taka country we see there people living under
much the same physical conditions as those which must have pre
vailed in the Arabian and Libyan deserts in early times. The
inhabitants of the Taka country are Hamite, and, as Professor
Seligman has pointed out,!* the least modified of these people are
physically identical with the predynastic Egyptians of Upper Egypt.
I would suggest that they, like the fauna and flora of ancient Egypt,
receded southward under the pressure of the advance of civilization,
and that the physical conditions of the country have preserved
them to a great extent in their primitive life and pursuits. The
picture of the Taka as Burckhardt draws it would, I believe, describe
almost equally well the earliest predynastic Egyptians. This coun-
try, called £1 Gash by its inhabitants, has been described by Burck-
bardt.4® In his day the people there were in the transition stage
between the pastoral nomad and the agriculturist. It was a fertile
and populous region. About the end of June large torrents coming
from the south and southwest pour over the country, and in the
space of a fortnight or so cover the whole surface with a sheet of
water, varying in depth from 2 to 3 feet. These torrents were
said to lose themselves in the eastern plain after inundating the

449 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

country, but the waters remained upward of a month in Taka, and
on subsiding left a thick slime or mud upon the surface. Imme-
diately after the inundation was imbibed the Bedawin sowed their
seed upon the mud, without any previous preparation whatever.
The inundation was usually accompanied by heavy rains, which set
in a short time before the inundation, and became most copious dur-
ing its height. The rains lasted some weeks longer than the inun-
dation; they were not incessant, but fell in heavy showers at short
intervals. Inthe winter and spring the people of Taka obtained their
water from deep wells, extremely copious, dispersed all over the coun-
try, but at a considerable distance from each other. The people ap-
peared to be ignorant of tillage; they had no regular fields, and the
millet, their only grain, was sown among thorny trees. After the
harvest was gathered the peasants returned to their pastoral occupa-
tions. When Burckhardt visited this region in the hottest part of the
year, just before the period of the rains, the ground was quite parched
up, and he saw but few cattle; the herds were sent to the Eastern
Desert, where they fed in the mountains and fertile valleys, and
where springs of water were found. After the inundation they were
brought back to the plain. The quantity of cattle, Burckhardt be-
lieved, would have been greater than it was had it not been for the
wild beasts which inhabited the district and destroyed great num-
bers of them. The most common of these wild animals were the lion
and the leopard. The flocks of the encampment were driven in the
evening into the area within the circle of tents, which were them-
selves surrounded by a thorny inclosure. Great numbers of asses
were kept by all these Bedawin. ‘They also possessed many camels.
The trees are described as being full of pigeons. The Hadendoa
were the only inhabitants of Taka seen by Burckhardt. Each tribe
had a couple of large villages built in the desert on the border of the
cultivable soil, where some inhabitants were always to be found, and
to which the population, excepting those who tended the cattle in the
interior of the desert, repaired during the rainy season. After the
waters had subsided they spread over the whole district, pitching their
camps in those places where they hoped for the best pasturage, and
moved about from month to month, until the sun parched up the
herbage. The settlers in the villages meantime sowed the ground
adjoining the neighboring desert. The camps consisted of huts
formed of mats; there were also a few huts with walls, resembling
those in the countries of the Nile, but smaller. Even the settlers,
however, preferred living in the open under sheds to inhabiting these
close dwellings.

It has often been stated that civilization in Egypt spread from
the south, and considerable stress has been laid upon the fact that so
many predynastic and early dynastic remains have been found in

RD.
EGYPT—-NEWBERRY 443

Upper Egypt in the region between Edfu and Thinis, especially at
Hierakonpolis and Naqada, and north of Naqada, in the neighbor-
hood of Abydos. Opposite Edfu is a desert route leading to the Red
Sea; at Kiaft, opposite Naqada, is the beginning of the road leading
to Kosér, the port on the Red Sea. It has been thought that the
people who brought culture to Egypt reached the Nile Valley by one
or by both these routes from a “God’s Land” situated somewhere
down the Red Sea coast. But throughout the whole history of
Egypt culture has always come from the north and spread south-
ward.

From a study of the monuments of the First Dynasty that had
been found at Abydos and elsewhere in Upper Egypt I ventured,
nearly twenty years ago,” to suggest the existence in predynastic
times of a Delta civilization which, in culture, was far advanced be-
yond that of Upper Egypt, and I pointed out that it was probably
to a Delta civilization that the dynastic Egyptians owed their system
of writing. I was led to this conclusion by the following facts.
Although many predynastic cemeteries had been thoroughly explored
in Upper Egypt, no grave had yielded a single fragment of hiero-
glyphic writing. The only inference that can be drawn from this is
that hieroglyphic writing was unknown, or at all events unpracticed,
by the inhabitants of Upper Egypt before dynastic times. On the
other hand, the discoveries at Naqada, Hierakonpolis, and Abydor
had shown us that all the essential features of the Egyptian systen
of writing were fully developed at the beginning of the First
Dynasty. Hieroglyphic signs were already in full use as simple
phonograms, and their employment as phonetic complements was
well established. Determinative signs are found beginning to ap
pear in these early writings, but, as Erman and Griffith have noticed.
even as late as the Fifth Dynasty, their use was very restricted in
the monumental inscriptions, although they were common in the
cursive and freely written texts of the Pyramids. At the very
beginning of the First Dynasty the numerical system was complete
up to millions, and the Egyptians had already worked out a solar
year of 365 days. This was indeed a remarkable achievement.

These facts are of great significance, for it is clear that the hiero-
glyphic system of writing, as we find it at the beginning of the First
Dynasty, must have been the growth of many antecedent ages, and
yet no trace of the early stages of its evolution has been found on
Upper Egyptian soil. There is no clear evidence, hc wever, that the
system was borrowed from any country outside Egypt; the fauna and
flcra of its characters give it every appearance of being indigenous.
It is apparent, therefore, that we must seek the cradle of the Egyp-

2 Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archeology, February, 1906, p. 69.
444 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

tian system of hieroglypric writing elsewhere than in Upper Egypt,
and as the fauna and flora of its characters are distinctly Egyptian
the presumption is that it must be located to the Delta. An import-
ant indication as to the original home of Egyptian writing is given
by the signs which, in historic times, were used to designate the
peints of the compass. The sign for “east” was a drop-shaped ingot
of metal upon a sacred perch, and this was the cult object of a clan
living in predynastic times in the Eastern Delta. The sign for
“west” was an ostrich feather placed in a semicircular stand, and this
was the cult object of the people of the Western Delta. The sign
for “south” was a scirpus reed; this was the cult object of a clan
which dwelt on the east bank of the Nile a little above the mcdern
village of Sharona, in Middle Egypt. The country south of the
apex of the Delta was known as 7a Shema, “Reed Land.” It must,
therefore, have been at some point north of the apex of the Delta that
the scirpus reed was first used to designate the south. It must also
have been somewhere in the Central Delta that the cult objects of the
peoples of the Eastern and Western Delta were first used to designate
“east” and “west.”

For the Delta being the early home of writing another fact has to
be taken into consideration. Thoth, the Ibis god, was to the Egyp-
tians the god of writing, and it was to him that they attributed its
invention. The principal seat of his worship in historic times was
Hermopolis, in Middle Egypt. But Thoth’s original habitat was
situated in the northeast corner of the Delta, where, in pre-
dynastic times, had resided an Ibis clan. The tradition that named
Thoth as the god and inventor of writing would, therefore, point
Deltawards. This tradition is significant also in another way.
Although we can not doubt that the Egyptian system of writing was
evolved in the Delta, the germs of writing may have come into Egypt
from Western Asia via this northeast corner of the country. In this
connection it may be pointed out that the hieroglyphic signs for
“right” and “left” were the same as those for “west” and “east”; the
Egyptians who evolved the hieroglyphic system of writing orientated
themselves facing south.

It is remarkable that so little is known about the early history of
the Delta. But few excavations have been carried out there, and noth-
ing of predynastic, or early dynastic, times, has, so far, been brought
to light from the country north of Cairo. We do know, however,
that before the arrival of the Falcon kings from Hierakonpolis in
the south, Middle and Lower Egypt had been, probably for many
centuries, united under one scepter, and that before these two parts
of the country were united there had been a Delta Kingdom which
had had its capital at Sais. The names of some of these early kings
are preserved on the Palermo fragment of the famous Annals Tablet,

EGYPT—-NEWBERRY 445

and the list there given would alone be enough to prove how ancient
the Delta civilization must have been. There was certainly nothing
comparable with it in Upper Egypt in those far-off days.

What were the physical conditions prevailing in the Delta and in
the regions to the east and west of it immediately preceding Menes’
arrival in Lower Egypt? For the eastern side the evidence is ex-
ceedingly scanty, but there is one fact which is significant. The
chief god of the eastern nomes of the Delta in the Pyramid Age was
Anzety, a pastoral deity who was the prototype of Osiris. He is
represented as a man holding in one hand the shepherd’s crook,
and in the other the goatherd’s ladanisterion. There can be little
doubt, therefore, that in the eastern Delta there lived a pastoral
people who possessed flocks of sheep and goats, and this is evidence
of a certain amount of grassland. In the Central Delta at the same
period there lived a series of clans, among which a Bull Clan was
predominant. In historic times in Egypt the ox is often figured
roaming in papyrus and reed marshes, and it may be that the Cen-
tral Delta marshes supported herds of domesticated cattle. Much
more is known about the western side of the Delta at the time of
Menes. It formed, I believe, part of what was called Tehenu-land,
at all events this name was given to the region immediately to the
west of the Canopic branch of the Nile. There can be no doubt
that this part of the country was a very fertile and prosperous
region in the period immediately preceding the First Dynasty. Its
name signifies “ Olive-land,” and we actually see these trees figured,
with the name of the country beside them, on a predynastic Slate
Palette; on this Palette, above the trees, are shown oxen, asses, and
sheep of the type later known as ser-sheep. It was Menes,”* the
Falcon King of Upper Egypt, who conquered the people of Tehenu-
land. This conquest is recorded on a small ivory cylinder that was
found at Hierakonpolis. Another record of the Southerner’s
triumph over these people is preserved on his famous Slate Palette;
here the Upper Egyptian King is depicted smiting their chieftain,
while on the verso of the same Palette is the scene of a festival at
the Great Port, which was perhaps situated near the Canopic branch
of the Nile. The mace head of Menes, which is now in the Ash-
molean Museum at Oxford, has a scene carved upon it which shows
the king assuming the red crown of Sais, and the inscription accom-
panying it records that he had captured 120,000 prisoners, 400,000
oxen, and 1,422,000 goats. This immense number of oxen and goats
is clear evidence that the northwestern Delta and the region to the
west of it (Tehenu-land) must have included within its boundaries

21 That Narmer was Menes is proved by a sealing published by Petrie in Royal Tombs of
the Earliest Dynasties, Plate XIII, 98. His conquest of Tehenu-land is recorded on an
ivory cylinder published by Quibell, Hierakonpolis I, Plate XV, 7.

very extensive grasslands. Several centuries after Menes, Sahure,
a king of the Fifth Dynasty, captured in Tehenu-land 123,440 oxen,
233,400 asses, 232,413 goats, and 243,688 sheep. Senusret I. also
captured in the same region “cattle of all kinds without number.”
This again shows how fertile the country must have been at the
beginning of the Middle Kingdom. ‘The history of this part of
the Delta is most obscure. During the period that elapsed from
the end of the Third Dynasty to the beginning of the Twenty-third,
when Tefnakht appears upon the scene, we have hardly any in-
formation about it. What was happening at Sais and other great
cities in the northwest of Egypt during the period from 2900 to
720 B. C.? There is an extraordinary lacuna in our knowledge of
this part of the country. The people living there were certainly
of Libyan descent, for even as late as the time of Herodotus the
inhabitants deemed themselves Libyans, not Egyptians; and the
Greek historian says that they did not even speak the Egyptian
language. The predynastic people who inhabited the greater part
of the Lower Nile Valley were apparently of the same stock as these
Libyans. There is a certain class of decorated pottery which has
been found in predynastic graves from Gizeh in the north to
Kostamneh in the south. On this decorated pottery are figured
boats with cult-objects raised on poles. Altogether some 170° vases
of this type are known, and on them are 300 figures of boats with
cult-signs. Of these, 124 give the “Harpoon” ensign; 78 the
“Mountain” ensign; and 20 the “Crossed Arrows” ensign. These
cult-objects all survived into historic times; the “ Harpoon” was
the cult-object of the people of the Mareotis Lake region; the
“ Mountain” and “ Crossed Arrows” were the cult-objects of the
people dwelling on the right bank of the Canopic branch of the Nile.
Thus it will be seen that out of 300 boats figured on vases found in
graves in the Lower Nile Valley south of Cairo, 222 belong to cults
which can be located in the northwestern corner of the Delta.
Twenty-two boats bear the “Tree” ensign, which was the early
cult object of the people of Herakleopolis, a city just south of the
Fayim. Ten bear the “Thunderbolt” ensign of Ekhmim. The
“Falcon” on a curved perch appears on three boats, and this ensign
undoubtedly represents the Falcon deity of Hierakonpolis. At the
beginning of the historic period the cult objects of the people of
the northwestern Delta included (1) the “ Harpoon,” (2) the figure-
of-eight “Shield with Crossed Arrows,” (3) the “Mountain,” and
probably (4) the “ Double Axe,” 2? and (5) a “ Dove or Swallow.” 22
With the exception of the “ Harpoon” all these cult objects are also
found in Crete, a fact which is significant in view of Sir Arthur

The Cults of the Double Axe and of the Dove or Swallow are found on monuments of
the Pyramid Age.

Evans’s remark, quoted at the beginning of my address, to the effect
that he considers the possibility of some actual immigration into the
island of the older Egyptian element due to the first Pharaohs. The
“Harpoon,” it should be noted, is the prototype of the bident, and
later, of the trident of the Libyan god Poseidon.

Upon the mace-head of Menes, the king is represented assuming
the crown of Neith of Sais. This is the earliest representation of the
famous Sed festival which is generally held to be a survival, in a
much weakened form, of the ceremonial killing of the king, its essen-
tial feature being regarded as the identification of the king with the
god Osiris. The festival was, I believe, of Libyan origin, and, at all
events in its origin, it was not connected in any way with Osiris. On
this mace-head the Upper Egyptian conqueror is shown seated under
a canopy upon a dais raised high above the ground. He is clad in a
long, close-fitting garment; upon his head is the red crown of Sais,
and in one of his hands is the so-called flail. Behind him is a group
of officials, and upon either side of the dais are two fan bearers. In
front of the king is a princess seated in a palanquin, and behind her
are three men figured in the act of running. This is the earliest of
a long series of representations of the festival, and we can not doubt
that the particular ceremony here depicted was the central one around
which, in later times, the other ceremonies that we know were con-
nected with it were grouped. There is no indication here of any
ceremonial killing of the king, and the red crown which Menes
wears is not characteristic of Osiris but of the goddess Neith of Sais.
In the Mortuary Temple of Neuserre at Abusir, in the Temple of
Amenhotep III, at Soleb in Nubia, and in the Temple of Osorkon
III, at Bubastis, the Sed festival is represented in far greater detail,
but still there is no indication of the ceremonial killing of the king,
or of his identification with Osiris. These later scenes show that the
festival was a great national one that was attended by all the great
dignitaries of state, and by the priests of the gods from all the prin-
cipal cities of Egypt. In these later representations the king’s
daughters and the running men play an important part. Inscrip-
tions accompanying the scenes at Soleb** and Bubastis state that the
king at this festival assumed the protection of Egypt and of the
sacred women of the Temple of Amon. The Queen at these periods
of Egyptian history was the High Priestess of Amon and the Head
of the Harim of the god. An important reference to the festival is
found in the inscription of Piankhy. This Ethiopian king, in his
triumphant march from Thebes toward the Delta, had captured
Hermopolis, the capital of a petty king named Namlot (a Libyan
Dynast), and when Piankhy made his entry into the city he was

221 owe my knowledge of the greater part of the Soleb scenes to Prof. Breasted, who
kindly showed me unpublished drawings of them when I visited him in Chicago in 1921.
448 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

acclaimed by the people, who prayed that he would celebrate there
a Sed festival. “His Majesty proceeded to the palace of Namlot,
and entered every chamber. He caused that there be brought to
him the king’s wives and the king’s daughters. They saluted His
Majesty in the fashion of women,” but the Ethiopian says that he
would not turn his face to them, and he did not celebrate a Sed
festival. The most important point in connection with the festival
is that at it the king assumed the protection of the land of Egypt.
It was a kind of coronation festival. On Menes’s mace head the king
is shown assuming the red crown, while before him is the princess
of the country that he had conquered, and below her is a statement
of the number of prisoners and cattle captured by him in her
country.
Now what were the rules that regulated the succession to the king-
ship in Ancient Egypt? It is often assumed that the kingship was
hereditary in the male line, and that the son regularly succeeded his
father on the throne. But we know that many Egyptian kings were
not the sons of their predecessors. We also know that at some pe-
riods, at all events, the sovereign based his claim to the kingship upon
the fact that he had married the hereditary princess. Harmhab, at
the beginning of the Nineteenth Dynasty, tells us that he proceeded
to the palace at Thebes, and there, in the Great House (pr-wr),
married the hereditary princess. Then the gods, “the lords of the
House of Flame (pr-nsrt), were in exultation because of his corona-
tion, and they prayed Amon that he would grant to Harmhab the
Sed festivals of Re.” It was after his marriage to the princess that
Harmhab’s titulary was fixed. The reference to the House of Flame
is interesting because the kindling of fire was an important ceremony
at the Sed festival; it is figured at Soleb, and there a priestess
called “the Divine Mother of Suit” plays an important role. This
priestess may be compared with Vesta, who always bore the official
title of “ Mother,” never that of “ Virgin.” It is unnecessary for
me to speak of the King’s fire and the vestal virgins whose duty it
was to keep the perpetual fire burning; the material has been col-
lected by Sir James Frazer. This ceremony of kindling fire suggests
that the festival may have been a marriage festival, and the running
men figured on the mace head of Menes, and in later representa-
tions, also points to this interpretation of it. There can be little
doubt that it was a Libyan festival; at all events it is first found
when Menes assumed the red crown of Neith of Sais. When Menes
had conquered the northwestern Delta, he married the hereditary
princess of the country. She was probably the eldest daughter, or
perhaps the widow, of the Lower Egyptian king whose country he
had seized. Marriage with the king’s widow or eldest daughter car-
ried the throne with it as a matter of right, and Menes’s marriage,

EGYPT—-NEWBERRY 449

we can well believe, was a marriage of policy in order to clinch by
a legal measure his claim to that crown which he had already won
for himself in battle. Sir James Frazer has noted that sometimes
apparently the right to the hand of the princess and to the throne
has been determined by a race. The Libyan king Antzus placed his
daughter Barce at the end of a race course; her noble suitors, both
Libyans and foreigners, ran to her as the goal, and the one who
touched her first gained her in marriage. The Alitemnian Libyans
awarded the kingdom to the fleetest runner. According to tradition,
the earliest games at Olympia were held by Endymion, who set his
sons to run a race for the kingdom. In all the ceremonies connected
with the Sed festival I can see no feature that suggests the Osirifi-
cation of the king. When he wears the red crown he assumes con-
trol of Lower Egypt; when he wears the white crown he assumes
control of Upper Egypt. There is one further point connected with
the western side of the Delta that must be noted. Glazeware (and
glass) in Egyptian is called tehent,; this was one of the chief articles
of export of Tehenu-land. Just as we use the word “china” for a
kind of porcelain which first came to us from China, so the Egyp-
tians called glass ¢hn.t after the country of the northwestern Delta
from which they derived it. Here in this western side of Lower
Egypt is an almost wholly unexplored field for the anthropologist.

I have already referred to the pastoral deity Anzety, who, in the
Pyramid Age, was chief of the nomes of the Eastern Delta. Among
all the nome gods he is the only one that is figured in human form;
he stands erect holding in his right hand the shepherd’s crook
and in his left the goatherd’s ladanisterion. On his head is a bi-
cornate object that is connected with goats, and on his chin is a
false beard curled at the tip. He was not an ox herd, but a shepherd
and goatherd. In later times, the figure of this deity, in hieroglyphic
writing, is regularly used as the determinative sign of the word
ity, “ruling prince,” “sovereign,” a term that is only applied to the
living king. In the Pyramid texts, Anzety is entitled “Head of
the Eastern nomes,” and these included the ancient one of the
Oxyrrhynchus fish, where, later, the ram or goat was the chief
cult animal. Neither the domesticated sheep nor the goat can be
reckoned as Egyptian in origin; they both came into Egypt from
Western Asia. We have, therefore, in this pastoral deity Anzety
evidence of immigration from the west. The only wild sheep
inhabiting the continent of Africa is the Barbary sheep, and this
animal was not the ancestor of any domesticated breed. Both the
sheep and the goat are essentially mountain animals, though sheep
in the wild state do not as a rule frequent such rugged and
precipitous ground as their near relatives the goats, but prefer more
open country. Sheep browse in short grass; goats feed upon the
450 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

young shoots of shrubs and trees. The domesticated goat is gen-
erally recognized as descended from the wild goat (Capra hircus
egagrus) of Syria, Asia Minor, Persia, and the Mediterranean
Isles. Two breeds of domesticated sheep were known to the
Egyptians. The sheep of the earliest historical period down to the
Middle Kingdom was a long-legged variety (Ovis longipes), with
horns projecting transversely and twisted. This breed was the only
one known in the earlier periods of Egyptian history; it was the
predominant breed in the Middle Kingdom, but soon after the be-
ginning of the Empire it appears to have become rare or extinct in
Egypt, and was superseded by a variety with horns curving for-
wards in a subcircular coil. Both varieties of domesticated sheep,
according to Lydekker, were introduced into Egypt through Syria.

Among the cult-objects of the cities over which the god Anzety
presided were two, which, I believe, can definitely be referred to
trees that were not indigenous to the soil of Egypt but to Syria.
One of these cult objects is the so-called “Ded column.” ‘This was
one of the holiest symbols of the Egyptian religion. It has four
crossbars at the top like superposed capitals. Sometimes a pair of
human eyes are shown upon it, and the pillar is draped; sometimes
a human form is given to it by carving a grotesque face on it, rob-
ing the lower part, crowning the top with ram’s horns, and adding
two arms, the hands holding the crook and ladanisterion. Frazer
has suggested that this object might very well be a conventional
representation of a tree stripped of its leaves. That it was, in
fact, a lopped tree is, I believe, certain. In the Pyramid texts it
is said of Osiris, “'Thou receivest thy two oars, the one of juniper
(wan), the other of sd-wood, and thou ferriest over the Great Green
Sea.” The determinative sign of the word sd is a tree of precisely
the same form as the Ded column that is figured on early Egyptian
monuments, i. e., it has a long, thin stem. This tree-name only
occurs in inscriptions of the Pyramid Age, and it is mentioned as
a wood that was used for making chairs, tables, boxes, and various
other articles of furniture. In the passage quoted from the Pyramid
texts it is mentioned together with juniper, and the latter was em-
ployed in cabinet-making, etc., at all periods of Egyptian history.
There is no evidence that juniper ever grew in Egypt, but we have
numerous records of the wood being imported from the Lebanon
region. The sd-tree, as we see from the determinative sign of the
name, had horizontally spreading branches, and was evidently
some species of conifer. No conifers, however, are known from
Egypt; the sd-wood must, therefore, have been of foreign importa-
tion. As it is mentioned with juniper, which we know came to
Egypt from Syria, it is possible that it came from the same region.
Among the trees of the Lebanon there are four that have hori- —

EGYPT—-NEWBERRY 451

zontally spreading branches. These are the cedar (Cedrus libant),
the Cilician fir, the Pinus laricio, and the horizontal-branched
cypress (Cupressus sempervirens var. horizontales). Much mis-
‘conception at present exists with regard to the Lebanon cedar, be-
cause the name “cedar” is applied to a large number of woods
which are quite distinct from it, and the wood which we generally
call cedar (e. g., the cedar of our “cedar” pencils) is not true cedar
at all, but Virginian juniper. The wood of Cedrus libani is light
and spongy, of a reddish-white color, very apt to shrink and warp
badly, by no means durable, and in no sense is it valuable. Sir
Joseph Hooker, who visited the Lebanon in 1860, notes that the
lower slopes of that mountain region bordering the sea were covered
with magnificient forests of pine, juniper, and cypress, “so that
there was little inducement for the timber hewers of ancient times
to ascend 6,000 feet through 20 miles of a rocky mountain valley
to obtain cedar wood which had no particular quality to recom-
mend it. The cypress, pine, and tall, fragrant juniper of the
Lebanon, with its fine red heartwood, would have been far more
prized on every account than the cedar.” The sd-tree was, I believe,
the horizontal-branched cypress which is common in the wild state.
In the Middle Ages this tree was believed to be the male tree, while
the tapering conical-shaped cypress was considered to be the female.
This is an interesting fact, because there is some evidence to show
that the tapering variety was the symbol of Hathor-Isis, while the
horizontal-branched one was the symbol of Osiris.

In the Pyramid Age there are several records of the priests of the
Ded column. They were called “priests of the venerable Ded
column.” The seat of the cult was Dedu, or, as it was sometimes
called, Pr-Wsr, “the House of Osiris,” the Greek Busiris in the
Central Delta. At this city was celebrated annually a great festival
in honor of Osiris. It lasted many days, and the culmination of
a long series of ceremonies was the raising of the Ded column into
an erect position. Osiris is intimately connected with this column;
the Egyptians called it his backbone. In the myth of Osiris, as
recorded by Plutarch, a pillar played an important part. Plutarch
says that the coffer containing the body of Osiris was washed up
by the sea at Byblos, the port of the Lebanon, and that a tree grew
up and concealed the coffin within itself. This sacred tree was cut
down by Isis and presented to the people of Byblos wrapped in a
linen cloth, and anointed with myrrh like a corpse. It therefore
represented the dead god, and this dead god was Osiris.

Not far from Dedu, the city of Osiris in the Delta, was Hebyt, the
modern Behbeyt el Hagar. Its sacred name was Neter. The
Romans called it Iseum, or Isidis oppidum. It was the ancient seat
of Isis worship in Egypt, and the ruins of its temple to that goddess
452 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

still cover several acres of ground in the neighborhood. On the
analogy of other sacred names of cities the primitive cult-object here
was the ntr-pole. This was not an axe as has so often been sup-
posed, but a pole that was wrapped around with a band of colored
cloth, tied with cord halfway up the stem, with the upper part of the
band projecting as a flap at top. Dr. Griffith conjectured that it was
a fetish, e. g.,a bone carefully wound round with cloth, but he noted
that “this idea is not as yet supported by any ascertained facts.”
As a hieroglyph this wrapped-up pole expresses ntr,“ god,” “ divine,”
in which sense it is very common from the earliest times; gradually
it became determinative of divinity and of the divine names and
ideographic of divinity. Another common ideograph of “god” in
the Old Kingdom was the Falcon (Horus) upon a perch, and this
sign was also employed as a determinative of divinity and of the
names of individual gods; it even sometimes occurs as a determinative
sign of the nér-pole, e. g. Pyramid Texts, 482. This use of the Fal-
con indicates that in the early dynasties the influence of the Upper
Egyptian Falcon god (Horus) was paramount. But there is reason
for believing that the ntr-pole cult had at an earlier period been the
predominant one among the writing people of the Delta; this, I
think, is shown by the invariable use of the nfr-pole sign in the
words for priest (Am-nir, “god’s servant”), and temple (hé-ntr,
“9od’s house”). Now, on a label of King Aha of the First Dynasty
there is a representation of the temple of Neith of Sais. Here two
poles with triangular flags at top are shown on either side of the
entrance. Later figures of the same temple show these poles with
the rectangular flags precisely as we find in the nér-sign. A figure
of the temple of Hershef on the Palermo Stone shows two poles with
triangular flags, while a Fourth Dynasty drawing of the same temple
shows the same poles with rectangular flags. We see, therefore, that
the triangular-flagged pole equals the rectangular-flagged one, and
that the nétr is really a pole or mast with flag. Poles of this kind
were probably planted before the entrances to most early Egyptian
temples, and the great flag masts set up before the pylons of the great
temples of the Eighteenth and later dynasties are obviously sur-
vivals of the earlier poles. The height and straightness of these
poles prove that they can not have been produced by any native
Egyptian tree; in the Empire flag staves were regularly imported
from Syria; it is probable therefore that in the earlier times they
were introduced from the same source. A well-known name for
Syria and the east coast of the Red Sea, as well as of Punt, was
Ta-ntr, “the land of the ntr-pole.” This was the region in which the
primitive Semitic goddess Astarte was worshipped. In Canaan
there was a goddess Ashera whose idol or symbol was the ashera
pole. The names of Baal and Ashera are sometimes coupled pre-

EGYPT—NEWBERRY 453

cisely as those of Baal and Astarte, and many scholars have inferred
that Ashera was only another name of the great Semitic goddess
Astarte. The ashera pole was an object of worship, for the prophets
put it on the same line with the sacred symbols, such as Baal pillars;
the ashera was, therefore, a sacred symbol, the seat of a deity, the
mark of a divine presence. In late times these asherim did not ex-
clusively belong to any one deity; they were erected to Baal as well
as to Yahw. They were signposts set up to mark sacred places, and
they were, moreover, draped. They correspond exactly to the ntr-
poles of Egyptian historic times. I have noted that these nér-poles
were tall and straight. What tree produced them? In Egyptian
inscriptions there is often mentioned a tree named ¢r.t. It was oc-
casionally planted in ancient Egyptian gardens, and specimens of it
were to be seen in the Temple garden at Heliopolis. The seeds and
sawdust were employed in medicine, and its resin. was one of the
ingredients of the Kyphi-incense. Chaplets were made of its twigs
and leaves. The tree was sacred to Hathor; branches of it were
offered by the Egyptian kings to that goddess. In a Saite text it is
mentioned with three other trees—pine, yew, and juniper; these are
all found in Northern Syria, where they grow together with the
cypress; the ¢r.¢ tree may therefore be the cypress. Evidence has
been brought forward to show that the sd-tree is the horizontal-
branched cypress, which was believed to be a male tree, while the
tapering, flame-shaped cypress was believed to be the female tree.
The Ded column was the symbol of Osiris, and at Busiris was cele-
brated a festival of raising this column. The ¢r.¢ tree was sacred to
Hathor, who is often identified with Isis, and there was a festival of
raising the ¢r.t tree that was celebrated on the nineteenth day of the |
first month of the winter season. It is not known where this festival
was celebrated, but it may well have been at Neter, the seat of the
Isis cult near Dedu-Busiris. The two tree-cults point to Northern
Syria as the country of their origin.

In the architecture of ancient Egypt two distinct styles can be
recognized. One is founded on wattle-and-daub, the other on wood
construction. Wattle-and-daub is the natural building material of
the Nile Valley and Delta, and the architectural forms derived from
it are certainly indigenous. Those styles derived from wood con-
struction, on the other hand, could not have originated in Egypt, but
must have arisen in a country where the necessary timber was ready
at hand. Egypt produces no coniferous trees and no timber that is
at all suitable for building purposes, or indeed for carpenter’s work
of any description. The wood of the sycamore fig is very coarse-
grained, and no straight planks can be cut from it. The siint-acacia
is so hard that it requires to be sawn while it is green; it is very
454 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

irregular in texture, and on account of the numerous branches of the
trunk it is impossible to cut it into boards more than a couple of feet
in length. The palaces of the early kings of the Delta were built of

coniferous wood hung with tapestry-woven mats. The tomb of |

Menes’ queen, Neith-hotep, at Naqada, was built of brick in imitation
of one of these timber-constructed palaces, and smaller tombs of the
same kind are known from the Second and Third Dynasties, but not
later. As early as the reign of King Den (First Dynasty) the
palaces of this type were beginning to be built of the native wattle-
and-daub in combination with wood, and by the end of the Pyramid
Age the style disappears entirely, though the memory of it was
preserved in the false doors of the tombs and stele. Brick buildings
similar to those of the “ palace” style of Egypt are also known from
early Babylonia, and they were at one time regarded as peculiarly
characteristic of Sumerian architecture. These, obviously, must
have been copied, like the Egyptian, from earlier timber forms. In
Babylonia, as in Egypt, timber was scarce, and there are records
that it was sometimes obtained from the coast of Syria. This was
the region from which the Egyptians throughout historic times ob-
tained their main supplies of wood, so it is not improbable that they,
as well as the Sumerians, derived this particular style of architecture
from Northern Syria. I may observe in passing that in this
“palace” style we have the transition form between the nomad’
tent and the permanent building of a settled people. The lack of
native timber in Egypt is significant in another direction. Boats of
considerable size are figured on many predynastic monuments. They
are long and narrow, and in the middle there is usually figured a reed
or wicker-work cabin. In my view these boats were built, like many
of those of later periods in Egypt, of bundles of papyrus reeds bound
together with cord; they were, in fact, great canoes, and, of course,
were only for river traffic. They were not sailing boats, but were
propelled by means of oars. No mast is ever figured with them, but
they generally have a short pole amidships which is surmounted by
a cult-object. On one predynastic vase there is a figure of a sailing
ship, but this is totally different in build from the canoes, and it has
a very high bow and stern with its mast set far forward in the hull.
Similar vessels are figured on the ivory knife handle of predynastic
date from Gebel el Araq, but these vessels appear to be in port and
the sails are evidently lowered. I have already referred to the Great
Port mentioned on the Palette of Menes. A port implies shipping
and trade relations with people dwelling along the coast or across the
sea. It may be that the people of the northwestern Delta built
wooden ships, but if they did they must have procured their timber
from some foreign source. Coniferous wood was already being im-
ported into the Nile Valley at the beginning of the First Dynasty

from the Lebanon region, and it must be remembered that the
Egyptian. name for a seagoing ship, was kbnyt, from Keben,
“ Byblos,” the port of the Lebanon, where these ships must have been
built and from whence they sailed. The sacred barks of the princi-
pal gods of Egypt in historic times were invariably built of conif-
erous wood from the Lebanon. ‘Transport ships on the Nile were
sometimes built of the native stint wood, and Herodotus describes
them as made of planks about 2 cubits long which were put together
“brick fashion.” No masts or sail-yards, however, could possibly
be cut from any native Egyptian tree. In the Sudan at the present
day masts are sometimes made by splicing together a number of
small pieces of siint and binding them with oxhide, but such masts
are extremely liable to start in any gale, and they would be useless
for seagoing ships. It may be doubted whether the art of building
seagoing ships originated in Egypt. It may be doubted also whether
the custom of burying the dead in wooden coffins originated in Egypt.
In countries where a tree is a rarity a plank for a coffin is generally
unknown. In the Admonitions of an Egyptian Sage, written some
time before 2000 B. C., at a period when there was internal strife in
Egypt, the sage laments that “Men do not sail northward to
[Byb]-los** to-day. What shall we do for coniferous trees ** for our
mummies, with the produce of which priests are buried, and with the
oil of which [chiefs] are embalmed as far as Keftiu? They come
no more.” This ancient sage raises another anthropological question
when he refers to the oil used for embalming. The only oils pro-
duced by native trees or shrubs in Egypt were olive oil, ben oil from
the moringa, and castor oil from the castor-oil plant. The resins
and oils used for embalming were principally those derived from
pines and other coniferous trees. Egypt produced no kinds of in-
cense trees or shrubs. The common incenses were pine resin, lada-
num, and myrrh, and all these were imported. It is difficult to be-
lieve that the ceremonial use of incense arose in Egypt.

These are a few of the questions raised by a study of the material
relating to the origins of the ancient civilization of Egypt. There
are numbers of others that are waiting to be dealt with. Egypt is
extraordinarily rich in material for the anthropologist. It is a
storehouse full of the remains of man’s industry from pre-agricul-
tural times right down to the present day. Almost every foot of
ground hides some relic of bygone man. The climatic conditions
prevailing there are exceptional, and it is largely owing to the
absence of rain that so full a record of man and his works has been

preserved. Jor more than a century excavators have been busy in
many parts of the country, but there is yet no sign that the soil is
becoming exhausted; it is, in fact, almost daily yielding up its buried
treasures. The past two or three decades have been prolific in sur-
prises. Mines of hidden wealth have been unearthed where but a
few years ago we only saw the sands and rocky defiles of the desert.
Since we met at Hull last year, the most sensational archeological
discovery of modern times has been made in a place that had been
abandoned by many excavators as exhausted. This discovery, due
to the untiring persistence of an Englishman, promises to yield re-
sults of extraordinary interest, but it will take years before they can
be adequately published. Other discoveries have been made in Egypt
during recent years which have opened out a vista of human history
that we little dreamt of a quarter of a century ago. Three decades
ago not a single monument was known that could be ascribed with
certainty to the period before the Third Egyptian Dynasty. To-day
We possess a continuous series of written documents which carry
us back to Menes, the founder of the Monarchy, some 3,400 years
or more before our era. These written documents, moreover, show
clearly that Menes himself must have come at the end of a very
long period of development. Egypt had already had a long history
when the upper and lower countries were first united under a single
sceptre. From Upper Egypt we possess a continuous series of un-
inscribed monuments which take us back far into prehistoric times.
An immense vista has been opened out before our eyes by the dis-
coveries of the last thirty years, and now, in Egypt better than in
any other country in the world, we can see man passing from the
primitive hunter to the pastoral nomad, from the pastoral nomad
to the agriculturalist, and then on to the civilized life which begins
with the art of writing. We can see in the Delta and in the Lower
Nile Valley tribes becoming permanently settled in fixed abodes
around primitive cult centers, and then uniting with others into one
community. We can trace the fusion of several communities into
single States, and then, later, the uniting of States under a supreme
sovereign. What other country in the world preserves such a record
of its early history?

I have but little time left to speak of the modern Egyptians, but to
the anthropologist few people are more interesting. In almost every
circumstance of daily life we see the old in the new. Most of the
ceremonies from birth to burial are not Muslim, or Christian, or
Roman, or Greek; they are ancient Egyptian. In the transition of a
people from one religion to another the important institutions of the
older doctrine are generally completely abolished; many ceremonies
and much unessential detail, however, survive, and in the Delta and

Lower Nile Valley survivals are extraordinarily numerous. It was
Lady Duff Gordon who said that Egypt is a palimpsest in which
the Bible is written over Herodotus, and the Koran over that; the
ancient writing is still legible through all. There is a passage in one
of her letters which describes her visit to some Nubian women.
Their dress and ornaments were the same as those represented in
the ancient tomb paintings. Their hair was arranged in little plaits,
finished off with lumps of yellow clay burnished like golden tags.
In their house Lady Duff Gordon sat on a couch of ancient
Egyptian design, with a semicircular headrest. They brought
her dates in a basket such as you may see in the British Mu-
seum. So closely did they and their surroundings resemble
the scenes of the ancient tombs that she says she felt inclined
to ask them how many thousand years old they were! The
modern worship of the people is full of the ancient; many of the
sacred animals and trees have taken service with Muslim saints. Up
to a few years ago cats were still fed by the “Servant of Cats” in
the Kadi’s court in Cairo. Cobras are still held in great reverence in
the city of the Khalifs. Some time ago the director of the Zoological
Gardens in Cairo told me that it was most difficult to procure cobras
for the gardens. It was not because they were scarce, but because
the demand for them was so great that the price asked was far more
than the Government would pay. Many cobras, I was told, were
kept in the upper rooms of houses in the native quarters of the city.
The funeral customs of the people throughout the country are much
the same as those which prevailed in ancient times. It is not only
among the merchant and agricultural classes that we find the Old in the
New. Mrs. Poole, the sister of the Arabic scholar Edward Lane, writ-
ing from Cairo in 1846, describes the scenes in one of Mohammed Ali’s
palaces on the death of a princess of the royal family. Immedia-
ately the royal lady breathed her last, her relations and slaves broke
up all the beautiful china and glass which had been her property.
“The destruction after a death,” Mrs. Poole remarks, “is gener-
ally proportioned to the possessions of the deceased; therefore, in
this case, it was very extensive.” Many, perhaps most, of the festi-
vals of the country are of ancient origin. In the Delta towns and
villages there are several which are similar to those that were held
there in ancient days. It is the same in Upper Egypt. Thebes still
possesses its sacred boat, and on the festival commemorating the
birthday of Luxor’s patron saint, Abu’l Haggag, this lineal descend-
ant of the sacred bark of Amon decorated with flags and gaily col-
ored bits of cloth, is drawn around the town in procession, amid the
acclamations of the people. Modern Egypt has hardly been touched
by the anthropologist. The Government official usually holds him-
458 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

self far too aloof to ever really get into intimate contact with the
native. Edward Lane did much to record the manners and cus-
toms of the Cairene Egyptian, but he never lived among the fellahin,
and his book contains little about the modern dweller on the banks of
the Nile outside Cairo. A rich harvest awaits any student who,
knowing the language, will settle and live throughout the year
among the peasants in any village or town in the Lower Nile Valley.
or Delta. It is only in this way that a real knowledge of the people
can be obtained. Far less is known about them than about many a
tribe in Central Africa.

Thucydides, in the preface to his “ History,” proposed to record
past facts as a basis of rational provision in regard to the future,
but he was not the first to whom this great thought had occurred.
A thousand years before the Greek historian was born an old vizier
of Egypt said of himself that he was “skilled in the ways of the
past,” and that “the things of yesterday ” caused him “to know to-
morrow.” Anthropology, the science of man and civilization, aims
~ at discovering the general laws which have governed human history
in the past and may be expected to regulate it in the future. The
Egyptian vizier had, at most, a couple of thousand years of recorded
history before him. Since his time the area of history has been ever
widening, and we ourselves can look back over nearly six thousand
years of human endeavor. We know considerably more of the past
than did our forefathers, and though those who hold the reins of
government do not usually learn by experience, the anthropologist
ought to be able to predict a little better than the politician about
the future. For thousands of years Egypt has been under foreign
rule. It has been under the yoke of Ethiopian and Persian kings,
under the Greek and Roman, Arab and Ottoman conquerors. Its
people suffered three thousand years of oppression. For the last
forty years it has had English justice. Egypt has this year been
handed back to the Egyptians. It is an Oriental country. What
will be the immediate future of its people? It is not difficult to
predict. Seventy years ago, when Egypt was under the sway of
Said Pasha, there was current among the fellahin of Thebes a little
parable, and with this I will conclude. I quote it as it was taken
down by Rhind in the fifties of last century, but the story was still
remembered when I lived among the natives of Upper Egypt twenty-
eight years ago. It runs thus:

“Tt happened once that a sultan captured a lion, which it pleased
lim to keep for his royal pleasure. An officer was appointed
especially to have in charge the well-being of the beast, for whose
sustenance the command of His Highness allotted the daily allow-
ance of 6 pounds of meat. It instantly occurred to the keeper that

EGYPT—-NEWBERRY 459

no one would be a bit the wiser if he were to feed his dumb ward with
4 pounds and dispose of the remaining two for his own benefit.
This he did, until the lion gradually lost his sleekness and vigor,
so as to attract the attention of his royal master. ‘There must be
something wrong,’ said he; ‘I shall appoint a superior officer to make
sure that the former faithfully does his duty.’ No sooner was the
plan adopted than the first goes to his new overseer, and convincing
him very readily that if the proceeds of 2 pounds be conveyed
to their pockets, the meat would be far better employed than in feed-
ing the lion, they agreed to keep their own counsel and share the
profit between them. But the thirst of the newcomer soon becomes
pleasantly excited by the sweets of peculation. He talks the matter
over with his subordinate, and they have no difficulty in discovering
that the lion might very well be reduced to 3 pounds a day. Droop-
ing and emaciated, the poor beast pines in his cage, and the sultan
is more perplexed than before. ‘A third official shall be ordered,’
he declares, ‘to inspect the other two’; and so it was. But they only
wait for his first visit to demonstrate to him the folly of throwing '
away the whole 6 pounds of meat upon the lion, when with so little
trouble they could retain 3, 1 apiece, for themselves. In turn his
appetite is quickened and he sees no reason why 4 pounds should not
be abstracted from his ward’s allowance. The brute, he states to
his colleagues, can do very well on 2, and if not, he can speak to
nobody in complaint, so why need they lose the gain? And thus the
lion, reduced to starvation point, languishes on, robbed and preyed
upon by the overseers set to care for him, whose multiplication has
but added to his miseries.” .
NORTH AMERICAN INDIAN DWELLINGS?

By T. T. WATERMAN

Museo Nacional, Guatemala

[With 11 plates]

The Indians of North America occupied an enormous area, in
which they encountered almost every known variety of climate and
scenery. In the various regions accordingly there were evolved
different ways of living and, especially, different forms of dwellings.
The forms of Indian habitations were affected by climate and were
modified according to materials available and house types of dif-
ferent regions accordingly offer marked contrasts. Some were
simple; so simple that nothing could be more startlingly primitive
(see the Paiute village shown below, pl. 11, fig. 2). Some were very
complex, and hundreds of feet in length. Some were made of tre-
mendous beams in a cyclopean style of carpentry, while in at least
one area stone masonry was developed, and the ruins of the ancient
stone structures are imposing even to-day (see, for example, Pueblo
Bonito, pl. 7). Some Indian dwellings are picturesque, some are
odd, and all are interesting. The way in which geographic forces
operated in shaping or modifying the habitations of the Indian
tribes is an interesting matter for investigation. The subject may
well be introduced by glancing at two habitation types, both im-
portant and characteristic but very different, the wigwam and the
tipi.

THE WIGWAM

The word “ wigwam,” in the language of the Algonkian-speaking
peoples of the Atlantic side of the continent, means simply a dwell-
ing. The term was applied by Europeans to the types of structures
they encountered among the tribes of the middle Atlantic states.
These habitations were essentially permanent structures and were
grouped into regular towns, with squares and public buildings, which
were fortified, and in many cases defended with earthworks. Movy-

ary, 1924.

able tents were not in use in this region; and the wigwam is not by
any means a tent. It was not essentially a conical lodge, like those
used farther west, but it had in most cases an arched-over roof or
was hemispherical. The simpler forms were shaped like half an
orange, but the vast majority were elongate. The Sac and Fox
Indians, to mention no others, live in this type of dwelling even
to-day. The wigwam in many cases had room enough to accommo-
date a large number of families and would contain, in addition to
benches and sleeping platforms, space for a year’s supply of food.

The eastern Indians who used this form of dwelling were by no
means nomadic savages as often pictured, living by plunder and
the chase. They were peaceable farmers, when circumstances
allowed them to be, living on products quite familiar on our own
tables, corn bread, squashes, plums, wild grapes, berries, maple
sugar, and meat when obtainable. The settler on the Atlantic sea-
board got his food plants, his maple sugar, and his custom of hold-
ing “ husking bees,” directly from the Indian.

This settled, agricultural mode of life together with the wigwam
was distributed over a large part of eastern North America. Briefly,
it went wherever the rainfall and the temperature permitted cul-
tivation of maize. This plant grows naturally only where the hot
growing season is accompanied by rains. Everyone who has crossed
the continent has been struck by the change in the face of nature
in the region of the one hundredth meridian, the longitude of central
Kansas. Westward lis the region of dry as contrasted with rainy
summers. Corn can be grown in the drier west only with artificial
irrigation. Wigwams and the easy cultivation of maize go together
and are characteristic of eastern North America.

The aborigines in this eastern area being sedentary in the same
sense as the present population is, it follows that their houses would
be permanent, not movable. The house structure consisted of a
framework of poles, planted solidly in the ground and bent over
to form arches, covered in with some light material. The con-
struction was practically determined in advance by the nature of the
forest, for the trees consisted in large part of hard woods, which could
not readily be worked up by primitive implements. The material
used to cover the house was of considerable variety. In the Atlantic
region the most popular covering was bark, which was readily
available, both in large quantities and in large pieces, from a variety
of trees, among them birch, elm, hickory, and ash. In areas where
large sheets of bark could not readily be obtained, other materials
were substituted. Thus, beyond the westward margin of the forested
area, on the plains of Arkansas, houses of a similar framework of
poles were thatched over with grass, as among the Wichita (see pl.

SL ee ais

Se ae ee
INDIAN DWELLINGS—WATERMAN 463

4, fig. 1). Among the Ojibwa and Menominee, in the lake region
of Minnesota, matting made of rushes was employed as covering
material, being more readily available there than bark. It is note-
worthy in a general way that as we go farther north Indian houses
become simpler and simpler, until in the far north, among the Cree
or the Salteaux, the structure is » simple framework of light poles
in the shape of a flat cone, covered over in some fashion with sheets
of bark matting, or what not.

The original population in this eastern area was dense as com-
pared with that farther west, because of the greater productivity
based in turn on the occurrence of summer rains. There were people
enough, for instance, to build numerous and quite substantial earth-
works. These included burial mounds, ceremonial mounds, and
fortifications. The mounds were so widely scattered and some at
least of the fortifications so tremendous and impressive, that we
have come to refer to these peoples as “mound builders.” The idea
that the mound builders were different in any respect from other
Indians is quite without foundation. Some of the mounds were
built, in fact, after the coming of the whites, as is proved by the
presence in them of European objects—medals, scissors, porcelain,
pewter, metal buttons, and iron knives. Yet all the Indians living
in the Ohio Valley at the moment when the settlers came into that
region were not numerous enough to man the ramparts of the old
Indian earthwork known as “Fort Ancient.” This decline may be
attributed to a sudden movement of the erstwhile stationary popu-
lation from the area, owing probably to the introduction into Amer-
ica of the horse. The Indians were originally without horses and,
in North America and Mexico, without burden animals of any
description except the dog. In fact, American Indian society, speak-
ing generally, developed a civilization without draft animals or
vehicles. The introduction of the horse by the Spaniards led to
a great economic transformation, a general drift of the population
to the Plains, where pursuit of the buffalo was suddenly made very
easy and sensationally successful. Here a peculiar way of living
developed, apparently after the Spanish conquest of Mexico but
long before the inroad of English-speaking people from the Atlantic
side. Let us turn to the habitations of the “horseback” Indians
of the Plains.

DWELLING OF THE PLAINS INDIANS: THE TIPI

The history of the Plains region of North America does not go
back very far. When our historical knowledge begins, the tribes
were already in possession of horses, and a novel mode of existence
had already developed. What conditions had been before that time
464 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

we can only surmise from a few survivals and from archeological
evidence obtained in the old sites. Some very quaint and curious in-
formation has recently been brought to light in the latter way.
What we consider the typical mode of existence of the Plains Indians
is therefore only the latest phase of their mode of life and a very
novel and highly modified phase at that. Moreover, as we have al-
ready remarked, this highly modified mode of existence has com-
monly come to be considered as the mode of life typical not only of
the Plains Indians but of all Indians. The appearance, dwellings,
and even costume of the modern Indian of the Plains is what comes
to mind when anyone says “Indian.”

Physically the Plains Indians were, and are, a very fine people,
possessing the gift of wearing costume strikingly. This trait is
shared by men and women. The war bonnet of eagle feathers, worn
by the men and never by women (the Indian woman on the old-
style United States copper penny to the contrary notwithstanding),
is the most picturesque headgear worn by any tribe of people any-
where. When the Treasury Department in improving the style of
art exhibited on our coinage wished to select a fine-looking Indian as
model for the head on the five-cent piece, they turned to a member of
one of these Plains tribes.

The dwelling of these Indians was the tipi, or teepee. That this
structure should ever be confused with the wigwam is surprising,
for the two are very unlike. The tipi is a movable tent, covered with
skins, conical in form, with the poles of the framework jutting out
of the top. It forms a very tidy, serviceable, and picturesque habi-
tation and, furthermore, one that is quite distinctive. Tribes like
the Yakuts of Siberia have tents that are hemispherical, not conical,
and covered with felt, not skin. Tents of the Lapps and Samoyeds
likewise differ from the tipis for the tipi cover is cut, or “tailored,”
in a pattern that is perfectly distinctive. I do not know of any
habitation in any part of the world that is really comparable to the
tipi.

The tipi, exclusive of the furnishings within it, consisted of two
parts, a set of poles for the framework and a cover of dressed buffalo
hides, the latter carefully tailored and stitched together. This
was stretched over the poles and pegged down to the ground when
the structure was set up. The poles, preferably of the so-called
lodgepole pine, were long, slender, and elegant—long enough to pro-
ject eight or ten feet above the top of the tent.

In setting up the tipi two poles were put together in the form of a
V and lashed at their intersection with the end of a rope, the rest of
which was left dangling. A third pole was then fastened to the
apex of the V, and the three were raised into the air to form a tripod.

oa ag i SO
INDIAN DWELLINGS—WATERMAN 465

This was the foundation of the tent. Additional poles were care-
fully laid in place, the woman—for this was women’s work—tossing
a turn or hitch of the rope over each new pole and binding the
whole firmly together. Certain tribes, like the Blackfeet, used four
poles, not three, for the foundation of the tipi. In any case, the
finished framework was a smooth conical structure of bare poles.
The cover was next hoisted into place and stretched around the
framework, being pegged down to the ground all around. Where
the two edges of the cover met in front, a set of long slender wooden
skewers were used to fasten them together. The cover was so shaped
that at the top of the tent there was an opening left for the escape
of the smoke, and flanking the smoke hole were two flaps known as
“ears.” Into a pocket at the tip of each ear was inserted a long
slender pole, and these poles leaned against the tent, the lower ends
extending back of the structure and resting upon the ground. With
the help of these two poles the “ears” were moved this way or that,
according to the direction of the wind. A tipi without “ears” is an
impossible dwelling, for it will not draw properly and will certainly
be filled with smoke a large part of the time. The experienced house-
wife will, if the tipi gets smoky on a gusty day, slip outside, and,
with the skill of long practice, shift the direction of the ears a little.
When a family shifts its quarters, the tipi is quicky struck, the
cover rolled up, and two of the longest poles crossed like a V over the
back of a pony, the ends trailing on the ground and constituting a
travois. The family property, the cover, and the extra poles are
loaded on the travois and dragged away. Sometimes the tents of a
whole village would be struck at the same instant, and in a few
minutes each family would be loaded up, and the procession ready to
start.

Not infrequently the earth was excavated a little in the center of
the tipi and piled around the edge. Indians lived in such structures
during the coldest weather, even in Dakota. Curiously enough, tipis
are described as being, on the whole, warm and comfortable. The
Indians have a special knack for picking out suitable sites. There
is many a spot in corners of the rolling plains country where, in the
lee of a hill or tucked away under cover of the cottonwoods which
border a creek, there is shelter from the full rigors of winter. In
hard weather the great Indian encampments broke up, the families
moving hither or thither, wherever they could find a spot sheltered
from the wind.

The distribution of this type of dwelling within the historical
period was dependent upon the distribution of the buffalo. A whole
tribe would sometimes hang on the flanks of a buffalo herd, moving
as the herd moved. The horse had the effect of making the Plains
466 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Indians migratory and the consequent effect of enormously increas-
ing the usefulness of the tipi. In more ancient times the Plains
Indians undoubtedly ate buffalo meat, when they could get it, and
undoubtedly had tipis. But the migratory way of living exclusively
in tipis had not developed. We can glean some knowledge of the
houses of that ancient period by excavation of old sites and through
the fact that some tribes retained the older form of structure until
recently. The characteristic habitation prior to the tipi seems to
have been a lodge, excavated in the ground, roofed with poles, and
heaped over with earth, forming a sort of mound with the dwelling
partly subterranean. This type of dwelling seems to have been dis-
tributed over a large part or all of western North America. It is,
therefore, the next type of habitation to be examined.

THE UNDERGROUND HOUSE OF WESTERN NORTH AMERICA

West of the 100th meridian, which marks the line between moist
and arid regions, the habitations seem to be designed to give shelter
from winds rather than from rain. There is along the Pacific coast,
to be sure, from northern California to southern Alaska, a narrow
strip with a reputation for heavy precipitation. Although in parts
of the strip, for example in southern Alaska, the precipitation is
actually enormous, in a great part of it the rainfall is not really
excessive. Portland, Oreg., for example, has about the same annual
rainfall as Washington, D. C. The strip offers a violent contrast,
however, with the exceedingly arid lands to the eastward. Over
the whole western side of the continent, wet and dry, we find habi-
tations which may be classed under the general term “ pit dwellings,”
for they all contain a central excavation. In the three geographic
regions into which this western area may be divided, Plains, Plateau.
and Pacific Slope, the size, shape, and materials of the house are
greatly modified by local conditions.

The original type has been best preserved apparently on the
Plateau. The tribes here are very conservative, and their culture
is backward in other matters than houses. We may begin, therefore,
by looking at the underground house of the Plateau with the pre-
sumption that it represents an archaic type. It has spread from the
Plateau proper down into certain areas in the central part of Cali-
fornia, along with other elements of Plateau culture.

The earliest description of such houses was penned by Sir Francis
Drake, who landed on the coast of California north of where San
Francisco now stands, in 1579. This place, now called Drake’s Bay,
he named New Albion. He describes the houses of the natives at
this point as follows: “Their houses are digged around about with
earth, and have from the uttermost brimmes of the circle clifts of
INDIAN DWELLINGS—WATERMAN 467

wood set upon them, joyning close together at the toppe like a spire
steeple. * * * Their bed is the ground * * * and lying
about the house, they have the fire in the middest.” *

The method of building these houses, as described by modern ob-
servers, may be outlined as follows. The earth is dug up and re-
moved from a circular depression until a deep pit is formed. The
sides of this pit are lined with timbers or slabs. Posts or supports
are set up in the center, and beams extend from these center supports

to the side walls, forming the framework of the roof. This roof is
later covered in with poles, or split logs, thatched with grass, and
heaped over with earth. The entrance to the dwelling is through a
hole at the top, which serves also as a chimney for the escape of
smoke. Descent is effected by a ladder consisting of a half log, split

lengthwise and having notches cut in it for placing the toes. Some-
times these houses are very large, giving accommodation to a number
of families. The whole structure is substantial and solid.

The detailed construction of this house differs from tribe to tribe.
It may be said, however, that this type of dwelling, including the
entrance through the smoke hole, is found over a very large area in
the interior of British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, and Calli-
fornia—an area characterized by two things, aridity and the rela-
tively low or simple culture of the tribes. The most characteristic
forms are found perhaps among the Shushwap and Lillooet. The
distribution of tribes which have, or have recently had, such houses
is shown on Figure 1.

MODIFIED FORMS OF THE PIT DWELLING: THE EARTH LODGE OF
THE PLAINS

In near-by areas, where different conditions were encountered, the
lodge became somewhat modified in form. For example, among
most tribes on the Plains the pit became so shallow that the struc-
tures can hardly be described as pit dwellings. The general form
was similar, but the space where the family lived was scarcely below
the level of the ground, the excavation going down in some cases
only one foot. In many localities, however, as in the houses reported
from the Oto, Osage, Omaha, and Ponka, the pit was dug four or
five feet deep. In some cases, as among the Pawnee and Hidatsa, the
houses were entered through the smoke hole. With the Hidatsa this
happened only on “rare or special” (ceremonial?) occasions. ‘There
can be little doubt but that these earth lodges, widely distributed
among the Plains tribes, were the same thing as the pit dwellings
of the Plateau. The structures are always covered over with earth,
so much so that they look almost like natural mounds, whence the
common term “earth lodge.” The sloping roofs of these dwellings,
covered with turf, offered an ideal vantage point for observation.
On the inside the lodges were roomy and quite comfortable and re-
ported to be warm even in the most severe weather. The family life
grouped itself around the fireplace in the center. After the introduc-
tion of horses, these animals were often stabled in one corner of the
dwelling; this was the case, however, only with highly valued ani-
mals. The best and most commodious dwellings of this type were
found, perhaps, among the Mandans who at one time had very large
villages on the upper Missouri. The Arikara and Pawnee also fur-
nish good examples. (See pl. 5, fig. 1.)

It is interesting to note that some ancient houses in this region
are described as entirely underground, being entered from above by
means of a ladder. ‘Thus, as we go back in the history of the region,
the resemblance of the dwellings described to the characteristic pit

INDIAN DWELLINGS—WATERMAN 469

dwelling of the Plateau becomes more marked. Such old structures
have recently been reported from eastern Nebraska, where they were
excavated by Sterns,’ and we have historical evidence that they for-
merly existed, for they were reported by an observer among the
Pawnee in 1825, who saw them actually occupied.*

UNDERGROUND STRUCTURES IN THE SOUTHWEST

In the southwestern United States we enter an area quite different
geographically from the one we have been discussing. It has, of
course, an even higher degree of aridity, while the surface is exces-
sively broken up. Human life would seem to be confronted by much
more serious difficulties than elsewhere. Yet certain tribes here
reached a much higher level of culture than the other tribes of North
America. The native habitations here at the present time have little
about them to suggest pit dwellings. On the contrary, they are quite
lofty and pretentious structures, sometimes four or five stories high.
Tt is certain, however, that there were formerly pit dwellings in this
area; and it is possible to trace the evolution of the modern pueblos
from underground structures.

Several pieces of incontestable evidence point in this direction.
In the first place, in the midst of the modern composite structures,
which have square rooms and several stories, there are found cer-
tain ceremonial chambers, circular and subterranean, entered by a
ladder through the roof. ‘These are known by the native term kiva
or the Spanish term estufa. The reason for these underground
chambers has always been a problem, though Cushing long ago
suggested that the people may formerly have lived in underground
houses but under later conditions preserved these chambers for
religious ceremonies.*

This idea seems the more plausible when we consider the whole
history of architecture in the region. It is a somewhat complicated
matter, but certain stages may nevertheless be recognized. Begin-
ning with the modern villages and going back, we can recognize an
architectural tendency toward greater compactness in the more
ancient structures. At the time of the coming of the Spaniards
the villages occupied better defensive positions than they do at
present. When afraid of enemy attack the people moved their
villages to the tops of the mesas, or flat-topped mountains. Some
of these early structures which chanced not to occupy good de-

fensive sites were very carefully planned for military strength.
The finest example of this is the pre-Columbian structure known as
Pueblo Bonito, an ancient site at the foot of a cliff in Chaco Canyon.
This site has been intermittently under process of excavation for
thirty years.5 No modern village is so compact and well planned as
this ruin. At a still earlier stage the village Indians often moved
their towns bodily into a cave in the cliffs. It is unquestionably true
that cliff dwellings represent a bygone stage in the history of these
Southwestern or “ Pueblo” tribes. The cliff ruins, which have been
well known for fifty years and often illustrated, contain the same
square rooms and the same circular, subterranean ceremonial rooms,
and, it might be added, the same general types of pottery, basketry,
stone implements, and ceremonial objects as the modern pueblos.

Recent excavators have brought to light a still earlier stage of
culture preceding the cliff dwellers—that of the so-called “basket
makers.” Apparently before the southwestern tribes built the great
composite clusters of square or rectangular structures which we call
pueblos or cliff dwellings, they had small scattered structures, each
family in a separate house. The houses, only scanty ruins of which
have so far been brought to light, were apparently circular, sub-
terranean, and entered through the roof. These round houses repre-
sent the very beginning of masonry in this region, and the people
were basket makers rather than potters.

The process by which isolated, circular, underground houses be-
came square or rectangular chambers in aboveground structures is
a little puzzling. According to Cushing it was not a replacement
of one type of dwelling by a different type but a gradual modifica-
tion. As the people became more successful farmers, they moved,
Cushing thinks, into the cliffs for security for themselves and for
the little stores of corn about which they seem to have been even
more concerned. The structures came to be built above ground
because they could not be excavated in the rock of the cave floors.
They became rectangular as the mere result of being crowded to-
gether in the limited confines of a cavern. For the same reason
they came to be piled one upon another. Meanwhile the ceremonial
chambers were made underground at any hazard, either by digging
in or by building around and heaping over. Some kivas both

ancient and modern are themselves rectangular, but the others seem
to be much more characteristic.? Apparently we have in the exceed-
ingly picturesque and interesting structures of the Southwestern
Indians a progressive transformation of a very ancient, simple, and
wide-spread type of dwelling which we have already traced in other
areas.

PLANK HOUSES OF THE TRIBES OF THE PACIFIC SLOPE

On the western edge of the continent along the Pacific Ocean,
in the narrow rainy belt already mentioned, the Indians make houses
that are outwardly as different from any of those we have been dis-
cussing as could well be imagined. ‘The forest trees’ grow to a
tremendous size, from 8 to 12 feet in diameter. The wood
is soft, and the logs split easily. The natives work the lumber up
in various forms with the help of such primitive tools as stone adzes,
mauls, and wedges of yew or antler, and the houses in this entire
region are made of plank.

The ordinary notion of Indian dwellings has to be quickly modi-
fied when we discuss the plank houses. In northern California,
houses are intricate and rather ingenious structures put together
with a considerable knowledge of carpentry, without nails of course.
In size they are rather small, the largest measuring 18 by 30 feet.
The houses of the Columbia River region are somewhat larger,
measuring 25 by 75 feet. Farther north again in the region of
Puget Sound their size becomes surprising. H. A. Goldsborough,
who went inside a house on the present Suquamish Reservation in
1855 and measured all the principal beams, gives its length as 520
feet.2 A reputable author, Simon Fraser, reports a house standing
on the bank of the river now bearing his name, that was 646 feet
long and 60 feet wide, saying particularly that it was all under one
roof.? At the mouth of this river he saw a “ fort” (whatever it
may have been) 1,500 feet long and 90 feet wide. Hill-Tout, whose
statements are to be relied upon, says he has seen a house more than
1,000 feet in length.° I have myself seen houses with roof beams
more than 4 feet in diameter; and, in other houses, wall planks more
than 5 feet wide. The ruins of these Indian plank houses are dis-
tributed from Humboldt Bay in northern California to southeastern

Alaska. The most northerly examples I have been able to find in
the literature are structures observed by Portlock in Prince Wilham
Sound, Alaska, in the year 1789. ‘The main facts about these houses
can be summed up by saying that they are always rectangular; are
always made of split planks; and always contain in the center a
pit or excavation in which the family lived.

When I first looked at the detailed construction of the plank
houses in the various parts of this region I received an impression
of great confusion. It seemed as if every tribe had a different type
of dwelling, and some of them two or three. Boas long ago pointed
out that the Haida and Tlingit have one type of house, with three
roof beams*on each side of the central line, while the Tsimshian and
Kwakiutl have another type, with two such beams. To differences
in size I have already made reference. The shape of the roof also
differs markedly.

When all the facts were plotted on a map, however, a certain
amount of system appeared amid this medley. For example, over a
tremendous extent of the coast the houses are all of a gabled form,
except in a small area about Puget Sound and the mouth of Fraser
River where they have a flat or “shed” roof, with a single pitch
in place of the gable. In the case of the gabled houses the end
of the house is toward the beach; in the case of the flat-roofed house
one long side of the structure parallels the beach. In the north
and the south there is characteristically one entrance. In the central
area there is often a series of openings along the front side with the
addition of at least one opening in the rear and still other openings in
the ends. The houses of the central area are also of simpler construc-
tion than the others. In connection, too, with all gabled houses there
is a curious way of giving every hevtise a name. This j is not true of
the flat-roofed houses. Among the Yurok the names of houses
are mostly commonplace. They include such expressions as “ at
the end of the row,” “near the creek,” “in the middle,” “ above the
others,” “in rear of the village,” “set away from the river,” “facing
the ocean,” and other simple descriptive names. I have given else-
where a list of these Yurok house names.42 Some of them are a lit-
tle more ambitious. We find occasionally such names as “big house,”
“biggest house,” “house of feather-plume trees,” “where they dance,”
“where there is sound of dancing.” Among the Yurok the thing has
taken such a peculiar turn that personal names are supplauted by de-
scriptive expressions based on the names of houses. I have not heard ~
of such a custom in any other part of the world. On the northern

INDIAN DWELLINGS—WATERMAN 473

Pacific coast, the names of houses are wonderfully high sounding.
Often they refer to the totem crests of the owners. Some houses
that I have been in myself are “Eagle leg house,” “Black-bear
house,” “Wolf house,” and “Killer-whale house.” Such names as
“Sun house,” “Daylight house,” “Darkness house,” “Moonlight
house,” “Mountain house,” or “Thunder house” indicate the owner’s
high rank. The names just given are Tlingit from southeastern
Alaska. Swanton reports a Haida who had a house so grand that he
called it by a name signifying that clouds moving across the sky
knocked against it.

The fact that at the northern and southern limits of the region
the houses have names certainly suggests a former connection. It is
my opinion that the gabled plank houses represent a diffusion up and
down the coast. As we go toward the center the size increases; at
the ends of the region are similarities of form, though the use of
totem poles in the north gives a different atmosphere externally. In
the case of all gabled houses the gable end is toward the beach. It
is a fair presumption that the flat-roofed houses of the Fraser River
region represent a later form, possibly brought in with some less
highly cultured Salish tribes which have overrun this region. The
gabled form would appear to be the older, and its distribution was
probably continuous along the coast at some former period. This
appears rather clearly from the map (fig. 1).

The dwelling house in northern California, made of planks split
from the redwood tree, was quite a tidy structure. Inside the house
a pit was dug, four or five feet deep, in which the inmates lived.
Around on a sort of earthen shelf, between the edge of the pit and
the walls, was a space for storing things—baskets full of acorns,
piles of dried fish and eels, furs, pelts, bows, a thousand varieties of
miscellaneous property. A person descended to the bottom of the
pit by means of a short ladder of notches in a log. A fire, of course,
burned in the center of the pit; and on racks overhead there was
usually fish or deer meat in process of preservation. The men were
not allowed to sleep within this house. At nightfall all males, young
and old, were obliged to go to certain special structures, known as
sweat houses. These were underground chambers carefully closed
up and almost air-tight. The only time that families were together
was during a season in the spring and summer when the Indians
scattered, camping along the river and fishing for salmon.

The houses in Alaska were from 40 to 70 feet broad and sometimes
80 or 100 feet long, and I have seen a house pit more than 8 feet
deep. Although they did not rival in size the prodigious habita-
tions around Puget Sound, the Alaskan houses were much more
elaborate, as might be expected from the fact that these Indians
474 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

had a more advanced culture. They are made even more interesting
by the presence of numerous totemic carvings. The most conspicu-
ous of these are the gigantic columns known as totem poles. To-
temic symbols are carved not only on the totem pole but on the
house, inside and out, and on canoes, boxes, dishes, spoons, and a
great variety of objects.

That all the rectangular plank houses have pits is a curious thing
indeed. It is difficult to see in what way they are advantageous.
Furthermore, the rectangular plank structures containing pits are
distributed along the margin of an area where genuine pit dwell-
ings exist, i. e., in which the pits are a vital part of the house con-
struction. The simplest explanation would seem to be that the rec-
tangular plank houses represent the transformation of the old con-
ical earth-covered pit dwellings made of poles, in an area where the
growth of giant spruces and cedars made the production of wide
boards or planks possible and fairly easy. Where the house came
to be made of planks the form almost inevitably became rectangular.
On the plateau suitable timber for plank houses does not exist. The
coast people have never been able, however, to get away from the
idea of the central pit.

ESKIMO HOUSES

The Eskimo have two forms of winter habitation, the snow house,
built when they are encamped on sea ice, and a form of under-
ground house. The construction of the latter differs widely in the
eastern and western parts of the Eskimo area, for in the east the
Eskimo is almost entirely without wood. In Greenland, in Labra-
dor, on the shores of Hudson Bay, and westward beyond Boothia
Felix the house is made of crude masonry. A pit is dug, and the
walls are carried upward with course after course of stone. When
flat slabs are obtainable the successive courses project inward, from
which it would seem that the Eskimo is trying in a crude way to
fashion his roof into an arch or dome. Material for supporting the
roof is often hard to find; jawbones of whales are commonly used
for the purpose. The house is below the level of the ground; and
in summer, when the snows melt, it fills up with water. Then the
Eskimo moves out and camps in a tent until winter comes again.

In the western part of Arctic America timber is found in great
quantities. Even where trees are scarce large quantities of logs may
be obtained as driftwood along the coast. Here the house has
been in the past as nearly as possible a replica of the earth lodges
of the distant plateau. The modern Eskimo house especially among
the Eskimo of Alaska is, to be sure, very different from the earth
lodges of the plains, or the subterranean lodges of the plateau.

INDIAN DWELLINGS—WATERMAN 475

It is a structure made of plank, but it is entered by a tunnel from
one side, and, as described by Nelson, has the interior arrangement
which is characteristic of the well-known Eskimo snow house,
which is also entered through a tunnel. The modern house, how-
ever, is very different from the ancient houses in this region. The
houses on the Aleutian Islands are at the present time somewhat
Kuropeanized, having hinged doors, glass windows, and other evi-
dences of contact with Yankees and Russians. The house is covered
with earth, however, and so preserves this much of its old char-
acter. I was much interested to discover that the houses which were
standing in this region something over a century ago, when white
explorers first came in, were, as is shown in the drawings repro-
duced herewith (pl. 9), neither more nor less than pit-dwellings,
entered from above through the smoke hole.

The use of underground houses by the Alaskan Eskimo forms a
link between America and Asia. In northeastern Asia uader-
ground habitations are in constant use, for example, among the
Koryak, Chukchi, and Kamchadal. Such pit dwellings have also
been reported from Sakhalin Island, from Japan, and from farther
afield. It would seem possible that all the underground and semi-
underground houses which have been described have been derived
at some ancient time from Asia.

The stone houses of the Hudson Bay and Greenland Eskimo,
which in all cases are built over pits, may have arisen as a modi-
fication of the same form of dwelling, built, however, in a region
where there is no timber at all. The snow house is another matter.
This seems to be an Eskimo invention, pure and simple.

PUZZLING TYPES OF HOUSHS

The Pima of Arizona use a type of dwelling called the kee. It is
circular in form, made of wattel, and plastered with clay. It contains
no pit. Where they got the plan of this house is very much of a
puzzle. The Navajo build a conical type of house which they call the
hogan (pl. 10, fig. 1). The framework consists of three poles,
which strongly indicates relationship with the tipi of the plains.
The center of the house is excavated down into the ground, and
the whole is heaped over with a thick covering of earth; both of
which features suggest the earth lodge. I admit that I do not know
what to make of these structures. The crudest habitation in North
America is undoubtedly the wickiup of the Paiute, a brush shelter,
shown on Plate 11, Figure 2. Finally there is one tribe of North
America, the Seri of Tiburon Island in the Gulf of California,
who do not know how to make houses at all. The best they can
achieve is a wind break. They live, to be sure, in an all-but-rainless
area.

RELATION TO MEXICAN AND CENTRAL AMERICAN ARCHITECTURE

The houses of the Indians of southern Mexico and Central
America, to say nothing of the structures of Bolivia and Peru,
lead us into another horizon altogether. In these regions the In-
dian became a real architect. Some of the most imposing stone
structures ever raised by the hand of man are to be found in these
areas. The pyramids found in Mexico at Papantla, Cholula, and
Teotihuacan, recently excavated by the Mexican Government
through Dr. Manuel Gamio, actually rival the pyramids of Egypt
in size and interest. Great numbers of ruined cities are gradually
being brought to light, some of them in the most romantic sur-
roundings. It is worth remembering that the American Indian in
certain localities rose by his own unaided efforts to the production
of a great architecture, of which the simpler edifices we have been
discussing represent the beginnings.

THE NATURE OF LANGUAGE?

By R. lL. JONES

Research Laboratories of the American Telephone and Telegraph Company,
and the Western Electric Company, Incorporated

Primitive man, when he wished to communicate, probably ex-
pressed himself by grimaces, vocal sounds, and gestures. Although
each of these three agencies is still somewhat employed, the combi-
nation of voice and ear has been subconsciously evolved and has
survived as economical, most flexible in its capacity for variation,
and superior in perceptibility. ‘

According to modern philologists, early utterances were song-
like and poetic accompaniments of excited or pleasurable emotion,
rich in sound and rhythm but without very definite meaning. The
motives for utterance gradually changed, the process of associating
sense with sound began, and speech and song came to be differ-
entiated.

Primitive languages, in general, consisted mostly of long words
with many difficult sounds. Certain exclamatory sounds came
readily to designate personal feelings. Echo words, mimicing na-
ture, came to designate natural sounds or the manner or source of
their production. Names of persons and objects were an early
development. Most words, however, have had a more obscure and
complex history. Evolution has tended to shorten word forms and
to drop sounds hard to pronounce or to hear.

As man’s powers of analysis have developed language has become
more flexible and capable of greater range of expression. The
grammar of language in general has become simpler and more sys-
tematic.

Men in different parts of the earth have evolved differentiated
languages, any one of which is now based hardly at all upon natural
suggestiveness but rather upon traditional understandings gradually
accumulated. Each language has its own system of elementary

487
488 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

speech sounds. Since only a limited range and variety of sounds
can be spoken, it is natural that there should be many similarities
between the speech sounds of different languages. The elementary
sounds of a given tongue are combined into syllables and words, and
these in turn joined together into phrases to convey ideas, all accord-
ing to the mutual conventions of the people who use the language.

The voice alone enabled man to communicate under circumstances
where his gestures could not be seen and at distances beyond where
his facial expression could be made out. In our own times the in-
vention and development of the telephone has marked a new step
in the evolution of human society, extending the vocal range of man
to extraordinary degrees. Voices are hourly carried with instant
speed from one end of the land to the other and it is now possible
for a speaker to address at one time a million persons gathered about
him or scattered at distant points. Speech is the load which the
telephone system transports, and the ear is the consumer of the
product. Alexander Graham Bell, inventor of the telephone, as
student and professor of vocal physiology gained a deep insight
into the mechanism of operation of the voice and ear before his
greatest invention was made. Throughout his life he devoted him-
self to the alleviation of the infirmities of the deaf and the dumb.
Interest in the problems of speech and hearing comes naturally,
therefore, to the telephone organizations which bear his name by
sentiment as well as by the needs of their practice.

This paper refers briefly to the mechanism of speech and hearing
and then describes some of the physical data of oral communication
which have been obtained by investigations carried on during the
past few years. A selected bibliography of published papers is at-
tached. Much of the material brought together and summarized
here has appeared in scattered form in the articles referred to.

The organs of speech are the lungs, which by their bellows-like
action function as a motor element to supply streams of air which
pass in and out through the vocal passages. The vocal cords, the
tongue and lips, and the cavities of the mouth, nose, and throat,
impress on the air flow variations which are heard as sounds. The
vocal cords are a pair of muscular ledges on opposite sides of the
larynx which can be stretched and brought together, forming be-
tween them a slit of adjustable width through which the breath
passes. The opening between the vocal cords is called the glottis.
The flow of the breath is modulated to form the sounds of speech
by the vibration of the vocal cords and by the resonant reenforce-
ment of the vocal cavities.

Speech is composed of letter sounds usually divided into vowels
and consonants, and those ordinarily used in the English language
are tabulated in Figure 1. So far as possible the sounds are ex-

NATURE OF LANGUAGE—JONES 489

pressed by the letters most commonly used to designate them. In
the case of some of the vowels arbitrary markings are employed to
distinguish sounds which are different but which are represented
by the same letter. The examples given in parentheses will help to
interpret the sounds, and it is believed that for most readers the
classification will be apprehended more readily with the symbols
used than with a system employing entirely different symbols for
each sound some of which would necessarily be new and strange.

Readers familiar with phonetics will easily be able to express these
sounds in the international phonetic alphabet or in other systems of
phonetic symbols.

The classified letter sounds are thirty-six in number. The vowels
and consonants may be classified phonetically into (a) pure vowels,
(6) transitional vowels, (¢) semivowels, (d) stop consonants, and
(e) fricative consonants. Referring to Figure 1, the triangular
diagram at the top of the table represents the first two classes. When
a vowel is spoken the vocal cords vibrate in a complicated manner,
490 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

the characteristics of which are largely determined by the individ-
uality of the speaker. In general, the fundamental or lowest tone
of the vibration is rather low in pitch and somewhat lower for men
than for women. The mouth and throat cavities, modified by the
shape and position of the tongue and lips, act as resonators to re-
enforce and amplify the relative strength of various harmonics. In
this way the shape and position of the mouth and tongue determine
largely the particular vowel spoken. The vowel “u” at the upper
left of the triangle is formed by rounding the lips, drawing back the
tip of the tongue, and raising it at the back in such a way that the
throat is almost closed off and the mouth is formed into a single
large resonant cavity. Overtones of the cord vibration in the vi-
cinity of about 300 cycles are strongly reenforced. As we come down
the left-hand side of the triangle, pronouncing the sounds indicated,
the lip opening widens and the jaw is lowered. The tongue is still
raised at the back, and we have single resonance until the bottom
point of the triangle is reached. In pronouncing the sounds “a”
and “a4” the lips are wide open. With the former the jaw is
dropped, the tongue is only slightly raised at the back, and the most
prominent reenforcement is in the neighborhood of 1,000 cycles.
With the latter the tongue lies flat in the mouth, and the mouth and
throat form connected cavities of nearly equal size. There is double
resonance, the two reenforced tones lying in the region from about
800 to 1,200 cycles. As the vowels on the right hand side of the tri-
angle are pronounced starting upward from “a,” the separation of
the lips becomes smaller, the tongue is raised in the center, and then
further forward. These vowels are all characterized by double reso-
nance. With the sound “é” the lips are drawn to form a wide slit,
the tongue is raised in front until its ridge is closely opposite the
roof of the front of the mouth. The tongue is drawn forward so
that the back of the mouth and the throat form a large resonant
chamber. The small tubular space over the tongue at the front
leads from the larger space to the exit at the lips. The two fre-
quency regions, which are characteristic of the sound “e,” are in the
vicinities of 300 and 2,500 cycles.

The transition vowels or diphthongs are those formed by passing
from one vowel to another. For example the sound “I” is pro-
nounced by forming the mouth as if to say “a” and then rapidly
passing to the sound “é.” Similarly, the sound designated by the
letter “ w” is made by forming the mouth as if to say “ti” and then
passing suddenly to any of the other pure vowels.

Ordinarily when pronouncing a vowel the glottis opens gently at
the beginning of the sound, and the controlled passage of breath
produces the sound. If the vocal cords are separated initially in
such a way that the glottis is open and the sound is begun by a rather

NATURE OF LANGUAGE—JONES 491

forcible expulsion of breath, the letter “h” is prefixed to the vowel.
“LL” and “r” partake of some of the characteristics of vowel sounds
and are usually classified as semivowels.

The stop consonants are those accompanied by the formation of
a stop in some part of the mouth. For example, “b,” “p,” and “m”
are all characterized by a stop formed with the two lips. The con-

sonant sound “p” is simply produced by pressing the lips together
and then speaking a sound which is begun by having the breath part
the lips somewhat forcibly. If the vocal cords are vibrated at the
same time, the sound “b” is produced. This accompanying vibra-
tion of the cords is the characteristic difference between “b” and
“p.” For the sound “m” the stop is the same and the cords vibrate.
492 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

The “m” sound is nasal. The lips are pressed together and the
breath is released through the nose. The stop at the lips is broken
when the sound is terminated or when a succeeding vowel begins.
The method of producing the other stop consonants can readily be
followed from the table.

The fricative consonants are characterized by the rushing sound
of the breath through a characteristic air outlet. We have voiced
and unvoiced consonants among the fricative sounds as well as
among the stop consonants. For example, the sound “f” is pro-
duced by forcing the breath through the air outlet between the
upper teeth and the lower lip. ‘The sound “v” is formed in the
same way except with the accompaniment of vocal cord vibrations.
The method of producing the other fricative consonants is easily
seen by reference to Figure 1.

The speech sounds thus produced in the course of conversation
are radiated from the speaker and transmitted through the air by
means of pressure waves. ‘These air vibrations are very tiny and
exceedingly complicated. In physical analyses of speech it is
usually these pressure waves or their duplicates, converted into elec-
trical vibrations, which are studied. Many of the results here
described were obtained with a certain type of high-quality electrical
reproducing system or circuit as the basis of the experiments. This
system consists of a special form of telephone transmitter, a five-
stage vacuum-tube amplifier for magnifying the electric speech cur-
rents, and, to terminate the circuit, either a group of telephone re-
ceivers of special construction or an experimental type of recording
apparatus. The design and construction of this experimental sys-
tem is such that it is probably the most nearly perfect telephonic
reproducing apparatus so far built. Its quality is indistinguishable
from that of direct air transmission.

In speaking a given letter sound, only the component frequencies
of the particular sound (i. e., a sort of “acoustic line spectrum ”)
are being emitted. By impressing a steady sound on the reproduc-
ing system mentioned above and by rapidly inserting in succession
suitable sharply-resonant filters covering the range of interest,
harmonic analyses of the sustained tone may be made. Figure 2
shows the amplitude-frequency characteristics of some of the Eng-
lish vowels obtained in this way. While these results are typical,
it is to be noted that they represent the vowel sounds as pronounced
by one particular speaker.

But different speech sounds have different components, and more-
over the same sound is frequently pronounced at different pitches,
since conversational speech has more or less melody to it. In the
aggregate speech may be taken to be represented by a band spec-
trum. Figure 3 represents the “acoustic spectrum” of English

NATURE OF LANGUAGE—JONES 493

as obtained from a large number of observations with six different
speakers.

Speech energy extends from a frequency of 60 cycles to above
6,000, with a maximum at about 200 cycles. The vowel sounds
carry most of the energy of speech and their important frequencies
lie below 3,000 cycles. The consonants are the characteristic quips
and quirks with which the syllables begin and end. They are weak
in energy, but very important to good intelligibility. In general,
they are rather high in frequency, some of them involving vibra-
tions going up to a frequency of 6,000 cycles or even higher. The
speech energy output of the normal voice has been found to be at
the rate of about 125 ergs per second.

Fic. 3.—‘‘Acoustic Spectrum” of English

In other terms, simple computations show that if we could have
a million persons talking steadily and convert the energy of the
voice vibrations into heat, they would have to talk for an hour and
a half to produce enough heat to make a cup of tea. This merely
serves to illustrate that in terms of power or energy human speech
is exceedingly weak. Furthermore, most of this energy is carried
by the vowel sounds. On the other hand, the consonants, as will
be shown, are more important to perception and interpretation by
the ear, so that energy per se is not so much the primary require-
ment of speech reproduction, but rather its distribution, and par-
ticularly its distribution among the higher frequencies.

The human hearing mechanism is usually considered to have
three parts. The outer ear includes the lobe, the ear canal, and
the drum. ‘The middle ear is a small hollow space containing the
chain of small bones (malleus, incus, and stapes) which comprise
494 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

the mechanical transmission chain for carrying sound vibrations
from the ear drum to a small annular membrane, the fenestra ovalis
or oval window. ‘The middle ear also contains the muscles which
condition the drum and transmission chain so as to accommodate
the mechanism to hearing under the variety of actual conditions.

The inner ear is a spiral space in the bony shell called the cochlea.
This space is filled with fluid. It is separated into two compartments
by the narrow flexible basilar membrane except at the apex of
the cochlea where a tiny passage, the helicotrema, connects the two
compartments. At the base of the cochlea there is a membraneous
diaphragm, commonly called the round window, located on the other
side of the basilar membrane from the oval window. Within the
spiral casing and terminating on the dividing membrane is the
multitude of terminals which connect with the hearing center of
the brain through the auditory nerve.

Sound vibrations are transmitted by the stapes through the oval
window to the inner ear. At ordinary frequencies vibrations are
transmitted through the fluid to a proper distance along the basilar
membrane (the appropriate position depending upon the frequency)
where they are passed through the membrane and sensed. The
excess of vibratory energy transmitted to the second compartment
is relieved by the flexibility of the round window. The pitch of
a simple tone depends upon the position of maximum response
of the basilar membrane—high tones near the base, low tones near
the apex of the cochlea. The brain is believed to detect the pitch
by its experience in associating tones of different pitches with the
stimulation of different nerve groups. When the pitch of the tone
is very low, the fluid is moved back and forth around the basilar
membrane through the helicotrema. Such impulses follow each
other so slowly that the stimulation of the nerve fibers thereby
produced is not of the type commonly recognized as a sound sensa-
tion. If the pitch of the tone is sufficiently high, the vibratory
impedance of the ear mechanism is such that little or no energy is
communicated to the inner ear, and in that event also the nerve
terminals are unaffected.

The transmission efficiency of the mechanical system linking
the ear drum with the basilar membrane is not equal at all fre-
quencies, and its operation varies also with the intensity or loud-
ness of tone. Changes of intensity are probably detected either
by change in the amount of agitation of the nerve terminals or
by bringing into play wider zones of nerve terminals in the vicinity
of the greatest vibration. ‘The marvelous delicacy of the ear mecha-
nism is called to attention when one considers that, in the average
case, the basilar membrane by means of which all of these various
tones are sensed is only a little over an inch long.

Figure 4 is a plot of auditory sensation for the average human
ear. The lower curve shows the sensitiveness of the ear for sounds
of different pitches and is called the threshold of hearing. The data
were taken by measuring the least sound which could just be heard at
each of a number of frequencies. The sensitivity is measured in
terms of the minimum audible sound pressure while the frequencies
are arranged according to musical intervals (logarithmic scale). The
upper curve shows the extreme values of loudness at which the ear
begins to experience the sensations of feeling the vibrations. This
is the threshold of feeling and may be considered practically as a
maximum audibility curve. Sounds much louder than these are
painful. The two curves enclose the area of audition. The data
have been extrapolated at high and low frequencies to the points of
intersection, the extrapolation being guided to a certain extent by
other available information. At frequencies in the neighborhood
of sixty cycles a high intensity is felt as a sort of flutter. As the
frequency is lowered still further to the point where the hearing
and feeling lines appear to intersect, it is difficult to distinguish be-
tween the two sensations. For frequencies lower than this it is easier
to feel than to hear the air vibration. A similar intersection of the
two curves occurs at a very high frequency. This appears to give
a logical basis for defining the frequency limits of hearing, and as
seen from the plot they are about 20 and 20,000 cycles respectively
for persons of average hearing. At the lower and upper limits of
audition it takes about a hundred million times as much energy to en-
able one to hear as it does in the range of 1,000 to 5,000 cycles where
the ear is most sensitive. At all frequencies the energy required is
small, and in the most favorable region the minimum audible tone
corresponds to a pressure change per square centimeter of about 0.001
of a dyne. This pressure is roughly equivalent to the weight of a
section of a human hair about one-thousandth of an inch long (about
one-third as long as its diameter).

In the portion of the audible region mcst commonly used, it 1s
found that the smallest change in the intensity of a tone which is
just discernible, is equal to about one-tenth of its criginal value. In
other words, in general the law connecting loudness discrimination
with the energy of the tone is a simple logarithmic one. It has been
proposed that change in loudness sensation be measured in units such
that a loudness change is equal to ten times the common logarithm
of the ratio of the energies.

It has been found that the law of pitch sensibility is approximately
logarithmic also. The fractional change in frequency which is just
perceptible is equal to about three-thousandths over the greater part
of the ordinary musical range. The ear perceives octaves as some-
what similar sounds. With these and other facts of hearing in

mind, it has been proposed to measure pitch sensation on a scale
such that the pitch of a tone will be given by one hundred times
the logarithm to the base two of the pitch number or frequency.
These sensation scales of loudness and pitch are given on Figure 4 in
addition to the physical scales of energy and frequency. From the
observations made on intensity and pitch discrimination, it is pos-
sible to show that approximately three hundred thousand different
pure tones are separately distinguishable by the average ear. The
number of complex sounds which can be sensed is even much greater.

The nonlinearity of operation of the ear gives rise to a number
of interesting hearing phenomena. When a simple tone is made
very intense the vibratory efficiency of the middle ear and cochlea
are no longer constant. This gives rise to harmonics which cause
the basilar membrane to vibrate in other zones than that charac-
teristic of the fundamental. If a second intense tone of another
pitch is now impressed, its harmonics are also introduced. Under
some conditions combination tones appear having frequencies which
are the sums or differences of the fundamentals or harmonics.
Some of the combination tones may take the form of beats. Such
harmonics, combination tones, and beats are purely subjective effects
brought in by the departure from linearity of the vibratory mecha-
nism of the internal ear.

The masking of one tone by another is a second effect of interest.
An intense low tone is observed to mask or obscure weaker, high
tones; but high tones, even though intense, have scarcely any mask-
ing effect on lower ones. The explanation offered for this is that the
intense low tone, with its subjective harmonics, sets up vibrations in
the basilar membrane which extend along the membrane to a con-
siderable distance from the base of the cochlea so that vibrations of
higher frequencies which might ctherwise obtain in the adjacent
region, are interfered with. With the opposite state of affairs, the
high-pitched vibrations extend only a short distance from the base,
and more remote portions of the membrane are free to sense tones
of lower pitch.

It will readily be apprehended that with complex tones com-
plicated effects may be obtained. When such a tone is made very
loud, as by amplification, its tone quality may be greatly altered
even though its composition is in no-wise changed. In general its
low frequency components will appear more prominent and its
higher frequencies diminished.

Referring again to Figure 4, the area of sensation most used in
conversation is represented approximately by the shaded area of
the figure. The more intense vowel-like sounds account for the
upper part of the shaded region, while the weaker consonants
account for the most part for the shaded regions of lower intensity
498 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

and higher frequency. It is evident that the processes of evolution —
have worked out in such a way that conversation usually employs
the central part of the area of audition. For clear understanding
the weaker consonant sounds must not fall below the threshold of
hearing nor must the loudest speech sounds rise to such intensity
that the threshold of feeling is reached or nonlinear effects in-
troduced.

Defective hearing is lacking more or less in range of sensation
(that is either frequency or intensity), quality of sensation in
various parts of the sensation area, or in the binaural sense or the
ability to locate the direction from which a sound is received. While
space will not permit a discussion of abnormal hearing, Figure 5
is presented to illustrate the way in which defective range of sensa-
tion may be measured and compared with normal conditions. The
area of audition plot is again reproduced together with hearing-
threshold curves, or audiograms, for a person whose hearing is
subnormal due to catarrhal deafness. The areas between these
threshold-of-hearing curves and the threshold of feeling are the
diminished areas of sensation for the respective ears. The scales
used in plotting the area of audition are such that the area of any
part of the diagram represents approximately the number of simple
tones which can be distinguished in that region. Hence, the pro-
portional part of the whole area in which sensation can still be per-
ceived may be taken as a measure of deafness. It is apparent that
the subject retains about 50 per cent of the normal range in this
case. He hears and interprets conversation with some difficulty. A
suitable deaf set amplifying the speech region to the position indi-
cated by the dashed lines would be of some assistance. Certain of
the weaker consonant sounds would frequently be low enough in
intensity to drop below the range of his hearing even with this aid,
however. If too great amplification were provided, the energy of
some of the vowel sounds would give rise to subjective distortion and
might even produce painful sensations. It is of interest to note
that an unusual degree of nonlinearity is characteristic of some
types of defective hearing. It is evident that in prescribing aids
for the deaf, great care must be exercised in order that there may
be no danger of injury and in order that the best results may be
obtained.

For the study of the interpretation of speech it is necessary to
be able to adjust at will the loudness of the speech sounds and to
introduce determinable amounts of distortion. With acoustic ap-
paratus this is very difficult and consequently for many years
meager results were obtained. The recent development of the
vacuum tube and the electric-wave filter make it possible to produce
the equivalent of the desired changes in the high quality reproducing

system mentioned above. By means of distortionless controls op-
erating on the amplifier the loudness of the reproduced speech is
varied through a very wide range. By inserting electric-wave filters
in the circuit the speech waves can be distorted in known ways. For
example, a low pass filter suppressing frequencies above 1,000 cycles
is connected in circuit and articulation tests made to find the intel-
ligibility carried by frequencies between 0 and 1,000 cycles. For —
experimental purposes it 1s practicable to construct such filters in
which the suppressed frequencies are diminished to one-millionth
or less of the values which would otherwise obtain, while the passed

frequencies are scarcely affected. Similarly high-pass filters can be
made which suppress all frequencies up to a certain marginal region
and pass those above it. Such filter structures are made by the
proper combination of suitable inductance coils and condensers.
Studies of interpretation further require an experimental method
for measuring the ability of the ear to understand’ transmitted
speech sounds with different conditions of loudness and distortion
The method developed consists in pronouncing detached speech
sounds into the transmitting end of the experimental system and in
having observers at the receiving end write the sounds which they
hear. Comparison of the observed sounds with those called shows

NATURE OF LANGUAGE—JONES 501

the number and kind of errors made. The per cent of the total
sounds spoken which are correctly received is called the articulation
of the system. For these tests simple syllables are used constructed
in a systematic manner from the 36 fundamental speech sounds and
arranged in lists of 50 syllables each. A carefully worked out
technique is observed in the testing.

Articulation tests have been made upon the high quality experi-
mental system without distortion, but with controls adjusted to
give various intensities of output from the threshold of audibility
to values considerably above the level of ordinary conversation.
The results obtained are shown in Figure 6. The abscissas of the
curve represent loudness and are expressed as the ratios by which
the speech energy has been decreased from the initial intensity at
exit from the mouth. When the volume is reduced to about one
ten-billionth of the initial speech intensity, the articulation becomes
zero. This point corresponds to the value at which speech becomes
inaudible. At about one-thousandth of the initial speech intensity,
the articulation becomes a maximum. With louder speech than this
perception is less accurate, probably due to overloading of the ear
mechanism and subjective distortion. These results were obtained in
a perfectly quiet room. When the observer is submerged in an
atmosphere of noise the speech must be louder in order to get the
best hearing conditions.

The SSS tiok data have been further analyzed in oaeh a way
as to show the errors made at various intensities for each of the
fundamental sounds. The results for some typical sounds are
shown in Figure 7.

It is observed that in general diphthongs and vowels are more
easily heard than consonants, and that of the latter the stop
consonants are heard with fewer mistakes than are the fricative
ones. If all the sounds are listed in order of average articulation
the top quarter will contain no consonants and the lower half
no vowels. When speech becomes weak, the errors of the con-
sonants increase greatly, their articulation values falling off at
higher intensities than is the case with the vowels.

There are some exceptions to these general statements. At
moderate volume the short vowel “e” is near the bottom of the
list, but at very weak volume 22 sounds are harder to perceive.
“L,” “r,” and “ng” are all more readily heard than “e” at moderate
volume, but when very weak they fall below it. “LL,” which ranks
with the diphthong “i,” as one of the easiest sounds at moderate
volume, is mistaken about two times out of three when very weak.

The diphthongs “i,” “ou,” and the long vowels “6,” “6,” “a,”
all ‘have average articulations better than 95 and even when very

20397—25 33

502 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

weak have values of 84 or better. On the whole the sounds “th,”
“f.” “s.” and “v” are hardest to hear correctly, and they account
for more than half of all the errors of interpretation. In general,
it is observed that the volume at which errors begin to be large
is different for different sounds and is usually higher for the con-
sonants than for the vowels. Within the precision of the data,

the intersections on the axis of abscissas all correspond with the
threshold of hearing.

The effect of frequency distortion has been investigated by insert-
ing several systems of electric-wave filters in the high-quality ex-
perimental circuit. Articulation results with low-pass and high-
pass filters are shown in Figure 8. The ordinates show the per
cent of syllables called which were correctly recorded at the re-

NATURE OF LANGUAGE—JONES 503

ceiving end. The abscissas represent the marginal or cut-off fre-
quency of the filter. Looking at the curve for the low-pass filter,
marked “Articulation L,” the point (1000,40) indicates that an articu-
lation of 40 per cent is obtained when the system transmits only fre-
quencies up to 1,000 cycles. Looking at the curve for the high-pass
filters, marked “ Articulation H,” the point (1000,86) indicates an
articulation of 86 per cent for a system transmitting only fre-
quencies above 1,000 cycles. The dotted curves show the per cent
of the total energy in speech transmitted through filters of the two
types having cut-off frequencies corresponding to the abscissas.
Sixty per cent is lost if all the energy below 500 cycles is eliminated,
but only 2 per cent of the articulation. The suppression of the

frequencies above 1,500 cycles reduces the articulation by 35 per
cent but only 10 per cent of the energy lies in this region. The sup-
pression of all frequencies below 1,000 cycles has no greater effect
than the suppression of the frequencies above 3,000 cycles. This
is quite contrary to the popular notion of the characteristics of
speech. The mean frequency from the standpoint of articulation
is about 1,550 cycles. An articulation of 65 per cent is obtained
when either the frequencies below or those above that point are
used. The speech quality sounds very different in the two cases,
however, in the one being low and dull, and in the other high and
shrill.

It should be borne in mind that naturalness of reproduction, as
well as articulation, is an important element of understandable and
504 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

satisfactory spoken communication. As has been pointed out above,
although the fundamental cord tones and harmonics lying below 500
cycles carry most of the speech energy, they contribute little to the
articulation. It has been observed that naturalness of reproduc-
tion is greatly affected depending upon whether or not these low

frequency tones are preserved. While it might be concluded from
the articulation data then, that frequencies in the lower part of the
speech range are unimportant, a fuller consideration justly at-
tributes an added measure of importance on account of naturalness.
The naturalness of speech quality is a characteristic calling for
considerable further investigation.

NATURE OF LANGUAGE—JONES 505

The curves of Figure 9 show the articulation of some typical
speech sounds when the frequency regions below or above the given
point are suppressed. The ordinate gives the number of times the
sound was correctly observed per 100 times called; the abscissa, the
frequency of cut-off. In each figure the effect of suppressing the
frequencies below the cut-off is shown by the curve at the left, the
effect of suppressing those above it by the one at the right. The
diphthong “i,” the long vowel “é,” and the semi-vowel “1” are each
perceived with an error less than 3 per cent when either half of the
frequency range is used. The intersections of the two curves, the
cut-off frequency where the articulation is the same with either
low-pass or high-pass filters, are at different points in each of the
three cases, however.

In the cases of the short vowels “u,” “o,” and “e,” the frequencies
below 1,000 cycles are important to good articulation, but those
above 2,000 may be suppressed with little effect.

In the cases of the fricatives “s,” “z,” and “th” quite different
effects are observed than with the former two classes. Some of
the peculiar results shown have not yet been explained. Even
if all frequencies up to 5,000 cycles are correctly transmitted, these
sounds are noticeably impaired by the suppression of those above.
The lower frequencies up to 1,500 cycles contribute practically noth-
ing to the articulation of “s” and “z.” It has been observed, in
the case of a system which suppresses all frequencies above 2,500
cycles, that about 82 per cent of the syllables were heard correctly
in an articulation test, and that the errors were made up principally
of failures in the three sounds “s,” “z,” and “th.”

In conclusion then, we have seen that the ordinary ear is an
exquisitely developed organ for sensing minute and rapidly re-
peated variations in air pressure. It can perceive sound waves
ranging in pressure amplitude from less than 0.001 dyne to over 1,000
dynes, and in frequency of vibration from about 20 cycles per sec-
ond to about 20,000—a range of about 10 octaves. Human speech
employs frequencies from a little below 100 cycles per second to
about 6,000 cycles—a range of about 6 octaves. The intensities
and frequencies used most in conversation are those located in the
central part of the area of audition. The energy of speech is
carried largely by frequencies below 1,000, but the characteristics,
which make it intelligible, largely by frequencies above 1,000. Under
quiet conditions good understanding is possible with undistorted
speech having an intensity anywhere from one hundred times
greater to a million times less than that at exit from the mouth.
On the whole, the sounds “th,” “f,” “s,” and “v” are hardest to
hear correctly and they account for over half the mistakes made in
506 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

interpretation. Failure to perceive them correctly is principally
due to their very weak energy although it is also to be noted that
they have important components of very high frequency.

These data are of fundamental importance in the art of elec-
trical communication. But they have also a broader interest and
utility. The information gleaned by physicists in the study of
speech and hearing increases the understanding of phoneticians
and physiologists. It will aid public speakers, linguists, and phy-
sicians, and help to lighten the burdens of the deaf and dumb.
Investigators who engage in the field of human acoustics have
many interesting physical problems to solve. Furthermore, study
of these senses, dealing as it does with two of the primary tools
of the human race, is work of extraordinary appeal holding forth
promise of direct service to mankind.

JOHN MIX STANLEY, 1814-1872

(Photograph made about 1866)

JOHN MIX STANLEY, ARTIST-EXPLORER

By Davin I. BUSHNELL, JR.

[With 7 plates]

During the first half of the last century, when the region west-
ward from the Mississippi was still claimed and occupied by many
tribes, for the most part living in their primitive condition, little in-
fluenced by contact with the whites, many persons, impelled by
different impulses, traversed the country from the river to the moun-
tains. Many, whose purpose was to explore the wilderness, left ac-
counts of their journeys, but countless others failed to leave any
records of their travels and experiences. Some, whose talents en-
abled them to sketch the wild scenes, accompanied the various expedi-
tions; others visited the country for the sole purpose of studying the
native tribes in their natural environments, to obtain portraits of
individuals and to portray the ways of life of the people with whom
they came in contact.

Necessarily the work of the different artists varied greatly in
value and importance, but the sketches and paintings made by the
subject of these notes, J. M. Stanley, were among the most interest-
ing secured during that period. And as mentioned in the preface
of the catalogue of his pictures, which he himself prepared and
which was issued by the Smithsonian Institution in December, 1852,
the collection included “accurate portraits painted from life of
43 different tribes of Indians, obtained at the cost, hazard,
and inconvenience of a 10 years’ tour through the southwestern
prairies, New Mexico, California, and Oregon.” Truly a remark-
able collection, and were it in existence at this time would prove of
inestimable interest and importance to the ethnologist as well as to
the historian. Now before mentioning certain of the pictures in
detail let us trace the movements of the artist during his “10 years’
tour,” during which time he visited the widely separated parts of the
western country. The following account of his travels was pre-
pared by his son, Mr. L. C. Stanley, to whom we are also indebted
for the photograph of his father which is now reproduced as Plate 1.

“ John Mix Stanley was born in Canandaigua, N. Y., 1814, and died
in Detroit, Mich., April 10, 1872. At the age of 14 he became an

507
508 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

erphan and was apprenticed to a wagon maker in Naples, N. Y.,
and spent his boyhood there and in Buffalo.

“Tn 1834 he removed to Detroit, and in 1835 began to paint por-
traits and landscapes. In 1838 and 1839 he lived at Chicago and
Galena. At this time he made pictures among the Indians near Fort
Snelling. During the years 1839-1842 he resided and painted at
New York, Troy, Philadelphia, and Baltimore. In 1842, accom-
panied by Sumner Dickerman, of Troy, he visited the Indian country
in Arkansas and New Mexico and made sketches and pictures of
the Indians and Indian scenes. In June, 1843, accompanied P.
M. Butler, Governor of Arkansas, to a council with the chiefs of
many tribes to arrange a treaty of peace between those tribes and
the State of Texas, then independent, Governor Butler having been
deputed thereto by the Government of the United States, and having
requested the company of Mr. Stanley. The council was attended
by General Taylor, Captain Bliss, and agents of the Senecas and
Delawares. <A flagstaff of considerable height had been raised. Mr.
Stanley was painting a design on a white flag to be flung from this
staff. The design was an Indian’s hand clasping a white man’s
hand. A young Waco chief, ‘Shooting Star,’ observing this work
suggested that the head of a bulldog be painted below the hands
to bite whichever hand might prove treacherous.

“In this year Mr. Stanley visited Chief Lewis Ross, brother of
Chief John Ross, of the Cherokee Nation, at Bayou Menard. He
also visited the Creek Nation on the North Fork of Canadian River
where he witnessed the Busk, or Green Corn dance.

“The opportunities afforded by his constant contact with the In-
dians were improved by almost daily painting and sketching. In
attempting to paint the portrait of the Cherokee chiefs Mr. Stanley
found a difficulty in their caprice and superstition. They insisted
that portraits should first be painted of Jim Shaw, a Delaware,
and of Jess Chisholm, a Cherokee, under whose protection Mr. Stan-
ley had been conducted; if these men should consent to sit and
should receive no harm from the operation, then the Cherokee
chiefs would sit. It was done in this way. They came forward in
the order of their rank and were delighted with the idea of being
painted, considering it a great honor.

“Mr. Stanley spent part of the year 1845 in New Mexico. By the
year 1846 he had painted 83 canvases, and in January of that year
he and Mr. Dickerman exhibited them in Cincinnati and Louisville.

“In May, 1846, Mr. Stanley returned to the west and visited Keo-
kuk at his lodge, and made portraits of the wife of Black Hawk and
of chiefs of the Sauks. In October, 1846, he visited Santa Fe to
paint still more pictures. Here he joined the expedition of Gen. S.
H. Kearney, who led the dangerous march overland to San Diego,

JOHN MIX STANLEY—BUSHNELL 509

Calif. He was placed under the immediate command of Captain
Emory, of the Topographical Corps, United States Army. At the
mouth of the Gila River they had a battle with some California ir-
regulars. This was during the time when General Flores, the
counter revolutionist, held Los Angeles and Commodore Stockton,
in opposition, held San Diego. In this march Mr. Stanley was also
in the actions at San Pasquale, Calif. In 1847 he proceeded north-
ward through California, and by July reached Oregon. He es-
caped, most narrowly, the massacre in which Dr. Marcus Whitman,
Mrs. Whitman, and 11 others were killed by a few Indian mal-
contents of the Cayuse Tribe. He was leaving the mission of
Walker and Eels at Fort Colville, intending to go to Doctor Whit-
man’s mission. He was stopped by the actions of some Indian chil-
dren, who indicated danger by making gestures to turn him about
in the way.

“In Oregon he made sketches of Mount Hood and of the Colum-
bia River, which river he navigated in canoe for nearly a thousand
miles, and later painted two pictures of Mount Hood. He then re-
turned to San Francisco, via Sacramento, and sought to take a cer-
tain ship for return to New York around Cape Horn, but was not
in time for that ship. It was lost at sea; no lives were saved. Re-
turning on another vessel, he landed at Honolulu, where he re-
mained during most of the year 1848. During his stay he painted
the portraits of King Kamehameha III and of his Queen. These
portraits hang in the Government Museum at Honolulu, formerly
the Royal Palace.

“Returning to this country, Mr. Stanley exhibited his collection
of pictures in 1850 at Troy and Albany, and in the following year at
New Haven, Hartford, and Washington, D. C. The collection now
included the portrait of Chief Hendrick of the Stockbridge Tribe.

“Tn 1853 Mr. Stanley was appointed to be the artist of the expe-
dition sent by the Government of the United States to explore a
‘Route for the Pacific Railroad near the forty-seventh and forty-
ninth parallels of latitude from St. Paul to Puget Sound.’ Mr. Stan-
ley joined the expedition at Jefferson Barracks, Mo., where it was or-
ganized, but the actual start was from St. Paul. Isaac I. Stevens,
_ Governor of Washington Territory, was in command of the expe-
dition. In September, 1853, Mr. Stanley was sent on a special mis-
sion to the Piegan and returned with their chiefs, about 30 in number,
to a council with Governor Stevens at Fort Benton.

“The Indians were impressed by Mr. Stanley’s ability to make
pictures of them with his brush. Also the daguerreotype process
which he sometimes used was to them a thing inspired because pro-
duced by the light of the sun.

“Tn 1854 Mr. Stanley returned to Washington, where he remained
till 1863, when he removed to Buffalo, where he spent a year. In
1864 he began the painting ‘ Trial of Red Jacket,’ a picture contain-
ing about 100 figures, and his most important single work.
It is now hung in the building of the Buffalo Historical Society,
Buffalo, N. Y. His paintings remained on exhibition in the Smith-
sonian Institution and only five of the collection escaped destruction
when the building was damaged by fire, January 24, 1865.”

In the catalogue issued in 1852, to which reference has already
been made, 151 pictures by Stanley were described. The last item
in the catalogue was “152, J. M. Stanley, The Artist. Painted by
A. B. Moore, 1851.”

The interesting old photograph reproduced in Plate 2, reveals a
corner of the picture gallery in the Smithsonian Building as it
appeared before the fire. The larger pictures were part of the
Stanley collection, but the smaller works on the left may have been
some of the Indian portraits by King and others. It will be remem-
bered that many important Indian pictures, in addition to those
which formed the Stanley eollection, were destroyed by the fire.

The descriptive list of the Stanley pictures, which appeared in the
catalogue in 1852, was reprinted in the “Guide to the Smithsonian
Institution and National Museum, 1861,” consequently it would ap-
pear that no additions had been made to the collection during the in-
tervening years. However, Mr. L. C. Stanley is of the belief that the
painting hanging near the center of the group, as shown in Plate 2,
was a portrait of Gov. I. I. Stevens. It was not the portrait of his
father, the artist, number 152 in the list.

The collection had evidently been deposited in the Smithsonian
Institution by the artist a short time before he became a member
of the expedition, which started in the spring of 1853. As a mem-
ber of the expedition he made a large number of sketches of the
various points of interest, and as a novel experiment he carried a
daguerreotype apparatus, probably the first taken up the Missouri.
In the report of the expedition is this note: “August 7, 1853. Mr.
Stanley, the artist, was busily occupied during our stay at Fort
Union with his daguerreotype apparatus, and the Indians were
greatly pleased with their daguerreotypes.” (Reports of Explora-
tions and Surveys * * * from the Mississippi River to the
Pacific, Ocean. ;.*;,,.* +.*.4,18538-1855.. Vol. X41. Pt. i 4880p:
87.)

After the collection had been deposited in the Smithsonian and
was open to the public, various attempts were made to have Congress
purchase it for the Nation, but without success. The pictures re-
mained the property of the artist, consequently their destruction
caused him a great personal loss.

JOHN MIX STANLEY—BUSHNELL 511

The exact number of pictures in the Stanley collection at the time
of the fire has not been ascertained. It is quite difficult to believe
no changes or additions had been made between the years 1852 and
1865. However, it is possible the collection was maintained as a
unit, exactly as it was when first placed in the gallery of the Insti-
tution, and if this were true it is evident 146 of Stanley’s paintings
were destroyed.

For certain reasons five of the more important canvases had been
removed from the “Gallery of Art” to another part of the Smith-
sonian Building, and, fortunately, the section of the building in
which they were placed was not seriously damaged by the diasas-
trous fire which resulted in the destruction of the balance of the
collection. These now form part of the permanent collections of the
National Museum.

The five paintings now belonging to the United States National
Museum may be considered excellent examples of the artist’s work.
They are now described in the order in which they were painted. The
quotations are taken from the descriptive catalogue, prepared by
Stanley:

Plate 3. “International Indian Council. This council was con-
vened by John Ross, at Tal-lequah, in the Cherokee Nation, in
the month of June, 1843, and continued in session four weeks. Dele-
gates from seventeen tribes were present, and the whole assemblage
numbered some ten thousand Indians.”

Tahlequah, where the great gathering took place, was the name
applied to the capital of the Cherokee Nation, in the northeastern
part of the Indian Territory, in 1839. It is now part of the State
of Oklahoma. Tahlequah became an important gathering place for
many tribes, and the painting of the assemblage during the early
summer of 1843, is one of the most valuable and important Indian
pictures in existence.

Plate 4. “Ko-rak-koo-kiss. A Towoccono Warrior. This man
distinguished himself among his people by a daring attempt at
stealing horses, in the night, from Fort Milan, on the western fron-
tier of Texas. He succeeded in passing the sentries, and had se-
cured some eight or ten horses to a lariat, and was making his way
to the gates of the fort, when he was discovered and fired upon. The
night being dark, the shots were at random; he was, however,
severely wounded by two balls, received two sabre wounds upon his
arms, and narrowly escaped with his life. He is about twenty-three
years of age, and by this daring feat has won the name and standing
of a warrior among his people.”

This Tawakoni warrior may have been present at the council of
Tahlequah, in 1843; his tribe was one of the seventeen represented
at that great gathering.
512 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

Plate 5. “An Osage Scalp-Dance. * * * On returning from
the scene of strife, they celebrate their victories by a scalp-dance.
* * * This picture represents the scalp-dance of the Osages
around a woman and her child; and a warrior in the act of striking
her with his club, his chief springing forward and arresting the blow
with his spear.”

A picture possessing great artistic merit. The ornaments and
decorations of the Osage are carefully drawn; the many details of
the picture are quite remarkable.

Plate 6. “A Buffalo Hunt. On the Southwestern Prairies.” The
tribe represented in the picture is not mentioned, nor is it now pos-
sible to identify the Indian. The scene was typical of the time and
place.

Plate 7. “ Black Knife. An Apache Chief, reconnoitering the com-
mand of General Kearney on his march from Santa Fe to Cali-
fornia.”

This large canvas, measuring 41 by 50 inches, is shown in the old
photograph reproduced in Plate 2. It hangs on the extreme right,
third row from the bottom, and knowing its size enables us to form
a better idea of the others shown in the same photograph, all of
which were destroyed in the fire of January 24, 1865.

The destruction of the collection of 146 paintings caused an ir-
reparable loss, a loss which will be more fully appreciated in the
future when the events depicted and the individuals shown will be-
long to the vague past.

HERLUF WINGE

HERLUF WINGE (1857-1923) }
By TH. MORTENSEN

[With 1 plate]

Herluf Winge was born March 19, 1857, the son of C. G. Winge,
an official in the Navy Department, and wife, born M¢gnster. From
‘his earliest boyhood he was, together with his brother Oluf, two
years his senior, deeply interested in zoology, especially in mammals
and birds, and, above all, in osteology. He made collections of all
sorts of bones and trained himself in their identification, and in
recognizing and correctly interpreting all sorts of fragments of
bones and teeth, a training which became of the greatest impor-
tance to the work of his manhood. He entered the University of
Copenhagen in 1874 (from the “Borgerdyd” school) and, of
course, at once eagerly devoted himself to a thorough study of
zoology.

In 1881 he took his master’s degree in zoology; from 1883-1885
he was a voluntary aid at the Zoological Museum; in 1885 he was
appointed assistant in Department I of the Museum, and in 1892 he
was nominated vice inspector of this department, a position in which
he remained until his death. He died on November 9, 1923, without
any preceding illness. He had, however, aged considerably during
his later years, especially after the accident he met with in the winter
of 1922, when he fell and broke an arm. But mentally he was in
full vigor to his last day aud intensely occupied with a great work,
in which he intended to sum up the results of ull his studies of mam-
mals, studies that had made up the main part of his life’s work.
It was, perhaps, overexertion with this task which caused his death.

Winge’s life formed itself very regularly, without greater events,
except for the great aflliction he suffered when his brother Oluf died
in 1889. He had always looked up to this brother as his ideal, and,
to the end, he cherished his memory with the greatest piety, declar-
ing himself to be only a faint reflection of him. Winge wasa bachelor
and, at any rate in his later years, perhaps slightly eccentric. Whilst
in his younger years he enjoyed attending, in company with his

Academy of Sciences, Copenhagen, Mar. 14, 1924, and published in its original form in

brother, the scientific meetings of the Natural History Society, re-
peatedly giving lectures there, after the death of his brother he with-
drew, lived by himself, and had intercourse with his colleagues only
during the working hours at the museum, which he kept with minute
punctuality. It was never possible to make him attend any meeting,
still less any social gathering. He could not even think of being
away from his home during the evening. In this peculiarity we
must seek the reason for the fact that Winge, who was, in 1910,
elected member of the Academy of Sciences, never attended a meet-
ing, a circumstance that caused him to be rather little known to all
those who did not get an opportunity of coming into touch with him
through their work. But if anybody called on Winge in his home, in .
his pretty villa on Lemche’s Road, in Hellerup, they might be sure
of a very hearty welcome; and all those who have had an opportunity
of knowing him more intimately—he did not in any way shun peo-
ple—commend him as one of the most high minded and disinterested
of mankind. He was so fortunate as to be financially well situated,
so that the smallness of the salary he received did not inconvenience
him; he could afford to provide himself with an excellent hbrary and
even to pay the expenses of illustrating his papers when the Periodi-
cal (Vid. Medd. Dansk Naturh. Forening, Kgbenhavn) could not
afford it. He was fortunate enough to be able to devote his life to
his science alone—he cared little for anything else. He was
satisfied with his subordinate position, did not aim at power or
honor, and rather preferred being exempt from any official recogni-
tion in the form of titles or rank, only wishing to live as quietly and
unnoticed as possible. But when truth and right were concerned
he did not hold back, and on a certain occasion he did not hesitate
to put his position at stake, in order to prevent something that he
regarded as improper.

Immediately after receiving his master of arts’ degree, Winge
made a trip to Italy and Switzerland, a journey which he ever after-
wards remembered with great delight. But since then he was prob-
ably never outside of the boundaries of Denmark. Besides some
minor journeys in consequence of the investigations of the kitchen
middens from the Stone Age, in which he took part, he traveled, upon
the whole, very little. Only once he went to Ringk¢gbing Fjord, on
account of Rambusch’s investigations there, and joined in excursions
to “ Tipperne” and “ Klaegbanken.” The rest of the time he stayed
at home making small excursions in the environs of Copenhagen,
partly on his bicycle. It sounds rather odd to those who knew
Winge personally to hear that he used to ride a bicycle; and it must
be admitted that he did not look very sportsmanlike in his long,
black frock coat and large, black, broad-brimmed hat—the costume
which he always wore at the museum, as well as on excursions.

HERLUF WINGE—MORTENSEN 515

The trip to Ringk¢gbing Fjord, with Dr. S. Rambusch and Winge,
is one of my dearest memories. It was the first time that I had the
opportunity of becoming intimately acquainted with Winge, and I
was deeply impressed at seeing his excitement and joy over the mar-
velously rich bird life which makes this particular spot one of the
brightest jewels in the natural scenery of our country to the lover of
nature. He was not a closet philosopher as one might be inclined to
believe from a first superficial impression. It was not merely old
bones that he knew and could decipher, perhaps better than any-
body else in the world; living nature as well he knew thoroughly,
and loved it, one might almost say, fanatically * * *. The birds
and the small mammals attracted him especially. At home, at his
villa, he had bought the adjacent site in order to let it remain as
waste land, a sanctuary to birds and small mammals, and here, where
no hand was ever allowed to “put things in order,” but where the
weeds were free to spread, obeying only the laws of nature, he found
great enjoyment in observing the amazingly rich animal life stirring
in this small sanctuary in the middle of the closely-built villa quar-
ter. You will understand from this that Winge must have been an
ardent advocate of all protection of nature. He fought particularly
against the hunters in their fatally misconceived war of extermina-
tion on all birds of prey, as his brother had previously done in his
excellent booklet “ Jaegernes skadelige Dyr” (“'The Hunters’ Nox-
ious Animals”), a new edition of which Winge took charge of and
paid for in 1911.

We have a very beautiful illustration of Winge’s love of nature
in his will, in which he directed that a fairly large part of his
fortune (70,000 kr.) is to be used for purchasing a nature park in
the neighborhood of Copenhagen, where animal life shall be abso-
lutely protected. He has entrusted the University with this matter,
which will, we may be sure, be carried out in strict accordance with
his wishes.

One of the things that made the greatest impression on us who
knew Winge was his phenomenal knowledge of the birds’ voices.
Not merely did he know the song of the various birds, but any sound
which they can produce he knew, and understood what it meant—
their calling for each other, expression of fear, sounds of warning,
etc. Winge knew the birds’ language, but he also knew the art of
making others understand it. One of the first excursions held by
the Natural History Association—in 1903—had the object of study-
ing birds’ voices under the leadership of Winge. Several of us who
joined this excursion remember, I feel sure, with deep joy how he
stood there in the freshly leaved-out beech wood in “ Ermelunden,”
teaching us the curious trills of the green warbler—which reminds
one of a rattling silver coin. He then led us to “Hvidegaard ”
516 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

burial mound, told us about the sorcerer of the Bronze Age, whose
grave had been found there, who had with him in his grave his
leather box with the magic charms, a claw of the goshawk, and
several bits of animal remains and pebbles, doubtless taken from the
stomach of the same bird, which was probably regarded as sacred
by the people of the Bronze Age. He further told about the finds
in a Bronze Age grave (Aalestrup Heath) where there had been dis-
covered, together with the remains of a young, scarcely full-grown
man, remains of birds, from which it was evident that six pairs of
wings of the jackdaw and two pairs of wings of the crow or rook
had been laid on the funeral pile, together with the dead man,
evidently with the idea that these black wings should carry the soul
to the unknown land. Winge had a profoundly poetical mind, and
few are those, I think, who, more than he, have understood and
enjoyed the beauty of nature, be it purely the beauty of the land-
scape in the extensive meadows at Ringkgbing Fjord, or in the
beech wood just out, or in the chorus of birds in springtime.

His first scientific paper Winge published asan undergradute when
he was but 20 years of age. It is a very careful comparative osteo-
logical anatomical description of the crania of the mole and shrew,
which does not, however, show in any marked degree the character-
istics of the future investigator. On the other hand, already in his
next paper “Om graeske Pattedyr” (On Greek Mammals) (“ Vid.
Medd.” 1881) we have Winge complete, with all his excellent qual-
ities, his exactness in every detail, his careful observation of the
habits of the living animals, his remarkable knowledge,
the very carefully considered presentation, the interesting notes,
and not least, his emphatic Lamarckism. * * * Especially in-
teresting is his demonstration here of the fine correspondence between
habits and morphological features in the structure of the teeth, the
cranium, and the whole body of the field voles, characteristics which,
according to Winge, have arisen entirely as a result of their habits.
We have here the train of reasoning that runs like a red thread
through Winge’s whole life work: his pronounced Lamarckism. To
him there was no doubt but that all the morphological and anatomi-
cal characteristics of the animals had arisen as direct effects of their
habits. We get the impression (I never discussed it with him di-
rectly) that he was even of the opinion that the very animals con-
sciously operated to develop themselves, each in its special direction.
A few quotations will show this: “In order to be able to watch and
to get long limbs which might in time carry them away from
their enemies, the ungulates have from the very outset practiced
rising on tiptoe.” “What has happened on the way from reptiles to
true mammals is this, that a series of alterations have arisen in conse-
HERLUF WINGE—MORTENSEN Be Ey

quence of a more active life. Appetite for food has started evolution ;
their own voracity and the fear of the voracity of others have made
lizard-lhke reptiles use all their faculties with special diligence, and
they have worked their way forward to become mammals.” It is
training and use that condition development. The necessary premise
is, of course, the inheritance of acquired characters, and about this
Winge had absolutely no doubt. True enough, it is at present more
common to deny the inheritance of acquired characters, as being at
variance with our experience. The problem can—in my opinion—
by no means be said to be solved as yet. Much may be said, and is
said, for as well as against it. I shall, of course, not here enter more
in detail on this question which is the foundation of all Lamarckism.
But it may probably be admitted that it is not likely that there will
be many who can fully share Winge’s point of view on this matter.

The year after, 1882, Winge published a paper “ Pattedyrenes
Tandskifte, isaer med Hensyn til Taendernes Former” (‘Tooth suc-
cession in mammals particularly with reference to the forms of the
teeth), which may well be designated as one of the best works ever
produced on this important subject. Had it been published in one
of the universally known languages it would at once have procured
for Winge recognition as one of the most prominent mammalogists.
As it was, it took a good deal of time before it was known at all
among the investigators of foreign countries. But Winge insisted
that he would compel the naturalists of foreign countries to learn to
read Danish, with the result that, even at present, after the course
of half a century, this treatise is only partly known—and partly mis-
understood, on account of the language. It is not necessarily given
to every naturalist to be a linguistic genius, and it is not to be ex-
pected that they should sacrifice half their lives in learning all the
possible—or impossible—languages in which scientific papers may
be published. The result is that such works are ignored, to the harm
not only of the author, but often also to that of science. This was
exactly the case here.

The dentition in mammals and its phylogenetic development has
been the subject of detailed studies from many points of view, and
several theories have been advanced concerning this matter. The
theory which has won the most followers was first outlined by two
American paleontologists, Cope and Osborn, and is named after
them. It coincides in the main with Winge’s theory though differ-
ing in important particulars, but is distinguished by a much
more cumbrous terminology. If Winge’s paper had been pub-
lished in one of the universal languages, his theory and his name
would no doubt have won the acknowledgment that fell to the share
518 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

of Cope and Osborn; and many a theory, more ingenious than suc-
cessful, as to the explanation of dentition would have been made
superfluous. * * * I shall try in a few words to give an idea of
what Winge’s theory aims at.! In the reptiles from which mammals
are descended the teeth were not used for chewing, only for catch-
ing and holding or rending the prey that was usually devoured
whole. True mastication of food seems to have originated within
the mammalian group and this involved a further development,
partly of the chewing muscles, partly of the teeth. Of special im-
portance is the appearance in mammals of an entirely new muscle,
the masseter, which through its attachment somewhat in front on
the lower jaw, lends increased strength to the movements of the jaw.
During the chewing and cutting process the lower jaw is moved
not only straight up and down, but also slightly to the sides,
and forward and backward, thus bringing each of its teeth alterna-
tively into contact with the two teeth of the upper jaw between
which it fits when the chewing apparatus is at rest. These contacts
stimulate the teeth to the development of secondary cusps, a process
which chiefly affects the more posterior teeth, that is, the ones
which receive the muscle power most strongly. Whereas in reptiles
the teeth are simply conical, they are in the oldest mammals three-
cuspidate (not counting some aberrant forms). The middle cusp is
the largest and the primordial one, the two others are the new addi-
tions due to contact stimulation. As an inheritance from the rep-
tiles, the lower jaw is slightly narrower than the upper jaw. Hence
the teeth of the lower jaw must slide along the inner side of the
teeth in the upper jaw. The act of chewing will thus have the
greater effect on the outer side of the lower teeth and on the inner
side of the upper teeth. Through the continuation of this influence
the three-cusped primitive mammalian teeth are further stimulated
to the formation of new cusps, as a rule two of them, which, accord-
ingly, appear on the outer side of the lower teeth and on the inner
side of the upper teeth. Whereas the lower teeth, set as they are
in the narrow movable mandible, do not as a rule develop any
further, still another pair of cusps may appear on the inner side of
the upper teeth, which are broadly supported in the solid maxilla.
* * * At the same time the three original, primitive mammalian
cusps may be reduced, being less used, and, at last, they may com-
pletely disappear. The various cusps now being numbered, though
in Winge’s system and not in strict accordance with their phylo-
genetic succession (the primordial cusp bears the number 2), we
have a means through which we can indicate, with full certainty,

21As this paper in the English version is intended for a2 somewhat different class of

readers than that to which the original Danish text was addressed, this paragraph has
been slightly enlarged, with Dr. Mortensen’s consent, by Mr. Gerrit §. Miller, jr.—Epb.
HERLUF WINGE—MORTENSEN 519

how the various cusps in different mammals correspond to one
another, and how the various tooth forms have developed from
one another. In the diagram introduced by Winge we have an
exceedingly simple, but absolutely clear method of indicating the
morphological value of every tooth form.

It may perhaps appear somewhat exaggerated to attach such great
importance to this unraveling of tooth relationship. It is, however,
by no means so. The teeth in mammals reflect in such high degree
the habits and organization of the entire creature that one may, as
it were, from a molar alone draw conclusions as to the whole animal.
The teeth [within certain limits]+ form the main foundation for
recognizing generic interrelations. Moreover, teeth are particularly
fit for being preserved in a fossil condition; of the oldest forms of
mammals, we know scarcely more than the teeth, at most now and
then a fragment of a lower jaw. To have given the correct de-
ciphering of the tooth structure of mammals, is, therefore, a scien-
tific achievement that is in itself sufficient for securing its author
imperishable honor. But this is not Winge’s only achievement.

In 1888 appeared the first volume of “ E. Museo Lundii,” the large
work on Dr. P. V. Lund’s collections of fossil bones from the lime-
stone caves of Brazil, published at the expense of the Carlsberg
Foundation. To this volume Winge contributed a large memoir
“ Jordfundne og nulevende Gnavere” (Rodents, fossil and recent).
This is the first of a long series of memoirs in which are successively
worked out: bats, marsupials, monkeys, carnivores, ungulates and
edentates; the last of them appeared in 1915. While Volume I
contains contributions by Reinhardt, Liitken, Oluf Winge, and
Sgren Hansen, the whole of the rest of the work is exclusively
Herluf Winge’s—truly a monumental accomplishment that will
secure to Winge a place of honor among paleontologists and mam-
malogists, carried out, as it is, with the greatest care and exactness,
and with an immense learning. While the first five of these memoirs
are accompanied by a French résumé, the two last, and largest, are
exclusively in Danish.

This work alone would be designated as a great life work. But
Winge has yielded much more. Let me first mention that from
1891-19102 he took charge of the annual report on the birds at the
Danish lighthouses. Originating in England in 1879, an arrange-
ment was introduced in Denmark in the middle of the eighties,
mainly on the initiative of Oluf Winge and by means of a small
annual grant from the Government, by which all the birds that fall
at the Danish lights are to be forwarded to the Zoological Museum for

1 The words within the brackets were added by Mr. Gerrit 8. Miller, jr.

520 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

scientific identification. This is a far better plan than the English
one, according to which the lightkeepers merely forward a report on
the birds that have been found. Denmark has the honor of being
the only country where these researches are carried on regularly.
They have yielded very important results, especially in the form
of highly interesting information about the traveling of the migra-
tory birds. In this connection I should like to mention that Winge
gave, in the work “ Danmarks Natur” (“ Frem,” 1897-1899), an ex-
ceedingly beautiful and vivid description of the arrival and de-
parture of migratory birds, a description which has, with perfect
justice, been introduced into the Danish reading books of the
schools.

In connection with these bird reports I shall only just mention
his revision of the birds and mammals of Greenland for the “Con-
spectus Faunae Groenlandicae” and his book on Danish mammals
in “Danmarks Fauna.” We may now ‘pass to another main sec-
tion of Winge’s life work: His researches on bones and skeletal
remains from the kitchen middens of the Stone Age, and from the
graves of the Bronze Age, upon the whole all the remains of birds
and mammals from prehistoric times collected by our archeologists
and geologists. These researches were of the greatest importance.
Jt was through Winge’s researches that we received the first decisive
proofs of the fact that the Stone Age comprises two different periods,
the older and the younger, the people of the older Stone Age being
hunters, those of the younger Stone Age resident agriculturists who
kept domestic animals. It is a truly enormous amount of material—
hundreds of thousands of bone fragments—that Winge went over
and identified with quite a phenomenal certainty; and we are in-
voluntarily seized with admiration for the man who was able to
carry through this immensely great and difficult work. Also neigh-
boring countries, both Sweden, Norway, and Finland, applied to
Winge for help in similar work, and he was always ready to give
his assistance. It is thus not only the zoologists, but to an equally
high degree the geologists and archeologists who have reason to re-
member Winge with the deepest gratitude.

After the completion of all these works—“ E Museo Lundii,” the
works on the birds and the researches on the bone remnants from
prehistoric times, it was Winge’s purpose to sum up the results
of his studies of mammals in a great, comprehensive account of all
mammals and their mutual relationships. It was his intention that
this work should be, as it were, his scientific testament. * * * It
became so, alas, in a more direct meaning than he had probably imag-
ined, as he died before it was finished. He just lived to send out
Volume I; Volume IT was in print; and the concluding Volume IIT,
HERLUF WINGE—MORTENSEN 521

fortunately, also was so nearly ready that it can be published quite
unaltered, in full accordance with his plan. Winge himself paid
the expenses of the publication, and he has also seen to it that the
necessary means for meeting the remaining expenses are available.
It is to be regretted that the work is written in Danish (without any
summary in a foreign language), because it will thus be cut off
from gaining the recognition in international science that it ought
to have as the comprehensive presentation of the results that one
of the most eminent of mammalogists had reached through the inde-
fatigable and conscientious work of a long life, and through a
unique mass of learning and an acute valuation of all characters.
In an obituary of Winge in “ Nature” (29.X11.1923) this work is
characterized as “the finest, most comprehensive and most inspiring
technical account of the class mammalia that has ever been written.”

Not being a specialist in Winge’s domain, I have great satisfaction
in being able to lay before you the opinion of one of the most promi-
nent foreign authorities in this field, namely of our member, Prof.
Max Weber, of Holland. He wrote me, immediately after my
informing him of the death of Winge, a letter that I beg to quote
in extenso (in translation) : “ Your letter has filled me with sorrow
through the deeply sad news that Winge has suddenly departed
from life. A few days before receiving your letter I had received
from Winge himself Part I of ‘ Pattedyr-Slaegter.’ I was greatly
delighted thereby, because, although the book is in great part a
reprint of the comprehensive main sections of his extremely valuable
mammalogical studies in ‘ EK Museo Lundii,’ these main sections are,
however, worked up to date, whereby they become of very imme-
diate importance. * * * JI was just about to thank Winge for
his gift when your letter came. It gives me, at least, the hope
that the material for the following volumes lies ready. It would
gladden my heart for the sake of mammalogy, if it were so. For
our knowledge of mammals is exceedingly indebted to Winge.
Through the originality of his mind, his extensive knowledge, his
sharp criticism, the logical working out of his views, he decidedly
belonged among the first mammalogists of our day. * * * Asa
young graduate I frequently visited Norway; I was then interested
in the writings of the Sars, father and son, and learned to read Nor-
wegian. In this way also Danish zoology was opened up to me, and
1 discovered how many treasures lay concealed in Danish garb.
1 thus became an admirer of Danish zoological work. It was there-
fore a source of gratification to me to be able to bring H. Winge’s
‘Om Pattedyrenes Tandskifte’ of 1882, which was practically un-
known in non-Scandinavian circles, into full daylight, as it de-
served, and to point out that Winge is the real forerunner and origi-
522 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1924

nator of the ideas about the evolution of mammalian teeth, as they
are represented in the Cope-Osborn theory, which has grown so
famous. Unfortunately, his numerous later writings about mammals
shared the same fate and did not become as well known as they de-
served. I have always been striving to call attention to their great
importance. The Danish language was a hindrance to making them
known in wider circles, not to speak of including them in the
mammalogists’ every day literary apparatus. This has doubtless
‘been to the great harm of science. * * * As I had the privi-
lege of knowing Winge personally, I know his reluctance to publish
in another language than his mother tongue. I can thus imagine
that there may be ethical obstacles in translating into another lan-
guage his ‘ Pattedyr-Slaegter,’ which is, in reality, a kind of scien-
tific testament. Otherwise a translation of ‘ Pattedyr-Slaegter ’
would be a ‘ monumentum aere perennius,’ which many might admire,
and which would be of use to many, while in its Danish garment it
is confined to a small circle of admirers.”

I hope with these words to have given you an impression both of
Winge’s noble personality and of his exceedingly great contribution
to Danish science. At the Zoological Museum, to which he conse-
crated his powers from his earliest youth to his last day, nobody
will for the present be able to fill his place. We, his colleagues,
can never forget him, and also here in the Academy of Sciences that
had the honor of counting him among its members, we shall cherish
his memory.
