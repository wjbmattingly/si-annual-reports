REPORT OF PROFESSOR HENRY, SECRETARY OF THE SMITH-
SONIAN INSTITUTION, TO THE BOARD OF REGENTS, FOR THE
YEAR 1876.

GENTLEMEN: I| have the honor herewith to present to your board the
report of the condition and operations of the Smithsonian Institution
for the year 1876, it being the thirtieth report which I have been per-
mitted to submit to your honorable body.

INTRODUCTION.

The long term of service of the principal executive officer of the In-
stitution, and the few changes in the presiding officer of the Board of
of Regents, have been attended with the important result of an unin-
terrupted continuity in the policy of the management of the establish-
ment. A definite conception of the will of Smithson, and of the means
best adapted to realize its intention, was clearly apprehended at the be-
ginning, and a plan proposed and partially adopted which would carry
out, in the most effectual manner, the ideas expressed in the terms of
the bequest. Unfortunately Congress did not delegate to the Board of
Regents the power of entirely organizing the Institution, but specified
certain objects which should be included in the plan adopted. It will,
however, be seen by an examination of the whole series of annual re-
ports, that while due regard has been had to the requirements of Con-
gress, the prominent object kept constantly in view has been the full
introduction of the plan of increasing and diffusing knowledge by
means of researches, publications, and exchanges. This plan, which is
known as that of active operations, and which has received the approba-
tion of the scientific world, was not generally understood at the time of
the organization of the establishment. The value of scientific research
was not as highly appreciated then as at the present day, and therefore
it is not surprising that Congress should devote the income of the fund
principally to the formation of a library, a museum, and a gallery of art.

These objects, though important in themselves, are all of a local char-
acter, being principally confined in their influence to the city of Wash-
ington, and therefore could not realize the liberal intention of Smithson,
which includes in its comprehensive scope the intellectual advancement
of mankind.

Although a majority of the Board of Regents were in favor of the
plan of active operations, they did not think it prudent to ask Congress
at that time to reconsider the plan which it had adopted, but concluded
to proceed without delay in executing the measures prescribed, while at

the same time they availed themselves of the privilege granted in one
7
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of the sections of the act of organization to partially introduce and
gradually develop the plan of active operations.

In conformity with the act of Congress, a building has been erected
at a cost of upwards of $500,000. A library of 70,000 volumes has
been colleected—principally of a class of books of the highest value,
consisting of the transactions and proceedings of learned societies—
with provision for its annual increase. The museum of the Government
has been enlarged to more than ten times its original size, a new depart-
ment having been added to it, viz, that of American Indian Ethnogra-
phy, which is more extended and varied in specimens than any other
ever established. A gallery of art has also been formed, which is es-
pecially rich in illustrations of industrial arts. In addition, a consider-
able proportion of the income of the Smithson fund has been expended
on the improvement of the grounds surrounding the building. In short,
every item of the original requirement of Congress has received due
attention.

To effect these objects, and at the same time to develop the plan of
active operations, it became necessary to increase the income of the
fund, and this has been accomplished by the adoption of a system of rigid
economy and by a judicious investment of the savings of the income.

The original amount of the fund of $541,379 has been increased to
$714,000. Instead of forming the library by the purchase of books, it
has been created principally through exchanges, while the expense of
maintaining it has been obviated by depositing the books in the Library
of Congress. The care of the grounds, which was avery expensive item,
has been assumed by the Government, and the cost of maintaining the
museum is now defrayed by an annual congressional appropriaiion. The
Institution having thus happily been relieved from the support of these
burdens, is now, at the end of the third decade of its history, in a con-
dition to fully realize the conception of its character as originally set
forth in the first annual report of the Secretary, while the success of the
plan of active operations has fully vindicated the propriety of its adop-
tion. Through its operation the Institution has advanced almost every
branch of science, and has made the name of Smithson known wherever
civilization exists.

It has published twenty-one quarto volumes of transactions, entitled
‘Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge,” twelve octavo volumes of
‘¢ Miscellaneous Collections,” and thirty octavo annual reports. These
publications have been presented to the principal libraries of the Old
and New World. It has especially advanced natural history and eth-
nology by the large number of specimens it has collected and distrib-
uted to foreign and domestic museums, and has been instrumental in
widely diffusing a knowledge of the progress of science by its system of
international exchanges between the United States and all other parts
of the world. The system of “ active operations,” while advancing the
interests of civilization generally, has been of importance to Washington
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

City in assisting to constitute it a centre of scientific and literary activ-
ity, and in co-operating with other institutions here established. Be-
sides contributing to render ‘the Library of Congress the first in the
United States in the number and value of the books which it contains,
it has deposited in the Department of Agriculture 30,000 specimens of
plants, and many other objects connected with agriculture. It has also
deposited with the Army Medical Museum a large collection of osteo-
logical specimens, and a series of skulls for the especial illustration of
the craniology of the North American Continent. It has affiliated itself
with the Coreoran Art Gallery, and deposited with that admirable insti-
tution the specimens of engravings received from its foreign correspond-
ents, as well as a number of valuable pictures belonging to its collection.

From this sketch of the past and present condition of the Institution,
it will, I think, be generally admitted that the trust has been faithfully
administered, and that, although changes have been found necessary
in the plan adopted by Congress, yet these have been only such as orig-
inated from the peculiar nature of the bequest and the difficulty, from
a priort conceptions, of adopting the most efficient means of realizing
the intentions of the donor.

The principal event of the year 1876 connected with the Institution
is its display of specimens at the International Exposition in Philadel-
pbia. It was stated in the last annual report that Congress had made
an appropriation to enable the Institution to participate with the
several Departments of the Government in the Centennial Exhibition.
After careful consideration of the subject it was concluded that the part
of the Government exhibition under the special charge of the Institu-
tion should consist of such articles as would illustrate (1) the character
and operations of the Institution itself, (2) the mineral and animal re-
sources, (3) the ethnology, and (4) the fishery industries of the United
States. The responsibility of collecting and arranging'these objects, as
' well as of representing the Institution. at the Centennial Exhibition, was
intrusted to Prof. S. F. Baird, assistant secretary of the Institution, °
who, with a corps of assistants principally engaged for the occasion,
discharged the arduous duties assigned him in a highly satisfactory
manner.

The part of the Government display under the auspices of the In-
Stitution has been pronounced by competent judges one of the most
interesting and complete of the kind ever exhibited. The portion which
illustrated the character and operations of the Institution embraced full
sets of the three classes of its publications, a series of tables showing
the extent and importance of the system of international exchange, and a
number of large charts exhibiting the results of the system of meteorology
founded by the Institution; that illustrating the mineral wealth of the
country contained an extensive series of the oresof the precious and ordi-
nary metals, with their products, the principal varieties of coal, the clays,
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

marbles, slates, and other building materials, the several varieties of pe-
troleum and coal-tar, &c., &c.—in short, a most extended collection
of specimens of large size showing at one view the vast mineral resources
of the United States, to which was added a variety of specimens to rep-
resent the different stages of the manufactured articles derived from the
mineral kingdom. The display of the animal resources of the country
was also extensive and various. It embraced all the species capable of
economical application and such animals as were of special interest to
the naturalist. These were represented by stuffed specimens, by life-
size plaster models and by photographs. The industrial application of
these animals was also exhibited as well as the apparatus by which they
are pursued, captured and utilized. Among the larger mammals were
well mounted specimens of those most valued for food, as the different
kinds of deer, including the moose, elk and caribou, the musk-ox, and
the buffalo; and the fur-bearing species were represented by bears, the
grizzly, brown, black, and white; by the foxes, yellow, black, cross,
gray, and kit; by wolves, fur-seals, sea-lions, sables, and minks ; the oil-
producing animals by whales, porpoises, and other cetaceans. Another
part of the animal display embraced a series of specimens of animal
food preserved by being dried, smoked, salted, pickled, and canned, to-
gether with representations of the various applications of the teeth,
bones, horns, and scales; and, again, of articles used for clothing, as
furs, leather, &c.

The ethnological branch of the Exposition was at the joint expense of
the congressional appropriation for the Indian Bureau and that for the
Smithsonian Institution. Special importance was attached to this sec-
tion of the Exposition, and great exertion made to render it as complete
as possible. To this end, agents were temporarily employed to obtain
articles to illustrate the ethnology of portions of the country hitherto
imperfectly known. The success of the enterprise was commensurate
with the energy expended, anda more extensive and varied collection
of articles was obtained to illustrate the past and present condition of
the various native tribes of the American continent than was ever
before exhibited. It consisted of a large number of the different varie-
ties of specimens of the stone age from all parts of the continent and
the West Indies, and a series of articles in use at the present time
among the Indians, especially among tribes which have had but little
connection with the white race. There were also exhibited numerous
life-size figures to show every variety of Indian costume and personal
decoration. Independent of the temporary interest which was subserved
by this exhibition, the large collection of new articles has rendered an
important service to the ethnology of the country, since these articles
will be preserved for scientific study in the National Museum.

In addition to the foregoing, representatives, in plaster, papier-maché,
and photography, of all the edible fishes of our coast were exhibited,
in connection with the Smithsonian display, by the United States Fish
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11

Commission, of which Professor Baird is the head. But for a full
account of the part of the Centennial Exhibition known as the Govern-
ment, or United States, exhibition, I must refer to the reports of Profes-
sor Baird in the appendix to my last and that of my present report.

The anticipations expressed in the last report in regard to the addi-
tions which would be made to the National Museum through the agency
of the Centennial Exhibition have been fully realized. These additions
consist of new specimens procured by the direct agency of the Institu-
tion, particularly for the exhibition ; of donations from various States of
the Union, from individuals, and especially from foreign exhibitors.
These will require more than three times as much space for their dis-
play as was required by the previous collections of the Museum. To
preserve and exhibit this increase, or to render it available for educa-
tional and scientific purposes, an additional building is imperatively de-
manded. The appropriation for erecting this building must be fur-
nished by Congress, since the idea cannot for a moment be entertained
of making it from the Smithson fund. Furthermore, the building
should be an extension, as it were, of the present Smithsonian edi-
fice, since if the National Museum is entirely transferred to another
building the Institution would have left upon it, for support, a building
erected from the income of the Smithson fund almost entirely for the
accommodation of the Government collections and far too large and ex-
pensive for its own use. I beg leave, therefore, to repeat the suggestion
made in my last report, that the Government be asked to take entire
possession of the present edifice for the use of the Museum, to enlarge
it so as to meet the present emergency, and to repay to the Institution at
least a part of its cost; a portion of the sum thus repaid to be applied to
providing other accommodations for the Institution in a building better
adapted to its operations, and far less expensive in its maintenance;
and the remainder to be added to the permanent fund for the increase
of the power and efficiency of the establishment.

I may further be allowed to remark that the experience of the last
year has strengthened my opinion as to the propriety of a separation of
the Institution from the National Museum. The events of this period
have proved that the Museum is destined to become an extensive estab
lishment involving a large annual expenditure for its support and a
variety of complex operations having no necessary connection with the
plan adopted by the Institution for the “increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge among men.” Smithson gave his own name to the establishment
which he founded, thereby indicating that he intended it as a monu-
ment to his memory, and in strict regard to this item of his will the
endowment of his bequest should be administered separate from all other
Junds, and the results achieved by it should be accredited to his name alone.
The Institution should not, therefore, be merged in an establishment of
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the Government, but should stand alone, free to the unobstructed
observation of the whole world, and keep in perpetual remembrance the
name of its generous founder. The functions of the Museum and of the
Institution are entirely different. The object of the former is the estab-
lishment of a collection of specimens of nature and of art which shall
exhibit the natural resources and industry of the country, or present at
one view the materials essential to a condition of high civilization which
exists in the different States of the American Union; to show the various
processes of manufacture which have been adopted by us, as well as
those used in other countries; in short, to form a great educational estab-
lishment, by means of which the inhabitants of our own country as well as
those of foreign lands who visit our shores may be informed as to the
means which exist in the United States for the enjoyment of human life
in the present and their improvement in the future. The Smithsonian
Institution, on the other hand, does not offer the results of its opera-
tions to the physical eye, but presents them to the mind in the form of
new discoveries, derived from new investigations and an extended ex-
change of new ideas with all parts of the world.

It is the design of the Museum to continually increase its collection
of material objects; of the Institution, to extend the bounds of human
knowledge. The latter collects nothing for preservation of a material
character. Itis true it sends out explorers and makes large collections,
but these are for distribution to museums, colleges and academies, or to
all establishments in which they can be useful in the way of the extension
of science or the advancement of education. Every civilized govern-
ment of the world has its museum which it supports with a liberality
commensurate with its intelligence and financial ability, while there
is but one Smithsonian Institution—that is, an establishment having
expressly for its object “the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.” The conception of such an institution—not a local estab-
lishment intended to improve tle intellectual condition of any single
city or any single nation, but that of mankind in general—was worthy
of the mind of Smithson, and the intelligence and integrity of the
United States are both involved in the proper administration of the
trust, since the terms in which it was conveyed must be truly inter-
preted and the intention expressed rigidly carried out. |

It has been supposed that the Institution has derived much benefit
from its connection with the Museum in the way of adding to its popu-
larity, but it should be recollected that the Institution is not a popular
establishment and that it does not depend for its support upon public
patronage, but that it is an establishment founded on the bequest of an
individual, and that the very nature of its operations, involving study
aud investigation, is in a considerable degree incompatible with con-
tinued interruption from large numbers of visitors. So far from the
Institution having derived advantage from the connection which has
existed between it and the Museum, the latter has proved a serious ob-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

stacle in the way of the full development of the plan of the former in
having absorbed, in the erection of the building and in the appropria-
tions for the care of the specimens, at least one-half of the whole income
of the Smithson fund. Furthermore, the Museum and also the Institu-
tion have now arrived at such a state of development that the two can
scarcely be continued under one organization.

But the most objectionable result of the present connection of the
two establishments is the uecessity of the Institution appealing to Con-
gress annually for appropriations for the support of the Museum,
whereby, in the language of my last report, the Institution is presented
to the world as a suppliant for perpetual aid, whereas, for carrying out
the legitimate objects of the bequest, no annual appropriation is neces-
sary from the public Treasury; for, although more than one-half of the
whole income of the Smithson bequest has been devoted to a Museum
and other local objects, it has succeeded, through its researches, publi-
cations, and exchanges, in establishing a reputation as extensive as Civ-
ilization itself.

In this connection it may be stated that an important step has been
made at the present session of Congress toward recognizing the
National Museum as a separate establishment. In the language of the
Act making appropriation for deficiencies, it is for the first time
announced as an ‘appropriation for the National Museum in charge of
the Smithsonian Institution.”

Since the meeting of the board on the 24th instant, I have trans-
mitted to the Senate and House of Representatives the resolutions
adopted by the Regents relative to the necessity for the erection of an
additional building in connection with the Institution, and have con-
ferred with several members of Congress as to the probability of obtain-
ing an appropriation for this purpose. These have given encourage-
ment as to the probable appropriation of $250,000 for the erection of
the proposed building,* but do not think that the proposition to pur-
chase the Smithsonian building would at this time, on account of the
condition of the Government finances, meet with favorable considera-
tion. The proposition should, however, be kept before the public, and
in due time, I doubt not, it will be adopted.

General M. C. Meigs, Quartermaster-General, United States Army,
who had charge of the extension of the United States Capitol, and has
had much experience in the construction of public buildings, has gratui-
tously furnished a plan for a new building for the Museum, and in
addition generously offers his assistance in superintending its construc-
- tion. This building will be of durable though inexpensive material, and
expressly adapted to the uses for which it is designed. In its con-

14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

struction care will be exercised not to sacrifice utility to architectural
effect, but the fact will be kept in view that architecture is essentially
a useful art, and that the mind receives pleasure and improvement from
the contemplation of perfect adaptability no less than from imposing
exterior effect.

The operations of the Institution during the past year, independent
of those connected with the Centennial, have been carried on with un-

abated energy.
FINANCES.

I am happy to inform the Regents that the finances of the Institution
are still in a favorable condition and that from the First National Bank
has been received the last instalment of the money which was on deposit
at the time of its suspension. The Institution bas therefore lost nothing
on this account, except the interest of the money which might have ac-
crued from its investment.

The following is a statement of the condition of the fund at the begin-
ning of the year 1877:

The amount originally received as the bequest of James

Smithson, of England, deposited in the Treasury of the

United States in accordance with the act of Congress of

(For a detailed account of the expenditures, &c., see report of execu-
tive committee.)

From this it appears that the total fund, including the Virginia stock
at its present value and the cash on hand at the end of the year, amounts
to $714,029.18. The receipts during the year 1876 were $47,486.21, and
the expenditures $46,978.21, leaving a balance of $508 to be added to
the balance on hand at the beginning of 1876. The interest on the
Hamilton bequest has been received to December 31, 1876, and, in ac-
Cordance with the terms of the will, an appropriation was made from it
for an archeological exploration in bone-caverns in the vicinity of Car-
lisle, Pa., the former residence ot Mr. Hamilton. The final results
will be given to the world accredited to James Hamilton, and in this way
his name will be perpetuated with that of Smithson, and his donation
serve as an example to be followed by others who may desire to benefit
the world and live in the history of science long after their departure
from this life. ,

The interest on the Virginia bonds received during the year was
$2,907.75. The marketable value of this investment remains about the
same as it was at the date of the last report.

A fact which has been omitted through inadvertence in previous
reports should here be mentioned, that the Institution is greatly in-
debted to our highly esteemed fellow-citizen, W. W. Corcoran, esq., for
valuable suggestions in its early financial history; and especially for
the transferring to the Regents, at par, instead of at the market value,
of $240,000 of United States bonds as a safe investment of the amount
of accumulated interest devoted to the erection of the building.

PUBLICATIONS.

Since the reports of the Institution are separately distributed to many
persons who have not ready access to the whole series, it is necessary
in each succeeding one to repeat certain facts which may serve to give
an idea of the general organization of the establishment. The following
statement is therefore repeated :

The publications of the Institution are of three classes, viz, the Con-
TRKIBUTIONS TO KNOWLEDGE, the MISCELLANEOUS COLLECTIONS, and
the ANNUAL REporRTS. The first consists of memoirs containing positive
additions to science resting on original research, and which are generally
the result of investigations to which the Institution has, in some way,
rendered assistance. The Miscellaneous Collections are composed of
works intended to facilitate the study of various branches of natural his-
tory, meteorology, &c., and are principally designed to induce individuals
to engage in these studies as specialties. The Annual Reports, besides
an account of the operations, expenditures, and condition of the Insti-
tution, contain translations from works not generally accessible to Amer-
ican students, reports of lectures, extracts from correspondence, &c.
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The following are the rules which have been adopted for the distribu-
tion of the several publications of the Institution :

Ist. They are presented to learned societies of the first class which in
return give complete series of their publications to the Institution.

2d. To libraries of the first class which give in exchange their cata-
logues and other publications, or an equivalent from their duplicate
volumes.

3d. To colleges of the first class which furnish catalogues of their
libraries and of their students, and all other publications relative to
their organization and history.

4th. To States and Territories, provided they give in return copies of
all documents published under their authority.

Sth. To public libraries in this country, containing 15,000 volumes,
especially if no other copies are given in the same place; and to smaller
libraries where a large district would be otherwise unsupplied.

6th. To institutions devoted exclusively to the promotion of particu-
lar branches of knowledge are given such Smithsonian publications as
relate to their respective objects.

7th. The Annual Reports are presented to the meteorological observ-

ers, to contributors of valuable material to the library or collections,
and to persons engaged in special scientific research.
' The distribution of the publications of the Institution is a matter
which requires much care and judicious selection, the great object being
to make known to the world the traths which may result from the ex-
penditure of the Smithson fund. Tor this purpose the principal class
of publications, namely, the Contributious, must be so distributed as to
be accessible to the greatest number of readers, and this will evidently
be to large central libraries.

The volumes of Contributions are presented on the express condition
that, while they are carefully preserved, they shall be accessible at all
times to students and others who may desire to consult them, and be
returned to the Institution in case the establishments to which they are
presented at any time cease to exist. These works, it must be recol-
lected, are not of a popular character, but require profound study to
fully understand them; they are, however, of importance to the pro-
fessional teacher and the popular expounder of science. They contain
materials from which general treatises ou special subjects may be elab-
orated.

The publications of the Institution during the past jear are mainly
those described in previous reports and which have been in process of
preparation for a series of years. They form two volumes of the Smith-
sonian Contributions to Knowledge, XX and XXI, made up of separate
papers.

The twentieth volume of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowl-
edge consists of one memoir only, entitled, Tae Winds of the Globe, or
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. de

the Laws of Atmospheric Circulation over the Surface of the Earth; by
James Henry Coffin, LL.D., Professor of Mathematics and ers
in Lafayette College, Ears The tables of this volume were
completed after the author’s decease, and the maps drawn by Selden
Jennings Coffin, professor of mathematics in the same institution.
There is added to the work a discussion and analysis of the tables and
charts, by Dr. Alexander Woeikof, late secretary of the meteorological
committee of the Imperial Geographical Society of Russia. This volume
consists of 781 quarto pages, 2 wood-cuts, and 26 plates or charts. We
consider it, perhaps, the most important contribution to knowledge
which the Institution has given to the world. It presents a rich mine
of information for the use of the meteorologist, the physical geographer,
and the mariner, thus combining materials of abstract scientific inter-
est with knowledge immediately applicable to the practical affairs of life.

The twenty-first volume of Contributions to Knowledge consists of
the following articles, viz:

1. Statement and Exposition of Certain Harmonies of the Solar Sys-
tem. By Stephen Alexander, LL. D., Professor of Astronomy in the
College of New Jersey. 104 pages, 20 wood-cuts.

2. On the General Integrals of ‘Planetary Motion. By Simon New-
comb, Professor of Mathematics, United States Navy. 40 pages.

3. The Haidah Indians of Queen Charlotte’s Island, British Colum-
bia; with a brief description of their carvings, tattoo designs, &e. By
James G. Swan, Port Townsend, Washington Territory. 22 pages, 7
plates.

4. Tables, Distribution, and Variations of the Atmospheric Temper-
ature in the United Siatos, and some adjacent parts of America. Col-
lected by the Smithsonian Institution, and discussed under the direction
of Joseph Henry, Secretary. By Charles A. Schott, Assistant, United
States Coast Survey. 3560 pages, 9 diagrams, 2 plates, 3 charts. The
whole volume consists of 543 pages, and 41 illustrations.

The work on Temperature, as we have stated in previous reports, con-
sists of the results of the discussion of all the existing material which
could be collected of observations of temperature in the United States,
illustrated with large maps and a number of wood-euts. It is published
separately and also as a part of the series of volumes of “ Contributions.”
The compilation of the materials and their discussion were intrusted
to Mr. Charles A. Schott, of the Coast Survey, assisted by a number of
computers at the expense of the Smithson fund.

In previous reports mention has been made of an extensive publica-
tion in preparation for the Institution, on the Antiquities of Tennessee,
_ by Dr. Joseph Jones, of the medical department of the University of
Louisiana, at New Orleans. Some years ago a small appropriation was
made by the Institution to assist this gentleman in his exploration. He
pursued his investigations with great ardor and success. In presenting an
outline of his explorations he states that an effort was made to accomplish

two results: first, the accurate description of the aboriginal remains, and,
second, the collection and classification of such facts as bore on their
obscure history. The work when first submitted to the Institution was
found to contain more historical and bibliographical matter selected
from known authorities than could properly be considered contributions
to existing knowledge, and it was therefore returned to the author for
revision and abridgment. The omissions and modifications desired hay-
ing been made, the work has been published during the past year.
Some idea of its character may be obtained from the following titles of
the chapters:

Burial caves.

Modes of burial practiced by the aborigines of America.

Mounds, fortifications, and earth-works.

Karth-works on the Big Harpeth River.

Larth-works on the West Harpeth and Big Harpeth Rivers.

The stone fort, and other aboriginal remains.

Relics from the mounds and stone graves.

General conclusions.

It forms a volume of 181 quarto pages with 85 wood-cuts and a very
full index prepared by Prof. O. T. Mason. It will constitute a part of
the twenty-second volume of the Contributions to Knowledge.

Another quarto work published during the year, and which was pre-
pared especially for distribution at the Centennial Exposition, is that on
the Archeological Collections of the United States National Museum in
charge of the Smithsonian Institution, by Prof. Charles Rau. This work
consists of 118 quarto pages, illustrated by 340 wood-cuts, and an
account of it will be found under the head of Ethnology.

Miscellaneous collections.—In previous reports a work was described
of which the first part had been published, entitled “The Constants of
Nature,” compiled gratuitously for the Institution by Prof. F. W. Clarke.
This part was on the specific gravity, boiling and melting point and
chemical formula of 2,572 distinet bodies, including over 5,000 deter-
minations. During the past year a supplement to this part has been
published consisting of the determinations of specific gravities, boiling-
points and melting-points made since 1873. In it the determinations
are given for nearly 700 substances, of which at least 400 are new. It
is embraced in 61 octavo pages.

Part If of the same general work has also been published during the
past year. Itis entitled “A table of specific heats for solids and liquids,”
consisting of 58 octavo pages, including 410 substances.

Part III has also been printed, consisting of “Tables of expansion by
heat for solids and liquids.” It gives data for the expansion of about
350 different substances, no liquid mixtures or solutions, however, being
included. It occupies 57 octavo pages. This work has been much
called for by practical chemists and physicists. It will be continued
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

from time to time as the author, amid other professional engagements
in the University of Cincinnati, can find leisure to select and verify the
materials.

In the year 1875 another series of publications was commenced which
forms a part of the Miscellaneous Collections. It is entitled ‘The
Bulletins of the National Museum,” and is intended to illustrate the
collections of natural history and ethnology belonging to the United
States, of which the Smithsonian Institution is the custodian. Six
numbers of these Bulletins have been published. They are prepared at
the request of the Institution by different individuals, and sre printed
by the authority of the Secretary of the Interior at the Government
Printing-Office.

The following is a list of these Bulletins:

I. Check-list of North American Batrachia and Reptilia; with a sys-
tematic list of the higher groups, and an essay on geographical distribu-
tion, based on the specimens contained in the United States National
Museum. By Edward D. Cope. 1875. 8vo, 108 pp.

II. Contributions to the Natural History of Kerguelen Island, made in
connection with the American Transit of Venus Expedition, 1874~75,
By J. H. Kidder, M. D., U.S. N.- Part I, Ornithology, edited by Dr.
Elliott Coues, U.S. A. 1875. 8vo, 62 pp.

III. Part Il of the foregoing, consisting of Oology, Botany, Geology,
Mammals, Fish, Mollusks, Insects, Crustaceans, Anuelids, Echinoderms,

of the United States. <A list of substances derived from the animal
kingdom, with synopsis of the useful and injurious animals, and a class-
ification of the methods of capture and utilization. By G. Brown
Goode, assistant curator United States National Museum. 1876. 8vo,
140 pp. .

An account of the first two of the Bulletins was given in the last an-
nual report.

The third number of the series, that on the natural history of Kergue-
len Island, by Dr. J. H. Kidder, United States Navy, embodies the re-
sult of the examination of the eggs, the identification of the plants,
fishes, mollusks, insects, &c., of the region. It also contains a brief
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

description of the collections of Surgeon Kershner, of the United States
Navy, in the Chatham and Auckland Islands, and in New Zealand, and
of Mr. I. Russell in the latter place.

The botany of Kerguelen Island had previously been very thoroughly
studied by Dr. J. D. Hooker in connection with Sir James Clarke Ross’s
Antarctic Expedition, (1539~41.) A number of new phanerogams, ferns,
sea-plants, and lichens have been added to the list.

The zoological collections, though comparatively small, contain an
unusual number of new genera and species, especially among the mol-
lusea, insects, crustacea, echinoderms, &c., descriptions of which have
been furnished to Dr. Kidder by Professors Verrill, 8S. I. Smith, Dall,
Ostensacken, and Hagen.

The Bulletin concludes with a study of Chionis minor, a unique and
little-known bird, with an attempt to establish its proper position in
classification.

Bulletin No. 4, the catalogue of birds collected by Prof. Francis Su-
michrast in Southwestern Mexico, is a scientific account of the collection
made in accordance with an arrangement between the Smithsonian In-
stitution and Professor Sumichrast for an extended exploration of the
Pacific side of the Isthmus of Tehuantepec for the purpose of procuring
specimens of its natural history. During the past four years, four instal-
ments of birds have been received and examined by Mr. Lawrence, con-
taining 321 species, represented by more than 1,700 specimens, all of a
remarkably fine character, and bearing testimony to Professor Sumi-
chrast’s efficiency as an industrious and energetic collector, while the
character of the many valuable notes he has coutributed manifest his
minuteness and intelligence as an observer.

From this exploration it appears that the region of the Pacific is com-
paratively much poorer in birds than that of the Atlantic. This is
attributed to the extreme dryness of the soil, to the scarcity of vegeta-
tion and of insect life, and to the duration of the winds from the north-
east and southwest, which there prevail with great violence. The con-
traction of the American continent. between the ninety-fourth and
ninety-fifth degrees of longitude west from Greenwich, forms what is
called, improperly perhaps, the Isthmus of Tehuantepec. In a physical
point of view, it may be considered as divided into three parts: first,
an eastern, extending from the Gulf of Mexico to the Puerta; second, a
central, from the Puerta to the Chivela; and, third, a western, from the
Chivela to the Pacific. The eastern part has its largest portion covered
with thick and damp forests, vegetation which rivals the greatest
beauties of the tropics. The central region presents an undulating sur-
face embossed with innumerable hills which gradually unite on the
western side with the mountains of the Sierras. Although watered by
numerous streams, it presents but a scanty vegetation, essentially
characterized by oaks on one side and palm-trees on the other. The
western division, or plains of the Pacific, is very dry, and presents
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21

a striking contrast to the rich plains on the Atlantic slope. The num-
ber of animal forms, as well as the vegetable, decreases perceptibly in
proportion as we advance from the Atlantic to the Pacific. It is wor-
thy of note that while the species belonging to the western province sel-
dom, if ever, find their way to the eastern division, those, on the contrary,
in the latter province, spread to within a short distance of the shores of
the Pacific. The difference in the elevation of the ground which exerts
in Mexico such a great influence over the geographical distribution of
animal species, exists only in a slight degreein the Isthmus of Tehuan-
tepec, the highest point of the territory, not being elevated more than
from 500 to 2,800 feet above the level of the sea.

The fifth bulletin, a “ Catalogue of the Fishes of the Bermudas,” is
based chiefly upon collections in: the United States National Museum,
made and described by G. Brown Goode.

A visit to the Bermudas during the months of February and March,
1872, afforded the author opportunities for collecting the notes and
specimens upon which this paperis based. At the time of his visit only
seven species of fishes had been recorded from this locality, and the
only authentic information regarding the fish-fauna was contained in
one short chapter of a work by John Matthew Jones, of England. In
the present list, Mr. Goode enumerates seventy-five species, most of
which were personally observed.

Bulletin No. 6 consists of a tabular classification prepared by Pro-
fessor Goode, to facilitate the work of collecting and arranging the
materials gathered by the Institution for the International Exhibition,
to illustrate the resources of the United States as derived from the ani-
mal kingdom. With a view to its future use in the classification of the
articles of the kind which it includes, it is presented in a permanent
form as a part of the Miscellaneous Collections. It forms a pamphlet of
140 octavo pages, of which the following are the several divisions: The
first group, section A, is an index of the whole series, including all
North American animals which are directly beneficial or injurious to
man. Section B embraces all instruments and methods employed by
the hunters, trappers, and fishermen of North America, aboriginal and
civilized. It is a monograph of all matters relating to the chase and
fisheries of the country. Section C includes all methods of utilizing an-
imal products. Section D presents a list of all useful substances derived
from the animal kingdom, and section E all articles illustrating the cul-
ture and protection of useful animals. Though this work was hurriedly
prepared for use at the Centennial Exhibition, and is necessarily incom-
plete, yet it will serve as a basis for other attempts of a similar char-
acter, and will be of especial use in making preparation for future Inter-
national Exhibitions.

Centennial Outline Map of the United States and other portions of North
America.—In order to serve as a basis for showing the larger features
22 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of the physical geography, and to present graphically any special sta-
tistics of the United States to accompany the exhibits from the Smith-
sonian Institution at the International Exhibition of 1876, it was
deemed desirable to have constructed an outline map on a scale suffi-
ciently large for that purpose. The design and construction of this map
were intrusted to Mr. W. L. Nicholson, topographer of the Post-Ofiice
Department, and from the drawings prepared under his care a number
of prints were made by lithograph transfer. The map is on a scale of
16 miles to the inch, (1: 1,013,760,) in 20 sheets. covering, when mounted,
an area of 163 feet long, (horizontally,) by 15 feet wide, (vertically,)
extending from the southern shores of Lake Winnepeg and Hudson’s
Bay to the parallel of 15° north latitude, taking in the whole of the
Gulf of Mexico, Yucatan, and the larger West India Islands. From
east to west it includes parts of Nova Scotia and of Vancouver Island,
the Territory of Alaska being shown, on a smaller scale, detached, in a
vacant corner of the map. The meridians and parallels were laid down
from the polyconic-projection tables of the United States Coast Survey
Office. The details are restricted to the more general topographical (and
political) features—the shore-lines of the oceans and great lakes, the
principal rivers, the State and international boundaries, and a few of
the larger cities, the mountain-topograpky being omitted, as one of the
desiderata for additions to such a map of this continent.

The original construction and the printing of this map were under-
taken by the Smithsonian Institution, but, as an offset toward the re-
imbursement of this expense, propositions were made and accepted
from several of the subcommissions of the United States executive
departments exhibiting at Philadelphia for the purchase of a limited
number of copies of the map. Under these arrangements, the Agricul-
tural Department made mse of a series of six of these maps, ex-
hibiting by colors, in a very effective manner, statistics of the value
of farm-lands, wages of farm-labor, areas of woodland, products of
sugar-crops, of textile fibers, and of fruits. The Light-House Board
employed one for showing the sites of and the relative orders of all the
light-houses along the sea-coast, the great lakes, and the Mississippi,
Missouri, and Ohio Rivers. The Post-Office Department made use of
one to show the railway mail-service of the United States. Various
bureaus of the Department of the Interior, including the Census, Educa-
tion, and Geological Survey of the Territories, used several sets of the
same.

The Smithsonian Institution exhibited four of these maps for present-
ing the results of the meteorological discussions of rain-fall and of
temperature over the United States in the summer and winter months.
These were enlargements from the maps accompanying the publications
of the Smithsonian Institution. On these four maps an attempt was made,
by the addition of the greater mountain chains, to give a coincident
view of their relation to the great climatic elements.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

A fifth set of the sheets was used for representing the geology of the
United States and Territories.

There now remain on hand several sets of the original prints of this
large outline map, available for purposes similiar to the foregoing, and
which it is proposed to dispose of to institutions or associations willing,
by a small proportionate outlay, to aid in the re-imbursement of the
original expenses.

Annual report.—The annual report of the operations of the Institution
for the year 1875 was presented to Congress on the 7th of April, 1876, but
the extra copies ordered as usual were not delivered to the Institution
until December, and their distribution has therefore only just now com-
menced. An edition of 10,500 copies was printed, 1,000 for the use of
the Senate, 2,000 for the House of Representatives, and 7,500 for the
Institution. The appendix to the report contains translations of Arago’s
eulogy on Volta; DeCandolle on the probable future of the human race;
the annual report for 1873-74 on the transactions of the Geneva Society
of Physics and Natural History; a lecture on the past and future of
geology, by Prof. Joseph Prestwich, of England; a report on the dimi-
nution of the water of rivers and streams, by a committee of the Royal
Academy of Vienna; an original communication on the refraction of
sound, by Wm. Bb. Taylor, of Washington; a letter by Professor Henry
on the organization of local scientific societies, intended to furnish an
answer to numerous letters addressed to the Institution on this subject;
a translation of a proposed international code of symbols for charts of
prehistoric archeology, by Profs. Mortillet and Chantre; an article on
characteristics pertaining to ancient man in Michigan, by Henry Gill-
man; anda memoir on the stone-age in New Jersey, by Dr. C. C. Abbott.

RESEARCHES.

It has been stated in previous reports that an annual appropriation
was made for several years to enable Professor Newcomb, of the Na-
tional Observatory, to employ accountants for the reduction of the
mathematical expressions of the orbits of the planets Uranus and Nep-
tune to numerical tabular results.

Although the representation of the observations of Uranus by the
tables presented to the Smithsonian Institution four years ago, was
regarded by astronomers generally as highly satisfactory, it was not so
considered by the author, owing to the systematic character of the mi-
nute discrepancies. He therefore desired to ascertain whether these
discrepancies arose from errors in the computation of the perturbations
of Uranus, and, if not, whether they could be due to the action of an
ultra-Neptunian planet. The first step in the investigation was to have
a complete duplicate computation of the perturbations from 1753 until
the present time, by the method of mechanical quadratures, with which
to compare the results computed from the tables. An appropriation
24 REPORI OF THE SECRETARY.

having been made by the Institution for this investigation, it has been
found that there is a small discrepancy between the two sets of results,
the cause of which has not yet been ascertained.

Tf it is found on further examination that there is really a discrepancy
between the observations of Uranus and its motion as computed from
the theory of gravitation, it will be considered that the chance of the
discrepancy being due to an ultra-Neptunian planet is sufficient to jus-
tify the continuance of the work.

Professor Newcomb remarks that the problem now before us is vastly
more difficult than that with which Le Verrier had to deal. When Le
Verrier’ had completed the determination of the motions of Uranus,
taking iuto account the action of Neptune, he considered the representa-
tion of the observations by theory highly satisfactory. But the out-
standing differences were far larger than those with which we are now
occupied.

In regard to the computations of the comet of short period mentioned
in the last report, we have nothing further to report at present, the work
having been suspended for a time on account of the transfer of Professor
Stone from the National Observatory to the Cincinnati observatory, and
the consequent absorption of his time in preparing for his new duties.

A small appropriation has also been made for a series of physiological
observations on the temperature of the human body under certain
abnormal conditions, by Prof. H. C. Wood, jr., and Dr. Horace Hare, of
Philadelphia. These observations are in progress, and it is thought the
results of the investigation will be ready for publication in the next
annual report. They relate especially to the subject of animal heat, the
mode of its production, and its relation to pathological and normal func-
tions. The first question to be investigated is whether ordinary fever
is due to an increased production or retention of heat. A series of
analytical experiments as to the amount of carbonic acid given off by
the animal during the normal and the febrile state, also the amount of
excretions from the kidneys, will be made, and a determination as to
whether the depression of temperature, caused by ammonia, section of
the spine, injuries, &c., is due to a diminished production or increased
loss of heat; also whether the paralytic fever observed in connection with
certain nerve sections is always caused by such sections, whether it is
induced by an increase in the production of heat, or by its retention ; and

finally, how the nervous system acts in the regulation of the calorific
function.
METEOROLOGY.

The Institution has continued the reduction and discussion of the
large amount of meteorological material which it collected during the
twenty years of its system of observations. The miscellaneous work by
the computers of the Institution during the year 1876, is as follows:

1. The temperature observations for the years 1871, ’72,’73, have been
,

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

reduced and partly tabulated, thus closing the series conducted by the
Institution relative to temperature.

2. The temperature and rain-fall observations made at a large num-
ber of stations in British North America have been tabulated to the
end of the year 1874. This was a special matter undertaken to facili-
tate and extend the rain-fall discussion.

3. A number of averages have been computed and the work continued
relative to the publication of a second edition of the memoir on the rain-
fall of the United States, which will embrace additional material.

4, Meteorological information has been furnished in many instances
to individuals making application therefor, they bearing the expense of
the clerical labor involved in the copying.

To complete the reduction and discussion of the system of meteorology
conducted by the Institution, there remain the observations relative to
the pressure of the atmosphere, and also those relative to moisture,
thunder-storms, and casual phenomena. These will be taken up during
1877.

TELEGRAPHIC ANNOUNCEMENT OF ASTRONOMICAL DISCOVERIES.

The arrangement which was concluded between the Smithsonian In-
stitution and the Atlantic cable companies in 1873, by which free tele-
graphic transmission of astronomical discoveries was granted between
Europe and America, has been continued during the past year.

The following is a list of the small planetoidal bodies discovered in
1876, the most of which discoveries were announced through this Insti-
tution :

A stellar outburst in the constellation of the “Swan” was observed
November 24, 1876, by Dr. Schmidt, at Athens ; a phenomenon similar
to the remarkable stellar outburst which occurred in the ‘“‘ Northern
Crown” in May, 1866, though not so brilliant, as it did not apparently
exceed the light of a star of the third magnitude at its greatest bright-
ness. At the close of the year it had dwindled to the lowest visible
magnitude.

26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
CORRESPONDENCE.

The correspondence of the Institution during the past year, especially
on account of the Centennial Exhibition, was very largely increased,
and has formed no inconsiderable part of the labors of the officers. The
usual number of inquiries have been made as to the name and character
of specimens of natural history, mineralogy, &c. The number of scien-
tific problems received for solution has not been diminished. Several
elaborate treatises have been submitted to the Institution for examina-
tion, purporting to be explanations of the theory of gravitation, and
other extended generalizations of natural phenomena. As the theory
of gravitation is a prominent subject of investigation by those who are
interested in scientific speculations, we would direct attention to a paper,
published in the appendix to this report, prepared for the Institution by
Mr. William B. Taylor, of Washington, giving a history, with comments,
of all the attempts which have been made since the discoveries of New-
ton to the present time to refer the phenomena of gravitation to some
other cause than that of action ata distance. This elaborate paper will
exhibit the difficulties of the problem which those who endeavor to solve
it have to contend with, as well as the entire failure of all the attempts
which have been made and the probable result of all that will be here-
after essayed in regard to it.

Among the subjects to which attention has been called by foreign cor-
respondents is that of the organization of a society, under the auspices
of the King of Belgium, at Brussels, for a thorough exploration of the
African continent, the final object of which being the suppression of
the slave-trade, the opening of the country to foreign commerce, and
its advancement in civilization. ‘To this enterprise the attention of all
the geographical societies of the world is called, and their co-operation
solicited. It is proposed to run lines of survey across the continent
from east to west and from north to south, establishing depots at inter-
vals for the accumulation of articles of commerce and the supply of the
explorers. This is truly an enterprise worthy of the present age, since
its object is to open, for the uses of civilized man, a portion of the earth
richly endowed with the means of the support and the enjoyment of
human life, now almost a waste, or only sparsely inhabited by barbarian
tribes. It is a work to which the attention of our educated citizens of
pure African descent should be directed, as opening a field of unpar-
alleled usefulness in the way of advancing the civilization of the world,
and it is one to which they are especially adapted, since, in a letter from
Professor Edw. D. Blyden, of Liberia College, published in the appen-
dix to the Smithsonian Report for 1870, it is shown that only individu-
als of pure African blood are fully fitted for withstanding the peculiar

influence of the climate.
EXCHANGES.

The operations of this part of the general system of labor of the Insti-
tution have assumed a magnitude during the past year far greater than
REPORT OF .THE SECRETARY. 25

that of any previous year since its first adoption. This has arisen from
the fact that we have presented to foreign libraries, especially those
of Australia and New Zealand, a large number of sets of the publications
of the Institution, and also those of the publications of the Government
entrusted to the Institution for distribution.

During the past year 4,853 packages, each containing ecvanal articles,
have been received from anna for distribution to institutions and indi-
viduals in this country.

Three hundred and twenty-three boxes, averaging 7 cubic feet each,
with a total weight of 80,000 pounds, were sent abroad by the Institu-
tion during the year. The total number of separate parcels contained
in these boxes was about 13,000.

As an evidence of the high estimation in which this branch of the
operations of the Institution is regarded, as well as to give proper
credit to the parties who have transmitted free of cost the packages of
the Institution, we reprint, as usual, the following list of their names:

Cunard Steamship Company. | North German Lloyd Steamship
Anchor Steamship Company. | Company.
Pacific Mail Steamship Company. | Hamburg American Packet Com-
Panama Railroad. Company. | pany.
Pacific Steam Navigation Compa- French Transatlantic Company.
TER im «6! | North Baltic Lloyd Steamship
New York and Mexico Steamship Company.
Company. | Inman Steamship Company.
New York and Brazil Steamship
Company. |

The special thanks of the Institution are again tendered to the above-
mentioned companies for their enlightened liberality.

We may also mention as an evidence of the high appreciation of the
character of the Smithsonian exchanges that the packages bearing the
marks of the Institution are admitted free of duty and without exam-
ination into all foreign ports.

The following are the principal foreign agencies of reception and dis-
tribution of the Smithsonian exchanges :

London, William Wesley, 28 Essex street, Strand.

Paris, G. Bossange, 16 Rue du 4 Septembre.

Leipsiec, Dr. Felix Fliigel, 49 Sidonien Strasse.

To facilitate the business of the exchanges, the following rules have
been adopted :

1. Every package, without exception, must be enveloped in strong
paper, and secured so as to bear separate transportation by express or
otherwise.

2. The address of the Institution or individual, for whom the package
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

is intended, must be written legibly on the cover, and the name of the
sender on one corner of the same.

3. No single package must exceed half of a cubie foot in bulk.

3. A detailed list of addresses of all the parcels sent, with their con-
tents, must accompany them.

5. No letter or other communication can be allowed in the parcel,
excepting such as relates exclusively to the contents of the package.

6. All packages must be delivered in Washington free of freight and
other expenses.

7. Every parcel should contain a blank acknowledgment, to be signed
and returned, either through the agent of the Institution, or, what is
still better, through the mail, to the sender.

Should returns be desired for what is sent, the fact should be ex-
plicitly stated on the list of the contents of the package. Much disap-
pointment is frequently expressed at the absence of any return in kind
for transmissions; but unless these are specifically asked for, they will
fail in many instances to be made. It will facilitate the labors of the
Institution very much if the number corresponding to the several ad-
dresses in the Smithsonian printed catalogue be marked on the face
of each parcel; and for this purpose a copy of the catalogue will be
forwarded to all who apply for it.

Specimens of natural history will not be received for transmission
unless with a previous understanding as to their character and bulk.

8. Unless all these conditions are complied with, the parcels will not
be forwarded from the Institution; and, on the failure to comply with
the first and second conditions, will be returned to the sender for cor-
rection.

Exchange of Government documents.—In the last report a full account
was given of the system adopted for carrying out the law relative to
the exchange of the official publications of United States Government
for those of foreign nations. In accordance with this system, during
the past year 120 boxes of documents were forwarded, the following
being a list of the distribution:

30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The expense of boxing, packing, transporting, and paying of agents —
in connection with the transmission of these sets of. Government doca-
ments, amounting to $857.50, was advanced by the Institution, with the
expectation that it would be repaid from an appropriation for the
Library of Congress; but when the account was presented we were in-
formed that, in consequence cf the reduction of the appropriations at
the last session of Congress, there were no funds available for the pur-
pose. We have, therefore, requested the Library Committee of Congress
to procure the insertion of an item in the deficiency bill to re-imburse
the Institution for the amount advanced, and also to defray the cost of
the necessary expenses of the system of exchange for the ensuing six

months.
LIBRARY.

The library of the Institution, as has been stated in previous reports,
has been placed on deposit in the Library of Congress under the direction
of Mr. A. R. Spofford, librarian.

The following is a statement of the books, maps and charts received
by the Smithsonian Institution in 1876 and transferred to the Capitol:

Congress. Much use is made of the books of the Institution which are
in the Library of Congress as well as those of the latter library by the
collaborators of the Institution.

Among the principal donations received in 1876 are the following:

ETHNOLOGY.

The Institution during the past year has, as usual, given special at-
tention to ethnology, and has directed investigations to be made in
all cases where information has been received of the existence of
mounds, shell-heaps, &c. The subject, however, has received a special
impetus through the Centennial appropriation of Congress, circulars
having been distributed to the correspondents of the Institution re-
questing aid in collecting specimens and in giving information as to
the existence of particular collections. By this means and through the
agency of the United States Indian Bureau a very large addition has
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Se,

been made to the collection of ancient implements as well as to that of
those used by Indians of the present day. It was stated in the last
report that the services of Charles Rau, a well known ethnologist, had
been engaged to classify and arrange the collection in the National
Museum and to prepare a descriptive catalogue for publication. This
work he has accomplished in connection with the Centennial Exhibi-
tion, and although the catalogue is not entirely exhaustive it will
serve to show what ample material has been obtained by the Smithso-
nian Institution for the study of North American archeology. The fol-
lowing is an account of the work in question:

In the introduction the author speaks of the system adopted by him
in arranging the Smithsonian collections illustrative of North American
archeology and ethnology. The archeological series comprises objects
supposed to belong to times antecedent to the European occupation,
and which, therefore, are thought to exhibit aboriginal art unmodified
by contact with the whites. These relics, consisting of chipped and
ground stone, of copper, bone, horn, shell, clay, and, to a small extent,
of wood, were found in mounds and other burial-places of early date,
in eaves and in the shell-heaps met with along the coasts of North
America. The second, or more strictly ethnological, series, a descrip-
tion of which is not attempted in the present volume, consists of arti-
cles obtained from existing native tribes by private explorations, as well
as by expeditions undertaken by order of the United States Govern-
ment, and contains almost every object tending to illustrate the do-
mestic life, hunting, fishing, game, warfare, navigation, traveling by
land—in short, every phase of the existence of these tribes that can be
represented by tangible tokens. The uses of these ethnological speci-
mens are in most cases well known, a statement which cannot be made
in reference to the objects constituting the archeological series, for
many of the latter leave a wide scope for conjecture as to the manner
in which they were employed by their makers. These doubts extend
even to certain types hitherto thought to be well recognized. Thus,
many of the so-called arrow and spear heads were not what their names
imply, but knives used in connection with short wooden handles. Such
cutting-tools have been obtained by Major J. W. Powell among the

_ Pai-utes, and Mr. Paul Schumacher found corresponding implements in
graves of Southern California.

The introduction closes with reference to the other valuable collec-
tions of the National Museum which illustrate the past or present con-
dition of man in Central and South America, in Asia, Europe, and the
other parts of the world.

The first division treats of the most numerous class of relics, namely,

“those of stone, which are fashioned either by the process of chipping,
grinding, or polishing. The first category embraces rude pieces, flakes
and cores as well as the more carefully wrought objects, such as arrow
and spear heads, perforators, scrapers, cutting and sawing tools, dag-

83
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ger-shaped implements, large implements supposed to have been used
in digging the ground, and, lastly, wedge or celt-shaped tools or
weapons. The ground and polished specimens, more defined in form,
comprise wedges or celts, chisels, gouges, adzes, and grooved axes, ham-

mers, drilled ceremonial weapons, cutting-tools, scraper and spade-like
implements, pendants and sinkers, discoidal stones and kindred objects,
pierced tablets and boat-shaped articles, stones used in grinding and
polishing, vessels, mortars, pestles, tubes, pipes, ornaments, and sculp-
tures.

The objects of copper are described under the following heads. They
are either weapons and tools, or ornaments, and have been produced,
as it would appear, by hammering pieces of native copper into the re-
quired shapes.

The third division embraces the specimens of bone and horn, consist-
ing of perforators, harpoon-heads, fish-hooks, cups, whistles, drilled
teeth, &e.

Under the fourth head are enumerated the various objects made of
shells. They are either utensils and tools, such as drinking-cups,
spoons, fish-hooks, celts, &c., or ornaments, comprising various kinds of
gorgets, pendants, and pends:

In the fifth division, which treats of ceramic fabrics, he vessels ob-
tained from mounds of the United States as well as the more elaborate
specimens of Mexican fictile art, are described and figured.

Under the sixth head the wooden objects of early date are enumer-
ated. Their number is not very considerable, owing to the perishable
character of wood.

In the first appendix the aboriginal methods of hafting stone and bone
implements are described and illustrated by eighteen drawings. The
second appendix shows the system adopted in classifying the Smithso-
nian collection, illustrative of North American ethnology.

The implements and samples of workmanship which the Institution
has collected furnish a knowledge of the condition of the arts among
the primitive people who inhabited this continent. There is, however,
another class of ethnological information which cannot be derived from
such objects. We allude to the manners and customs of the people, the
ceremonies they observe, the myths they transmit, and the religious
systems they have adopted. As a general rule it may be assumed that
for any usage or ceremony found among them for which no reason can
be given there was a corresponding usage in ancient times which had a
direct relation to the condition of the people at that time. Hence in
order to reconstruct the past history of the different races of men it is
of great importance to discover the survivals of the past in present
usages. The especial attention therefore of those who have an oppor-
tunity of studying those tribes of Indians which have come least under
the influence of civilized man has been directed to obtaining accurate
information as to the points we have above enumerated.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 355

Indian vocabularies.—For a number of years the Institution has been
collecting, as a part of its work in the line of ethnology, Indian vocabnu-
laries, and of these the number amounts to 670. They were placed in
the charge of J. H. Trumbull, LLD., of Hartford, Conn., for critical
examination and arrangement forthe press. It was the intention of the
Institution to publish these vocabularies as a part of the volumes of
the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge, and also in a separate
form for more general distribution to philologists actually engaged in
the comparative study of languages of savage tribes. An offer, how-
ever, was made by Maj. J. W. Powell, who had also collected a series of
Indian vocabularies, to adopt those of the Institution, and to publish
the whole in connection with his researches under Government in re-
gard to the ethnology of the Indian tribes inhabiting the country
watered by the tributaries of the Great Colorado of the West. In ac-
cordance with the general policy of the Institution in not expending its
funds on anything which can be as well done by other means, the prop-
osition of Major Powell was accepted, the only conditions exacted on
which the transfer was made being that full credit should be given in
the publication to the name of Smithson for collecting and arranging
the articles, and also that extra copies be furnished the Institution for
liberal distribution.

In connection with these vocabularies the Institution has also trans-
ferred to Major Powell, for publication, a grammar of the Ponka lan-
guage, by Rev. J. Owen Dorsey, of Maryland, who resided for several
years aS a missionary among the Ponka Indians.

The Institution has also transferred to Dr. F. V. Hayden for publica-
tion, in connection with his explorations, the following articles, giving
an account of the result of ethnological explorations undertaken under
the auspices of the Institution:

‘*¢ Researches in the Kj6kkenméddings and graves of a former popula-
tion of the coast of Oregon, the Santa Barbara Islands, and the adja-
cent mainland.” By Paul Schumacher.*

“The Twana Indians of the Kokomish reservation in Washington
Territory.” By Rey. M. Eells.*

These will also be published with due acknowledgment to the In-.
stitution, and extra copies furnished for distribution to its ethnelogical
correspondents.

New edition of ethnological instructions—In March, 1861, the Smith-
sonian Institution published a paper entitled ‘ Instructions for Research
relative to the Ethnology and Philology of America,” prepared by Dr.
George Gibbs, an octavo pamphlet of 51 pages divided into two parts,
the first relating to ethnology, the second to philology. Under the first
head Dr. Gibbs treated of the facts that should be observed and the
the Territories. Vol. III, No.1. April, 1877.

material collected, relating to crania, specimens of art, &c., names of
tribes, geographical position, number, physical constitution, picture-
writing, dress, food, dwellings, arts, trade, religion, government, social
life, war, medicines, literature, calendar, and astronomy, history, and
antiquities. Under the head of philology he gave a brief account of
some of the peculiarities of the Indian languages, with general direc-
tions for the best methods of collecting certain words, a simple and
practical alphabet, and a comparative vocabulary in English, Spanish,
French, and Latin. This vocabulary contains 211 words. The whole was
followed by an Appendix A, “‘ Physical Character of the Indian Races,”
with a tabulated statement on particulars of inquiry, and also an Appefi-
dix B, relative to ‘* Numeral Systems.”

This paper has been distributed widely among the missionaries, Indian
agents, travelers, and local collectors in ethnology, and has served a val-
uable purpose, resulting in the collection by various persons of the large
number of vocabularies previously mentioned, and ‘vhich comprise
nearly all, the languages and dialects of the Indian tribes of the
United States, and many in British America and Mexico. It served
also to direct inquiry in the several branches of ethnography, resulting
in the collection of many valuable notes and minor papers on this subject
and many articles illustrating the industries, arts, means of subsistence,
&c., among the Indian tribes. It has stimulated investigation through-
out the country, giving direction to inquiry, while the results have abun-
dantly proved the value of the instructions and the wisdom of their pub-
lication.

The demand for this work has been such that it is deemed important
to publish a new edition of it, more comprehensive in plan and more
elaborate in detail.

First. It is found necessary to enlarge the alphabet so as to include a
wider range of sounds which have been discovered in the North Ameri-
can languages.

Second. It is necessary to enlarge the vocabulary so as to modify it
somewhat as experience has dictated, and that new words may be col-
lected.

Third. It is desirable that many simple sentences should be given, so
chosen as to bring out the more important characteristics of grammatic
structure.

This work, which will form a manual of ethnography, has been
undertaken in behalf of the Institution by Prof. J. W. Powell, aided
by several eminent ethnologists and philologists, and is well under way.

In this connection I may mention that John Howard Payne, author
of “ Home, Sweet Home,” in 1848 presented to the Institution for pub-
lication a large amount of manuscript giving an account of the manners,
customs, myths, and religion of the Cherokee Nation previous to its
removal from Georgia. He was shortly afterward re-appointed Ameri-

can consul at Tripoli, on the occasion of which he withdrew the manu-
script for revision and preparation for the press. He took it with him
to his distant post of duty, with the intention of returning it to the
Institution, but his sudden death prevented the realization of this inten-
tion. We have made inquiry in regard to this manuscript, but have
been unable to obtain any information as to what has become of it.

An account of the large additions to the department of ethnology dur-
ing the last year will be found in the report on the Museum.

MISCELLANEOUS.

‘The Institution, as in former years, has been in harmonious co-opera-
tion with the Department of Agriculture, the Army Medical Museum,
and the Corcoran Art Gallery. With the first it has deposited plants
and other articles relating to agriculture; to the second it has trans-
ferred a large number of articles pertaining to comparative anatomy
and materia medica, and has received in return ethnological specimens;
in the third, the Corcoran Art Gallery, it has deposited a number of en-
gravings.

Chemical Laboratory.—During a part of the past year the laboratory of
the Institution has been in charge of Dr. Oscar Loew, the chemist and
mineralogist of the Wheeler Survey, during which time, besides analyzing
various mineral waters and other substances collected by that expedi-
tion, he has made a series of analyses of minerals for the Institution.

Photography.—tn the photographic laboratory, under the direction of
ir. T. W. Smillie, a large number of photographs have been made of
ethnological and natural-history specimens. The Institution has con-
tinued during the past year the collection of photographic likenesses of
cultivators of science in all parts of the world, the whole number re-
ceived up to this time being over twelve hundred.

Light-house duty—I have been a member of the Light-House Board
since its organization, and during this time have discharged the duty of
chairman of thecommittee on experiments. To the discharge of the duties
connected with this service I usually devote one day in the week, and the
greater portion of my summer vacation to light-house investigations. A
considerable portion, however, of the vacation last year was expended
in acting as one of the board of centennial judges. On this account the

researches on sound as applied to fog-signals have been deferred until
another season.

Fish Commission.—The investigation in regard to food-fishes and the
methods of their propagation, for which an appropriation for several
years has been annually made by Congress, has been continued under
the direction of Professor Baird. This work was commenced in 1872,
and has been prosecuted with satisfactory results to the present time.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The National Museum was established by the Government in 1842, at
which time it consisted principally of specimens collected by the Wilkes
exploring expedition. It was transferred from the Patent Office to the
care of the Smithsonian Institution in 1858, where it has been enlarged
by all the collections made by exploring and surveying parties of the
several bureaus of the War, Navy, Treasury, and Interior Departments,
and those of the Smithsonian Institution. At first $4,000 only was an-
nually allowed by Congress for the care and exhibition of the specimens.
In 1871 the appropriation for this purpose was increased to $10,000, in
1872 to $15,000, and for the last two years to $20,000. Nothing, how-
ever, has been allowed for the rent of the building, which was erected
exclusively out of the income from the bequest of Smithson.

The following report from Professor Spencer F. Baird, assistant sec-
retary, gives an account of the additions to the museum and the various
operations connected with it during the year 1876:

REPORT OF PROF. SPENCER F. BAIRD ON THE ADDITIONS, &C., TO THE
MUSEUM IN 1876.

Increase of the Museum.—At no period in the history of the National
Museum, from the time when it was organized to the present, has the
increase been so great as during the year 1876. A sudden and abrupt
augmentation began in 1875, reaching its culmination in 1876. In the
absence of funds for the purchase of collections, the ordinary means of
increase have been derived, first, from the contributions of Smithsonian
correspondents, either spontaneous, or invited with a view of securing
material for some particular research ; second, from the specimens col-
lected by the various Government surveys and exploring expeditions and
transferred to the Smithsonian building in accordance with the law of Con-
gress; and, third, by the exchange of specimens with private individu-
als or public establishments at home and abroad.

During the two years just past the most important means of increase
has been the United States International or Centennial Exhibition of
1876, which has just passed into history as the most extensive and suc-
cessful of world’s exhibitions of natural products and general industries.

In addition, however, to the sources of increase to the Museum
during the years 1875 and 1876, mentioned above, still another presented
itself of perhaps even greater productiveness, viz, acquisitions from
foreign exhibits. With scarcely an exception, the best and most im-
portant of these were presented to the United States at the close
of the exhibition, embracing, as they did, many complete series
of objects, illustrating the geology, metallurgy, the ethnology, and the
general resources of all nations. - Of about forty governments and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

colonies, the choicest of the exhibits of thirty-four were presented to
the Smithsonian Institution for the National Museum, the remainder
either having nothing to give or being restricted in the disposal of
their articles.

It was, however, not from foreign commissions alone that collections
were received by the Institution. Several entire State exhibits, and
many belonging to private parties were also added to the general in-
crease. Nevada, Montana, and Utah presented the whole of their
mineral exhibits, while partial collections were received from several
other States and Territories.

Of the general collections received during the year, the most note-
worthy are the zoélogical specimens brought together by Lieut. George
M. Wheeler, during his recent survey, and turned over by him to the
museum in accordance with the law of Congress.

Engineer William A. Mintzer, of the United States Navy, also con-
tributed a number of packages, containing collections of natural history
and ethnology from Arctic America, collected by him while engaged in
mining isinglass on Admiralty Island, north of Hudson’s Straits.

The general ethnological collections obtained during the year (prin-
cipally as the result of expenditure from the centennial fund of the
Indian Bureau) are of very great extent. Among the most impor-
tant may be mentioned those of Mr. James G. Swan, from Vancouver
Island, Alaska, and Washington Territory, illustrating the habits of the
highly ingenious Northwestern Indians, the more conspicuous of these
being the front of an Indian house, a number of carved wooden columns
for ornamental purposes, some of them 30 feet long and 8 wide, carved
from a single log and, properly ornamented, and a dug-out canoe, 60 feet
feet long and eight wide.

Mr. Paul Schumacher, in continuing his archeological labors on the
south coast of California, made many important acquisitions, adding
materially to the variety he had previously gathered. Some additional
objects of interest were also received from Rey. Stephen Bowers, of
Santa Barbara. Dr. W. W. Hays, of San Luis Obispo, formerly con-
~ nected with the Smithsonian Institution, also presented a large number
ef objects, while additional collections were also received from Mr. Ste-
phen Powers, principally’ of illustrations of the life eos customs of the
Indians of Nevada and California.

The parties sent out by Major Powell, at the request of the Indian
Bureau, to make collections illustrative of the Indians of New Mexico,
especially of the Moquis, obtained an extensive collection, including
pottery both ancient and recent, stone implements, dresses, We.

One of the most interesting and important additions to the ethnolog-
ical collection consisted of carvings of bone and stone implements, con-
tributed by Mr. Lucien M. Turner, United States signal observer at
Saint Michael’s, on Norton’s Sound, south of Behring’s Straits. This
series, in the number of pieces and variety of shape, the character of
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the ornaments, &c., is one of the most striking of its kind ever con-
tributed to the museum.

Additional collections of objects were also received from Capt. A. W.
Corliss, United States Army, stationed at Tucson.

Not less interesting and important were the archeological collections
received from Nicaragua. Dr. Earl Flint, of Granada, furnished many
additional specimens to his previous transmissions.

To Dr. J. F. Bransford, United States Navy, is due the most impor-
tant acquisition ever made from Central America, in the form of avery
large number of objects exhumed from Indian graves on the island
of Omotepec, in Lake Nicaragua. These were especially interesting as
being found between successive sheets of volcanic eruptions, thus giving
a comparative chronology to the objects.

A series of objects illustrative of the Ainos, or hairy men of Jesso,
furnished by Mr. B.S, Lyman, are of signal interest.

The most important contributions among the mammalia consisted of
collections of fur-seals and sea-lions from the Alaska Commercial Com-
pany, and a series of eight skins of sea-lions of the California coast (Za-
lophus gillespii) and presented by Capt. J. G. Baker, of the United States
revenue marine.

No very large collections of birds were received during the year, with
the exception of those from Lieutenant Wheeler’s party, although the
specimens furnished by Engineer Mintzer from Greenland, by Dr. Her-
ing from Surinam and elsewhere, are noteworthy.

Numerous reptiles in small lots were brought in from various sources. ©
Of fishes, the acquisitions were numerous, consisting mainly of transmis-
sions by agents of the United States Fish Commission. As heretofore,
Mr. Vinal N. Edwards, of Wood’s Hele, made many important contri-
butions, among which were some fifteen species additional to the known
fauna of that locality, which for many years has been the chief station
of the Fish Commission.

Mr. Thomas J. Moore, curator of the free public library of the city of
Liverpool, transmitted a number of species of English fishes packed in
ice for the purpose of having casts made and added to the collections of
the Institution. These were consigned first to Mr. E. G. Blackford, of
Fulton market, who repacked them in ice and shipped them to Washing-
ton. Ilor this, as well as for a continuation of the services of this
gentleman in the prompt transmission of rare fishes, the Institution is
under great obligations. A special service rendered by him was the
transmission, day by day, to the Fish Commission exhibit at the Cen-
tennial of all the varieties of fresh fish as they made their appearance
in the New York market. Their preservation in large refrigerators,
erected at his suggestion by Messrs. Allegretti and Banta, constituted
a great source of attraction to the Centennial visitor.

The exhibit made of the fisheries of the United States derived a great;
deal of its value from the co-operation and contribution of various
REPURT OF THE SECRETARY. 41

parties who fully appreciated the importance of making a satisfactory
competitive display in view of the anticipated rivalry of foreign govern-
ments. Among these, acknowledgment is especially due to Messrs.
Bradford & Anthony, of Boston, for undertaking to bring together the
fullest series of objects used by the American angler ; to Messrs. A. R.
Crittenden & Co., of Middletown, Conn., who in like manner prepared the
collection of boat-fittings, fisherman’s equipments, clothing, &c.; to the
‘American Net and Twine Company, of Boston and New York, which
supplied samples of nets of all kinds, models of pounds and fishing-boats,
and furnished also miles of netting to serve as ornamental drapery to
the building. Mr. J. H. Nichols, of Syracuse, and Mr. Thaddeus Nerris,
of Philadelphia, also supplied from their private collections a number
of angler’s equipments.

Here, as in the case of other objects, space does not permit more ex-
tended mention; but the detailed enumeration will be found in the list
of donations.

The additions to the collections of minerals were enormously large,
the principal and most important being a series of ores of the precious
metals collected in California, Oregon, Nevada, Utah, Idaho, and else-
where, by Mr. Thomas Donaldson, and representing a money value far
greater than its actual cost, in view of the donation of the specimens
by the owners and the agents of various mines.

The collections made by Professor Blake on Lake Superior, by Mr. G.
C. Brodhead in Missouri and elsewhere, by Mr. Maury in West Virginia,
and by other parties, were also noteworthy. By far the most valuable
direct donation, however, was that of the collection of ores and minerals
of Nevada collected by the Stafe Centennial board and exhibited with
the Smithsonian display. These, with all the cases in which the speci-
mens were exhibited, were presented to the National Museum by the
authority of the legislature of Nevada, the same disposition having
been made of the very valuable collections of Montana and Utah.
Gen. J. H. Wilder, of Chattanooga, presented a large number of speci-
mens from Tennessee. Other series of more or less note will be found
detailed in the list of donations.

The present of three large boxes filled with choice minerals of Japan
by the government of that country is also a noteworthy addition.

It will be seen from the preceding enumeration that all parts of
North America are represented in the accessions of 1875 and 1876, and
So uniformly indeed that no one region can be indicated as more worthy
of notice than another.

From Central and South America have been received collections in
ethnology and zodlogy; from the South Pacific a general collection in
natural history ; from Japan collections in ethnology and mineralogy.
Apart from the Centennial donations comparatively little has been sent
in from Europe, a few specimens of birds and ethnological objects rep-
resenting the series. With the acquisitions made at Philadelphia,
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

however, no part of the world is really unrepresented, as shown by the
enumeration of foreign commissions which presented either the whole
or a considerable portion of the objects they exhibited from the animal,
vegetable, and mineral kingdoms, or as illustrating their ethnology or
industries.

It is quite impossible to give, in the limited pages allotted to the
present report, anything like a complete statement of the objects thus
added to the treasures of the National Museum from the five principal
sources thus mentioned. In the Appendix, however, will be found a
general statement of the more important objects presented by foreign
commissions, arranged alphabetically by countries, the remaining addi-
tions being given under an alphabetical list of donors. The catalogue
of the display made by the Smithsonian Institution and Fish Commis-
sion at the Centennial, for the publication of which it is hoped Congress
will shortly make provision, will give a minute enumeration of all
objects obtained on that occasion.

Work done in the Museum and at Philadelphia.z—As might have been
expected, the numerous additions to the collections, resulting from the
various donations above referred to, required a corresponding increase
of the personnel of the Museum, and a very large force was temporarily
employed in receiving and unpacking collections, in preparing them
properly for exhibition, in mounting them for suitable display, in cat-
aloguing, entering, and labeling them, in packing for shipment to Phil-
adelphia, in unpacking and arranging there, in caring for them during
the exhibition, in repacking and shipping to Washington, and in dis-
posing of them properly at the end of théir journey. The funds for this
additional service were derived from the special appropriation made
by Congress for the purpose. ‘To facilitate the work, several divisions
were organized; that of ethnology, under the charge of Dr. Charles

tau, assisted by Dr. Edward Foreman and Mr. Frank H. Cushing;
the mineral department, under Prof. William P. Blake, assisted by Mr.
Thomas Donaldson; the animal and fisheries divisions were in charge
of Mr. G. Brown Goode, assisted by Mr. T. H. Bean and Mr. H. C.
Chester.

A series of plaster casts of the fishes, reptiles, and cetaceans of North
America was prepared and painted to represent the colors of the living
animal. The preparation of the skeletons of whales and other animals
of economical interest was done partly at the establishment of Henry
A’. Ward at Rochester , and partly at the Institution.

The aggregate of the entries of specimens in 1876 amounted to 23,675,
showing a very large increase over the entries of 1875 (12,578) and still
more over those of 1874, (10,332.)

An accompanying report upon the operations of the Smithsonian In-
stitution, as connected with the centennial display, will give the necessary
details in regard to the operations at Philadelphia during the summer,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

although it may be stated here, in brief, that while the mounting of the
specimens, or arranging them in a suitable form for exhibition, was ear-
ried on during the whole of the period, the actual packing up and box-
ing of the specimens began in March, and their shipment in April.
Twenty-one car-loads of specimens were forwarded from the Smithsonian
Institution, and these were unpacked and put in place with such rapidity,
that by the 10th of May, at the opening of the exhibition, comparatively
little remained to be done, the whole labor being completed within the
subsequent few weeks.

On the 10th of November the Sait: of packing the specimens for their
return to Washington was commenced, but was soon arrested by an order
of the President directing everything to remain as it was, pending the
action of Congress in regard to the erection of a,suitable building for
the Government exhibit, as more fully detailed in the accompanying
report. The interval, however, was made use of in transferring the
donations made to the United States by foreign governments and Ameri-
can States and individuals from their previous place of exhibition to
the Government building. As soon as the embargo as to packing was
removed, these collections, with others constituting fhe summer’s exhibit,
were boxed and held in readiness for the anticipated order of the Presi-
dent for their transfer to Washington.

In addition to the twenty-one car-loads of objects meaed to Philadel-
phia from Washington, a large portion of the exhibit of the Smith-
sonian Institution, arriving from other directions was put in place.
Almost the whole of the mineral display was in this category, only one
load having gone from Washington.

The collections transferred to Washington after the close of the Ex-
hibition were more than thrice the bulk of those that were taken thence
to Philadelphia in the spring, the entire shipment returned occupied
forty-two cars, representing approximately an aggregate of 812,000
pounds.

This may be a proper occasion to acknowledge the very great liberal-
ity of the railroad companies in regard to the collections in charge of the
Smithsonian Institution, and without which the funds at its command
would have been inadequate to meet the expense of transportation. By
an agreement between the railroad companies and Captain John F.
Rodgers, the officer in charge of transportation to and from Phila-
delphia of the Government collection, full rates were to be paid
one way; but all objects thus transferred were to be brought back
free of charge. Thanks, however, to the liberality of the Phila-
delphia, Wilmington and Baltimore, the Baltimore and Potomac, and
the Pennsylvania Railroad Companies, no charge whatever was made on
the twenty-one car-loads taken to Philadelphia in the spring; and the
same companies agreed, without inquiring into the nature of the con-
tents, to bring back to Washington the same number of cars free of
expense—additional ear-loads to be paid for at the usual rates. It was
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

under these conditions that the liberality of the Philadelphia, Wilming-
ton and Baltimore Railroad, in furnishing, as far as they could be used,
hay-cars of extra size, was of so much importance, as it enabled us to
pack in a portion of the cars at least 50 per cent. more than in ordinary
freight-cars. The remissions of the freights to Philadelphia from vari-
ous points are due largely to the efforts of Mr. John 8. Wilson, of the
Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore Railroad Company, acting
under the authority of Mr. Isaac Hinckley, president of the road, and
_ to those of Mr. Kingston, of the Pennsylvania Railroad.

Scientific investigation of collections.—In view of the constant labor re-
quired in receiving the collections and putting them in proper form for
the Philadelphia exhibition, it was impossible to devote much effort to
the critical investigation of the collections and their use as material for
scientific purposes, although a number of the specimens were placed in
the hands of correspondents and collaborators for careful examination,
among which are the following:

Mr. Robt. Ridgway, in charge of the department of mounted animals,
has continued his investigation of the birds in the National Museum, and
has arranged and labeled the entire American collection, involving the
handling of over 30,000 specimens.

Mr. George N. Lawrence has examined certain obscure species of the
ornithological collection, new to science.

The Rodentia have been investigated by Dr. Elliott Coues, who has
prepared therefrom material for an elaborate monograph to be published
in Professor Hayden’s series of reports. Several new species have re-
warded his labors. A preliminary report has lately been made by him
of the shrews, which will form the subject of a second work by the same
author.

Prof. Edward Cope has received various collections of reptiles from
the Institution, and has submitted them to careful examination.

Dr. Thomas H. Streets, surgeon United States Navy, has been en-
gaged during the year in investigating the collection of vertebrates and
other animals obtained by him during a recent United States survey of
the South Pacific and the Gulf of California made by the United States
ships Portsmouth and Narragansett. He has discovered several new
species, an account of which, with his other notes, will be published in
the Bulletins of the National Museum.

Professor Gill has continued his labors upon the general and sys-
tematic arrangement of the mammals and fishes.

The ethnological collection has also been the subject of considerable
inquiry. Professor O. T. Mason, of Washington, has undertaken a
memoir upon a remarkable collection of stone implements from Porto

tico, presented to the National Museum by the late Mr. George Latimer.
This will be fully illustrated and form part of the report of the Institu-
tion for 1876.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

Dr. Rau has prepared a work on the American stone age, to serve as
a guide to the archeological exhibit of the United States, and which
has been published by the Institution.

Dr. James Lewis has completed, during the year, his investigation of
the fresh-water and land shells of the United States belonging to the
Museum, and has carefully identified and labeled the species. A series
was reserved by him for the Museum and the duplicates made up into
sets for distribution. ‘

Dr. Edward Foreman has also thoroughly identified the vegetable
substances used by the American Indians as food, medicine, narcotics, °
paints, &c., and has made up numerous sets for distribution to ethno-
logical establishments.

Distribution of duplicate specimens—The same reasons which pre-
vented the usual effort in regard to researches among the collections
has more or less interfered with the distribution of duplicates during
the year; but as the amount of material available for the purpose has
been greatly increased as a result of the Centennial collections, it is
hoped that the coming year will permit an unusual amount of effort in
this direction.

A considerable number, however, of zoological, mineralogical and
ethnological specimens, either singly or in sets, have been sent off as
direct donations or exchanges. Their aggregate, including that for
1875, will be found in the usual table of the appendix.

Present condition of the Musewm.—The great enlargement of the
Museum has commensurately expanded its means for scientific and prac-
tical instruction. In many departments it may claim very great emi-
nence, entitling it, on the whole, to rank with the largest Huropean
collections, while in some respects, especially as regards the ethnology,
mineralogy, and zoology of North America, it may fairly be said to
occupy the very first place among museums of the world. The immense
mass of duplicates now in its charge also constitutes so much material
for increasing the present number of species, and when proper facilities
are afforded for unpacking and arranging its reserve series, great addi-
tions can be made by a suitable system of exchanges. At present, how-
ever, everything looking toward such final arrangements is contingent
upon provision by Congress in the way of increased accommodations,
since the present available space is entirely inadequate to the purpose.

The Museum portion of the Smithsonian edifice consists of two rooms
of about 10,000 feet area each, with a connecting range and gallery of
about 5,000 feet. The specimens in cases are at present very much
crowded, while very many others are in boxes, occupying the passages
and intermediate spaces. The basement of the Institution, nearly 400
feet long, is a series of store-rooms, for the reception of portions of the
collection not yet exhibited in the upper halls, and thus without benefit
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY:

to the general public. Among these objects are very many skeletons,
beautifully prepared by Professor Ward, some 40,000 jars of alcoholic
specimens, together with several hundred large copper tanks, likewise
filled ; over 50,000 skins of birds, of which at least 15,000 should be
mounted and placed in the general collection ; several thousand skins
of mammals; large numbers of fossil vertebrates, minerals, ethnological
objects, &e.; these, for the most part, not duplicates, but simply speci-
mens for which there is no room elsewhere.

An estimate of 25,000 square feet, or a space eaual to that of the
upper halls, is by no means extravagant for the proper display of the |
specimens thus excluded. Anticipating the necessity of increased ac-
commodations for the Centennial collections and accessions, the Smith-
sonian Institution, in 1875, made application to Congress for the use of
the Armory building in the square between 6th and 7th Streets, an edi-
fice 100 feet by 50, having four floors. This it was supposed would be
adequate, at the close of the Centennial, for the reception and exhibition
of at least the fishery exhibit and that of economical mineralogy. So
great, however, was the surplus of Centennial material to be provided
for that the building is now filled with boxed specimens, occupying for
the most part the entire space from floor to ceiling of each room. The
building is not fire-proof, and although the specimens in it represent some
of the most valuable and important of the series, there is nothing to pre-
vent their destruction by fire. or injury from damp, vermin, or other
causes, a result which would constitute an irreparable loss.

As the four floors of the Armory referred to present 20,000 feet of
area, an estimate of 50,000 feet for the proper display of the specimens
now stored in them cannot be considered extravagant, thus making the
entire additional space required, 75,000 square feet. Only one-fourth of
the specimens in charge of the Institution are at present on exhibition,
the remainder being entirely withdrawn from public inspection, so that
the necessity for prompt effort to secure the proper accommodations will
be readily nuderstood.

There can be no question as to the scientific and industrial value of the
specimens thus added to the national collections, as they consist, not of
the ordinary objects of natural history alone, but of those which show
the natural and industrial resources of the country, and constitute, in
very great part, that material which to the American manufacturer and
producer is of the utmost value as constituting the objects of their
study. Indeed, their acquisition by the United States tends to render
the benefits of the international exhibition permanent to a great de-
gree; it is, therefore, of importance that, while the lessons of the ex-
hibition are still fresh in mind these objects should be exhibited and at-
tention invited to them. Numerous applications have already been made
for permission to make a study of the objects, which, on account of the
impossibility of furnishing space for unpacking them, for the most part
have been refused. The great number of duplicates, too, should be
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 47

distributed as speedily as possible to the various points throughout the
country requiring them. Of course, this cannot be done under present
circumstances.

Nature of increased accommodations required.-—In view of the fact that
the collections for which provision is needed represent a bulk of at least
three times the present capacity of. the Smithsonian building, it is evi-
dent that to accommodate these, and to make reasonable provision
for probable increase in the future, a building of great magnitude will
be required. If, however, this be constructed according to the usual
plan of Government buildings in Washington, the expense would be so
very great as to render it doubtful whether the necessary appropriation
can be obtained, and in any event the period of time required for com-
pleting the edifice would extend over so many years that the greater
part of the collections now boxed might be destroyed by rust, decay, the
attacks of insects, &c., while the country would lose the stimulus of the
exhibition and the benefits of its study.

Any new edifice should be in connection with the present Smithsonian
building, and, in a measure, form its extension, so that the entire Na-
tional Museum might be together, and a single supervision extended
over the whole.

After a careful consideration of the problems relating to the subject
of a building, a plan has been settled upon to be presented to Congress °
for its consideration, which, it is believed, embraces, in a very marked
degree, the requirements of economy, space, convenience, comfort, and
freedom from danger of fire. The idea of this was suggested by Gen-
eral Meigs as the result of his special inquiries into public buildings
and museums abroad, and the details have been worked out by Mr.
Cluss. This involves an edifice with a floor area 300 feet square,
and so arranged as to be capable of being excellently lighted. A concrete
floor is proposed, for the purpose of keeping out moisture and preventing
the lodgement of vermin, with brick walls and an iron, slate, or metal roof.
It is believed that such a building can be completed and provided with the
necessary heating-apparatus at a cost not to exceed $250,000, or about
$2.54 per square foot. By its simplicity and uniformity of acres e, and
the absence of cut-stone or carving, it is thought that the whole can be
completed and ready for occupation within ten months’ time from its
commencement.—sS. I’. BAIRD.

GOVERNMENT EXPLORATIONS AND SURVEYS.

The following are brief accounts of the principal explorations of the
Government in 1876, from which specimens will be derived for increas-
~ing the collections of the National Museum. They are furnished by the
several directors of the explorations.
1. Under Lieut. George M. Wheeler, Engineer Department, U.S. Army.—
The geographical surveys west of the one hundredth meridian, under
anal REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

First Lieut. George M. Wheeler, Corps of Engineers, United States Army,
and reporting to Congress through the Engineer Bureau of the War
Department, were begun in 1869. In that year the present officer in
charge, while making reconnaissances for routes of communication
through Southern Nevada, conceived the idea of extending the work to
other portions of the Military Department of California. A plan for
the prosecution of the same was presented while elaborating the results
of that year’s work. Lack of funds prevented operations in 1870, but
in 1871 parties again took the field in Nevada, California, and Arizona.

At that time the work received its principal support from the appro-
priation for ** Surveys for Military Defenses,” under which head it nat-
urally fell. In 1872, however, Congress appropriated special means and
amore complete organization was made, the survey being prosecuted
principally in Utah, but also in Arizona and Southeastern Nevada. In
1873 the character of the methods employed upon this work advanced
in proportion with the prospect of its development into an accurate
geodetic survey, extending over large areas. During this season many
points accessible to the telegraph were occupied for completing the sys--
tem, now extending from Eastern California, Nevada, and Northern Ar-
izona to the eastern base of the Rocky Mountains. In 1874, connection
between the east and west portions was made more perfect. In 1875
the operations of the survey were conducted in two divisions, designated
as the California and Colorado sections, the former acting in portions of
the southern sierras and extending from the branches of the coast-
ranges south of latitude 37°, eastward toward the Colorado desert,
while the latter expanded the finished area of 1873 and 1874 in Colo-
rado and New Mexico. :

During the season of 1875 one party an the California section pontine
ued examinations for determining the practicability of diverting the
Colorado River for the purpose of irrigation. The report of Lieutenant
Bergland on this subject, and the information already submitted by the

officer in charge of the survey, are sufficiently full to place this matter
at rest for the present.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

Aside from the topographical work of 1875, gratifying results in eth-
nological research were obtained by a party of the California section
under Dr. H. C. Yarrow, detailed for that purpose. Extensive burial-
places were discovered, and it is estimated that the remains of no fewer
than 5,000 individuals were exhumed. The valuable collection made
has been submitted to Professor F. W. Putnam, of the Peabody Museum
of Archeology, for examination and study. Dr. Yarrow’s report fully
describes the explorations of this party.

The geology of portions of Southern California, Arizona, New Mexico,
and Colorado was examined and reported upon by Prof. Jules Marcou,
Dr. Loew, and Mr. A. R. Conkling. Professor Marcou makes valuable
additions to the knowledge of the field visited by him. Dr. Loew de-
scribes much of geological interest in his work of the year, besides mak-
ing a large collection of specimens. He also determines the chemical
composition of alkaline and other deposits, and of the waters of thermal
and mineral springs of Southern California, and analyzes the ores from
several mines. Mr. Conkling made a rapid and interesting examination

-of the mountain geology from La Veta Pass to the head of the Pecos
River. Much valuable mining information of a descriptive character
was obtained by the different parties.

The meteorological and hypsometrical methods, as described by Lieu-
tenant Marshall, show a commendable state of efficiency. The economic
botany and agriculture of Southern California received careful consider-
ation from Dr. J. T. Rothrock, acting assistant surgeon United States
Army, and his observations cannot fail to interest those in search of in-
formation regarding that country. In the field of zoology Mr. H. W.
Henshaw displayed his usual energy. During the season 700 ornitho-
logical specimens were secured, representing 127 species. The report
of this gentleman describes the habits, peculiarities, and localities of
these birds.

The operations of the season of 1876 were carried on in portions of
Colorado, New Mexico, California, and Nevada. The Colorado party,
traversing atlas-sheets 52, 53, 61, and 62, occupied 10 main and 51
Secondary triangulation stations, with numerous three-point, sextant
latitude, and meander stations, covering an area of 4,800 square miles.
The party in New Mexico, operating upon an area of 7,500 square miles
in atlas-sheets 62, 69, 70, 77, 78, and 84, occupied 15 triangulation, 191
three-point, and a large number of subordinate stations. Correspond-
ing results were obtained by each of the four parties acting in Nevada
and California. Base-lines were measured at Sutro, Nevada, and Colo-
rado Springs, Colo.

The working force of the season was disposed as follows: (1) the
California section, in charge of Lieutenant Wheeler, with its several
parties under the command of Lieutenants Tillman, Symons, Birnie,
and Macomb; (2) the parties of the Colorado section, under Lieutenants

s4
50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Bergland and Morrison ; (3) the office force in Washington, temporarily
in charge of Mr. George M. Lockwood.

The two sections were rapidly organized, and, except in case of the
New Mexico party, were placed in areas readily approached, in order to
gain full advantage of the season, rendered necessarily short by the late-
ness of the appropriations. The results accomplished are of more than
usual value. The detailed topographical notes from that part of the
Sierra Nevada within which lies Lake Tahoe, surrounded by a
number of outlying miniature lakes, will admit of publication upon a
scale of 1 inch to1 mile. Minute topographical details, by the plane-
table method, admitting of reproduction on a scale of 1 inch to 500 feet,
if required, were gathered in the vicinity of Virginia City, Nev., by a
party dispatched thither for the purpose of measuring a base-line.

As the result of this season’s barometric work, 749 cistern-parometer
and 3,804 aneroid stations were occupied. The highest point reached
was Pike’s Peak, 14,150 feet; the lowest was Sulphur Springs, Nev.,
3,575 feet. Fourteen mining-camps were visited.

During the past year the following publications have been made: 1
progress-map; 2 crayon atlas-sheets; 7 topographical atlas-sheets; 6
geological atlas-sheets; map of Lake Bonneville, (restored outline of
an ancient fresh-water lake;) preliminary report of 1869, revised edition ;
annual report of 1876; Volume III (Geology) of general report; Part
I (Invertebrates) of Volume IV, (Paleontology;) and Volume V,
(Zoédlogy.) Progress has also been made upon Volumes I, I, VI, and
VI, and it is expected to have the MS. of three of them in the hands of
the printer at an early date. The manuscript for Catalogue of Declina-
tion of 2,018 stars has gone forward.

The small amount of the appropriation did not admit of the employ-
ment of the usual number of geologists, zodlogists, &c., but Mr. A. R.
Conkling, as geological assistant, and Mr. H. W. Henshaw, as zoological
collector, accompanied the California section. Observations in geology
were confined chiefly to the eastern and western summits of the Sierra
Nevada Range. Abundant e. idence of the former existence of glaciers
is found in the mountains on the southwestern side of Lake Tahoe. Gla-
cial scratches were observed on Tallac Peak. Vast surfaces of rock
have been polished and grooved by these moving masses of ice, and well-
marked terminal moraines are seen on the southern banks of the lake.
Some very picturesque lakes occur in front of Tallac Peak, and, accord-
ing to Prof. Jos. Le Conte, who has studied this region carefully, these
lacustrine areas have been scooped out by glacial ice.

Near Lick’s Point, Lake Tahoe, a compact phonolite is found. The
northern side of the lake is bounded by granitic ridges. Inthe Eastern
Summit there are several ore-deposits. The principal mines are the
Montreal, Emerald, Niagara, and Clear Creek Caiion. The Carson
Valley contains numerous hot springs, and several basaltic buttes oecur
on the plain of Carson City. About one mile east of the town a mass

of yellow sandstone outcrops, which is fossiliferous, the bivalves of the
genus Unio being very numerous.

The work of Mr. Henshaw, collector in zodlogy, was mainly confined
to the vicinity of Carson City, Nevada, and the region contiguous to
Lake Tahoe. In the character of its avian fauna the pine region of the
eastern slope of the Sierras was found to nearly resemble that of the
western side, and some birds, distinctively Californian in nature, were
ascertained to range down to the foot-hills on the borders of the sage-
brush plains of Nevada.

The fish of the various streams and lakes of this well-watered region
received careful attention, and extensive collections were made. Speci-
mens of such insects as remained at this late season were collected, and,
though the results are not large, it is more than probable that they in-
clude a number of novelties, especially among the Orthoptera.

The section of country visited will prove of most value for timber,
grazing, and mineral purposes, as in most instances the altitude of the
high interior mountain-ranges precludes the certainty of crops, even
where there is arable ground. In favorable exception to this rule, how-
ever, may be noted the land in proximity to Honey Lake, in the north-
ern part of the California area, and on either side of the Rio Grande,
below Albuquerque, in New Mexico.

An important feature of the present stage of the survey results from
the instructions which require each chief of party or topographer to
take notes sufficiently detailed to permit the plotting, upon resource-
sheets, of the limits between arable, irrigable, grazing, mining,and timber
lands, indicating, also, those absolutely barren. In the office, in addition
to the regular geographical atlas-sheets, certain preliminary maps have
been arranged, from which will be prepared colored sheets, upon which
areas will be so delineated as to readily convey to the eye the general
capabilities of the section embraced. These delineations, together with
the tabulated results of the season’s observations, will give a complete
account and almost perfect idea of the natural resources of the country
and its availability for agricultural, mining, and grazing purposes, and
will graphically separate the arid, barren, and otherwise worthless tracts
from the better land. In future operations it is intended to procure
complete statistics on these important points, and the material of former
years having been digested, the comparison of large areas will then be
practicable. In addition to the data disclosing the natural resources,
the direction of drainage, with basin perimeters, will be indicated, and
the amount of rain-fall determined as nearly as practicable. The sheets
and tables will then furnish fair data for deciding upon the feasibility
of irrigating by canals, reservoirs, and artesian-wells. These maps will
be completed as rapidly as the limited force and relative importance of
different portions of the work will allow.

Through an inadvertence on page 56 of the Annual Report of the In-
stitution for 1875, it is stated in relation to geographical surveys west

of the one-hundredth meridian, that connection was had with the base-
line measured by Captain, now Brig.-Gen. E. O. C. Ord, near Los An-
geles, Cal., in 1854. The ‘‘base” in question was measured in April and
May 1853, by Assistant George Davidson, United States Coast Survey.

2. The work of the United States Geological and Geographical Survey of
the Territories, under the direction of Professor Hayden, during the season of
. 1876.—The United States Geological Survey for the season of 1876 was
divided by Dr. Hayden into five parties for field-work. The late date
at which the appropriation was made available delayed the commence-
ment of the work until late in August, so that only the completion of
the atlas of Colorado was attempted and successfully accomplished.
The work of 1876 was therefore a continuation westward of that of the
three preceding years, finishing the entire mountainous portion of Col-
orado with a belt of Northern New Mexico, 15 miles in width and a
breadth of 25 miles, of Eastern Utah, and also a rectangle of Arizona, 15
by 25 miles. The areas of exploration are located in the interior, remote
from settlements and largely on the reservation for the Ute Indians. Each
party was assigned a special area for examination, which was so selected
‘as to connect with each other topographically. The common point of
departure was Cheyenne, in Wyoming Territory.

The main division or party of primary triangulation was under the
charge of A. D. Wilson, and accompanied for part of the season by Dr. F, ’
VY. Hayden, director of the survey. The object of this party was to com-
plete the primary triangulation of Colorado. The field was taken at Trin-
idad, the southern terminus of the Denver and Rio Grande Railroad, and
the first station was made on Fisher’s Peak, a point near Trindad.
' Marching thence westward through the Raton Hills, a station was made
on Culebra Peak, one of the highest points of the Sangre de Cristo
Range. Crossing the range, the next point was Blanca Peak, the
highest peak in Colorado, one of the Sierra Blanca group of the San-
gre de Cristo Range. Its elevation is 14,464 feet above sea-level.
From the Sierra Blanca the party proceeded westward across the San
Luis Park and up the Rio Grande to its source, making two stations on
the way, one near the Summit district and the other on the Rio Grande
Pyramid. From the head of the Rio Grande the Continental divide
was crossed, and the next station made on La Plata Peak in the La
Plata group of the San Juan Mountains. From this point the party
turned northwest, traveling across the broken mesa country west of the
Dolores, making three secondary stations to complete the topography
omitted in 1875 on account of the hostility of the Indians. After occu-
pying the highest point of the Sierra Abajo, one of the isolated moun-
tain-groups of the plateau region, they went eastward to Lone Cone,
where another station was made. Thence they proceeded northward, via
the Uncompahgre agency, crossing the Gunnison and Grand Rivers to
the ; lateau region at the head of White River, a branch of the Green.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

The final station was made between the White and Yampah Rivers,
in the northwestern corner of Colorado. In the two months he was in
the field Mr. Wilson traveled 1,400 square miles, finished about 1,000
square miles of topography, and also made eleven geodetic stations,
connecting by a system of primary triangles the whole of Southern
and Western Colorado with the triangulation of the previous years.
Mr. W. H. Holmes accompanied the triangulation-party as geologist.
From the rapidity with which they were obliged to travel he was unable
to do much detailed work, but he had an excellent opportunity to cor-
relate the formations of the plains east of the mountains with those of
the pleateau region on the west. As he had previously surmised, he
found the structure of the Sierra Abajo to be identical with that of the
other isolated mountain-groups to the south and east of the Abajo in
in his district of 1875. A mass of trachyte has been forced up through
fissures in the sedimentary rocks, and now rests chiefly upon the sand-
stones and shales of the Lower Cretaceous. The sedimentary rocks are
arched from the intrusion of wedge-like sheets of trachyte, and the bro-
ken ends of the beds are frequently bent upward, as if by the upward
pressure of the igneous mass. The division left the field about the 12th
of October at Rawlins Springs, in Wyoming Territory.

The Grand River division was in charge of Henry Gannett, topog-
rapher, with Dr. A. C. Peale as geologist. James Stevenson, executive
officer of the survey, also accompanied the party a portion of the season.
The party took the field at Cation City, August 23, and marched west-
ward to the Uncompahgre agency, a few miles east of the lower dis-
trict assigned to the division. The country assigned to it for explora-
tion consisted of two detached portions, one of about 1,000 square miles,
lying south of the Sierra la Sal and east of the Sierra Abajo, extending
eastward to the Rio San Miguel and southward as far as the latitude of
Lone Cone. The other lay north of the Grand River, extending from
the river to the crest of the Roan or Book Cliffs. Its eastern limit was
the meridian of 108° and the western 109° 30’, comprising about 3,000
square miles.

Work was commenced in the southern district early in September.
The country surveyed is entirely made up of broken plateaus, almost
without water, except in the Dolores.and San Miguel Rivers, and sev-
eral smaller streams. It has very little agricultural value, but portions
of it would make fair winter-ranges for stock. The region, however, is
geologically interesting, on account of several folds which, with the
subsequent erosion, have beautifully exposed the several formations.
Coal occurs at several places in the Cretaceous rocks, and on the Uncom-
_pahgre River, a few miles above the agency, there is semi-anthracite
coal. Gold placers have been discovered on the San Miguel River,

- and in the mountains south of the district prospecting has been vigor-
ously prosecuted. This portion of the San Juan wining region bids fair
to become one of the most important and successful districts, as indi-
cated by the developments already made.

4 REPOR! OF THE SECRETARY.

The northern area is occupied by the valley of Grand River and the
foot-hills of the Roan Plateau, forming the Book Cliffs. The valley of
the Grand extends down the north side of the river for upward of a
hundred miles, with an average widtb of 10 miles, and is at present
about as valueless a piece of country as there is in any part of the
West. There is no good water except in the Grand, which is in low cation
most of its course and consequently difficult of access. The soil is a
bluish-gray alkaline clay, derived from the weathering of Cretaceous
shales, which, when dry are deep and powdery, and when wet become
a mud of almost incalculable depth. There is but little vegetation of
any kind. Part of the valley might be irrigated from the river and
thus become of value. The geology is comparatively simple, the differ-
ent formations dipping away from Grand River in regular order from
Triassic to Green River Tertiary, the latter forming the summit of the
cliffs. Coal oceurs along the cliffs, but at no locality visited was it of
economical importance. The most interesting discovery was that of
asphaltum springs, on the southern side of the crest of the Roan Pla-
teau. The mineral tar flows from fissures in Tertiary sandstones and
hardens as it pours down the walls of the cafons on which it occurs.
About a dozen of these springs were noted, some of them in connec-
tion with sulphur springs.

The party, after finishing the northern area, started for Rawlins, on the
Union Pacific Railroad, which they reached October 23, having been in
the field two months. In that time they traveled about 1,100 miles,
locating 55 topographical stations, and surveying 4,000 square miles in
about 35 working days, the rest of the time being occupied in marching
to and from and between the districts.

The White River division was directed by George B. Chittenden, as
topographer, accompanied by Dr. F. M. Endlich, as geologist. The dis-
trict assigned to this party began on the east at longitude 107° 30’,
joining the work previously done, (1874,) and extended westward to lon-
gitude 109° 30’, or about 27 miles over the Colorado line into Utah. Its
southern boundary was north latitude 39° 38’ or the approximate line
of the Book Cliffs, while the White River formed the northern limit.
The area surveyed comprised about 3,800 square miles. In working up
the topography of this district the party spent 48 days of absolute field-
work, made 4i main topographical stations and 16 auxiliary ones, and
traveled within the district about 1,000 miles. The country has bith-
erto been almost entirely unexplored, and had been described by the
nearest settlers as a broken cation country, extremely dry.. It was
marked on the maps as a high, undulating plateau, with fresh-water
lakes and timber. The party saw no lakes of over 400 yards diameter,
and but two or three of these, and timber was rather the exception.
The country is nearly all inhabitable, both winter and summer, and
considerable portions of it are valuable. About three-quarters of it is
within the limits of the Ute Indian reseivation.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 55

The general topography is a gentle rise from White River toward the
south, and asudden breaking off, when the divide is reached, into rugged
and often impassable cliffs, known on the maps as the Roan or Book
Mountains. The gentle plateau slope of the White River slope is cut
by almost numberless and often deep cations, and in many cases the
surface of the country has been eroded away, leaving broken and most
picturesque, the lower benches generally covered with cedars and
pions, and the upper rich in grass. There are four main streams
draining into the White, the most eastern of which is a large running
stream. The second has in summer no running water for the greater
part of its course, although pools of good water may be found in its
bed. The third is for the most of its length a mere trickling stream of
alkali water; while the fourth and most western one is dry for 25 miles
from its mouth and then forks, one branch containing good water in
pools, while the other is a running stream of bitter alkali. The trails
generally keep on thc summits of the ridges to avoid crossing the nu-
merous canons. Geologically speaking, the district is one of singular
uniformity. Traveling westward, the older formations, reaching back
as far as the Triassic, were found. These were followed by Cretaceous,
which in turn was covered by Tertiary. About three-quarters of the
region surveyed is covered with beds, belonging to the latter period,
dipping gently from the summit of the Book Cliffs northward. Owing to
the lithological characters of the strata, water was a rare luxury in most
parts of the district. In the far western portion and outside the limits
of the reservation, one large vein of asphaltum and several small veins
were found, with, also, running springs of the same material, all of
which, if once reached by railroads, will prove of great commercial
value. At present, they are about 50 miles from white settlements and
100 miles from the nearest railroad communication. Work was com-
pleted October 14, and the party marched eastward through Middle
Park, to Boulder City, Colo., having been in the field rather more than
two months.

The Yampah River division, in charge of Gustavus Bechler, with
Prof. C. A. White as geologist, reached the field late in August. The
district assigned to the party for exploration is virtually the northwest-
ern corner of Colorado, embracing also a small belt of country lying in
Utah. The Bear or Yampah River forms the natural boundary of this
area on the north as the White does on the south; both tributaries to
the Green and eventually of the great Colorado of the West. Their
course in general is westward through the whole extent of the district.
The eastern and western limits of the district are the same as those of
the White River district, which lies immediately to the south of the
Yampah district. Between the two rivers the country is composed for
the greater part of plateaus or table-lands, which, according to their
elevation, have the features of high plateaus, terraces, benches, and oft-
sets. This belt of country is about fifty miles in width. It is cut by
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

dry cafons and gorges, with scarcely any grass or timber. From the
White River agency, White River takes an almost due west course for
about eighteen miles, most of the way through an open valley, with
here and there a few narrow gorges. About fifty miles below the agency
the valley opens into a broad barren expanse, with scanty vegetation.
Soon after the river enters a canon, the walls of which increase until it
flows into the Green.

The Yampah deviates but seldom from a westerly course. Like
the White, it flows through a plateau country, which rises gently
from the river back for a distance of about eight miles. South of
the river are the Williams River Mountains. The Yampah traverses
the country more or less in a canon, occasionally emerging into open
grassy valleys. Where the Snake, one of its tributaries, comes in there
is a park about 8 miles in length from east to west, surrounded on all
sides by eroded terraces and plateau spurs that rise by steps to the
divide on either side. Leaving this park, the river enters a huge fissure,
and continues in caiion until it joins the Green, in longitude 109° 40/
and latitude 32° N. After the Yampab joins it, the Green also con-
tinues in cafion for the greater part of its length. All these rivers have
numerous branches from both sides, forming deep caons the greater
part of their length. As a-whole, the district is very arid and barren,
and almost destitute of trees. The total area surveyed by Mr. Bechler
is about 3,000 square miles. The rocks of the district, studied by Dr.
White, the eminent paleontologist, embrace all the sedimentary forma--
tions yet recognized by the investigators who have studied the region
that lies between the Park Range and the Great Salt Lake, viz, from
the Uinta quartzite (which underlies the Carboniferous) to the Brown’s
Park group, or latest Tertiary, inclusive. Much information was also
obtained concerning the distribution of the local drift of the region, the
extent and geological age of outflows of trap, &c. The brackish-water
beds at the base of the Tertiary series, containing the characteristic fos-
sils, were discovered in the valley of the Yampah. They are thus shown
to be exactly equivalent with those from the valley of Bether Creek, in
Wyoming Territory. The work of the past season shows very clearly
the harmonious relations of the various groups of strata over vast areas;
that, although there may be a thickening or a thinning out of beds at
different points, they can all be correlated from the Missouri River to
the Sierra Nevada Basin. Dr. White remarks that the line between the
Cretaceous and Tertiary epochs must be drawn somewhere, but that it
will be strictly arbitrary, as there is no well-marked physical break to
the summit of the Bridger group.

The Zodlogical division was in charge of Dr. Elliott Coues, U.S. A.
The party left Cheyenne on the 15th of August, and traveled westward
to Laramie Plains and thence southward into and through North Park.
From North Park they proceeded to Middle (Egan) Park, and finally
returned to Cheyenne via Berthoud’s Pass and the plains east of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5T

mountains. Collections in various departments of zodlogy were made
along the whole route traversed, but particularly on and near the Rabbit
Ear range of mountains; and careful observations were taken of the
various zodlogical phenomena which presented themselves. The collec-
tions have been deposited in the National Museum, with the exception
of the osteological material, which has been donated to the Army
Medical Museum. The material secured will become the basis of Dr.
Coues’ reports upon the zodlogy of the region explored. In the gen-
eral field-work the zodlogist in charge was ably assisted by Mr. L. M.
Cuthbert, of Washington, and Mr. W. W. Karr, of Memphis.

The Photographic division of the survey did not take the field during
1876, partly on account of the lateness of the season, but also in part
because of the accumulation of office-work. Mr. Jackson, the photog-
rapher, remained in Washington during the summer engaged in arrang-
ing the collection of Indian photographs and preparing material for the
publication of a historical and biographical catalogue of photographs of
seventy-five tribes of the North American Indians.

The survey, in addition to its field-work, prepared an exhibit for the
International Centennial Exhibition. The exhibit was divided into
models, maps, photographs, publications, sketches, and pictures in
water-colors, and chromos, and specimens. There were two classes of
models, one representing geological structure and the other the ancient
ruins of Southwestern Colorado and portions of adjacent territories.
One of the latter class represents a two-story cliff-house of the Rio Man-
cos of Colorado. It is built in the crevice of the rock, 800 feet above the
valley, in an almost inaccessible situation. Another model represents
the ruins of a double-walled tower, a form of building that seems to have
been common among the ancient inhabitants of the region. There were
also two models of a cave-dwelling of the Rio de Chelly of Northeastern
Arizona, one representing the ruins and the other their ideal restora-
tion. The geological and topographical models were as follows: Two
of the Elk Mountains, one of them being divided into sections, showing
the internal structure of the range, and the other showing only the to-
pography and geology, the latter represented by colors. The maps on
exhibition were topographical, geological, and hypsometric. The pho-
tographs and positives on glass represented the scenery and ruins of
the West and the hot springs of the Yellowstone National Park. Full
Sets of the reports, with sketches in color of scenery and in crayon of
Indians, and also specimens from the Yellowstone hot springs, added to
the exhibit.

During 1876 the following publications were issued by the survey :

- Bulletins, volume ii, (Nos. 1, 2, 3, and 4,) comprising over 300 pages,
with 110 illustrations.

Eighth Annual Report, (Colorado and adjacent territory,) 515 pages
and 88 illustrations.

3. Exploration of the Rocky Mountain Region by Prof. J. W. Powell.—
As soon as the appropriation for the fiscal year of 1876~77 could be
used, the surveying corps left Washington and proceeded to the rende-
vouz camp at Gunnison, Utah, where the field parties were organized
under the general superintendence of Prof. A. H. Thompson, geogra-
pher of the expedition. While en route they were joined by Capt.
Clarence E. Dutton, of the Ordnance Department, U. 8S. A., who had
been assigned for duty on this survey by the Secretary of War, and di-
rected to make an examination of the immense fields of igneous rocks
in Southeastern Utah.

The field organization as finally completed differed somewhat from that
of previous years—the geographic and geological work being assigned to
separate parties, each practically independent in all movements, though
working under the same general plan and within the same territorial
limits. It is believed that better results can be and have been secured
by this separation of distinct branches of the. survey than by the old
method of attaching a geologist to a geographic party or a geographer
to a geological party.

Five parties were organized—one under Prof. A. H. Thompson, to
continue the triangulation; one topographic party under Mr. Walter
H. Graves, another under Mr. John H. Renshaw; one geological party
under Mr. G. K. Gilbert, another under Capt ©. E. Dutton.

The party under Professor Thompson continued the expansion of the
primary triangulation resting on the base-lines measured in preceding
years at Kanab and Gunnison, Utah. The area embraced in this sea-
son’s work amounts to about 10,000 square miles, the instrument used
being a ten-inch theodolite of peculiar construction, designed especially
for this work by Professor Thompson.

Topographic party No. 1, in charge of Mr. Graves, extended the
secondary triangulation over an area of 6,000 square miles, lying be-
tween the Wasatch Mountains on the west, and the Green and Colorado
Rivers on the east. Mr. Graves also made a complete plane-table sketch
of the country surveyed, which, taken in connection with his angles for
locations and perspective profile sketches, will enable him to construct
a map of his district on a scale of 4 miles to the inch. The principal
topographic characteristics of this region are long lines of unscalable
cliffs, the escarped edges of terraced plateaus, of which the country is
composed, and deep, narrow cations with vertical walls, both presenting
well-nigh impassable barriers to travel.

The only considerable bodies of irrigable lands found are along the
valleys of the Green and San Rafael Rivers. The only timber-lands are
on the Sevier plateaus at an elevation of from 8,000 to 11,500 feet.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5g

The work of topographic party No. 2, under Mr. Renshaw, was con-
fined to Southwestern Utah and Southeastern Nevada, one of the most
rugged and barren sections in the Great Basin. The methods of survey
were the same as adopted by party No. 1, except that perspective pro-
file sketches were made by the aid of the orograph, a newly designed
instrument that promises to be of great use in topographic surveying.
The work of Mr. Renshaw and his able assistant, Mr. O. D. Wheeler,
was extended over about 4,000 square miles. In all this area no con-
siderable bodies of irrigable lands are found; probably not one-half of
one per cent. possessing any value except for pasturage.

A topographic survey of the Henry Mountains was made in 1875, and
a map constructed on a scale of 4 miles to the inch, but this being
thought too small a scale to admit of correct representation of the details
of the geology, Mr. Gilbert, in addition to his geological work, made
a more detailed survey of the topography, carrying a complete system
of secondary triangulation and a connected plane-table sketch over more
than 1,000 square miles. The data collected are sufficient to make a
topographic map of the Henry Mountains on the scale of 2 miles to the
inch, or 1-63000. /

The Rocky Mountain Region of the United States, (not including
Alaska,) or that portion west of the meridian of 99° 30’, was by a for-
mer Secretary of the Interior divided into districts for surveying and
mapping purposes, and these districts numbered ; the area of each dis-
trict is 24 degrees in longitude, and 14 degrees in latitude. The region
of country surveyed by the parties under the direction of Professor
Powell is embraced in districts numbered 75, 85, 86, 95, 96, 104, and 105,
the first five lying directly west of the region in which Dr. Hayden ‘is
engaged, while districts 104 and 105 lie immediately south of the other
districts in which he himself has been at work. During the earlier part
of his work, before these districts were established by the Department,
Professor Powell’s work extended in an oblique direction from northeast
to southwest along the general course of the Green and Colorado Rivers
through the districts above designated, but the work was in such condi-
tion that no one district was complete. During the present season his
parties have been engaged in extending the survey over the unsurveyed
fractional districts, so that final and complete maps of each may be con-
structed.

The methods of survey during the present season are essentially the
same as those employed during the last, being modified to a slight
extent as experience has suggested ; the chief improvements are in the
method of triangulation. In addition to the determination of geodetic
positions and general geographic features, the system of classifying the
Tands inaugurated in former years has been continued during the present,
the object of this classification being to determine the extent and posi-
tion of the irrigable lands, timber lands, grass lands, mineral lands,
and waste lands; the latter being composed of rugged mountains and
60 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

desert plains. The practical importance of this classification, if carefully
made, is great, not only in presenting the information desirable to those
who wish to settle in the country, but also in the collection of facts
neccessary to intelligent legislation concerning these lands.

In the region embraced in this survey a very small portion of the
country can be redeemed by irrigation for agriculture, and no part of it
can be cultivated without irrigation. It appears from the reports that
less than one per cent. can be thus made available. Especial care has
been given to the determination of the extent of such lands, so as to
exhibit their position on the maps. These irrigable lands and timber
lands, together with some small districts of coal-bearing lands, are the
only parts of the country that should be surveyed into townships and sec-
tions.

Having in view economy and convenience in the linear surveys of this
district, the geodetic points of the general geographic survey under the
direction of Professor Powell have been carefully marked, that they
may hereafter be used as datum points by the officers of the General
Land Office.

Extensive coal-fields exist in the region surveyed, but, as in many
other parts of the world, these coal-fields are of practical value at com-
paratively few places. The general characteristics of these coal-fields
have been the subject of much investigation, and some very interesting
and valuable results have been reached ; these will appear in the final
reports. The quantity of available coal is practically inexhaustible,
and the mines that can be economically worked are of great number.

In the Uinta Mountains silver and copper mines have been discovered
and worked by private parties. The extent of these silver and copper
bearing rocks has been determined, but their value can be established
only by extensive working.

Mr. G. K. Gilbert devoted much of his time to the study of the struc-
ture of the Henry Mountains, of which enough had been. learned in the
preceding season to warrant the belief that they embodied a type of
eruption hitherto unknown. The attention given to them has been. am-
ply repaid by the elucidation of the manner of their constitution. They
are volcanic, but their lavas, instead of finding vent at the surface of
the ground and piling up conical mountains thereupon in the usual man-
ner, ceased to rise while still several thousands of feet underground, and
lifted the superincumbent strata, so as to make for themselves deep-
seated subterranean reservoirs, within which they congealed. Over
each of these reservoirs the strata were arched and a hill or mountain
was lifted equal in magnitude to that which would have been formed if
the lava had risen to the surface; but the material of the hill was sand-
stone and shale instead of hard volcanic rock, Subsequent erosion has
carried away more or less completely the arching strata and laid bare
many of the intrusive masses. It has revealed also a system of reticu-
lating dikes which go forth in all directions from the main masses, inter-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

secting the sedimentary rocks. The lava masses, the dikes, and those
portions of shale and sandstone which have been metamorphosed by
contact with the molten rock, are harder than the unaltered sedimentary
strata which surround them, and yield to the agents of erosion more
slowly. The wash of rain and streams by which the face of the sur-
rounding country has been degraded, has been resisted by these hard
cores, and in virtue of their obduracy we have the Henry Mountains.
The deposits of lava are not all in juxtaposition but are scattered in
clusters, and each cluster has created a mountain. Mount Ellen consists
of a score of individual lava masses ; Mount Pennell and Mount Hillers
of one principal mass, accompanied by several of minor importance;
-Mount Holmes of two masses; Mount Ellsworth of a single one, with
many dikes and sheets. Each of the mountains is individual, topo-
graphically as well as structurally, and together they constitute a group
of mountains, not a range. Mr. Gilbert’s note-books contain many
sketches, by the aid of which he will be able to illustrate all the features
of the peculiar types of structure.

Before commencing the main work of the season, Mr. Gilbert made
an excursion in search of the outlet of Lake Bonneville, the great fossil
lake of Utah. During an epoch which was probably coincident with
the glacial epoch, the broad interior basin of Utah was covered by a
great lake which overflowed its rim and sent an outlet to the ocean by
way of the Columbia River. When the climate became gradually
warmer and drier, the evaporation grew greater and the rain-fall grew
less, until finally the overflow ceased and the lake began to dry away
and shrink within its shores; to-day only Great Salt Lake and Sevier
Lake remain, but high up on the mountain is carved the Bonneville
Beach, a permanent record of the old flood-tide. The search for the
point of outlet was successful, and it was found at the north end of
Cache Valley, a few miles beyond the boundary of Utah, in the Terri-
tory of Idaho. The bed of the outflowing stream was traced for a num-
ber of miles. The beach-lines were seen to run quite to the pass through
which the channel was cut, but beyond, on the side of the drainage of
the Columbia, no trace of them could be seen.

Of no less interest was the discovery of a recent orographic move-
ment at the western base of the Wasatch Range. A great fault runs
along that base; one of the faults by which the mountains were pro-
duced. The block of the earth’s crust which lies to the westward of the
fault-planes was dropped down, and the block which lies to the east-
ward was lifted up, and from the eastward block subsequent erosion
has carved the range. Along the plane of ancient movement there has
been a recent movement. The mountain has risen a little higher or the
yalley floor has dropped a little lower, and this so recently that the
‘Bonneville flood is ancient in comparison.

Capt. C. E. Dutton resumed this year his study of the large area
of igneous rocks in Southern Utah, in the vicinity of the Sevier River,
62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and has brought back additional information which he purposes em-

ploying in the preparation of a monograph of the entire tract. He has

worked out the structure of the component features, and the approxi-

mate area of the eruptions, and is engaged in classifying the various
lithologic members. The older outbreaks appear to he of early Tertiary

age, (Kocene,) and to have been nearly continuous through a long
period. The volcanic beds thus formed were subsequently traversed by
great faults, and tables were uplifted, with deep valleys between them;

the structure thus produced conforming to the general type prevalent
throughout the plateau country. The degradation of these long lofty
tables gave rise to conglomerate beds of great extent and thickness,
which are composed entirely of volcanic materials. Captain Dutton
has compared the details and arrangement of these conglomerates with
the alluvial beds now accumulating in great volume in the valleys out
of the waste of the adjoining tables, and finds an agreement between
them so close that he ascribes the same mode of origin to both. He
also finds considerable metamorphism not only in the underlying sed-
imentary beds (early Tertiary) but in the superposed conglomerate;
and he thinks it must have occurred comparatively near the surface.
The greater portion by far of the erupted rocks he classes as trachytes
and trachydolerites. The rhyolitic varieties are of very limited occur-
rence, being found only in the vicinity of the Beaver or Tunbar Range.
In the southwestern part of the field (near Panguitch) extensive fields
of basalt are found. Captain Dutton distinguishes two ages of the
basalt; one prior to the development of the present structural features
of the region, the other subsequent to it—the former being more prop-
erly dolerite or anamesite, the latter typical basalt.

Under instructions from the Interior Department, Professor Powell
and his parties have also been engaged in general ethnographic work
in the Rocky Mountain Region. One of the special items in these
instructions was the classification of the Indian tribes, such classification
being not only of scientific interest, but of great importance in the
administration of Indian affairs. For the eastern portion of the United
States this work had been accomplished—first by the unofficial labors
of the Hon. Albert Gallatin, and subsequently by the Hon. Henry R.
Schooleraft, as an officer of the Government; and some addition had
been made to the work by various persons for scientific purposes.
This work has been renewed by Professor Powell, and has been pushed
with all the energy possible with the funds at his command, and a
large amount of material has been collected by himself and by members
of his corps, and by residents in and travelers through the country.
In addition to this a large amount had been collected by the Smith-
sonian Institution through various channels—materials as yet unpub-
lished. That Institution has placed all this matter in the hands
of Professor Powell to be combined with his own collections. The first
volume of the reports on this subject will soon be issued. It treats of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

the tribes of Alaska, the western half of Washington Territory, and
Northwestern Oregon, and is accompanied by maps exhibiting the
geographic distribution of the tribes of these regions. A second volume
on the tribes of California has also been sent to the Government Printer,
which will be succeeded by others as rapidly as they can be prepared.

Dr. Elliott Coues, U. 8. A., is engaged on a ** Report on the Birds of
the Valley of the Colorado,” based primarily on the collections made by
the several parties under Professor Powell’s direction. This report was
sent to the Government Printer early in the spring, and about 200 pages
have already been set up.

Mr. L. F. Ward, the botanist of the corps, assisted by several gentle-
men of scientific ability in this department, has been engaged during
the entire year in the preparation of a “Report on the Botany of the
Valley of the Colorado,” which is now nearly ready for publication.

CONCLUSION.

From the foregoing report I trust it will be evident to all inter-
ested in the prosperity of the Institution that the establishment is still
successfully prosecuting the plan best adapted to realize the intentions
of its founder, that its funds are in a good condition, and that its repu-
tation and usefulness have suffered no diminution since the date of the
jast report.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

REPORT OF PROFESSOR BAIRD ON THE CENTENNIAL
EXHIBITION OF 1876.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, January, 1877.
Sir: I beg leave to present a statement of operations for 1876 con-
.neeted with the Smithsonian department of the United States Centen-
nial exhibit, in continuation of that given in the annual report of the
Smithsonian Institution for the year 1876.

At the end of the year 1875 the preparations for the exhibit referred
to were in full operation, involving a great deal of arduous labor, for
the purpose of having everything m readiness by the 10th of May, the
date of the opening of the International Exhibition.

As originally authorized by you, the display to be made by the
Smithsonian Institution was to include, first, the mineral resources of
the United States; second, its animal crite and third, its eth-
nology.

The superintendence of the mineral section was intrusted to Prof.
William P. Blake, of New Haven, a gentleman of much experience in
such labors and familiarly acquainted with the mining industries of the
United States generally. By visiting different localities, especially in
Michigan, Missouri, and elsewhere, and by the efforts of several assist-
ants, among them Mr. Charles M. Shepard, Mr. Howe, Professor Brod-
head, and Professor Hitchcock, supplemented by an extensive and
laborious correspondence, he succeeded in securing for the Institution
a very full display of ores, building-stones, clays, &c.

The arrangement made with Mr. Thomas Donaldson to gather a full
series of the ores of the precious metals of gold, silver and mereury.
from the Western States and Territories also continued to be highly
productive, Mr. Donaldson personally visiting a great number of mining
localities, and obtaining a full series of specimens, many of them rich
in bullion and thus of very considerable commercial value.

In no ease was either he or Professor Blake called upon to pay money
for any article, no matter what its intrinsic value, the specimens being
contributed by the owners of the mines with the understanding only
that they were to receive a suitable display in the Government exhibit
and subsequently in the National Museum in Washington.

Most of the material of these collections was sent directly to Phila-
delphia, only one of at least thirty car-loads of mineral matters being
shipped from Washington.

In addition to the objects just referred to, arrangements were effected

64
r
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 65

with several State commissioners for the exhibition in the Smithsonian
mineral department of collections made by them to illustrate the
resources of their several States, and which were delivered in the build-
ing free of cost and for the most part provided with the necessary cases
and without expense to the Centennial fund. Chief among these was
the exhibit of the State of Nevada, which was of very great extent and
made under the supervision of Mr. Whitehill, the State geologist.

A collection from Montana, made under the direction of Mr. Wool:
man, came next in interest and importance. General Wilder presented
@ series of the ores and building-stones of Tennessee in great variety,
and Mr. Joseph Wharton furnished a large quantity of raw material
and finished products connected with the nickel industry. Under the
supervision of Dr. E. R. Beadle, Dr. Koenig, and Mr. Wilcox, a very
valuable loan collection of the principal minerals of the United States
formed part of the Smithsonian exhibit.

The animal division was under the special charge of Mr. G. Brown
Goode and included the subject of the fisheries of the United States,
for which special provision. was made in the congressional appropria-
tion.

Mr. Goode prepared, with great labor, a classification of the objects
necessary to constitute such an exhibition, which was printed by the
Interior Department as No. 6 of the Bulletins of the National Museum
and widely circulated.

In addition to the objects purchased or presented to this series, sev-
eral very valuable collections were lent by various parties. Among
them may be mentioned a great variety of nets by the American Net
and Twine Company of Boston; an extensive series of apparatus used
by the angler, by Messrs. Bradford & Anthony, of Boston; of North
American furs, by Messrs. Charles Herpich & Co., of New York;
polished Unio shells from Dr. Miller and Mr. Schaffer, of Cincin-
nati, &c.

Here, as in the case of the minerals, the donations and loans were so
numerous as to render it impossible to mention them in a brief report
like the present.

The ethnological exhibit was made under the auspices of the Indian
Bureau of the Interior Department, the funds necessary for the purpose

being supplied from its share of the Centennial appropriation.

_ The preparation for the exhibition and the arrangement of the col-
lection were under the direction of Dr. Charles Rau, assisted by Mr.
F, H. Cushing. The collections in the field were made by Messrs. James
G. Swan, in Alaska and Washington Territory; by Mr. Stephen Pow-
ers, in California and adjacent States; by Major J. W. Powell, in
Arizona, Utah, and Colorado; by Messrs. Stephen Bowers and Paul
Schumacher, on the coast of the Pacific and California.

A large number of loans, especially of stone implements, &c., were

$5
66 CENTENNIAL EXHIBITION,

made by various gentlemen throughout the country, who were interested
in rendering this portion of the general exhibit complete.

The Government building was completed and. turned over to the ex-
ecutive board on the 1st of March, although the Smithsonian division
was occupied by Professor Blake prior to this with a portion of the
mineral display.

The shipments to Philadelphia from Washington began on the 20th
of April, and a very large force was necessarily engaged for a time in
the Government building in putting up the cases, for the most part
manufactured in Washington, and in unpacking and arranging the col-
lections. The contents of eighteen cars were loaded in Washington,
forwarded to Philadelphia, and unpacked, between the 20th of April
and the 1st of May, several car-loads following in the latter month.
The total number of car-loads sent from Washington amounted to
twenty-two, while nearly forty full or partly full loads were sent from —
other directions, principally containing minerals.

In arranging the various specimens in the Government building, Pro-
fessor Blake, for the mineral section, was assisted by Mr. Donaldson,
Mr. Adams, Mr. Thompson, and, for a time, by Mr. Draper.

The animal and fishery sections were placed in order by Mr. Goode,
aided by Messrs. Chester and Brown, and the ethnological by Dr. Rau,
assisted by Mr. Cushing; all the departments having many laborers and
other assistants.

On the 10th of May, the opening day of the International Exhibition,
the greater part of the Smithsonian and Fish Commission collections
was in place, although still requiring some subordinate arrangement;
and it may here be stated, generally, that the Government exhibit was
far more nearly ready on that day than any other in the Centennial
Exhibition—those of the War and Navy Departments being entirely in
order. By the 1st of June, all the collections of the Institution were in
place, the specimens labeled and everything in satisfactory condition.

In obedience to your instructions, I left Washington on the 31st of
May, to take direct charge of all the branches of the Smithsonian and
Fish Commission divisions, assisted in their respective sections by
Messrs. Blake, Goode, and Rau. Mr. Goode, however, was unfortunately
soon obliged to leave, in consequence of the illness caused by overexer-
tion, and his place was not supplied. ;

Numerous collections of various kinds were added throughout the -
season of the exbibition, partly in continuation of the special researches
instituted by the Smithsonian Institution and the Indian Bureau, and
partly by individual contributions. A very attractive feature of the
Fish Commission section was a succession of fresh fish, supplied by Mr.
EE. G. Blackford, the well-known fish-dealer of Fulton Market, New York,
who made special arrangements to secure all the varieties of Ameri-
can food-fishes, sending them in ice to the Government building and
delivering them there without any charge whatever. Here they were
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 67

shown in two immense refrigerators—one contributed by Mr. Alegretti
and one by Mr. Banta, each having its peculiarities. Here were exhibited
day by day not fewer than two hundred varieties of American fishes.
Some of the fish were kept on exhibition in a frozen condition during
the entire period of the Centennial display.

My own work I found very arduous, in consequence of the large
amount of correspondence, the number and complexity of accounts, and
the constant stream of visitors. To this was added service on two of the
groups of judges—one that of the fisheries and the other the supplemen-
tary group, instituted toward the close of the exhibition, to take cogni-
zance of exhibits which claimed consideration for award from having
been overlooked when the first series of judges prosecuted their labors.

It may be readily imagined that, however arduous the duties of the
position assigned me at the Centennial, thesassociations were extremely
agreeable, in view of the large number of intelligent and scientific men
among the judges, both American and foreign, and the gentlemen con-
nected with the several commissions with whom I was brought in contact.
The relations to the United States Centennial Commission were also ex-
tremely pleasant, the director-general, the president, and the officials
generally doing all in their power to facilitate the labors of the Govern-
ment board.

It is with much satisfaction that the members of the executive board
have been able to report to their respective chiefs the fact that the col-
lective exhibition made by the Government, under their charge, was
considered the most satisfactory and instructive display of all those
shown at the International Exhibition, both as respects extent and
variety, and the thoroughly systematic and convenient arrangement and
labeling of the collections. A printed catalogue wascontemplated and
the manuscript for the same prepared, bat the Centennial appropri-
ation would not admit of the cost. An application was therefore made
to Congress for an order to print this catalogue, but failed to receive
consideration in the closing hours of the session.

The exhibition closed on the 10th of November, in accerdance with
the original plan, or in six months from its opening, and, as is known to
every one, it continued to increase in interest until the final day. The
unusual heat of the summer deterred many persons from visiting it at
that season; but with the cooler weather of the late summer and
autumn the aie was immense, and the general result, both as to the
number of visitors and the receipts, was unexampled in the history of
similar exhibitions.

Some time before the close of the exhibition intimations had been
made by numerous exhibitors, both foreign and domestic, of a design to
make various donations of material to the United States ; but the exact
magnitude of these accessions to the collections displayed was far from
being anticipated. As it proved, not only did many private individuals
contribute their collections to a greater or less extent, but objects from the
exhibits of various States were presented, notably from those of Michi-
68 CENTENNIAL EXHIBITION.

gan, Ohio, Indiana, Tennessee, &c., in addition to the collections from
Nevada, Utah, and Montana, already mentioned as included in the
Government series. It was, however, by foreign nations that the most
important donations were made, their commissioners, with few excep-
tions, presenting either the whole or a large part of their animal-, vege-
table-, and mineral-, and to a considerable extent their industrial ex-
hibits. An accompanying list expresses in general terms the character
of the objects received from the different parties, but no adequate idea
can be formed of the whole until the collection is re-arranged in a suit-
able building in Washington.

The suggestion of the President of the United States that acknowl-
edgment be tendered by Congress to the foreign commissions which
havé made such remarkable donations to the people of this country is
oue eminently worthy of consideration.

No provision was made by Congress for the reception of the new
material referred to, beyond an appropriation, to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, for the repair and fitting up of the Armory building to receive
them in Washington ; and as the Institution is only required to take
charge of ‘ objects of nature and art, of foreign and curious research,
of natural history, mineralogy and geology belonging to the United
States,” when the same shall be ‘‘in the city of Washington,” it was a mat-
ter for consideration to what extent it would be proper to use the funds
appropriated by Congress for the Centennial Exhibition in receiving
and taking charge of such objects.

In view of their relation in most cases to subjects covered by the
Smithsonian exhibit and of the manifest discourtesy of rejecting and re-
fusing to receive such articles, I asked and obtained your permission to
take charge of them, and immediately set to work a large force in trans-
ferring them from the various buildings to the Government building.
This foree was engaged in the transfer almost uninterruptedly from the
10th of November, the closing day of the exhibition, until the middle of
February. The expenses of cartage alone to the Government building
exceeded a thousand dollars, some of the specimens being of great mag-
nitude and weighing several tons.

Simultaneously with the employment of the transfer parties, another
force was occupied in packing the collections in preparation for ship-
ment, the additions thus made being estimated to require from forty
to sixty freight-cars for their accommodation.

Reference has already been made to the expressions of interest in the
Government exhibit and in its transfer in bulk to Washington and
reproduction there. This idea was broached at an early period and its
importance urged by many influential newspapers.

The National Academy of Sciences at its meeting in October directed
its president to memorialize the President of the United States on this
subject, and, this having been done, His Excellency directed that all oper-
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

ations looking toward the transfer of the collections to Washington be
suspended until Congress might take such action as it deemed proper
in regard to the subject. This order was subsequently modified by
allowing the removal to Washington of such objects as were needed for
the use of the Departments and all such specimens as were liable to be
injured by the cold and dampness which prevailed throughout the
building after the 10th of November.

In view of the fact that the building, having been sold, was delivera-
ble to the purchaser on the 1st of March, on the 19th of January, 1877,
a final order was issued by the President directing the transfer of all the
articles to Washington, there to be stored in some suitable place or
places, pending congressional action.

I remained in direct charge of the operations of receiving, packing,
&e., until the 9th of December, when, in obedience to your instructions,
I returned to Washington and left Mr. Daniel Leech, of the Smithsonian
Institution, to direct future operations, assisted by Messrs. Chester and
Brown, the mineral collection still remaining under Professor Blake’s
special administration. These gentlemen have been diligently occu-
pied in the interval in packing the objects and in forwarding them to
Washington as fast as suitable cars could be obtained, and it is expected
that the entire series will be in Washington by the 10th of February.

It was extremely fortunate that Congress gave to the Institution the
use of the armory building, an edifice 100 by 50 feet in dimensions, and
with four floors, of 5,000 square feet each, as without it it would have
been entirely impossible to provide for one-fourth of the collection. It
was intended originally that the armory should serve as a supplement
to the Smithsonian building by exhibiting on two of its floors the fish-
ery and mineral collections, but it was soon found that any idea of a
display there must be abandoned and the building used exclusively
for the storage of objects in boxes. It is now being rapidly filled on all
its floors in this way, and any attempt at an exhibition of its contents
must be deferred until a suitable building can be constructed for the
purpose.

An extension of the National Museum by the construction of additional

wings, or other buildings, in connection with tbe Smithsonian edifice
has long been in contemplation, as for many years it has been impos-
sible to show many of the most interesting objects belonging to the
United States for want of suitable space. The Centennial collections,
however, being added to the former stock, has precipitated the crisis
in this respect and rendered it necessary that some special arrangement
be made at an early day for the accommodation of the entire series.
. The entire capacity of the Smithsonian building is now 25,000 feet of
floor space. The collections exhibited by the Institution at the Centen-
nial, covered about 34,000 feet of fluor. The donations at the close of
the exhibition will certainly require 24,000 feet, while articles stored in
the basement, and never shown at all, call for at least 20,000 feet.
70 CENTENNIAL EXHIBITION. ~

It is thought, however, that these additional collections may be con-
densed into a space of, perhaps, 50,000 feet, although the aggregate space
already mentioned would be much better suited to the exigencies of the
case, and itis therefore to be hoped that Congress will, at an early day,
take action in reference to a new building, which, of course, will be most
conveniently placed in connection with the Smithsonian edifice.

This should be constructed as cheaply as possible, consistent with the
demand for space and protection against the elements and fire. It is
thought that by laying a concrete floor on the ground, using brick walls
and piers and a roof with iron beams, and wooden sheathing covered
with tin, these requirements will be most readily met. Several plans
have been proposed for this building, some one of which it is hoped will

find favor and be adopted.
In a series of accompanying papers, I beg to present a general ac-

count of the Government exhibit, a statement of the contributions from
foreign governments, and a separate list.of the more important contri-
butions of mineral objects from American sources. .
The alphabetical list of contributions to the National Museum for the

year 1876, will also show the many smaller donations that have been
made to its several departments.

T have the honor to be, very respectfully,

SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Representative of the Smithsonian Institution and of the
Department of Food-Fishes in the Government Centennial Board.

APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. TE

PREPARATION FOR THE EXHIBITION,

Erection of building—A committee of the board of the respective De-
partments, was appointed to take into consideration all the matters
relating to this building, and to consider plans for the same; and from
several offered them, that of an edifice in the form of a cross, designed
by James H. Windrim, of Philadelphia, was selected. The floor of this
occupied 102,840 square feet, of which 20,840 was taken up by passages,
leaving a space remaining of 82,000 square feet for exhibition purposes.
It was completed and ready for occupation March 1, 1876, on which
date it was accepted by the board. The space assigned to each Depart-
ment was as follows:

The original contract for the cost of this building was $67,201.61, but
subsequent changes somewhat increased the amount. These, with other
expenses, such as grading the grounds, &c., made the total amount to be
deducted from the available fund, and divided pro rata among the vari-
ous Departments, with the exception of the Treasury and the Commis-
sion of Food-Fishes, about $94,000, leaving about $411,000 for the actual
purposes of the display.

The building was entirely of wood, and of course liable to damage
from fire. A careful guard was, however, maintained, and no accident
of any kind occurred during the exhibition.

EXHIBIT AS MADE.

Completeness on opening-day.—Although the time at the command of
the board for the preparation of the exhibit was short, and the amount
of money appropriated to carry out the plans of the several departments
was considered by them insufficient for the purpose, on the opening-day
of the exhibition most of the articles were in their places, this: being
especially the case with those of the Army and Navy; and the remain-
der were ready within the course of a few weeks later, In this respect
the Government display was in advance of those in the other buildings,
the internal arrangements of which were more or less incomplete for a
long time after the 10th of May.

Summary of exhibits in the different sections.—~The collections, as finally
arranged, consisted essentially of the following elements:
72 CENTENNIAL -EXHIBITION.

A.—The War Department.

1. The Signal-Service Bureau.—In this was shown the apparatus of
the Signal-Office proper, with its field telegraph and wagons, instru-
ments, &c., and that of the weather-observation division, with its self-
registering and other meteorological apparatus. Here observations
were made and recorded, and a copy of the daily weather bulletin
posted. ;

2. The Ordnance Bureau.—Here were shown all the machinery, in work-
ing operation, for the manufacture of cartridges and of the Springfield
rifle, together with a series of models of ordnance of different patterns,
shot, shell, &c., and outside the principal building was a laboratory
for illustrating the methods of testing ordnance and powder.

3. The Quartermaster’s Department.—This displayed specimens of the
uniforms of soldiers at different periods in the history of the American
Army, the horse-equipments, tents, blankets, &c., as also a veterinary
display illustrating the diseases of horses’ feet.

4, The Engineer Bureau.—Here were shown models of river and har-
bor improvements, including that of the excavation at Hell Gate, sam-
ples of maps and charts issued by the bureau, &c.

5. The Medical Department.—The exhibit of this department of the
Army consisted of a model hospital of the size and equipment of those
of usual construction at military posts. Here were the appliances used
for keeping and transporting sick and wounded on land and water, the
medicines used in the Army, surgical apparatus, and photographs and
engravings illustrating the surgical history of the Army, &c.

B.—The Navy Department.

1. Navy Ordnance Bureau.—In this section were exhibited the differ-
ent large and small arms used by the Navy at present and in the past,
illustrations of the torpedo system, &c.

2. Bureau of Steam-ELngineering.—This embraced specimens of the dif-
ferent forms of engines used in naval vessels.

3. The Bureau of Construction and Repair.—This exhibit included two
large working models of the Antietam, one fifty feet long, and serving ©
as a trial-ship for the cadets at Annapolis; also a model of a newly-con-
structed monitor, and a full-sized monitor-turret, with its guns, was dis-
played outside of the building.

4. Bureau of Yards and Docks.—This showed various models of the
different dry-docks belonging to the United States Navy.

5. Bureau of Medicine and Surgery.—This presented an exhibition of
the various drugs, medicines, food, &c., as prepared for use on ship-
board, together with all the equipments of naval hospitals, models of
hospital-ships, &c.

APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF -THE SECRETARY. 43

7. Bureau of Hydrography.—The most interesting portions of this
was the collection of articles illustrating the various polar explorations
of Kane, Hayes, and Hall; also specimens of charts prepared by the
Hydrographic Office, compasses, sounding apparatus, and the apparatus
used in the observations of the transit of Venus by the American par-

ties.
C.—Treasury Department.

1. The United States Coast Survey, and Bureau of Weights and Meas-
ures.—In this were shown a series of the weights and measures of the
United States, and the very complete apparatus used in the measure-
ment of base-lines for surveys. <A series of the reports of the office,
and of its maps and charts, was also displayed.

2. Light-House Board.—In this were shown the different lanterns
used for purposes of illumination; the different oils, wicks, &c.; models
of light-houses, light-ships, &c. Outside of the building was erected an
actual light-house, in full working order, and lighted every night; as
also a fog-trumpet or syren of enormous power, capable of being heard
at a distance of many miles. This was used to indicate the time daily
for the opening and closing of the Centennial Exhibition.

3. Revenue Bureau.—In this were shown the specimens of all the
forms of revenue-stamps, and the apparatus used in gauging, &c.

4, Bureau of the supervising Architect of the Treasury.—In this, models
of various public buildings were shown.

Specimens of United States currency, bank-notes, &c., were also
shown by the Treasury Department, as also a complete life-saving
station, with boats, Xe.

D.—Post- Office Department.

In this portion of the building was held the Centennial branch of the
Philadelphia post-office, fully meeting the needs of the Centennial Ex-
hibition, and kept up several weeks after the close. Here were seen in
operation machines for making stamped envelopes, samples of locks,
bags, &c., and two first-class railway postal cars.

E.— Department of the Interior.

1. Bureau of Education—In this division were shown models of
school-houses from different parts of the country and different periods
in our history ; school-furniture; apparatus for educational purposes ;
samples of school-drawing and articles used in object-teaching ; illustra-
tions of the progress of the Indian tribes in education and civilization.
._ 2, Census Bureau.—This presented the original schedules of the cen-
sus of 1790, 1840, and 1870, illustrating the progress of the country by
the comparative magnitude of the records.

3. The Patent-Office—In this was shown a selection of models from
the Patent-Ofiice, illustrating the more important stages of develop-
74 CENTENNIAL EXHIBITION.

}
ment in the industrial and economical arts from the beginning of the
Patent-Oftice system to the present day, as also a cgmplete set of publi-
cations of the office.

In connection with this display were arrangements for illustrating
the actual methods by which patents are issued in the United States,
from the first application for the purpose to its entire completion. In
the Patent-Office section were also shown a variety of historical relics,
including articles of clothing once owned by Washington, as well as his
camp furniture and equipage.

4, The General Land-Ofice exhibited its series of maps, especially one
of very large size, constructed expressly for the purpose, and showing
the present condition of the land-office system over the whole United
States.

5. The Indian Bureau.—This display, which was made in co-operation
with the Smithsonian Institution, contained illustrations of the aborigi-
nal inhabitants of the United States, both ancient and modern; speci-
mens of their stone implements and pottery ; their weapons and domes-
tic utensils; their ornaments and articles of religious observance, &ec.

6. Pension Office.

7. Geological Surveys of the Territories —Here were exhibited models
in relief of areas of the western country, and of ancient ruins, trans-
parent and other photographs of scenery, antiquities, and Indians,
books, maps, charts, &e.

F.— Department of Agriculture.

1. Chemical section —In this were shown the soils, rocks, marls, fertil-
izers, agricultural products and their derivatives, samples of food, such
as flour, sugar, &c., products of dry distillation of wood, preparations
of oils, &e.

2. Natural-history section.—This exhibited birds, insects, and other
animals injurious or beneficial to the farmer, and included a series of
300 engraved plates to illustrate a work on the economical entomology
of the United States; also models of, different fruits and vegetables,
and sections of 400 species of North American woods, with their leaves
and fruits, as wel as a series of vegetable fibers, with their applications.

5. Statistical section.—In this were shown charts and maps of the
farm-lands, the distribution of forests, and the regions suitable for the
cultivation of various staples. There were also many engravings of
agricultural colleges, &e.

G.—The Smithsonian Institution.

This illustrated, first, the operations of the Institution itself; second,
that of the National Museum of the United States under its charge.

1. The Smithsonian Institution.—This display contained a full series
of all the publications of the Institution and charts illustrating its system
of international exchanges, with a set of large charts, showing the mean:
temperature and the rain-fall in the United States.
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 75

2. National Museum, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion—In the museum section were shown collections illustrating the
economical mineral wealth of the United States, in a series of ores of
the precious and baser metals and their metallurgy, including specimens
of the metals and their simple applications; the materials used in the
manufacture of glass, such as sand, soda, &c.; and the earth and clays,
with their applications in tiles, terra-cotta, bricks, and pottery; the
different varieties of coal, petroleum; samples of the principal build-
ing stones, as marble, granite, &c.

The animal section contained, first, representations of the animals of
the United States of economical importance to the country, as furnish-
ing food, ivory, bone, leather, glue, furs, bristles, oil, &c.; second, the

apparatus by which these animals are pursued and captured ; third, the
means by which they are utilized for the wants or luxuries of man when
taken; fourth, specimens of the products of such utilization and their
simple applications ; and, fifth, the methods by which they are protected
and multiplied.

H.—The United States Fish Commission.

In this was shown a series of models in plaster or papier-maché of
the principal fishes and cretaceans of the United States, and photographs
and original drawings of the same, as furnishing oil, bone or manure,
together with the apparatus of pursuits and capture; models of boats
of different styles of construction, and special illustrations of the whale-

fishery, Also the methods of fish-culture, in illustrations of hatching-
boxes, carrying-vessels, models of fish-ways, &c. This display and that
of the animal department of the Smithsonian exhibit were more or less
united, and illustrated not only the methods and appliances of civilized
man in this connection, but also those of the American savage.

Public opinion in regard to the Government exhibit—As already re-
marked, the officers in charge of the Government exhibit were unable
to make it as complete as they had hoped, on account of the reduced
appropriation for the purpose; but as it was, it was considered by all
visitors as decidedly the best part of the International Exhibition, in
view of the extent and exhaustiveness of the collection and the method
and order of its display.

No special catalogue of the Government exhibits was printed, au-
thority not having been obtained from Congress for the purpose, al-
though a very full catalogue had been prepared.

The building was constantly the resort of intelligent visitors from all
parts of the world, and a great many critical reports have been pub-
lished already in foreign journals in regard to this display. Professor
Archer, one of the chief commissioners from Great Britain, in a lecture
recently delivered before the Society of Arts in London, uses the fol-
lowing language, in speaking of the United States Government building
and its annexes:
76 CENTENNIAL EXHIBITION.

“This group consisted of a very large edifice, in the form of a cross,
erected by the United States Government at a cost of $60,000, and, in
addition, @ laboratory, for illustrations of arsenal work, and a model
mnilitary hospital, which was of great practical utility anne the exhi-
bition. Within the chief building was displayed most interesting and
instructive collections, illustrative of the work of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and the general and geological surveys of the States, the mine-
ral, zoological, and botanical collections connected with those surveys,
and also most important ethnological and prehistoric collections. The
great collection of food-fishes of America, made for the fishery commis-
sion by Professor Baird, with the appliances for catching and preserv- .
ing fish; also series illustrating the various naval and military weapons
and engines, and’ machinery for arsenal work ; and, lastly, a complete
display of all the applications in the postal department of the States.
The general arrangement of the contents of this large building, cover-
ing about two acres, was most satisfactory, and had been carried out
under the most competent scientific supervision ; hence it was felt to be
the most instructive portion of the Centennial Exhibition. It brought
into full view a great mass of the intellectual work of some of the great-
est of American workers in the fields of science.”—Journal of the Society
of Arts, December 22, 1876.

These suggestions were based upon the exhibit as actually made and
which closed with the expiration ms the Centennial Exhibition, on the
10th of November.

DONATIONS TO THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT.

After the close of the Exhibition a new element was introduced into
the question of the transfer of the Government collections to Washing-
ton and their arrangement for inspection and study, namely, the dona-
tion to the United States of many objects or entire collections, that had
been displayed elsewhere in the Exhibition than in the Government
building. These were derived from two sources :

Ist. From American State commissions and private exhibitors, by
whom much material of great value was presented and tending to fill
up important blanks.

2d. From the commissions of the several foreign governments parti-
cipating in the International Exhibition of 1876.

The experience of previous expositions had indicated the probability
of contributions from the latter source, and to meet the expected emer-
gency Congress at its last session granted the Armory building to the
National Museum, and made an appropriation for the purpose in the
following words:

“For repairing and fitting up the so-called Armory building, on the
mall, between Sixth and Seventh streets, and to enable the Smith-
sonian Institution to store therein, and to take care of specimens
of the extensive series of the ores of the precious metals, marbles,
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

coals, and numerous objects of natural history now on exhibition in Phil-
adelphia, including [any] other articles of practical and economical value,
presented by various foreign governments to the National Museum,
four thousand five hundred dollars: Provided, That the said sum shall
be expended under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution.”

The contributions from the States were of very great value; Nevada,
Utah, Montana, Tennessee, &c., presenting most valuable series of their
ores, while an aggregate of much magnitude was received from indi- .
viduals ; minerals, metals, ores, building-stones, coals, pottery, &c., all
being included. It was, however, from the foreign commissions as
above referred to that the greatest mass was derived, so that, although
the gift of some articles was anticipated, the members of the Govern-
ment board were not prepared for the wholesale donation of by far the
greatest portion of the collective exhibits made by foreign nations, as
well as those of many of their individual exhibitors. Among these may
be mentioned specimens of mining and metallurgy, ores, metals, com-
bustibles, building-stones, earths, clays, tiles, terra-cotta, and pottery;
vegetable products, as samples of woods, fibers, seeds, medicinal plants,
&c., furs, skins, gelatine, samples of industrial products in the way of
woven and plaited fabrics, objects in metal, wood, glass, earthen wares,
illustrations of manners and customs, &e.

List of countries from which donations were received.—The nations from
which were received the collections in question are the following:

Argentine Republic. Russia.
Austria. Spain.
Africa, (Orange Free State.) Philippine Islands.
Belgium. Sweden.
Brazil. Switzerland.
Chili. Tunis.
China. Turkey.
Egypt. United Kingdom and Colonies.
France. Bermuda.

- German Empire. Canada.
Hawaiian Islands. New South Wales.
Japanese Empire. New Zealand.
Mexico. Queensland.
Netherlands. South Australia.
Norway. Tasmania.
Pern. Victoria.
Portugal. Venezuela.

_ The commissions which are not included in this list had nothing at
their disposal, their exhibitions consisting either purely of private ma-
terial reclaimed or otherwise disposed of by their owners, or, as in the
case of several British colonies, of articles borrowed from the colonial
museum in London and necessarily returned there.
78 CENTENNIAL. EXHIBITION.

Assignment of collections received.—W hile no special authority had been
given by Congress to receive these articles, it was not considered proper to
refuse them, and they were accordingly taken charge of by the several de-
partments of the Government to which they were most nearly related. An
exhibit of the iron, chain-cables, cordage, &c., of the naval department of
Russia was received by the representatives of the Navy Department. To
the Bureau of Education was delivered everything of an educational char-
acter. The Department of Agriculture received the articles belonging to
the vegetable kingdom, suchas sections of wood, fibers, grains, seeds, &c.,
while articles belonging to the mineral and animal kingdoms, and as
illustrative of the manners and customs of the people, were taken by the
Smithsonian Institution, and objects relating to the fisheries by the
United States Fish Commission.

Accompanying com munications from some of these departments give
in fuller detail the character of these donations. Suffice it to say, that so
far as the Bureau of Education, the Department of Agriculture, the Smith-
sonian Institution, and the Commission of Food-Fishes are concerned,
the collections promise to exceed in magnitude their own Centennial ex-
hibitions

PROPOSED TRANSFER OF THIS COLLECTION TO WASHINGTON.

General feeling on the subject—The interest in the exhibition of the
Government very naturally suggested to many the importance of trans-
ferring it to Washington and maintaining it in its original form, and
numerous suggestions and earnest appeals to that effect have already
appeared in the public press. This feeling met with special expression
in a resolution of the National Academy of Sciences, at its session in
Philadelphia in October; and in compliance with its instructions, Pro-
fessor Henry, its president, transmitted to the President of the United
States the following communication :

‘¢ SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
““ Washington, D. C., November 13, 1876.
“To His Excellency the President of the United States ;

‘Str: I have the honor to inform you that at a meeting of the Na-
tional Academy of Sciences, held in October last, the following preamble
and resolutions were unanimously adopted:

‘*¢ Whereas the members of the National Academy of Sciences have
been greatly impressed by the extent, rarity, and richness of the truly
national collection contained in the Government building at the Centen-
nial Exhibition, and considering the great importance and lasting in-
terest with which the people of the United States must regard this col-
lection: Therefore,

“ ‘Resolved, That in the opinion of the Academy the Government col-
lections as a whole should be transferred to Washington, and there pre-
served in an appropriate building for perpetual exhibition.

“Resolved, That the Academy entertains the hope that the President
APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 79

of the United States will favor the foregoing proposition; that he will
delay the dispersion of the exhibit from the several Executive Depart-
ments until Congress has assembled, and that he will recommend to
that body to provide for the transfer of the Government collection to
the city of Washington, and for its subsequent permanent support.’

“In transmitting these resolutions to your Excellency, I beg leave, in
favor of the proposition, to suggest, first, that the exhibit would form a
fitting memorial of the centennial condition of the country; second,
that it would illustrate in a striking manner the appliances used by the
Government in carrying on its various and complex operations; third,
that it would be a repository in which the natural resources of each
State would be exhibited; fourth, that it would give information, in
one view, of importance to the statesman, legislator, scientist, educator,
and the capitalist of our own and of foreign countries ; fifth, it would be
of interest to the intelligent public at large, and would meet the appro-
bation of all who regard the prosperity of the country, and take pride
in the condition of the national capital.

‘Tn conclusion, it may not perhaps be improper to remark that I do
not advocate this proposition for the purpose of extending the power
and influence of the Smithsonian Institution. On the contrary, I think
the exhibit should be made a truly national one, and be immediately
under the control of the Government.

*‘T have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

“JOSEPH HENRY,
“President National Academy of Sciences.”

Economical value of the collection—Embracing as these donations do
the essential portion of the displays of foreign nations, such as their
natural products, general industries and educational and scientific
methods, &c., it is clearly evident that the element of the Centennial
Exhibition of most importance to the American people, has thus been
left to it, in the closing of the Centennial, and if properly administered
must conduce in a very great degree to the material and mental ad-
vance of the nation. By re-arranging it in a systematic manner, in
connection with the articles already shown, a most instructive and im-
portant museum can be made available to the people of the United
States. We are assured that no such collection as this is to be found
in any part of the world; and it is very doubtful whether it can ever
again be reproduced, as many of the nations represented at the Centen-
nial have intimated their intention of not taking part in the Paris or
any future exposition.

Distribution of duplicates —As might be expected, a large amount of
duplicate material accompanies these donations to the United States
from American and foreign sources, which, when a final arrangement is
accomplished, can, if Congress so direct, be distributed to various edu-
cational and industrial establishments throughout the United States.

Commercial value. —The expenditures of the United States, for an ex-
80 CENTENNIAL EXHIBITION.

hibition lasting but six months have amounted to nearly $600,000. The
donations from our own States and individuals, tending to fill up
some of the gaps and complete the American display, which an insuf-
ficient appropriation interfered with, and those from foreign nations
which have been given to the United States, can hardly be considered
as overvalued at $400,000, and we therefore have an aggregate of prop-
erty, in value, of at least a million of dollars to provide for.

Future increase of collections.—Promises have been made by most of
the foreign commissions to complete any portion, illustrating the natural
products and industries of their respective countries whenever the
arrangement of the collection shows the deficiencies.

Action of the President in regard to transfer.—In view of the magnitude
of the collections thus acquired by the United States, and the inad-
equacy of any present provision for their transfer to Washington, and
their arrangement here, as also in view of the urgency of the appeal
of the National Academy of Sciences, the President, under date of
November 17, 1876, issued an order forbidding the removal of the articles
in the Government building until some arrangement could be made
in regard to them. This order was subsequently modified by allowing
such objects as were required for the use of the Government in Wash-
ington or elsewhere, to be transferred, as also such as were liable to
deeay or injury by remaining in a building exposed to cold and damp-
ness. The greater part of these articles are now stored in the Govern-
ment building at Philadelphia, waiting some action on the part of Con-
gress.

Demolition of Government Centennial building soon required.—As the
contract made by the park commission with the Centennial Commis-
sion requires the removal of all the buildings within 60 days of the close
of the exhibit, it is necessary to take speedy action on this subject;
and if Congress does not see fit to erect a building at the present time
for the proper display of the collections, measures must at any rate be
authorized for their removal to Washington, and their storage in some
safe place, as the appropriations made to the Government board did not
contemplate these foreign and domestic donations in their enormous.
aggregate, and are entirely inadequate to handling them. The articles of
this character, in charge of the Smithsonian Institution alone, will, it is
stated, fill fifty freight-cars to their utmost capacity, in addition to the
collections ._prepared by the Institution directly for the exhibition, and
moved from Washington to Philadelphia in the spring of 1876.

As the Government building embraced an area of about 100,000
square feet, it is evident that one of less magnitude would not suffice
for the reproduction of an exhibit of the original and acquired material.

AND ARCHAEOLOGY.

TO THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, WASHINGTON, D. C.

“The importance of the scientific work done by the Smithsonian In-
stitution and the great value of its publications are everywhere ac-
knowledged. The exhibits representing its museum, now known as the
‘National Museum,’ are very extensive and of very high merit. This
statement is made, not without regret that the funds of the Institution
are inadequate to a yet larger work in the many important fields it has
occupied, and in the hope that, to the end of such enlargement of its
labors, the Government of the United States will early relieve the In-
stitution of the necessity to use any portion of a fund consecrated to
‘the increase and diffusion of knowledge’ for the maintenance of a mu-

seum intended primarily to represent the resources of the United
States.”

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The collections of the surveying and exploring expeditions of the
Government forming the National Museum continue to be in charge of
the Smithsonian Institution, Congress making annual appropriations for
the care and preservation of the specimens. The estimate submitted
for this purpose for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1877, was $25,000,
but the amount granted was only $10,000. This large reduction in the
appropriation rendered it necessary to discharge the larger portion of
the scientific and laboring force of the museum, and to retain scarcely
enough to exhibit and preserve the specimens without attempting any
work in the way of making up sets of specimens for distribution to
other museums, colleges, and academies.

To provide for the temporary storage of the large collections which
would be received from the Centennial Exhibition, Congress at its last
session granted to the Institution the use of an edifice on the mall,
known as the “ Armory building,’ and appropriated $4,500 for its
repair. » The building was in a dilapidated condition, and required all
of this appropriation to put it in substantial repair, leaving nothing
for heating and other arrangements. A small additional appropriaticn
is recommended to be asked for at the present session of Congress to
complete the repairs.

It was stated in the last report that it had been foul necessary for
properly carrying on operations connected with natural history, for ~
-which no conveniences existed in the Smithsonian edifice, that a sepa-
rate building should be erected on the grounds; and the necessity for
this was the more urgent on account of the large preparation of new
specimens required for the Centennial Exhibition.

For this purpose $3,000 were granted by Congress. This sum was
expended, but was found insufficient, and the remainder, to complete the
building, was advanced from the income of the Smithson fund.

The amount thus advanced, $3,927.84, it is hoped, will be refunded to
the [nstitution by an appropriation in the deficiency bill of this session.

| INSTITUTION.

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 24, 1877.

A meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
was held this day at 7 o’clock p. m. in the office of the Secretary.
Present, Chief-Justice Waite, Chancellor of the Institution; Hon. H.
_ Hamlin, Hon. J. W. Stevenson, Hon. H. Clymer, Hon. G. W. Reeders
_ Hon. Peter Parker, Hon. Ganeee Bancroft, Prof. Asa Gray, and Pro-
fessor Henry, the Secretary.
The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved.
4 Excuses for non-attendance were received from Professors Dana and
 Coppée.
_ The Secretary presented a general exhibit of the condition of the
_ fund and the receipts and expenditures for the year 1876. He stated
that to save time these statements and all the accounts of the Instita-
_ tion had been referred by him to the executive committee, who were
prepared to report at the present meeting.
Dr. Parker, in behalf of the executive committee, presented the an-
nual report of the receipts, expenditures, estimates, &c.
On motion of Mr. Hamlin, the report was adopted.
The Secretary called the attention of the Board to the great increase
of the National Museum during the past year from specimens pro-
- cured from the appropriation by Congress for the Centennial, from the
donations of States of the Union, from individuals, and from foreign
_ governments. He stated that for the exhibition of these articles an ad-
_ ditional space of four times that afforded by the present Smithsonian
edifice would be required ; that therefore an additional building was
_ absolutely necessary, and as this could not be erected out of the Smith-
Son fund, an appropriation from Congress must be asked for.
* On motion of Dr. Parker, the following preamble and resolution were
_ adopted, and the Secretary was instructed to transmit them to Congress:
_ Whereas Congress, in the organization of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, directed that it should make provision on a liberal scale for a
Museum to contain all the objects of natural history and of curious and
foreign research, then belonging to or hereafter to belong to the United
States Government: and
Whereas, in accordance with this direction, the Institution has devel-
oped and for many years principally supported this national museum,
the collection being the property of the Government, while the build-
ing was erected for their accommodation at a cost of $500,000, out of
the income of the Smithson fund ; and

from the last meeting.
Professor Gray presented the following. report of the special com-
mittee on the Museum:

REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITIEE.

- When Congress, thirty years ago, enacted the law which established |
this Institution, it probably did not anticipate the state of things to ©
which we have arrived. The income of $500,000 must then have ap-
peared much larger than it does now, and the several undertakings ~
which were devolved upon it must have been contemplated upon a mcd-
erate scale, if it was supposed that the means would compass the ends. —
A library, upon which $25,000 annually might be expended, a gallery of |
art, 2 chemical laboratory, a geological and mineralogical cabinet, nec- —
essary lecture-rooms, and, by implication, Jecturers, a museum of natural ©
history and natural produets, to include all the materials then belong- —
ing, and thereafter to belong, to the United States, (and we see how ||
vast that item has become,) these all have assumed a magnitude far |
beyond what could have been contemplated ; and yet they do not. cover |
those operations for ‘the increase and diffusion of knowledge among —
@

men” which have given to the Smithsonian Institution its chief reputa-
tion and greatest usefulness throughout the civilized world.

The reasonable explanation of the terms of the organic law (and which
those who were familiar with the discussions at thé time know to be the
true one) is, that Congress did not attempt to define the particular course
which the Institution should take, probably because under the conflict-
ing and incongruous views that were urged, it did not clearly see its
way todo so. But while the law allowed all the available income to be
devoted to a library, if the Regents should think proper to give the new
establishment that direction, it required scientific cabinets, laboratories,

i! &c., which looked to a certain amount of development upon a different

line. The act indicated two or three allowable lines along which the
Institation might develop, either of which would soon have absorbed
‘allthe income. Under it the Regents might have converted it essentially

- into a library, into an educational establishment, or into a museum,

Under it they also might, still fulfilling the required conditions, develop

lines of operation which come closer to the express intent of the founder,

which intent must have been the governing principle of the whole enact-
ment. And this is what our prédecessors did. It is not surprising that
this small body, having the responsibility laid upon it, should have

_ adhered as closely as possible to the terms of Smithson’s will “ founding

an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among

_ men.” We. believe that the propriety and the wisdom of their course,
confirmed by the results, is now unquestioned.

That the museum and other collections mentioned in the act of estab-
lishment must have been regarded as a subsidiary feature, and the

_ library equally so, (except upon the alternative of its having the lion’s
_ share,) would seem evident from the fact that these were to be main-

tained upon the income of the Smithsonian fund, while the objects com-

_ posing them belonged, and appear still to belong, to the Government of
_. the United States, and to be held in charge of the Institution for exhibi-

tion and study. Accordingly, when these collections increased to such
extent that the care and exhibition of them threatened to absorb a

large part of the income of the Smithson fund, and to cripple legitimate
operations for the increase and diffusion of knowledge, which the Regents
had at thé outset originated, and of which experience had shown the

_ wisdom so soon, we say, as these Government collections began to press

heavily upon the institution, Congress, being informed thereof, made
provision for assuming this burden. 1t has made increasing provision

__as the collections have themselves increased in magnitude and cost of

maintenance. It has thereby manifestly acted upon the theory that

_ these museums are national property. The alternative view, viz, that

they are gifts, supplemented with gifts for their support, would be fatal

_ to the Institution, for the objects remain, continually increase, and can-

not be declined, while the gift for their maintenance may at any time

cease to be made. Uyon this theory, Congress could at any time con-

-
126 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

vert this Institution into a museum, and that without any legislation
whatever, by merely omitting to make an annual appropriation. For,
without taking intoaccount the vast Centennial gifts of foreign countries, —
the collections will now more than fill the Smithsonian building, and

their care and exhibition would absorb its whole income.

We are therefore bound to conclude that the Board of Regents, as re- —
spects these national collections, acts as the trustee of Congress. Under
this state of things, and in view of the ever-increasing magnitude and |
interest of these collections, the relation of this Institution to the |
National Museum becomes a matter for grave consideration.

In contemplating it we should be mindful of a policy which the Re-
gents have pursued of economizing the means and energies of the Insti-
tution by doing all it can through others; by taking up no line of use-
fulness, however inviting, which is. otherwise provided for, and even —
relinquishing important fields upon which it had entered, whenever
other agencies were at work in them and were found adequate to occupy
them. Thus the important field of meteorology, upon which, at the
outset, the Institution systematically entered, was surrendered to the
Signal Bureau, which Congress has enabled to cover the ground. To
avoid needless duplication of books and librarians, it has consolidated
its library with that of Congress, and contributes to the latter the com-
plete series of transactions of learned societies, journals, and other pub-
lications which it receives by exchange, or from time to time may pur-
chase, not parting, however, with the right of property, and thus con-
tinuing to fulfil, according to its best judgment, the duty of making
provision ‘for the gradual formation of a library composed of valuable
works pertaining to all departments of human knowledge.” So also
when Mr. Corcoran founded a gallery of art, and endowed it with

double the amount of the original Smithsonian fund, our unimportant |

collections in that department were contributed to it, and the Institution
may now fairly hold itself absolved from the duty of maintaining “a
gallery of art.”

Our Secretary, in his annual report submitted on the 26th of January,
1876, has now raised the grave question whether. the well-being of the
Institution would not favor or even require the adoption of a similar
policy as regards the National Museum. He declares that it is most
“desirable that a more definite distinction between the two establish-
ments, if not an entire separation, should be made,” and he urges the
subject upon our attention by considerations which cannot be disre-
garded.

Your committee was appointed to take thought upon this subject.
The vast increase of museum objects in natural history, ethnology, aud
materials of industrial art, consequent upon the Centennial Exposition,
an increase far beyond the largest anticipations, gives new importance
and urgency to this question.

A favorable action by the present Congress upon the suggestion made

to it by a resolution of this Board, at the last meeting, viz, for the

erection of a large but comparatively inexpensive building, annexed to
_ the present edifice, to contain these great accessions to the museum,
Be would do away with the present embarrassment in that regard. The

suggested acquisition by Government of the present Smithsonian edi-

- fice, already mainly filled with its collections, would give a desirable

unity and prominence to the National Museum, and might sufficiently
mark that ‘‘ definite distinction between the two establishments” which

_ our Secretary suggests as needful. We agree that a more marked dis-

tinction than now appears to exist is desirable, for the avoidance of

_ present misapprehension and future complication.

But we apprehend that both these desirable snloee may not suffi-

ciently provide against the danger that the Smithsonian Institution may

become wholly subsidiary to the museum, and be perhaps crippled by
it. The Institution has only one executive officer, with undivided

responsibility, who may, with our consent, ‘‘employ assistants,” but we

look to him alone, and all must pass through his hands. His scientific
labors in conducting the Institution, not to speak of those somewhat

_ extraneous, of which he might possibly be relieved, are various, impor-

tant, and exacting. Much will be lost if the executive head of this
Institution shall be other than a man of broad scientific culture and
experience, commanding the regard of the scientific world, and the con.
fidence of the many who depend upon his judgment. His time and
powers must be divided between such duties as are here referred to, and
those of administration. Now the proportion which the museum bears

- to the Institution proper is already large, and it threatens to be* pre-

dominant. We have no desire to check its immense development, and
we contemplate with satisfaction its sure popularity ;. but, as respects
the burden which the museum throws upon our Secretary, we may say
that it is already heavy, and that it threatens to be injuriously large.
If not provided against, the time seems sure to come when the museum
will mainly absorb the working energies of the Institution.

In the next place we must all agree that the looking after Ganeress

ional appropriations in the present mode is not desirable. The Secre-

tary has called attention to this. An objectionable feature would be
removed if the appropriations were made directly in the name of the
National Museum, and if it became possessed of the present edifice. But

Still the duty of preparing or supervising and of anxiously furthering the

annual appropriations for the museum, would devolve upon our Secretary.

We would also remark that this great museum must have a large
number of employés, many times more than the Institution itself needs
for its uses. This great extension of patronage cannot be contemplated
without anxiety. Under the present organization this patronage is
vested in the Secretary. So far as the Institution is concerned, it were -
much better not to have it. On the other hand it may well be that the
128 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS ©

‘
Government would prefer some such administration of the museum as
this board secures.

No present action is proposed by this committee, beyond the recom-
mendation that the distinction between the Institution itself and the
museum under its charge should be mads as prominent as possible. The
very great development which the museum is now undergoing May soon
bring the whole subject before the Board in a practical. form. If the
next Congress should adopt a plan to which the Secretary adverts, (but
which seems unlikely,) namely, that of transferring the museum to a

new building to be erected for the National Library, the separation which —

the Secretary recommends would be at once complete. In that event,
since the Smithsonian building was erected in great part for containing
these collections, we will not doubt that Congress would indemnify the
Institution by re-imbursing an equitable portion of the original outlay.
On the other hand, if the museum is to develop to its full size and im-
portance upon the present site, according to the plans laid before the
Board, and by it recommended to Congress, this will, as 1t seems to us, |
almost necessarily involve the acquisition by the Government of our
present edifice ; and that will pave the way for an entire separation of
administration, or to such other adjustment as the Board of Regents may
then think best, or be able to accomplish.

WASHINGTON, February 5, 1877.

A meeting of the Board of Regents was held this day at 7 o’clock
p. m., in the office of the Secretary.

Present, Chief.Justice Waite, Chancellor; Hon. T. W. Ferry, Hon. J.
W. Stevenson, Hon. A. A. Sargent, Hon. H. Clymer, Hon. G. W. Me-
Crary, Hon. P. Parker, Hon. Geo. Bancroft, and the Secretary.

The minutes of the last meeting were read and approved.

Mr. Bancroft, from the special committee appointed at the last meet-
ing, presented the following report of a memorial to be sent to Congress:

MEMORIAL

To the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America
in Congress assembled.

The undersigned, Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, beg leave
respectfully to lay before you a question which has suddenly arisen, and
which can be solved only by your authority.

In the year 1846, on the organization of the Smithsonian Institution
‘for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,” Congress, to
the great relief of the Patent-Office and other public buildings, devolved
upon the Regents of that Institution the custody of “all objects of art
and of foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history,
plants, and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging or here.
after to belong to the United States, which may be in the city of Wash-
ington.”

In accordance with this enactment, the Institution has received and

carefully preserved all the specimens which have been brought together
from more than fifty public exploring expeditions, and has added speci-
mens collected by itself, or obtained from foreign museums by exchange,
till its present edifice, in the beginning of 1876, had become full to over-
flowing.
. By an act bearing date July 31, 1876, additional duties were laid upon
the Smithsonian Institution as custodian, and $4,500 were appropriated
“for repairing and fitting up the so-called Armory building, on the mall
between Sixth and Seventh streets, and to enable the Smithsonian In-
stitution to store therein and to take care of specimens of the extensive —
series of the ores of the precious metals, marbles, building stones, coals,
and numerous objects of natural history now on exhibition in Philadel-
phia, including.other objects of practical and economical value presented
by various foreign governments to the National Museum.”

As a fruit of this act of the General Government, the Smithsonian In-
stitution finds itself the custodian of enormous collections that had been
displayed at the Centennial Exhibition, and on the closing of that ex-
hibition, had been presented tothe United States. These donations are
made by individuals among our own citizens, by foreign exhibitors, and
by several of the States of the Union, and there is scarcely a power in

s9
130 JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS.

the civilized world in any region of the globe which has not taken part
in these contributions, and some of them with the largest generosity.
Men of science, most competent to pass judgment, pronounce them to be
of immense value, and are of opinion that, including the gifts from States
of the Union and the exhibits of the United States, they could not have
been brought together by purchase for less than a million of dollars.

That the magnitude and value of the donations from foreign govern-
ments may be manifest, we annex to this memorial the list of the more
important of them, as Seger by Prof. S. F. Baird, who represented
the Smithsonian Institution at Philadelphia. Their nae apie exhibition
requires an additional building, which shall afford at least four times
the space furnished by the present edifice of the Institution.

The Government of the United States is now in possession of the
materials of a museum, exhibiting the natural products of our own
country, associated with those of foreign nations, which would rival in
magnitude, value, and interest the most celebrated museums of the old
world.

The immediate practical question is, shall these precious materials be
for the most part packed away in boxes, liable to injury and decay, or
shall they be exhibited?

It was the act of Congress which ordered the acceptance in trust of
these noble gifts to the United States. The receiving of them implies
that they will be taken care of in a manner corresponding to the just
expectations of those who gave them; and one of the prevailing motives
of the donors was that the productions of their several lands might con-.
tinue to be exhibited. The intrinsic value of the donations is moreover
enhanced by the circumstances under which they were made. They
came to us in the one-hundredth year of our life as a nation, in token of
the desire of the governments of the world to manifest their interest in
our destiny. This consideration becomes the more pleasing when we
bring to mind that these gifts have been received not exclusively from
the great nations of Europe from which we are sprung, or from the
empire and republics on our own continent beyond the line, but that
they come to us from the oldest abodes of civilization on the Nile, from
the time-honored empires and kingdoms of the remotest Eastern Asia,
and from the principal states which are rising into intellectnal and
industrial and political greatness in the farthest isles and continent;
from states which are younger than ourselves, and bring their contribu-
tions as a congratulatory offering to their elder brother.

We have deemed it our duty to lay these facts and reflections before
both houses of Congress, and to represent to them that if they in their
wisdom think that this unequaled accumulation of natural specimens
and works interesting to science, the evidence of the good-will to us that
exists among men, should be placed where they can be seen and studied
by the people of our land and by travelers from abroad, it will be neces-
sary to make an appropriation for the immediate erection of a spacious

JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS. ae:

building. Careful inquiries have been instituted to ascertain the smallest
sum which would be adequate to that purpose; and the plan of a con-
venient structure has been made by General Meigs, the Quartermaster-
General United States Army. We beg leave further to represent that
to accomplish the purpose there would be need of an appropriation of
$250,000. This amount is required, not as a first installment to be fol-
lowed by others, but as sufficient entirely to complete the edifice. Should
this appropriation be made at an early day, the building could be ready
for the reception of articles before the next session of Congress.

On motion of Mr. Stevenson the report of the committee was adopted,
and all the Regents present signed their names to the memorial,* which
was placed in the hands of Mr. Stevenson to be presented to the Senate,
and Mr. McCrary to the House of Representatives. .

Mr. Clymer offered the following resolution, which was unanimously
adopted :

Resolved, That the executive committee be authorized and requested
to have a life-size portrait of the Secretary of the Institution painted
by some competent artist, which, when finished and approved by the
Regents, shall be preserved and kept in testimony and memory of the
devoted, unselfish, and renowned services of Joseph Henry in behalf of
the “ increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

The Board then adjourned sine die.

The following is the list appended to the foregoing memorial :

EULOGY “ON GAY OU SiS ats
By M. ARraGo.

INTRODUCTION.

The biography which I am about to read is of unusual length, not-
withstanding the numerous excisions I have made in it this very |
morning. I might, as an excuse, say that Gay-Lussac is no ordinary |
academician; that he will occupy a very eminent position in the scien-
tific history of the first half of the nineteenth century; that the titles
alone of the important memoirs-he has published would fill a large num-
ber of pages, &e., &e.; but, I prefer frankly acknowledging it, I was too
late in discovering that I had exceeded the established limits, and when
there no longer remained the necessary time for giving a new form to
my work. I therefore resign myself unreservedly to any criticisms that |
the subject may call forth. I will merely observe to all those who, coming
here to seek relaxation, should unfortunately only find weariness, that
an old man, drawn into dwelling even to garrulity upon the divers merits
of a friend, has perhaps some claim to indulgence.

CHILDHOOD OF GAY-LUSSAC—HIS ADMISSION TO THE POLYTECHNIC
SCHOOL.

Joseph Louis Gay-Lussae, one of the most illustrious scientists of
which France can boast, was born, September 6, 1778, at Saint Leonard, |
a small town of the ancient province of Limousin, situated near the
frontier of Auvergne. His grandfather was a physician, and his father
king’s procurateur (prosecutor) and judge at Pont de Noblac.

Those who have had an opportunity of observing the frigid reserve
which characterized Gay-Lussac in mature age will be undoubtedly sur-
prised to hear me say that in his childhocd he was boisterous, turbulent,
and very venturesome. To justify my appreciation, I will cite one fact
from a thousand which I have gathered from the lips of Gay-Lussae
himself, and which was also related to me by his relatives: A venerable
eure, uncle of our future associate, occupied a house only separated from
that of Gay-Lussac’s family by a small yard; he had established his
fruitery in a room on which looked the chamber where Gay-Lussac and
a brother, a year younger, were in the habit of studying. <A desire to
taste the forbidden fruit took possession of Gay-Lussac. He hurriedly

133

stretches, with all imaginable difficulty, a pole from the window of this
room to that of the good curé; and armed with a stick, to the end of
which the blade of a knife was securely attached, he places himself
astride upon the fragile bridge; the end of his excursion reached, he
breaks a window-pane, pierces the finest of the fruit with his instrument,
and returns triumphant, safe and sound, to his own apartment. This
exploit, which might have cost him his life, was repeated several times
at short intervals. Finally, Gay-Lussac’s parents suspected the truth,
and the two brothers were taken to the priest to ask pardon. The first
thought of the child was to deny, but the evidence of his guilt became
clear. Gay-Lussac experienced such humiliation at being surprised in
the very act of telling a falsehood that he resolved never again to depart
from the truth, a resolution religiously kept during the rest of his life.
Those who like to seize, in the boyhood of great men, indications of the
character exhibited later in life, will pardon me if I interrupt for a mo-
ment the order of dates to relate another anecdote remembered by our
associate with very natural pleasure; this likewise involves a question
of apples.

Gay-Lussac having gone to Paris, the superintendent of the school in
which he was placed one day discovered that several apple-trees in his
garden had been completely stripped. As the offense could not, he
thought, be attributed to the pupils, since in order to pass from the
yard to the garden, it was necessary to climb two high walls, he resolved
to dismiss the servants. Gay-Lussac learns this, solicits and obtains an
interview, and then exclaims, ‘The servants are innocent; it is the
pupils who have taken your fruit. I will not tell you who took part in
the raid, but I am sure of the fact since I was one.” Let us add that the
exceptional frankness of the youthful Gay-Lussac was not on this occa-
sion followed by any serious consequences. It won for him, on the con-
trary, the most marked affection of the superintendent and his wile,
who, from this time, lavished upon him truly parental care.

Gay-Lussae began the study of the Latin language under the diree-
tion of a priest who resided in Saint Leonard, for whom he always tes-
tified the sincerest attachment. That his taste for the noisy pastimes
of youth might not interfere with his desire to perform his duties, he
devoted a portion of the night to study, after playing all day with his
comrades. ;

The revolution of 1789, so legitimate in its objects, and which began
with so much grandeur and majesty, had ended by rushing into the
most deplorable digressions. The law against suspicious persons reached
Gay-Lussac’s father. The removal of this excellent man to Paris would
probably have been followed by his death. Our friend, filled with
alarm, repaired diligently to the club, which met in his native town.
to ascertain the slightest indication which could threaten his fath-
er. The sight of a strong and valiant youth inspired the leaders of
the epoch with a desire to enroll him in the army, then fighting the
140 EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC.

Vendeans. Gay-Lussae might gladly have donned the military capote
and shouldered his musket, but his filial affection prevailed; he proved
that, according to the letter of the law (he was but fifteen years of age)
he was exempt from joining the defenders of the republic, and he was
left undisturbed. After the ninth thermidor, Gay-Lussac’s father, who
had fortunately remained in the prisons of Saint Leonard, regained his
liberty. The first use he made of it was to devote himself to the future |
of the highly-gifted son, who, during his imprisonment, had given him
the most intelligent proofs of love. He placed him at M. Savouret’s
school in Paris.* This was in 1795. The scarcity and impossibility of
procuring food for his pupils induced M. Savouret to close his estab-
lishment. Gay-Lussac was soon after received into the boarding-school
of M. Sensier, which, established first at Nanterre and afterward at
Passy, outside of the walls of Paris, enjoyed some advantages of which
the schools of the capital were deprived at that time.

Ihave recently met in our assemblies old college-mates of Gay-Lussae,
and all have preserved the most pleasant recollections of him. One of
them, M. Darblay, a representative of the people, said to me, with feeling:
“He was the model of his school-fellows; we never saw him, notwith-
standing his uncommon spirit, give way toward any one to an impulse
of anger or impatience; as to his diligence, that was never relaxed.” A
pupil, taken to the theater by his friend, when asked at what hour he
returned, would reply: “I do not know, but it must have been very
late, as there was no light in Gay-Lussae’s chamber.” .

The difficulties under which M. Savouret had succumbed very soon
reached M. Sensier himself. Of all his pupils, he alone retained Gay-
Lussac, whose parents secretly were in the habit of sending him small
quantities of flour. Reduced to the most cruel extremities, Madame
Sensier every night carried to Paris, for sale, the milk of two cows, fed
in her garden, but the road being unsafe, Gay-Lussac begged and ob-
tained the favor of daily escorting his benefactress, armed with a large
sword suspended to his belt. It was during the return, which was made
by daylight, that our friend, stretched on the straw of the cart of the
impromptu milk-woman, studied geometry and algebra, thus preparing
himself for the examinations for the Polytechnic School, which he was
soon to undergo.

The sixth Nivése, year VI, after brilliant examinations, Gay-Lussae
received the much-coveted title of pupil of the Polytechnic School.
We sce him in this establishment always conversant with the required
duties, and giving during the hours of recreation private lessons to
young men who were intended for public services. 1t was in this way
he added small sums to the thirty franes that each pupil of the original
Polytechni¢ School reeeived as his monthly allowance, and that he sue-

who had any relations with our friend in his youih.

ceeded in maintaining himself in Paris without imposing fresh sacri-
fices on his family. 3

Gay-Lussace was one of the most distinguished of the scholars of the
Polytechnic School, as, at a later period, he was one of the most illustri-
ous and popular of the professors.

DEBUT OF GAY-LUSSAC IN CHEMISTRY—HE BECOMES COLLABORATOR

OF BERTHOLLET AND ASSISTANT PROFESSOR OF THE FOURCROY
COURSE—AERONAUTIC VOYAGE WITH M. BIRT.

Bertbollet, who had returned from Egypt with General Bonaparte,

requested, in 1800, a pupil fromthe Polytechnie School, whom he wished

to make his aid in the work of the laboratory. Gay-Lussac was this
privileged pupil. Berthollet suggested to him an investigation whose
results were diametrically opposite to those expected by the illustrious
chemist. I could not venture to affirm that Berthollet was not some-
what disturbed at finding himself mistaken in his predictions, but it is
certain that, unlike many other scientists whom I could name, after the
first impulse of vexation, the frankness of the young experimentalist
only served to increase the esteem that the author of Statice Chemistry
had already conceived for him. ‘Young man,” said he to him, ‘ your
destiny is to make discoveries; henceforth you shall be my collabora-
tor. I desire, and it is a title of which one day I am sure I shall be
able to boast, I desire to be your father in matters of science.”

Some time afterward, without giving up his position with M.
Berthollet, Gay-Lussac was chosen assistant professor of the Foureroy
course and often supplied Berthollet’s place, which soon gained him
the reputation, that was constantly growing, of one of the most distin-_
guished among the very able professors at that time collected at the
capital.

Man, by reason of his weight and limited muscular force, seemed con-
demned to move forever on the surface of the earth, and only to beable
to study the physical properties of the elevated regions of our atmos-
phere by painfully climbing to the summit of mountains; but what are
the difficulties over which genius allied to perseverance cannot triumph ?

A scientist, who was a member of this academy, Montgolfier, calcu-
lated that by rarefying, by means of heat, the air contained in a paper
balloon of limited size, he would obtain an ascensional force sufficient
to raise men, animals, and instruments of all kinds. This idea was
partially realized, June 1783, in the town of Annonai. The astonished
Parisian population saw, November 21, of that same year, the intrepid
voyagers, Pilatre de Roziers and d@’Arlandes, sail through the air, sus-
pended from a montgolfiére. Another physicist, whom the academy has
also numbered among its members, Charles, showed the possibility of
making balloons of a varnished material almost impermeable to hydro-
gen, the lightest of known gases, which could take the place of heated
142 EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAGC.

air with advantage. From his voyage made December 1, 1783, in com- —
pany with Robert the artist, in a balloon thus inflated, date ascensions —
infinitely less adventurous, and which in our day have become a pastime
for idlers.

It is to the original Academy of Sciences we must likewise go back,
if we wish to find one of the first scientifically useful ascensions made
with hydrogen-gas balloons.

It seemed to result from the experiments made during an ascension by |
Robertson and Lhoest at Hamburg, July 18, 1803, and renewed at St. Pe-
tersburg, under the auspices of the Imperial Academy of that city, by the
same Robertson and the Russian physicist, Saccharoff, June 30, 1804, that
the magnetic force which directs the needle at the surface of the earth
grew considerably weaker in proportion as they rose in the atmos-
phere. This fact, which confirmed the dimirution of this same force
that M. de Saussure supposed he had discovered in his celebrated jour-
ney to the Col du Géant, seemed to the principal members of the Insti-
tute, with good reason, to justify an especial experiment. This was:
confided to the physicists, Messrs. Biot and Gay-Lussac, both young,
enterprising, and courageous. ‘This last term may perhaps seem some-
what exaggerated to those who, in our day, have seen women, aping
in their costumes winged butterflies, placed entirely outside of the car
of the aerostat, rise from our public gardens, before the eyes of a won-
der-struck crowd. But such would forget that now balloons are con
structed with infinitely more care, and the means of safety have very
much increased.

Our two physicists ascended from the garden of the Conservatoire
des Arts et Metiers August 24, 1804, furnished with all the instruments
necessary for investigation, but the small dimensions of their balloon —
did not allow them to exceed a height of 4,000 meters. At this eleva-
tion they endeavored, with the aid of the oscillations of a horizontal
magnetic needie, to solve the problem which had been the chief object
of their ascension, but the rotary motion of the balloon presented unfore-
seen and serious obstacles. They succeeded, however, in partly sur-
mounting them, and they determined, in these aerial regions, the dura-
tion of five oscillations of the magnetic needle. It is known that this
duration must increase when the magnetic force which brings back the
needle to its natural position has decreased, and that this duration must
be shorter, as the same directing force has increased. It is therefore a
case entirely analogous to that of the oscillating pendulum, although
the motion of the needle is performed in a horizontal direction. The
consequences deduced from their experiments seem to me subject to
difficulties, which I shall point out after giving an account of the ascen-
sion made a few days later by Gay-Lussac alone.

EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC. 143

ASCENSION OF GAY-LUSSAC ALONE—CONSEQUENCES OF THE OBSER-
VATIONS MADE ON MAGNETISM AND TEMPERATURE—IMPORTANCE
OF AERONAUTIC VOYAGES.

This ascension took place September 16, 1804, at forty minutes after
nine in the morning. This time Gay-Lussac ascended to a height of
23,000 feet, 7,016 meters above the sea, the greatest well-authenticated
height that man had then succeeded in attaining, and which, since that
epoch, has been but once slightly exceeded by Messrs. Barrel and
Bixio.

This second ascension has enriched physics with several important
results, which I will endeavor to explain in a few words.

We find, for instance, that at the moment when Gay-Lussac’s ther-
mometer, at a height of 7,016 meters, indicated 9°.5 below the freezing
point, that of the Observatory of Paris, in the shade, and with a north-
ern exposure, stood at + 279.75. Therefore 37° was the extent of the
thermometrical scale to which Gay-Lussae found himself exposed during
the interval from 10 o’clock in the morning till 3 in the afternoon. It
was therefore no longer possible to attribute the perpetual snows exist-
ing on the summits of high mountains to any special action exerted by
those rocky summits on the surrounding strata of air, as no considera-
ble terrestrial elevation existed in the regions above which Gay-Lussac’s
balloon had successively passed.

Are these enormous variations of temperature connected in any way
by a simple mathematical law with the changes of height?

By taking as exact the thermometrical observations, about which
Gay-Lussac himself raises some doubts, on account of the rapidity of
the ascensional motion of the balloon, and the time required by a
thermometer to indicate exactly the temperature of the mediums into
which it is immersed, we would arrive at this curious result, that the
temperature would vary less for a given change of beight near the
earth than in the regions of the atmosphere of a mean elevation.

But I must remark that the ordinary manner of discussing aerostatic
observations leads us into a vicious circle. The analytical formula, by
means of which the successive heights of the balloon are calculated,
absolutely supposes, in fact, an equal abatement of temperature in
every region of the atmosphere for the same change of height. The
observations of 1804, and those subsequently made, will only give
results free from all objection when discussed according to the profound
method for which we are indebted to our ingenious and illustrious
associate M. Biot.

The difficulties might have been avoided if observers, furnished with
theodolites, and distributed at proper distances, had determined trigo-
nometrically by their combined observations the successive heights
of the balloon. Scientists and academies desiring to enter anew upon
144 _ EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC.

the scientific study of the physical constitution of our atmosphere will
certainly not fail to take my suggestions into serious consideration.

The hygrometer of de Saussure gave indications, during the ascension
of Gay-Lussac, of an irregular movement, but taking into account, at
the same time, the degrees indicated by this instrument and the tem-
perature of the strata in which it was observed, our associate found that
the amount of humidity containxed in the air continued to diminish with
extreme rapidity.

It was already known at the time of this memorable ascension that
air in all latitudes, and at a height very slightly above the level of the
sea, contained about the same proportions of oxygen and azote. This
resulted with proof from the experiments of Cavendish, Macarty, Ber-
thollet and Davy. It had also been ascertained by the analyses of The-
odore de Saussure, of air brought from the Col du Géant, that at the
height of that mountain the air contains the same proportions of oxy-
gen as that of the plain below.

The eudiometrical analyses of Gay-Lussac, made with the greatest
care, of air collected at a height of 6,636 meters, established the fact
that the air of those high regions was not only composed of oxygen and
nitrogen, like that at the surface of the earth, but, moreover, that it did
not contain an atom of hydrogen.

Jt is not necessary to insist here upon the importance of these results;
they showed the vagueness of the explanations given then by meteorolo-
gists of shooting-stars and other atmospheric phenomena.

The following extract from Gay-Lussac’s own narrative gives some
clew to a true explanation of the discomfort experienced by the most
robust travelers in climbing elevated peaks, such as Mont Blanc:

**On reaching the highest point of my ascension, 7,016 meters above
the mean level of the sea,” said the courageous physicist, ‘‘my respira-
tion was sensibly affected, but I was far from feeling yet a discomfort
sufficient to induce me to descend. My pulse and respiration were very
much accelerated; breathing very rapidly in air of extreme dryness, I
ought not to have been surprised that my throat was so dry that it was
impossible to swallow bread.”

Let us now pass on to the experiment which was the chief object of
the two aerostatic voyages, undertaken under the auspices of the
first class of the Institute. The question was, as I have previously
said, to assure themselves whether, as announced, the magnetic attrac-
tion exerted by the earth on a magnetic needle decreases very rapidly
with the height. Gay-Lussac succeeded, in this second ascension, in
counting, in a given time, twice as many oscillations as in the first.
The results must, therefore, furnish much greater exactness. He found
that a needle which at the surface of the earth required 42.2 to make
ten oscillations, at a height of 4.808 meters above Paris made the same
number of oscillations in only 428.8. The result was 428.5 at 5,631
meters, and 41%.7 at 6,884 meters. These numbers do not give much

EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC. 145

regularity; it would have been necessary, as Gay-Lussac himself
remarks, in order to deduce rigorous consequences, to combine them
with the corresponding measurements of the inclination, which could
not be effected.* Our friend, as M. Biot did, from the discussion
of the numbers collected in the first ascension, drew from his obser-
vations the conclusion that magnetic attraction is constant at all
accessible heights. This consequence was logical, at a period when
‘it was not generally known that, in a given place and under given cir-
cumstances, the duration of the oscillations of a magnetic needle is
influenced by its temperature, and that a decrement of the thermometer
of 37° must produce the most remarkable changes. We see that owing
to the imperfect state of the instruments, and of science in 1804, it was
impossible to arrive at an exact solution of the problem in question.
Moreover, it would be astonishing at the present time to hear that the
problem had been solved.

No considerations of any nature would authorize throwing a veil
over the gaps of science. This reflection especially concerns the works
of men whose authority is incontestable and uncontested.

Gay-Lussac, after having finished all his investigations with the calm-
ness and composure of a physicist seated in his laboratory, landed at
forty-five minutes after three o’clock, between Rouen and Dieppe, forty
leagues from Paris, near the hamlet of St. Gourgon, whose inhab-
itants executed with great readiness all the maneuvers directed by
the aerial voyager in order that the car should avoid the shocks that
would have placed the instruments in danger.

The dignity of this assembly and of the narrative should not, I
think, prevent my relating a singular anecdote, for which I am indebted
to my friend. Having reached a height of 7,000 meters Gay-Lussac
was desirous to rise still higher, and for this purpose rid himself of every
article not absolutely needed. Among these was.a white wooden chair,
which fell by chance into a bush near a young girl guarding some
sheep. What was the astonishment of the shepherdess, as Florian
might have said. The sky was pure, the balloon invisible. How
explain the chair, if it came not from paradise? The only argument
against this conjecture was the coarseness of the work; the workmen,
said the skeptics, must be very unskillful above. The dispute was at
this point when the journals, publishing the particulars of Gay-Lussac’s
voyage, put an end to it, and classed among natural effects what until
then had seemed to them a miracle.

The ascensions of M. Biot and Gay-Lussac will live in the memory of
men as the first which have been made with marked success for the
solution of scientific questions.

The very remarkable meteorological phenomena of a fall of the ther-

*Gay-Lussac succeeded in observing the dip of the needle, only at a height of
4,000 metres. He found there, in round numbers, 30°. This result, supposing it to
be exactly reported, differs immensely from the dip which takes place upon the earth.

mometer to 40° below freezing at a height of 7,049 meters, veriiied by
M. Bixio and M. Barrel during an ascension, undertaken at their own —
expense, July 27, 1850, clearly prove that glorious discoveries are —
awaiting those who will follow in their footsteps, provided they have ~
the necessary information and are furnished, as were these two phys-
icists, with a collection of exact instruments. It is sincerely to be
regretted that the ascensions, made almost every week, under circum-
stances more and more dangerous, and which, it may be painfully pre-
dicted, will end in some terrible catastrophe, have turned aside the
friends of science from their projected voyages. I can imagine their
scruples, but without sharing them. The spots on the sun, the mount-
ains in the moon, the ring of Saturn and ‘the belts of Jupiter have
never ceased to be objects of investigation to astronomers, although
now shown for ten centimes on the terre-plein of Pont-Neuf, at the foot
of the column of the Place Vendome, and at different points of our
boulevards. The public, now so discriminating and enlightened, would
not confound those who daily expose their lives for lucre, with physicists,
running the same risks to rob nature of some of its secrets.

ASSOCIATION OF GAY-LUSSAC WITH M. DE HUMBOLDT—WORK ON THE |
EUDIOMETER—TRAVELS IN ITALY AND GERMANY. |

However slightly conversant with the literary history of the first half _
of this century, all have heard of the warm and profound friendship of _
M. de Humboldt for Gay-Lussac, and of the influence it exerted over
the scientific career of the able chemist; but it is not so well known
how it originated and was developed, and this deserves to be related.

Before starting on the memorable journey which has made America |
known to usunder so many different aspects, M. de Humboldt prepared —
himself for it by diligent study. The object of one of his researches was
the eudiometrical means in use to determine the constituent principles
of air; this work, done in haste by an imperfect process, was somewhat
inaccurate. Gay-Lussac perceived this and criticised the error with an
alacrity that I would venture to condemn, if it were not rendered excu-
sable by the author’s youth. Itis unnecessary to mention that Berthollet —
received M. de Humboldt on his return with the frank cordiality and
well-bred politeness which characterized the illustrious chemist, and
which is engraved in indelible characters on the minds and hearts of all
who had the happiness of knowing him.

One day, M. de Humboldt remarked, among the company assembled
in the salon of the country-seat of Arcueil, a tall young man of modest
but dignified bearing. ‘ This is,” said some one to him, ‘ Gay-Lussac,
the physicst, who recently fearlessly ascended into the atmosphere to
the greatest height yet reached by man, to solve important scientific
questions.” ‘This is,” added Humboldt aside, “ the author of the sharp
criticisms on my eudiometrical work.” But soon mastering the sentiment —
of resentment, naturally inspired by such a reflection on a high-spirited

EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC. 147

nature, he approached Gay-Lussac, and, after some complimentary re-
marks on his ascension, extended his hand and affectionately offered
his friendship. It was, with due allowance, the Soyons amis, Cinna!
(Let us be friends!) of the tragedy, but without the mortifying reflections
which, as Voltaire relates, were made by the Maréchal de la Feuillade,
after having heard them for the first time. “Ah! Auguste, how you do
spoil the Soyons amis, Cinna!” Such was the origin of an attachment
that was never interrupted, and that soon bore the happiest fruits. We
see in fact, immediately afterward, the two new friends executing con-
jointly an important eudiometrical work.

This work, read atthe Academy of Sciences, the 1st Pluviése, year XIII,
had for its principal object an estimate of the exactness that could be ar-
rived at in an analysis of air with Volta’s eudiometer; but the authors at
the same time touched upon a multitude of questions relating to the
chemistry and physics of the earth, throwing great light upon them
and making very ingenious conjectures. It is in this memoir that the
remark is found (which has since received, at the hands of Gay-Lussac,
developments so important) that oxygen and hydrogen, considered in
volumes, unite to form water, in the definite proportion of 100 of
oxygen and 200 of hydrogen.

Our scientific annals present a large number of memoirs published
under the name of combined authors. This kind of association, much less
common abroad, is not without its drawbacks. If we except the very
rare case, of which however I[ could cite instances, where the part of each
collaborator was clearly defined in the joint editorship, the public is
obstinate in refusing an equal share to both associates. It frequently
dismisses, as caprice dictates, the formulas, we thought, we imagined, on
the very plausible pretext that the same -dea cannot present itself at
the same time to the minds of both associates. It refuses to one of
them all intellectual initiative and reduces his share to the mechanical
execution of the experiments.

These inconveniences of publishing in common, almost inherent in
human nature, disappear when, by way of exception, one of the asso-
ciates resolves not to indulge the public in its prejudiced and often
malicious surmises, by unhesitatingly disclaiming any part belonging
to the other. It was the good fortune of Gay-Lussac to meet with such
a collaborator. Here is, in fact, what I read in a note by M. de Hum-
boldt: ‘‘ Let us insist upon the remark contained in this memoir, that
100 parts in volume of oxygen require 200 parts in volume of hydrogen
gas for saturation. Berzelius has already reminded us that this phe-
nomenon is the germ of what was discovered later about definite pro-
portions, but the fact of complete saturation is due to the sagacity of
Gay-Lussac alone. I co-operated in this part of the experiments, but
he alone foresaw the importance of the result to the theory.” A decia-
ration so frank and loyal from this illustrious and venerable academician
will astonish no one.
148 EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC.

We will refer farther on to this very remarkable portion of Gay-Lus-
sac’s works. Gay-Lussac, assistant professor of the Fourcroy course,
obtained, through the friendly intervention of Berthollet, leave for a year
to accompany M. de Humboldt in his travels through Italy and Ger-
many. The two friends, before leaving Paris, provided themselves
with meteorological instruments, and especially apparatus suitable for
determining the inclination of the magnetic needle and the intensity of
the variable force which directs the magnetic needle in different lati-
tudes. They left Paris March 12, 1805, and experimented with their
instruments at Lyons, Chambéry, St. Jean de Maurienne, St. Michel,
Lanslebourg, and Mont Cenis, &c. I will return elsewhere to the
magnetic results of this journey in a memoir of our colleague inserted
in the collection of the Society of Arcuei]. Gay-Lussac had imbibed in
his youth the meteorological theories of Deluc, some of which had almost
captivated him, but in his passage over the Alps his ideas were entirely
modified. He felt the need, for example, of having recourse to the
action of ascending atmospheric currents to explain a large number of
curious phenomena.

Nothing enlightens and enlarges the ideas more, with regard to
natural phenomena, than traveling in mountainous regions, especially
when so fortunate as to enjoy the society of as cultivated, ingenious, ang
experienced an observer as M. de Humboldt.

Gay-Lussac and his illustrious fellow-traveler, after visiting Genoa,
went to Rome, where they arrived July 5, 1805, and alighted at the
palace Tommati alla Trinita di Monte, the residence of William de
Humboldt, chargé @affaires of Prussia.

In the society of him who has so eloquently described it, the grand
scenery of the Alpine regions could not fail to excite genuine enthusi-
asm in Gay-Lussac’s soul. The sight of the immortal monuments of
architecture, of the painting and sculpture with which Rome abounds,
joined to the learned conversations of the Rauches, Thorwaldsens, &c.,
habitués of the Tommati Palace, awakened in the youthful traveler a
taste for the fine arts, which until then had been latent. Finally he
enjoyed the advantage of admiring the fascination of talent ; for Madame
de Staél then held every salon of the Eternal City under the spell of her
eloquent and spirituel conversational powers. Gay-Lussac’s sojourn in
Rome was not without fruit to the science of chemistry. Thanks to the
courtesy of Morrichini in placing a chemical laboratory at the disposal
of the young traveler, he was able to announce, July 7, that fluoric acid
existed with phosphoric acid in the bones of fishes. July 9, he finished
the analysis of the alum rock of the Tolfa.

July 15, 1805, Messrs. de Humboldt and Gay-Lussac left Rome and
started for Naples, accompanied by M. Léopold de Buch, who, though
still young, had already distinguished himself by very valuable geologi-
cal researches. Vesuvius, in a state of rest at that period, suddenly
exhibited the most magnificent and terrible evolutions, (as if to celebrate

me _———_ _ -

EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC. 149

the welcome of the three illustrious observers ;) eruptions of dust, tor-
rents of lava, electrical phenomena, nothing was wanting.
Finally Gay-Lussac had the good fortune, (the expression is not mine ;

* I borrow it from one of the fellow-travelers of the learned chemist)—

he had the good fortune of being witness of one of the most frightful
earthquakes ever experienced at Naples.

Gay-Lussac eagerly seized this opportunity of coping with the prob-
lem which, since Empedocles, had defied the sagacity of observers. We
will soon give an account of the results collected by our friend in the

_ six ascensions of Vesuvius which followed each other in quick succession.

The time not devoted by Gay-Lussac to the study of the burning
volcano was employed in examining the collections of natural history,
and especially of former volcanic eruptions, which are found in great
numbers in Naples; our travelers had much reason to be gratified at
the kind attentions and exquisite politeness of the Duke de la Torre
and Colonel Pole; but such was not their experience with Dr. Thomp-
son. When they presented themselves, accompanied by a Neapolitan

scientist, to study his museum, he addressed them in these outrageous

words: ‘‘ Separate yourselves, gentlemen; I can keep my eyes on two,
but not upon four.” One feels tempted to ask from what society of
lazzaroni had Dr. Thompson borrowed sentiments so low and _lan-
guage so indecent; but all is explained when we learn that Thompson
was the physician, friend, and confidential agent of General Acton, the
instigator of the political assassinations which defiled Naples at the
close of the last century.

In his expeditions around Naples, by land and water, M. Gay-Lussae
corrected some erroneous ideas, then generally entertained. He found,
for example, that the air confined in sea-water contained, instead of 21
parts of oxygen, as ordinary air does, above 30 parts of oxygen for 100.
He visited Monte Nuovo and Epomeo with M. de Buch. On seeing
Monte Nuovo, Gay-Lussac fully adopted the opinion that M. de Buch
was then beginning to disseminate in the scientific world, according to
which mountains may suddenly spring out of the earth by means of
upheavals.

Epomeo seemed to them to have the characteristics of an abortive
volcano, without fire, or smoke, or crater of any kind.

After having finished their labors in Naples, our travelers returned
to Rome, where they remained but a short time. On the 17th of Sep-
tember, 1805, Messrs. de Humboldt, de Buch, and Gay-Lussae quitted
Rome to repair to Florence. They took the mountain road, in order to
visit the celebrated baths of Nocera, near which Popes Clement XII and
Benoit XIII had erected some real palaces, with all the necessary appli-
ances for invalids, who, from June until September, brought plenty into
the surrounding country.

- There an important problem was presented. Morrichini had found,
by chemical analysis, that air obtained from these waters contained 40
150 _ EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC.

per cent. of oxygen—that is to say, about double the proportion of the
same gas in atmospheric air, which seemed incredible. Gay-Lussac
discovered in reality that the air procured from the water of the baths
contained 30 per cent. of oxygen, a8 spring-water usually does. The
salutary effects of the waters must therefore be sought elsewhere, as they
were found so remarkably pure, no re-agent disturbed them. Is it this
purity that renders them so efficacious ?

In mythological times, heroes, celebrated by the Greek poets, roamed
desert countries to battle with the brigands and wild beasts they shel-
tered. Our travelers, as we see, seemed in their turn to have assumed
the mission of destroying by the way errors and prejudices, which often
make more victims than the monsters of antiquity exterminated by
Hercules, Theseus, Pirithéus, &e.

These scientists reached Florence September 22, and Fabbroni, super-
intendent of the museum, received them with the greatest distinction.
He did the honors of the rich collection, at the head of which the Tus-
can government had placed him, in a manner to prove how worthy he
was of the confidence he enjoyed. Gay-Lussac took great delight in his ©
society; he especially admired the knowledge and ability displayed by
Fabbroni in pointing out the merits of the productions of Michel Angelo
and of the illustrious painters and sculptors, successors of this great
man. He was not so much charmed with the learned director when, on
asking him the value of the inclination of the magnetic needle, Fab-
broni replied that the beautiful instruments which adorned the labora-
tory of the grand duke had not been used for fear of tarnishing the
metal. He did not enjoy either the reunions where Madame Fabbroni,
celebrated for the elegance and beauty of her poetry, the center of a
circle composed of the most distinguished society of Florence, was in
the habit of directing against every topic in succession flashes of wit
to which the individual addressed was obliged to reply at once and in
his best manner. These theatrical customs have happily disappeared
from among our neighbors to give place to conversations where each
freely takes the part which suits his position and even his timidity.

On the way from Florence to Bologna, where our three travelers ar-
rived safely September 28, they stopped at Piétra-Mala to study the per-
petual flames previously examined by Volta.

At Bologna Gay-Lussac visited Count Zambeccari, who had lost six
fingers by sliding along a rope to escape a catastrophe which was
threatening him, the montgolfiéré in which he had ascended into the
air having taken fire; his sufferings did not prevent his discussing with
Gay-Lussac a plan he had formed, and which, at a later period, was to
cost him his life—that of ascending again—but this time with a balloon
filled with hydrogen gas which he could heat more or less at will, by
means of a circle of lamps with a double draught of air. It will be
seen that the unfortunate aerial traveler was contriving in his new
scheme a method by which he would substitute the risks of explosion

EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAGC. 157

for those of the conflagration of his first attempt. Our travelers re-
mained but a short time in Bologna, whose university had then singu-
larly declined from its ancient reputation. The professor of chemistry
of this university, M. Pellegrini Savigny, had left no very favorable
impression upon Gay-Lussac’s mind; our colleague accused him of hav-
ing degraded the science by inserting in his Traité de Chimie (Treatise
upon Chemistry) methods of his own invention for preparing good sher-
bets and excellent soups for every day in the year.

Did not our friend indulge in some exaggeration in classing the sub- -
jects alluded to in the treatise of M. Pellegrini among those which
a scientist, who has any self-respect, should abandon to professional
charlatans? I will venture to say, in spite of my profound deference for
Gay-Lussac’s opinions, that he who should succeed in reducing to uni-
form and precise rules the preparation of our food, especially that of
the poorer classes, would solve an important hygienic question. I am
persuaded that some day posterity will manifest astonishment on learn-
ing that in the middle of the nineteenth century the alimentary regimen

‘of the masses was abandoned to empirics, of both sexes, without educa-
tion or intelligence.

Byron relatesin his memoirs, that during Sir Humphry Davy’s so-
journ in Ravenna, a fashionable woman expressed the desire that the
illustrious chemist should prepare for her a pomade to darken her eye-
brows and make them grow. I would unreservedly share the contemp-
tuous disdain with which our young friend would undoubtedly have
received such a proposition as this. But there is, it seems to me, a wide
difference between the pomade for the fashionable woman and formu-
las for improving the food of the people, and even that intended to sat-
isfy the sensuality of the rich.

Messrs. de Humboldt, de Buch, and Gay-Lussac reached Milan Octo-
ber 1. Volta was beni in that aie but they had ‘great difficulty in
finding him.

The civil and military administration of Milan, which ould not have
hesitated a moment if asked the address of a Seats Hungarian or Cro-
atian sublieutenant, of a contractor, or of any titled personage whatso-
_ ever, seemed utterly unmindful of Volta, that great man, the glory of
Lombardy; whose name will be uttered with respect and admiration
when the breath of time will have swept away even the slightest recol-
lection of generations of his contemporaries.

Let us turn aside from these several anomalies, a thousand instances
of which it would be easy to enumerate, and resume our narrative.

Our three young travelers learned in Milan that the scientific world
was alive with the rumor of a pretended discovery by M. Configliachi.
According to the Italian chemist, water was composed of muriatic acid
and soda, elements that the battery decomposed without difficulty.
Volta, consulted by our three travelers as to the merit of the observa-
tion, replied, ‘I have seen the experiment, but I do not believe in it.”
152 EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC.

It was in these terms the immortal physicist expressed the caution
which should meet all extraordinary facts similar to the pretended phe-
nomeuon by which his pupil Configliachi hoped to attain a great repu-
tation, The remark is peculiarly applicable to facts ascertained by in-
struments of a delicacy so extreme as to be influenced by the presence,
breath, and emanations from the body of the observer. The Voltaic
dictum, “‘I have seen it, but do not believe in it,” might have been ap-
plied on some recent occasions; it would have saved science some ret-
rograde steps, and certain authors unqualified ridicule.

On the 14th and 15th of October our travelers crossed Saint Gothard.
Gay-Lussae was denied the enjoyment of a spectacle from which he had
anticipated much pleasure and instruction, a thick fog concealing from
view even the nearest objects for a whole day. He compensated him-
self for this disappointment by a minute study of General Pfiffer’s fine
relief of Switzerland.

At Gottingen, November 4, the great naturalist Blumenbach, at that
time full of life and activity, cordially extended the honors of the uni-
versity to our young countryman.

On the 16th of the same month Gay-Lussac arrived at Berlin, where
he remained all winter under the roof of M. de Humboldt, kindly wel-
comed and appreciated by all the distinguished men of the city; he |
passed much of his time in the society of Klaproth, the chemist, and —
Erman, the physicist.

Gay-Lussac quitted Berlin in the spring of 1806. He very suddenly |
determined to leave on learning that the death of Brisson left a vacancy —
in the Institute, and that he might be chosen to fill the place of the
aged physicist.

In examining now the works of Gay-Lussac’s contemporaries who, in
1806, were in a position to contend with him for the vacancy in the
Academy of Sciences, it seems astonishing that his presence should
have been indispensable to his success; but it is that we forget that at
the end of the eighteenth century and beginning of the nineteenth no
one was a real physicist unless possessing a valuable collection of in-
struments well polished, well varnished, and arranged «in glass cases.
It was not without trouble that Gay-Lussac, who owned only a few in-
struments of research, succeeded in overcoming such prejudices. Let
us preserve these memories for the consolation of those who have ex-
perienced, or may in the future experience, disappointments in academic
elections.

GAY-LUSSAC’S RESEARCHES ON DILATATIONS.

A short time before Gay-Lussac, now a member of the institute, had
begun to apply his experimental talent to the study of the changes of —
the elastic force of gases with the temperature, and the formation and
diffusion of vapors, the same field of research had been explored in
England by an equally clever man, Dalton, numbered by the academy
among its eight foreign members. Dalton, although his genius was

EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAGC. 153

not unknown, to his countrymen, occupied in the small town of Kendal
the very humble and somewhat unprofitable position of private tutor of
mathematics, and had only at his command for his experiments imper-
fect instruments. There would then have been no impropriety in sub-
jecting his results to careful verifications. Gay-Lussac was not ac-
quainted with the works of the illustrious English physicist, as there
was no mention of them in the full and instructive account of the
experiments made by the physicists who had preceded him. Dalton

had found that air expands 0.392 in the interval between 0° and 100° of
the centigrade thermometer. Already, previously, as I had ascertained
from a printed document, Volta had given for this expansion 0.38.
Finally, in 1807, Gay-Lussac found it to be 0.875. This number was
generally adopted up to a recent period, and employed by all the
physicists of Europe.

According to the late determinations of Rudberg, and Messrs. Magnus
and Regnault, there was an error of about 1,4, in the value of the dila-
tation of air given by Gay-Lussac; our colleague never objected to
the number 0.3665 substituted by our fellow-laborer, M. Regnault, for
the number 0.375 which he had given. But what could be the real
cause of this difference? Gay-Lussac has never given any public ex-
planation of this disagreement. Not anticipating the catastrophe which
so suddenly removed him from us, I was guilty of the fault of not inter-
rogating him directly upon this subject.

It would not be uninteresting, however, to investigate how so careful
a physicist could allow himself to be drawn into such an error.

A German professor, celebrated for the importance of his discoveries,
M. Chladni, visited Paris some years since. Smarting under the diffi-
culties which he had encountered in all his investigations, he said in an
impressive tone and petulant manner, never to be forgotten, for in their
exaggeration they almost bordered upon the ridiculous: ** When you de-
sire to lift the smallest corner of the veil which envelopes nature, she
invariably exclaims “No! No! No!” M.Chladni might have added that
at the moment when it seems about to yield, it surrounds the observer
with snares into which the most skillful fall without suspecting it.

What could be the causes of error in the experiments of Volta, Dalton,
and Gay-Lussac that these illustrious physicists had not perceived? I
have heard it said that the drop of mercury designed to intercept com-
munication between the vessel in which the air was expanded and the
external atmosphere, leaving a slight space and giving passage to a
portion of the dilated air, was not displaced as much as it would have
been without that; but this cause would evidently have given too small
a co-efficient, and it was in the opposite direction, according to the recent
observations, that the number upon which Gay-Lussac had decided was
in fault. It was much more probable that the interior of the sides of

_ the vessel in which the celebrated academician operated were not suffi-
ciently dry; that the hygrometric vapor, adhering to the glass at low tem-
154 EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC.

peratures, evaporated when the apparatus was submitted to high temper-
atures; that it increased, therefore, without any means of detecting it, the
volume of the elastic fluid upon which they desired to operate. I point.
out this cause with the more confidence that it is now established that
the glasses, according to their composition, and even according to their
degree of annealing, are diversely hygrometrical; so that the degree of
heat which would cause complete desiccation in one of these glasses
would be insufficient when operating in another apparatus. Gay-Lussac
had perfectly understood the effect that hygrometric vapor should pro-
duce, and he attributed to this cause the errors of his predecessors.
Therefore, it was in following with a little more precaution in the paths
traced by our friend that this error of ;, imputed to him was discovered,
an error which could do no real injury to the just and legitimate repu-
tation for exactness which this learned physicist had acquired and which
subsequent works so fully justified.

When Gay-Lussae was occupied with the numerical determination of
the dilatation of elastic fluids by heat, our most skillful physicists thought
that different gases have different co-efficients. Witness, for example,
what Monge says, which I quote from his memoir on the composition of
water: “ Elastic fluids are not all equally dilatable by heat.” Gay-Lussac
found within the limits to which his experiments were confined that tbis
was an error. Since then there has been a return to the first opinion.
Indeed, it is almost a consequence of the fact verified by Davy, and espe-
cially by our colleague, M. Faraday, that gaseous bodies can be liquefied,
and under pressures different for each one of them.

SOCIETY OF ARCUEIL—MEMOIRS ON MAGNETISM—LAWS OF GASEOUS
COMBINATIONS—CATHETOMETER.

In 1807 Berthollet formed a private scientific society, composed of a
small number of individuals and called the Society of Arcueil, after the

commune, in the neighborhood of Paris, in which the country-seat of

this illustrious chemist was situated. Gay-Lussac, as may be readily
imagined, was one of the first members of the new society. Before pro-
ceeding further, let us say a few words about the criticisms to which this

kind of dismemberment of the first class of the institute formerly gave ~

rise. It was eminently flattering to young débutants in science to have
as chief judges and counselors in their labors men of European celeb-
rity, such as Laplace, Berthollet, Humboldt, &c. ; but could it be asserted
that preconceived ideas to which the cleverest minds more readily aban-
don themselves in an intimate reunion, so to speak, than before a pro-
miscuons public, had not a tendency to arrest the spontaneity of genius
and repress its researches below a conventional level? On the other
side, might not the desire to give evidence of fertility of mind, in the
presence of the most famous scientists, Sometimes lead enthusiastic
spirits to venture upon bold theories ?

Whatever may be thought of these doubts, which I mention with

EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC. 155

great hesitation, the independent and sober judgment of Gay-Lussac
would have placed him beyond influences which would not have been
called into play except under cover of eminent merit or fertility and of
imagination. His publications in the three volumes of the memoirs of
the Society of Arcueil deserve in every respect, from their variety, their
novelty, and also their exactness, to occupy the most distinguished place
in an impartial history of the sciences.

The first volume of the collection, published by the Society of Arcueil,
begins by a memoir in which Gay-Lussac has combined ‘the results of
all the magnetic observations made in conjunction with M. de Hum-
boldt, during the journey through France, Italy, and Germany, of which
we have already spoken at length. This branch of the science has for
some years been making very considerable progress, and yet we can confi-
dently recommend to physicists those pages on which Gay-Lussac has,
examined all the causes of error which may affect the measurements of
inclination and intensity, and the precautions to be taken to avoid them.
We know now that the horizontal force which directs the magnetic
needle is subject to a diurnal variation which depends in part, but only
in part, upon a corresponding variation in the inclination. We have
likewise learned that in a given place and at a given time the duration
of the oscillations of a needle depends upon its temperature. It would
therefore be now necessary, if a magnetic voyage were undertaken, to
take into account all of these disturbing causes; but, and we can say
it without flattery, at the period when it was published, the work of
Messrs. de Humboldt and Gay-Lassac was a model.

If we cast our eyes over the second volume of the Memoirs of Arcueil,
we will find there, among other clever works of interest—a Memoire sur
la Combinaison des Substances Gazeuses entre elles, “ Memoir on the com- ©
bination of gaseous bodies with each other.” This memoir contains re-
sults so remarkable, so important, that they are habitually called the
laws of Gay-Lussac. It would now be very difficult for me to give a
detailed and perfectly accurate account of the atomic theory. This
sketch should, I think, go back as far as Higgins, an Irish chemist,
whose work, published in 1789, is only known to me through very
short quotations by Humphry Davy. Then come the researches of
Dalton in 1802. It is a matter of certainty that the law of volumes
was demonstrated experimentally by our associate in 1808, without any
knowledge on his part of the first more or less systematic investigations
of his predecessors.

The laws to which we have alluded may be announced in these terms:

Gases, in acting upon each other, combine in volume in the simplest
ratios; such as 1 to 1, 1 to 2, or 2 to 3. Not only do they only unite in
these proportions, but again, the apparent contraction of volume which
sometimes occurs by the combination bears also a simple ratio to the
volume of one of the combined gases. Gay-Lussac, later, had the bold-
ness to deduce from his laws the density of the vapors of several solid
156 EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC.

bodies, such as carbon, mercury, and iodine, integral parts of certain
gaseous combinations. This boldness, as proved by subsequent exper-
iments, was crowned with perfect success.

Recently it was thought possible to deduce from the unequal dilata-
tion of different gases by heat the proof that the law of volumes is not

mathematically exact. Let us suppose, the learned critics sayimplicitly, _

that two gases combine in equal volume and at a fixed temperature—
for example, that of 20° centigrade—and that the combination is made
molecule by molecule let us carry to 40° the temperature of the two
gases. If at 20° equal volumes contain the same number of elementary
particles, such would not be the case at 409." There will then be unequal

volumes which will enter into combination, supposing that the union ~_

must always be effected molecule by molecule. It will be seen that the
criticism implies the absolute truth of the atomic theory of combination,
which, by the way, may seem not so firmly established as the law of
Gay-Lussac. Besides, would not that have been a very singular coin-
cidence which should have led our colleague to operate precisely at the
temperatures at which this law should be rigidly exact?

Let us remark, in point of fact, that in the study of nature it has

rarely happened that experiment has led, through some light devia- —

tions, to simple laws, unless these laws have become the definite regu-
lators of the phenomena. The system of the earth offers a striking

example of this truth. The laws of the elliptical movement of the © |

planets are only exact by disregarding the irregularities known under
the name of perturbations, and which place each planet sometimes in
advance, sometimes behind the position assigned to it by the immortal
laws of Kepler.

' Tf it is ever established by direct experiments that the principles laid
down by Gay-Lussac are not confirmed when the temperatures come to
vary, it will be the time to investigate whether there be not a natural
cause to which these perturbations may be attributed.

In the limited compass assigned me I could only present simple doubts
on the nice question I have ventured to broach; at all events, the assimi-
lation which they have suggested to me seems of a nature to satisfy the

most enthusiastic partisans of the scientific glory of Gay-Lussac. When —

Laplace, looking at capillary phenomena in a new light, desired to com-
pare the results of his skillful calculations with those of observation,
and when he wished the subject to have the final seal of experiment, he

applied to Gay-Lussae. The latter fully responded to the confidence of ©

the immortal geometer. I should add that the instrument which he
invented is of small dimensions—the same, under the name of cathe-
tometer, now so generally in use among physicists. I leave to those
who consider they have the right, the responsibility of laying claim to
priority in the use of the word cathetometer now generally adopted ;
but the instrument in principle and even in form will not the less remain

one of the valuable inventions with which our colleague has endowed —

WORKS ACCOMPLISHED BY MEANS OF THE BATTERY OF THE POLY-
TECHNIC SCHOOL.

We have now reached the period when, treading in the path so suc-
cessfully opened by Nicholson and Carlisle and followed by Berzelius
and Hisinger, Sir Humphry Davy succeeded, by means of the battery,
in transforming potash and soda into metals which could be kneaded
with the fingers, like wax; which float on the surface of water, because
lighter than it, and which ignite spontaneously in this liquid, diffusing
the brightest light.

The announcement of this brilliant discovery, at the close of 1807,
created a profound sensation in the scientific world. The Emperor
Napoleon took part in it, and placed at the disposal of the Polytechnic
School the fund necessary for the erection of a colossal battery. While
this powerful instrument was being constructed, Messrs. Gay-Lussac
and Thénard, to whom it was to be confided, conceiving that ordinary
affinity, well directed, would suffice for the production of potassium and
sodium, attempted various very dangerous experiments, and succeeded
beyond their expectations. Their discovery was published March 7,
1808. From this time the two new metals, which were only obtained in
very small quantities by the battery, could be produced in great abun-
dance, and thus became the usual instrument of chemical analysis.

As may be easily imagined our two celebrated countrymen did not
allow the means of investigation they had just so skillfully prepared
to remain idle in their hands. They placed the potassium and sodium in
contact with nearly all known chemical substances, and noticed, during
the experiment, the reactions most fertile in theoretical consequences.
We will content ourselves by citing here the decomposition of the acid
formerly known as boracic, and the discovery of its radical, called by
its discoverers boron. We must likewise rank very high in their inves-
tigations the very difficult and varied experiments by which they deter-
mined the actions exerted by the two new metals on ammonia; the
results of their work on fluoric acid, now called fluobydric, and the
discovery of the new gas which they named fluoboric. Following the
chain of their researches, the two illustrious chemists were led to
attempt the analysis of the substance then denominated oxygenated
muriatic acid; they made known the results of their numerous experi-
ments February 27,1809. Their communication finished with this para-
graph, which I transcribe literally: “‘ According to the facts reported in
this memoir, it might be supposed that this gas (oxygenated muriatic
acid gas) is a simple body. The phenomena which it presents are suffi.
ciently well explained in this hypothesis; we do not seek, however, to
vindicate it, because it seems to us that they are explained still better
by regarding oxygenated muriatic acid gas as a compound body.”
_ They made by this declaration a large concession in favor of the pre-
vailing opinions of the Society of Arcueil ; to those supported with
158 EULOGY-ON GAY-LUSSAC.

great warmth by Laplace and Berthollet. Sir Humphry Davy, who |

was in no wise constrained by personal considerations, maintained that

the first interpretation alone was admissible; he regarded oxygenated

muriatic acid as a simple body, that Amperé proposed to call chlorine ;
common muriatic acid became then the combination of this radical with
hydrogen, under the name of hydrochloric, or chlorohydriec acid. This
manner of interpreting facts is now generally adopted.

It is seen by this example that there are cases where the counsels of
genius, when they assume the imperious character that counsels should
never have, may sometimes lead the squndest minds astray from truth.

When the colossal battery constructed with the funds granted the ~
Polytechnic School by Napoleon was finished, Messrs. Gay-Lussae |

and Thénard were eager to study its effects, but less energy was shown
than was expected. So after various trials, without striking results
the two illustrious chemists confined themselves to laying dewn gen-
eral principles on the mode of action of these apparatus when they
exceed the usual dimensions. We find in their work a chapter in which

they examined the different causes which create a variation in the energy -
of the galvanic battery, in which they give the means of measuring its —

effects, and in which they study theinfluence exerted by the liquid con-

tained in the troughs, according to its nature and the variations of in-

tensity which may depend upon the number and surface of the plates’ —

employed. ;
ANALYSIS OF ORGANIC MATTER.

The analysis of animal and vegetable substances for some years has
received immense developments and led to the most important results.

This progress of the science is chiefly due to a method invented by Gay- q

Lussac to effect organic analyses, and which has been adopted by all

chemists. Our colleague burned the substance to be analyzed with the ~
binoxide of copper. This process was a great improvement upon the

one he used with his associate and friend M. Thénard, in which combus-
tion was effected by means of oxymuriate of potash, now known as
chlorate of potash.

RESEARCHES ON IODINE.

M. Courtois, a manufacturer of saltpeter in Paris, discovered, about
the middle of 1811, in the ashes of varec a solid substance which cor-
roded his boilers, and which since, at the suggestion of Gay-Lussace,
has been called iodine, from the extremely remarkable violet color of its
vapor. M.Courtois sent samples of this substance soon after its discov-
ery to Messrs. Desormes and Clément, who made it the subject of exper-
iment. M. Clément did not make public M. Courtois’s discovery, and
the results he had obtained conjointly with M. Desormes, until the meet-
ing of the first class of the institute, December 6, 1813. Sir Humphry
Davy, who, on account of his scientific genius, had obtained from the
Emperor especial permission to pass through France, was then in Paris.

EULOGY -ON GAY-LUSSAC. 159

Hereceived from M. Clément, a short time after his arrival, numerous sam-
ples of the mysterious substance. M.Gay-Lussac learned this, and saw
at a glance what mortifying criticisms affecting the honor of our exper-
imentalists and academies might arise from resigning the priority, the
result of chance and thoughtlessness, to the investigations of a foreign
chemist. He went immediately to rue du Regarda, to the poor workman,
obtained a small amount of the matter discovered by him, set himself
to the task, and produced in a few days a work equally remarkable for
the variety, the importance, and the novelty of the results. The iodine,
under the searching eye of our colleague, became a simple body, fur-
nishing a peculiar acid by combining with hydrogen, and a second acid
by uniting with oxygen. The first of these acids proved, by a new exam-
ple, that oxygen was not the only acidifying principle, as was believed
for a long time. This work of Gay-Lussac upon iodine was subse-
quently completed; and there are found in a very long and beautiful
memoir, read August 1, 1814, and published among those of the acad-
emy, the varied results of the investigations of our colleague.

Every chemist who has read this work admires in it the fertility of
the author in varying experiments, and the soundness of judgment
which always guides him when necessary to interpret them and draw
| from them general consequences. In several chapters of this very
' remarkable work the author dwells especially upon the analogy which
he establishes between chlorine, iodine, and sulphur, which throws
great light upon several branches of the science then involved in
obscurity.

DISCOVERY OF CYANOGEN.

Prussian blue, a substance known to manufacturers and painters, had
been the subject of the researches of a large number of scientists,
among whom we will chiefly cite the academician Macquer, Guyton
de Morveau, Bergman, Scheele, Berthollet, Proust, and M. Porrett.

Guy-Lussac, in his turn, entered the lists. His results are recorded
in a memoir which was read before the first class of the Institute Sep-
tember 18, 1815. From this moment everything doubtful became a
certainty ; light succeeded obscurity. This memoir, one of the most
- beautiful of which science can boast, revealed a multitude of new facts
of immense interest to chemical theories. Those who will read it with
care will see at the cost of what fatigue, with what precautions, what
sobriety in the deductions, what soundness of judgment, an observer
succeeds in avoiding false steps, and bequeathing to his successors a defi-
nitive work; I mean a work which subsequent investigations will not
essentially modify.

In that admirable memoir, the aathor first gives an exact analysis of
the acid which enters into the composition of Prussian blue, and which
was called by Guyton de Morveau prussic acid, but which was never
obtained, until the work of our friend, in a state of purity, but mixed
only with water. _ He then showed how he succeeded in separating the
160 EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC.

radical from prussie acid, which has since been denominated cyanogen. |
He established the fact that cyanogen is a compound of azote and ear-
bon; that prussic acid is definitively formed from hydrogen and this rad-
ical; and that it should take the name of hydrocyanic acid, for which —
chemists now often substitute that of cyanhydric acid. He points out
with the greatest care its reactions on a great number of substances,
simple or compound, solid or gaseous. He makes known the combina- —
tion of cyanogen with chlorine, which should naturally bear the name
of chloro-eyaniec acid. In briet, in this work Gay-Lussac filled a gap in
chemistry by showing that there exists a combination of azote and —

carbon. He proved that cyanogen, although a compound, plays the —

part of a simple body in its combinations with hydrogen and metals, — |
which, at the period when our colleague wrote, was the sole example in ~

the science. I have said that, to establish results so grand, Gay-Lus-

sac displayed indefatigable perseverance. If proof of it is wanted, I —
will mention, for instance, that, wishing to know what modifications —
electricity could produce in a mixture of two gases, he passed into it
at least fifty thousand sparks. |

We read with great regret, in the memoir of our colleague, the follow-.
ing paragraph: “I had indulged the hope, in devoting myself to these

researches, of being able to throw some light on all the combinations of

hydrocyanie acid; but the duties I have to perform have forced me
to interrupt them before they had reached the degree of perfection to
which I expected to bring them.” What were these duties which, in
1815, hindered Gay-Lussac from completing this work of genius? It
was—and I mention it with regret—the necessity of providing for his —
family, by giving public lectures almost daily, which consumed the |
time our friend had wished to devote more usefully to the advance- —
ment of science. .

Cyanogen, one of the constituent principles of Prussian blue, furnishes,

by combining with hydrogen, a poison so subtile that a celebrated phys-
iologist, the first to use it in experiments on living animals, exclaimed, —

on seeing its effects, ‘‘ Henceforth one may believe all that antiquity

has said of Locusta.” The same learned academician has proved by —

his experiments that in the poisoned animals no lesion in the organs |

essential to life is seen. -

This action of the liquid obtained for the first time by Gay-Lussae it
will appear the more mysterious from the fact that it is produced by a —
substance composed of azote, one of the constituent principles of atmos- —

pheric air, of hydrogen, one of the constituent principles of water, and
carbon, whose innocuousness is proverbial. One more reflection, and I

have done with this article. Chemists never fail, when they discover a —
new product, to describe its taste. Who does not think with horror that

if he had not departed from the usual custom, if he had placed one ne |

single drop of this liquid on his tongue, our friend would have fallen a

instantaneously, as if struck by a thunderbolt. The odor of bitter
almonds which is exhaled, it is said, by the dead bodies of animals that
have perished from the effects of hydrocyanic acid, would then have
given no clue to the cause of this national Paeleerple:

‘SIPHON BAROMETER—MANNER IN WHICH CLOUDS ARE SUSPENDED—
STORM-CLOUDS—DIFFUSION OF GASES AND VAPORS—CENTRAL HEAT
OF THE GLOBE.

Gay-Lussac published, in 1816, the description of a portable siphon
barometer, now so widely spread, especially since the improvements
made in it by the artist Bunten.

This is not the only service rendered to meteorology byour friend. In
a note inserted, in 1822, in the twenty-first volume of the Annales de

| Chimie et de Physique, iene of Chemistry and Physics,) he has ex-
plained his views on the manner in which clouds are suspended. On
looking at the ascensional motion that the ascending atmospheric cur-

rent gives to soap-bubbles, evidently heavier than the air, he thought
he might attribute the suspension of vesicular molecules to this same
current, at much more considerable elevations.

Before this epoch, in 1818, in a letter addressed to M. de Humboldt,
Gay-Lussac had investigated the causes of the formation of storm-clouds.

According to him, the electricity constantly diffused in the air suffices

to explain the phenomena presented by this kind of cloud. When the

storm-clouds are of great density, they possess the properties of solid

bodies; the electricity originally disseminated in their masses rises
to the surface where it has considerable tension, by virtue of which it
can overcome, at times, the pressure of the air and dart forth in long
flashes, either from one cloud to another, or over the surface of the

‘earth. It will be seen how greatly these views differ from those of

Volta, the master of everything connected with electricity. Whatever
be the opinion pronounced upon the rival theories, it must be acknowl-
edged that in the discussion of what Gay-Lussac calls his conjectures,
he has shown himself a very skillful logician and perfectly familiar with
the most subtile properties of the electric principle.

Among the researches of our friend, designed to throw light upon the

nicest points of meteorology, we must also mention those which concern

vaporization and the dissemination of vapors, either on empty spaces

or in spaces containing aeriform fluids.

I perceive that I shall scarcely be able to say even a few words about
Gay-Lussac’s views with regard to voleanic phenomena. These opin-
ions were published in 1823, under the title of Réflexions, in a memoir in-
serted in the twenty-second volume of the Annales de Chimie et de Physique.
The author does not believe that the central heat of the earth, if that heat

exist, contributes at all to the production of voleanic phenomena. These
| phenomena, according to him, are owing to the action of water, probably

$s 11
162 EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC.

sea- water, on combustible substances. According to this hypothesis, the a

torrents of gaseous matter which issue from the craters of voleanoesshould

contain a great deal of hydrogen and hydrochloric aeid. The manner in
which the authorexplains the absence of hydrogen in these aeriform ema-
nations, and the processes which he points out to such men as Monte-
celli, Cavelli, and other scientific observers, suitably placed to ascertain
the existence of hydrochloric acid, must be sought in the original me-
moir. Ido not think that this memoir, in spite of its ingenuity, has
solved the so much controverted question of voleanic phenomena. But
I will in this case simply imitate the reserve of Gay-Lussac, who mod-
estly said in beginning his memoir, “I do not possess the extent of in-
formation (in geology) required to treat such a subject. I shall merely
skim lightly over its surface.”

SERVICES RENDERED TO THE INDUSTRIES BY GAY-LUSSAC—ALCOHOL-
METER—ALKALIMETER—MANUFACTURE OF SULPHURIC ACID—AS-
SAY OF GOLD AND SILVER BULLION.

According to the logical and unavoidable consequences deduced from
the language of certain biographers, whose merits, in other respects, it
gives me pleasure to acknowledge, the young man who devotes himself
to science, particularly when brilliant success has marked his first steps,
surrenders by so doing his personal freedom. In fact, they not only
sometimes examine what those whose history they are writing have
done, but claim to be able to determine what they should have done, at
@ period, too, when for want of inspiration they have felt, for the sake
of their dignity and fame, the need of rest. In this examination they
disregard the fatigue induced by age, the infirmities resulting from it,
and family obligations, all as sacred to the man whose life is given up to
study as to any other citizen.

Gay-Lussac has not escaped the consequences of this somewhat cen-
surable manner of criticising. It has pleased some to divide the career
of our colleague into two distinct phases: the first devoted to the spec:
ulative study of natural phenomena, the second entirely confined to:
the applications from which he was to realize substantial benefits.

In this second phase, which they claim fades into insignificance, if it is
not diminished in importance by comparison with the first, Gay-Lussac,
enjoying the favor of the government, was selected in succession to.aid
by his scientific knowledge in the manufacture of gunpowder; to act
as adviser in the administration of the excise; to manage the assay
office become vacant by the death of Vauquelin, &e.

The invention of new processes, characterized by exactness, simplicity,.
and elegance, proves what a slave Gay-Lussac was to his duties, and
that the government could not have bestowed its confidence more
judiciously.

The academy, called upon to pronounce upon the merits of the:

EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC. 163

alcoholmeter in every-day use, with our colleague, adopted, June 3, 1822,
a report, concluding as follows: _

“Tt is obvious, in brief, that M. Gay-Lussac has treated the subject
of areometry under every aspect, and with his accustomed skill. The
tables he has deduced after a tedious toil of more than six months, will
be a valuable acquisition to the industries and sciences ; the authorities
will find in them also, as he hoped, the means of improving and simpli-
fying the collection of taxes, and the safest guide they can follow.”

As fertile in the invention of industrial methods as in the discovery
of scientific truths, one after the other, as if by enchantment, Gay-Lus-
sac created chlorometry, invented methods for determining the richness
of the alkalies of commerce, contrived ingenious means by which the
manufacture of sulphuric acid has become less expensive, and has no

_ longer need to be brought from unfrequented places } and he crowned

this series of important works by the discovery of a process which has
been substituted in all civilized countries for cupellation, an ancient and
defective method for analyzing alloys of silver and copper. Truly, I
ask myself, with what theoretical speculations could Gay-Lussac have
better filled the second phase of his career, since phase there is, than
by producing works which to their scientific merits add the advantage
of being susceptible of positive and multiplied applications, which serve
as safe guides to the natural industries and to enlighten the public au-

_thorities ?

To pretend to confine men of genius to the path of pure abstraction,
and to forbid discoveries which may be useful to the human race, would
be to yield to the most erroneous ideas, in my opinion. And besides, do
you wish to know to what you expose yourself when you decide, ac-
cording to preconceived ideas, what a scientist could do, or should have

done?

Gay-Lussac, in your opinion, was in the enjoyment of excellent

_ health, and should have been able, as a septuagenarian, to manifest

the ardor, activity, and fertility of intellect of his youth, and a cruel
event has proved to you that he bore in his bosom the germ of the dis-
ease which carried bim off so unexpectedly to scientific Europe.

You thought him entirely absorbed in conducting his business affairs,
and at that very time he was constructing, at great expense, in his
country-seat, a laboratory which might serve as a model for those
chemists who, for themselves or for the public, may have to direct the
construction of establishments of the same kind.

Our colleague was represented as exclusively preoccupied with the
lucrative applications of science, at a period when, concentrating his
faculties to meditate upon numerous and different theories, he was
writing the first chapters of a work, which unfortunately he did not
finish, entitled Philosophie Chimique, (Chemical Philosophy.)

. Lhope, after these few words, the biographers whose opinions have
rendered this digression necessary, will feel, on such occasions, the ne-
164 EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC.

cessity of confining their explanations simply to the scientific produc. —
tions which have been submitted to the public, and of remaining silent
about those with which, according to their judgment, the scientist —
should have enriched the world. It is almost preaching ingratitude to
posterity. '

I should add that the illustrious savants, whose opinions on a special _

point I have thought it my duty to combat, would likewise like to limit _
these biographies to purely technical analysis; they would discard
everything which concerns the sentiments of the man and the citizen. —
They allege that details of private life (they call them anecdotes, with
a desire to stigmatize them with absolute censure) ought not to be pre- ,

served in our academic archives. When, without pretending to show, _
as night reasonably be done, any comparison between the productions

of the early secretaries and my own humble biographies, I reminded
these aristarchs of the very interesting portraitures contained in the 4
admirable eulogies of Fontenelle and Condorcet, they replied that a
everything is good in its time, that the progress of knowledge has ren-
dered the modifications they demand indispensable. I do not share ©
these opinions, notwithstanding the respect due the savants who com- 3
mend them. c|

I regard as an essential part of the mission I have to fulfill an inves-
tigation into whether the associates whom we have had the misfortune i
to lose have caused the worship of science and that of integrity to —
keep pace with each other; whether they have, as the poet expresses if, —
allied fine talents to a fine character. Nevertheless, in such matters —
the public is the only competent judge; I will wait until it has made
known its sovereign decision, and unreservedly yield obedience to it.

GAY-LUSSAC AS PROFESSOR—HIS LABORATORY—HIS WOUNDS—SIM- —
PLICITY OF HIS MANNERS.

I am going, therefore, without further explanation, to take the liberty
of introducing you into those amphitheaters where our colleague de- |
lighted with his eloquence a large and brilliant audience. We will then
pass into his laboratory ; I will even collect various anecdotes, (you see
I do not hesitate to use the word,) from which an estimate may be |
formed, from a new point of view, of the full extent of the loss which _
the academy has sustained.

In a discussion among the learned to decide whether a treatise on the —
world was or was not by Aristotle, Daniel Heinsius decided in the
negative, and the following is his principal argument: * The treatise in
question presents none of that majestic obscurity which, in the works
of Aristotle, repels the ignorant.”

Gay-Lussac would assuredly never have obtained encomiums from |
the Dutch philologist, for he always approached his object by paths the |
most direct, the most distinct, and with the least parade. ¢

Gay-Lussac, on all occasions, showed his profound dislike for those —
ostentatious phrases into which his first titular professor, notwithstand-

EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC. 165

ing his well-merited celebrity, often allowed himself to be drawn, and
in which the most pompous words were found side by side with such
technical expressions as ammonia, azote, carbon. His language and
style were grave, correct, nervous, always perfectly adapted to the sub-
ject and characterized by the mathematical spirit which he had imbibed
in his youth at the Polytechnic School. He had the power, as others
had, of exciting astonishment in his audience by presenting himself be-
fore it without any manuscript notes in his hand; but he would have
run the risk of using erroneous figures, and exactness was a merit which
touched him most nearly.

Gay-Lussac’s knowledge of the foreign languages, Italian, English,
and German, enabled him to enrich his lectures with erudition of the
purest kind, and drawn from the original sources. He it is who has
initiated our own chemists and physicists into several theories originat-
ing on the right bank of the Rhine. In brief, Gay-Lussac, who has not
been surpassed by any contemporary chemist in the importance, novelty,
and brillianey of his discoveries, has also indisputably occupied the first

rank among the professors of the capital upon whom devolved the task

of teaching the sciences at the Polytechnic School.

On entering Gay-Lussac’s laboratory every one was struck, at the first
glance, with the intelligent order which reigned everywhere. The ma-
chines and different utensils, for the most part prepared by his own
hands, were remarkable for the most careful conception and execution.
You will pardon me these details, gentlemen. If, as Buffon has said,
“Style makes the man,” we might add with not less reason thatthe great
chemist and good physicist are recognized by the condition of the ap-
paratus which they use. Imperfections in the operation are always more
or less reflected by the results.

When the chemist operates upon new substances and combinations
with unknown reactions, he is exposed to real and almost inevitable dan-
gers. Gay-Lussac realized this but too truly. During his long and
_ glorious scientific campaigns, he was seriously wounded on several dif-
ferent occasions; the first time, June 3, 1808, by potassium, prepared
in large quantities by a new method. Messrs. de Humboldt and Thé-
nard led our friend with his eyes bandaged from the laboratory of the
Polytechnic School, where the accident occurred, to his house rue des
Poules, which, by the way, it would be well to call rue Gay-Lussac. In
spite of the prompt attention of Dupuytren, he lost the lachrymal
glands and thought himself perfectly blind for a month. This disheart-
ening prospect for a man of thirty was borne by our friend with a calm-
ness and serenity that the stoics of antiquity might have admired.

‘For nearly a year,” said Madame Gay-Lussace, (in a note she had the
goodness to send me,) ‘‘ the reflection from a small night-lamp before
which I placed myself to read to him, was the only light he could en-
dure. During the rest of his life his eyes remained red and weak.”

The last explosion of which Gay-Lussac was the victim, took place at
a period of his life when misinformed individuals declared him to be

”
166 EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC.

idle. Our friend was busy with the study of the carbureted hydrogens ~
proceeding from the distillation of oils. The glass balloon containing —
the gases, and which had been set aside for several days, was taken by
M. Lariviére, a young chemist, to be submitted to Gay-Lussac’s inspec- |
tion. While our colleague was absorbed in the minute examination
necessary to give the projected experiments the desirable precision, a
frightful explosion took place, the cause of which, even to this day, is
not perfectly understood, which completely shattered the balloon. Such
was tne velocity of the fragments of glass, that they made on the win-
dow-panes of the laboratory clear holes without the trace of a fissure, as
if by projectiles from fire-arms. Gay-Lussac’s eyes, which were but a
few centimeters (not more than an inch) from the balloon, this time es-
caped all injury; but one of his hands was seriously wounded, and
required long and painful treatment. Some persons saw in this terrible
wound the original cause of the painful disease to which our friend suc-
-cumbed a few years afterward.

The members of the academy, who went daily to visit him on his bed
of suffering, heard him with emotion congratulate himself that the
wounds of his young friend and assistant, M. Lariviére, were insignifi-
cant, and on this occasion his own life alone had been endangered.

Some have desired to regard these accidents as the consequences of
negligence and thoughtlessness ; say, rather, by a comparison whose ap-
propriateness will be recognized by all who know our friend, that if he
were often wounded it was because he was often under fire, and that
he did not hesitate to examine things very closely, even when there
was great danger in doing so. It has been thought the successes of
Gay-Lussac in his scientific researches only afforded him that calm satis-
faction which the discovery of some new truths must naturally produce.
Appearances were deceitful. To protect himself from the dampness of
the laboratory, which was on the ground floor, Gay-Lussac usually wore
sabots over his shoes. Pelouze, one of his favorite pupils, told me that |
after the success of an important experiment he had frequently seen
him through the half-open door of his study give signs of the liveliest
pleasure, and even dance in spite of his clumsy wooden shoes.

This reminds me of an anecdote which I will borrow from my friend

Sir David Brewster, simply, I confess, that it affords me the opportu-
nity of connecting the name of Gay-Lussae with that of the immortal
scientist of whom Voltaire, without being charged with exaggeration,
has said:

Confidants of the Supreme, creatures of immortal life,

Ye who burn with fire divine, and your wings with glory rife,

Spread around your Master’s throne, can you, from your stations high,

View great Newton here below undisturbed by jealousy ?

Confidents du Trés-Haut, substances éternelles,

Qui brilez de ses feux, qui couvrez de vos ailes

Le tréne ot votre maitre est assis parmi vous,

Parlez: du grand Newton n’étiez-vous point jaloux ?

In 1682 the great Newton, turning into account the dimensions of
the earth, obtained by Picard, of this academy, renewed a calculation

é

EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC. 167

-which he had before attempted, but without success, according to the
former determinations of Norwood. His object was to ascertain whether
the force which retains the moon in its orbit and prevents its escaping

’ in a tangent by virtue of the centrifugal force, was not the same as that
which causes bodies to fall at the surface of the earth, diminished only
in the ratio of the square of the distances measured from the center of
our globe. This time the numerical calculation justified the anticipa-
tions. The great man experienced such delight, this coincidence pro-
duced so much nervous excitement, that he was incapable of verifying
his numerical calculation, as simple as it was, and found himself obliged,

for the purpose, to have recourse to a friend.

Let us not omit, when the opportunity occurs, to show that calm
scientific labors afford not only more durable emotions than those
derived from the frivolities of the world, but that they are often accom-
panied by the same vivacity.

There was in Gay-Lussac’s laboratory, by the side of furnaces, retorts,
and apparatus of every kind, a small white wooden table, on which our
friend recorded the results of his experiments as they progressed. It
was, if I may be allowed the comparison, the exact bulletin written
during battle. It was on this little table that were also traced the
articles concerning different points of doctrine or questions of priority.

It would be impossible, in relating the life of a man whose chief
works date back to the beginning of this century, the period of an entire
renovation in chemistry, that we should not have to mention discussions
of this kind. These scientific polemics took place especially between
Gay-Lussac, Dalton, Davy, Berzelius, &c. You see our friend dealt
with doughty antagonists, with adversaries worthy of him. In these
discussions our old friend marched straight forward, regardless of any
one, with the vigor, let us say more, with the dryness, of a mathematical
demonstration. Rarely do we find in them phrases like the balm applied
to freshly-made wounds. But how is it that no one has remarked that
Gay-Lussac treated himself with a want of ceremony quite equal to that
which he used toward others ?

The following lines are quoted literally from one cf his writings: ‘The
results that I have given,” said he, in the Memoirs of Arcueil, “of the dif-
ferent combinations of azote and oxygen are not exact.”

Should not he who criticises his own works so frankly be excusable
for being so exclusively preoccupied with the interests of truth in ex-
amining the works of others?

CHANGEABLE DEVOTION TO HIS FRIENDS—HIS NOMINATION TO THE

opinion after hearing this recital.
168 EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAGC.

There was, in Auxerre, at the beginning of our first revolution, a
musical artist who was attached to the four large societies and to the
college of that city. The suppression of these establishments, in 1791,

brought great pecuniary troubles upon this respectable family. The

artist did not, however, lose courage, and devoted the small fortune of
his wife to the education of his three daughters, whom he wished to fit
for the honorable ysosition of governess. But the eldest of these young
girls, Josephine, becoming aware of the narrowness of the means of ~
her parents, and of the sacrifices they would have to endure before
attaining their object, earnestly begged to be placed in a mercantile
establishment in Paris, to remain there until the ages of her sisters and
their education should enable them to realize the hopes entertained for
them by their parents.

It was at a linen-draper’s, the usual refuge of women of all conditions —
and ages, whose lives had been disturbed by revolutions, where —
Josephine had placed herself, that Gay-Lussac made her acquaintance.
He saw, with curiosity, a young girl of seventeen seated behind the
counter holding in her hand a small book which seemed to fix her
attention deeply. ‘‘ What are you reading, miss?” he said. ‘A work,
perhaps, beyond my comprehension; it interests me, however, much—a

treatise on chemistry.” This singularity excited the interest of our

young friend; from that moment the unusual necessity for linen ware
brought him constantly to the draper’s, where he entered repeatedly into
conversation with the young reader of the chemical treatise; he loved
her and was loved in return, and obtained from her a promise of mar-
riage. Our illustrious colleague, as a future marriage dower, placed
Josephine in a boarding-school to complete her education, and especially
to learn English and Italian. Some time after’ she became his wife. I
would not venture to advise this rash fashion of choosing a wife,
although our celebrated chemist perfectly succeeded in it.

Beautiful, sparkling with wit, brilliant,and admired in society, for
which nevertheless she cared but little, for the grace and distinction of
her manners, Madame Gay-Lussac constituted for more than forty years
the happiness of her husband.

From the beginning, they adopted the amicable custom, the conse-
quence of some slight mutual concession, of merging their thoughts,
desires, or sentiments into one thought, one desire, one sentiment com-
mon to both. This identification in everything was such that they ended
by so entirely having the same handwriting that an amateur of auto-
graphs might readily believe that a memoir copied by Madame Gay-
Lussae had been written by the celebrated academician.

Three days before his death, touched by the infinite solicitude lavished
upon him, Gay-Lussac said to his wife, ‘‘ We will love each other to the
last; the sincerity of attachments is the only happiness.” This tender,
affectionate language will not spoil the portrait I have desired to draw
of our colleague.

EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC. 169

Gay-Lussac’s demeanor was always very grave; he entered frankly
into the bursts of merriment that a well-chosen anecdote created in
societies where he was surrounded by his friends, but he never provoked
them himself.

Gay-Lussac carried his love for his native land so far as never to be
willing to be witness of a performance of “ Pourceaugnac,” brought out
_ by Moliére at Limoges; his joy, therefore, knew no bounds when there
appeared, under the name of “ Nouveau Pourceaugnac,” a vaudeville by
M. Scribe, in which the principal character, M. de Roufignac, also a
native of Limousin, instead of being mystified, renders all the other
actors the sport of his witty mystifications.

It is related that La Fontaine, at one time, accosted all his friends
_ with, “‘ Have you read Le Prophete Baruch?” So it was with Gay-Lus-
sac; he never failed, no matter how little the circumstances authorized
it, to ask with candor equal to that of the fabulist, “Do you know the
‘Nouveau Pourceaugnac?’ It isa charming piece; I advise you to go
to see it.” And I must say for him that, though so saving of his time,
he preached by example.
| A single fact will suffice to show that Gay-Lussac gave himself up

enthusiastically to the honest inspirations of his soul, when necessary,
even at his own risk and peril, to baffle an intrigue or defend a friend..
At the second restoration it had been decided in high places, it was
said, to remove a professor, whose liberal sentiments had rendered him
an object of suspicion, from the Polytechnic School. But how effect
this dismissal without exciting great opposition? The professor was
zealous, respected, and even, I must say, beloved by all his pupils. The
case was embarrassing, when it was discovered that this victim of pub:
lic animosity had during the hundred days signed the additional act.
The professor of literature (it was not, let it be well understood, M.
Andrieux, but his successor) undertook to make every use of this dis-
covery. Ina meeting of the corps of instruction he declared that, in
his opinion, those who gave their support to the usurper, that Corsican
ogre, whatever might be their motives, were not worthy to lecture
before the youth to whom the future of the country was to be confided;
they should themselves decline to officiate. The member of the corps
of professors against whom this attack was directed asked permission
to explain himself, when Gay-Lussac arose impetuously, interrupted
his friend, and announced in a sonorous voice that he also had signed
the additional act; that he would not hesitate in the future to sustain
the government, whatever it might be, even the government of Robes-
pierre, when the enemy threatened the frontiers; that, if the patriotic
sentiments which guided him were a subject of reprobation, he formally
demanded that the proposed reformation should begin in his person.

The professor of literature saw, therefore, that his proposition would
be followed by consequences which would far exceed the limit within
which he wished to confine it, and no more was said.
170 EULOGY ON GAY-LUSSAC.

Berthollet died in 1822; it was then known he had bequeathed his
sword, an integral part of his costume as peer of France, to Gay-Lussae ~

This bequest excited much surprise. But it will be found quite natural

if we follow out the chain of ideas which influenced the venerable

academician.

As the most illustrious of our chemists, Berthollet had been senator z
under the empire and peer of France during the restoration. ‘ Should a
we be surprised that he was persuaded that a science which was the 7
source of glory and wealth to our country, should not cease to be repre-
sented in the highest tribunals of thestate? When nearhisend, Berthollet —
examined, with the independence, tact, and judgment usually displayed

py the dying, to which of the living chemists this honor should revert;

his opinion was decidedly in favor of his friend and colleague Gay- —

Lussac; which he testified as fully as his habitual reserve allowed him,
by giving him a part of his future costume as peer. This was what this

gift signified, which it would be very difficult to understand without —

this explanation. Berthollet had often heard, while in Egypt, of the
symbolical language of flowers, frequently used by Mussulmans, and a
language which is the pride of many oriental poets. The circumstance
just related is but an extension of those poetical usages. The venerable
academician expressed, by the gift of an object so little in harmony

with the ordinary occupations of Gay-Lussac, the esteem he felt for our

friend and his inviolable attachment. This act of enlightened justice
however, was not realized as promptly as was hoped. ‘Why,’ said the

friends of Gay-Lussac to the dispensers of royal favors, ‘why make him

wait so long for a reward which he must receive sooner or later? Do —

you think him not sufficiently distinguished?” ‘ You wrong us,” they _
reply. ‘Have you any fault to find with his connections?” ‘Weare not 4

ignorant that they are all honorable and of gentle birth.” “Isit by any

accident a question of fortune?” ‘We know that Gay-Lussac enjoys an q
_ ample competence, the fruit of hisownlabor.” ‘What, then,is the obsta- _
le?” And then they acknowledged, softly, very gently, shrouding if
themselves in mystery, as if ashamed of such an avowal, that the great i

chemist worked every morning with his own hands at the assay-office,
which seemed incompatible with the dignity of a peer of France.

Such was the wretched motive which, for several years, interfered —

with the fulfillment of Berthollet’s ingenious horoscope. Indeed, it is

difficult to imagine that a man can degrade himself by working with _
his hands in attempting to prove the reality of his theoretical concep- —

tions.
To take an instance at random, and from foreign sources, do the dis-
coveries of Huygeus and Newton forfeit any of their importance and

brillianey because the first made spectacles and the second telescopes

with their own hands? Are the immortal views of Herschel on the
constitution of the heavens at all lessened for having been obtained by
instruments fashioned, by the illustrious observer himself ?

EULOGY ON. GAY-LUSSAC. 171

Has a single voice in the House of Lords, so proud of its ancient privi-
leges, been raised to claim that Lord Ross had recently degraded him-
self by becoming in turn founder, forger, and polisher of metal, when,
by this triple qualification, he has endowed the science of astronomy
with the colossal telescope, now one of the marvels of Ireland ?

Could there bea puerility more worthy of contempt than that of which
he would be guilty who could ask, at the time when Watt was trying,
by the most careful experiments, to give the steam-engine that perfec-
tion which makes it the glory of the inventor and the power of his
country, whether the hands of the illustrious mechanician were covered

with iron-rust or coal-dust? At all events, reason finally triumphed
over prejudice, and Gay-Lussac was admitted into the House of Peers.

DEATH OF GAY-LUSSAC—HIS LAST WORDS—HE CAUSES THE TREATISE
ENTITLED PHILOSOPHIE CHIMIQUE TO BE BURNED.

Gay-Lussac saw his end approach with the resignation which a pure
conscience must inspire. He not only faced death with calmness, but
even the act of dying, as Montaigne might have said.

When the sad news fell like a thunderbolt upon Paris that the health
of our colleague was a cause of great solicitude, one of his friends imme-
diately wrote to the afflicted family who surrounded him to learn the
truth. Gay-Lussac desired to reply himself. The following were the
words of the dying man:

“ My DEAR ARAGO: My son has just told me of your letter to him.
It is but too true; I have one foot in the grave, which must very soon

close over me; but I gather all my strength to thank you for the interest

you take in me, and to tell you that the mutual affection of our two
families has been a source of great happiness to me all my life.

“Adieu, my dear Arago.”

Do not imagine, gentlemen, for a moment, that I could, on this solemn
occasion, wish to make a parade of sentiments so unaffected, to sponta-
neous, and so free from that straining after effect which formerly led
Madame de Sévigné to describe the friendships of the dying hour. A
self-deception emanating at all events from the heart would be forgiven.

The forebodings of Gay-Lussac, his family, and the public yielded every
moment to more encouraging anticipations. Our colleague Magendie,
who had hastened to his old friend with his scientific skill, was, for a
short time, himself deluded by this general hope.

Gay-Lussac was removed to Paris, where his condition for some days
seemed to improve. He spoke to us then of his future work, and of
the regret he felt, at a time when there seemed no possibility of pro-
longing his life, at having given an order to his son to burn his treatise,
Philosophie Chimique, the first chapters of which were nearly finished.
But he was soon forced to abandon all hope.

The dropsy, with which he had: been suddenly attacked, made rapid

progress, and our friend expired quietly and bravely on the 9th of May,
1850, at the age of seventy, and he might have said with one of ancient.
times, “If it were given me to live my life over again, I would on all
ocasions do as I have done.”

The obsequies of the learned academician were solemnized May 11,
in the midst of a large concourse, including nearly the entire body of his
early associates of the Academy of Sciences, and some of the most dis-
tinguished members of other acadamies; the entire institute testified in
this manner that it could not at that time have suffered a greater loss.
The early pupils of the Polytechnic School, the entire body of the two.
present classes of the school, the friends of science, and many grateful
auditors of the two excellent courses of the Sorbonne and the Jardin des.
Plantés, also joined in the funeral procession.

The various political opinions which unhappily divided our country
were blended together in this mournful train, and who could, indeed,
say to which of these parties Gay-Lussac belonged? What party could
flatter itself to have numbered the illustrious scientist in its ranks ?
The compatriots of our colleague once intrusted him with the honor
of representing them in the Chamber of Deputies. Later, as we have
seen, Louis Philippe made him peer of France; but he approached the
tribunes of these two assemblies very rarely, and only to discuss
special questions relating to his favorite studies. Should this reserve
be attributed to timidity, or can it be simply explained by Gay-Lus-
sac’s desire not to introduce any disturbing elements into the even cur-
rent of his life? If this last supposition be correct, he was perfectly
successful. Never did the foulest of all calumnies, political calumny,
attack the scientific career of our associate. His works have escaped

the daily criticisms of those hireling writers who, before taking up the —

pen, ask themselves, not what are the real merits of the memoirs whose-
analysis they are about to publish, but what are the supposed opinions
of their authors upon the exciting and yet perplexing questions of social
organization. The discoveries of our colleague have always been ap-
preciated in France at their just value. We can, therefore, say of him,.
in the words of Voltaire, written under a portrait of Leibnitz, ‘‘ Even.
in his own country he lived respected.”

The recollections of the profound friendship which bound me to Gay-
Lussac for more than forty years have perhaps tempted me into too
minute details in writing his biography. However that may be,
I will sum up the history of this beautiful life in these few words:
Gay-Lussac was a good father, an excellent citizen, an honest man in
every event of his life, an ingenious physicist, and a peerless chemist..
He honored France by his moral qualities, and the academy by his-
discoveries.’ His name will be uttered with admiration and respect in
every land where science is cultivated. Finally, the illustrious acade-
mician will live forever in the hearts and memories of all who had the
happiness to rejoice in his friendship. —

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO [1, EMPEROR OF BRAZIL.

BY ANPRISO FIALHO,

Doctor of Political and Administrative Science, of Brussels.

[Translated for the Smithsonian Institution by M. A. Henry. ]

PREFACE.

About a year ago the telegraph announced the intention of the
Emperor of Brazil to visit the United States, and the countries of the
- north of Europe he had omitted in his first tour in 1871. Remembering
the favorable manner in which the journals had at that time spoken
of the distinguished traveler and of his reign, which has lasted now
for forty-five years, I determined to prepare an account of both for the
public, although under a very abridged form.

We offer then to the reader only a biographical sketch, for we have
no intention of encroaching upon the domain of future historians, par-
ticularly as the reign of Dom Pedro II has not yet terminated, but we
are happy to be able to furnish some well established facts, which may
serve as a foundation for a more extended work, superior to ours in
style and form, although not in truthfulness of statement.

Before touching upon the place in Brazilian history occupied by the
reign of Dom Pedro II, let us glance rapidly over the history of Brazil,
from its discovery to the ascension to the throne by its present Emperor.

INTRODUCTION.

HISTORY OF BRAZIL FROM ITS DISCOVERY UNTIL THE ASCENSION TO
THE THRONE BY DOM PEDRO II.

About the end of the year 1499 and the commencement of 1500,
three Spanish navigators, Alonzo de Hojeda, Vicente Yanes de Pingon,
Diogo de Lepe, and the Portuguese admiral, Pedro Alvares Cabral,
landed successively at different points of the coast of Brazil, whose ex-
istence at that time was entirely unknown. Although Cabral had been
_preceded by the three Spanish navigators, and owed his discovery
only to the circumstance of having involuntarily wandered from the

173
174 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO IIL.

route he should have followed for the Indies, the king of Portugal, _
Dom Manoel was the first to announce to Europe this important dis- |
covery, and to take possession of the new country, to which the Portu- —
guese gave the name of Brazil, on account of the well known wood of —
that name which abounds there. Brazil thus became a colony of Portu-
gal.

By nature rich beyond expression, and seeming only to await the — |
hand of civilized man to yield every possible profit, Brazil was for
Portugal an inexhaustible mine of wealth, with this important advan-
tage, that its great distance from all European nations shielded it from _
invasion. ’

The importance of the possession of Brazil was especially felt by
the royal house of Portugal, when Napoleon threatened to seize their
country and join it to Spain, (treaty of Fontainebleau in 1807.) This
circumstance determined the prince regent, Dom Juan, to intrust the
defense of the kingdom to England, and to embark himself for Brazil
with all his family, and a numerous court. Brazil thus became the seat
of the Portuguese royalty, and was afterwards raised to the dignity of a ©
kingdom. Ky

The residence of the royal family in the country was prolonged to
1821, that is to say, until a large party in Portugal, discontented with
what appeared to be a desertion of their country by their sovereign,
and also on account of the commercial relations Brazil entertained with the
rest of the world, contrary to the ancient monopoly accorded to Portu- —
gal, excited a revolution which soon extended over the entire country, —
and at last obliged the king to return to Portugal. On leaving for
Europe, Dom Juan placed at the head of the government of Brazil his. —
son Pedro, heir presumptive to the throne.

It was not without grave apprehensions that the king quitted Brazil,
for there had been several attempts to attain the independence of the
country, and the most enlightened of its patriots still entertained hopes. _
of eventually securing its freedom. Foreseeing the impossibility of |
subduing these revolutionary efforts sufficiently to prevent a recurrence
of them, and at the same time knowing the monarchical tendencies of
the majority of the Brazilian people, he on his departure very wisely
counseled his son to place himself upon the throne in case a separation
of Brazil from the mother country appeared inevitable.

After the return of the royal family to Portugal, the Cortés resolved —
to reduce Brazil to its former state of a colony, and compelled the king
to adopt certain reactionary measures which outraged the dignity and
aroused the patriotism of the Brazilians. The Cortés in fact forgot that
in the moral as well as the physical world it is not possible to attempt
to repress what is irrepressible without danger of explosion or rupture.

The prince regent of Brazil, Dom Pedro, hardly twenty-three years of
age, Saw these indications of discontent with uneasiness. His situation
became more and more embarrassing. It was difficult for him to decide

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO II. 175

what, under the circumstances, was his duty: for if, on the one hand, he:
desired to enforce obedience to the sovereign authority of Portugal, on
the other, he found the nation quite ready to proclaim him as king, but
also determined not to hesitate even in the use of force, if necessary to
secure independence. There was in his mind a terrible conflict between
the apparent duty—which he had not the strength to discharge—and
the noble ambition of preventing the return of a people who had tasted
of the sweet cup of liberty to a colonial condition. Added to the latter
consideration was the fact that his father and sovereign had in advance
released him from the loyal adherence which was his due, and had him-
self suggested the solution of the question of Brazilian independence,
if it were irresistibly presented.

. Under these circumstances, the Portuguese Cortés themselves relieved
Dom Pedro of his embarrassment; first by the issue of orders tending to
deprive him of all administrative authority over the Brazilian provinces,.
and finally by his recall to Europe. The departure of the prince would
have compelled the Brazilians to assert their rights by the demand for
another occupant for their throne. The moment was decisive, and the
Brazilians understood this so well that they entreated Dom Pedro to
remain in the country, in order that the contest might be avoided which
must inevitably ensue, and also that he might assist them in securing
finally their independence. Dom Pedro yielded to the desire of the
nation, expressed to him through its legitimate representatives, in
words which have become celebrated in the history of Brazil: ‘ Since
it is for the good of the country, I remain.” Brazilian independence,
under the form of a monarchy, was decided from that moment. Whether
Dom Pedro was actuated entirely by ambition, or solely by the desire
to found a free state—which is much more in accordance with his chiv-
alrous disposition—there was now for him no honorable retreat. Like
Cesar, after passing the Rubicon, contrary to the orders of the Roman
senate, he could say, ‘‘Alea jacta est !”

Events followed in rapid suecession. The resolution to remain in
Brazil contrary to the expressed orders of the mother country was taken
on the 9th of January, 1822. Only four months after, the young prince
accepted the title of Perpetual Protector of Brazil, offered to him by the
municipality of Rio de Janeiro in the name of the nation, and on the
12th of October of the same year he was proclaimed Emperor, under
the name of Dom Pedro I. The independence of Brazil was thus
peaceably obtained, for the Portuguese garrisons in the country made
but slight resistance and were soon overcome.*

The empire established, it was necessary to give it a constitution, but
the discussion of this important document led to very serious disagree-
ments between the members of the chamber of deputies and the sover-

ef August, which imposed upon the country the payment of two millions of pounds

eign, who at last summarily dissolved the legislative body. We can

easily understand the irritation this act produced in the nation. The
Emperor, in order to calm the disturbance and restore public confidence,
prepared, in 1825, a most liberal constitution. But unbiased judgment
was no longer possible; misunderstandings again occurred in regard to
the execution of this fundamental code; for, on the one hand, the
Emperor, who had been reared in absolutism, had a natural tendency in
that direction in spite of himself, and, on the other hand, the liberals
wished to efface this element completely from the government in order
that they might rule. Fault existed on both sides. The fact was, the
political parties, as well as the sovereign, were novices in parliamentary
government. A curious incident shows the state of public feeling at
this time. On the 25th of March, 1831, anniversary day of the adoption
of the constitution, the Emperor went, according to custom, to church
to assist in the Ze Dewm announced for the occasion. On his entrance
there was a ery of ‘ Long life to the Emperor!” followed by “As long as

he is constitutional!” The Emperor turned toward the portion of the —

audience from which the latter came, and said in a firm, clear voice,
‘Tam and have always been a constitutional sovereign!” This, how-
ever, did not prevent discontent from increasing every day.

On the 6th of April the Emperor, considering his ministers inefficient,
dismissed them and appointed others. The malcontents seized upon
this occasion to promote a revolt, in which the garrison of the capital
participated. The insurgents sent messengers to the sovereign to de-
mand the restoration of the dismissed ministers, under the pretext that
the new officers had not inspired the people with sufficient confidence.
The Emperor replied, ‘‘Z will do everything for the sake of the people, but noth-
ing by force of the people ;” and, although he could count upon the support
of the Portuguese part of the community, and of the troops of that nation-
ality, in the maintenance of his authority, he preferred to abdicate in
favor of his son rather than shed the blood of hiscountrymen. Hesigned
the act of abdication the next day, the 7th of April, and set sail a few
hours afterward for Portugal, where he re-established his daughter,
Maria da Gloria, upon the throne which her uncle and husband Don
Miguel had usurped. His son, in whose favor he abdicated the throne
of Brazil, is the present Emperor Dom Pedro II.

the 2d of December, 1825; and had hardly completed his fifteenth year:
when his august father abdicated in his favor, in accordance with the
constitution, which prescribed that with- the same degree of relation-
ship, preference should be given to the masculine sex.* His name is
Pedro @’Alcantara Joao Carlos Leopoldo Leocadeo Miguel Gabriel
Raphael Gonzaga; his title, Constitutional Emperor and Perpetual Pro-
tector of Brazil.

The childhood of this prince was far from happy, for his mother died
the year following his birth, and his father was engaged in the harass-
ing and almost daily political struggle which terminated with his abdi-
cation. It is doubtful whether, under the circumstances, Dom Pedro [
had the time to attend, as he would have desired, to the education of
his children. They did not even witness his departure, the Emperor
having determined suddenly in the night to abdicate and leave the
country. He did not wish to disturb the peaceful slumber of his chil-
dren, and contented himself with embracing them several times very
tenderly and with tears. It was a sad spectacle, this valiant soldier,
who had many times braved the danger of revolutionary crises, weep-
ing in the presence of his court, his ministers, the embassadors of France
and England, his friends, and his faithful generals.

Imagine the sorrow of his children the next morning when they
received, instead of the paternal kiss, the sad news of the departure of

the father they would perhaps never see again. Although Dom Pedro,

on account of his extreme youth, could not feel all the importance of
such an event, his tears, and the manner in which he pressed in his
arms his young sisters, testified to the extent of his grief. How many
children of the people were at that moment happier in their cottages

than he in a palace, notwithstanding he had just come into the posses-

sion of an immense empire.

According to the Brazilian constitution the Emperor is a minor until
the age of eighteen years, and during his minority the empire must be
governed by a regent, the member of the imperial family the most
nearly related to the Emperor, provided always such relative is more
than twenty-five years of age. In case there should be no relative ful-
filling this condition, it is the duty of the chamber of deputies and the

senate to nominate a permanent regency composed of three members,

the oldest of which is the president. This was done, and the regency,
consisting at first of the required number of persons, was, a few years
later, after the reform of the constitution, reduced to one, elected by the
nation for a term of four years. ‘

The men who were successively called to the noble task of preparing

Dom Pedro to govern his empire, acquitted themselves in a manner
worthy the honor and gratitude of their countrymen. While endeavor- 7
ing to establish the empire of law in this nation distracted by anarchy, —
the regents never for a moment forgot the physical and intellectual ;
education of the young monarch. The principal direction was intrusted
to the bishop of Chrysopolis, to the great satisfaction of all acquainted —
with this venerable gentleman, eminent not only for his virtues, but —
also for his great attainments.

Under this wise and paternal instruction, Dom Pedro, with his two
young sisters for companions, passed his days in the midst of books and
toys, with all a child’s unconscious freedom from care, when he received ~
the terrible news of the death of his illustrious father (1834). He had
not then completed his tenth year. The intelligence, which was as un-
expected as sad, produced in his youthful mind, after an interval of the .
most violent arioh a complete change; he pace grave almost to sad-
ness, while all his actions and words seemed to be carefully considered.
This transformation can be very naturally explained. The young prince,
deprived of his mother, had settled all his filial affection and hopes upon
his father. His confidence in the power of the parent, who had be-
queathed to him his rights as a monarch, to draw the sword if necessary.
to maintain them intact,as he had done for his daughter in Portugal, was
in accordance with the ideas of his age. This prop suddenly withdrawn,
this powerful moral support lost to him, he felt the necessity of self-
reliance and of preparation for the gulf which might any moment open
under his feet in a country where the ambition and the vanity of the

political men were unbounded, while moral as well as material law were —

absolutely wanting. He then very naturally determined to make a man ~
of himself, to seriously prepare not only to guard against danger, but
also to meet it if necessary. A happy inspiration taught him that the

surest way to this end was the acquirement of superior knowledge, of —}

science in all its branches. The most learned professors, national and
foreign, to be found in the country or that could be obtained from abroad
had heen provided for his classical studies, and later, others were in-
trusted with his instruction in philosophy and mathematics as well as —
the natural, moral, and political sciences. Although pursuing all these —
branches with equal facility and like ardor, he had for the natural sci-

ences a marked preference amounting to enthusiasm. His application —

to study soon produced results which excited the admiration of those
who surrounded him, but also caused uneasiness to the bishop of Chrys- |
opolis and the regent in the fear that he might injure his health by too |
great application. It is related that one evening the venerable instructor 4
was obliged to remonstrate seriously with his young pupil because the |

latter had fallen into the habit of relighting his lamp for study after it |

had been extinguished by the bishop for the night. |
The fruits of his industry soon became evident in his conversation, —
which was remarkably intelligent for one of his age, nor was it without |}

_ « certain satisfaction that he exhibited his attainments, unusually varied
and solid for a youth of fourteen. We shall see later how this love of
study was turned to the great advantage of his country.

fiat

In 1840 Dom Pedro was in his fifteenth year. Civil war had for five
years desolated the province of the Southern Rio Grande, the most im-
portant and the strongest portion of the empire, as far as regarded means
of defense from the neighboring countries of the Plata. This condition
of political disturbance in one portion of the empire, with the ebullition of
- a rebellious spirit under forms more or less violent in various parts of

the country, ended by producing a general feeling of discontent, which’

in the capital assumed more and more of a threatening character.
This state of things exactly suited idle mischief-makers and ambitious,
unscrupulous politicians. The public good, the welfare of the country,
state reasons, and other high-sounding phrases of the same character,
not without their effect when skillfully used, especially in a country
whose organization is still imperfect, were the order of the day both
¥ with the press and in places of public business. At this period two
political parties appeared to predominate over the various factions which
divided the country. Their tendencies were in general the same as the
two opposing parties in a constitutional government—the liberal and
the conservative. The former, which was in the minority in the cham-
| _ bers, whether eager to obtain power, or wishing to recommend itself to
' the supreme head of the nation, perhaps because really convinced that
the good of the country required a radical change in the personnel of
_ the administration, proposed, through its representatives in the session
_ of parliament, that the young prince should be declared of age. This
project was lost in the senate, and when presented a month later to the
house of deputies, excited the most stormy discussions ever known in
Brazil. Finally, the regent (Senator Pedro de Aranjo Lima, after-
ward Marquis of Olinda) determined to order an adjournment of the
chambers. In the state of publie feeling this act was certainly im-
politic; and the communication of the decree to the chamber of depu-
ties (July 22, 1840) was like setting fire to a powder-mine ready for an
_ explosion. It produced immediately violent excitement. The authors
of the project for declaring the Emperor of age and its principal sup-
porters quitted the hall immediately, and collecting adherents in the |

_ streets proceeded to the senate, where they joined the few members of

that body in favor of the proposition. They then sent to Dom Pedro a

deputation, with a communication. signed by five senators and three
members of the house of deputies, in which it was declared that ‘“ the
adjournment of the legislative chambers at the moment when the ma-
jority of the Emperor was proposed was an insult to his august person,
as well as treason to the nation; and in view of the great evils which
must accrue to the tranquillity of the capital from such an adjournment,

180 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO II.

since the enemies of public peace would take advantage of this event
to disturb society to its foundation, the Emperor was entreated to save
the country and the throne by taking into his own hands, from that
moment, the exercise of the high attributes the constitution conferred —
upon him. Instead of resisting with firmness this demand, the regent —
left Dom Pedro to his own unadvised inspirations, and demanded of lim, ~
in the presence of the delegates, whether he would accede to their desires. —
The young prince, much agitated, answered, “Yes.” What other re-
sponse could he make, face to face with anarchy and threatened revolu-
tion, especially after the weakness manifested by the government.

This was on Wednesday. The regent immediately announced his in-—
tention to convoke parliament for the following Sunday, in order that
the majority of the Emperor might be publicly declared according to
the constitution. A member of the deputation objected to any delay, —
and proposed that this convocation should take place the next day. —
On the following day, therefore, the 23d of July, Dom Pedro II was.
declared of age by the president of the general assembly of the repre-
sentatives of the nation, and on the same day took the oath imposed by
the fundamental law of the empire. This political event excited great.
enthusiasm throughout the entire nation; weary of the often bloody
struggles of the factions, there seemed hopes of a better future in the —
political emancipation of the prince. In consequence of this emancipa-
tion the liberal party were brought into power. The minister pro-
nounced the chamber of deputies dissolved, and decided that the Em- —
peror should be crowned the following year.

Vi.

Behold Dom Pedro then governing by himself his vast empire. The —
burden he had assumed, or rather which had been placed upon his
shoulders, afforded grounds for reflection for more than one sincere
friend of the monarchical form of government and of the reigning dy-
nasty; for from 1831, the period of the abdication of the first Emperor,
to 1840, the majority of his son and successor, none of the statesmen
who had held the reins of government had been able entirely to con-
trol anarchy and the ambitious spirits who aspired either to the central
government or to that of the provinces, which they saw in their auda-
cious dreams converted into independent republics. In fact the first.
years of the government of Dom Pedro did not pass without danger to —
the monarchy. First, the serious revolution of the province of the Rio |
Grande had not been entirely quelled, and there seemed no near pros- |
pect of its termination ; then the struggle between the liberal and the
conservative party, both through the press and in the tribune, assumed
a more and more violent character and ended by an actual contest at
arms.

The conservative party, in return for the prompt action by which the |
liberal minority had obtained the power and forced consent to the major- _

wih

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO II. 181

ity of the Emperor, induced the young and inexperienced monarch
- to dissolve the new liberal chamber even before it had assembled, on

account of alleged violence and fraud committed during the election,
and placed itself at the head of the administration of the government of
the country. The liberals followed this defection by the revolution of
1842, in two of the largest provinces of the empire—Minas-Geraes and
S. Paulo—but were soon subdued. However, their exclusion from the
government was not of long continuance, for two years afterwards we
see them again in power, to be reversed anew in 1848. Again they took
up arms, this time at Pernambuco. The contest was bloody, but hap-
pily did not last long, and the rebels were conquered as before. If the
young Emperor had not at this time sufficient experience in the govern-
ment of men to avoid these fratricidal struggles, he had an opportunity
of manifesting his conciliatory disposition by using one of the most
beautiful prerogatives granted him by the constitution—that of remis-
sion of punishment, and pardon of the guilty.

The conservative party, in 1845, brought to an end the important
revolution of the Rio Grande, and gained by this new success a prestige
and reputation for order which maintained it in power until 1863.

The Emperor was married, by power of attorney, in 1843, to the daugh-
ter of Francis I, King of the Two Sicilies, the Princess Thérése Christine
de Bourbon;* and in 1845 he made with her a journey through the
southern provinces of the Rio Grande and S. Paulo, to study for him-
Self the means of avoiding the return of discontent.

Vv.

Order was hardly restored (after the revolution of 1848) when the

attention of the government was called to the neighboring countries of

La Plata, under the despotic rule of General Rosas, President of the

_ Argentine Confederation.

This audacious gaizcho had conceived the project of re-establishing for
his own benefit the ancient Spanish vice-royalty of La Plata, which in-
cluded the territories known to-day under the names of the Argentine
Confederation and the republics of Paraguay and Uruguay.

Foreseeing the danger that must necessarily arise from an increase .
of the power of Rosas to Brazilian commerce, a part of which was car-
ried on by river communication with the Brazilian province of Matto-
Grosso, ‘he imperial government was making preparations to oppose this
measure, when Rosas, by his hostile attitude toward Brazil, which he

presumptive to the crown, is called Isabel. She is married to Prince Louis-Philippe-

accused of taking part with his enemies, himself furnished a pretext for
declaring war.

Brazil then formed an alliance with General Urquiza, governor of a”
province of the Argentine Confederation in revolt against Rosas. Their
united forces marched against the despot and vanquished him on the
2d of February, 1852, at Monte-Casero, not far from Buenos Ayres.
Rosas embarked the same day for England.

VI.

From this period really began that progress which excites the admi-
ration of all who compare the Brazil of the present with the Brazil of —
twenty-five years ago. This beautiful era in the history of the vast em- —
pire commenced with the abolition of the slave trade an immense
step toward civilization, followed by a veritable enthusiasm for commer-
cial and industrial enterprises; then were laid the first railroads, the
especial lines of which, such as those of state, received the guarantee of
an interest of 7 per cent.; the companies for river and maritime navi-
gations were largely increased; Europe was brought into communica-
tion with Brazil by means of steam; gas was introduced into all the
great cities, and good roads were opened. Most of these enterprises
gave to agricultural industry, especially to the culture of coffee, sugar,
tobacco, and cotton, a marked impulse, and were thus of material bene-
fit to all classes of society.

The satisfactory condition of the country allowed Dom Pedro to make
an excursion of several months to the northern part of Brazil, (1859.)
He visited in succession the provinces of Bahia, Pernambuco, d’ Alagoas,
and Parahyba. He was everywhere welcomed with great enthusiasm,
and received such warm ovations that it may be said his journey was
one continued féte, by which the people endeavored to express their love
and gratitude for the great benefit they had received through his wise
government. This visitation of the empire was of the greatest utility
in a particular as well as general point of view. For everywhere the
Emperor endeavored to learn for himself the degree of intellectual and
material development of the provinces, what was needed to secure their
progress, and especially the manner in which the governors adminis-
tered their office.

On his return to the capital he took the necessary measures, in con-
formity with the information he had obtained, for the benefit of the
provinces he had visited.

VEL.

This peaceful prosperity, which lasted ten years, was suddenly dis-
turbed by a double incident known under the name of the Lnglish Con-
Jlict, and worthy of notice because evincing the energy of Dom Pedro,

when called to maintain the dignity of the nation of which he is the :|

head, and also the ardent patriotism of the Brazilian people.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO II 183

' Towards the end of 1862, some officers of the English navy had, in
the garb of peasants, deserted from a military post in the vicinity of
Rio; they were seized in a brawl by the civil authorities and impris-
oned until they could be identified, which was done the next day.. The
English government claimed satisfaction fur their detention, but the
Brazilian government, believing no satisfaction was necessary, submitted
to the decision of Leopold J, King of Belgium, the question whether the
English navy had cause for offense. The Belgian monarch replied in
the negative. But, before this decision was received, the minister from
England at Rio, (Mr. Christie,) either because he was angry with the’
Brazilian government for refusing the satisfaction demanded, or fore-
seeing the sentence of the king of Belgium, and not wishing to remain
under the unfavorable impression of a condemnation he had himself
provoked, demanded and obtained authority from England to require of
the Brazilian government an immediate settlement of a claim which had
been under consideration for two years, and which necessitated the ~
payment of a sum of money (6,000 pounds sterling) as indemnity for
the losses resulting from the shipwreck of a small English vessel upon
the coast of Brazil. This was the second incident. The imperial govern-
ment refused to comply with the demand before the claim had been

fully discussed. The English minister then ordered the commander

of the English squadron stationed in the Brazilian waters to exercise
the act of reprisal until the sum named was paid. As soon as this order
was known the entire populace of the capital arose in indignation, and
a large body, carrying the national colors, proceeded to the palace of S.
Christovam,* the ordinary residence of the Emperor, and encountering
the sovereign on the way, conducted him in triumph to his city palace,
where the monarch had already called a council of the ministers. It
was on this occasion Dom Pedro uttered these memorable words, which
secured to him forever the love of the Brazilian people: “‘Z desire above

all to show that in the presence of danger I am the equal of every other
Brazilian citizen.”

Although the ministers shared the indignation of the sovereign and
the people at this uncalled-for violence on the part of a foreign power,
still, as responsible for any measures taken, it was necessary to reflect
caretully before acting. The opinion was earnestly maintained that force
should be met with ee, but by the minority. After along deliberation,
it was concluded that a contest upon the sea, although offering some ad-
vantages in the commencement, would at last become too unequal to
be continued with any chance of final success; it was therefore decided
that the government should agree to pay the required sum, but directly
_ to the English Government, provided the latter persisted in the demand
made by its representative at Rio. The English Government insisted,
and the sum was paid, but under protest. :
_ The Emperor, considering the conduct of the English government as

un act of mere caprice, withdrew his representative at London; which —
determined the recall of Mr. Christie. Diplomatic relations were not 4
restored between Brazil and Englaid until three years later, and then
through the intervention of the King of Portugal.

It is a common saying ‘that evil always has its good side.” The conflict
with England was not without advantage to Brazil, in that it manifested
the weakness of the country as compared with the great maritime pow-
ers, and showed the Brazilians that they should not confine their atten-
tion exclusively to interior prosperity, but should also acquire the means
of responding suitably to any exterior insult.

A number of respectable citizens then conceived the happy idea of.
raising a permanent national subscription for the purchase of modern
cannon and iron-clad vessels. This was met with enthusiasm by the
nation; donations were received from all sides; the Emperor subscribed
the fifth part of his civil list; the empress and the princess followed his
example, the public functionaries and the officers of the army gave 5
per cent. of their salaries; the rich land-holders promised large amounts ;
the poor also, to the extent of their ability, manifested their patriotism,
The subscription amounted in a few months only, to a sum of several
millions. Large orders were then sent to Europe for all kinds of war-
engines, while the armories of the country worked with an activity be-
fore unknown. The Emperor himself manifested indefatigable energy;
he visited every day arsenals, workshops, dock-yards, fortresses, war-
vessels, military schools, and everywhere exhibited knowledge which
astonished even specialists. All these efforts were crowned with Dril-
liant success, as we shall see. But first we would mention that about
the middle of 1863 the conservative party was obliged to give way be-
fore the liberal party, which came into power by the elections following
the dissolution of the Chamber of Deputies, in which the conservative
majority had become doubtful.

Vink

In April, 1863, occurred in the republic of Uruguay, adjoining Brazil,
a revolution, at the head of which was General Flores. The govern-
ment of Uruguay could not subdue the insurgents for want of men and
money, and had, like its predecessors, recourse to violent incursions
upon the property of the Brazilians living on the frontiers of the re-
public, taking from them especially their herds of sheep and cattle.
Under these circumstances many subjects of the empire were maltreated
and even forced to enroll under the flag of the republic.

The government of the Emperor remonstrated with the government
of Uruguay, but the President of the republic, (Aguirre,) while feigning
a desire to do justice to the complaints of the empire, for which he held
his subaltern agents responsible, in reality endeavored to support the
republic of Paraguay.

This republic was at that time governed by Lopez II, who was a re-

“

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO II. 185

publican only in name. He was, in fact, the most immoral, the most
tyrannical ruler in all America. He was, besides, very ambitious of
military glory, and as soon as he became President (in appearance by
election of the self-called National Congress, but in reality by heritage
and his own will,as the only generalof the republic) he imagined he could
perform in La Plata the role which Napoleon III had for some time taken
in Europe, viz, the maintenance of European equilibrium. For this end
he made of the nation a regular military depot, and only waited for an
opportunity to send forth his troops. He had, besides, accumulated an
immense quantity of material for war, so that he was quite prepared
not only to enter into a military contest, but to maintain it for a long
time.

The hostile attitude of Brazil toward Uruguay furnished the Presi-
dent of Paraguay with the pretext he desired to forward his pretensions.
After demanding, for the sake of form, of the representative of Brazil
at Assumption (the capital) information in regard to the views of the
imperial government, he sent to the latter, in the month of September,
1864, a declaration that he would not consent to the occupation by
Brazilian troops, neither permanently nor temporarily, of any part
whatever of the territory of Uruguay. :

The imperial government made a mistake in taking no notice of this
declaration of the despot ; and, not receiving the satisfaction demanded
of the government of Uruguay, invaded the territory of that republic.
The Brazilian troops and those of General Flores, who held the open
country, naturally united against the common enemy, and obtained

_ their first victory in the taking by assault of the city of Paysandee.

This alliance, made upon the field of battle, having been ratified by the
imperial government, the united forces marched together upon the cap-
ital of the enemy,(Montevideo,) and obliged it to capitulate on the 20th
of February, 1865:

The news of the invasion of Uruguay provoked on the part of Lopez
an open act of hostility against Brazil. A steamer was expected belong-
ing toa Brazilian company, and which did service between Rio Janeiro
and the Brazilian province of Matto-Grosso, passing by the capital of
Paraguay. When the boat arrived at Assumption—it was the Marquez
de Olinda—it was seized by order of Lopez and most of the passengers
made prisoners, among others a colonel who was on his way to take
charge of the government of the province of Matto-Grosso, (November,
1864.)

This act excited great indignation in the empire, and an outery from
all parts of the country for punishment of the tyrant. The feeling was
so general, that at the end of several weeks the number of the volunteers
who responded to an appeal made by the Emperor to their patriotism
was wore than sufficient, and the government was obliged to decline

‘further offers of service. Lopez then took possession of the province of
Matto-Grosso. He was obliged to pass through the territory of the Ar-
186 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO II.

gentine Republic in order to invade a second Brazilian province, Rio —
Grand de Sud, and, not having obtained permission, did: so by force, —

commencing hostilities by the surprise and seizure of two ships of war.
Thus a triple alliance was formed against Lopez, consisting of Brazil
and the two republics, Argentine and Uruguayan. General Mitré,
President of the Argentine Republic, was made chief in command of
the aliied armies.*

Although the tyrant had to struggle against all Wige powers, the war
lasted five years, and was the most sanguinary that had ever been known
in South America. In the first place, Lopez possessed, as we have said,
formidable resources in the materials for wart he had collected. Then
Paraguay, the principal theatre of operations, was admirably protected
by numerous lagunes, water-courses, forests, and mountain-chains, while
to these natural barriers were added extensive military constructions.

Brazil, which was the soul of the alliance, and which alone possessed
a squadron, blockaded Paraguay from the commencement of the year
1865, while the allied armies assembled upon the territory of the Ar-
gentine Republic, in order to pass over the 200 leagues which separated
them from the enemy’s country.

In the month of June, 1865, the Brazilian squadron destroyed, in the
naval contest of Riachuelo, the squadron of Paraguay, consisting of
eight war-steamers, protected by floating batteries of earth.t Three
months later the Paraguayan commander of a column of 10,000 men
(the same which had invaded the province of the Rio Grande) capitu-
lated in the city of Uruguayana, in the presence of the Emperor, who
had undertaken in person to drive the enemy from this part of the em-
pire.

In April, 1866, the allies passed the Parana, the frontier of the enemy.
Several battles, among which should be mentioned that of the 24th of |
May at Tuyuty, (about 70,000 men were present,) distinguished the
first period of the campaign in the enemy’s country. The assault under-
taken on the 23d of September, from the direction of Curupaity, against
the terrible Humayta, (fhe Sebastopol of America, constructed upon a
very sharp elbow of the river Paraguay,) failed completely, with great
loss to the allied forces. The latter then undertook a siege of the fort-
ress, which lasted two years.

The fall of Humayta (August, 1868) was secured only when the iron-

* The Brazilian army was commanded by General Osorio, and that of Uruguay by
the President, General Flores.

+ He commenced with an army of 80,000 men, in all respects perfectly equipped, and
well distributed over the entire region of the war.

¢ The battle took place upon the waters of the Parana, near the mouth of the small
river Riachuelo; hence the name of the contest. The Brazilian squadron was also
composed of eight war-steamers of wood, the iron-clad vessels being still-in course of
construction. The victory was for a long time undecided, and there were several very

exciting occurrences, among others the capture and recapture of a Brazilian sloop, the
Parnahyba.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO II. 187

clad squadron of Brazil forced the passage of the river defended by this
fortress; a passage which, in the beginning of the war, had been consid-
ered impracticable on account of the formidable batteries, the torpedoes,
the chains, and the vessels sunken in the stream, all of which formed a
powerful system of defense. The remains of the garrison of Humayta,
(4,000 men,) in accordance with the orders of Lopez, refused to surren-

der, and fought ten days without intermission in the almost-island

opposite the fortress, where they had taken refuge after being compelled
to evacuate. This valiant and obedient garrison, deaf to the most hon-
orable proposals of the allied commanders, ended by falling from ex-
haustion. Never was there a more bloody contest.

This obstacle surmounted, the Marquis of Caxias, placed at the head
of the Brazilian troops after the reverse of Curupaity, and commander
at this time of the allied forces, with the Brazilian squadron, also under
his orders, proceeded toward the capital of the enemy, which could,
however, be reached only by passing through the main body of the
army of the tyrant, which had protected the city with new and impor-
tant lines of defense. These had all been erected since the bloody battles
of Itororo and of.Avahy, (on the 8th and 11th of December, 1868,) and
the assaults upon the camp of Lopez, at Lomas Valentinas, (on the
21st and 25th of December,) in which the Brazilian army alone lost
a third of its most effective men. After repeated victories the allied
armies made their triumphal entrance into the capital, (on the Ist of
January, 1869,) which had been abandoned after the fall of Humayta.
The Marquis of Caxias then left the army on account of illness, and
was replaced by the nephew of the Emperor, the young Count d’Eu,
who was also marshal of the empire. The count took by assault the
new capital of the enemy, (the city of Pirebeburg,) then chased Lopez
from the first chain of mountains in which he had taken refuge,
destroyed the remainder of his army in the battle of Campo Grande,
and finally pursued him to the extreme limits of the republic.

Lopez, whose men had been reduced to a few hundred, was surprised
in his encampment on the 1st of March, 1870, by the Brazilian troops.*
As soon as he perceived the enemy he mounted a horse and fled, while
his companions fought desperately. As he was about to reach the edge
of a dense forest, in which he hoped to save himself, the soldiers of the
Brazilian cavalry fired upon him, preferring to kill him rather than
allow him to escape. ‘To say nothing of his never having conducted his
troops personally into battle, Lopez had not even the courage to defend
himself when attacked, and, like most tyrants, died the miserable death
of acoward. With his decease ended the long struggle in which were
sacrificed 200,000 Paraguayans, about 80,000 Brazilians, and 10,000
Argentines and Uruguayans. Brazil, besides, expended nearly two
thousand millions of franes.

*The last operations of the war with Paraguay was exclusively the work of the
Brazilian army.
188 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO It.

The gratitude of the Brazilian people to their sovereign, and of the |
imperial government to the troops and victorious generals, was mani- —
fested in an admirable manner. A sum of three millions of francs was
collected by a national subscription to raise a statue to Dom Pedro, but
the modest Emperor devoted this amount to the good of public instrue-
tion; the Marshal Caxias, already a marquis, was made a duke, (the
only one in Brazil;) Count d@’Eu, being already marshal of the army,
was, upon his return to the capital of the empire, the object of brilliant
ovations: the fetes celebrated by the city in his honor and in that of
the army lasted three days, and cost about two millions of franes. On
this occasion the Emperor expressed to the army his happiness and
gratitude by embracing the commander and one of the soldiers of each
battalion. Several of the generals received, with promotion in rank,
titles of nobility; among others, General Osorio was successively made
baron, viscount, count, and marquis (do Herval): he was also accorded
an annual pension of about 20,000 frances, in addition to his pay as
general of the army. General Camara, the conqueror of Lopez, was
made viscount (de Pelotas), and also received a pension of 20,000 franes.
To the officers of the volunteer corps the government accorded honorary
promotion, and preference in the nomination to public employ; finally,
every volunteer soldier (there were about 30,000) received the sum of
800 franes, besides a certain portion of land in the interior of Brazil.

IX.

The enormous sacrifices Brazil was forced to make to sustain the war,
which lasted much longer than was at the beginning anticipated, deter-
mined the political party which came into power during the hostilities
to propose to the Emperor to conclude peace before the fall of Lopez;
but Dom Pedro under these circumstances manifested the most ardent
patriotism and at the same time great political discernment. He never
lost faith in the ultimate success of his arms, although the enemy em-
ployed every means of resistance the most unscrupulous despotism
could invent under the vail of patriotism; he, moreover, understood
better than any one else the importance of giving a severe lesson to
Paraguay, this natural ally of the constant enemies of Brazil—the re-
publics of South America. So strong was his conviction in this respect,
that he would not hear of peace, and even went so far as to declare form-
ally he would abdicate rather than parley with such a foe; affording
thus an example of self-abnegation and patriotic energy worthy to be
placed by the side of that given by Appius Claudius, (the blind,) who
was nota king, it is true, but a member of the famous Roman senate,
which, by its dignified bearing in the presence of misfortune, appeared
to the messenger of Pyrrhus an assembly of kings. ‘I have for along
time,” indignantly exclaimed the illustrious blind old man, ‘ complained
of the gods because they deprived me of sight, but now I thank them,
and even regret that they did not make me deaf also, that I might not

hear such disgraceful proposals. Our fathers thought not of peace un-
der such circumstances; on the contrary, the greater the danger, the
greater their heroism and perseverance. It is thus they became great!”
The Emperor would no more make peace with Lopez than the Roman
senate with the king of Epirus.

Another circumstance also proved both how much Dom Pedro had at
heart the reparation of the affront to his country, and the entire confi-
dence he had in final victory: After the reverse of Curupaity, he had
confided the chief command of the Brazilian troops to the head of the
conservative party, Marshal Caxias, a measure which was approved by
the liberal ministry under Senator Zacarias. Some time after, the re-
ciprocal confidence between the general and this body was disturbed
to such a degree that both offered to resign; but the Emperor was able
to produce a reconciliation, and thus to secure the judgment and skill
of the general, which he deemed absolutely necessary for the success of
the imperial arms. Still a certain opposition began to be manifest, both
in the press and the chamber, by the minority of the liberal party, to the
marshal, who was accused of being too slow in his military operations.
This increased more and more, and even extended to the ministry; the
_ latter shortly after, disagreeing with the Emperor in regard to the choice
of a senator, (a choice exclusively reserved for the sovereign by the con-
Stitution,) again offered their resignation, which was this time accepted,

Dom Pedro was now obliged to choose between a new liberal ministry,
which could inspire the confidence neither of the general-in-chief nor
yet of those who were opposed to him, and a conservative ministry
which would be willing to afford the marshal every possible means to
secure the victory. These considerations decided the Emperor in favor
of the latter, which was presided over by the Viscount de Itaborahy,
who was obliged to dissolve the Chamber of Deputies for refusing to
support him (July, 1868).

The conduct of the Emperor towards vanquished Paraguay proved
that he had been animated by no feeling of hatred for that unhappy
country; on the contrary, it afforded another evidence of his proverbial
magnanimity, for he voluntarily pledged himself after the war to keep
the country independent for ten ) ears, on account of the feeble state to
which it had been reduced.

De

The war did not prevent the imperial government from taking all the
administrative measures the circumstances would allow to increase the
prosperity of the country. The navigation of the Amazon was opened
to foreign nations; new lines of railroad were projected, and the con-
struction of those which. had been commenced was not allowed to be
_interrupted; in a word, progress continued with a firm and assured pace,
and, except a slight increase in the rights of dower and of land and per-
sonal taxes, absolutely nothing indicated that the nation was engaged
190 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO II.

in a formidable contest. Commercial transactions received such an —
impulse that large fortunes were made as if by enchantment.

One fact is worthy of being recited: In the last year of the war, when —
the army and the squadron were reduced because the strength of the
enemy was not as great, the custom-house revenue of Rio Janeiro (about
300,000 franes a day) was sufficient to cover the expense of the war; so
that the campaign against Paraguay not only exhibited the patriotism,
the strength, and the perseverance of the Brazilians, but also the im-
mense resources of their country. :

Peace concluded, the government, far from resting upon its laurels,
employed every means to draw from the experience gained during the
war knowledge that would be useful in the future, and render the
country better able to meet with promptitude attacks from its turbu-
lent neighbors or other nations. The leaders who had most distin-
guished themselves upon land and sea during the war were consulted
as to the best measures for this end; and, in accordance with the in-
formation received from them, new iron-clad vessels were ordered, among
which should be mentioned the frigate Independencia, still in course
of construction at London, and one of the largest in the world;*
the army was re-organized ; the mode of recruiting by force, hitherto
employed, was replaced by the system of conscription ; corporal punish-
ment, so derogatory to human dignity, was abolished, and the pay of
the officers was increased a third.

Perhaps the most urgent need felt by the country after the war was
the resupply of the farming population of this vast empire, relatively
depopulated by the loss of a hundred thousand men, for the most part
cultivators of the soil. The solution of this great problem depended
for the most part, if not absolutely, upon the settlement of another im-
portant question, the abolition of slavery, which had for several years
been a subject of especial solicitude with Dom Pedro, not only on ac-
count of his well-known ideas of philanthropy, but also because he
was assured of what he constantly endeavored to convince his ministers,
that all efforts to establish a current of emigration toward Brazil, such
as that toward the United States, would be useless as long as slavery

existed. Both the liberal and conservative party at last understood the — :

necessity of immediate attention to this difficult and delicate question.

Abolitional ideas had for a long time in fact been entertained by phi-
lanthropic minds in Brazil. Several societies called “ liberators ” had
been formed for the purpose of freeing a certain number of slaves each
year. Many provincial and municipal associations of the empire fol-
lowed this good example, and every day negroes were liberated by in-
dividual owners; in a word, the current of public opinion had become
too strong to be arrested, and the Emperor, who rejoiced in the course
events had taken, determined to seize the first opportunity of satisfy-

ing not only his own philosophical and benevolent views in this matter,

but also the desires of a large portion of his people.

As soon as the war with Paraguay was ended he called the attention
of the conservative minister (Itaborahy,) then at the head of government-
al affairs, to the subject. The minister, although he did not believe in
the sudden and radical enfranchisement such as had taken place in

_the United States, thought the children of slave parents should be freed,
- but he had not the courage to take the responsibility of maintaining

this opinion in opposition to the numerous and wealthy planters, many
of whom held seats in Parliament or were electors. He preferred to send
his resignation to the Emperor, which was eagerly accepted. The minis-
ter who succeeded him was also obliged to retire at the end of four

- months on account of the opposition, more and more threatening, of the

slaveholders. What was to be done? Wait until the liberal party,
which had inscribed this reform upon their programme, came into power?
But how was it possible to wait ?

Under these circumstances the Emperor offered the ministry to the
Viscount Rio Branco, a man well known on account of his political ability
and an especial talent for conciliating unruly spirits. The viscount
carried out, although not without great trouble, the views of the EKm-
peror and the Brazilian nation, and on the 28th of September, 1871,
was passed by the Parliament the law known under the name of the

free womb.” This legislative act, which declared the children born of

slave-women after that day to be free, and required the owner of the
parents for a slight indemnity to maintain the childrea until the age of

‘twenty, was received with indescribable enthusiasm by all Brazil, with

the exception only of the slaveholders, who held their pecuniary interests
above those of their country and of humanity. The government received
from all the various corporations, political or civil, and the religious so-
cieties, benevolent or otherwise, the most ardent promises of support
and warm congratulation. In this universal feeling of contentment
the generous promoter of this wise law, Dom Pedro II, was not forgotten,

_ although at the time absent from the country, as we shall see.

XI.

Dom Pedro had for a long time wished to visit Europe, but the ac-

- complishment of his desire had been postponed, at one time by troubles

at home, at another by differences with foreign nations, and when at
jast the country was in a condition to allow this excursion, much to be
desired on account of relations with foreign powers, the Emperor com-
menced his journey by passing through the provinces of his own em-
pire he had not yet visited, thus showing himself true to his especial
maxim, Brazil first of all.

Not only did the victory over Paraguay, which insured external peace
by affording sufficient proof to the turbulent neighbors of Brazil that
war against her could only end to their disadvantage, and the interior |

order of the country not disturbed since 1848, seem especially opportune —
for the execution of this project of a voyage to Hurope, but Ee health
of the Empress required the journey.

According to the Brazilian constitution the sovereign cannot leave the
country without permission of parliament, under pain of forfeiting the
empire. Dom Pedro asked and obtained leave of absence for a year,
and started for Europe in the month of May, 1871, under the name of
Dom Pedro @Aleantara, confiding the regency of the empire to his
daughter, the Countess d’Eu. He sailed with the Empress and a suite
of ten persons on board the English steamer which passes regularly
between Rio de Janeiro and Southampton, for he would not spend a —
centime more than the allowance of a civil officer, which, by the way,
is not great—2,000,000 frances a year. The entire population of Rio
turned out to wish him a happy journey, and a speedy return. They
collected upon the quay, in the windows facing the port, upon the roofs
of the houses, on the islands of the bay, waving their handkerchiefs as
he appeared, and filled the numerous small steamboats which were to
escort for some distance the vessel containing the august travelers.
These sincere and touching adieus showed how much the people loved —
their sovereign.

The first stopping place of the imperial tourists was Lisbon. Upon
the arrival of the Emperor, Louis I, his nephew, came to meet him, and
offered to suspend the rules of quarantine and conduct him immediately
to his palace. Dom Pedro firmly determined to travel as a private gen-
tleman, not only refused to accept this offer, but also to pass the four
days of quarantine in a man-of-war the King placed at his disposal. He
lodged therefore in the common lazaretto with all the passengers who
had landed at Lisbon. He passed several days in the beautiful capital,
and then went by rail to Spain, promising his royal nephew to pass ¢
few days in Portugal on his return to Brazil. After Spain he visited
France, England, Belgium, Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Italy, and
Egypt. He took advantage of his journey to lay the foundations of sev-
eral treaties of commerce and friendship, but particularly of extradition,
which were afterwards consummated.

In these different countries, of which he knew as much as could be
learned from written descriptions, Dom Pedro made a careful examina-
tion of the works of art, of science, and of industry, the schools, univer-
sities, and scientific societies, whose: meetings he delighted to attend.
He invited to his table distinguished men of all classes, and surprised
more than one Diogenes in his tub. Everywhere and to everybody,
he exhibited much more knowledge than is generally possessed by the

heads of nations, and on his return to Brazil, honored with the most |

distinguished decorations the men of letters, arts, and science with
whom he had been in relation. In certain charitable institutions and —
in the poor quarter of several large cities, he left substantial souvenirs —
of his visit.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO II. 193

Dom Pedro was decorated on this journey with the order of the gar-
ter, and also received diplomas from several learned societies, among
which we may mention that of member of the natural history section
of the French Institute, a deserved reward for his profound study of
this branch of knowledge. In short, the journey was a success, and of
great importance to Brazil, as the Emperor was enabjed to refute the
errors that superficial or malevolent writers had spread all over Europe
in regard to the country.*

Dom Pedro quitted Europe with the firm determination to return at
some future time, and visit the countries of the north as well as Turkey.

XII.

The return of Dom Pedro to Brazil gave the people another oppor-
tunity of showing their attachment, by an enthusiastic welcome, and a
brilliant reception at the capital. One of his first acts was to abolith
the system of vassalage which had descended from the ancient kings
of Portugal. Then he hastened to introduce every useful art and cus-
tom he had seen abroad compatible with the climate, institutions, and
national habits of the country. The capitalin this way was embellished
with numerous erections, which at the same time responded to the
requirements of public comfort. t

Brazil was then united by the telegraph with Europe, the United
States, and the republics of La Plata. Several other works of public
interest, such as the construction of new railways and the opening of
new roads, &c., were undertaken or received new impulse from the gov-
ernment. For the better success of his plans for material improvement,
Dom Pedro nominated as minister of public works, of commerce, and
of agriculture the Senator Viscount de Itatina, who had accompanied
him on his voyage to Europe, and was, in consequence, the best inter-
preter of the desires of the Emperor.

In political and intellectual affairs there was radical reform, especially
in the reorganization of primary schools, of higher, schools, and the re-
vision of the electoral law.

The solicitude Dom Pedro had always felt in regard to public instruc-
tion, proves conclusively how entirely he was convinced that it is the

*It may be well to give here the opinion of Professor Agassiz in regard to these
errors: “Like every country,” he says, “struggling for recognition among the self-
reliant nations ef the world, Brazil has to contend with the prejudiced reports of a
floating foreign population, indifferent to the welfare of the land they temporarily in-
habit, and whose appreciations are mainly influenced by private interest. It is much
to be regretted that the government has not thought it worth while to take decided

' Measures to correct the erroneous impressions current abroad concerning its admin-

istration, and that its diplomatic agents do so little to circulate truthful and author-
itative statements of their domestic concerns.”—(A Journey in Brazil, by Professor and
Mrs. Agassiz.)

tAmong the public constructions at Rio especially remarkable, are the foundling
asylum, the hospital of Mercy, the military school, the primary schools, the exchange,
the public treasury.

condition sine qua non of all real and lasting progress. It is, therefore,
not surprising that during his journey his attention should have been
especially directed to this branch of public administration. After adopt-
ing the methods and programmes of study which seemed to him the
best, he caused a number of really palatial buildings to be erected, with
spacious gardens attached, to be used as public schools for children of
both sexes; and in order to render study agreeable, the luxury and
provisions for comfort in these establishments were so great as to be
condemned as extravagance by those opposed to the projects of the
Emperor.

In the high schools, reform was introduced in the regulation of exam-
inations. These were rendered so much more difficult as to excite the
manifest hostility of the students; but the increased rigor was really
necessary, as the diplomas conferred by the scientific corporations had
ceased to be regarded with much confidence.

The central school was reorganized and converted into a polytechnic
institution, similar to the Belgian schools for engineers. Lastly, a school
of mines was formed in the province of Minas, the richest in precious
minerals, and now it is proposed to found at Rio a university, with due
consideration, however, for the faculties of law and medicine existing in
the provinces.

The reform of the electoral law is one of the greatest benefits Brazil
has received from the very hand, so to say, of the present Emperor. The
old law was full of flaws, which might allow a party in power to remain
so. continually, were it not for the prerogatives accorded the Emperor by
the constituiion. No party at the head of the administration had desired
to reform this law, precisely because of the advantage to be drawn from
its defects, but once in the opposition, there was no want of condemna-
tion of the frauds and violence committed by the agents and friends of
the government during the elections. ;

The greatest inconveniences resulting from this defective law were,
ou the one hand, the impossibility of knowing whether the parliamentary
majority represented really the opinion of the people, and on the other
the want of any security that the minority would be represented. Also,
every dissolution of the houses of parliament was followed by a unan-
imous chamber, evidently the creation of the minister; and even if this
had not the general support, it could always exercise great influence upon
legislative decisions, because of its power over a large number of public
functionaries; that is to say, on account of the number of public offices _
at its disposal.

Tor the purpose not only of putting an end to the complaints of par-
ties not in power, but also and principally to govern in accordance with
the real desires of the nation—the first duty of every honest govern-
ment—Dom Pedro determined to reform the electoral law, and on the
occasion of the opening of parliament in 1874, entered into a formal
engagement to prevent, in the future, electoral abuses.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO II. Hey be

The liberal party desired election by one degree, that is, direct elec-
tion; but the constitution positively required election by two degrees,
that is, indirect. This was an insurmountable obstacle to the Emperor,
for he knew that too frequent alteration of the organic laws of a country
ends in political disorganization. He therefore confined his attention
to such changes in the old system as would render parliament more

- jndependent of the government. Among the improvements of the new

law was the decree that the holding of the office of representative was
incompatible with the tenure of any other charge remunerated by the
state, and that the government could not nominate any deputy or sena-
tor to an office six months before or after the elections. Should this
loyal attempt at reform by the Emperor be unsuccessful, we are con-
vinced he would propose to the people to change the constitution, rather
than have the national vote continually misconstrued.

XIII.

Almost immediately after the return of Dom Pedro to Brazil, toward
the end of the year 1872, occurred an event known under the name of
the religious question, of which we must give a brief account, for, although
much to be regretted, it gave proof of the moderation of the Brazilian
monarch, and his respect for the national institutions.

The bishop of Pernambuco, (Mgr. Vital de Oliveira,) who had received
his religious education at Rome, where he had been nominated to ofiice
at the age of 28, forgetting the maxim of Talleyrand, “ above all, no zeal,”
came to Brazil with the predetermination, it would seem, to suppress
Free Masonry in his diocese, which had not been attempted by the ten
preceding bishops nor by the primate of Brazil; for they knew that,
under the form in which it existed in the empire, it was not hostile to the
Catholic religion. The conduct of the young bishop, whom the Pope at
the time called too hot-headed, is so extraordinary that we transcribe liter-
ally that document, the cause of the disturbance which followed, in order
that the reader may judge of it for himself.

On the 28th of December, 1872, Mgr. Vital de Oliveira sent to the
vicar of the parish of Saint Antoine (at Pernambuco) an order conceived
as follows: ‘It has come to our knowledge that Doctor Costa Ribeiro,
well known as a Free Mason, is a member of the fraternity of the Trés
Saint Sacrement of this parish; and as the initiated of the order of
Masonry are under the ban of high excommunication imposed upon
them by several of the Popes, we order you, without delay, to see the
judge of the fraternity, and command him in our name to exhort, kindly
but instantly, the Brother Costa Ribeiro to abjure this sect condemned
by the church. If, unhappily, he refuse to retract, let him be immedi-
ately expelled from the fraternity, inasmuch as excommunicants are
excluded from it by ecclesiastical institutions. Let the same course be
pursued with regard to any other Free Mason who niay be a member not
only of this, but of any other fraternity in the parish.”

(Signed, etc.)
196 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO II.

The fraternity, in united council, decided to beseech the bishop to with-
draw this order as being doubly illegal. It required what was in fact
contrary to the organic rules of the fraternity, which authorized no
expulsion of its members on account of being Masons, and contrary
also tq the constitution of Brazil, which required (article 102, § 14) that
apostolic letters and other ecclesiastical mandates must receive the con-
firmation of the government before they could be carried into execution.
Now, the order condemning Masonry had not been authorised with the
imperial seal; besides, the fraternities were not only religious but civil
orders, and in the latter capacity did not come under the authority of
the chureh. An order such as that of the bishop of Pernambuco had
never before been given by any of the bishops of the empire, Masonry
in Brazil haying the same legal title to existence as any other society
whatever. .

Notwithstanding these considerations, which the fraternity endeav-
ored to impress upon the bishop, the latter persisted in his design, and
ended by pronouncing the sentence of interdiction, by which the mem-
bers of the fraternity were forbidden to appear in any religious cere-
mony whatever with the insignia of the society. The fraternity en-
treated the bishop in vain to withdraw this severe and illegal restric-
tion; they then carried it, as an abuse, to the crown, founding their
appeal upon the requirement of the constitution which had been dis.
regarded.

The government, wishing to act with prudence and justice, consulted
the council of state, which was of the opinion that the bishop had abused
his authority in requiring the expulsion of the masonic members of the
fraternity, and in pronouncing against the society the sentence of inter-
diction, inasmuch as the organic laws of the fraternity were under the su-
pervision of the civil authority, the bishop having only the right toapprove
and control those appertaining to religious matters. Jn consequence of
this decision the government ordered the bishop to withdraw, within a
month, the sentence of interdiction. The bishop not only refused obe-
dience himself to this requirement, but enjoined the same on his vicars,
under threat of suspension ex informata conscientia, a threat he im-
mediately executed upon one of them who merely seemed irresolute.
He besides declared in a public address that he had not taken the de-
mands of the constitution into account, as he recognized no higher au-
thority than that of the church. This act of real rebellion obliged the
government to prosecute the bishop for disobedience to the laws, but
this was not done without again consulting the council of state, this
time in full conclave. An embassador was at the same time sent to

tome to demand the support of the Pope against the refractory bishop,
which proves conclusively that the imperial government desired to re-
main on good terms with the religious power. The Emperor was, besides,
quite ready to remit any penalty the tribunal might impose upon the
bishop, if the Pope induced the prelate to withdraw the interdiction.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO II. 197

The Pope, having probably been made to understand this, wrote a
letter to the bishop expressing disapproval of his conduct and ordering
him to withdraw the interdiction, but the prelate did not obey, under
the pretext that the Pope had been misinformed in regard to the matter.
The prosecution continued and the bishop was condemned to four years
of hard labor, but the Emperor hastened to commute this punishment to
four years of imprisonment.

During the prosecution the bishop of Para, following the conduct of
his colleague of Pernambuco, was subjected to the like process. The
affair then assumed a violent character both in the press and in parlia-
ment, where, however, the majority supported the government. The
bishop from his prison—a palace situated on a beautiful fortified penin-
sula opposite Rio, in which he moved freely and was allowed to see any
one who wished to visit him, and was treated like a prince—succeeded,
by the intervention of ecclesiastical agents, in exciting the peasants of
his diocese to a rebellion, happily soon repressed.

Notwithstanding the evident connivance of the bishop with these dis-
turbanees, the government forbore any further prosecution of him, in
order to spare the Emperor the pain of seeing this high functionary con-
demned to more severe punishment. We can readily understand this
feeling in a monarch, raised in the Catholic religion, with Catholic sub-
jects, and who had taken the oath on ascending the throne to maintain
the Catholic religion, which is the religion of State. Jurthermore, Dom
Pedro did not allow the term of imprisonment imposed by the high court
of justice for the bishops to expire, but pardoned them at the end of two
years. To this act of clemency the Pope responded by removing the in-
terdiction pronounced by the bishops against the fraternities, and re-
ligious peace was restored to the empire.

XIV.

During the legislative session of 1875, Dom Pedro, taking advantage
of the tranquillity of the country at home and fearing no trouble from
abroad, demanded and obtained from parliament a leave of eighteen
months. His purpose was to complete the tour commenced in 1871,
and to visit’ the universal exposition held that year in Philadelphia,
(United States of America.) Foreseeing this long absence, Dom Pedro
had, after the retirement of the minister Rio Branco, (June, 1875,) nomi-
nated as his successor the old Marshal Duke de Caxias, who had twice

been president of the cabinet, and who enjoyed a high reputation, well

merited by his victories in Paraguay and over the enemies of the
internal peace of the country. The duke had as colleague in the min-
ister of foreign affairs the Baron Cotegipe, well known to possess an
amount of energy, quite uncommon among Brazilian statesmen, espe-
cially displayed during the hostilities with the neighboring republics.

- Having thus confided the government of his empire to a ministry of
tried men and to the regency of the princess, the successor to the throne,
198 BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO II.

Dom Pedro left for the United States the latter part of last March,
and at the moment of writing we know that he has received a most
flattering welcome from the country of Washington and Franklin, not
only on the part of public authorities, (although he desired to preserve
a rigorous incognito,) but also by the press and the people of that pow-
erful republic. We are sure that Dom Pedro is convinced by this re-
ception of the sincerity—he has, however, never doubted—of the desire
of the great republics of North America to maintain cordial relations
with the great empire of South America, a policy perfectly in unison
with the spirit of the people and the proud reserve of one of their most
able representatives, Monroe, who repudiated all European intervention
in America, wishing the continent to belong to Americans alone.

From the United States Dom Pedro took passage for Europe, where
there is no doubt as cordial a reception awaits him as he received in
that country five years ago.

XV.

A few words before closing this sketch in regard to the personal char-
acteristics of Dom Pedro, both as a man and as a Sovereign.

In respect to physique, he is tall, well formed, with light hair and
complexion; he has blue eyes, a benevolent expression, and wears a
full-grown beard, which is very gray, much more so than his hair; his
whole appearance is attractive and his manner sympathetic; he will
be fifty-one years of age next December.

Dom Pedro’s activity is extraordinary. He rises at 6 o’clock, reads
certain news journals, while his secretary looks over others, and marks
passages worthy of consideration, attends to business until half past 9,
breakfasts rapidly,* then gives audience to the public; after which he
generally visits the schools, arsenals, fortresses, or attends a session of
@ Scientific society, &c.t He dines at 5, again gives audience to the
people, and then resumes business,t if he does not go to the theater, (of
which he is very fond,) to a concert, a ball, or some private entertain-
ment. He never retires before midnight.

When visiting the establishments for instruction, whether private or _
belonging to the state, in the capital or in the provinces, he assists in
the examination of the pupils and in the distribution of prizes, and
makes note on these occasions of the name, family, and place of birth

* He never remains more than half an hour at breakfast, nor at dinner, and has at his
table all his personal attendants, who are on duty for a week.

t Dom Pedro never fails to be present at the reunions of the Brazilian Institution of
History and Geography, of which he is the honorary president.

He has a library, and a very complete laboratory for natural and physical science.
Besides the study of these branches, as well as of political and moral science, he is
much interested in ancient literature. In asynagogue in London, during his visit in
1871, he delighted the rabbins by translating a page of their Hebrew Bible.

BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH OF DOM PEDRO II. 199

of those who distinguish themselves in their studies. More than one
thus noticed has afterward found in the Emperor a powerful protector.*

Dom Pedro not only encourages letters and the arts, he also renders
important aid to industrial societies of general utility, either trom his
own purse, by the purchase of shares, or by demanding subsidy for them
from the legislative bodies.t

He presides twice a week at the council of state. The session com-
mences at 9 o’clock in the evening, and lasts sometimes until 1 in the
morning. Each minister gives an account in his presence of all the
matters in his department requiring the imperial signature; the Em-
peror listens with attention, and occasionally asks for some explanation.
If the matter is of importance, especially if it touches the rights or the
purses of the citizens, he will not allow a decision on the same day, but
takes time to study the subject carefully, giving his opinion at the next
session. If it is a radical innovation he employs a longer time in exam-
ining all its details, consults the council of state, and adopts it at last
only if convinced that it is really and intelligently desired, and will be
of profit to the people; for his long experience in the government of
men has taught him that reform must be carefully considered, must be
opportune and very evidently beneficial before it is adopted, in order
that progress may be made. In this respect he is a liberal conservative,
as every head of a nation should be who desires to respect the laws and
at the same time advance civilization.

One would suppose from this active interference of the Emperor in
the affairs of state, that the ministry exercises but little power. But
this is not the case, for the Emperor has for the constitution, and for the
public offices it creates, an almost religious respect. It is sufficient to
say that he has not once during his long reign made use of the veto
power given him by the constitution. He has never forced his own
wishes upon any of his ministers; he leaves them entire freedom of
action. But this very respect for the laws of the nation, as well as his
own experience, has taught him the necessity of exercising his sover-
eign attributes, which he does, taking counsel only of his own conscience.

This loyal conduct, this benevolent interference on the part of the
sovereign in the affairs of the country, has nevertheless been attacked

* We are glad to give the following example: When M. Carlos Gomes, a Brazilian
composer, after completing his studies in the school of fine arts at Rio and at Rome
played for the first time, in the Brazilian capital, his beautiful opera Le Guarany, which
had been very successful in Italy and London, he was summoned to the imperial box
and warmly congratulated by the Emperor, who gave him at the same time the diploma
and the badge of an officer of the order of the Rose set in diamonds.

t There exist in Brazil not less than eighteen lines of steamboats, supplied by the
state, representing a value of 9,000,750 francs a year, without counting 568,000 francs
contributed annually to the United States and Brazil Mail Steamship Company, whose
vessels run every month between Rio and the United States, stopping at several Bra-
zilian ports. As to the railroad lines, we know they have nearly all a security of 7 per
cent.

as unconstitutional, as too personal a government. Those who pretend —
that the control of a nation should be left exclusively to the ministers —
and parliamentary majorities, rest upon the celebrated maxim: “ The —
constitutional king reigns, but does not govern.” This is not the place to dis-
cuss this important question, but as to the maxim we cannot refrain from
declaring, with Guizot, that it has no solid foundation. IfM. Thiers ut-
tered it, when in the opposition, it is very certain he would not defend it
to-day, since his experience at the head of the French nation. It was the
constitution of England, which in some sort deprives the sovereign of
political action by the existence of a constituent and all powerful parlia-
ment, which led him to make this statement. But even with such a
constitution, the distinction, as made by the Emperor between the attri-

butes of the head of the nation, of its ministers, and of the national parlia- — |

ment, is absolute, as M. Thiershimself proved by his conduct in the con-
stituent assembly of Versailles, during his government of the country
from 1871 to 1873. It is, moreover, very easy to show the nonsense of —
the remark by substituting for the word reign its true significance, as
given by the good Lettré, in his remarkable dictionary: “To reign,” he
says, “is to govern a state under the title of king, queen, emperor, elect-
or, prince, or duke.” Now, is it not nonsense to say the king governs,
but does not govern ?

The maxim, moreover, is not in accordance with the Brazilian
constitution, which confers upon the sovereign not only control over
the political powers governing the nation, but also especial attributes
to be exercised by him exclusively. The accusation therefore that the
Emperor is illegal in his personal government is without foundation.

We have seen that Dom Pedro gives audience to the public twice a
day. On these occasions he exhibits the qualities of a truly liberal soy-
ereign, and shows that he cares as much for the interests of his Brazil-

ian family as for his own. In fact, he receives every one, foreigners or
his own people, with affability and kindness, pressing the hand of |

those he regards especially. If an artist or a savant presents himself,
Dom Pedro does not allow him to depart without some conversation
upon his especial pursuit; if one of his acquaintances, he inquires with
interest for the health of the different members of his family and inter-
changes with him some familiar and pleasant remarks. To claimants —
he has become somewhat reserved in manner on account of the great
number who have imposed upon his kindness, and also because he does —
not wish to encroach upon the attributes of his ministers. Still, he —
listens with patience and attention ; making from time to time an objec- —
tion, or giving counsel; but he does not trouble the ministers with
their pretensions, unless justice, equity, or benevolence require. If a
complaint is made to him either from subaltern officials, who are very ~
apt to suppose injustice has been done when they have not been pro-
moted fast enough to suit their supposed deserts, from a disappointed
oflice-seeker, or from any one whatever, Dom Pedro takes the trouble

to inquire into and discuss the cause of his discontent. He endeavors
to reconcile as much as possible the duties his political position impose
upon him with his own inclinations, which always lead him to clemency
and benevolence. Thus every year, on the occasion of certain religious,
national, and dynamic festivals, he pardons the condemned and the
criminals.

Altheugh the penal law of Brazil authorizes the punishment of death,
it was very seldom used in the commencement of his reign, and has
not once been imposed during the last twenty years. What Dom Pedro
has most at heart, is the manner in which justice is administered in his
empire.* Thus one day, when a complainant had the audacity to tell
him that one of his ministers had done him an injustice, he answered
with some asperity, ‘‘ My ministers never do an injustice.” But ina
moment resuming his natural benevolence, he added, “I will examine
into your affair,” and the next day reparation was made, the case being
one of the few not without foundation.

The following incident in the life of Dom Pedro shows how ready he is
to pardon offenses even against himself personally. A young lawyer of
talent, desiring probably to attract the attention of the controlling minds
of the country, wrote a pamphlet against the Emperor and all the house
of Bragance, in language much too violent to be sincere; nevertheless, he
became later successively a deputy, a minister, a councilor of state, a
senator for life, and received a title of nobility. There was a cry of
corruption on account of his advancement from the opponents of the
Emperor, although he had retracted the substance of his pamphlet, and
did not enter into the various offices until long after its publication. The
truth is, he owes the position he to-day occupies to his real talent and
to the magnanimity of his sovereign, who would not place the least
obstacle in the way of his elevation, especially after his retraction, and
since he devoted his talents to the service of his country, instead of
employing them to defame her institutions and her rulers.
