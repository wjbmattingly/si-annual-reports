REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF THE
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

C. G. ABBOT
FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 1942

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith my report show-
ing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and the
Government bureaus under its administrative charge during the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1942. The first 23 pages contain a summary
account of the affairs of the Institution, and appendixes 1 to 11
give more detailed reports of the operations of the National Museum,
the National Gallery of Art, the National Collection of Fine Arts, the
Freer Gallery of Art, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Inter-
national Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, the Astrophysical
Observatory, which now includes the Division of Radiation and
Organisms, the Smithsonian library, and of the publications issued
under the direction of the Institution. On page 99 is the financial
report of the executive committee of the Board of Regents.

THE SMITHSONIAN AND THE WAR

In my last report I stated that in the fiscal year 1941 the Smithson-
ian had been assigned several problems connected with national
defense and stood ready to devote all its resources to such work when
called upon. After Pearl Harbor, calls upon the Institution for
special information relating to the war increased rapidly, and early in
1942 I appointed a War Committee for the purpose of exploiting
every facility of the Institution in aiding the war effort. Such a
highly specialized organization as the Smithsonian obviously can only
undertake those things which its staff is trained and equipped to do,
but the exploratory investigations of the War Committee revealed
a surprisingly wide range of activities in which the Institution could
engage that are directly or indirectly of real service in the war effort.

For some organizations whose normal] activities are in fields directly
applicable to war work, such for example as those concerned with
strategic materials or those with large physical laboratories, the prob-
lem of going over to a war footing is solved for them. For such

1
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

establishments as the Smithsonian, with its normal functions of
research, chiefly in the natural sciences, publication of results of scien-
tific researches, museum and art gallery exhibition, and international
exchange of literature, the problem is not so simple. Every member
of the staff desires earnestly to do his utmost to aid in the war effort,
but in many instances, as the following summary of Smithsonian
war activities shows, the only possible way of putting the desire into
effect. is connected only indirectly with war work. Nevertheless,
work such as that which the Smithsonian is qualified to perform will,
T believe, be seen to fill a definite place in the Nation’s all-out war
effort.

The membership of the War Committee is as follows: C. W. Mit-
man, engineer, chairman; L. B. Aldrich, physicist; W. N. Fenton,
ethnologist; Herbert Friedmann, biologist; and W. P. True, chief,
editorial division. For several weeks the committee met every day
in the effort to speed up the diversion of as much as possible of the
Institution’s work into war channels. Several questionnaires were
sent to the staff asking for suggestions and detailed information as
to the qualifications, travel, and special knowledge of each member.
With these data before them, the committee began to make recom-
mendations, most of which I approved and put into effect. Those
projects which had been initiated up to June 30, 1942, are as follows:

1. The Institution has prepared a detailed roster of the scientific
staff totaling nearly 100 scientists, listing their geographic and special-
ized knowledge. Some of this knowledge has proved to be readily
available nowhere else, and the roster has been extensively used in
connection with inquiries from war agencies.

2. A record of requests from war agencies for specific informa-
tion from individual staff members shows a total of 460 such received
since Pearl Harbor. Fifty percent came directly from the War and
Navy Departments, the rest from 25 different other war agencies.
In short, the Smithsonian is serving as an important source of tech-
nical and geographic information.

3. The Smithsonian, together with the National Research Council,
the American Council of Learned Societies, and the Social Science
Research Council, has actively participated in the setting up of the
Ethnogeographic Board. The Institution furnishes financial sup-
port and facilities, and serves as the headquarters for the Board,
whose purpose is to provide a central clearinghouse for information
to Army and Navy Intelligence and other war agencies in the fields
of geography, languages, and social sciences. Dr. William Duncan
Strong, formerly of the Bureau of American Ethnology and now a
member of the staff of Columbia University, was appointed director
of the Board. Members of the staff of the Institution are cooperat-
ing closely in the work.
REPORT OF THB SECRETARY 3

4, The Smithsonian has thousands of published and unpublished
photographs taken by its scientists in all parts of the world, includ-
ing many out-of-the-way places not commonly photographed. An
index is being compiled of the published material, and members of
the staff have put their photographic files in shape for ready con-
sultation by war agencies. Many of its photographs have already
been so consulted.

5. In the very important field of Latin American cooperation, the
Institution has undertaken two large-scale scientific projects. One
is a Handbook of the Indians of South America, under the editorship
of Dr. Julian H. Steward, of the Bureau of American Ethnology.
The various articles will be contributed by both Latin American and
North American anthropologists. This will be published under the
auspices of the Institution. The other is a list of the insects of
South and Central America, a much-needed tool for all future en-
tomological work in those areas. The completed list, which is esti-
mated to make more than a thousand pages of print, will also appear
as a Smithsonian publication.

6. Approximately 10 percent of the scientific staff are engaged in
full-time war projects assigned to them by the Army, Navy, or
other war agencies. This work is being done either at the Institution
or through transfer of personnel to the agency requesting the work.
All the rest of the staff members devote a portion of their time to
work related directly or indirectly to the war, the actual amount of
time depending on the extent to which their special knowledge is
needed by war agencies.

7. In the line of its normal function of diffusion of knowledge, the
Institution has initiated several wartime projects. A new series of
pamphlets entitled “War Background Studies” and a series of news
releases headed “War Background Data” have as their purpose the
increasing of popular understanding of the various regions and peo-
ples involved in the world conflict. In the Smithsonian’s radio pro-
gram, “The World Is Yours,” four broadcasts were given on a Nation-
wide network comprising a series on the peoples of the United Na-
tions. Several special war exhibits were shown in the Smithsonian
and Museum buildings and others are definitely planned. A series
of special lectures on war topics has been arranged, and at the close
of the fiscal year its beginning awaited only the installation of new
projection equipment in the Museum auditorium. A set of six post-
cards illustrating Museum exhibits was printed for free distribution
to service men; in conjunction with these, writing counters and a mail
box were installed at the entrance to the Arts and Industries Build-
ing where men in uniform write and mail the cards. Thousands of
sets had been given out at the close of the year, and this service

501591--43-—2

4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

seems to be much appreciated. All the Museum buildings are now
open all day Sunday for the benefit of service men and war workers.

8. The War Committee and officials of the Institution have estab-
lished definite contacts with the War and Navy Departments and
other war agencies; through these contacts continual efforts are being
made to channel more war-time researches and other suitable activities
to the Institution.

The War Committee will continue to function for the duration.

ENDING OF WRIGHT-SMITHSONIAN CONTROVERSY

By anticipation, I report with great relief and peculiar satisfaction
the ending of the long controversy between Dr. Orville Wright and
the Smithsonian Institution. Negotiations, in which Colonel Lind-
bergh and others had taken part, had proceeded intermittently be-
tween the Secretary and Dr. Wright since 1928. Since June 1942, in
part with the mediation of Fred C. Kelly, an active interchange of
communications has gone on. It resulted in a statement acceptable
to Dr. Wright which was published by the Institution in its Mis-
cellaneous Collections, volume 103, No. 8, October 24, 1942. This
statement, which speaks for itself, it is intended to republish as the
first article of the Appendix to the Smithsonian Report for 1942. In
his letter of October 17, 1942, Dr. Wright says: “I hope the relations
between the Institution and myself may again be as amicable as they
were in Dr, Langley’s administration.”

SUMMARY OF THE YEAR’S ACTIVITIES OF THE BRANCHES OF
THE INSTITUTION

National Museum.—Accessions for the year totaled 284,582 speci-
mens, bringing the number of catalog entries in all departments to
17,578,240. Among the outstanding accessions may be mentioned the
following: In anthropology, 200 artifacts from the old Indian village
site of Potawomeke, Stafford County, Va.; cult objects from voodoo
shrines in Haiti, and weapons of the Moro of Mindanao, P. I.; in
biology, 80 Antarctic seals, 54 Manchurian mammals, 1,845 birds from
Colombia collected by Dr. Alexander Wetmore and M. A. Carriker,
Jr., 14,219 fishes from the area between Peru and Alaska received
from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service, a collection of
25,000 specimens of Hemiptera received from W. L. McAtee, 7,600
specimens, mostly termites, collected in Jamaica by Dr. Edward A.
Chapin, and 2,169 specimens of plants of Colombia received in con-
tinuation of exchanges from the Instituto de Ciencias Naturales,
Bogota, Colombia; in geology, a large aquamarine from Agua Preta,
Minas Geraes, Brazil, purchased from the Roebling fund, a 2,690-
gram specimen of the Rose City, Mich., stony meteorite presented by
Dr. Stuart H. Perry, 4 tons of limestone blocks of beautifully pre-
served silicified Permian fossils collected in Texas by Dr. G. A.
~

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9)

Cooper, and 8,000 Cambrian and Devonian fossils collected by Dr. C.
E. Resser in Montana, Utah, and the Canadian Rockies; in engineer-
ing and industries, a number of models of historic aircraft, an example
of the Allison liquid-cooled aircraft engine, type V-1710-C, a jeep
lent by the War Department, the first Emerson iron lung completed
in 1931, and a collection of 183 Currier and Ives prints given by Miss
Adele S. Colgate. Although field expeditions were greatly curtailed
because of war conditions, those to which the Museum was previously
committed were carried through with valuable results in specimens
and new information. Visitors to the Museum numbered 2,042,817.
Although this was nearly half a million less than in the previous
year, nevertheless the decrease was less than had been anticipated in
view of restrictions on automobile travel. The Museum issued 44
publications and distributed 82,545 copies during the year. Fifteen
special exhibits were held in the Museum under the auspices of
various scientific and other groups. Among numerous changes in
the staff may be mentioned the retirement, after nearly 39 years of
service, of Dr. Ale’ Hrdlitka as curator of the division of physical
anthropology; Dr. T. Dale Stewart, associate curator of the division,
was promoted to the curatorship to succeed him.

National Gallery of Art—The total attendance at the Gallery for
the first full year of its operation was 2,005,328, a daily average of
over 5,500 visitors. In June the Gallery began a series of Sunday
evening openings for the benefit of service men and war workers.
Concerts and special lectures featured these Sunday openings, which
proved so successful that it was decided to continue them indefinite-
ly. Publications available to the public are a general information
booklet, a catalog of the paintings and sculpture, a book of illustra-
tions of all the works of art in the Gallery, color reproductions, and
postcards. Since Pearl Harbor the Gallery has been blacked out
nightly, and frequent air-raid drills have been held. A limited
number of the most fragile and irreplaceable works of art have been
removed to a place of greater safety, but it is the expressed belief
of the Board of Trustees that the Gallery has a duty to the public
and an obligation as a source of recreation and education to con-
tinue its activities and even increase them in war time. Gifts of
prints, paintings, and sculpture were accepted from eight different
donors, and a number of important loans were received. Seven
special exhibitions were held at the Gallery, including one of draw-
ings of war-time London, another of the art of Australia, and one
of 11 portrait busts of the Presidents of the Republics of South
America, by Jo Davidson. The Gallery’s educational program in-
cluded Gallery tours of the collection conducted twice daily; a series
of 34 special lectures, one given each Saturday afternoon from Octo-
ber to April, and Gallery talks and other lectures dealing with a
6 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

specific school or specific works of art. Beginning in December,
special tours for members of the armed forces were arranged for
Saturday afternoons.

National Collection of Fine Aris—The necessary plans were made
during the year for the protection and evacuation of works of art
in the National Collection. Four oil paintings and a number of
other works of art were accepted for the collection by the Smith-
sonian Art Commission. Three miniatures were acquired through
the Catherine Walden Myer fund. Eight special exhibitions were
held as follows: Miniatures Jent by Count and Countess Bohdan de
Castellane; oils and water colors by Roy M. Mason, N. A.; oils,
prints, and drawings by Antonio Rodriguez Luna, of Mexico; jade
lent by Georges Estoppey; paintings on metal and prints by Buell
Mullen; oils, water colors, and prints by members of the Landscape
Club of Washington, D. C.; plaster busts by Marina Nujfiez del
Prado, of Bolivia; oil paintings, pencil drawings, lithographs, and
water colors by Ignacio Aguirre, of Mexico.

Freer Gallery of Art—Additions to the collections included Per-
sian and Syrian brass; Chinese bronze; Chinese jade; Arabic man-
uscript; Arabic, Chinese, and Persian painting; Arabic, Mesopo-
tamian, Persian, and Syro-Egyptian pottery. The regular work of
the curatorial staff was devoted to the study and recording of these
new acquisitions and other art objects already in the collection. In
addition, 770 objects and 235 photographs of objects were submitted
to the Director by their owners for information as to identity, prov-
enance, quality, date, or inscriptions. Besides this usual work, the
staff devoted much of its time during the winter and spring to work
connected with the war. The total number of visitors to the Gallery
for the year was 87,890. A number of groups were given docent
service in the exhibition galleries and study rooms. Carl Whiting
Bishop associate in archeology, a member of the Gallery staff since
1922, died on June 16, 1942. From 1923 to 1927, and from 1929 to
1934, Mr. Bishop was in charge of the Freer Gallery field work in
China. He published numerous articles on Chinese archeology in
various journals and was widely known as an authority on the
earlier phases of Chinese culture.

Bureau of American E'thnology.—The time of the members of the
Bureau’s scientific staff has been devoted more and more to activities
concerned with the war effort. Their specialized geographical,
racial, and linguistic knowledge has been in constant demand by the
Army, Navy, and other war agencies, and certain staff members
have cooperated closely with the Ethnogeographic Board, an agency
that acts as a clearinghouse for anthropological, geographical, and
related information needed in the war effort. As time permitted,
the Bureau continued its normal work of studying the American
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 7

Indian. M. W. Stirling, Chief of the Bureau, spent 2 months in
Mexico in continuation of the Smithsonian Institution-National
Geographic Society archeological project in that country. Dr. John
R. Swanton continued work on a study of the language of the
Timucua Indians of Florida and on the revision of a large general
paper on the Indians of North America. Dr. John P. Harrington
carried forward work on two problems involving linguistic studies
of Aleut, the language of the islands between Asia and America, and
of Athapascan, the language of the northern Rockies, of a large
part of the Pacific coast, and of the southern deserts. Dr. Frank H.
H. Roberts, Jr., conducted archeological excavations at a site near
San Jon, N. Mex., uncovering an interesting sequence of projectile
points and other artifact types and obtaining new information on
aboriginal occupation of that area. Just before the close of the
year Dr. Roberts went to Newcastle, Wyo., to inspect a promising
archeological site. Dr. Julian H. Steward continued his work as
editor of the Handbook of South American Indians, in the course
of which he visited Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Chile for con-
ferences with Latin-American anthropologists. Dr. Henry B. Col-
lins, Jr., continued the study of archeological materials from pre-
historic Eskimo village sites around Bering Strait. Dr. W. N. Fen-
ton carried on several investigations relating to the Iroquois Indians.
Dr. Philip Drucker made an analysis of the pottery collections made
in Mexico in 1941 by the Smithsonian Institution-National Geo-
graphic Society expedition. In continuation of the work of this ex-
pedition he went in January 1942 to a site at La Venta, in north-
west Tabasco, where excavations resulted in a number of interesting
discoveries. Miss Frances Densmore, a collaborator of the Bureau,
recorded Omaha songs at Macy, Nebr. The Bureau published its
Annual Report and three Bulletins. The lbrary accessioned 350
items; the reclassification of the library was practically completed
during the year.

International Eachanges—The Exchange Service acts as the
official United States agency for the interchange of parliamentary,
governmental, and scientific publications between this country and
the rest of the world. The Service handled during the year 561,151
packages of publications weighing 326,406 pounds. As would be ex-
pected, the work of the Exchange Service was greatly hampered by
the war. In the Eastern Hemisphere only Great Britain and the
Union of South Africa continued to receive shipments from this
country. In the Western Hemisphere, where all packages are sent
by mail, there was no interruption to the sending of exchanges,
although censorship caused some delay. In April 1942 the sending
of the Congressional Record to foreign countries through the Ex-
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

change Service was discontinued for the duration at the request of
the Office of Censorship.

National Zoological Park.—Although war conditions reduced the
number of out-of-town visitors to the Zoo, more people from nearby
areas came by bus and streetcar and on foot, bringing the total at-
tendance for the year to 2,523,300, or sightly more than the number
for the previous year. A considerable proportion of the attendance
was made up of men in the armed services, many of them enjoying
their first oportunity of visiting a large zoo. As usual, a large num-
ber of gifts of animals came to the Park, and there were 65 mammals
born, 40 birds hatched, and 2 reptiles born during the year. Deaths
included a sulphur-crested cockatoo that had been in the Zoo for 52
years, and the American bald eagle “Jerry,” a Zoo resident for 26
years. The epidemic of psittacosis that caused serious losses of
birds and caused the closing of the bird house to the public for 3
months, as noted in last year’s report, was finally subdued through
the cooperation of the United States Public Health Service and the
District of Columbia Health Department. Many of the poisonous
reptiles have been removed from the Zoo, leaving so few that they
could be quickly disposed of in an emergency. At the close of the
year, the collection contained a total of 2,411 animals, representing
722 different species.

Astrophysical Observatory—The most important event of the
year was the publication of volume 6 of the Annals of the Observa-
tory, which covers its operations from 1920 to 1939. Besides de-
scribing in detail the principal research on the variation of the sun’s
radiation, the volume is the culmination of several years’ work de-
voted to revising the daily results of observation of the solar con-
stant of radiation at the three field observing stations at Montezuma,
Chile, Table Mountain, Calif., and Mount St. Katherine, Egypt,
from 1923 to 1939. The values published clearly indicate the vari-
ation of the sun between extreme ranges up to about 3 percent for
the period covered. The variation is shown to be composed of 14
periodicities ranging from 8 months to 273 months. Each of these
periods is reflected in terrestrial temperature and precipitation as
recorded by official weather services. Another important event was
the incorporation as a branch of the Observatory of the Smithson-
ian Division of Radiation and Organisms, hitherto supported by
private funds. Considerable confidential work for military purposes
was done in the Observatory’s instrument shop under the care of
the Director. Because of the discovery that the percentage varia-
tions of the intensity of sun’s rays is 6 times as great for ultraviolet
rays as for the total of all wave lengths, apparatus was prepared in
the instrument shop for restricting the determinations of solar varia-
tions to the spectral regions of the green, blue, violet, and ultraviolet
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9

rays. This apparatus has been installed at all three field stations.
Also prepared in the instrument shop were three copies of a sky
polarization device invented by the late Prof. E. C. Pickering. It
is believed that the use of this device at the observing stations will
obviate the unsatisfactory results brought about by certain types of
sky conditions. Solar observations on all favorable days have been
continued at the three present field stations at Table Mountain,
Calif., Burro Mountain, N. Mex., and Montezuma, Chile.

Division of Radiation and Organisms.—On July 1, 1941, the Divi-
sion became a branch of the Astrophysical Observatory and received
Congressional appropriation for the support of its researches. Mem-
bers of its staff were given Civil Service status. The present
research work of the Division comes under three headings: Photo-
synthesis, plant growth and radiation, and development of
apparatus and methods. Experiments were continued on the factors
that influence the change in rates of respiration in plants, which led
to speculation on the possibility ot the existence of a carbon dioxide
reservoir connected with the cell mechanism. There is evidence also
that the humidity of the air plays an important role in this gaseous
exchange. The study of the relationship between light intensity and
inhibition of growth of the oats mesocotyl was extended to higher
intensities. Work is in progress on the isolation and separation of
two pigments indicated to occur in dark-grown oat seedlings. Pre-
vious work in the Division had shown that illumination increases the
rate of carbon dioxide production by etiolated barley seedlings. Ap-
paratus was assembled and preliminary experiments were begun to
study the influence of radiation on the respiration of other types of
plants. (Since October 1942 the Division has done war work only.)

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of
England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States
of America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting
the trust, Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and, therefore,
constituted an “establishment” whose statutory members are “the
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of
the executive departments.”

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

Changes in the Board of Regents during the fiscal year included
the election at the Board meeting on January 16, 1942, of Chief
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

Justice Harlan F. Stone as Chancellor of the Institution, to succeed
former Chief Justice Charles E. Hughes, and the appointment by
Joint Resolution of Congress approved August 21, 1941, of the
Honorable Frederic C. Walcott, a citizen of Connecticut, to succeed
the late R. Walton Moore. By Joint Resolution of Congress approved
August 21, 1941, Frederic A. Delano, of the city of Washington, D. C.,
was reappointed to succeed himself for the statutory term of 6 years.

The roll of regents at the close of the fiscal year was as follows:
Harlan F. Stone, Chief Justice of the United States, Chancellor;
Henry A. Wallace, Vice President of the United States; members
from the Senate—Charles L. McNary, Alben W. Barkley, Bennett
Champ Clark;members from the House of Representatives—
Clarence Cannon, William P. Cole, Jr., Foster Stearns; citizen
members—Frederic A. Delano, Washington, D. C.; Roland S. Mor-
ris, Pennsylvania; Harvey N. Davis, New Jersey; Arthur H. Comp-
ton, Illinois; Vannevar Bush, Washington, D. C.; and Frederic C.
Walcott, Connecticut.

Proceedings —The annual meeting of the Board of Regents was
held on January 16, 1942. The regents present were Chief Justice
Harlan F. Stone, Chancellor; Vice President Henry A. Wallace;
Representatives Clarence Cannon, William P. Cole, Jr., and Foster
Stearns; citizen regents Frederic A. Delano, Roland §. Morris, Harvey
N. Davis, Vannevar Bush, and Frederic C. Walcott; and the Secretary,
Dr. Charles G. Abbot.

The Board received and accepted the Secretary’s annual report
covering the year’s activities of the parent Institution and the sev-
eral Government branches. The Board also received and accepted
the report by Mr. Delano, of the executive committee, covering
financial statistics of the Institution; and the annual report of the
Smithsonian Art Commission.

In his special report the Secretary outlined some of the more im-
portant activities carried on by the Institution and the branches

during the year.
FINANCES

utive committee of the Board of Regents, page 99.

MATTERS OF GENERAL INTEREST
SMITHSONIAN RADIO PROGRAM

The educational radio program known as “The World Is Yours,”
sponsored jointly by the Smithsonian Institution, the United States
Office of Education, and the National Broadcasting Co., was ter-
minated with the broadcast of May 10, 1942, after nearly 6 years
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 1

of successful operation. On the air every week almost without a
break for more than 300 weeks, the series finally was brought to
an end because of the urgent demand of war agencies for radio
time. In explaining the necessity for closing the program, Thomas
D. Rishworth, director of public service programs, Eastern Division,
National Broadcasting Co., wrote to the Institution:

I regret that it was necessary to cancel “The World Is Yours” in view of
its long and successful history as one of our oldest educational broadcasts
* * * The war emergency has brought upon radio many difficulties that
were unforseen, not the least of which is the impossibility of expanding a
strictly limited schedule to meet the needs of all agencies involved in the war
effort * * * JI believe everyone will agree that through “The World Is
Yours” you have made a unique contribution to the development of the educa-
tional significance of radio in terms that were interesting to all types of
listeners.

“The World Is Yours,” a half-hour dramatized program, first went
on the air on June 7, 1936, and almost every week since that time it has
presented over a Nation-wide National Broadcasting Company net-
work some phase of science, invention, history, and art. The series from
the beginning struck a responsive chord in radio listeners throughout
the country. Supplementary articles on the subjects discussed were
offered to listeners, and many thousands of those who responded
took occasion to express enthusiastic commendation of the program.
It was made very evident that the American public is keenly inter-
ested in science, history, and related fields if the subjects are brought
alive by dramatization and if excessive technicality is avoided.

Radio proved to be an ideal aid in achieving a principal goal of
the Institution, namely, the diffusion of knowledge. For this rea-
son it was with great regret that “The World Is Yours” was brought
to an end as one of the sacrifices that have to be made when the
country is at war.

The subjects presented during the year up to the close of the series
on May 10 were as follows: 7

WALTER RATHBONE BACON SCHOLARSHIP

The Walter Rathbone Bacon scholarship of the Smithsonian In-
stitution for 1941-1943 was awarded in July 1941 to Philip Hersh-
kovitz, of the University of Michigan, for a study of the distribution
of mammals in Colombia. On November 8, 1941, Mr. Hershkovitz
departed from New York on the steamship Platano and arrived
November 14 at Barranquilla, Colombia, where arrangements for
field work were completed with the assistance of the Department of
State through the Hon. Nelson R. Park, the American consul.
After having obtained the necessary permits for travel and for the
collecting of natural history specimens from the Governor of the
Department of Atlantico, Mr. Hershkovitz was invited by Mr.
Crump, owner of a ranch at Sabana Larga, to set up camp on his
land. Collections were made in the northern portion of the Ciénaga
de Guajaro near Arroya de Piedra and on Cerro de la Guayta from
November 28 to December 18. Returning to Barranquilla, he ex-
amined the Indian burial ground uncovered at the Soledad airport
south of that city, and with the help of P. J. De Guerin, office
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 564

engineer of Avionca, a subsidiary of the Pan-American Airways,
excavated pottery and portions of human skeletons.

After some delay, Mr. Hershkovitz departed on January 3, 1942,
from Barranquilla for Caracolicito, arriving there January 4. On
invitation from the director, Sr. José I. Martinez, Mr. Hershkovitz
made collections in the tropical forests surrounding Colonia Agricola
de Caracolicito from January 9 to March 16. From this region he
moved camp to Pueblo Bello (Pueblo Viejo Sur) on the southern
flank of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, Department of Magda-
lena, and worked there from April 19 to June 6. As a result of cen-
turies of deforesting, overgrazing, and burning by the Indians, the
general appearance of this region is now that of a savanna with
small stands of second-growth timber in the valleys and small patches
of virgin forest on the inaccessible parts of the hills. Consequently,
collecting did not produce as good results as had been anticipated.
About the middle of June, collecting was begun at El Salado, about
halfway between Pueblo Bello and Valencia.

ELEVENTH ARTHUR LECTURE

The late James Arthur, of New York, in 1931 bequeathed to the
Smithsonian Institution a sum of money, part of the income from
which should be used for an annual lecture on the sun.

The eleventh Arthur lecture, under the title “The Sun and the
Earth’s Magnetic Field,” was given by John A. Fleming, director,
department of terrestrial magnetism, Carnegie Institution of Wash-
ington, in the auditorium of the National Museum on February 26,
1942. The lecture is published in full in the General Appendix to this
Report.

The 10 previous Arthur lectures have been as follows:

1. The Composition of the Sun, by Henry Norris Russell, professor of as-
tronomy at Princeton University. January 27, 1932.

2. Gravitation in the Solar System, by Ernest William Brown, professor of
mathematics at Yale University. January 25, 1933.

38. How the Sun Warms the Earth, by Charles G. Abbot, Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution. February 26, 1934.

4. The Sun’s Place among the Stars, by Walter S. Adams, director of the
Mount Wilson Observatory. December 18, 1934.

5. Sun Rays and Plant Life, by Earl S. Johnston, assistant director of the
Division of Radiation and Organisms, Smithsonian Institution. February
25, 1936.

6. Discoveries from Eclipse Expeditions, by Samuel Alfred Mitchell, director

14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

9. Solar Prominences in Motion, by Robert R. McMath, director of the McMath-
Hulbert Observatory of the University of Michigan. January 16, 1940.
10. Biological Effects of Solar Radiation on Higher Animals and Man, by Brian
O’Brien, professor of Physiological Optics, University of Rochester
February 25, 1941.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

Explorations, often in out-of-the-way corners of the earth, have
always formed a major part of the Institution’s program for the
“increase and diffusion of knowledge.” Although world conditions
during the past year have made it either impracticable or undesir-
able to send out many of the expeditions that normally would have
taken the field, nevertheless, even under the present unfavorable con-
ditions it was found possible to carry on some field work in connec-
tion with researches previously commenced.

In astrophysics, the Institution’s field observers carried on their
study of the intensity of solar radiation at the three Smithsonian
observing stations on Mount Montezuma, Chile, Table Mountain,
Calif., and Burro Mountain, N. Mex. Observations were made on
every suitable day throughout the year, and the results were trans-
mitted to Washington where they are used in investigations on the
variability of solar radiation and on the relation between this varia-
bility and the earth’s weather.

In geology, Dr. W. F. Foshag directed an expedition in coopera-
tion with the United States Geological Survey with the purpose of
studying certain strategic-mineral resources of Mexico. Dr. Charles
K. Resser continued his studies of Cambrian rocks from Montana
into the Canadian Rockies, obtaining much new information and
many desirable specimens pertaining to the ancient Cambrian period.
Dr. G. Arthur Cooper made large collections of Carboniferous and
Permian fossils in Texas and Oklahoma, including much material
hitherto lacking in the National Museum collections. A third ex-
pedition to the Bridger Badlands of southwestern Wyoming in
search of extinct vertebrate animals was directed by Dr. C. Lewis
Gazin; many interesting exhibition and study specimens were
brought back to the Museum, including a 1,270-pound slab containing
12 or 13 fossil turtles.

In biology, Dr. E. A. Chapin visited the island of Jamaica to con-
tinue his studies of the insect fauna with special reference to the
termites. Large collections of the plants of Cuba were made by C.
V. Morton, who spent 2 months on the island in botanical field work
accompanied by two Cuban Government botanists.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

In anthropology, Dr. T. D. Stewart visited Peru to make a scien-
tific examination of the skeletal remains exposed in the numerous
ancient cemeteries of that country; he also gathered information on
the skeletal collections in Peruvian museums. As an extension of
Smithsonian cave explorations in the Big Bend region of Texas,
Walter W. Taylor investigated caves in the region of Ciénegas, Co-
ahuila, Mexico, some 20 caves being excavated in the course of the
work. Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., conducted archeological inves-
tigations near the town of San Jon, eastern New Mexico, revealing
four types of projectile points from four stratigraphic horizons, the
oldest type in association with an extinct bison and with indications
that it may be contemporaneous with the Folsom horizon. Dr. Wil-
liam N. Fenton recorded Iroquois songs in New York State and
Canada in cooperation with the Division of Music in the Library of

Congress.
PUBLICATIONS

The publications of the Institution and its branches, issued in several
distinct series, constitute its chief means of accomplishing the “dif-
fusion of knoweldge.” The Smithsonian Annual Report contains,
in addition to the Secretary’s administrative report, a general ap-
pendix made up of selected nontechnical articles which together
constitute a survey of the current state of knowledge in many fields
of scientific investigation. The series Smithsonian Miscellaneous
Collections provides an outlet for the results of researches by Smith-
sonian scientists or collaborators of the Institution without restriction
as to the field covered. The Bulletin and Proceedings of the National
Museum record the investigations of members of its staff, as well as
of outside scientists, based on the great collections of the Museum.
The Bulletins of the Bureau of American Ethnology deal with
various phases of the study of the American Indians. Other series
include the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, the title of
which is self-explanatory, and Smithsonian War Background Studies,
a new series intended to disseminate information on the peoples
and areas involved in the present war.

During the year, 100 publications were issued, 51 by the Institution
proper, 44 by the National Museum, 4 by the Bureau of American
Ethnology, and 1 by the Astrophysical Observatory. The titles,
authors, and other details ot these publications will be found in the
report of the chief of the editorial division, appendix 11. The total
number of publications distributed was 162,525.

Outstanding among the year’s publications may be mentioned
volume 6 of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, covering
20 years’ investigations of the solar radiation; a paper by the late
Carl Whiting Bishop entitled “Origin of the Far Eastern Civiliza-
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

tions: a Brief Handbook”; a paper by Frank C. Hibben on “Eyvi-
dences of Early Occupation in Sandia Cave, New Mexico * * *,”
which throws more light on the earliest occupants of this continent ;
a new edition of the “Handbook of the National Aircraft Collection,”
by Paul E. Garber; and another volume in the series on life histories
of North American birds by Arthur Cleveland Bent, “Life Histories
of North American Flycatchers, Larks, Swallows, and Their Allies.”
The continued demand for the Smithsonian volumes of tables, in
large part from war agencies, necessitated a reprinting of the Smith-
sonian Meteorological Tables and the Smithsonian Physical Tables.

LIBRARY

In common with the scientific libraries of international scope, the
Smithsonian library suffered severe disruption from the impact of
the war. Publication of scientific books and periodicals declined
abroad, and those that were issued were obtainable only with great
difficulty if they could be obtained at all. After Pearl Harbor, of
course, library exchanges ceased with nearly all countries except
those in the Western Hemisphere. The brighter side of the picture,
however, is the service the library has been able to render to war
agency officials, not only by providing access to published informa-
tion, but also by putting inquirers in touch with members of the
Institution’s staff having specialized knowledge and by arranging
introductions to outside sources. Taking advantage of the decreased
amount of time devoted to foreign exchanges, the library staff grasped
the opportunity of recataloging older material that has long needed
attention and of strengthening and extending domestic exchanges.
As usual many gifts came to the library from associations and in-
dividuals, noteworthy among them being 724 publications from the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, 68 from the
American Association of Museums, and a library of some 2,000 items
on Copepoda assembled by the late Dr. Charles Branch Wilson and
presented by his son, Carroll A. Wilson. The most important of
the changes in the library personnel was the retirement on January
31, 1942, of William L. Corbin, librarian for more than 17 years, and
the appointment to succeed him of Mrs, Leila F. Clark, who had been
assistant librarian in charge of the National Museum library since
1929. The year’s statistics show 5,685 accessions, bringing the library’s
total holdings to 867,200; 229 new exchanges arranged; 4,040 “wants”
received ; 4,775 volumes and pamphlets cataloged; 29,826 cards filed
in catalogs and shelflists; 12,258 periodicals entered ; 9,978 books and
periodicals loaned; and 1,400 volumes sent to the bindery.

APPENDIX 1
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the con-
dition and operation of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1942:

Appropriations for the maintenance and operation of the National
Museum for the-year totaled $830,978, which was $12,673 more than
for the previous year.

COLLECTIONS

Additions to the collections of the Museum aggregated 1,388 sepa-
rate accessions, comprising 284,582 individual specimens, a decrease,
compared with the previous year, of 130 accessions and 42,104 speci-
mens. Distribution of these additions among the five departments
was as follows: Anthropology, 3,000; biology, 245,200; geology, 32,-
418; engineering and industries, 2,415; and history, 1,549. These ac-
quisitions were received principally as gifts from individuals, or as
a result of expeditions sponsored by the Smithsonian Institution.
All are listed in detail in the full report on the Museum, published as
a separate document, but the more important are summarized below.
The total number of catalog entries in all departments is now 17,-
578,240.

Anthropology.—The division of archeology received 68 Greek,
Roman, and Egyptian specimens collected by Thomas Nelson Page;
several examples of ancient Persian pottery and armor; about 700
artifacts excavated in Florida; more than 200 stone, bone, pottery,
and shell specimens from the old Indian village site of Potawomeke,
Stafford County, Va.; and 175 artifacts from southern California.
In ethnology, blankets, jewelry, and wearing apparel, representing
the culture of the Navaho of Arizona, the Zuni, the Tule Indians of
the San Blas coast of Panama, the Indians of Guatemala, the Chocé
Indians of Darién, and the Comanche Indians were of outstanding
interest. The ethnological collections were also augmented by
masks, food bowls, head rests, and cult objects from voodoo shrines in
Haiti, and cutting and slashing weapons made by the Moro of Min-
danao, P. I. Among the important accessions to the collection of
ceramics were a glazed Parian pitcher made about 1850 in Vermont;
a Bilston snuffbox made in 1759; an interesting collection of

17
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

eighteenth- and nineteenth-century European ware including pottery,
porcelain, and glass; and examples of Sandwich glass dating to
about 1840.

Biology—The important mammalian accessions of the year in-
cluded 80 Antarctic seals, representing 4 genera and including 3
skins and 3 skeletons of the rare Ross’s seal; 151 mammals from Mo-
have County, Ariz.; 54 Manchurian mammals, one of which was new
to science; a Tibetan fox skin (Cynalopew corsac), a genus hitherto
unrepresented in the Museum, from Yunnan, China; and 35 bats
collected in caves near Washington.

Among the most important and valuable avian accessions of the
year are 1,845 skins collected in Colombia by Dr. Alexander Wet-
more and M. A. Carriker, Jr.; 447 birds from Brazil from the Rocke-
feller Foundation; bird skins from Mexico, Manchuria, Paraguay,
and Alaska. Skins representing forms new to the Museum collection
included 5 from Venezuela, 1 from Chile, and 1 from Ecuador. The
Fish and Wildlife Service of the Department of the Interior trans-
ferred 58 birds from various parts of the world and 8 sets of eggs of
rare North American waterfowl. Of the skeletal material acquired,
63 skeletons were collected by members of the staff, and 90 were re-
ceived from the National Zoological Park.

An outstanding accession of the division of fishes consisted of
14,219 specimens from the area between Peru and Alaska, received by
transfer from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service. Presi-
dent Franklin D. Roosevelt presented a fine “mother of eels,”
Macrozoarces americanus, caught off Novia Scotia on August 9, 1941.
The type material of Hypsoblenniops rickettsi was included in a col-
lection of 107 specimens of fishes from the Gulf of California. New
material, received in exchange, included the following: Holotypes
and paratypes of new species from Liberia and Cameroons; 29 para-
types from Brazil, Yucatan, and Venezuela; a cotype of Hlanura
forficata from Bering Sea; and one paratype each of Sebastodes
owstoni, Nectarges nepenthe, Machaerenchelys vanderbilti, and
Spinoblennius spiniger.

The division of insects received the collection of Hemiptera built
up by Waldo L. McAtee, of the Fish and Wildlife Service, consisting
of approximately 25,000 specimens and containing much type ma-
terial. Mr. McAtee also presented volumes and papers on entomo-
logical subjects needed for the division’s sectional library. The col-
lection of the late George P. Engelhardt and his entomological books
were also acquired by the division—these in addition to the more than
5,000 specimens of Lepidoptera presented by Mr. Engelhardt before
his death. The material collected by the curator, Dr. Edward A.
Chapin, during an expedition in Jamaica, consisting of about 7,600
specimens, mostly termites, was accessioned during the year. A large
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 19

collection, mostly beetles, was received as a gift from the Colombian
Government. Among other large lots of insects received was a col-
lection of 52,000 specimens taken by the United States Bureau of
iuntomology and Plant Quarantine, in connection with its activities.

Accessions to the division of marine invertebrates included 17
species new to the collections, representing crayfish, crabs, stoma-
topods, pyenogonids, ostracods, turbellarian and sipunculid worms,
earthworms, rotifers, sponges, and barnacles. The division’s sec-
tional library received as a bequest from Dr. Charles Branch Wilson
a comprehensive library (approximately 2,500 books and pam-
phlets) on copepods. Among the more important accessions received
by the division of mollusks during the year was a collection made by
Dr. Alexander Wetmore and M. A. Carriker, Jr., in Colombia. ‘This
collection included several new species of mollusks. Two purchases
were made through the Frances Lea Chamberlain fund, consisting of
203 lots of 843 specimens. Several large collections of mollusks were
received, representing the fauna of Fiji, Australia, New Zealand,
Costa Rica, and Hawaii, as well as various localities in the United
States. Many smaller accessions included types of new species. Ad-
ditions to the helminthological collection also contained numerous
types and cotypes. The Museum’s collection of corals was augmented
by 447 specimens, and among the more important accessions of the
division of echinoderms is the first specimen of the brittlestar
Ophiocoma aethiops known from Peru.

Among the more important accessions recorded by the division of
plants (National Herbarium) was a lot of 2,169 specimens received
in continuation of exchange from the Instituto de Ciencias Naturales,
Bogota, Colombia. A ccoperative project between this institution
and the National Museum now in preparation, a descriptive Flora of
Colombia, will include a report on the above-mentioned material.

Geology.—Among the 156 minerals added by purchase to the Roeb-
ling collection was a large, deeply etched aquamarine from Agua
Preta, Minas Geraes, Brazil, the finest single specimen acquired dur-
ing the year. Other accessions included exceptional examples of
copper minerals and lead carbonate, an unusual crystallized turquoise,
a monazite crystal from Brazil, and a mass of the phosphate
lithiophilite. Three acquisitions of exceptionally fine minerals were
obtained by purchase from the collection of Dr. Otto Runge through
the Canfield fund. The most outstanding additions to the gem col-
lection came through a bequest of Mrs. Mary Vaux Walcott, among
which a valuable 12-carat alexandrite, a string of pearls, and 14
necklaces of gem quality are worthy of special mention. ‘The geo-
logical collections were also augmented by several important speci-
mens of meteorites and ores, among them a complete specimen of the
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

Rose City, Mich., stony meteorite, weighing 2,690 grams, one of the
largest individuals of that fall, presented by Dr. Stuart H. Perry,
and a 184-pound mass of cassiterite from Goodwin Gulch, Stewart
Peninsula, Alaska, perhaps the largest ee piece of this ea mineral
ever found.

Outstanding among the accessions by the division of invertebrate
paleontology and paleobotany are a lot of more than 1,500 type speci-
mens of fossil invertebrates; 4 tons of limestone blocks containing
beautifully preserved silicified fossils obtained by Dr. G. A. Cooper
in the Permian formations of the Glass Mountains of Texas; and
8,000 invertebrate fossils obtained by Dr. C. E. Resser from the Cam-
brian and Devonian rocks of Montana, Utah, and the Canadian
Rockies.

Engineering and Industries—Scale models of historic aircraft
formed the largest group of important objects received by the division
of engineering. Among these are models of 10 winners of the Thomp-
son Trophy air races and a model of Sikorsky’s 4-motor biplane,
Grand, of 1913, which is called the first successful 4-motor airplane. A
timely addition to the division’s extensive series of aircraft engines is
an example of the Allison liquid-cooled internal combustion engine,
type V-1710-C, which represents one of industry’s great contributions
to the present war. Another very timely accession is a 14-ton, 4-wheel-
drive reconnaissance and command automobile, or “jeep,” lent by the
War Department. <A transparent, plastic-body 1939 Pontiac automo-
bile, received as a loan, fills the division’s need for a late-model car.

With the consent of interested persons, the material contained in
boxes deposited in the care of the Smithsonian Institution by Alex-
ander Graham Bell in 1880 and 1881 was transferred to the division of
engineering. Included are several photophone transmitters, selenium
cell elements of receivers, an electrotype phonogram, and a grapho-
phone equipped with a reproducing element designed to reproduce
sound through the medium of a jet of air without mechanical contact
with the record.

The most valuable object added to the medical exhibit was the first
Kmerson iron lung, completed in 1931, and used for several years to
produce artificial respiration.

The most noteworthy accession in graphic arts was the gift of 183
Currier and Ives prints previously loaned to the division of graphic
arts by Miss Adele 8. Colgate. This accession was reported and de-
scribed briefly in the report for 1941. With the cooperation of the
Evening Star Newspaper Co. of Washington, the division’s exhibit
showing the steps in the printing of a newspaper was entirely reno-
vated by the substitution of 23 new specimens to replace those now
obsolete.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Zt

History—The art material accessioned by the division of history in-
cludes a water-color sketch, painted in 1918, by Georges Scott, emblem-
atic of the cordial relations existing between France and the United
States. For the numismatic collection the Treasury Department for-
warded a number of California gold tokens, coins, and examples of the
bronze, nickel, and silver coins struck at the Denver, Philadelphia, and
San Francisco mints in 1941. The philatelic material was increased by
1,801 specimens, which were transferred from the Post Office Depart-
ment. Among these are stamps for countries now occupied by Ger-
many, including German stamps overprinted “Luxemburg,” and stamps
issued by Germany for Poland.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

Explorations by members of the Museum staff have produced val-
uable information and highly useful series of specimens in various
fields. The work has been made possible mainly by funds provided
by the Smithsonian Institution, and by interested friends. With
the entry of the United States into the war in December, the pro-
gram of field ‘activities was definitely curtailed. The expeditions
from that date were those already in the field, or those that were
required because of commitments previously made. ‘Though the
scope of the work has been decidedly less than in normal years,
valuable results have been obtained.

Anthropology—Walter W. Taylor, Jr., honorary collaborator in
anthropology, completed archeological explorations around Cuatro
Ciénegas in Coahuila, northern Mexico, which he inaugurated during
the previous fiscal year. He conducted excavations in Fat Burro
Cave and in Nopal Shelter, in Canyon de Jora, about 21 miles west
of Cuatro Ciénegas. He then moved camp to Sierra de San Vicente,
20 miles southeast of Ciénegas, where he excavated a large site called
Frightful Cave, located in the only through canyon in the San Vi-
cente range. In this cave, which measures about 200 feet long and
tapers in width from 30 feet at the entrance to 3 feet at the rear, the
deposits ranged in depth from 10 feet to 3 feet, and consisted of
compact floors, over which were superimposed strata of fire-cracked
stones, ash, and fiber. Noteworthy specimens recovered from Fat
Burro Cave consist of an atlatl, or throwing-stick foreshaft, with an
arrow attached by sinew; a series of split-twig loops, comparable
to those from the Big Bend area in Texas; stone projectile points
similar to those from caves along the Pecos River, Texas; and a few
pieces of split-stitch basketry. From Frightful Cave he recovered
twilled woven bags filled with buckeyes, grooved clubs, four dis-
tinct types of fiber sandals, twined woven mats, and aprons. All
the material collected was packed and transported to Mexico City
for inspection by the scientists of the Instituto Nacional de Anthro-

pologia e Historia, where Mr. Taylor received every courtesy from
the Director of the Institution, Sr. Lic. Alfonso Caso, and the Di-
rector of the Department of Prehispanic Monuments, Sr. Ing. Ig-
nacio Marquina.

From the end of May to the middle of June 1942, Frank M. Setz-
ler, head curator of the department of anthropology, was detailed
to the National Park Service for the purpose of directing a rapid
archeological reconnaissance within the canyons formed by the
Yampa and Green Rivers in northwestern Colorado and eastern
Utah, to locate and evaluate the prehistoric caves, shelters, and vil-
lage sites within an area that may be inundated eventually, if pro-
posed dams are built along these rivers. The expedition traveled by
boat through the various rapids within the canyon, and discovered
and tested numerous sites. A detailed report covering the results
of these investigations was prepared and submitted to the National
Park Service before the close of the fiscal year.

Biology.—In March, M. A. Carriker, Jr., carrying on the work
begun last year with Dr. Wetmore, continued the study and collec-
tion of birds in northeastern Colombia. From Codazzi, in the De-
partment of Magdalena, he traveled into the mountains to establish
a base that gave access to the higher peaks along the Venezuelan
border. These investigations were supplemented by collections from
the lowland areas, which were of value in connection with materials
obtained in March 1941 at Caracolicito, in the drainage of the Rio
Ariguani, At the close of the fiscal year these studies, which were
made possible by the W. L. Abbott fund of the Smithsonian Inst1-
tution, were still in progress.

Dr. Leonard P. Schultz, curator of fishes, was absent from Febru-
ary 1 to May 28 in Venezuela in connection with the program of the
Department of State for promoting cultural relations with other
American countries. Dr. Schultz spent 2 weeks in Caracas, where
he consulted with various scientific groups, and the remainder of
his time in the Maracaibo Basin, studying the fish fauna of that region.
His work there was made possible by the friendly cooperation of the
Lago Petroleum Corporation at Maracaibo and Lagunillas. For §
days Dr. Schultz collected in the valleys of the Rio Motatan, Rio
Chama, Rio Catatumbo, and Rio Torbes, all in the Andes. He ob-
tained about 10,000 fish specimens, including approximately 115
species, and other natural-history material. The fish collection is
the most complete one that has been made in this region and will
afford valuable new information in this field.

Dr. E. A. Chapin, curator of insects, worked for 6 weeks in
Colombia, in connection with the above-mentioned program of the
Department of State. For 5 weeks he was in the vicinity of Bogota,
mainly at the Instituto de Ciencias Naturales in the University
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Za

Center. Through the courtesy of Dr. Armando Dugand, Director of
the Instituto, Dr. Chapin’s researches were conducted with the close
cooperation of Luis M. Murillo, chief entomologist of the Colombian
Government, Francisco Otoya, assistant entomologist, and Hernando
Osorno, preparator. Mr. Murillo conducted several field trips that
permitted Dr. Chapin to become acquainted with some of the major
entomological problems of the country. These included investiga-
tions in the citrus regions near Cachetaé, Pacho, and Guateque, and
two trips into the Paéramo near Guasca. Study in the Bogota area
was accompanied by a tour of other scientific agencies in Colombia.
Dr. Chapin visited the agricultural institute at Medellin, where
work on the collection of insects is under the direction of Dr. F. L.
Gallego. The party, consisting of Messrs. Murillo, Otova, and Cabal
(an entomological student), and Dr. and Mrs. Chapin, then pro-
ceeded to the Agricultural Experiment Station at Palmira. While
they were in Cali Dr. Belisario Losada escorted the party on a col-
lecting trip into the Cordillera. They then returned to Bogota
for a final week of work at the Instituto, where special attention was
given to the family Coccinellidae, which is of considerable economic
importance in Colombia. Pians were formulated for further collab-
oration between the Instituto and the United States National Museum,
with a monographic account of the Coccinellidae of Colombia as
the end in view.

C. V. Morton, assistant curator of plants, spent October and
November in Cuba, under the sponsorship of the National Museum
and the Department of State, for the dual purpose of botanical field
work and the furthering of cooperation with Cuban scientists. Mr.
Morton was occupied part of the time in making partial catalogs of
the ferns in various herbaria. In cooperation with the Cuban De-
partment of Agriculture, and in association with Messrs. Acuna and
Alonzo, of the Estacion Agronémica at Santiago de Las Vegas, he
also undertook field work in the mountainous part of Oriente, espe-
cially on the Sierra Nipe, and the northern slopes of the Sierra
Maestra. Later he made collections in the Trinidad Mountains of
Las Villas, with the Harvard Botanical Garden at Soledad as a
base, and, through the friendly interest of the Colegio de La Salle
of Habana, in the Sierra de Los Organos in Pinar del Rio. These
expeditions resulted in the collection of 6,000 specimens, represent-
ing approximately 1,600 numbers.

Dr. Kk. H. Walker, assistant curator of plants, was occupied for a
week in June in the Piedmont and the Blue Ridge Mountains of
North Carolina and South Carolina, making botanical collections.
Under Dr. Walker’s leadership, local field work has been carried on
by members of the Conference on the District of Columbia Flora.
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

Geology.—Field trips to the West for vertebrate and invertebrate
paleontological collections were specially successful this year.

Dr. C. E. Resser, curator of invertebrate paleontology spent part
of the summer in Montana, and part in the Canadian Rockies. Ac-
companied by George Burke Maxey, of Missoula, Mont., he first made
a brief collecting trip to the northern Wasatch Mountains in search
of Cambrian fossils. In the Canadian Rockies they devoted the first
2 weeks to the study of Cambrian beds in the mountains adjacent to
the Bow Valley, chiefly at Castle Mountain, and in the Valley of the
Ten Peaks at Moraine Lake, where they found excellent fossils high
on nearby Eiffel Peak. They worked for more than a month from
a base camp at the foot of Mount Stephen, 3 miles west of Field,
covering an area as far east as Lake Louise and west beyond Emerald
Lake. For nearly three-quarters of a century the fossil bed on
Mount Stephen has been known to paleontologists throughout the
world. The trail leading up from Field is only 3 miles long, but it
climbs 2,700 feet. Entire trilobites are common, and many other
fossils are obtainable. With the permission of the Canadian Na-
tional Park Service, Dr. Resser and his party collected excellent ma-
terial. Later it was Dr. Resser’s privilege to follow the trail on the
north side of the Kicking Horse River to Burgess Pass, made famous
by Dr. C. D. Walcott, former Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, by his discovery of the most remarkable fauna of these earliest
geological periods yet found.

Dr. G. Arthur Cooper, associate curator of vertebrate paleontology,
collected fossils in Texas and Oklahoma. In Fort Worth he met
Dr. N. D. Newell, and for 3 days, together with Dr. Ralph H. King,
of the Kansas Geological Survey, they collected in north-central
Texas, proceeding from there to Marathon, Tex., where they spent a
month collecting Permian limestone blocks containing silicified fos-
sils. In late July Dr. Cooper met Mrs. J. H. Renfro and her daugh-
ter at Fort Worth for investigations of the Pennsylvanian rocks of
Jack County and the Cretaceous rocks around Fort Worth, where
they obtained many interesting fossils. In August Dr. Cooper col-
lected Devonian and Ordovician fossils at Ardmore, Okla., and then
continued to Ada, Okla., where he was joined by Dr. C. Lalicker, of
the University of Oklahoma, who guided him to numerous localities
where free Pennsylvanian fossils are obtainable. At Muskogee he
made a fine collection of Mississippian fossils, and from there made a
short trip into southern Kansas to collect Pennsylvanian fossils. This
is the third season that Dr. Cooper has collected in these fields, and with
the 4 tons of blocks containing silicified fossils collected in the Glass
Mountains, and many thousand specimens of free Pennsylvanian
fossils obtained this year in north-central Texas and Oklahoma, the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 25

Museum now has an important series of Permian and Pennsylvanian
fossils.

As the field expedition in vertebrate paleontology into the Upper
Cretaceous and Paleocene regions of Utah, under Dr. C. L. Gazin,
associate curator, extended well into the present year, only brief men-
tion was made of it in last year’s report. The party succeeded in ob-
taining some unusually good material of the smaller mammals, the most
outstanding being the lower jaws and fragmentary parts of the skeleton
of the rare Stylinodon, and good specimens of the larger forms such as
Hyrachyus and Paleosyops. Other interesting materials are a large
slab of turtle remains, which will make an interesting exhibition piece,
and a small collection of Paleocene mammals from the Alma forma-
tion in western Wyoming.

Starting early in June 1942, C. W. Gilmore, curator of vertebrate
paleontology, led a party to explore the Oligocene rocks of eastern
Wyoming and western Nebraska, where good progress in the discovery
of mammalian remains has already been reported. Mr. Gilmore had as
assistant the experienced collector George H. Sternberg, and was ac-
companied also by Alfonso Segura Paguaga, of the Museo Nacional,
San José, Costa Rica. The account of operations will be carried in
next year’s report.

In continuation of former field work in Mexico, Dr. W. F. Foshag,
curator of mineralogy and petrology, returned to that country in Feb-
ruary, under a cooperative arrangement with the United Siates Ge-
ological Survey and with the Board of Economic Warfare, to direct
further strategic-mineral work. At the end of the fiscal year he was
still in the field.

From March 17 until May 15, 1942, Dr. Remington Kellogg, curator
of mammals, with Watson M. Perrygo, scientific aid, as assistant, was
engaged in excavating Rampart Cave, in the lower cliff-forming mem-
ber of the Middle Cambrian Peasley limestone, on the south side of the
lower end of the Colorado River canyon, in the Boulder Dam National
Recreational Area, Ariz. This was a cooperative project, undertaken
by the Smithsonian Institution and the National Park Service. The
latter agency detailed Edward T. Schenk, senior geological foreman,
Samuel D. Hendricks, assistant engineer, Dr. Gordon C. Baldwin,
archeologist, Ray Poyser, boat pilot, and seven men from the Boulder
City Civilian Conservation Corps camp for intervals of varying length
to assist in the work. The party obtained skeletal remains of ground
sloths, mountain goats, pumas, marmots, skunks, and several species
of birds, lizards, and snakes. Part of the cave was left undisturbed
as a display for visitors, if it should seem desirable to develop it for
that purpose at some time in the future.

MISCELLANEOUS

Visitors.—Curtailment of travel because of the war had less effect
than anticipated upon the number of visitors at the various Museum
buildings. The total recorded during the year was 2,042,817, as against
2,505,817 for the previous year. The largest attendance for a single
month was in August 1941, with 381,952 visitors, and the second largest
was in July 1941, with 329,927. The attendance in the four Smith-
sonian and Museum buildings was as follows: Smithsonian Building,
375,630; Arts and Industries Building, 936,625; Natural History
Building, 622,989; Aircraft Building (closed from July to November
6), 107,573.

Publications and printing —The sum of $34,750 was available during
the fiscal year 1942 for the publication of the Annual Report, Bulletins,
and Proceedings. Forty-four publications were issued—the Annual
Report, 3 Bulletins, 1 part each of Bulletins 50, 82, and 161, 1 separate
paper from volume 28 of the Contributions from the United States
National Herbarium, and 36 separate Proceedings papers. Titles and
authors of these publications will be found in the report on publica-
tions, appendix 11.

Volumes and separates distributed during the year to libraries, in-
stitutions, and individuals throughout the world aggregated 82,545
copies.

Special exhibits—F ifteen special exhibits were held during the year
under the auspices of various educational, scientific, recreational, and
governmental groups. In addition the department of engineering
and industries arranged 21 special displays—10 in graphic arts and 11
in photography.

Sir: I have the honor to submit, on behalf of the Board of Trus-
tees of the National Gallery of Art, the fifth annual report of the
Board covering its operations for the fiscal year ended June 20,
1942, This report is being made pursuant to the provisions of the act
of March 24, 1937 (50 Stat. 51), as amended by the public resolu-
tion of April 13, 1989 (Pub. Res. No. 9, 76th Cong.).

ORGANIZATION AND STAFF

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1942, the Board was com-
prised of the Chief Justice of the United States, Harlan F’. Stone,
who succeeded the Honorable Charles Evans Hughes as Chief Jus-
tice and took office on July 3, 1941; the Secretary of State, Cordell
Hull; the Secretary of the Treasury, Henry Morgenthau, Jr.; and
the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Dr. C. G. Abbot, ex
officio; and five general trustees, David K. E. Bruce, Duncan Phil-
lips, Ferdinand Lammot Belin, Joseph E. Widener, and Samuel H.
Kress.

At its annual meeting held February 9, 1942, the Board reelected
David K. E. Bruce, President, and Ferdinand Lammot Belin, Vice
President of the Board, to serve the ensuing year. The executive
officers continuing in office during the year were Donald D. Shepard,
Secretary-Treasurer and General Counsel; David E. Finley, Direc-
tor; Harry A. McBride, Administrator; John Walker, Chief Cura-
tor; and Macgill James, Assistant Director. At the annual meeting
the Board elected Chester Dale of New York as an honorary officer
of the Gallery, giving him the title of Associate Vice President. At
a. meeting of the Board held December 29, 1941, the Board provided
for the appointment of Otto R. Eggers and Daniel P. Higgins, con-
stituting the firm of Eggers & Higgins of New York, as consultant
architects for the National Gallery of Art. During the year, George
T. Heckert was appointed Assistant Administrator, such appoint-
ment being made possible because of the reclassification of his office
by the Civil Service Commission.

Also at the annual meeting the Board, pursuant to its bylaws, con-
stituted its three standing committees as follows:

ATTENDANCE

The total attendance for the first year during which the National
Gallery was open was 2,005,328, a daily average of over 5,500 visitors.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9]

A unique record for museum attendance was established on July 7,
1941, when the one millionth visitor entered the Gallery, less than 4
months after its dedication. The Gallery is open to the public each
week day of the year between the hours of 10 a.m. and 5 p. m., except
for Christmas and New Year’s Day, and on Sundays from 2 until
5 p.m.

On June 7, 1942, the Gallery inaugurated an experimental series
of Sunday evening openings, primarily for the benefit of men in the
armed forces and war workers in the city. The exhibition galleries
were open from 2 to 10 p, m., and orchestral concerts during the
summer months were given, through the generosity of Chester Dale,
from 7:15 to closing time. Special lectures with color slides were
given by the Gallery staff at 7:30 and 8:30 in the lecture hall, and
the cafeteria in the Gallery building was open from 4 to 8. Each
Sunday evening from 50 to 75 service men were invited by members
of the staff and by friends of the Gallery to supper in the cafeteria.
On Sundays the attendance frequently exceeded 8,000; and, in view
of the popularity of the Sunday evening openings, it was decided
to continue the arrangement indefinitely.

Through the generosity of Mrs. Matthew John Whittall, the Gal-
lery presented in the lecture hall on the ground floor, a concert by
the Budapest String Quartet on Sunday afternoon, May 381, 1942.
This concert had been planned for men in the Service and their
friends, the program lasting approximately 1 hour.

PUBLICATIONS

In the information rooms in the Gallery building, a general in-
formation booklet is given without charge to visitors on request. It
contains a short survey of the collections and information which has
been found to be of great assistance to visitors to the Gallery. Also
available, are catalogs of the paintings and sculpture, a complete book
of illustrations of all the works of art in the Gallery’s collection, color
reproductions, and postcards in color and black and white, all made
available through the Publications Fund. These publications are on
sale at moderate cost.

AIR-RAID PROTECTION

Immediately following the outbreak of hostilities on December 7,
1941, the National Gallery building was blacked out nightly. The
staff was organized into five air-raid services: Fire, police (includ-
ing morale), health (first aid), maintenance, and evacuation. Drills
were started and repeated frequently in order that the units might
operate smoothly in the event of an actual air raid. Drills that were
held in coordination with the District of Columbia authorities, when
visitors were in the building, evidenced the measure of efficiency

m3
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

which had been reached by the protective organization in the Gallery.
Purchases of air-raid protection equipment were also made as
promptly as possible and to the extent permitted by the great de-
mand for such equipment.

REMOVAL OF WORKS OF ART TO A PLACE OF SAFEKEEPING

At a special meeting held December 29, 1941, the Board approved
the recommendations of the executive officers of the Gallery that a
limited number of the most fragile and irreplaceable works of art
in the national collection be removed to a place of greater safety, in
view of the responsibility which rests with the Trustees for safe-
guarding the collection. Early in January, therefore, the paintings
and sculpture to be evacuated were removed from exhibition and
shipped under guard to the place of safety which had-been deter-
mined upon and adapted for the purpose. All of the works of art
arrived in excellent condition. While thus in storage, they are under
constant guard by members of the National Gallery guard force and
under supervision and inspection by a member of the curatorial staff
of the Gallery.

Beyond this partial evacuation, however, it was the expressed be-
lief of the Trustees that the Gallery has a duty to the public (as a
unit of the Government establishment), and an obligation as a source
of recreation and education to continue its activities, and even in-
crease them, as far as practicable, in wartime.

ACQUISITIONS
GIFTS OF PRINTS

On February 9, 1942, the Board of Trustees accepted from Philip
Hofer a woodcut, “Saint Sebastian,” by Hans Baldung (Grien), to
be added to his earlier gift of prints which was included in last
year’s Annual Report; and again on April 27, 1942, the Board ac-
cepted a gift of 58 prints from Miss Elisabeth Achelis.

Portrait of Sir Robert Graham
The paintings have been received and are now on exhibition.

On April 27, 1942, the Board accepted from Mrs. John W. Simpson
the gift of a group of paintings, drawings, and sculpture. Included
in the gift are two paintings, one entitled “Soap Bubbles,” by Jean-
Baptiste-Simeon Chardin, and the other, “The Binning Children,”
by Sir Henry Raeburn, the latter presented in memory of the late
John Woodruff Simpson. The 11 drawings and 18 pieces of sculpture
by Auguste Rodin constitute a unique collection acquired by the
donor some 40 years ago directly from the artist. The Clodion terra-
cotta plaque also served as a model for the decoration of one of the
monumental urns by Clodion now in the Gallery.

An exhibition, entitled “The Great Fire of London, 1940,” cf 107
paintings and drawings of wartime London by artists serving in
the London Auxiliary Fire Service, was shown in the Gallery from
July 18 through August 10, 1941. Sponsored by the British Govern-
ment under the auspices of the British Library of Information, this
exhibition—selected by Sir Kenneth Clark, Director of the National
Gallery, London; Sir Walter W. Russell, R. A., Keeper of the Royal
Academy; and J. B. Mason, former Curator of the Tate Gallery,
London—after the completion of its first showing in the United States
at the National Gallery, toured the United States and Canada.

Seventy paintings and drawings, and sculpture, representing the
art of Australia from 1788 to 1941, were placed on exhibition at the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY oo

Gallery from October 2 to 26, 1941. These works of art, the first
comprehensive exhibition of Australian art to be shown in the United
States, were sent, under the auspices of the Carnegie Corporation
of New York, by the Commonwealth of Australia.

Architectural drawings of the National Gallery building, to-
gether with progress photographs and a model of the exterior of the
building, showing the development of the building from the first
sketch to the final drawings, were loaned by Eggers & Higgins, the
architects, for exhibition at the Gallery from December 18, 1941, to
January 28, 1942. The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable
Trust, to augment the exhibition, loaned a number of renderings and
photographs of the progress of the building from their own records.

Two groups of American water colors, drawings and prints—
“American Artists’ Record of War and Defense” and “Soldiers of
Production”—were shown at the National Gallery; the former from
February 7 to March 8, 1941, and the latter from March 17 to April
15, 1942. The water colors in the first group had been submitted
in national competition for pictures recording war and defense activ-
ities, conducted by the Section of Fine Arts for the Office for
Emergency Management, and most of them were purchased by the
United States Government after selection by the appointed jury.
Those in the second group were water colors and drawings by eight
artists appointed on recommendation of the Section of Fine Arts by
the Office for Emergency Management and who, through the courtesy
of the War and Navy Departments, were permitted to make drawings
and paintings of what is known as restricted material.

The Citizens Committee for the Army and Navy, Inc., exhibited
at the Gallery for a period of approximately 2 weeks, beginning
April 8, 1942, three triptychs by contemporary artists, which had
been selected by the Committee for later presentation to the Chapel
at Arlington Cemetery, Va.

An exhibition of paintings, posters, water colors, and prints, show-
ing activities of the American Red Cross, were exhibited from May 2
to 30, 1942. These paintings were submitted in a national competi-
tion conducted for the American Red Cross by the Section of Fine
Arts, Public Buildings Administration, Federal Works Agency. The
exhibition included the paintings which were purchased for the Red
Cross on advice of a jury, together with a group of other pictures
also recommended by the jury for exhibition.

An exhibition of 11 portrait busts of the Presidents of the Repub-
lics of South America, by the American sculptor, Jo Davidson, was
held in the west garden court at the National Gallery of Art, begin-
ning Saturday afternoon, June 27, and continuing for about a
month. These busts were commissioned by the Office of the Co-

501591—43——4
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

ordinator of Inter-American Affairs and will be presented to the
Governments of the South American Republics by the Department
of State of the United States of America. Portrait busts in bronze,
also by Jo Davidson, of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt and
Vice President Henry A. Wallace, were shown at this time.

CURATORIAL DEPARTMENT

The curatorial work for the year consisted in the rearrangement
of the permanent collection necessitated by additional gifts and by
various precautions that were required by the outbreak of the war;
in the installation of 17 temporary exhibitions; in various lectures
on the collection and related fields in conjunction with the work of
the educational department; and in further cataloging of the paint-
ines and sculpture. During the year the preliminary Catalog of
the Permanent Collection and the Book of Illustrations were brought
up to date and reprinted; two catalogs containing a historical sur-
vey, notes, and bibliography of the French paintings loaned from
the Chester Dale collection were compiled, and a new general in-
formation pamphlet was prepared.

In the course of the year, 209 works of art were submitted to the
acquisitions committee with written recommendations regarding
their acceptability for the collection of the National Gallery of Art;
40 private collections were visited in Washington and other cities
in connection with offers to the Gallery of gifts or loans; 152 works
of art were brought to the Gallery and submitted to the staff for
expert opinion; and 44 letters were written in answer to inquiries
involving research in the history of art.

RESTORATION AND REPAIR OF WORKS OF ART

During the year, as authorized by the Board and with the approval
of the Director and Chief Curator, Stephen Pichetto, consultant re-
storer to the Gallery, has undertaken such restoration and repair of
paintings and sculpture in the collection as has been found to be
necessary. All of this work was carried on in the restorer’s rooms
in the Gallery except in three cases, once when unusually delicate
and complicated restoration was required, and twice when the pic-
tures had to be relined to prevent damage in shipment from New
York. These three paintings were restored in Mr. Pichetto’s studios
in New York.

EDUCATIONAL PROGRAM

As indicated in the following summary, public response to the
program of educational activities of the Gallery has constantly in-
creased month by month until the total attendance recorded for
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY ot

June, 1942 (6,884), more than doubled that recorded for July, 1941
(2,882).

A basic part of the Gallery’s educational program has been the
gallery tours of the collection, conducted twice daily, except on
Saturday and Sunday, which have attracted 18,935 visitors. In ad-
dition to these tours there has been a series of special lectures: a
special program of 34 lectures, beginning in October and contin-
uing through April, presented a special lecture each Saturday aiter-
noon in the lecture hall, which 7,292 persons attended, and the in-
timate “gallery talks” and other lectures presented in the auditorium,
dealing with a specific school or works of art, attracted a combined
total of 17,752.

The educational department feeling the need for a short noontime
feature, in view of the increased number of visitors from nearby
Government buildings during this time, inaugurated on January 2,
1942, the “Picture of the Week,” a 15-minute talk given twice each
day and once on Sunday, which in turn attracted 7,947 people, in-
dicating that this educational feature of the program was one of
the most popular.

In addition, members of the educational department staff have
conducted private and group conferences, totaling 3,065 individuals,
of which 700 were members of the armed forces for whom special
tours were arranged on Saturday afternoon, beginning in December
1941.

LIBRARY

A total of 242 books and 1,087 pamphlets and pericdicals were
presented to the Gallery; 962 bocks and catalogs were acquired
through exchange; 37 books and catalogs were purchased; and 20
books were received on indefinite loan.

PHOTOGRAPHIC DEPARTMENT

Prints totaling 6,094, 1,187 black and white slides, and 709 color
slides have been made by the photographic laboratory. The prints
have been placed on file in the Library where they are for sale and
for the use of the Gallery staff. The slides, together with an addi-
tional 420 which were purchased during the year, have been made
available for the staff in connection with the public lectures given at
the Gallery, and have likewise been lent to lecturers outside the
National Gallery and to other galleries.

THE GALLERY: BUILDING

During the fiscal year, certain alterations and improvements have
been made in the building upon the recommendation of the com-
mittee on the building, among which may be mentioned the construc-
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

tion of snow steps for the Mall entrance, the redecoration of gallery
rooms for the exhibition of the Chester Dale collection, and addi-
tional air conditioning in the smoking room and the information
rooms on the main and ground floors. The National Gallery Cafeteria
has become so popular that it is somewhat congested during certain
hours of the day. It became evident that some acoustical treatment
of the ceiling should be undertaken, and this work, resulting in
great improvement in the noise condition in the cafeteria, was com-
pleted with funds supplied by The A. W. Mellon Educational and
Charitable Trust. It was also recommended that a revolving door
be installed to replace one of the heavy bronze doors at the Constitu-
tion Avenue entrance. Although funds were made available it was
not possible to proceed with this improvement because the materials
required were restricted by priority rulings,

OTHER GIFTS

During the year there were gifts to the Gallery of furnishings,
equipment, ornamental trees and plants, prints, films, and color
slides; also certain expenses were paid by others on behalf of the
Gallery, the donors being David K. E. Bruce, Frederick T. Bon-
ham, William R. Coe, David E. Finley, Samuel H. Kress, Donald
D. Shepard, Percy S. Strauss, Mr. and Mrs. J. L. McGrew, Mrs.
Matthew John Whittall, Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs,
Propagating Gardens of the Department of the Interior, American
Red Cross, and The A. W. Mellon Educational and Charitable
Trust. Gifts of moneys were made to the Gallery during the year
by Paul Mellon, Chester Dale, Howard J. Heinz, Jr., and The A. W.
Mellon Educational and Charitable Trust.

AUDIT OF PRIVATE FUNDS OF THE GALLERY

An audit has been made of the private funds of the Gallery for
the year ended June 30, 1942, by Price, Waterhouse & Co., a nation- —
ally known firm of public accountants, and the certificate of that
company on its examination of the accounting records maintained
for such funds has been submitted to the Gallery.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT OF THE NATIONAL COLLECTION
OF FINE ARTS

sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the ac-
tivities of the National Collection of Fine Arts for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1942:

After Pearl Harbor plans were made for the protection of the
works of art in the National Collection of Fine Arts. The center
portion of the wall behind the large painting “Diana of the Tides,”
by John Elliott, was strengthened sufficiently to resist bomb frag-
ments. Protection against damage from incendiary bombs has been
provided, but means have not yet been devised to prevent such
bombs from reaching the ground floors where the exhibits are shown.
Plans for packing and shipping paintings for evacuation have been
made, and the miniatures and part of the Gellatly collection are to
be moved to the ground-floor lobby, where they would be protected
against incendiary bombs.

Several proffered gifts of paintings, furniture, miniatures, and
vases have been deposited here to be passed upon by the Smithsonian
Art Commission in December 1942.

Eight special exhibitions were held in the foyer, including three
under the sponsorship of the Pan American Union and the Ministers
of the various countries, involving the installation of 428 specimens.
Nine special Graphic Arts exhibits were shown in the lobby.

From July 10 to 27, 1941, the Acting Director visited galleries and
private collections between Washington and Boston for the purpose
of studying various collections of American miniatures.

An illustrated lecture on the National Collection of Fine Arts was
given by the Acting Director before the Chevy Chase Women’s Club
on November 11, 1941.

A painting, “The First Reading of the Emancipation Procla-
mation,” by Francis B. Carpenter, 9 feet x 14 feet 6 inches, was
cleaned and restored at the United States Capitol.

APPROPRIATIONS

For the administration of the National Collection of Fine Arts
by the Smithsonian Institution, including compensation of necessary
employees, purchase of books of reference and periodicals, traveling

39
AQ ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

expenses, uniforms for guards, and necessary incidental expenses,
$29,880.14 was appropriated, of which over $18,000 was expended
for the care and maintenance of the Freer Gallery of Art, a unit
of the National Collection of Fine Arts. ‘The balance was spent for
the care and upkeep of the National Collection of Fine Arts, nearly
all of this sum being required for the payment of salaries, traveling
expenses, purchase of books and periodicals, and necessary disburse-
ments for the care of the collection.

LECTURES AND DOCENT SERVICE

One lecture by a staff member was given to a woman’s club organiza-
tion (20 members) ; 5 groups (total 81 persons) were given instruction
in the study room; 1 group (20 persons) was given docent service in
storage rooms, and 9 groups (total 190 persons) were given docent serv-
ice in the exhibition galleries. The total number of persons receiving
such services, by request, was 311.

A series of lectures upon air-raid precautions, addressed to Smith-
sonian and Freer Gallery employees, was given in the auditorium by
Kenneth M. Perry of the United States National Museum, June 9, 11,
and 13, 1942; total attendance, 97.

PERSONNEL

Grace T. Whitney worked intermittently at the Gallery from No-
vember 8, 1941, to June 22, 1942, on the translation of Persian texts.

On March 7, 1942, Mar caret B. Arnold resigned as assistant after 2
years of service.

Miss M. Eleanor Morsell was appointed to succeed Miss Arnold on
May 1, 1942.

On June 16, after a month’s serious illness, occurred the death of
Carl Whiting Bishop, associate in archeology. Mr. Bishop became
a member of the Gallery staff April 10, 1922, to work in his chosen
field of Far Eastern archeology. From 1923 to 1927, and again from
48 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

1929 to 1984, Mr. Bishop was in charge of the Freer Gallery field
work in China, making reconnaissance studies at neolithic stations
in Shansi Province as well as general surveys of burial sites of the
historic period. He published numerous articles upon these subjects
in various journals, being widely known as an authority on the earlier
phases of Chinese culture. His death, at 61, is a matter of deep regret
to his colleagues.

APPENDIX 5
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of American
Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1942, conducted in
accordance with the act of Congress of April 5, 1941, which provides
“#* * * for continuing ethnological researches among the American
Indians and the natives of Hawaii and the excavation and preservation
of archeologic remains. * * *”

During the fiscal year, the energies of the Bureau have been diverted
to an increasing extent to activities concerned with the war effort. In
particular, members of the Bureau staff have cooperated with the
Ethnogeographic Board, and it is expected that diversion of effort in
this direction will increase as the war continues. Activities concerned
with Latin America have likewise been emphasized.

SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

M. W. Stirling, Chief of the Bureau, left Washington for Mexico
early in April 1942 in continuation of the program of work for the
Smithsonian Institution-National Geographic Society archeological
project in southern Mexico. A visit of 2 weeks was made to the site
of La Venta in Tabasco, where Dr. Philip Drucker was conducting
excavations on the same project. From La Venta, Mr. Stirling went
to Tuxtla Gutierrez in Chiapas in order to attend the archeological
conference held under the sponsorship of the Sociedad Mexicana de
Antropologia. While in Chiapas opportunity was taken to visit vil-
lages of the Zoque, Tzotzil, and Chamula Indians. A trip was also
made to the ancient Maya ruins of Palenque, where a week was spent
at the site. Mr. Stirling returned to Washington early in June.

The remainder of the year was spent in Washington administering
the affiairs of the Bureau and in the preparation of reports dealing
with the work in Mexico.

Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, devoted the greater part of the
fiscal year to digesting and carding the extant materials in the lan-
guage of the Timucua Indians of Florida, a language which passed out
of existence early in the eighteenth century. He also devoted some
time to the revision of a large general paper on the Indians of North

49
a0) ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

America. This manuscript has not been submitted for publication as,
owing to its size, there is little likelihood of its being printed in the near
future. A brief paper was prepared on The Evolution of Nations,
and this was published in the series of War Background Studies of
the Smithsonian Institution.

Dr. Swanton has also continued to serve as the representative of
the Institution on the United States Board of Geographical Names.

Dr. John P. Harrington, ethnologist, conducted field work during
the year on two problems involving linguistic studies of Aleut, the
language of the islands between Asia and America, and of Athapascan,
the language of the northern Rockies, of a large part of the Pacific
coast, and of the southern deserts. He left Washington in August
1941 to visit the Aleutian Islands, where he was fortunate enough to
secure the services of Ivan Yatchmeneff, son of the Unalaska chief.
The Aleuts consist of three divisions, popularly known as Unalas-
kans, Atkans, and Attuans, but all of them are under the Unalaska
chief. Working on St. Paul Island, famous as the breeding place of
the fur seal, and elsewhere, he made a complete study of the sounds
and grammar of the language, with the result that it proved to be a
penetrant from the American side, a typically American language of
sastern origin, Which has penetrated westward never quite to cross the
Aleutian Chain. The Unalaska dialect is related to and undoubtedly
derived from the language of the Alaska peninsula. The fact that the
Chain was occupied by an American language is important because
of its possible fundamental relationship to the Athapascan stock of
inland Alaska.

A byproduct of the field studies was the obtaining of a probable
etymology of the name “Aleut” which differs from those previously
offered by other investigators. The name is still pronounced with
three syllables in Russian, as Al-e-ut, and is the same as the tribal
name “Aglimyut,” in modern usage applied to a Bristol Bay tribe.
The name of the high hill on St. George Island also omits the interior
m, just as it is omitted in the word “Aleut.” Early Russian usage
took over the name with inclusive application, which later became
crystallized into application to speakers of the Aleut language alone,
although the Kodiak Islanders are still spoken of in Russian and
Aleut as the Kodiak Aleuts, even at the present day.

Following the Aleutian work, Dr. Harrington proceeded to British
Columbia, where he undertook studies of the relationship of Navaho
and Apache with the Athapascan stock of the northernmost Rocky
Mountains. This relationship was first reported by Horatio Haie
and by William Turner. In British Columbia Dr. Harrington recov-
ered traditions that the Chilcotin language had formerly occupied
the Nicola Valley, and was able to obtain a large number of Chilcotin
words in that region, handed down in individual families. Following
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 51

this lead, he was able to discover individuals who had in their remote
youth actually spoken the extinct Kwalhioqua and Tlatskanai dialects
of Washington and Oregon, and to recover vocabularies of these with
all their original phonetics. He also recorded the tradition that the
Upper Umpqua language of what is now the vicinity of Roseburg,
Oreg., had come from the Kwalhioqua. The Roseburg language is
related to the languages of the Rogue River region of southern Oregon
and those of northern California. In confirmation of these findings,
he obtained the tradition that the Blue Lake Indians had come from
the south bend of the Smith River, far to the north. Dr. Harrington
has traced the Chilcotin or Chilco language all the way from Lake
Chilcotin, which drains into the Fraser River, to the head of Kel River
in northern California. This work has demonstrated that the Eel
River language is merely a Chilco dialect which has drifted south.
The exact provenience of these southern tongues is Dr. Harrington’s
present goal.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr.,
was engaged in archeological excavations at a site on the north rim
of the Staked Plains, 1014 miles south of the town of San Jon,
N. Mex. These investigations were continued until September 6.
The work produced evidence for an interesting sequence of projectile
points and other artifact types and new information on some phases
of the aboriginal occupation of that portion of the Southwest. The
oldest archeological material present was found to be in association
with bones from an extinct species of bison and in the same stratum
as mammoth remains. Indications are that, although from a dif-
ferent complex, this material probably dates from about the end of
the Folsom horizon some 10,000 to 15,000 years ago. Between this
level and the next in the series there was a gap of an, as yet, un-
determined although appreciable length of time. During this inter-
val the large bison were replaced by a smaller species, the modern
buffalo. From the start of the second stage down to protohistoric
times there was no break in the occupation of the area investigated,
and the points and artifacts were found to progress from forms
similar to those found in the Texas area to the east to those com-
monly associated with late sites in many parts of the country. The
specimens from the second level belong to the so-called Yuma cate-
gory, and the evidence from San Jon indicates that chronologically
they are much later than hitherto supposed. The artifacts from the
late horizon show that several different Indian groups used that
area as hunting territory. In the light of present knowledge, how-
ever, it is not possible to identify the specific groups from the arti-
fact types.

52 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

In keeping with the Smithsonian Institution’s policy of coopera-
tion with and aid to other institutions, Dr. Roberts took leave from
July 28 to August 9 to give a series of lectures on Southwestern
archeology and to direct student excavations at the University of
New Mexico Field Session in the Chaco Canyon, N. Mex. During
his absence, the work at San Jon was continued under the supervision
of Eugene C. Worman, Jr., of the department of anthropology,
Harvard University. From the Chaco Canyon, Dr. Roberts re-
turned to San Jon, and, upon completion of the work there, returned
to Washington.

The fall and winter months were spent in regular office routine;
in the preparation of a manuscript entitled “Archeological and
Geological Investigations in the San Jon District, Eastern New
Mexico” for publication in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collec-
tions; in library researches for information for and sponsoring
programs on Carthage, Zebulon M. Pike, and Babylon for “The
World Is Yours” broadcasts; in organizing air-raid protection groups
for the Smithsonian building and serving as building warden under
the Public Buildings Administration Civilian Defense program; and
in assisting in the preparation of material for evacuation to storage
places outside of Washington.

On June 27 Dr. Roberts left Washington for Newcastle, Wyo., to
inspect a site on the Cheyenne River where animal bones and arti-
facts were reported to be eroding from a gully bank and possible
valuable information was in danger of being lost through the action
of natural agencies. This investigation was just starting at the close
of the fiscal year.

Dr. Julian H. Steward, anthropologist, continued his activities as
editor of the Handbook of South American Indians. On September
9, 1941, Dr. A. Métraux was appointed to assist Dr. Steward in the
preparation of the Handbook.

At the end of the fiscal year, completed manuscripts totaling about
600,000 words had been received from approximately 90 contributors.
Half of the contributions are from Latin American scientists, while
the remainder are from North American specialists on Middle and
South American Indian tribes. The very important tribal map
covering a large portion of South America was completed for the
Handbook by Curt Nimuendaju and is now in Dr. Steward’s hands.
A collection of photographs of South American Indians was begun,
and between 4,000 and 5,000 bibliographic items had been assembled.

From February to May 1942, Dr. Steward visited Brazil, Argen-
tina, Paraguay, and Chile, where he conferred with Latin American
anthropologists and arranged for their cooperation in matters per-
taining to the Handbook. He also discussed plans for the formation
of an “inter-American anthropological and geographic society,” for
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 53

the development of cooperative anthropological and geographic re-
search, and for the expansion of the exchange of publications.
During this visit, Dr. Steward was made an honorary member of
Academia Guarani of Paraguay and Sociedad de Antropologia de
Argentina.

Dr. Steward has also served during the year as a member of the
Policy Board of the American Indian Institute, the Advisory Board
Strategic Index, and Publications Subcommittee of the Joint Com-
mittee on Latin American Studies.

During the past fiscal year, Dr. Henry B. Collins, Jr., ethnologist,
continued with the study of archeological materials from prehistoric
Eskimo village sites around Bering Strait. In April he presented
a paper at the annual meeting of the American Philosophical Society,
at Philadelphia, in which he discussed the relationships between pre-
historic Eskimo culture and recently described Neolithic remains from
the Lake Baikal region, southern Siberia, which have been regarded
as the source of the basic American Indian culture. The paper,
which is to be published in somewhat expanded form in the Proceed-
ings of the Society, points out a number of close resemblances between
the oldest Eskimo cultures—which probably date from around the
beginning of the Christian era—and the Siberian Neolithic. The
older stages of culture elsewhere in America, such as Folsom and
Sandia, exhibit no such resemblances; it seems unlikely, therefore,
that the Siberian Neolithic was the reservoir from which American
culture in general was derived.

In the latter part of the fiscal year, Dr. Collins devoted considerable
time to work in connection with the war effort, including the prepara-
tion of illustrated reports on various strategic areas. Preparation
was also begun on a general paper on Alaska for the Smithsonian
War Background Studies.

Dr. William N. Fenton, associate anthropologist, devoted the
summer months of 1941 to the preparation of an introduction to his
materials on Iroquois medical botany. Since a surprising number of
Indian herbs have been taken into our pharmacopoeia, it was decided
to publish the section on Contacts between Iroquois Herbalism and
Colonial Medicine, a unit of itself, as an article in the appendix to
the Annual Report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1941, reserving
the balance of the study for a longer monograph.

In November, Dr. Fenton went to Brantford, Ontario, to work with
Simeon Gibson of Six Nations Reserve at translating Onondaga texts
bearing on the Iroquois League which his father, Chief John A. Gibson,
had dictated to the late J. N. B. Hewitt. Of these the principal manu-
script is a 189-page version in Onondaga of the “Deganawi’dah” legend
of the founding of the Iroquois confederacy. Some 13 years later,
Chief Gibson dictated a longer version of the same legend to Dr. Alex-
54 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

ander Goldenweiser, and this manuscript was turned over to Dr. Fen-
ton some years ago by its collector. A translation of the Hewitt
manuscript was completed in the field, and this has been reworked in
part during the winter. Plans were made to translate the Golden-
Weiser manuscript during the ensuing year.

Two other research projects continued through the year. New mate-
rials were discovered by Dr. Fenton’s collaborators in a study of Corn-
planter’s Senecas on the upper Allegheny River, mentioned in the
report of last year, and the search for journals of the Quaker missions
after 1798 has continued with some success. In this work Dr. Fenton
acknowledges the labors of Messrs. M. H. Deardorff, of Warren, Pa.,
and C. E. Congdon, of Salamanca, N. Y., in transcribing manuscript
sources and collecting much new material in the field.

The second project was conceived several years ago to fulfill a grow-
ing need among Americanists for an English edition of J. F. Lafitau’s
important but now rare Moeurs des Sauvages Ameriquains (2 vols.,
Paris, 1724). Dr. Elizabeth L. Moore, of Parkersburg, W. Va., one-
time member of the French department at St. Lawrence University,
has undertaken the translation, and at the end of the year had com-
pleted, under Dr. Fenton’s direction, the translation of those sections
in volume 1 which include Lafitau’s observations of the American sav-
ages at his mission among the Mohawks of Caughnawaga and the
Abenaki of nearby St. Francis, omitting for the most part long ex-
tracts from contemporary and earlier works that Lafitau felt obliged
to copy. In order to conserve the Bureau’s copy of this rare work, a
microfilm copy was made, which is fortunate since the original library
copy has been evacuated for the duration.

Early in March Dr. Fenton commenced compiling, with the help
of Drs. Métraux, Collins, and Steward, a cumulative list of anthropolo-
gists arriving in Washington for war work and the agencies in which
they were employed.

Following appointment to the Smithsonian War Committee on April
1, a large proportion of Dr. Fenton’s time and efforts have gone into
the work of the Committee, of which he has served as secretary At
his suggestion the Committee drafted and distributed questionnaires
soliciting basic data for “A roster of personnel, world travel, and spe-
cial knowledge available to war agencies at the Smithsonian Institu-
tion,” and by early June the roster had been ushered through a pre-
liminary and a first edition. The Smithsonian roster was patterned
after personnel lists of the Oceania committee of the old “Ethnographic
Board” of the National Research Council, and through these contacts
the Smithsonian participated in setting up the Ethnogeographic
Board. At the end of the fiscal year Dr. Fenton was detailed to act
as an assistant to the director of the Board, Dr, William Duncan
Strong.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 55

During the year, Dr. Fenton delivered several illustrated lectures
presenting some of the results of his studies of Iroquois culture.

At the end of the fiscal year a manuscript entitled “Songs from the
Iroquois Longhouse; Program Notes for an Album of American In-
dian Music from the Eastern Woodlands” was accepted for publica-
tion by the Institution to accompany an album of phonograph records
by the same title which the Archive of American Folk Song, Library
of Congress, is bringing out as volume 6 of Folk Music of the United
States.

Dr. Philip Drucker, assistant anthropologist, devoted the first half
of the fiscal year to analysis of the pottery collections made in 1941 by
the Smithsonian Institution-National Geographic Society expedition
at Cerro de las Mesas, Veracruz, Mexico, and the preparation of a re-
port on this material, Ceramic Stratigraphy at Cerro de las Mesas,
Veracruz. Thanks to the cooperation of the Department of Archeol-
ogy of the Mexican Government, he was able to study comparative col-
lections of materials stored in the Museo Nacional de Mexico from
adjacent regions, which greatly facilitated the placing of the Cerro de
las Mesas culture. It was found that this site was occupied from a
time level corresponding to that of Teotihuacan III of the Highland
cultures until shortly before the Spanish conquest. The Ninth Cycle
dates discovered in 1940 probably belong to the early period of oc-
cupation at Cerro de las Mesas. Of added interest is the fact that these
dates are not only of importance to the archeology of the Gulf Coast,
but in addition are the first actual carved dates even indirectly refer-
able to the important center of civilization of the Mexican Highland,
Teotihuacan. Following the period of Teotihuacan influence, a new
set of influences appeared, probably an actual immigration, of Mixte-
can people who brought with them their pottery craft, so that during
the Upper Period at Cerro de las Mesas great quantities of Mixtecan-
type (Cholultecan) wares were made. The modern designation of
this coastal region as the “Mistequilla,” incidentally, thus may be seen
to be a well-based ethnic identification.

In the latter part of January, Dr. Drucker set out for the site of La
Venta, in northwest Tabasco, where discoveries in 1940 indicated the
importance of the place as an ancient ceremonial center. Excavations
were carried out, aimed primarily at recovering stratigraphic material
for the analysis and placing of the site in relation to the Tres Zapotes
and Cerro de las Mesas “pottery yardsticks” established in former
years, and for comparisons with material from more distant sites as
well. Toward the end of the season some exploratory excavations were
undertaken in structures at the site, especially in the large ceremonial
patio. These efforts were rewarded by the finding of an elaborate
tomb of basalt columns, and a number of pieces of small but exquisitely
carved jade. Most of these jade pieces represent the little-known art
56 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

style often designated “Olmec,” and are among the first of such objects
to have been scientifically excavated. Their study will be important in
defining and placing this art in its proper cultural context.

At the conclusion of the work, the materials were brought to Mexico
City, where a division was made with the Department of Archeology
of the Mexican Government. The entire body of stratigraphic ma-
terials, and a part of the remaining objects, were then shipped to
Washington for purposes of study.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

At the beginning of the fiscal year, Miss Frances Densmore, a
collaborator of the Bureau, began the recording of Omaha songs at
Macy, Nebr., on the Omaha Reservation. Musical studies had been
made among the Omaha by Miss Alice C. Fletcher prior to 1893,
and Miss Densmore wished, if possible, to contact singers who had
recorded for Miss Fletcher and also to obtain duplicate recordings
for comparative purposes. Among the older Indians, Miss Dens-
more located three singers, Edward Cline, Benjamin Parker, and
Mattie Merrick White Parker, from whom songs had been obtained
by Miss Fletcher. Miss Densmore recorded 32 songs from this
group, including several which had been sung for Miss Fletcher.
Joseph Hamilton and Henry J. Springer, who had been too young
to sing for Miss Fletcher, were familiar with the songs of old war
societies and recorded 83 songs. A third group comprised younger
men, George R. Phillips, Robert Dale, and John G. Miller, from
whom 6 songs connected with the first World War were obtained.

Some of Miss Fletcher’s published Omaha songs were played on a
piano and were recognized by the Indians as having been recorded
for her. Miss Densmore obtained new recordings of these which
were transcribed and compared with the versions presented by Miss
Fletcher. It was noted that while the general effect of each melody
is the same in both versions, differences are rather marked. An ade-
quate comparison of the singing of these songs in the two periods
of time could be made only if the original recordings were available
for comparison with the records made in 1941. In contrast to the
differences in these serious songs, it was said that the song of the
hand game, presented by Miss Fletcher, is in use at the present time.
This was re-recorded for the present work, and the two versions
differ only in the omission in the new recording of a few bytones.
From this it appears that songs in common use are preserved among
the Omaha without change, while songs connected with ancient cus-
toms or ceremonies, which have not been sung for many years, are
being forgotten and will soon disappear.

Miss Densmore also obtained from Benjamin Parker a description
and a model of an old type of drum. In former times the cylinder
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 57

of this drum was a charred log, preferably of oak or elm. The
lower head was of hide from the lower part of a buffalo’s neck, and
the upper head, which was struck, was made of deer hide or the hide
from a hindquarter of an elk. These heads were laced together
with buffalo thongs and tightened with bits of wood in the lacing,
a custom not observed previously among the Indians.

During the year Miss Densmore arranged in final order 245 songs
to accompany her manuscript on Seminole music and revised por-
tions of the text to conform to this arrangement of the material.

In December 1941 Miss Densmore was appointed as consultant at
The National Archives for work in connection with the Smithso-
nian-Densmore collection of sound recordings of American Indian
music, and during the ensuing months she was engaged in planning
the organization of the collection.

LIBRARY

There has been no change in the library staff during the fiscal year.
Accessions during the fiscal year totaled 350. Volumes received by
exchange have fallen off sharply owing to the war, which has prac-
tically stopped exchange except from Great Britain and her posses-
sions and from South America. Several new exchange sets have been
started during the year.

The reclassification of the library is practically completed. The
foreign society transactions and the foreign periodicals have been
reshelved and a temporary shelflist made. The publications of Indian
schools and missions have been classified, reshelved, and a temporary
shelflist made. All available Library of Congress cards for periodi-
cals in our collection have been obtained, and these cards have been
sorted and will be prepared as soon as time permits.

The rare-book collection has been classified, reshelved, and shelf-
listed, and Library of Congress cards were obtained for nearly all this
collection. About 600 volumes of the rare-book collection were
packed for shipment to war storage in April.

New books received during the year have been classified and shelf-
listed and are now on the shelf. The usual work of recording new
periodicals and society transactions and examining them for material
of interest and for book reviews has been kept up to date.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 59

A beginning has been made on bringing analytical entries up to
date. The American Anthropologist, American Journal of Physical
Anthropology, American Antiquity, and other important sets have
been brought up to date with main cards only. Other sets and sub-
ject entries remain to be done.

The librarian attended the meetings of the Inter-American Biblio-
graphical and Library Society in February 1942, and assisted in the
formation of a Map and Geography group in the Washington chapter
of the Special Libraries Association. Talks by the librarian on the
library and the rare-book collection were given before the Map group
of the Special Libraries Association on January 6, 1942, and before
the Museum group on March 10, 1942,

ILLUSTRATIONS

During the year Mr. E. G. Cassedy, illustrator, continued the
preparation of illustrations, maps, and drawings for the publications
of the Bureau and for those of other branches of the Institution.

COLLECTIONS

Collections transferred by the Bureau of American Ethnology to
the Department of Anthropology, United States National Museum,
during the fiscal year were as follows:

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the International Exchange Service for the fiscal year ended
June 80, 1942:

The congressional appropriation for the Exchanges was $44,880,
the same amount granted for the previous year. As was done last
year, the Department of State transferred $500 to the Exchange
Service from an appropriation made by Congress to that Department
for carrying on its work of increasing the cultural relations between
the United States and other American republics. This amount was
used by the Exchange Service to send packages directly to corre-
spondents in Argentina and Brazil by mail instead of forwarding
them in boxes to exchange bureaus for distribution, thereby greatly
reducing the time required for packages to reach their destinations.
To all other South and Central American countries, as well as to
Canada, Cuba, Dominican Republic, Haiti, Mexico, and Newfound-
land, packages of publications are transmitted by mail under govern-
mental frank. The $500 was not sufficient to meet the entire cost of
postage on all the packages for Argentina and Brazil but the extra
amount needed for this item was met from the congressional appro-
priation for the Exchanges. The total available resources for carry-
ing on the exchange work was $48,505.50, there having been received
during the year on account of repayments $3,125.50.

During the year 561,151 packages passed through the service, a
decrease from last year of 15,181. The weight was 326,406 pounds,
a decrease of 62,243 pounds. The publications sent and received
through the Exchange Service are classified under three heads:
Parliamentary documents, departmental documents, and miscellane-
ous scientific and literary publications. The term “parliamentary
documents,” as here used, refers to publications set aside by act of
Congress for exchange with foreign governments, and includes not
only documents printed by order of either House of Congress, but
also copies of each publication issued by any department, bureau,
commission, or officer of the Government. Governments to which
this class of publications are forwarded send to this country in ex-
change copies of their own official documents for deposit in the Library
of Congress. The term “departmental documents” embraces publica-

61
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

tions delivered at the Institution by governmental departments, bu-
reaus, or commissions for distribution to their correspondents abroad.
Publications received in return are deposited in the various depart-
mental libraries. ‘Miscellaneous scientific and literary publications”
are received chiefly from learned societies, universities, colleges, scien-
tific institutions, and museums in the United States for transmission
to similar establishments in all parts of the world.

Detailed figures under these three headings are given in the
following table:

Packages are forwarded abroad partly by freight to exchange
bureaus for distribution and partly by mail directly to their destina-
tions. The number of boxes shipped was 599, a decrease from last
year of 366. Of these boxes 304 were for depositories of full sets
of governmental documents and the contents of the remainder (295)
were for depositories of partial sets and for various establishments
and individuals. The number of mail packages was 127,454.

The work of the Service is still greatly interfered with by the war,
which at the close of the year had resulted in the suspension of ship-
ments of exchanges to all countries in the Eastern Hemisphere except
Great Britain and the Union of South Africa. In the Western
Hemisphere, where packages are forwarded to their destinations by
mail, mostly under governmental frank, there has been no interrup-
tion to the sending of packages, although some delay results from
their examination by the Office of Censorship before being allowed
to leave the United States.

The dates of the last shipments to the countries to which the send-
ing of consignments was suspended during the year are given below:

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

There now are received at the Institution for transmission through
the International Exchange Service to foreign depositories 55 full
sets and 86 partial sets of United States governmental documents—
a total of 91 sets. At the close of the year no sets of governmental
documents were being forwarded to any countries in the Eastern
Hemisphere. In the Western Hemisphere the full and partial series
were being transmitted after eliminating those publications not
allowed to be exported by the Office of Censorship because they were
considered to contain matter of possible aid to the enemy. All the
publications forming the full and partial sets of governmental docu-
ments now being held will be forwarded at the close of the war.

The depository in South Australia was changed from the Parlia-
mentary Library to the Public Library. The partial sets sent to the
Straits Settlements and the State of Rio de Janeiro were discontinued.
The Biblioteca Nacional in San Salvador was added to the list of
depositories of those sets.

APPENDIX 7
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1942:

The regular appropriation made by Congress was $239,260, all of
which was expended with the exception of $4,000, which represents
savings of salaries for positions not filled.

PERSONNEL

In common with other agencies, the Zoo has had considerable per-
sonnel turn-over, losing a number of its capable employees through
transfer to military service. These have been replaced, as far as
possible, with employees who will serve for the duration and until
the return of the regular staff.

IMPROVEMENTS

The cessation of W. P. A. work and the conditions resulting from
the war have prevented the making of material improvements.
Before our entry into the war, a small amount of work was done at
the reptile pit in front of the reptile house to improve its appearance
as a natural habitat area.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

The needs of the Zoo remain the same as outlined in previous
reports. On account of war conditions, no request is being made for
unusual expenditures at this time.

VISITORS FOR THE YEAR

The attendance for the year was slightly more than that for last
year. The tire and gasoline rationing which went into effect in late
spring brought about a perceptible increase in visitors by bus and
streetcar and on foot.

REPORT OF THE SECRETAFY a

The attendance of organizations, mainly classes of students, of
which there is definite record, was 10,660, from 212 different schools
or groups in 15 States and the District of Columbia. This large
decrease from last year of visitors in this group was due mainly to
restrictions on chartered bus travel which went into effect the first
part of June, a month during which the largest number of schools
or classes usually visit the Zoo. A complete listing by States follows:

As in preceding years, a census was made every afternoon at about
3 o’clock of the cars parked on the Zoo ground. During the year
56,585 cars were so listed, representing every State in the Union, as
well as Alaska, Brazil, Canal Zone, Cuba, Guatemala, Haiti, Hawaii,
Mexico, Puerto Rico, Panama, Philippine Islands, and Venezuela.

This count is not of value as showing a total attendance, but only
as indicating the percentage of attendance by States. The record
for the year shows that the District of Columbia automobiles com-
prised 89 percent, Maryland 22 percent, Virginia 15 percent, Penn-
sylvania 4 percent; and the remaining 20 percent were from other
States, Territories, and countries.

The attendance at the Zoo reflects changed conditions incident to
the war. Formerly there were relatively few visitors in the early
days of the week and in the mornings, but now there is a pronounced
increase during these periods, so that the highs and lows of attendance
are less pronounced.

Owing to the large increase in Washington population, the local
attendance at the Zoo has so increased that it offsets the decrease in the
number of transient visitors brought about by the curtailment of
automobile travel.

Large numbers of men in uniform are enjoying their first oppor-
tunity to visit a large zoo, and some groups of injured or sick are
brought by nurses or Red Cross drivers. The Zoo continues to he a
regular study ground for art and biology classes, as well as an impor-
tant focal point for letters, telephone calls, and personal queries
regarding animals, their behavior, and methods to be followed in
preventing or remedying injuries from animals, how to care for
animals, and many miscellaneous questions.
72 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942
AIR-RAID PRECAUTIONS

So far as can be learned, the experience of other zoos in the war
area suggests that the National Zoological Park will probably be one
of the safest places about Washington during air raids. By the very
nature of the construction of most of the cages, it is practically certain
that any dangerous animal would be killed if it were in a cage
damaged badly enough to let the animal escape.

The Zoo has endeavored to take precautions to provide for such
contingencies as may arise. A number of key men have received
instruction regarding incendiary bombs, gas bombs, and first aid,
and the entire organization has been instructed and drilled in taking
their respective posts during daylight tests and raids. The personnel
bas been divided into groups, so that in the event of attacks becoming
imminent, the practice will be inaugurated of requiring some of the
personnel to remain in the Zoo overnight, in order to be available in
the event of emergency. This is with the idea of having trained men
for emergencies at night, as well as during daytime.

ACCESSIONS
FIELD WORK

On account of world conditions, no expeditions were sent abroad;
hence the Zoo did not receive the large numbers of animals that are
usually brought in by such efforts.

GIFTS

Among important gifts during the year was a magnificent Texas
longhorn steer from the ranch of Col. T. T. East, brought to Wash-
ington through the courtesy of the Texas and Southwestern Cattle
Raisers Association. The animal was presented to the Zoo by the
Texas State Society through the Honorable Wright Patman, and, as
the first of its kind ever to be shown in the collection, it has attracted
a great deal of attention.

A pet mule deer fawn was received from L. S. Marriott, Soda
Springs, Idaho. Dr. Carlos G. Aguayo, of Habana, Cuba, presented
a very rare Cuban crocodile (Crocodylus rhombifer), the first ever
exhibited here. Otto Martin Locke, of New Braunfels, Tex., pre-
sented a large number of horned lizards and a nine-banded armadillo.
From Kenly Chiles, of Washington, D. C., was received a guenon
monkey.

Dr. Thomas Barbour, Director of the Museum of Comparative Zool-
ogy at Cambridge, Mass., presented two extra large and fine specimens
of the African lungfish, which he had kept for observation since 1937.

EXCHANGES

A splendid pair of British Park cattle was received in exchange
from the Zoo at Toronto, Canada; and from W. A. King, at Browns-
ville, Tex., were received 6 Yucatan jays, 4 Mexican caciques, a pair
of spider monkeys, 4 red-bellied squirrels, and a pair of West High-
land or Kyloe cattle,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 17
PURCHASES

Important specimens acquired by purchase were a secretary bird;
a number of South African snakes, which were obtained from the
Fitzsimons’ Snake Farm, Durban, South Africa; 6 two-toed sloths;
a pair of raccoon dogs; and a pair of East African wart hogs. Also
purchased during the year were a pair of guanacos and a pair of
single-humped camels. This provides specimens of all living forms

of the camel family.
REMOVALS

Many of the poisonous reptiles have been removed from the Zoo,
leaving so few in the collection that they can be instantly disposed
of should the occasion require.

In the report for 1941, there was described a very serious loss of
birds resulting from an epidemic of psittacosis in the bird house. The
bird house was closed to the public for about 3 months, and at the
beginning of this fiscal year the parrot room was still closed. A
release from quarantine for the parrot section was received from
the District of Columbia Health Department on September 27, 1941,
and the room was reopened to visitors several days later.

Through splendid assistance and cooperation on the part of the
United States Public Health Service and the District of Columbia
Health Department this disease has been eradicated. Suspected birds
that die are sent to the Public Health Service for examination, and
for nearly a year the results of the examination have all been negative.

DEATHS

The principal losses for the past year have been of very old resi-
dents. A sulphur-crested cockatoo, which was presented by Richard
znd Harry Hunt, Bethesda, Md., April 19, 1890, before the present
Zoo was actually established, died June 20, 1942, after 52 years and
2 months in the Zoo. It had been a pet of the Hunt family for 5
years before coming to the Park. It had come to the United States
in a sailing ship around Cape Horn.

The female reticulated giraffe which had been received June 21,
1939, died April 24, 1942. Other losses by death of animals which
also had been in the Zoo for long periods included an Alaska Pen-
insula bear in the collection 19 years; Baird’s tapir, in the Zoo since
May, 1924; and a Malay porcupine that had lived here for 22 years.

The American bald eagle, “Jerry,” probably the most photographed
bird in the world, died April 15, 1942. It had come as a gift from
President Wilson and had been a Zoo resident for 26 years. Photo-
graphs of “Jerry” were used as models for the eagle on our defense
posters.
78 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

As usual, all specimens of scientific value that died during the year
were sent to the National Museum

SPECIES NEW TO THE HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION

Very few exotic specimens were acquired during the year, and these
were mainly replacements. The collection was augmented by the addi-
tion of three different types of cattle which had never been exhibited
here before They were a Texas longhorn steer, a pair of British
Park cattle, and a pair of West Highland or Kyloe cattle.

REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal year ended June
30, 1942:

WORK AT WASHINGTON

PUBLICATION OF VOLUME 6 OF THE ANNALS

The outstanding event was the completion and publication of
volume 6 of the Annals of the Observatory. The volume begins with
extracts from these reports continuing the annals of the Observatory
operations from 1931 to 1940. Next, the principal research on the
variation of the sun’s radiation is minutely described, with illustra-
tive graphical and tabular matter relating to every feature. Then
follow 78 quarto tabular pages giving in detail daily results of
observation of the solar constant of radiation (i. e., the intensity of
the sun’s rays as they exist at mean solar distance outside the earth’s
atmosphere). This table covers all observations over the interval
from 1923 to 1939 at Montezuma, Chile; Table Mountain, Calif.; and
Mount St. Katherine, Egypt. The results are given in 12 columns
for each day, covering not only the final results at each station, but
the more important observations leading up to them. For some
individual dates as many as 12 lines are required. Each page of the
Annals includes 3 such groups of columns or 86 in all, and each page
has approximately 80 lines. The enormous task of preparing this
table has been mentioned repeatedly in preceding reports.

Then follows a chapter on the derived results and conclusions based
on this great tabular compilation, and including related additional
information for the years 1920 to 1928, derived from volume 5 of the
Annals.

As regards accuracy, the probable accidental error of a single day’s
determination of the solar constant from observations at the stations
is one-sixth of 1 percent, and for 10-day and monthly means, it is
one-ninth and one-twentieth of 1 percent, respectively.

The variation of the sun, as our life-supporting star, is clearly
indicated and between extreme ranges up to about 3 percent for the
interval 1920 to 1939. It is verified not only by comparisons of our

79
80 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

own radiation observations at widely separated stations but by com-
parison of them with the publications of visual and photographic
studies of the sun’s surface made at other observatories. Such com-
parisons show, for instance, that the rotation of the sun upon its
axis in the approximate period of 27 days frequently is attended by
1 percent change in solar radiation associated with well-marked
changes in the visual and photographic appearance of the sun.

The variation of the sun is shown not to be of uniform percentage
for all colors and wave lengths, but to increase rapidly in percentage
toward the shorter wave lengths of the violet and ultraviolet rays.
For ultraviolet rays of wave length 3500 angstroms, the percentage
variation is 6 times as great as for the solar radiation as a whole.

Fourteen simultaneously operative regular periodicities are found
in solar radiation ranging from 8 months to 273 months in periods.
Each of these is reflected in temperatures and precipitations recorded
by meteorological observations of official weather services. Long
records, extending for 140 years, like those of Copenhagen, Vienna,
and New Haven, prove that the 14 solar periodic variations have
continued in unchanged phases, though perhaps not in unchanged
amplitudes, during all that interval. Assuming that the phases will
continue unchanged, and the amplitudes will be the average of
amplitudes since 1920, a prediction of the solar variation to 1945 is
hazarded.

The publication of volume 6 of the Annals, in such beautiful form
and at so early a date, was made possible by funds generously sup-
plied by Mr. John A. Roebling. Without his long-continued and
munificent support and advice, the research could not have reached
this satisfactory fruition. It is greatly hoped that it will furnish
valuable aids to the science of meteorology.

TRANSFER OF THE DIVISION OF RADIATION AND ORGANISMS

A second outstanding event of the year is the acceptance by the
Bureau of the Budget and the Congress of the proposal, strongly
recommended by the Regents of the Institution, that the Division of
Radiation and Organisms, hitherto for 18 years supported by private
funds, and hitherto concerned with the fundamental study of plant
growth, be incorporated as a branch of the Astrophysical Observa-
tory. Since the beginning of the fiscal year 1942, this interesting
fundamental research has been supported by Congressional appropria-
tions, and its staff has been a part of the Government Civil Service.

INSTRUMENTS

Our detailed studies of the observations of the solar radiation
disclosed, as above said, that the percentage variation of the intensity
of the sun’s rays is six times as great for ultraviolet rays as for the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Sl

total of all wave lengths. It also appeared plainly that the chief
source of error remaining in the determinations arises from uncer-
tainty of the exact effect of absorption in the great infrared water-
vapor bands, occurring in a spectral region where solar variation is
almost nil.

These considerations led the Director to devise a method whereby
with a few additional observations using special glass absorbing
screens determinations of solar variation could be restricted to the
spectral region of the green, blue, violet, and ultraviolet rays.
Apparatus for such determinations was prepared at our Washington
instrument shop and has been installed at all three of the field sta-
tions. It has been in regular use at all of them since about July
1941 in addition to the ordinary observing.

It also appeared that certain types of sky conditions tended to
produce unsatisfactory results by our present usual methods of
observing the solar constant of radiation. It seemed possible that
if in addition to our usual measurements we should observe the
degree of polarization prevailing in sky light a correction of value
might be discovered and applied in our daily measurements. Ac-
cordingly three copies of a sky polarization device invented by the late
Prof. E. C. Pickering have been prepared at our Washington instru-
ment shop. One is already installed at Montezuma, Chile, and has
been used regularly since March 1942. Such instruments will soon
be in use at our other stations.

Considerable special confidential work for military purposes has
been done at our Washington instrument shop under the care of the
Director.

The Assistant Director, Mr. L. B. Aldrich, has devoted a good
deal of time as a member of the Smithsonian War Committee.

FIELD WORK

Three solar radiation observing stations have been operated on
all favorable days at Table Mountain, Calif., Burro Mountain, N.
Mex. (called the Tyrone station), and at Montezuma, Chile. The
meteorological conditions have been rather less favorable than usual
at all three stations, but still solar-constant observations were made
on a majority of days at all stations,

New reinforced concrete dwelling quarters for the director’s fam-
ily at Montezuma were completed under field director Freeman’s
direction and finished shortly before he was relieved by A. F. Moore
in July 1941, and in May 1942 the assistant’s quarters were rebuilt
to a considerable extent.

Improvements were also made at Table Mountain and Tyrone
stations. A new water supply was installed at the former, and the
drainage of the observing tunnel was perfected at the latter.
82 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942
PERSONNEL CHANGES

A. Kramer, instrument maker, retired, was restored to the active
Civil Service at Washington under war regulations on March 16,
1942. A. F. Moore relieved H. B. Freeman, resigned, at Montezuma
as field director in July 1941, and F. A. Greeley relieved James H.
Baden as bolometric assistant there in April 1942. W. H. Hoover
continued as field director at Tyrone station, relieving A. ¥. Moore.
Thomas Hassard served from October 6, 1941, to April 16, 1942, as
bolometric assistant at Table Mountain, relieving F. A. Greeley.
On Hassard’s resignation to enter military service, he was followed
by Kenneth G. Bower in May 1942. Miss N. M. McCandlish, special
assistant to the Director, resigned March 1942.

The following members of the staff of the Division of Radiation
and Organisms were transferred to the staff of the Astrophysical
Observatory on July 1, 1941, under authorization of the Civil Service
Commission: Robert M. Clagett, Leland B. Clark, Earl S. Johnston,
Edward D. McAlister, and Robert L. Weintraub,

APPENDIX 9

REPORT ON THE DIVISION OF RADIATION AND
ORGANISMS

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activities
of the Division of Radiation and Organisms during the year ended
June 380, 1942:

Many changes have taken place in both personnel and physical equip-
ment of the Division of Radiation and Organisms during the past year.
Members of the Division were given Civil Service status on July 1,
1941, and the work is now carried on from appropriations allotted to
the Astrophysical Observatory. The laboratory has been remodeled
and most of the rooms repainted. The removal of the pipe shop to the
United States National Museum made available much needed space
and has relieved the crowded condition that existed. These changes
brought about considerable temporary disruption in the regular work.

Different members of the Division have contributed directly or indi-
rectly to work pertaining to war activities. The regular research work
may, for convenience, be placed under three group headings: Photo-
synthesis, plant growth and radiation, and development of apparatus
and methods.

Dr. Jack E. Myers continued his work with algae on problems related
to photosynthesis until the expiration of his National Research Fellow-
ship grant in September. He devised a method for the contiuous cul-
ture of algae with equipment built in the Division’s laboratory. This
apparatus he took with him to continue the work at the University
of Texas as a cooperative project with our Division. The bearing this
work has on our general program is that of obtaining uniform biologi-
cal material that will give reproducible results under similar experi-
mental conditions.

Mrs. Florence Meier Chase completed her study on the economic uses
of algae and submitted a paper covering the subject for publication in
the Smithsonian Annual Report for 1941.

Dr. Weintraub has completed a comprehensive review of the litera-
ture on plant respiration as affected by radiation. This was requested
by Botanical Review, a journal which specializes in the publication of
comprehensive technical reviews in the botanical field. This review
is especially useful as a background in some of our investigations.

83
501591—43-—7
84 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

Drs. Johnston and Weintraub have continued their experiments on
the factors that influence the change in rates of respiration. This, of
course, is basic work to our main project on photosynthesis. Our
results lead one to speculate on the possibility of the existence of a
carbon dioxide reservoir connected with the cell mechanism. It would
seem that when the plants are conditioned in air of high carbon dioxide
content a certain amount of excess carbon dioxide is stored in the tissue
so that subsequent measurements of “apparent respiration” would con-
sist of the carbon dioxide liberated by true respiration and that re-
leased from a well-filled reservoir. If, however, the plants are condi-
tioned in air with little or no carbon dioxide the hypothetical reservoir
is in a partially depleted condition and the first few periods of “ap-
parent respiration” show a gradual increase in rate. This would be
caused by the trapping in the reservoir of less and less of the respired
carbon dioxide, thereby liberating more and more carbon dioxide
which could be detected in the atmosphere surrounding the plant.

Such a reservoir hypothesis, however, is not sufficient to account for
all the results obtained. There is evidence in much of our data that
the humidity of the air plays an important role in this gaseous ex-
change, perhaps in changing the size of stomatal openings. Just what
mechanism is involved in these plant responses is not yet clear. The
answer must await improvements of the humidity controls of the
apparatus. Such improvements are now being undertaken.

The relationship previously found by Dr. Weintraub between light
intensity and inhibition of growth of the oats mesocotyl suggests
that two growth proceses are influenced by light; one alone at low
intensities and both together at higher intensities. It appears likely
that these two processes are cell elongation and cell division, respec-
tively. In order to determine the action spectra for the two processes,
and so to obtain an insight into their mechanisms, information on the
intensity relations in various spectral regions is required. Such
information has previously been obtained for a number of wave bands
at low intensities, using a double monochromator. In extending the
study to higher intensities, this method is not feasible and use must
be made of emission spectra furnishing lines of adequate intensity
and purity. Such lines as are available are now being studied over
a wide intensity range and the plant material is being preserved for
future histological study.

The action spectrum (maximum activity in the red) found for the
mesocotyl inhibition at low intensities indicates the presence in the
etiolated plant of a photoreceptive pigment possessing a similar
absorption spectrum. An attempt to isolate such a pigment has been
begun. The evidence thus far obtained points to the occurrence in
the dark-grown oats seedling of traces of at least two pigments having
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 85

absorption bands in the red region of the spectrum. Work on the
isolation and separation of these pigments is now in progress,

in view of the previous finding by Drs. Johnston and Weintraub,
using the spectrographic method, that illumination increases the rate
of carbon dioxide production by etiolated barley seedlings, it is of
considerable interest to study the influence of radiation on the
respiration of other types of plants. For this purpose the Warburg
manometric technique seems well adapted, since both oxygen absorp-
tion and carbon dioxide evolution can be measured simultaneously.
The necessary apparatus is being assembled and preliminary experi-
ments to find suitable types of plant material and appropriate cultural
conditions are under way. The data in the literature as well as
results already obtained in this laboratory indicate that the effects of
radiation on respiration may be intimately related to the previous
cultural history of the plant.

PERSONNEL

Dr. Jack E. Myers, whose National Research Fellowship grant
terminated in September, has been appointed assistant professor in
the department of zoology and physiology at the University of Texas.

Mrs. Florence Meier Chase, who has been with the Division for 10
years, resigned on September 9.

On October 1 the services of Dr. E. D. McAlister were transferred
to the Carnegie Institution of Washington for the purpose of carrying
on war work.

Leonard Price was appointed junior physical science aid on Feb-
ruary 16, 1942.

Mrs. Phyllis W. Prescott was appointed junior clerk-stenographer
on March 24, 1942.

REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the Smithsonian Library for the fiscal year ended June 30,
1942:

War’s initial impact upon the normal activities of a scientific
library is disconcerting and disruptive. Publication of new material
in the combatant countries declines, and such books and periodicals
as are issued are obtainable with difficulty, if indeed they can be
obtained at all. In the important scientific journals gaps appear and
widen. As a consequence, service to readers becomes more limited.
The whole immediate outlook for growth and accomplishment is dis-
couraging.

Since September 1939 the Smithsonian Library has suffered in
common with all other libraries of international scope, and as long
as the war lasts it must continue to suffer from this negative influence
which progressively decreases the inflow of material important for
the work of the Institution and its branches. After Pearl Harbor
came the final cutting off of all importations from enemy and occu-
pied countries. The disruptive effect upon the normal activity of the
library is graphically illustrated by the fact that during the fiscal
year just ended 425 packages were received from abroad through the
International Exchange Service, whereas in a recent pre-war year
the number was 2,194.

Recovery from this serious crippling of the library’s facilities will
be slow, and the work of repair and of rebuilding will constitute a
challenge to diligence and ingenuity during post-war years.

Fortunately, there is a positive, constructive, and much brighter
side to the year’s activities. Especially is this true of the library’s
relation to the war effort. The primary purpose of the library in
normal times is service to the Institution’s many specialists engaged
in a wide range of studies covering the natural and physical sciences.
A basic requirement for progress in any line of science is constant
access to the published results of research in all countries. The large
body of scientific literature accumulated in the years since the foun-
dation of the Institution for the special needs of its staff has been
found to provide valuable material of great importance to the various
war agencies. As a result of this there has been a large increase in

86
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 87

the reference use of the library, especially in the branch library in the
National Museum, including both personal visits and requests by
telephone for information. This has also increased the loan to out-
side libraries, which were 218 more than last year.

In addition to providing access to published material and recorded
information, the library has been able to extend its war reference
service by putting inquirers directly in touch with members of the
staff of the Institution having special professional or personal know!-
edge of various subjects. By knowing where, how, and from whom
information not available in the Institution itself may be obtained,
the library has also been enabled to arrange valuable introductions
to outside sources. This kind of service, through which the library
functions not only as a bibliographical center, but also as a general
clearinghouse for information, is expanding and offers promising
possibilities for more extensive future assistance in the war effort.

Upon recommendation of the Smithsonian War Committee and
as a part of the Institution’s program for directing its activities more
definitely to the war effort, the library was instructed by the Secre-
tary in April to prepare an index of the foreign geographical illustra-
tions that have appeared in Smithsonian publications. Work was
begun immediately, and before the end of the fiscal year the index-
ing of the Smithsonian Explorations and Field-Work series had
been completed and work begun on other publications. Records of
some 2,000 illustrations have been made and filed both alphabetically
and by regions.

In spite of the time given to special war activities, routine duties
of the library were well kept up. The acquisition of new material
by purchase and exchange, the cataloging of books, the entering
of periodicals, the preparation of volumes for binding, the keeping
of loan-desk records, all are exact and time-consuming processes,
upon which the smooth functioning of the library depends. Statistics
of them, so far as they can be measured statistically, will be found
at the end of this report.

Routine reference work for the staff of the Institution, and the
use of books within the various libraries, of which no numerical
count is attempted, continued to be heavy.

Although considerably handicapped by a temporarily curtailed
staff, the decrease in the number of accessions from Europe and Asia
has made it possible for the catalogers to devote some small part of
their time to the recataloging of older material that has long needed
attention. Full use of many of our most valuable series of publica-
tions has always been difficult because analysis of them has never
been made for the catalog. Accurate identification of references and
prompt delivery of material wanted are basic to good library service,
especially from the loan desk, and they are largely dependent upon
88 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

good cataloging. It is hoped, as one of the compensations for the
decrease in foreign accessions, to be able to continue and extend this
program for making our already acquired resources more fully and
easily usable.

In the matter of exchanges, a comparable program is in progress.
With no immediate possibility of filling gaps in our files of foreign
serials from sources abroad in direct exchange for our own publica-
tions, we are using, and are studying how to make further use of,
our large and valuable duplicate collection for strengthening and
extending our domestic exchanges. Lists of desiderata exchanged
with other institutions are bringing good results in finding parts
needed to complete incomplete serial files in all the participating
libraries. Many of our duplicates, too, are given directly to other
Government libraries that need them. Notably, in response to a
request from the Scientific Library of the Patent Office, we were able
this year to supply 1,524 parts of periodicals lacking in their sets.

GIFTS

Friends and patrons made generous gifts to the library. The
Secretary, the Assistant Secretary, and other members and collabo-
rators of the Smithsonian staff contributed many publications. The
American Museum of Natural History, the Boston Museum of Fine
Arts, and other institutions with which we are regularly in ex-
change made us special gifts in addition. From the American,
Association for the Advancement of Science came 724 publications,
and 68 were received from the American Association of Museums.
A noteworthy gift, numbering some 2,000 items, was the library on
Copepoda assembled by the late Dr. Charles Branch Wilson and
presented by his son, Carroll A. Wilson, to the Division of Marine
Invertebrates. A card index for use with the collection accompanied
it. Of special interest was Mrs. Cyrus Adler’s gift of the post-
humously published book, I Have Remembered the Days, the autobi-
ography of the late Dr. Cyrus Adler, formerly librarian of the
Institution. Other donors were, Percy S. Alden, Theodore Bolton,
Willard C. Brinton, L. V. Coleman, Dr. P. T. Collinge, Miss Elsie
G. Curry, Dr. Carl Epling, Mrs. Paul Garber, The Board of Directors
of the Golden Gate Bridge and Highway District, Dr. John M.
Hiss, R. G. Ingersoll Waite, Prof. James R. Jack, Dr. Thomas H.
Kearney, Dr. Riley D. Moore, Dr. W. L. McAtee, The National
Society of Colonial Dames of America, Dr. T. L. Northup, Mrs.
Foster Stearns, Prof. Theodore Sizer.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 89
PERSONNEL

Most important of the unusually large number of changes on the
staff was the retirement of William L. Corbin as librarian on January
31, 1942, after more than 17 years of service. Coming to the Insti-
tution in the early years after the First World War, he was con-
fronted with many difficult tasks of rehabilitation and administra-
tion. He gave his best efforts to the completion of important files
of scientific journals broken by the war, to the reestablishment and
extension of exchange relationships and to the building up of an
efficient library personnel for the service of the Institution.

On F ee 2, 1942, Mrs. Leila F. Clark, who had been assistant
librarian in charge of the National Museum library since 1929, was
appointed librarian of the Institution.

Miss Elisabeth P. Hobbs, head cataloger, was promoted on May
91, 1942, to the position of associate librarian in charge of the Mu-
seum library. Mrs. Lucile Torrey Barrett, who had given excep-
tional service as librarian of the National Collection of Fine Arts,
was transferred to a war agency on February 238, 1942. Other
changes were the resignation of Miss Ruth Blanchard on October 31,
1941, and the appointments of Miss Marjorie Kunze and Miss Marion
Blair on January 5, 1942. The temporary appointments of Mrs.
Georgeanna H. Morrill and Mrs. Clara Dick, made during the pre-
ceding fiscal year, were terminated on December 31, 1941. Assistant
messengers for short periods were Arthur Gambrell and John
Barnes. Samuel Jones, who is now serving, was appointed May 5.

FREER GALLERY OF ART FUND

Early in 1906, by deed of gift, Charles L. Freer, of Detroit, gave to
the Institution his collection of Chinese and other Oriental objects
of art, as well as paintings, etchings, and other works of art by
Whistler, Thayer, Dewing, and other artists. Later he also gave
funds for the construction of a building to house the collection, and
finally in his will, probated November 6, 1919, he provided stock and
securities to the estimated value of $1,958,591.42 as an endowment
fund for the operation of the gallery. From the above date to the
present time these funds have been increased by stock dividends, sav-
ings of income, etc., to a total of $5,912,878.64. In view of the im-
portance and special nature of the gift and the requirements of the
testator in respect to it, all Freer funds are kept separate from the
other funds of the Institution, and the accounting in respect to them
is stated separately.

ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the GenrraAt AprENpIx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such papers
as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. ‘This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1942.

THE 1914 TESTS OF THE LANGLEY “AERODROME”?

By C. G. ABBOT

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution

Note.—This paper has been submitted to Dr. Orville Wright, and under date of
October 8, 1942, he states that the paper as now prepared will be acceptable to him
if given adequate publication.

It is everywhere acknowledged that the Wright brothers were the
first to make sustained flights in a heavier-than-air machine at Kitty
Hawk, North Carolina, on December 17, 1903.

Mainly because of acts and statements of former officers of the
Smithsonian Institution, arising from tests made with the recondi-
tioned Langley plane of 1903 at Hammondsport, New York, in 1914,
Dr. Orville Wright feels that the Institution adopted an unfair and
injurious attitude. He therefore sent the original Wright Kitty Hawk
plane to England in 1928. The nature of the acts and statements
referred to are as follows:

In March 1914, Secretary Walcott contracted with Glenn H. Curtiss
to attempt a flight with the Langley machine. This action seems ill
considered and open to criticism. For in January 1914, the United
States Court of Appeals, Second Circuit, had handed down a decision
recognizing the Wrights as “pioneers in the practical art of flying with
heavier-than-air machines” and pronouncing Glenn H. Curtiss an in-
fringer of their patent. Hence, in view of probable further litigation,
the Wrights stood to lose in fame and revenue and Curtiss stood to gain
pecuniarily, should the experiments at Hammondsport indicate that
Langley’s plane was capable of sustained flight in 1908, previous to the
successful flights made December 17, 1903, by the Wrights at Kitty
Hawk, N. C.

The machine was shipped to Curtiss at Hammondsport, N. Y., in
April. Dr. Zahm, the Recorder of the Langley Aerodynamical Lab-
oratory and expert witness for Curtiss in the patent litigation, was at
Hammondsport as official representative of the Smithsonian Institu-

1 Reprinted from Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, vol. 103, No. 8, Oct. 24, 1942.
For an account of early Langley and Wright aeronautical investigations, see Smithsonian
Report for 1900 and The Century Magazine of September 1908.

111
112 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

tion during the time the machine was being reconstructed and tested.
In the reconstruction the machine was changed from what it was in
1903 in a number of particulars as given in Dr. Wright’s list of dif-
ferences which appears later in this paper. On the 28th of May and
the 2d of June, 1914, attempts to fly were made. After acquiring speed
by running on hydroplane floats on the surface of Lake Keuka the
machine lifted into the air several different times. The longest time
off the water with the Langley motor was approximately five seconds.
Dr. Zahm stated that “it was apparent that owing to the great weight
which had been given to the structure by adding the floats it was nec-
essary to increase the propeller thrust”. So no further attempts were
made to fly with the Langley 52 HP engine.

It is to be regretted that the Institution published statements re-
peatedly * to the effect that these experiments of 1914 demonstrated
that Langley’s plane of 1908 without essential modification was the
first heavier-than-air machine capable of maintaining sustained human
flight.

As first exhibited in the United States National Museum, January
15, 1918, the restored Langley plane of 1903 bore the following label:

THE ORIGINAL, FULL-SIZE
LANGLEY FLYING MACHINE, 1903

For this simple label others were later substituted containing the claim
that Langley’s machine “was the first man-carrying aeroplane in the
history of the world capable of sustained free flight.”

Though the matter of the label is not now an issue, it seems only
fair to the Institution to say that in September 1928, Secretary Abbot
finally caused the label of the Langley machine to be changed to read
simply as follows:

LANGLEY AERODROME

THE ORIGINAL SAMUEL PIERPONT LANGLEY
FLYING MACHINE OF 1903, RESTORED.

Deposited by
The Smithsonian Institution
301,613

This change has frequently been overlooked by writers on the
controversy.

In January 1942, Mr. Fred C. Kelly, of Peninsula, Ohio, communi-
cated to me a list of differences between the Langley plane as tested
in 1914 and as tested in 1903, which he had received from Dr. Wright.

24 LATERAL STABILITY: The dihedral
only was used for maintaining lat-
eral balance. (LL. M. p. 45).

25 LONGITUDINAL STABILITY: Langley
relied upon the Penaud system of
inherent stability for maintaining
the longitudinal equilibrium. “For
the preservation of the equilibrium
[longitudinal] of the aerodrome,
though the aviator might assist by
such slight movements as he was
able to make in the limited space of
the aviator’s car, the main reliance
was upon the Penaud tail.” (l. M.
p. 215).

STEERING: Steering in the horizontal
plane was done entirely by the split-
vane steering rudder located under-
neath the main frame. (L. M. p.

LATERAL STABILITY: Three means were
used for securing lateral balance at
Hammondsport: The dihedral angle as
used by Langley, a rudder which “serves
as a vertical aileron” (Zahm affidavit

last two constituted a system ‘identical
in principle with that of Complainant’s
[Wright] combined warping of the
wings and the use of the vertical rud-
der”. (Zahm affidavit p. 6).

LONGITUDINAL STABILITy: At Ham-
mondsport the Penaud inherent longi-
tudinal stability was supplemented with
an elevator system of control.

STEERING: On one day, May 28, 1914,
steering in the horizontal plane was
done with the vertical rudder which
had been substituted for the original
Langley split-vane steering rudder.
After May 28th the steering was done
by the vertical surface of the tail rud-
der (Zahm affidavit p. 7), which in 1903
was immovable about a vertical axis,

Since I became Secretary, in 1928, f have made many efforts to com-

now, speaking for the Smithsonian Institution, make the following
statement in an attempt to correct as far as now possible acts and
assertions of former Smithsonian officials that may have been mis-
leading or are held to be detrimental to the Wrights.

1. I sincerely regret. that the Institution employed to make the
tests of 1914 an agent who had been an unsuccessful defendant in
patent tigation brought against him by the Wrights.

2. Isincerely regret that statements were repeatedly made by officers
of the Institution that the Langley machine was flown in 1914 “with
certain changes of the machine necessary to use pontoons,” without
mentioning the other changes included in Dr. Wright’s list.

3. T point out that Assistant Secretary Rathbun was misinformed
when he stated that the Langley machine “without modification” made
“successful flights.”

4. I sincerely regret the public statement by officers of the Institu-
tion that “The tests” [of 1914] showed “that the late Secretary Langley

had succeeded in building the first aeroplane capable of sustained free
flight with a man.”
118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

5, Leaving to experts to formulate the conclusions arising from the
1914 tests as a whole, in view of all the facts, I repeat in substance, but
with amendments, what I have already published in Smithsonian Sci-
entific Series, Vol. 12, 1932, page 227:

The flights of the Langley aerodrome at Hammondsport in
1914, having been made long after flying had become a common
art, and with changes of the machine indicated by Dr. Wright’s
comparison as given above, did not warrant the statements pub-
lished by the Smithsonian Institution that these tests proved
that the large Langley machine of 1903 was capable of sustained
flight carrying a man.

6. If the publication of this paper should clear the way for Dr.
Wright to bring back to America the Kitty Hawk machine to which
all the world awards first place, it will be a source of profound and
enduring gratification to his countrymen everywhere. Should he
decide to deposit the plane in the United States National Museum,
it would be given the highest place of honor, which is its due.
THE PROBLEM OF THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE?

By EpwIn HUBBLE
Mount Wilson Observatory

I propose to discuss the problem of the expanding universe from the
observational point of view. The fact that such a venture is permis-
sible is emphatic evidence that empirical research has definitely en-
tered the field of cosmology. The exploration of space has swept out-
ward in successive waves, first, through the system of the planets,
then, through the stellar system, and, finally, into the realm of the
nebulae. Today we study a region of space so vast and so homo-
geneous that it may well be a fair sample of the universe. At any
rate, we are justified in adopting the assumption as a working hypothe-
sis and attempting to infer the nature of the universe from the ob-
served characteristics of the sample. One phase of this ambitious
project is the observational test of the current theory of the expanding
universes of general relativity.

I shall briefly describe the observable region of space as revealed
by preliminary reconnaissance with large telescopes, then sketch the
theory in outline, and, finally, discuss the recent more accurate ob-
servations that were designed to clarify and to test the theory.

THE OBSERVABLE REGION

The sun, as you know, is a star, one of several thousand million stars
which together form the stellar system. This system is a great swarm
of stars isolated in space. It drifts through the universe as a swarm
of bees moves through the summer air. From our position near the
sun we look out through the swarm of stars, past the borders, and
into the universe beyond.

Until recently those outer regions lay in the realm of speculation.
Today we explore them with confidence. They are empty for the
most part, vast stretches of empty space. But here and there, sep-
arated by immense intervals, other stellar systems are found, com-
parable with our own. We find them thinly scattered through space

120 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

out as far as telescopes can reach. They are so distant that, in gen-
eral, they appear as small faint clouds mingled among the stars, and
many of them have long been known by the name “nebulae.” Their
identification as great stellar systems, the true inhabitants of the uni-
verse, was a recent achievement of great telescopes.

On photographs made with such instruments, these nebulae, these
stellar systems, appear in many forms. Nevertheless they fall nat-
urally into an ordered sequence ranging from compact globular masses
through flattening ellipsoids into a line of unwinding spirals. The
array exhibits the progressive development of a single basic pattern,
and is known as the sequence of classification. It may represent the
life history of stellar systems. At any rate, it emphasizes the common
features of bodies that belong to a single family.

Consistent with this interpretation is the fact that these stellar
systems, regardless of their structural forms, are all of the same gen-
eral order of intrinsic luminosity; that 1s, of candlepower. They
average about 100 million suns and most of them fall within the
narrow range from one-half to twice this average value. Giants and
dwarfs are known, 10 to 20 times brighter or fainter than the average,
but their numbers appear to be relatively small. This conclusion is
definitely established in the case of giants, which can be readily ob-
served throughout an immense volume of space, but is still speculative
in the case of dwarfs which can be studied only in our immediate
vicinity.

The limited range in luminosity is important because it offers a
convenient measure of distance. As a first approximation, we may
assume that the nebulae are all equally luminous, and, consequently,
that their apparent faintness indicates their distances. The procedure
is not reliable in the case of a single object because the particular
nebula might happen to be a giant or a dwarf rather than a normal
stellar system. But for statistical purposes, where large numbers of
nebulae are involved, the relatively few giants and dwarfs should
average out, and the mean distances of large groups may be accurately
determined. It is by this method that the more remote regions of
space, near the limits of the telescope, may be explored with confidence.

Throughout the observable region the nebulae are found scattered
singly, in pairs, and in groups up to great compact clusters or even
clouds. The small-scale distribution is irregular, and is dominated
by a tendency toward clustering. Yet when larger and larger vol-
umes of space are compared, the minor irregularities tend to average
out, and the samples grow more and more uniform. If the observable
region were divided into a hundred or even a thousand equal parts,
the contents would probably be nearly identical. Therefore, the large-
scale distribution of nebulae is said to be uniform; the observable re-
THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE—HUBBLE 121

gion is homogeneous, very much the same everywhere and in all
directions.

We may now present a rough sketch of our sample of the universe.
The faintest nebulae that can be detected with the largest telescope in
operation (the 100-inch reflector on Mount Wilson) are about 2 mil-
lion times fainter than the faintest star that can be seen with the naked
eye. Since we know the average candlepower of these nebulae, we
can estimate their average distance—500 million light-years. A
sphere with this radius defines the observable region of space.
Throughout the sphere are scattered about 100 million nebulae, at vari-
ous stages of their evolutional development. These nebulae average
about 100 million times brighter than the sun and several thousand
million times more massive. Our own stellar system is a giant nebula,
and is presumably a well-developed, open spiral. The nebulae are
found, as has been said, singly, in groups and in clusters but, on the
grand scale, these local irregularities average out and the observable
region as a whole is approximately homogeneous. The average in-
terval between neighboring nebulae is about 2 million light-years, and
the internebular space is sensibly transparent.

THE LAW OF RED SHIFTS

Another general characteristic of the observable region has been
found in the law of red shifts, sometimes called the velocity-distance
relation. This feature introduces the subject of spectrum analysis.
It is well known that, in general, light from any source is a composite
of many individual colors or wave lengths. When the composite beam
passes through a glass prism or other suitable device, the individual
colors are separated out in an ordered rainbow sequence, known as a
spectrum. The prism bends the hght waves according to the wave
length. The deflections are least for the long waves of the red and
are greatest for the short waves of the violet. Hence position in the
spectrum indicates the wave length of the light falling at any par-
ticular place in the sequence.

Incandescent solids, and certain other sources, radiate light of all
possible wave lengths, and their spectra are continuous. Incandes-
cent gases, however, radiate only certain particular wave lengths, and
their spectra, called emission spectra, consist of various isolated colors
separated by blank spaces. The patterns are well known, hence gases
in a distant light source can be identified by their spectra.

The sun presents a third kind of spectrum, known as an absorption
spectrum. The main body of the sun furnishes a continuous spec-
trum. The heavy atmosphere surrounding the main body is gaseous
and would normally exhibit an emission spectrum. Actually, the at-
mosphere, because it is cooler than the main body, absorbs from the
122 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

continuous background those colors it would otherwise emit. There-
fore the solar spectrum is a continuous spectrum on which is super-
posed a pattern of dark gaps or lines. These dark lines identify the
gases in the solar atmosphere and indicate the physical conditions
under which they exist.

The nebulae are stellar systems, and their spectra resemble that of
the sun. Dark lines due to calcium, hydrogen, iron, and other ele-
ments in the atmospheres of the component stars are identified with
complete confidence. In the case of the nearer nebulae, these lines are
close to their normal positions as determined in the laboratory or in
the sun. In general, however, accurate measures disclose slight dis-
placements, either to the red or to the violet side of the exact normal
positions.

Such small displacements are familiar features in the spectra of
stars and are known to be introduced by rapid motion in the line of
sight. Ifa star is rapidly approaching the observer, the light waves
are crowded together and shortened, and all the spectral lines appear
slightly to the violet side of the normal positions. Conversely, rapid
recession of a star drags out and lengthens the light waves, and the
spectral lines are seen to the red of their normal positions.

The amounts of these displacements (they are called Doppler
shifts) indicate the velocities of the stars in the line of sight. If the
wave lengths are altered by a certain fraction of the normal wave
lengths, the star is moving at a velocity which is that same fraction
of the velocity of light. In this way it has been found that the stars
are drifting about at average speeds of 10 to 30 miles per second,
and, indeed, that the stellar system, our own nebula, is rotating about
its center at the majestic rate of one revolution in perhaps 200 mil-
lion years.

Similarly, the nebulae are found to be drifting about in space at
average speeds of the order of 150 miles per second. Such speeds,
of course, are minute fractions of the velocity of light, and the cor-
responding Doppler shifts, which may be either to the violet or to
the red, are barely perceptible.

But the spectra of distant nebulae show another effect as con-
spicuous as it is remarkable. The dark absorption lines are found
far to the red of their normal positions. Superposed on the small
red or violet shifts representing individual motions, is a systematic
shift to the red which increases directly with the distances of the
nebulae observed. If one nebula is twice as far away as another,
the red shift will be twice as large; if v times as far away, the red
shift will be n times as large. This relation is known as the law of
red shifts; it appears to be quite a general feature of the observable
region of space.
THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE—HUBBLE 123

If these systematic red shifts are interpreted as the familiar Dopp-
ler shifts, it follows that the nebulae are receding from us in all
directions at velocities that increase directly with the momentary
distances. The rate of increase is about 100 miles per second per
million light-years of distance, and the observations have been car-
ried out to nearly 250 million light-years where the red shifts cor-
respond to velocities of recession of nearly 25,000 miles per second
or 4 the velocity of light.

On this interpretation the present distribution of nebulae could
be accounted for by the assumption that all the nebulae were once
jammed together in a very small volume of space. Then, at a certain
instant, some 1,800 million years ago, the jam exploded, the nebulae
rushed outward in all directions with all possible velocities, and they
have maintained these velocities to the present day. Thus the nebu-
lae have now receded to various distances, depending upon their
initial velocities, and our observations necessarily uncover the law
of red shifts.

This pattern of history seems so remarkable that some observers
view it with pardonable reserve, and try to imagine alternative ex-
planations for the law of red shifts. Up to the present, they have
failed. Other ways are known by which red shifts might be pro-
duced, but all of them introduce additional effects that should be
conspicuous and actually are not found. Red shifts represent Doppler
effects, physical recession of the nebulae, or the action of some
hitherto unrecognized principle in nature.

COSMOLOGICAL THEORY

The preliminary sketch of the observable region was completed
about 10 years ago. It was not necessarily a finished picture, but it
furnished a rough framework within which precise, detailed investi-
gations could be planned with a proper understanding of their relation
to the general scheme. Such new investigations, of course, were
guided when practical by current theory. Let me explain the sig-
nificance of this procedure.

Mathematicians deal with possible worlds, with an infinite number
of logically consistent systems. Observers explore the one particular
world we inhabit. Between the two stands the theorist. He studies
possible worlds but only those which are compatible with the infor-
mation furnished by observers. In other words, theory attempts to
segregate the minimum number of possible worlds which must include
the actual world we inhabit. Then the observer, with new factual
information, attempts to reduce the list still further. And so it goes,
observation and theory advancing together toward the common goal
of science, knowledge of the structure and behavior of the physical
universe.
124 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

The relation is evident in the history of cosmology. The study at
first was pure speculation. But the exploration of space moved
outward until finally a vast region, possibly a fair sample of the
universe, was opened for inspection. Then theory was revitalized ;
it now had a sure base from which to venture forth.

Current theory starts with two fundamental principles: general
relativity and the cosmological principle. General relativity states
that the geometry of space is determined by the contents of space, and
formulates the nature of the relation. Crudely put, the principle
states that space is curved in the vicinity of matter, and that the
amount of curvature depends upon the amount of matter. Because
of the irregular distribution of matter in our world, the small-scale
structure of space is highly complex. However, if the universe is
sufficiently homogeneous on the large scale, we may adopt a general
curvature for the universe, or for the observable region as a whole,
just as we speak of the general curvature of the earth’s surface,
disregarding the mountains and ocean basins. The nature of the
spatial curvature, whether it is positive or negative, and the numeri-
cal value, is a subject for empirical investigation.

The second, or cosmological principle is a pure assumption—the
very simple postulate that, on the grand scale, the universe will
appear much the same from whatever position it may be explored.
In other words, there is no favored position in the universe, no
center, no boundaries. If we, on the earth, see the universe expand-
ing in all directions, then any other observer, no matter where he is
located, will also see the universe expanding in the same manner.
The postulate, it may be added, implies that, on the grand scale, the
universe is homogeneous and isotropic—very much the same every-
where and in all directions.

Modern cosmological theory attempts to describe the types of
universes that are compatible with the two principles, general rela-
tivity and the cosmological principle. Profound analysis of the
problem leads to the following conclusions. Such universes are
unstable. They might be momentarily in equilibrium, but the
slightest internal disturbance would destroy the balance, and disturb-
ances must occur. Therefore, these possible worlds are not stationary.
They are, in general, either contracting or expanding, although
theory in its present form does not indicate either the direction of
change or the rate of change. At this point, the theorist turned to
the reports of the observers. The empirical law of red shifts was
accepted as visible evidence that the universe is expanding in a
particular manner and at a known rate. Thus arose the conception
of homogeneous expanding universe of general relativity.

In such universes, the spatial curvature is steadily diminishing as
the expansion progresses. Furthermore, the nature of the expansion
THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE—HUBBLE 125

is such that gravitational assemblages maintain their identities. In
other words, material bodies or groups and clusters of nebulae do not
themselves expand but maintain their permanent dimensions as their
neighbors recede from them in all directions.

Several types of expanding universes are possible, and some of
them can be further specified by the nature of the curvature, whether
it is positive or negative. In fact, the particular universe we inhabit
could be identified if we had sufficiently precise information on three
measurable quantities, namely, the rate of expansion, the mean
density of matter in space, and the spatial curvature at the present
epoch. Recent empirical investigations have been directed toward
these problems, and the results will be briefly described in the remain-
ing section of this discussion.

COMPARISON OF THEORY AND OBSERVATIONS

We may begin with two results which are thoroughly consistent
with the theory. The first result concerns the assumption of homo-
geneity ; the second, the conclusion that groups maintain their dimen-
sions as the universe expands.

The distribution of nebulae has been studied in two ways. ‘The first
information came from sampling surveys at Mount Wilson and at the
Lick Observatory. Small areas, systematically scattered over the sky,
were studied with large telescopes. Thus the nebulae that were
counted lay in narrow cones penetrating to vast distances. These
surveys established large-scale homogeneity over the three-quarters of
the sky that could be studied from the northern latitudes of the ob-
servatories involved.

Later, the Harvard College Observatory, with the help of its south-
ern station, has furnished counts of the nebulae extending over large
areas but made with moderate-size telescopes. In other words, these
nebulae are scattered through wide cones penetrating to moderate dis-
tances. Shapley, in his reports, has stressed or perhaps overstressed,
the familiar, small-scale irregularities of distribution, but analysis of
such published data as are adequately calibrated agrees with the earlier
conclusion. In fact, the mean results from the two quite different
methods of study are sensibly the same. This fact reemphasizes the
large-scale homogeneity of the observable region.

The second result is derived from a study of the Local Group. Our
own stellar system is one of a dozen nebulae that form a loose group,
more or less isolated in the general field. These neighboring systems
furnished the first clues to the nature of the nebulae and the scale of
internebular distances. They are so near that their brightest stars
could be recognized and compared with similar stars in our own sys-
tem. Radial velocities of the members of the Local Group, listed in
126 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

table 1, suggest that the law of red shifts probably does not operate
within the group. This conclusion is positive evidence supporting the
validity of the theory. If the universe is expanding, the group main-
tains its dimensions as the theory requires.

The remainder of the recently accumulated information is not favor-
able to the theory. It is so damaging, in fact, that the theory, in
its present form, can be saved only by assuming that the observational
results include hidden systematic errors. The latter possibility will
naturally persist until the investigations can be repeated and improved.
Nevertheless, a careful reexamination of the data now available sug-
gests no adequate explanation of the discrepancies.

TABLE 2.—Radial velocities in the Local Group

The observed velocities (second column) represent a more reasonable distri-
bution than the velocities corrected for red shifts (fifth column). The latter
are all large and negative with the exception of the first two, for which the red
shifts are insignificant. This fact suggests that the law of red shifts does not
operate within the Local Group.

THE INTERPRETATION OF RED SHIFTS

The investigations were designed to determine whether or not red
shifts represent actual recession. In principle, the problem can be
solved; a rapidly receding light source appears fainter than a simi-
lar but stationary source at the same momentary distance. The ex-
planation of this well-known effect is quite simple when the beam
of light is pictured as a stream of discrete quanta. Rapid recession
thins out the stream of quanta, hence fewer quanta reach the eye
per second, and the intensity, or rate of impact, is necessarily re-
THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE—HUBBLE Tag

duced. Quantitatively, the normal brightness is reduced by a frac-
tion that is merely the velocity of recession divided by the velocity
of light—in other words, the red shift expressed as a fraction of
the normal wave lengths of the light in question. Recession at one-
tenth the velocity of light reduces the apparent brightness by 10
percent; at one-quarter the velocity of light, by 25 percent.

For velocities of a few miles or a few hundred miles per second,
the dimming factor is negligible. But for the extremely distant
nebulae, where the apparent recessions reach tens of thousands of
miles per second, the effects are large enough to be readily observed
and measured. Hence, if the distances of nebulae were known quite
accurately we could measure their apparent faintness and tell at
once whether or not they are receding at the rates indicated by the
red shifts.

Unfortunately, the problem is not so simple. The only general
criterion of great distance is the very apparent faintness of the
nebulae which we wish to test. Therefore, the proposed test in-
volves a vicious circle, and the dimming factor merely leads to an
error in distance. However, a possible escape from the vicious circle
is found in the following procedure. Since the intrinsic luminosi-
ties of nebulae are known, their apparent faintness furnishes two
scales of distances, depending upon whether we assume the nebulae
to be stationary or receding. If, then, we analyze our data, if we
map the observable region, using first one scale and then the other,
we may find that the wrong scale leads to contradictions or at least
to grave difficulties. Such attempts have been made and one scale
does lead to trouble. It is the scale which includes the dimming
factors of recession, which assumes that the universe is expanding.

ALTERNATIVE FORMS OF THE LAW OF RED SHIFTS

The project was carried out by the precise formulation of (a) the
law of red shifts, and (b) the large-scale distribution of nebulae.
The form of the law of red shifts is most readily derived from the
study of the brightest nebulae in the great clusters. These nebulae,
as a class, are the most luminous bodies in the universe, and their
spectra can be recorded out to the maximum distances. Further-
more, the clusters are so similar that the apparent faintness of the
5 or 10 brightest members furnish reliable relative distances. The
observations now extend out to about 240 million light-years where
the red shift is about 13 percent of the normal wave lengths of the
incoming light. Since the corresponding velocity of recession is the
same fraction of the velocity of light, the nebulae in the most distant
cluster observed, if they are actually receding, will appear 13 percent
fainter than they would appear if they were stationary. The dif-
128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

ference is small but, fortunately, the measures can be made with fair
accuracy.

The results may be stated simply. If the nebulae are stationary,
the law of red shifts is sensibly linear; red shifts are a constant
multiple of distances. In other words, each unit of light path con-
tributes the same amount of red shift.

I'igurE I.—The law of red shifts. The law of red shifts at very great distances
is derived as a relation between apparent magnitudes of the fifth brightest
members of clusters and the mean red shifts observed in the clusters. The
relation, log d\/A = 0.2 ms + constant, shown as a full line in the diagram,
indicates a linear law of red shifts (d\/A=constant X distance).

In the diagram, large disks represent clusters of high weight; dots, clusters
of low weight; crosses, weighted means. Observed magnitudes have been
corrected for all known effects (including the “energy effects,” 3d\/A), except
recession factors. Thus, for a stationary universe, the law of red shifts is
sensibly linear.

For an expanding universe, the recession factors would be applied, and the
law would depart from the linear form. Such departures, shown by the
broken curve, imply that the rate of expansion has been slowing down, and
that the “age of the universe,” the time since the expansion started, is less
than 1,000 million years.

The diagram includes minor revisions of the observational data in acecord-
ance with recent investigations.

represented by (log N,,—0.6m). Each point in the diagram represents a survey
in which the observed m have been corrected for all known effects (including
the “energy effects,” 3 d\/\) but omitting the “recession factors,’ dA/A. The
diagram indicates that for a stationary universe, the density is independent of
distance (or red shift).

If the universe were expanding, “recession factors” should be applied, and the
points would fall along the broken line, indicating that the density increases
steadily with distance. In order to escape this conclusion, it is necessary to
introduce still another effect such as spatial curvature which exactly com-
pensates the recession factors.

The dots represent surveys mace at Mount Wilson and Mount Hamilton; the
first cross, the Shapley-Ames survey to m=13+; the second cross, Harvard
counts to m=17.5, extracted from Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci., vol. 24, p. 148, 1988,
and vol. 26, pp. 166 and 554, 1940, and reduced according to the procedure
used in reducing the deeper surveys.

On the other hand, if the nebulae are receding, and the dimming
factors are applied, the scale of distances is altered, and the law
of red shifts is no longer linear. The rate of expansion increases more
and more rapidly with distance. The significance of this result
becomes clear when the picture is reversed. Light that reaches us
today left the distant nebulae far back in the dim past—hundreds of
millions of years ago. When we say that the rate of expansion
increases with distance, we are saying that long ago, the universe was
expanding much faster than it is today; that, for the last several
hundred million years at least, the rate of expansion has been slowing
down. Therefore, the so-called “age of the universe,” the time inter-
130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

val since the expansion began, is much shorter than the 1,800 million
years suggested by a linear law of red shifts. If the measures are
reliable, the interval would be less than 1,000 million years—a fraction
of the age of the earth and comparable with the history of life on
the earth. The nature of the expansion is permissible and, in fact,
specifies certain types of possible worlds. But the time scale is
probably not acceptable. Either the measures are unreliable or red
shifts do not represent expansion of the universe,

THE LARGE-SCALE DISTRIBUTION OF NEBULAE

If the new formulation of the law of red shifts were unsupported
by other evidence, the implications would probably be disregarded.
But similar discrepancies are met in quite independent studies of
large-scale distribution. Five sampling surveys (four at Mount Wil-
son and one at Mount Hamilton) made with large reflectors, furnish
the numbers of nebulae per unit area in the sky, to successive limits
of apparent faintness. The results furnish the numbers of nebulae
per unit volume in five spheres whose radii range from about 155 to
420 million light-years on the stationary distance scale, or about 145
to 865 million light-years for the expanding distance scale.

On the assumption that red shifts do not represent actual recession,
the large-scale distribution is sensibly homogeneous—the average
number of nebulae per unit volume of space is much the same for each
of the spheres. Further confirmation is found in some of the recent
Harvard counts of nebulae which fall within the area of the sky cov-
ered by the deep surveys, and which are based on the same scale of
apparent faintness. Sufficient data can be extracted from the reports
to determine a mean density over large areas extending out to perhaps
100 million light-years, and the result is in substantial agreement
with those of the earlier investigations. All of these data lead to the
very simple conception of a sensibly infinite, homogeneous universe of
which the observable region is an insignificant sample.

The inclusion of dimming corrections for recession, because they
alter the scale of distance in a nonlinear way, necessarily destroys the
homogeneity. The number of nebulae per unit volume now appears
to increase systematically with distance in all directions. The result
violates the cosmological principle of no favored position and, con-
sequently, is referred to some neglected factor in the calculations. If
the density appeared to diminish outward, we would at once suspect
the presence of internebular obscuration, or, perhaps, the existence of
a supersystem of nebulae. But an apparently increasing density offers
a much more serious problem. About the only known, permissible
interpretation is found in positive spatial curvature, which, by a sort
of optical foreshortening, would crowd the observed nebulae into
THE EXPANDING UNIVERSE—HUBBLE 131

apparently smaller and smaller volumes of space as the distance
increased.

Spatial curvature is an expected feature of an expanding universe,
and, together with the precise form of the law of red shifts, further
specifies a particular type of possible world. Thus, if the measures
were reliable, we might conclude that the initial cosmological problem
had been solved; that now we knew the nature of the universe we
inhabit. But the situation is not so simple. Just as the departures
from linearity in the law of red shifts indicate a universe that is
strangely young, so the apparent departures from homogeneity indi-
cate a universe that is strangely small and dense.

The sign of the curvature required to restore homogeneity is posi-
tive, hence the universe is “closed”; it has a finite volume although,
of course, there are no boundaries. The amount of curvature indicates
the volume of the universe: about four times the volume of the observ-
able region. Such a universe would contain perhaps 400 million
nebulae. The total mass, however, would be far greater than that
which can be attributed to the nebulae alone.

CONCLUSION

Thus the use of dimming corrections leads to a particular kind of
universe, but one which most students are likely to reject as highly
improbable. Furthermore, the strange features of this universe are
merely the dimming corrections expressed in different terms. Omit
the dimming factors, and the oddities vanish. We are left with the
simple, even familiar, concept of a sensibly infinite universe. All the
difficulties are transferred to the interpretation of red shifts which
cannot then be the familiar velocity shifts.

Two further points may be mentioned. In the first place, the
reference of red shifts to some hitherto unknown principle does not
in any way destroy the validity of the theory of expanding universes.
It merely removes the theory from immediate contact with observa-
tions. We may still suppose that the universe is either expanding or
contracting, but at a rate so slow that it cannot now be disentangled
from the gross effects of the superposed red shifts.

Secondly, the conclusions drawn from the empirical investigations
involve the assumptions that the measures are reliable and the data
are representative. These questions have been carefully reexamined
during the past few years. Various minor revisions have been made,
but the end results remain substantially unchanged. By the usual
criteria of probable errors, the data seem to be sufficiently consistent
for their purpose. Nevertheless, the operations are delicate, and the
most significant data are found near the limits of the greatest tele-

501591—43 10

132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

scopes. Under such conditions, it is always possible that the re-
sults may be affected by hidden systematic errors. Although no
suggestion of such errors has been found, the possibility will persist
until the investigations can be repeated with improved techniques and
more powerful telescopes. Ultimately, the problem should be settled
beyond question by the 200-inch reflector destined for Palomar. The
range of that telescope, and the corresponding ranges of the dimming
corrections, should be about twice those examined in the present in-
vestigations. Factors of 25 percent in the apparent brightness of
nebulae at the limits of the spectrograph, and 40 to 50 percent at the
limits of direct photography should be unmistakable if they really
exist.

Meanwhile, on the basis of the evidence now available, apparent
discrepancies between theory and observation must be recognized.
A choice is presented, as once before in the days of Copernicus, be-
tween a strangely small, finite universe and a sensibly infinite uni-
verse plus a new principle of nature.

Like the galaxies themselves, the field of inquiry concerning
galaxies is large and not easily surveyed in a brief article. It will
be well to restrict the assignment and write only concerning a few
selected topics.

Let us first try a bird’s-eye view of our own galaxy. The bird
whose eye we would use needs to be a remarkable creature to reach
the remoteness necessary for an outside look. We cannot use
Cygnus the Swan, that heads in full flight along the northern Milky
Way, nor Aquila the Eagle, nor the big-billed Toucan, the Flamingo,
the Phoenix, the Goose, the Bird of Paradise, nor Corvus the Crow.
All these constellation birds are composed of stars that are bright
neighbors of the sun and distinctly localized far inside our own
galaxy.

What we need is an observation point something lke a million
light-years distant, well outside the bounds of the enormous Milky
Way system. It would be pretty satisfactory to settle our bird com-
fortably in the outer haze of stars of the Andromeda nebula. If the
observer be a contemporary of ours, he will be looking at our system
in terms of 8,000 centuries ago. It has been that long since the radia-
tion left the sun and its neighboring stars on its way to the retina
of the all-comprehending but quite imaginary bird now surveying
us from the Andromeda galaxy.

Such a temporal disparity, 8X10° years, is of no particular
moment in our considerations of the galaxies; and short-term enter-
prises like the current western civilization, or even the whole history
of mankind, can be neglected in the cosmic panorama as too momen-
tary, too fleeting, for a clear recording.

It is well known that the Milky Way star system is a much
flattened organization and that the sun and planets are well inside.

This interpretation of the Milky Way was pointed out 190 years ago
by Thomas Wright, a pioneer “bird’s-eye viewer” of Durham,
England. He saw that the hypothesis of a flattened stellar system
with the earth near the central plane would satisfactorily explain
the Milky Way band as a phenomenon of projection in such a
system.2 Our hypothetical observer in Andromeda would see this
flattened wheel-shaped system not from the direction of its rim, nor
from the direction of its axis, but from an intermediate position,
galactic latitude —21°. It would appear in projection, therefore, as
an elongated object, perhaps with the axes of the rough ellipse in
the ratio of about three to one. There would be a conspicuous
globular nucleus of naked-eye brightness.

We are almost certain now that our galaxy is a great openwork
spiral system of stars, perhaps not much unlike the system Messier 83,
shown in plate 1. But in linear measure it may be much larger than
Messier 88. It has taken a long time to get conclusive evidence on the
structure of our own system. We are badly located. There are ob-
vious difficulties with residing inside. The meadow violet, no matter
how bold and sensitive, is at a disadvantage in meadow topography
compared with the bird hovering above.

For more than a hundred years astronomers have struggled with
the problems of the structure of the galaxy. There have been many
speculators, but also some hard and systematic observers. Sir William
Herschel dominated this field throughout the early part of the nine-
teenth century. His surveys of star clusters and nebulae, his measures
of brightness and positions of various celestial objects, his interpreta-
tions of the accumulating material were so important that he is
appropriately considered the founder of sidereal astronomy. Before
him the emphasis was on comets and planets and the positions and
motions of nearby stars and the laws governing these motions. It was
essentially solar-system astronomy that attracted the telescopes and
the wisdom of scientists until this German-Anglican organist of Bath
devised some instruments; then astronomy turned outward to inter-
stellar spaces.

Sir William Herschel was considerably bafiled by the problem of
the structure of the galaxy and by the relation of clusters and nebulae
to the Milky Way. His successors made many notable contributions,
photometric and spectroscopic, to knowledge of the nature of stars
and nebulae, but still the large cosmic problems remained baffling.
Increasing telescopic strength, however, and the accumulation of many
kinds and types of observations, eventaully led to less puzzlement about

Kant, see the highly interesting report by F. A. Paneth, The Observatory, pp. 71ff., June

the stellar neighbors of the sun and the nearer parts of the Milky Way.
The old but unproved concept that the spiral nebulae and their rela-
tives were external galaxies, coordinate with our own Milkey Way
system, gradually became established. The dimensions of the galaxy
and of the universe approached clarification, chiefly through the power
of the telescopes of American observatories and the vision of European
and American theoreticians.

In clarifying some of the earlier puzzles, however, the astronomers
only succeeded in opening vaster vistas for exploration, interpretation,
and wonderment. The net gain has been considerable. It is no longer
believed that the severe difficulties of certain astronomical enterprises
have definitely blocked the progress of inquiry. A hundred years ago
a distinguished scientist (not an astronomer) gloated a bit over the
pronouncement that one thing would certainly forever remain un-
known, namely, the chemical nature of the stars! It was not many
years before the spectroscope began to betray him. And at the time
of her death in 1941 Dr. Annie Cannon had classified more than half
a million stars on the basis of the chemistry of their surfaces. A
great deal is now known of the chemical constitution of a galaxy of
a billion stars at a distance of 10 million light-years. An elementary
astronomical student can quickly learn, with the use of modern equip-
ment, about the hydrogen, calcium, iron, magnesium, helium, carbon,
and the like in stars that have never actually been seen except through
use of the photographic plate.

The moral of that bad ancient pronouncement about stellar chem-
istry is that it is not wise to be discouraged with the difficulties arising
from our awkward location in the galaxy. Eventually all the answers
to all the questions you could now ask about Milky Way structure may
be known. And, of course, we would then be wise enough to ask other
questions that you could not answer, nor could we. Here are some of
the current questions, and, for some of them, preliminary answers.

1. Are the sun and its planets in the middle of our discoidal galaxy?
They certainly are not. There are many lines of evidence which indi-
cate that the center is far away in the direction of the region where the
constellations of Sagittarius, Ophiuchus, and Scorpio come together,
30 degrees or a little more south of the celestial equator in the thick of
the bright star clouds along the Milky Way. My early study of the
globular star clusters (a reproduction of an important one, 47 Tucanae,
is shown in pl. 2) was instrumental in showing the observer that he
is well out toward the rim of the whecl-shaped galaxy. There may be
some “subcenters” in other parts of the Milky Way, in far south Carina,
for instance, and in Cygnus. But those conglomerations of stars ap-
pear to be important local structures within the great galaxy that has
its massive nucleus in the Sagittarius direction.
136 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

2. Is this galaxy in motion asa unit? How it moves with respect to
nearby galaxies is not yet very clear, but certainly it rotates around
the Sagittarius nucleus. It does not rotate as a solid wheel, at least
at our distance from the nucleus. It rotates more as the planetary sys-
tem rotates; the planets nearer the sun go more rapidly and complete
their “years” in shorter times than the remoter planets. We think we
can very definitely measure the differential speed of stars around the
nucleus. The average speed in the sun’s neighborhood is about 200
miles a second, and the direction of motion is toward the northern con-
stellation of Cygnus.

3. How far are the sun and the neighboring stars from the axis of
rotation? Ten kiloparsecs is the approximate answer and, since a
parsec is 3.26 light-years or about 20 trillion miles, the distance is
something like 2X10" miles, or 30-odd thousand light-years. For
various reasons, that value of 10 kiloparsecs is not too certain, but it is
well established that the center of gravity of our system is between
8 and 12 kiloparsecs distant. The direction to the center is fixed with
an uncertainty of only 2 or 3 degrees; this angular parameter is much
easier to handle than the distance.

4, How large is the Milky Way system and how populous? Enorm-
ous in size and population, if nonquantitative terms may be used.
There is good evidence that the total population in stars is of the order
of 200,000 million, but the evidence on over-all dimensions is as yet
inconclusive. Indeed it is somewhat involved with definitions. For
instance, how define the boundary of a galaxy? Is it at the distance
of the farthermost discoverable member of the system? Or is it the
distance to the place where the number of stars per cubic hght-year has
decreased to a specified small quantity? Or is it, for a spiral galaxy,
the distance to which a spiral arm can be traced? Or is it the distance
to which an escaping star can go before the’gravitational holdback 1 is
exceeded by the pull from some Toihen oleae

The diameter of the system in its plane is not less than 100,000
light-years if all its recognizable stars are included. There is now
good evidence that the wheel-shaped system is surrounded by a more
or less spherical haze of stars, and some of the stars in the haze are
50,000 light-years above the plane of the Milky Way. Probably this
haze extends more distantly in the plane of the system and, therefore,
the diameter of discoid plus haze considerably exceeds 100,000 light-
years.

On the other hand, the diameter of our system in its plane might be
measured as only 50,000 light-years, or even less, if we had to depend
on photographic research equipment which, although comparable
with our own, was located in the Virgo supergalaxy, several million
light-years away. Our outer stars might not register. When our tele-
scopes are turned on the members of that group in Virgo we can trace
GALAXIES —SHAPLEY sare

on the best of our long-exposure plates the largest individual galaxies
only to a distance of 10 or 15 thousand light-years from their centers.
Either those systems are very much smaller than ours, or we are unable
to explore the faint regions that are as remote from the nuclei as we
are from our nucleus in Sagittarius.

It might turn out, therefore, that the bird’s-eye observer from the
Andromeda nebula would report that our galactic system is no larger
than the Andromeda nebula; or, if the research were rather casual, the
view might include only the nuclear portions of our galactic system,
which might even be cataloged as a spheroidal galaxy. When we, in
our turn, take a quick bird’s-eye view of the Andromeda galaxy, and
measure its distance and dimensions, we immediately conclude that it
is much smaller than we are, even though it is a giant compared with
the average galaxy of our catalogs. But when the over-all extent of
the Andromeda galaxy is studied with precise measuring apparatus,
we double the dimensions as first seen and conclude that it is not very
much smaller than the Milky Way system.

5. Why is it that we seem to be so baffled about the structure and
dimensions of our own system, although we bravely go out to dis-
tances of 100 million light-years in our explorations of other galaxies?
What is so troublesome about measuring something that completely
surrounds us and is near at hand?

That question finally brings out one feature of Milky Way structure
which must be clearly seen at first glance by the observer in Andro-
meda, but which has taken us many years and much labor to discover
and partially evaluate. This basic feature (and difficulty) is the pres-
ence throughout the Milky Way, especially near the Milky Way plane,
of interstellar absorbing material—dust and gas, scattered and in
clouds, around the stars and in the spaces between them. Our vision
is not clear; simple geometric relations between light and distance are
incorrect because our observing station is in a fog that unevenly dims
the light of the surrounding stars.

Gradually we are learning through studies of colors, and otherwise,
how to make corrections for the interstellar absorption. It would not
be difficult at all if the absorbing material were uniform. But the
clouds of absorption are irregular. It is supposed that some of the
greatest irregularities would be apparent to the Andromedan observer.
At any rate, our own bird’s-eye views of hundreds of external galaxies
show immediately the dark lanes between spiral arms, or across them,
which indicate the interstellar absorption clouds that irregularly dim
the star fields of those distant stellar systems.

In summary, our imaginary bird’s-eye view has revealed our system
as discoidal in its main body of stars, probably surrounded by a thinly
populated spheroidal shell and dominated by a massive globular nu-
138 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

cleus, which is some 30,000 light-years from the sun in an accurately
measurable direction. Less certainly the view discloses that the Milky
Way system is a spiral, perhaps more open in structure than the An-
dromeda galaxy; it is rotating at high speed, but, even so, 2 million
centuries or possibly more will be required for the sun and its neigh-
bors to complete one circuit, to click off one cosmic year. Uncertainty
remains as to over-all dimensions of the discoidal galaxy and of its
stellar haze, and this uncertainty arises in part from the existence of
light-absorbing, mostly nonluminous, interstellar material and from
its irregular distribution and its dissimilar effectiveness on light at
various wave lengths.

If, for a more distant view of this part of the universe we go off into
space several million light-years in a special direction, the Andromeda
nebula and our galactic system would look like a pair of galaxies, sepa-
rated by only a few diameters. And in the same field, apparently also
a part of our local group of galaxies, would be the great spiral, Mes-
sier 88. A closer inspection from this distant point, and a careful
measurement of distances, would show several fainter galaxies associ-
ated with these three large systems. Two of them would be the faint
companions of the Andromeda nebula—Messier 32 and NGC 205; two
of them would be our own satellite-companions, the Large and Small
Clouds of Magellan. And there would be at least four other dwarf
galaxies, two of them irregular in form, and two or more spheroidal.

The existence of this local cloud of galaxies, in which our system
appears to be the big dominating member, seems to be now beyond
question, but the census of its membership is not complete. All the
known members are within a sphere of a million light-years diameter.
Those unknown, or of uncertain membership, include systems wholly
or partly concealed by the clouds of absorption near the Milky Way
plane. The rating of the great globular clusters is also not yet clear.
A hundred globular clusters surround our galaxy, apparently subordi-
nate members of the system, but the larger ones, like Omega Centauri
and 47 Tucanae, should perhaps be ranked with the dwarf galaxies.
In total luminosity and in mass they are comparable to NGC 205, the
faint spheroidal galaxy in the Andromeda group. Our hypothetical
Andromedan observer would probably record at least these two giant
clusters as dwarf galaxies, if our own procedure with regard to classi-
fying NGC 205 were followed.

Groups like the local “supergalaxy” occur elsewhere in metagalactic
space. A dozen rich clusters are known, some of them with hundreds
of members, and a score or two of small groups, similar to our own,
are already on record. One such is a group of objects in Fornax, in
which the brightest are spheroidal; in our group the brightest galaxies
are spiral or irregular in form.
GALAXIES—SHAPLEY 139

Probably there are dwarf galaxies in the Fornax group, but as yet
we have not identified them, nor have we found the Magellanic type.
Because of the general tendency of the universe to expand and the
galaxies and groups of galaxies to recede from one another, it may be
that eventually we shall be able to say which faint objects in Fornax
are members of the supersystem simply by determining their velocities
in the line of sight. If the suspected galaxy is really much more dis-
tant than the average of the Fornax group, it will show a bigger “red
shift” in the spectrum, a greater velocity of recession, and thus indicate
the larger distance and the nonmembership.

On every expedition into remote corners of extragalactic space, it
is necessary to equip ourselves with information on giant and super-
giant stars. The reason is, obviously, that ordinary stars in far-off
places are not recorded on our photographs; they are too dim. We
must work with the giants. It may be of interest to consider the fol-
lowing highly luminous stars and types of stars and see how they
contribute to knowledge of the metagalaxy:

1. Supernovae

2. S Doradus

3. Novae

4, P-Cygni stars and others

1. Supernovae—‘The most energetic catastrophe in the history of
the world, unless it be creation itself,” is how I would describe the
great violence of radiation and motion that accompanies the career of
the supernova. Simply defined, a supernova results when a star blows
up. Whether the disaster is caused or encouraged by head-on collision
with another star or another something, or by the collapse of the star’s
structure, with the consequent atomic transformation of mass into
radiation, or “just happens,” we cannot yet say. More observationa
data are needed and are being obtained. The result of a supernova
outburst is the outpouring of light in unparalleled fashion—a spurt
of radiation the equivalent at times of 50 million suns and more. The
burst of radiation lasts sometimes several days or weeks, quieting down
slowly as the months go by. What remains after the flare-up? Per-
haps a dense subdwarf star (the collapsed core of the original star) ;
perhaps a hurriedly expanding nebula; perhaps just dust and ashes, and
the universe filling up with the dying glow of a radiant moment.

Dr. Fritz Zwicky of the California Institute of Technology has
been the leader in recent years in the discovery of supernovae and in
speculations concerning them. He thinks that neutrons and neutrinos
play an important part in the supernova phenomenon. Certainly su-
pernovae play a significant part in the history of the universe. They
are not too uncommon. About 40 are on record, most of them dis-
covered in the past 10 years. Three of them appeared long ago in our
140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

own galactic system. One hypothesis of the origin of the cosmic rays
ties them up with the violence of the supernova.

The most distant individual stars yet photographed are some of the
supernovae that are in galaxies tens of millions of light-years distant.
When more complete records are obtained we shall be able to see if,
at maximum brightness, they are sufficiently alike so that their appar-
ent magnitudes at maximum can be used as a practical criterion of
distance. At present there seems to be too large a dispersion in the
intrinsic luminosities to make supernovae useful criteria in distance
measurement in the metagalaxy.

Long before supernovae were recognized, and long before there was
the faintest notion of their enormous size as celestial phenomena, they
played a very important part in astronomical development and in
knowledge of the universe. For it happens that new stars suddenly
appearing in 1572 and 1604 were important in the inspiration of two
of the great astronomers of that time and of all time—Tycho Brahe,
the Dane, and Johannes Kepler. Now we know that these stellar out-
bursts in Cassiopeia (Tycho’s star) and in Ophiuchus (Kepler’s stella
nova) were most probably supernovae. Both stars rose to a brightness
comparable with that of the brightest planet; both stars changed ex-
plosively 15 magnitudes or more, an increase of brightness of more
than a million times.

A third supernova of our galactic system was recorded by the Japa-
nese and Chinese astronomers in 1054. The phenomenon was the
parent of the present well-known Crab nebula which is still rapidly
expanding as a result of the eleventh-century disaster—eleventh cen-
tury in our records, but 5,000 years earlier on the cosmic clock.

2. The supergiant S Doradus——The distinction of holding top place
as a luminous star has been the lot of an object at the edge of one
of the open clusters in the Large Magellanic Cloud. It is a variable
star with average luminosity half a million times that of the sun.
It is somewhat exceeded in radiation output by supernovae, but they
do not last, whereas S Doradus has been continuously radiating for
the past half century, pouring out more than 100 trillion tons of light
per minute. It must have enormous resources to persist at such high
luminosity. Is it perhaps some very slow type of supernova? The
variations we now observe are irregular in character, but of no great
moment in alleviating the expenditure of radiant energy. The spec-
trum of the star is of the rare P-Cygni type, which is indicative of
unusually hot surface conditions. The Harvard photographic records
of this star do not extend much before 1890, but of course there is
little reason to suspect that S Doradus has been the supreme super-
giant for only the past brief 50 years. Recent photographs with the
large southern reflector have shown that stars nearly as bright as
GALAXIES—SHAPLEY 141

S Doradus are clustered around it, but unfortunately all of them
are difficult to study because, notwithstanding their great intrinsic
luminosities, the intervening distance of 75,000 light-years dims the
light so that even large telescopes can with difficulty make detailed
analyses. None of the stars in the solar neighborhood is one-tenth
as bright as S Doradus.

3. Ordinary novae.—Several times a year, if we pay close attention,
we find new stars in our own galactic system, especially in the direc-
tion toward the galactic center in Sagittarius. But daylight, clouds,
moonlight, and astronomical inactivity contribute to our failure to
record more than a few percent of those that we know, from sampling,
must be occurring. These new stars, or ordinary novae, behave much
like the supernovae described above. But the nova phenomenon is
much less violent, and a star is not sacrificed by each outburst. It is
likely that the ordinary nova represents the explosive instability of
the outer surfaces of a star. There is some indication that before
explosion the ordinary novae are slightly subnormal stars of ordinary
type. Perhaps this subnormality is at the bottom of the trigger action
that sets them off.

But whatever the cause of the novae, it must be recorded as an
interesting phenomenon, and one that probably is important in the
general history of stars. In our own galaxy, and in the neighboring
Andromeda galaxy, these novaé appear so frequently that when one
thinks back over the past billion years that the earth’s crust has
existed, one concludes that very many stars have blown up—a large
proportion of them. Frequently we have remarked that novation is
so common and time has been so long that every star might have
blown up once, or will explode during the next billion years—in other
words, that evolution, or development, by way of the nova outburst
is a major and not a negligible phenomenon in this world.

Evidence is accruing, however, that novation is a recurrent phenom-
enon. Four or five stars have been novae more than once, and two of
them three times since 1860. If this be the true situation—that is,
only stars of peculiar character become novae—we may remain even
more at ease with respect to the immediate future of our sun. Its
character is good and normal. We like to believe that the sun is
and always will be only slightly variable (in the sunspot period), and
will remain quite dependable, undisturbed by interstellar clouds,
unsusceptible to nova-inciting disturbance—at least for the next
thousand years while the astronomers are finding out about the uni-
verse. A nova-like change in the sun would promptly wipe biology
off the earth, if it did not erase the planet altogether.

At maximum the ordinary novae are supergiant stars, more than
10,000 times the luminosity of the sun, but scarcely 1 percent as radiant
as the average supernova. When novae appear in external galaxies

142 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

they can be used as distance indicators because at maximum brightness
the ordinary nova comes to about the same candlepower every time.
Comparing the apparent brightness with the real brightness, the dis-
tance in light-years can readily be computed. Next to the Cepheid
variables, novae are the best criteria for measuring distances of gal-
axies, providing there are enough found in any given system to stabil-
ize the statistics.

4, Some other supergiants.—Two or three magnitudes fainter than
the notable S Doradus in the Large Magellanic Cloud are a number
of others of the same peculiar spectrum, which are termed the P-Cygni
type. There is evidence, not quite conclusive, that these stars are re-
lated to the novae, differing most conspicuously, of course, in the
property of remaining at high luminosities and not fading away after
the impulsive outburst. But in addition to these bluish hot stars we
find in the Magellanic Clouds supergiant red stars, almost as bright.
Some of them are variable, and some are, indeed, long-period Cepheid
variables, 10,000 times as bright as the sun. Many resemble the
famous red giants of our neighborhood, Antares and Betelgeuse. A
few greatly exceed the local red supergiants in volume as well as in
radiation output. Diameters of the order of the radius of Jupiter’s
orbit, volumes 10 million times that of the sun, are indicated. These
preposterous dimensions are derived by knowing the distance of the
Magellanic Cloud, the total candlepowers of these supergiant stars,
and the spectra which indicate low efficiency as radiators. In order
to give out so much radiation, the emitting surfaces must be exceed-
ingly large. The star S Doradus, on the other hand, which is a more
efficient radiator, is much smaller and denser than the Antares-like
supergiants.

Adjacent to the Small Magellanic Cloud is the great globular clus-
ter, 47 Tucanae, already mentioned as an intermediate between normal
galaxies and normal star clusters. Its three brightest stars appear to
be typical long-period variable stars, but they are not typical in one
respect. Their luminosities at maximum are three or four magnitudes
brighter than most long-period variable stars, which are typified by
Mira (The Wonderful) Ceti, the first of known variables. It is pecu-
har, too, that the three supergiant variables in the cluster rise to
almost exactly the same magnitude at maximum, and all have periods
of about 200 days. This is one of the coincidences that the laws of
chance do not easily condone; there must be some deep significance for
stars or star clusters in the unusual performance of these supergiants.

Both blue and red supergiants appear sporadically in our own ga-
lactic system; probably the occasionally detectable highly luminous
stars in external galaxies also belong to various spectral classes. Dr.
Hubble has effectively used the luminosities of these invariable stars,
GALAXIES—-SHAPLEY 143

along with the available information on Cepheid variables and ordi-
nary novae, to get the distances of galaxies that are not more than a
few million light-years away. If a galaxy is as much as 20 million
light-years distant, even these supergiants cannot be individually
photographed with present telescopic and photographic equipment,
and resort must be made to other photometric means of estimating dis-
tances. Ordinary giant stars, like Vega and Arcturus, are not yet
photographed in any but the very nearest galaxies, and stars of aver-
age mass and luminosity, like the sun, have so far not been photo-
graphed outside our own galactic system.

The future of research on galaxies probably depends not so much
on the size of telescopes as on the speed and resolution of photographic
plates and on other radiation-registering devices. But even without
better facilities than those at present available, astronomers have
plenty to do in galactic research, for within reach are 1,000 million in-
dividual stars in our own galaxy, and at least 10 million other galaxies.

IS THE LIFE ON THE OTHER WORLDS??

By Sir JAMES JEANS, O. M., D. Se., LL. D., F. R. S., M. R. I.
Professor of Astronomy
Royal Institution of Great Britain

So long as the earth was believed to be the center of the universe
the question of life on other worlds could hardly arise; there were no
other worlds in the astronomical sense, although a heaven above and
a hell beneath might form adjuncts to this world. The cosmology of
the “Divina Commedia” is typical of its period. In 1440 we find
Nicholas of Cusa comparing our earth, as Pythagoras had done before
him, to the other stars, although without expressing any opinion as
to whether these other stars were inhabited or not. At the end of the
next century Giordano Bruno wrote that “there are endless particular
worlds similar to this of the earth.” He plainly supposed these other
worlds—“the moon, planets and other stars, which are infinite in
number’’—to be inhabited, since he regarded their creation as evidence
of the Divine goodness. He was burned at the stake in 1600; had
he lived only 10 years longer, his convictions would have been
strengthened by Galileo’s discovery of mountains and supposed seas
on the moon.

The arguments of Kepler and Newton led to a general recognition
that the stars were not other worlds like our earth but other suns
like our sun. When once this was accepted it became natural to
imagine that they also were surrounded by planets and to picture each
sun as showering life-sustaining light and heat on inhabitants more or
less like ourselves. In 1829 a New York newspaper scored a great
journalistic hit by giving a vivid, but wholly fictitious, account of
the activities of the inhabitants of the moon as seen through the
telescope recently erected by His Majesty’s Government at the Cape.

It will be a long time before we could see what the New York paper
claimed to see on the moon—batlike men flying through the air and
inhabiting houses in trees—even if it were there to see. To see an
object of human size on the moon in detail we should need a tele-
scope of from 10,000 to a 100,000 inches aperture, and even then we
should have to wait years, or more probably centuries, before the air
was still and clear enough for us to see details of human size.

To detect general evidence of life on even the nearest of the planets
would demand far larger telescopes than anything at present in ex-
istence, unless this evidence occupied an appreciable fraction of the
planet’s surface. The French astronomer Flammarion once sug-
gested that if chains of light were placed on the Sahara on a sufficiently
generous scale, they might be visible to Martian astronomers if any
such there be. If this light were placed so as to form a mathematical
pattern, intelligent Martians might conjecture that there was intel-
ligent life on earth. Flammarion thought that the lights might suit-
ably be arranged to illustrate the theorem of Pythagoras (Euclid, I.
47). Possibly a better scheme would be a group of searchlights which
could emit successive flashes to represent a series of numbers. If, for
instance, the numbers 8, 5, 7, 11, 18, 17, 19, 28 ... (the sequence
of primes) were transmitted, the Martians might surely infer the
existence of intelligent Tellurians. But any visual communication
between planets would need a combination of high telescopic power
at one end and of engineering works on a colossal, although not im-
possible, scale at the other.

Some astronomers—mainly in the past—have thought that the so-
called canals on Mars provide evidence of just this kind, although of
course unintentionally on the part of the Martians. Two white
patches which surround the two poles of Mars are observed to increase
and decrease with the seasons, like our terrestrial polar ice. Over the
surface of Mars some astronomers have claimed to see a geometrical
network of straight lines, which they have interpreted as a system of
irrigation canals, designed to bring melted ice from these polar caps
to parched equatorial regions. Percival Lowell calculated that this
could be done by a pumping system of 4,000 times the power of
Niagara. It is fairly certain now that the polar caps are not of ice,
but even if they were, the radiation of the summer sun on Mars is
so feeble that it could not melt more than a very thin layer of ice before
the winter cold came to freeze it solid again. Actually the caps are
observed to change very rapidly and are most probably clouds consist-
ing of some kind of solid particles.

The alleged canals cannot be seen at all in the largest telescopes nor
can they be photographed, but there are technical reasons why neither
of these considerations is conclusive against the existence of the canals.
A variety of evidence suggests, however, that the canals are mere
subjective illusions—the result of overstraining the eyes in trying to
see every detail of a never very brightly illuminated surface. Experi-
ments with school children have shown that under such circumstances
the strained eye tends to connect patches of color by straight lines.
This will at least explain why various astronomers have claimed to
see straight lines not only on Mars, where it is just conceivable that
there might be canals, but also on Mecury and the largest satellite
LIFE ON OTHER WORLDS—JEANS 147

of Jupiter, where it seems beyond the bounds of possibility that canals
could have been constructed, as well as on Venus, on which real canals
could not possibly be seen since its solid surface is entirely hidden
under clouds. It may be significant that E. E. Barnard, perhaps the
most skilled observer that astronomy has ever known, was never
able to see the canals at all, although he studied Mars for years through
the largest telescopes.

A more promising line of approach to our problem is to examine
which, if any, of the planets is physically suitable for life. But we
are at once confronted with the difficulty that we do not know what
precise conditions are necessary for life. A human being transferred
to the surface of any one of the planets or of their satellites, would
die at once, and this for several different reasons on each. On Jupiter
he would be simultaneously frozen, asphyxiated, and poisoned, as
well as doubly pressed to death by his own weight and by an atmos-
pheric pressure of about a million terrestrial atmospheres. On Mer-
cury he would be burned to death by the sun’s heat, killed by its ultra-
violet radiation, asphyxiated from want of oxygen, and desiccated
from want of water. But this does not touch the question of whether
other planets may not have developed species of life suited to their
own physical conditions. When we think of the vast variety of con-
ditions under which terrestrial life exists on earth—plankton, soil
bacteria, stone bacteria, and the great variety of bacteria which are
parasitic on the higher forms of hfe—it would seem rash to suggest
that there are any physical conditions whatever to which life cannot
adapt itself. Yet as the physical states of other planets are so dif-
ferent from that of our own, it seems safe to say that any life there
may be on any of them must be very different from the life on earth.

The visible surface of Jupiter has a temperature of about —138° C.,
which represents about 248 degrees of frost on the Fahrenheit scale.
The planet probably comprises an inner core of rock, with a surround-
ing layer of ice some 16,000 miles in thickness, and an atmosphere
which again is several thousands of miles thick and exerts the pressure
of a million terrestrial atmospheres which we have already mentioned.
The only known constituents of this atmosphere are the poisonous
gases methane and ammonia. It is certainly hard to imagine such
a planet providing a home for life of any kind whatever. The planets
Saturn, Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto, being farther from the sun,
are almost certainly even colder than Jupiter and in all probability
suffer from at least equal disabilities as abodes of life.

Turning sunward from these dismal planets, we come first to Mars,
where we find conditions much more like those of our own planet.
The average temperature is about —40° C., which is also —40° on the
Fahrenheit scale, but the temperature rises above the freezing point

501591—49—_11
148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

oh summer afternoons in the equatorial regions. ‘The atmosphere
contains at most only small amounts of oxygen and carbon dioxide,
perhaps none at all, so that there can be no vegetation comparable
with that of the earth. The surface, in so far as it can be tested by
a study of its powers of reflection and polarization, appears to con-
sist of lava and volcanic ash. To us it may not seem a promising
or comfortable home for life, but life of some kind or other may be
there nevertheless.

Being at the same average distance from the sun as the earth, the
moon has about the same average temperature, but the variations
around this average temperature are enormous, the equatorial tem-
perature varying roughly from 120° C. to —80° C. The telescope
shows high ranges of mountains, apparently volcanic, interspersed
with flat plains of voleanic ash. The moon has no atmosphere and
consequently no water; it shows no signs of life or change of any
kind, unless perhaps for rare falls of rock such as might result from
the impact of meteors falling in from outer space. A small town
on the moon, perhaps even a large building, ought to be visible in
our largest telescopes, but, needless to say, we see nothing of the
kind.

Venus, the planet next to the earth, presents an interesting prob-
lem. It is similar to the earth in size but being nearer the sun is
somewhat warmer. As it is blanketed in cloud we can only guess as
to the nature of its surface. But its atmosphere can be studied and
is found to contain little or no oxygen, so that the planet’s surface
can hardly be covered with vegetation as the surface of the earth is.
Indeed, its surface is probably so hot that water would boil away.
Yet no trace of water vapor is found in the atmosphere, so that the
planet may well be devoid of water. There are reasons for thinking
that its shroud of clouds may consist of solid particles, possibly
hydrates of formaldehyde. Clearly any life that this planet may
harbor must be very different from that of the earth.

The only planet that remains is Mercury. This always turns the
same face to the sun and its temperature ranges from about 420° C.
at the center of this face to unimaginable depths of cold in the eternal
night of the face which never sees the sun. The planet is too feeble
gravitationally to retain much of an atmosphere and its surface, in
so far as this can be tested, appears to consist mainly of volcanic ash
like the moon and Mars. Once again we have a planet which does
not appear promising as an abode of life and any life that there may
be must be very different from our own.

Thus our survey of the solar system forces us to the conclusion
that it contains no place other than our earth which is at all suitable
for life at all resembling that existing on earth. The other planets
LIFE ON CTHER WORLDS—JEANS 149

are ruled out largely by unsuitable temperatures. It used to be
thought that Mars might have had a temperature more suited to life
in some past epoch when the sun’s radiation was more energetic than
it now is, and that similarly Venus can perhaps look forward to a
more temperate climate in some future age. But these possibilities
hardly accord with modern views of stellar evolution. The sun is
now thought to be a comparatively unchanging structure, which has
radiated much as now through the greater part of its past life and
will continue to do the same until it changes cataclysmically into a
minute “white dwarf” star. When this happens there will be a fall
of temperature too rapid for life to survive anywhere in the solar
system and too great for new life ever to get a foothold. As regards
suitability for life, the earth seems permanently to hold a unique
position among the bodies surrounding our sun.

Our sun is, however, only one of myriads of stars in space. Our
own galaxy alone contains about 100,000 million stars, and there are
perhaps 10,000 million similar galaxies in space. Stars are about
as numerous in space as grains of sand in the Sahara. What can we
say about the possibilities of life on planets surrounding these other
suns?

We want first to know whether these planets exist. Observational
astronomy can tell us nothing; if every star in the sky were surrounded
by a planetary system like that of our sun, no telescope on earth could
reveal a single one of these planets. Theory can tell us a little more.
While there is some doubt as to the exact manner in which the sun
acquired its family of planets, all modern theories are at one in sup-
posing that it was the result of the close approach of another star.
Other stars in the sky must also experience similar approaches, al-
though calculation shows that such events must be excessively rare.
Under conditions like those which now prevail in the neighborhood
of the sun, a star will experience an approach close enough to generate
planets only about once in every million million million years. If we
suppose the star to have lived under these conditions for about
2,000 million years, only one star in 500 million will have experienced
the necessary close encounter, so that at most one star in 500 million
will be surrounded by planets. This looks an absurdly minute fraction
of the whole, yet when the whole consists of a thousand million million
million stars, this minute fraction represents two million million stars.
On this caculation, then, two million million stars must already be sur-
rounded by planets and a new solar system is born every few hours.
The calculation probably needs many adjustments; for instance, con-
ditions near our sun are not necessarily typical of conditions through-
cut space and the conditions of today are probably not typical of con-
ditions in past ages. Indeed, on any reasonable view of stellar evolu-
150 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

tion, each star must have begun its life as a vast mass of nebulous
gas, in which state it would present a far more vulnerable target than
now for disruptive attacks by other stars. Detailed calculation shows
that the chance of a star’s producing planets in this early stage,
although not large, would be quite considerable, and suggests, with a
large margin to spare, that although planetary systems may be rare in
space, their total number is far from insignificant. Out of the thou-
sands or millions of millions of planets that there must surely be in
space, a very great number must have physical conditions very similar
to those prevailing on earth.

We cannot even guess whether these are inhabited by life like our
own or by life of any kind whatever. The same chemical atoms exist
there as exist here and must have the same properties, so that it 1s
likely that the same inorganic compounds have formed there as have
formed here. If so, we would like to know how far the chain of life
has progressed, but present-day science can give no help. We can only
wonder whether any life there may be elsewhere in the universe has
succeeded in managing its affairs better than we have done in recent
years,

“~ SOLAR RADIATION AND THE STATE OF THE
ATMOSPHERE!

By HARLAN TRUE STEISON
Massachusetts Institute of Technology

[With 4 plates]

Yor a week before the great aurora of September 18, 1941, with the
attendant wide-spread disturbances to radio communication, the sun
had been heralding the event. Although the sunspot cycle has been
definitely on the wane since 1937, the week preceding the 18th pre-
sented one of the largest groups of spots seen in recent years, so con-
spicuous, in fact, that it was visible to the naked eye through suitable
dark glasses. The forecasting of interruptions to radio communication
is of increasing significance in these days of national defense, but the
ability to foresee communication interruptions has been a recent result
of intersified interest in the stduy of relationships between solar dis-
turbances and terrestrial atmospheric conditions.

The sun is a typical star of rather ordinary proportions, but because
of our proximity to it, the sun is the one star upon whose radiations
activities on the earth are unalterably dependent. Military campaigns
as well as agriculture since the dawn of civilization must be governed
by the seasons for which the changing declination of the sun is the
major astromonical factor. With the conquest of the upper air for
transportation and the use of atmospheric electric waves for world-
wide radio communication, the study of the sun’s radiations in relation
to our atmosphere has become an astronomical problem of far more
than academic interest.

Not a day passes but that our United States Naval Observatory in
cooperation with other observatories has a complete photographic
record of the conditions of the sun’s surface. When a huge solar storm
is in the making, communication agencies are forewarned days in
advance of probable periods of interrupted radio reception. The ques-
tion of the relation of sunspots to the forecasting of weather is still
in a controversial stage, but meteorologists are beginning to realize the
increasing significance of conditions in the high atmosphere to the

151
152 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

lower regions in which our weather appears to arise. All weather is
fundamentally traceable to solar radiation. The amount and the char-
acter of this radiation, particularly in its relationship to atmospheric
phenomena, merits more detailed consideration.

From observations at the Smithsonian Institution, the amount of
energy that the sun emits has been measured with such precision that
we know not only the quantity of heat and light emitted, but that this
quantity varies from time to time by some 2 or 3 percent. The aver-
age energy received by the earth from the sun is about 450 million
million horsepower. Because of the relatively insignificant size of the
earth, and also the great distance that separates us from the sun—
a distance of 93 million miles—our planet can intercept but about
one two-billionth of the total solar output. Even so, if we stop to
consider what the cost to us would be were we charged for a year’s
service of heat and light from the Solar Utilities Power and Light
Company, we would find our indebtedness mounting to staggering pro-
portions. At a price of 134 cents per kilowatt hour, the annual budget
that would have to be allowed for sunshine for the continental United
States alone would represent an expenditure of 327 quadrillion dollars.
Such figures are indeed difficult to imagine. If we change our picture
to amore restricted one, we can say that the cost of sunshine for Greater
New York at the above figure would amount to approximately 100
million dollars for the average day. Fortunately for us, millions of
years ago this same sunshine provided the energy for growing the
vast tropical forests of the carboniferous era. The carbon in those
fallen tree trunks that we are mining today in the form of coal together
with the water power provided by the vast irrigating systems main-
tained by the sun’s radiation is the source for the maintenance of our
public utilities and industries today. It is an interesting question as
to how long the sun can maintain its present output of radiation and
how far into the future we may rely upon its ability to furnish us with
this all-essential source of energy. It appears probable that within
the hot interior of the sun, which may be estimated in terms of millions
of degrees, an atomic transmutation is taking place that has been going
on for millions of years and is likely to continue for a long time to
come. Through an ingenious carbon cycle recently worked out by
Professor Bethe, of Cornell University, we picture the ultimate trans-
formation of hydrogen into helium with the continual release of
energy in the form of radiation that represents a loss of mass to the sun
of some 4,200,000 tons every second. We scarcely need worry, how-
ever, about the deterioration of the fuel supply while the sun has about
2,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 tons of matter still left in it.

If we analyze the radiation from the sun we discover that it covers
a wide range of wave lengths. Certain of these wave lengths or fre-
SOLAR RADIATION AND ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 153

quencies produce their own special effects upon the earth and its
atmosphere.

We are all familiar with the fact that if sunlight is split into
its component colors by means of a spectroscope we can see a large
variety of the radiations represented by the various parts or colors of
the solar spectrum. The visible range to which the eye responds
represents frequencies extending from 400 million million cycles per
second to a frequency just about double this, or 800 million million
cycles per second. The sensation of the higher of these two frequen-
cies is that of violet light, and the sensation produced by the 400 mil-
lion million cycle frequency is that of deep red light. In between these
two extremes of the spectrum fall the intervening colors. But outside
this so-called visible range to which the eye responds there is a vast
scale of radiations both beyond the red end of the spectrum, which
we call the infrared, and far down below the violet, which we call
the ultraviolet.

By means of the photographic plate, we can extend the map of
the spectrum in either direction. Far out beyond the red end are
heat radiations from the sun that may be measured with the thermo-
pile or the bolometer. Today much research is being done in measur-
ing the extremely short waves, or high-frequency radiations out beyond
the violet, for the ultraviolet is coming to have increasing importance
not only from the point of view of health but from the point of view
of the radio engineer.

The sunlight which we measure or analyze at the earth’s surface
is, however, seriously modified by the absorption introduced by the
constituents of our own atmosphere. As we all know, the earth’s
atmosphere consists of nearly 14 oxygen and 34 nitrogen. There is a
sprinkling of carbon dioxide with a bit of argon, neon, crypton, xenon,
and a trace of helium. Here at the earth’s surface we can count on a
little more than 1 percent of water vapor. For a thorough mixing
of the elements of this atmosphere and the maintenance of its tempera-
ture as well as the variation in its temperature, we rely upon the sun.
Occasionally we have vividly impressed upon us the relationship of
our atmosphere to disturbances on the sun, by displays of aurorae or
the Polar Lights, often flaming gorgeously red and stretching 100
miles above the earth. These glowing electric discharges advertise
the lofty air swarming with the traffic of electrons, ions, and particles,
jostling one another as they are excited by radiations from the sun
peculiar to the occurrences of sunspot activity.

Observations with the spectroscope indicate that there is much
radiation at the extreme ultraviolet end of the spectrum to which
the earth’s atmosphere is completely opaque. A great deal of the
absorption of this region of the solar spectrum of very short wave
lengths is caused by a layer of ozone which exists at an average height
154 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

of about 22 kilometers, but which probably occupies a region extend-
ing from 15 to 35 kilometers. If all the ozone in this region were
to be brought to the standard conditions of temperature and pressure
of our atmosphere at the earth’s surface, it would represent a layer
of only 2 to 3 millimeters in thickness. Yet this small amount of
ozone is the defense between us and extremely dangerous radiations
in the ultraviolet region of the sun’s light. Were the absorption,
however, of this region of the solar spectrum even a little greater
than it is, we should be deprived of that small amount of ultraviolet
light filtering through our atmosphere that is so essential for health
and the production of our sunshine vitamin D. Whether or not
variations in the sun’s radiation are sufficiently great or changes in
the absorption of the earth’s atmosphere sufficiently large to bring
about dangerous variations in the production of vitamin D in living
organisms at the earth’s surface is an interesting question for specula-
tion and for investigation.

We can be confident, however, that it is a fortunate combination
of the sun and our atmosphere that makes life on the earth possible.

‘he sun not only radiates its health-giving sunshine, but it also emits
literally death-dealing rays. Were it not for the protecting shield of
the earth’s atmosphere, the sun would be the annihilator of us all.
The atmosphere provides on the one hand oxygen for maintaining
life, and on the other hand protects us from the highly penetrating
rays. It is a sort of a buffer state, the very top of which receives a
violent bombardment of high-frequency radiations from the sun, and
the lower layers of which form a blanket that enables the earth to
retain during the night much of the warmth generated by the sun-
shine that has penetrated through it, thus mitigating the extremes of
temperature between night and day to which the earth would other-
wise be subjected.

If we look at a cross section of the earth’s atmosphere, it may for
convenience be divided into three zones or layers in which the strato-
sphere occupies the middle ground. The region below the strato-
sphere is that which contacts our immediate surroundings and
provides the winds and atmospheric currents, giving rise to all our
weather. We call this lower region comprising perhaps the first 5
or 6 miles the troposphere. The region above the stratosphere is
the ionosphere. If we send a recording thermometer aloft, we find
that while passing through the troposphere the temperature steadily
falls until a height of 10 or 12 kilometers is reached, when the
temperature reaches the extremely low value of —55° C., or some
68° below zero Fahrenheit. Strangely enough, for the next 30 miles
or so there appears to be little change in temperature. This is the
region of the stratosphere. The weather forecaster for the strato-
sphere would have a relatively simple task, for day after day, year
SOLAR RADIATION AND ATMOSPHERE—-STETSON 1 2595)

in and year out, his prognostications would be “clear and cool,” and
his forecasts would be 100 percent correct. At a height of 60 kilome-
ters or some 40 miles, the temperature would begin to rise again.
Recent investigations give some evidence that at extreme heights,
up where the auroral fires play, temperatures of 1,000° C. have
to be postulated to account for the presence of the ionized oxygen
that is there. The extremely rarefied condition of this upper at-
mosphere, however, calls for perhaps a quite different interpretation
of temperature than that to which we are ordinarily accustomed
when determining temperatures by the thermometer at the earth’s
surface.

Ascending through the cross sections of the atmosphere, we find
there is a rapid decrease in the amount of atmospheric pressure.
Within the first 3 miles from the earth’s surface, half the total

amount of oxygen and nitrogen, the principal atmospheric ingredi-
ents, are included. The limiting height to which the thinning
atmosphere extends is somewhat difficult to fix. Perhaps we should
place it at 200 to 300 miles, although recently Dr. Carl St6rmer has
observed auroral streamers reaching to heights of 600 kilometers
or more. Where auroral streamers go, some of the thin atmosphere
must extend.

If we make a chart of the numbers and occurrences of aurorae we
find there seems to be a curious connection between the frequency
and brightness of auroral displays and the state of the sun as marked
by the appearance of sunspots. Professor Brooks, director of the
Blue Hill Observatory, has kindly allowed me access to the records
made of aurorae at that station for the last 30 years. Utilizing
the observations of the brighter aurorae, we may make a graph
showing the variations in the auroral frequencies occurring in years
156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

distributed with respect to the maximum occurrences of sunspots.
The fewest number of aurorae appear to occur from 4 to 6 years
before or after the years marking sunspot maxima. The time when
aurorae appear most frequently would seem to be about 2 years after
the passing of the maximum of sunspots. These results corroborate
rather well those of a longer series of observations tabulated by Dr.
Chree extending for over 100 years, or from 1750 to 1877.

The fact that aurorae occur with far greater frequency during
years when sunspots are more numerous than during the years when
there is a scarcity of sunspots suggests that the electrical effect in
the upper atmosphere is something for which a disturbed solar
surface is responsible. There is, I believe, a good reason for the
fact that the maximum in the auroral displays occurs a year or two
after the year of most sunspots. As sunspots begin to wane in
numbers, they are nevertheless occurring in regions progressively
nearer the solar equator, and as the sun’s equator is inclined but
slightly to the plane of the earth’s orbit, we may draw the inference
that sunspots are most effectively associated with the occurrence of
aurorae when, other things being equal, they are most nearly in the
geometrical plane that the earth travels in its journey around the
sun.

Much of our present knowledge of aurorae is due to the exhaustive
studies and mathematical calculations of Dr. Stérmer, of Blindern,
Norway. By careful analysis of the motion of charged particles
in the magnetic field of the earth, he has been able to deduce tracks
of ionization so simulating auroral forms as to indicate very signifi-
cantly that such discharges in the upper atmosphere are indeed the
result of bombardments of electrons coming in from outside, warped
by the magnetic field of the earth. In endeavoring to express such
phenomena on an electronic hypothesis we may well look at the sun,
therefore, for a consideration of the character of sunspots and so
trace any possible mechanism by which corpuscular charges might
be ejected in the region of the sunspots themselves.

When we look at an enlarged view of a sunspot and analyze the
light from it, we find that the dark interior center is surrounded
by a turbulent area. Photographs taken in the light emitted by
hydrogen at a particular frequency reveal that there are whirling
masses of gas, arranging themselves in veritable vortices. ‘There is
every indication, then, that a sunspot is in reality a terriffic solar
hurricane. It was in 1908 that the late Dr. George Ellery Hale,
the founder and director of the Mount Wilson Observatory, first
observed that sunspots were giant cyclones in the sun’s atmosphere.
They are indeed very similar in their formation to the tropical
hurricanes that originate in the West Indies and sweep northward.

With photographic emulsions made especially sensitive to the red
SOLAR RADIATION AND ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 157

light emitted by hydrogen, there may be photographed on a moving
film the entire solar surface so far as it is covered by bright luminous
hydrogen clouds. The resulting representations of the sun appear
very different from photographs make in ordinary light. Not only
are large clouds of hydrogen gas discernible all over the sun, but
in the neighborhood of sunspots they often seem to be swept into
the heart of the spot as if they were caught in the center of a whirl-
pool. Such an appearance might be presented by the top of a ter-
restrial cyclone or tornado if photographed from a stratospheric
balloon. The dark center of the spot forms the center of the vor-
tex; the outlying shaded region that characterizes the so-called
penumbra of the sunspot would represent the turbulence bordering
upon the central funnel about which the atmospheric particles are
rapidly rotating. Thus we see there is a close analogy between the
meteorology of tropical cyclones and that of sunspots. To carry
the analogy still further, spots north of the sun’s equator are in
general whirling in one direction while corresponding spots south
of the equator whirl in the opposite direction. If the rotation of
the one is clockwise, that of the other is counterclockwise. This
again is characteristic of the differences of rotation of tropical hurri-
canes on the earth originating in the northern and southern hemi-
spheres, respectively.

Had it not been for the trick of splitting up sunlight into isolated
frequencies by means of the spectroscope, we should never have had
pictures showing the existence of solar vortices such as we have
today. In the ordinary photograph of the sun, the light emitted by
every chemical element in the sun’s atmosphere is clamoring to tell
its story. The result is revealed in a rather jumbled picture of
what is happening on the sun. The spots show up as dark regions
only when the light-emitting power of every element of the sun is
damaged in the vicinity of these violently disturbed regions.

The spectroscope is very much like a highly selective radio re-
ceiving set. The sun is a high-powered station sending out light,
broadcast in all the wave lengths and frequencies. When we look at
the sun or photograph it with a telescope alone, we are using all the
light and are, so to speak, operating a radio receiver which admits all
frequencies at once. Thus we get a composite but very jumbled picture
of what is happening on the sun’s surface as far as details are con-
cerned. By means of the spectroscope, however, the photographic
apparatus, to continue our analogy, must be tuned to a single frequency
such as the 470 million megacycle frequency that the red line of
hydrogen emits. Tuned to this frequency the spectroscope stills the
tumult of all other elements and lets hydrogen tell its own story. It is
then that we obtain the clear photographs conveying so beautifully the
detailed information about the vortical whirls around the solar storm
158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

center's that would otherwise be lost in the jumble of too many story
tellers.

It has long been known that the frequencies of light waves are
distorted if there is a powerful magnetic field surrounding the ight
source. This had been demonstrated in the laboratory shortly after
the reason for such a phenomenon had been given by Zeeman in
1894. When the Mount Wilson observers first examined and
actually measured the frequency of light coming from the centers
of sunspots, it was found to have changed frequency in exactly the
way that light waves are distorted in the laboratory when a power-
ful electromagnet is placed around the source of light being ex-
amined. If additional proof were needed for the explanation of the

changed frequencies, it may be stated that the double and triple
lines found in the spectrum of sunspots indicated that the light
was polarized just as in the case of the polarized light waves coming
from the laboratory source upon which the magnetic field is im-
pressed. Thus came the startling revelation that sunspots were
not only terrific hurricanes but every center was in itself a powerful
magnet. Since a magnetic field may exert a repulsing effect upon
swiftly moving electrons, we see some reason that charged electric
particles can be actually hurled from sunspot centers at velocities
which may carry them through space into the earth’s atmosphere,
thus ionizing the upper regions of the air in a way that would
produce auroral displays. In the light of such a mechanism, there-
fore, we see a possible reason why aurorae occur in greater numbers
and at greater brilliance at times when these solar storms occur

most frequently.
With the new unsurpassed equipment installed at the McMath-Hul-
bert Observatory of the University of Michigan, motion pictures of the
SOLAR RADIATION AND ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 159

sun’s surface have been made on many different frequencies of the
sun’sradiation. These cinematographic records promise more material
for the intense study of the behavior of the solar surface than has ever
before been available. Some of the movements in the high solar at-
mosphere over the regions of sunspots revealed by this new process of
recording continuous motion at present defy explanation and may yet
completely revolutionize our ideas of the sun’s behavior pattern.

Perhaps the terrestrial effect that has most nearly paralleled the sun-
spot cycle is the variation in the state of the earth’s magnetic field. For
over 100 years, it has been definitely known that the direction of the
compass needle and the intensity of the earth’s magnetic field show
definite relationships. In the years when sunspots are most numerous
magnetic disturbances are most frequent and appear with marked in-
tensity. The years when sunspots are most numerous follow with
more or less regularity an interval of somewhat over a decade between
the times of maximum sunspot activity. This solar cycle, or sunspot
period as we sometimes call it, is usually conceded to be on the average
of about 11.8 years duration. An examination of a graph will show
that sometimes the interval between maxima may be as short as 9
years and on occasion as long as 17 years.

The last maximum of sunspots was passed in 1937 and we are well on
our way on the down side of the cycle. It was not until the more
recent discovery of an ionized region in the upper atmosphere of the
earth that any real explanation appeared as to why sunspots and
changes in the earth’s magnetic field should show so close a parallelism.

Everyone knows in a general way that the earth is a magnetic sphere.
That the compass needle does not point true north except in various
restricted parts of the globe is also a fact which is generally recog-
nized. Perhaps comparatively few who are not geomagneticians
realize that the compass needle is constantly wandering back and forth
every day by aslight amount. When the sun rises in the east, the north
end of the compass needle turns slightly toward that direction. By
noon when the sun is south, it is pointed in its normal position. Then
in the afternoon as the sun wanders and sets in the west, the compass
needle wanders likewise to the west, coming back again to its normal
position about midnight when the sun is below the northern horizon.
This goes on day after day, month after month—but during the years
when sunspots are most numerous these daily excursions of the com-
pass needle will on the average be twice as great as during the years
when sunspots are lacking. These diurnal wanderings of the compass
needle can now be roughly explained as due to the effects of ionization
of the upper atmosphere by sunlight. As the electric charges become
separated in the process of ionization f the omlecules of nitrogen and
oxygen under the bombardment of ultraviolet light from the sun,
the movements of these ions create a perceptible current, deflecting
160 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

the compass needle from its normal magnetic position. We may infer,
therefore, that at times of sunspot maxima the number of these ions in
the upper air is materially increased, producing a more marked mag-
netic effect. The strength of the magnetic field of the earth, therefore,
may be considered as increasing and decreasing with the variation in
the intensity of the ionization of the upper air that changes with sun-
spot occurrences. Most of our knowledge of the ionized region has
come about through the invention of the radio.

In the early days of wireless, it was thought that electric waves
which carried telegraph messages without wires traveled in straight
lines over the earth, just as hght waves do. With this conception
one could never hope to communicate over very great distances, since
the curvature of the earth would prevent the passage of the waves as
the earth’s huge bulk bulged into the communication path. The earlier
wireless engineers thought that only by building higher and higher
antenna towers could one ultimately hope to communicate over the
thousands of miles that would make transoceanic wireless possible.

Of course, these early crude notions about the way in which electric
waves travel were erroneous. Such, nevertheless, is the way in which
science has groped into the unknown. Somebody experimenting with
wireless and listening in found himself quite unconsciously eaves-
dropping on Marconi waves from the other side of the Atlantic.
Instantly the thought about how wireless waves travel had to be
changed. Evidently the electromagnetic waves followed the curvature
of the earth and did not travel in straight lines after all. This led
Professor Kennelly of Harvard to postulate that there must exist high
above the earth’s surface, perhaps 100 miles or so up, an electrified con-
ducting layer from which the electromagnetic waves emitted from the
powerful antennae were reflected back to earth. The earth’s upper
atmosphere, therefore, in his mind formed a conducting layer and
imprisoned the radio waves between the earth’s surface and space
cutside. A few months after Professor Kennelly published his
hypothesis, the English scientist, Oliver Heaviside, announced a simi-
lar conclusion quite independently. In honor of these two distin-
guished men this upper region of the earth’s atmosphere that is
electrically ionized is commonly referred to as the Kennelly-Heaviside
layer, also designated as the E layer.

If we look at a diagram (pl. 2) which presents a vertical section of
the earth and its atmosphere, we see that this Kennelly-Heaviside layer
exists at an altitude of from 100 to 130 kilometers. Radio waves
emitted from a sending station in all directions arriving in this ionized
region have their velocity and direction changed as they penetrate
farther and farther into the region, until at length they are bent
back to earth again, reaching receiving stations hundreds and some-
times thousands of miles from the source whence they were broadcast.
SOLAR RADIATION AND ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 161

This region lies far above the stratosphere and generally above the
region that is usually regarded as that where ozone is manufactured.
This E layer is particularly favorable for reflecting or turning back
radio waves of the frequencies which are most generally used for
commercial broadcasting in connection with our entertainment pro-
grams. Radio waves of much shorter wave lengths or of higher fre-
quencies penetrate and actually traverse through this region until they
reach what appears to be another ionized region called the F layer,
originally postulated by Professor Appleton in England. This F
layer lies some 200 kilometers high or in the territory where auroral
streamers stage their gorgeous displays. If the ionization of these
upper regions is more intense as we near the period of maximum sun-
spot activity, one might well expect that some change might be
observed in connection with radio transmission.

Anticipating a new field of research, a Boston radio engineer, G. W.
Pickard, and myself became interested in the making of quantitative
measurements of radio reception during the sunspot maximum of 1928
in an endeavor to discover if such anticipated effects on radio com-
munication could be measured. After a few years’ observations, it
appeared to be evident that when solar activity increased the field
strength of a Chicago broadcasting station observed in Boston notably
weakened, whereas as sunspots became less numerous there was a
marked increase in the intensity of the radio waves from Chicago.
A similar investigation carried on during the decline of sunspots from
1930 to 1982 between Chicago and the Perkins Observatory of Dela-
ware, Ohio, yielded data to indicate that with a decrease of sunspots
from a monthly average of 60 at the beginning of 1930 to a monthly
average of about 10 in 1932, radio reception increased sixfold in its
intensity.

Continued observations of the Chicago-Boston field strengths in
recent years have continued to substantiate the general effect earlier
observed. While there may be a 600 percent change in the field
strengths between a sunspot maximum and a sunspot minimum, this
does not mean that the degree of ionization in the Kennelly-Heaviside
layer has been altered by this amount. The field strength of a radio
wave at a given distance for a given frequency depends upon the angle
of reflection or refraction which in turn is dependent upon the degree
of ionization. Field strength also depends upon the absorption of the
waves, which is a function of the conductivity. Appleton has esti-
mated from his observations that the ionization and the electrical con-
ductivity of the E and F regions in passing from sunspot maximum
to sunspot minimum have shown variations of 50 to 60 percent imply-
ing that the solar ionizing agent (ultraviolet light) responsible for the
formation of these regions in the ionosphere varies from 120 to 150
percent during the sunspot cycle,
162 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

We thus see that radio becomes a sensitive and extremely useful
tool in recording changes of degree of ionization of the upper atmos-
phere. When we observe radio field strengths at long distances we

are in a way tracing an integrated effect throughout the whole trans-
mission path for a given frequency.

sonal and diurnal variations. The fact that the lowest curve parallels closely
sunspot activity in the 0° to +15° zones suggests effect of solar disturbances
is greatest when spots are near solar equator.

Another way in which we gain important information as to the
sun’s effect upon the upper atmosphere is by making radio soundings
from day to day. This method, which has been in use for some
years at the National Bureau of Standards, at the Department of
Terrestrial Magnetism of the Carnegie Institution in Washington and
elsewhere, consists in sending up a radio pulse of known frequency
and recording its return from the reflecting layer. The time elapsed
while the wave was traveling this path to the ionosphere and back
is measured with high precision on an oscillograph. Assuming that
the radio wave travels with the velocity of light, one can calculate
SOLAR RADIATION AND ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 163

from the elapsed time the height to which the pulse ascended before
it was turned back by the ionosphere.

Soundings made of the ionosphere reveal different conditions at
various times, displaying marked changes in the ionic density that
are dependent upon the hour of the day and the season of the year.
Routine radio soundings include changing the frequency at which the
radio pulse is emitted. If the frequency is sufficiently increased, the
shorter and more penetrating waves may pass completely through the
ionized layer and not return. When such a frequency is attained, it
is known as the critical frequency.

1946

Figure 4.—Critical frequencies follow sunspots. Curve smoothed by 12-month
moving averages.

The close relation between the observed critical frequencies and the
rise and fall in solar activity marked by sunspot numbers has been
so apparent during the last 10 years that the National Bureau of
Standards now undertakes to predict 3 months in advance the best
usable frequencies for radio communication based upon the sun-
spot cycle. |

501591—43 12

164 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

During the last few years of sunspot activity, there have been
occasions when remarkable fade-outs have occurred in radio com-
munication. In several of these instances extraordinary explosions
have occurred on the sun simultaneously with the interruption of all
radio communication in general. It would appear that the intense
ionizing radiation from the region of the sun where these eruptions
occur reaches the earth with the velocity of light and of sufficient
intensity to disturb immediately the ionized layer, confusing the
reflection of radio waves, and thereby resulting in these fade-outs
which sometimes last for an hour or more. Records at magnetic
observatories show that during such instances characteristics of the
earth’s magnetic field are likewise suddenly altered.

Could we visualize the ethereal substance of the ionosphere as we
visualize the surface of the ocean, we should find times when terrific
storms were raging in this ionosphere. Here ions and electrons are
being hurled hither and yon as through some great electrical wind
played upon its surface, creating waves literally miles high. Fre-
quently the turbulence attains such proportions that no reflecting
surface for radio communication seems possible at all. When dis-
turbances on the sun subside, the undulations in the ionosphere may
quiet down and there is a return to more normal conditions for com-
munication traffic through this ocean of the upper air.

While knowledge of the sun has helped us to understand the
vagaries of radio, we are coming to see that radio is one of the most
important tools for learning about what happens on the sun and how
disturbances there affect the ions in this upper air. Perhaps some
day, even though the sky is cloudy, we shall have a sufficient number
of reports of radio conditions over the globe so that we can form a
very good idea as to what is happening on the surface of the sun
by the way in which world-wide radio communication behaves.
Unlike the telescope, radio apparatus does not go out of commission
when the sky is overcast, for electric waves, of course, pass through
the clouds as easily as ordinary daylight comes through window glass.

Concerning the exact method or methods by means of which the
sun produces all these electric disturbances of the upper air with
the concomitant magnetic variations in the earth, we still lack a
great deal of knowledge. The fact that the ultraviolet radiation
from the sun is the major factor in producing this ionization appears
a reasonable assumption. Whether or not, in addition to the effect
of the ultraviolet light, streams of charged particles also emanate
from the sun in the regions of sunspots is perhaps still debatable,
yet there is accumulating evidence that in addition to the wave radia-
tion from the sun there is also a particle radiation that is primarily
responsible for the violent magnetic disturbances such as accompanied
the marked solar activity of Easter week in 1940, The elaborate
SOLAR RADIATION AND ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 165

mathematical work of Dr. Stérmer, in calculating the movements
of hypothetical charged particles from the sun striking the upper
atmosphere of the earth and thereby producing aurorae, would cer-
{tainly seem to favor the idea that corpuscular radiation of some sort
is responsible for this phenomenon.

We have recently made a study of our last 10 years of recordings of
field strengths from WBBM Chicago as received in the vicinity of
Boston for days immediately preceding and following conspicuous
auroral displays. Comparisons have also been made of the index of
sunspottedness for the same intervals. It was immediately apparent
from our statistical analysis that on the average auroral displays

followed by 1 day the highest value of sunspottedness, and that on the
average 1 to 2 days aiter the auroral displays occurred, the weakest
field strengths on the 770 ke. frequency were recorded. Since waves
in the broadcast band are returned from the E layer of the ionosphere,
it would appear that there is a definite lag of from 24 to 48 hours be-
tween the disturbances in the auroral zone and the greatest deteriora-
tion (ionization) in the E layer. Had we similar measurements of
field strengths at higher frequencies representing waves returning from
the F layer, we might expect a similar effect to occur at an interval
intermediate between the time of maximum auroral display and the
time of minimum field strengths from the E layer. Such field-strength
measurements are not available, but fortunately through the courtesy
of the Bell Telephone Laboratories we had available a record of their

of these transmission-disturbance numbers, we have an index of trans-

mission conditions comparable to the field-strength measurements in

ception from the F layer indicated a lag of roughly 12 hours after the

ionization disturbances occurring more promptly in the F layer than

parallels very closely that of transmission disturbances in the F layer.

In utilizing field-strength measurements for comparison with cosmic
phenomena it has been necessary to apply corrections for the well-
known diurnal and seasonal variations which depend upon the extent
to which the ionosphere has been illuminated by sunlight during the
preceding day. If such correction is not applied, we have of course 2

marked seasonal trend with a minimum of reception conditions in sum-
mer and a maximum in winter. The appropriate correction curve has
been derived from over 8,000 half-hourly periods of observations,
covering a range of 5° to —70° in the angular depression of the sun
below the horizon during the observational periods utilized.

The possibility that an annual or seasonal change exists that is not
allowed for by the changing declination of the sun led to the reexami-
nation of all our data of the last few years with the result that a resi-
dual annual change apparently exists with a maximum in April and
168 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

May and a minimum in September and October. The curve of this
residual annual variation strikingly parallels the annual change in the
distribution of ozone in northern latitudes as derived by Dobson. The
parallelism of these two curves suggests that possibly the cause of the
change in the ozone distribution is intimately associated with that of
the changes in the ionosphere resulting in this variation in field
strengths.

The form of the curve is similar to that of the seasonal variation of ozone con-
tent of the upper air.

For the pursuit of these studies in cosmic terrestrial relationships
a new laboratory for cosmic terrestrial research has been located in
the outskirts of the town of Needham, Mass., where conditions are
favorable for radio propagation studies with a minimum of inter-
ference, and for observations of atmospheric electric phenomena away
from the contamination due to manufacturing in a metropolitan area.
The building provides approximately 2,500 square feet of floor space
for offices and laboratories. The observational program includes the
continuous recording of solar radiation, ultraviolet light, atmospheric
potential gradient, ionic content of the lower air and atmospheric
electric discharges, as well as the continuation of the measurements of
field intensities of radio waves both in the broadcast band and at. high
frequencies. The relationship of solar observations, ionization phe-
nomena at high altitudes, and radio-wave phenomena to the meteor-
ology of the lower air affords possibilities for extensive investigations
which may become of increasing importance.
SOLAR RADIATION AND ATMOSPHERE—STETSON 169

Attempts to correlate weather changes with solar phenomena have
thus far met with varying success. In spite of many conflicting re-
sults, it appears that in general the temperature of the world at large
is somewhat higher at sunspot minima than at sunspot maxima. This
seems at first paradoxical, since we might well expect that at sunspot
maxima the sun would send us more heat and radiation than at sun-
spot minima. Many of Dr. Abbot’s observations, especially during
the earlier years, seem to corroborate this. Yet the surface tempera-
ture of the globe could be actually cooler in years when the earth is
receiving more heat from the sun, for increased heat produces in-
creased evaporation which in turn generally results in increased rain-
fall. Increased rainfall actually lowers the temperature of the earth’s
surface and again, by evaporation, continues to cool the air imme-
diately above. Furthermore, with the warming of the earth, a vast
convectional system of atmospheric currents results. As air warmed
near the surface of the earth rises, cold air flows in from the polar
regions with its chilling effects. It appears entirely possible that
even with an increase in the heat received by the earth from the sun,
as far as surface conditions are concerned, actually lower tempera-
tures would occur at selected regions.

As far as changes in the sun’s radiation affecting the general circu-
lation of the atmosphere are concerned, it is to be expected that such
changes would ultimately give rise to the formation of storms and the
storm tracks resulting. One of the difficulties in establishing any in-
timate connection between weather and sunspots is that our observa-
tions of weather tend to be very local.

If progress is to be made, it will come through a consciousness of the
distribution of weather as a whole over the entire globe. From a
more accurate picture of world weather, indications for weather in a
given locality at a given time may be more easily estimated.

Looking at the weather on a world-wide scale, Henry Helm Clay-
ton, of Canton, Mass., has found that pressures oscillate from one
region to another in some way which appears to depend upon the in-
tensity of solar activity. He finds there is an opposite trend over the
continents and oceans in summer as compared with winter, and that
the trend is different in the equatorial regions from that in the extra-
tropical belts. In the equatorial regions temperatures are distinctly
lower at sunspot maximum and higher at sunspot minimum. The
same is true in the North and South Temperate Zones, but in the
arid regions bordering the Tropics, the temperature actually aver-
ages a little higher around sunspot maximum than at sunspot mini-
mum. From his studies he concludes that while the North Atlantic
shows 10 to 20 percent more precipitation, the eastern half of the
United States is in the region where rainfall is actually less during
maximum activity on the sun. He concludes that our weather is the
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1942

result of certain progressive wavelike movements of certain disturbed
areas, orginating in different parts of the world. With each cycle of
change in solar activity, the centers of high barometric pressure move
from high latitudes to low latitudes and back again. The amplitude
of their oscillations and the speed with which these waves progress
appears to be inversely proportional to the length of the period of
oscillation.

In years of unusually high sunspot maxima, as was the case in 1937,
areas of high pressure appear to be pushed farther northward. The
return of these highs to low latitudes with accompanying colder and
clearer weather may, he believes, be so retarded under such instances
as to invert the phase of a cycle that may have persisted for some
time while the amplitudes of the oscillations were of less magnitude.
Thus there will occur severa! years when the differences in barometric
pressure between the equatorial region and North Temperate Zone
become greater than normal, to be followed by several years when the
pressure differences become less than normal. The shifting of these
centers of action, Clayton believes, is definitely associated with sun-
spots.

Various attempts have been made to attribute climatic cycles to
changes in solar activity. Perhaps the most outstanding scientific
contribution in this direction has come from Prof. A. E. Douglass, of
the University of Arizona, who has spent a lifetime measuring varia-
tions in tree growth, especially in the forests of the Southwest and
in California. Douglass noted that sequences in periods of rapid
growth of trees, as measured by the widths of their rings, follow very
closely the sequences in the sunspot cycle. Since variations in tree
growth suggest variations in precipitation, he has accumulated a vast
amount of evidence for alternations of wet and dry periods variable
with the sunspot cycle, carrying records backward for some 3,000
years. His studies appear to indicate that at least for selected regions,
trees have shown most growth when sunspots were most numerous. It
does not appear improbable, however, that the growth of trees inte-
grates all favorable conditions and that temperature, the quality of
sunlight, and the amount of ultraviolet radiation all enter into the
growth rate of trees as well as does rainfall.

Sunspot periods have also been traced with minor discrepancies in
the flow of rivers and the level of lakes, some regions responding much
more clearly than others to the sunspot cycle.

Altogether we see there are many indications that the earth re-
sponds to the changing state of the sun over an interval of a little
over 11 years and often by double this period or approximately 23
years. Whether all the effects produced in the earth and its atmos-
phere that are noticed at sunspot maxima are the result of the sun-
spots themselves or whether the state of the sun and its whole sur-
SOLAR RADIATION AND ATMOSPHERE—STETSON Let

roundings are so activated as to change materially the cosmic environ-
ment of the earth is a question still unanswered.

In summary, we have reviewed a few of the important ways in
which the sun and the atmosphere are closely associated. The solar
cycle marked by the coming and going of sunspots appears definitely
to be reflected in geomagnetic phenomena of the earth, in the ioniza-
tion of the upper atmosphere affecting all radio communication, in
climatic cycles of the past and in a somewhat complex manner with
weather variations today. Perhaps some day terrestrial effects yet
to be discovered may in turn become predictable through cycles that
follow law and order. Difficult as the pursuit of such investigations
may be, results already attained are a stimulus to sustained effort, and
we are becoming increasingly conscious withal of a more intimate re-
lationship between the earth and its cosmic environment than could
have been suspected a decade or two ago. In this cosmic environment
we may be assured the sun will play a major role.
