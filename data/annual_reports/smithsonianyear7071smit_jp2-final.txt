The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846
in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson of England,
who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of America
“to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowledge
among men.” In receiving the property and accepting the trust, Con-
gress determined that the federal government was without authority to
administer the trust directly, and, therefore, constituted an “establish-
ment,” whose statutory members are “the President, the Vice President,
the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive departments.”

S. Ditton RIPLEY

HIS PAST YEAR has been one of measured progress for the enter-
ee. of the Smithsonian Institution. Where many of the
prospects of the nation at large seem fraught with dissent and
division, where the path of education has become obscured by the
divisiveness which has beset the academies, the smaller private institu-
tions of learning, lacking tuition-paying students as well as football
teams, seem to have survived so far relatively unscathed.

Sometimes it seems to us that the Smithsonian and other research
institutions are rather like monasteries in medieval times, removed
from the warfare that surges round about and insulated from the
dissensions that rage throughout our public life. Our “monasteries”
are not fortified as were those in the middle ages and we have not
so far had to defend the scholars writing in their libraries and
attempting to preserve individual research and learning. Rather our
monasteries are open havens where the public comes and goes as it
will, and we hope that something of value to all our people will brush
off in the process. A notable example of the latter was the second
peace demonstration and moratorium march on 15 November 1969
when, in the cold, and with tear gas on Constitution Avenue some
81,000 persons crowded into the Museum of History and Technology,
cheek by jowl, to rest awhile and look at the objects displayed therein.
That the exercise was not purely one of rest and relaxation was wit-
nessed by the many letters and telephone calls received from all over
the country afterward which expressed thanks and grateful apprecia-
tion for the hospitality offered by the Museum, and concern and active
interest in the displays that were on view. So some benefits can be
derived even from such confrontations.

Like other institutions concerned with research and study, however,
the Smithsonian suffered in the past year from the general decline in
grants and subventions to science as well as to related areas of study.
Our problem with the declining government budgets for the support
of basic science has been compounded by the tax reform act of last
year which produced a serious paralysis of will on the part of the
foundations. Drawing back from giving while they attempted to
reassess the legal complications of the tax bill, foundations in general

1
2 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

have still not recovered entirely from the shock of the great tax
reform act. The path ahead for foundations and for philanthropy
in general is a thorny and difficult one. It appears for the moment
as if the populist theoreticians in government have won a kind of
victory and that once more the concept of the private accumulation
of wealth is cast into an atmosphere of discredit in the public mind.
Whether this trend on the part of the legislators represents a true
feeling in the country at large remains to be discerned. It seems
at this stage highly unlikely that the public tax-derived dollar will
replace foundation giving to the extent or with anywhere near the
potential versatility that the record of private philanthropy has dem-
onstrated. All of this remains for the future, however. At least it
would seem as if foundations will be somewhat more limited in the
cycle of their growth and the number of years in which they con-
tinue to operate. It seems as if a term had been put to the age of
any foundation and one can only hope that in the long run this will
not prove to be a serious or crippling blow.

One of the encouraging developments for the Institution this year
was the series of fruitful discussions held during the summer and
autumn with the Bureau of the Budget on methods of structuring the
federal part of our budget and the annual appeal for appropriations
to the Congress of the United States. For the first time the Bureau
of the Budget recognized the concept which we have continually
emphasized, that Smithsonian activities represent a kind of unity.
In spite of the many bureaus, some of them incorporated in large
buildings on the Mall and others tucked away in laboratories here
and there, there are a series of unifying themes which run through
the Institution’s activities. Our concerns remain united around the
general subjects of history, history of art, science and technology, and
the delineation of these histories through public exhibition. In addi-
tion, our science activities revolve generally around the compilation
of statistics, information, and research about the biosphere and space.
Our classical concerns in natural history and in astrophysics have
come full circle so that today we can proudly claim our work to be
of vital importance in the new sciences of the study of the environ-
ment on the one hand and of outer space on the other. Within these
common themes there are overriding considerations for the public
good. Education and public exhibition are of paramount concern for
all our main buildings and for the curators and the research staff who
inhabit them. Education through research and _ publication remains
paramount in the other bureaus whose activities are not contained in
the large public buildings. In addition, Joseph Henry’s initial concern
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 3

with bringing scholars together with colleagues in foreign countries
continues to be developed and encouraged through our foreign cur-
rency program as well as research activities both here and abroad.

We are proud of the incorporation this year of the first program
for developing studies by the Woodrow Wilson International Center
for Scholars and pleased that we shall be able to give the Woodrow
Wilson Center houseroom in the old Smithsonian building for a
temporary period of time until new quarters are found for them. It is
symbolic of the activities to which that building was dedicated in the
formative years of the Smithsonian that we should now have advanced
scholars concerned with common themes of study housed in the red
sandstone castle on the Mall. We hope that the first two broad areas
of study of the Center scholars—the international law of the sea
with its implication on planning for the appropriate and best uses
of the sea, and the broad areas of social biology—will be illuminated
by the Center’s scholars. Their studies will reflect out, I am sure,
into many of the scholarly workings of the Institution itself.

The Bureau of the Budget has encouraged us during the past year
to develop an interbureau program pointing toward the celebration of
the American Revolution Bicentennial in 1976 and subsequent years,
and for this the Congress, impressed by the goals toward which we
strive, has appropriated some funds this year for the Institution.

The second general theme approved by the Bureau is that of envi-
ronmental studies, in so many aspects of which the Smithsonian has
pioneered. We believe that the Congress will listen with interest to
our discussions in this regard and will furnish us with some funds to
begin laying out long-range plans for ecological assessments in both
the New World temperate and tropical zones and perhaps in the
Old World. Within such programs many of our scientists can find
themselves at home and with the potential of resources to add to
their critically needed funds for research. Like researchers in the
field of the natural and physical sciences everywhere we have deep
legitimate concerns for the great problems of our time. We are
uniquely equipped through possessing and working with the national
collections to contribute to solutions but we are pitifully undersup-
ported in order to make these vital concerns effective. If the science
fraternity across the land cares, we wish they would let us know and
seek ways to help.

Additionally, the events of last summer, when the Apollo 11 flight
first successfully explored the moon, prompted us to raise with the
administration whether the time might not be ripe to proceed with
the plans for the National Air and Space Museum. The language of
4p SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

the 1966 authorization was, “appropriations should not be requested
pursuant to H.R. 6125 unless and until there is a substantial reduction
in our military expenditures in Vietnam.” In the interim since 1966,
it has been our thought that the original plans for the National Air
and Space Museum, first begun in the 1950s, have through the lapse
of time become obsolescent. Museum building plans can become as
dated in their own way as the designs for an airplane engine, provided
no mock-up is constructed, no prototype tested. In the ensuing years
since the National Air and Space Museum’s plans were first drawn up,
many new concepts of exhibits as well as new thoughts about the
research potential of the Museum itself have evolved. At the same
time construction costs have escalated steadily and in an arithmetic
manner, so that today one is faced with the possibility of an annual
increment to such costs of up to 12 percent. This means that an Air
and Space Museum authorized in 1966 “not to exceed approximately
$50,000,000 in costs” may now be envisaged to cost by the mid ’70s
something in the order of $65,000,000 to $70,000,000.

The Smithsonian administration should not rest in its efforts to
make prudent use of the dollars which may be appropriated to us by
the Congress. It seems wise, therefore, to restudy the whole original
design and to set exhibit and research needs against costs in such a
way as to attempt to hold the line financially in any request to the
Congress for a firm budget. Last autumn we asked the Bureau of the
Budget for study funds, but this was unfortunately cut out of the
President’s budget for the 1970 session of the second session of the
91st Congress. We hope to go back to the Bureau of the Budget again
this year and request funds for appropriate studies of the project.
There will be only one National Air and Space Museum and we had
better make sure that it is going to be the best one that can be
feasibly obtained as well as a prudent and efficient use of government
funds. Fortunately, the cooperation of Nasa, the continued coopera-
tion of the Air and Space Museum, and the perseverance of our
budgetarily limited staff have combined to make sure that those
objects as well as the documents incorporated in the eventual building
will be of the highest quality and caliber. It is now up to us to produce
the finest building that can be constructed. Happily, Mr. Gyo Obata
of the firm of Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum has consented to
restudy and redesign the building for what we hope will be an appro-
priate cost, and this concept the Regents have approved.

In spite of the generous actions of the Congress in giving the
Smithsonian limited increases each year, which have averaged some-
where between 6 and 8 percent, it is sad to recall that costs in the
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 5

nation at large have continued to escalate so much that our scientists’
work and our research and exhibits potential have been seriously
slowed and potentially threatened in their appropriate and meritorious
growth. We have just been able to keep up with the continued na-
tional rate of inflation. It allows little for growth, expansion, and
change, so necessary for a healthy concern, be it a corporation, univer-
sity, or a research and museum complex. Examples of such needs
are continuing additions to art, history, and science collections,
modern inventory computerization for these collections, development
of new experimental ideas and fields of study—a neighborhood mu-
seum, environmental research at our Chesapeake Bay Center and our
Tropical Research Laboratory in Panama, support for the new Center
for Short-Lived Phenomena—to name but a few of a seemingly endless
list of worthy projects.

Thus there is a definite and increasingly severe confrontation be-
tween the clamor on the one hand to pursue creative ideas in pursuit
of our mandate to increase and diffuse knowledge, and on the other
hand the support of funds to permit such work to be carried out.

While vigorously seeking additional support from Congress for these
purposes, we are at the same time carrying out a program of self-
examination of the use of our total resources with the objective of
reducing or eliminating outmoded or low-priority activities. The
results of this program will be a painful but necessary and healthy
exercise.

In the case of our private finances the pressures are no less severe.
Failure to maintain a healthy balance between income and expendi-
tures could produce a serious threat to the future of the Institution.
Those unfamiliar with the Smithsonian may not realize that it was
founded by Congress as a private institution and operated without
any federal support for nine years until 1855, when at the insistence
of the government it took over the management and exhibition of the
National Museum collections. Since then, of course, the continued
accessions of magnificent collections plus growth of other federally
related activities have brought about an enlargement of this federal
support. The growth of federal support combined in recent years with
an alarming degree of inflation unmatched by growth of income from
our private endowment funds has reduced our private fund support
to less than 10 percent of our total, although research grants and
contracts awarded to the Smithsonian added to our private income
constitute about 32 percent of our total operating budget.

The fact that the Smithsonian is basically a private institution,
although federally supported, is of immense importance to its ability to
6 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

occupy its long-established and unique position. Its nonpolitical char-
acter allows us to maintain our objectivity and our contacts and
scholarly investigations in virtually all nations. The Smithsonian is a
national showplace partially supported by but not of the government,
and this attracts a continuing flow of valuable collections which would
not otherwise be available in the nation’s capital for the millions of
annual visitors.

Today it is not too much to say that the private nature of the Smith-
sonian is threatened by the inflationary advances in costs without com-
mensurate increase in private resources. While the Smithsonian private
endowment funds total about thirty million dollars, only about one
quarter of this amount is of an unrestricted nature and the annual
income from these unrestricted endowment funds is less than $400,000,
pitifully small in relation to a total annual budget of nearly fifty mil-
lion dollars. During the fiscal year 1970 alone, the need to match for
private employees the salary increases legislated for all United States
government employees, boosted private roll salary payments by 15
percent. It will be literally impossible to keep up such a heavy pace
in the future unless,a commensurate increase in private resources can
be achieved.

We are now making strenuous efforts to cope with this threat to
the future of the Institution. As in the case of federal funds, we
are also currently examining all of our private activities to eliminate
the unnecessary or less important. At the same time we are striving
vigorously to increase income from our various private activities such
as our Museum Shops and our Associates organizations. In addition,
we have launched a national campaign to build up our private endow-
ment funds to assure a substantially greater private income ‘in the
future. To this end, an Office of Development was formed in Septem-
ber 1969 with Mr. Lynford E. Kautz as Director. Under his guidance
a new national associates program has been launched with Mr.
Thomas J. Watson, Jr., a Regent, serving as Chairman. The key to
the success of the operation, is of course, our new Smithsonian maga-
zine, launched in April 1970 and already showing great promise. It is
anticipated that this program will have far-reaching benefits to the
Institution. Besides serving as a giant step forward in carrying out our
mandate to increase and diffuse knowledge among men, it can at the
same time serve as the foundation for building a national counseling
organization which will serve to attract the financial support which we
so sorely need.

In the area of publications in general, however, our funds for
assuring an appropriate stream of the products of research have been
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY rl

as seriously curtailed as they were in this Institution during the years
of World War II. In spite of appeals for additional research funds
for our scholars, Congress has not been able to award us any increase.
In spite of continued appeals to foundations and government-granting
agencies the level of funding for our research has decreased due to
stringencies and shortages elsewhere in the government.

Under these circumstances we have been pushed to the limit to
account for the dollars made available for specific purposes by the
Congress. This year particularly we were threatened with a potential
deficit in our annual operations which at one time assumed menacing
proportions. Searching and stringent action on the part of the fiscal
and personnel offices of the Smithsonian has resulted in a pruning
down of expenditures so that we have been able to balance our books
at the end of the year. But it has been a trying and difficult year for
everyone and in this sense we have reflected some of the mood of the
nation at large. It is a great credit to our research and administrative
staff as well as to the staff of the exhibits department and manifold sup-
porting activities of the Institution that they have borne these trials with
patience and understanding. In the past year or two it is as if indeed
we have been placed on truly monastic fare, bread and water. It is a
tribute to the understanding of the staff and their sharing of these
burdens that we have come through so far with morale preserved and
with cheerful good humor. In our exhibits and in aspects of our
research we can at least emphasize the positive in America and in the
American experience. Particularly in our historical exhibits this can
be a countervailing current to much of the general mood of uncer-
tainty and self-pity which prevails today.

In Joseph Henry’s view the Smithsonian existed to stimulate re-
search in pursuit of new truths and to make these truths available to
both the public and to professionals, in the arts, sciences, and cultural
history. His favorite phrase to describe the Institution’s ultimate aim
was a “College of Discoverers.” I still feel that this is the unifying
force, the common factor in all the diverse bureaus and museums of
the Smithsonian—the Institution as a “College of Discoverers” which

e First, keeps records of knowledge through its collections;

e Second, serves as a stimulus to research, largely through its collec-
tions;

e Third, and perhaps most. important, uses the collections and the
results of research for public education.

These three elements may be found to a greater or lesser degree
in all the bureaus of the Smithsonian, as they are today. What then
8 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

is the record of our most recent objectives and our present manage-
ment program?

When I returned to the Smithsonian as Secretary in 1964, the Insti-
tution was completing a major cycle of facilities development under-
taken to increase its capacity as a research institution. The National
Collection of Fine Arts and National Portrait Gallery were readying
new quarters with ample study space, in addition to new exhibition
and storage spaces. A renovation of the historic Smithsonian Institu-
tion Building was in prospect. Fourteen halls of modern research and
collection storage space were being completed for the National Mu-
seum of Natural History. The splendid new National Museum of
History and Technology had just opened, with two floors of scholarly
studies and collection storage areas. A research building was being
considered as a step in the ten-year construction program of the
National Zoological Park. The staff of our tropical research laboratory
was preparing to move from restricted quarters on Barro Colorado
Island onto the mainland and to establish strategically situated marine
biology facilities as their sphere of inquiry widened to include the
diverse habitats of Panama and the tropics as a whole. But the
administrative and fiscal requirements for the expanded research
efforts allowed by physical expansion had barely begun and there was
little understanding within the widgr community of the character
and extent of the Smithsonian’s interests in research. I felt then that
our first efforts should be to deepen the Institution’s emphasis on
research, in order to attain the advantages of the building program so
successfully carried forward by my predecessor, Dr. Carmichael. So
our professional research staff on fulltime appointments has grown,
from 243 in 1965 to 310 today. Of course without strong support
from technical assistants and support divisions such an expansion of
the research effort could not be effective since all of these necessary
functions would otherwise have to be borne on the shoulders of the
research staff, and here faltering government budget support has held
back our appropriate growth.

I have been deeply concerned about the scale of services available
from the Smithsonian Institution Libraries, an indispensable auxiliary
of all of our research. A distinguished librarian, Dr. Russell Shank,
was recruited in September 1967 from the forefront of the library
profession, given senior standing and a pledge of continued support
until our libraries could be judged adequate to the needs of the
research enterprise. That day still seems far off, for the constriction in
federal funding and freezes on employment, worsened by steadily
rising costs for subscriptions and monographs, continues to limit severe-
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 9

ly the service capacity of our libraries. This must serve only to double
our determination. The Smithsonian Institution Libraries are unique
reference systems in specialized areas not duplicated elsewhere, closely
related to the national collections which they complement.

We have sought to increase research support in the form of techni-
cians in our research laboratories and support for field investigations.
The oceanography support group, ably led by Dr. I. Eugene Wallen,
has been notably successful in expanding opportunities for staff mem-
bers to go to sea, helping to overcome a very serious lack of ship
time which severely hampered our unique effort in marine biology. An
automatic data-processing support group has been built up in both
Washington and Cambridge to meet needs for computation and
information storage.

Scientists and scholars can only be appropriately treated as profes-
sionals; they must be accorded latitude in order to act responsibly
as masters of their domains of subject matter knowledge. One of my
first aims as Secretary was to provide that department chairmen
serve in rotation “from the ranks” so to speak, and for limited terms,
in order to minimize the hazard of an internal seniority system that
might block initiative and convert scientists into permanent adminis-
trators. Research support is made available to staff members in the
form of grants and from appropriated funds, so that they will act
responsibly as principal investigators treating scarce resources as
wisely as they would funds of their own. I put an end to pre-publica-
tion review of professional publications by the Secretary, preferring
to read them as reprints from colleagues rather than submissions for
administrative clearance. We canceled a burdensome annual report
required of each staff member about his research because it served
unnecessary and merely administrative purposes. Burdensome formal
reporting can be no substitute for consultation and constant aware-
ness by supervisors. Evaluation of professional accomplishment is now
conducted by committees of peers formed in the major research units,
known as “Professional Accomplishment Evaluation Committees.”
Staff members have been encouraged to teach in universities on
official time (without added compensation) and to request changes
of their duty stations at intervals so as to be able to spend a year in
study and research without the distractions of daily office routine, an
equivalent to a university sabbatical. Travel to professional meetings
has been encouraged.

The Bicentennial of the birth of James Smithson in 1965 took the
form of an academic convocation, which we still repeat upon conven-
ing our occasional international symposia, conspicuously celebrating
10 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

our character as a community of scholars. The Smithsonian Institution
Press has been reconstituted as a scholarly publishing arm for the
Institution and more effective formats were chosen for the serials in
which staff members’ papers are published. Most important of all,
among our bureau directors and professional staff members, we have
sought to maintain shared respect for the individual pursuit of excel-
lence, whether in research, collection development, or the presentation
of knowledge to the public. The professionalization of our research
community is manifested in many ways and, of course, constitutes one
of the greatest strengths of the Institution.

In keeping with the professional character of our staff and in a
spirit of service to the nation, we have sought closer ties with the
universities. We have inaugurated programs whereby students and
other qualified investigators are freely given access to Smithsonian
facilities to conduct their own investigations. Younger visitors and
PhD candidates receive supervision from professional staff members.
Direct budgetary support for stipends for visiting scholars has been
secured for the first time from federal appropriations to the Institution.
An advisory council, drawn mostly from the universities, was consti-
tuted in 1965 to serve as a visiting committee to advise on the develop-
ment of general Institution-wide policies affecting basic research and
higher education. Control of stipend awards was delegated to com-
mittees of professional staff members. These efforts, carefully designed
to be cooperative rather than competitive, do not duplicate the efforts
of universities but serve to make our facilities and staff capabilities
available to them to the extent that funding permits. A strong program
of higher education contributes to our research environment and in-
vigorates our institutional life through lively exchanges with univer-
sities. The specialized areas of knowledge represented by our highly
skilled staff are thus guaranteed survival at a time when a number of
these disciplines of general concern have been neglected by most
colleges and universities.

We have not allowed ourselves to rest with static presentations of
objects in our collections. In order to be successful in conveying
knowledge to the wider public, exhibits must involve the viewer active-
ly, reward curiosity, invite exploration. We have sought to raise our
standards for the effectiveness of exhibits, to guard against being con-
tent merely to show an object and to seek instead to elicit from
more of our visitors those active responses and attentive regard that
betray a more affirmative understanding or comprehension of the
context of the object and its meaning for the citizen. Programs of
school tours have been expanded. The number of children on escorted
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 11

tours has grown from less than 25,000 in 1967 to about 75,000 this
year and our corps of volunteer docents has tripled in size. The
experimental development of a neighborhood museum in Anacostia
has shown that museum-like operations may be carried out in the
crucible of the inner city, that children may learn with delight and
advantage, and that the residents of the area will treat with respect
what they regard as their own center for learning and recreation.

We have held annual conferences on the use of museums as
educational resources. Through our membership organization, the
Smithsonian Society of Associates, more people may participate far
more directly in the offerings of our museums such as popular study
and craft courses, special events, and guided field trips. In 1968 we
commissioned the first general survey of visitors to our museums.
Much more, needless to say, remains to be done, but unless museums
ask of themselves what their visitors have learned they will have no
way to gauge their effectiveness. Internal dissatisfaction with the
educational impact of our exhibits is healthy and serves to increase
our determination to improve them.

A well-informed public is the best source of constructive criticism,
which we encourage to insure that the Institution does not become
insulated from the public it serves.

We have changed the annual report from a collection of articles
written by others, often interesting but not informative about the
Institution itself, into a full and detailed statement about all of our
activities, the publications of staff members, the results of research,
and the expenditure of funds—full disclosure, if you will—in a manner
intended to allow any reader of the report to form his own opinion
of our effectiveness and objectives. We have established a public
information office to facilitate inquiries from external sources. We
have had numerous activities reviewed by ad hoc committees drawn
from outside the Institution. We have encouraged visits by Members
of Congress and others to become informed about the Institution. An
example that comes to mind was an evening open house in 1965 to
which we invited the entire Congress to view the exhibits presented
in the National Museum of History and Technology. Our new
magazine Smithsonian, mentioned earlier, will function as an educa-
tional benefit of membership in the Society of Associates and also
serve the vital function of helping to inform the public about the pur-
poses and operations of the Institution.

With the increase in responsibilities and higher performance stand-
ards has come a need for strengthened management. To enter per-
sonnel and payroll information or address lists on our computer was
12 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

an obvious step, but one which took some years of intensive effort.
We have created the office of General Counsel for the first time in the
Institution’s history and constituted the office of the Treasurer at the
senior level. Service divisions have been brought into closer relation
with the units they support. Here is another area where our own
dissatisfaction with ourselves is the surest safeguard of the public
interest. In a period of complex growth we may have given insuffi-
cient attention to certain kinds of procedures simply because they
showed less sign of strain. I have been enormously pleased by the
cooperation we have received from the Office of Management and
Budget, the Civil Service Commission, the General Accounting Office,
the General Services Administration, this and other Committees of
the Congress, and a host of helpful advisors. We need all the help
we can get.

At the same time, technical procedures are no substitute for a
shared and intense dedication to the public good, through a system
of management wherein management responsibility is vested in the
very best people one can find, operating with clear warrants to seek
and produce the best results attainable. We have sought to develop a
concept of shared responsibility rather than to second-guess our
bureau and program directors up an endless hierarchy. I have been
strongly concerned about the quality of our decision-making and have
sought ways to create shared judgments through the establishment
of our Secretariat (meeting weekly) and council of bureau directors
(meeting monthly).

One of the most important aspects of our programs is its interna-
tional character. The pathways followed by knowledge and culture
do not observe national boundaries. The quality of research, collec-
tion development, and education cannot be maintained without regard
to the work of kindred institutions overseas, just as our investigations
must be prosecuted around the globe. We inaugurated a major program
in 1965 to apply excess currencies to the needs of scholarship arid
field research abroad in continuation of the original efforts of Joseph
Henry. We created an Office of International Activities to foster
cooperation with scholars and institutions in other nations, aided by
a Travel Services Office to help staff members in their overseas
pursuits. The effects of this renewed international emphasis in our
programs of education, conservation, and research have been salu-
tary, and have included 219 grants to 57 American institutions and
universities for foreign research using counterpart funds.

The establishment of the Woodrow Wilson International Center
for Scholars is perhaps a further realization of the Congress’ recogni-
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 13

tion of the Smithsonian’s international role. The tragic failures of
international understanding which so mar the recent history of our
world surely call for a redoubling of effort by all institutions to seek
to increase international understanding through scholarly exchanges
and cooperation.

We have attempted to be mindful of our responsibilities as an
establishment in a troubled urban area, through services to schools
and the Anacostia neighborhood experiment. The annual Festival
of American Folklife serves as an example of an inspiring presenta-
tion that appeals to young and old alike. Groups that confront one
another angrily in other settings enjoy the experience of a common
heritage side by side. I believe it is incumbent upon the Smithsonian
to take seriously its obligations as a good citizen of the District of
Columbia and to be increasingly mindful of a public service respon-
sibility to educational and governmental programs underway here.

Another objective of management, which has become increasingly
well established, is to maintain strong cooperative links to those pro-
grams of major government agencies that the Smithsonian can assist
as a performer of research or provider of services. The Satellite
Tracking Program conducted on behalf of Nasa by our Astro-
physical Observatory is a noteworthy instance, or the scientific ad-
visory services we provided the Corps of Engineers regarding pollu-
tion in New York Harbor. We have assisted the Atlantic-Pacific
Interoceanic Sea Level Canal Commission in ecological studies related
to plans for a new sea-level canal. The Fish and Wildlife Service
and the Bureau of Sport Fisheries, as well as the Geological Survey
and entomology division of the Department of Agriculture, are alloted
office space and collection storage facilities in the Natural History
Building. Cooperative projects offer an excellent format for the
attainment of timely or urgent objectives without our having to build
a permanent staff which might outlive the aims of the program
under which they had been drawn together.

In all this, planning is of the utmost importance. Growth must
be brought into effective relation to the availability of resources,
especially for an establishment such as ours with more than forty line
items in our federal budget, each of which could very readily be
expanded to meet some external or internal need. We recently
constituted an executive steering committee of our Secretariat to
guide the development of the planning function within the Institu-
tion and consider ways to maintain a balance between our pattern
of commitments and the resources we may expect. It was my judg-
ment in 1964 that the Institution would have to inaugurate some
14 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

new programs and achieve order-of-magnitude increases in some
support activities in order to function successfully for the 1970s, and
to be judged worthy of more financial support from the Congress
and private sources. While we have had some very considerable
success much remains to be done. In 1964, our federal budget was
able to meet only 70 percent of basic research and support needs.
Now it meets more than 90 percent, but the elimination of remaining
shortages is a priority objective in planning. What then could be
said of our plans for the next decade?

The central concerns of the Smithsonian represent national needs
for the kind of sustained commitment that can be made only by an
institution with a strong sense of continuity, tradition, and concen-
trated purpose. We believe that our first responsibility is to continue
the general lines of endeavor to which my predecessors, with the
support of the Congress, have committed the Institution: basic
research in selected areas of national interest; development and main-
tenance of the national collections in biology, anthropology, history,
and the arts; and enlightenment of the public through exhibitions
and related activities.

In all this an overriding concern should continue to be the quality
of the professional staff effort within the Smithsonian and, I cannot
too strongly emphasize, the achievement of an adequate level of
support of that effort. We have repeatedly appealed to the President
and Congress to remedy deficiencies in support of research and
scholarly programs. While virtually half of the growth in appropria-
tions since 1964 has been devoted to staffing and operating new
facilities authorized by the Congress, an equal effort has been made
to sustain the basic scholarly program: support for fieldwork, instru-
ments, libraries and again libraries, automatic data processing, im-
proved personnel procedures, technician support, related higher edu-
cation activities, better access to colleagues through scholarly publish-
ing, and unremitting emphasis on the professional character of staff
appointments, all against a background of increasing costs. Much
remains to be done on this score. We are now documenting the
character and extent of these support shortages in even greater detail
for the President’s budget in the future. Our budget henceforth will
proceed on two tracks, the first a phased elimination of these short-
ages and the second to provide for the continued development of
programs entrusted to us by the Congress.

There are a number of courses we should avoid. We repeatedly
decline requests to assume responsibilities which we believe to be
too extensive. The Institution is an establishment, somewhat akin to
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 10S)

a university or research academy, not a public program agency with
massive national operations, field offices, or extensive granting pro-
grams. For example, it was once suggested that the Institution
assume management of international educational and cultural ex-
changes funded by the government, but we could not agree. The
Board of Regents has followed a consistent policy against distant
museum operations such as regional museums or national museums
in cities other than the Capital. Professor Henry’s principle, that
the Smithsonian should not bear responsibilities that others are will-
ing to assume, still applies today. While cooperating with universi-
ties we should not seek to assume their distinctive functions of gen-
eral instruction or degree-granting. While cooperating with museums
elsewhere we should not interpose this Institution in their relations
with one another or with the national government.

Without infringing on the autonomy of our bureaus and their
distinctive objectives we shall seek the advantages of existence as a
community of scholars where scientists and scholars learn from one
another. Whether by tracing biochemical relations from one group
of organisms to another or studying the behavior of a group of verte-
brates first in the tropics and then in the setting of the zoo, followed
with close anatomical and distributional studies in museum collec-
tions, we benefit from association with our colleagues. Similarly
scholars working with portraits, genre painting, lithographs, and
historical objects can pursue together their mutual interests in the
documents of the American past. Our desire to maintain unity of
outlook and professional endeavor suggests that the Smithsonian
should always avoid program developments that do not in some way
reinforce some of our other activities.

The museum as an institution in society is one focus for Smith-
sonian concern; the other focus is on the vigorous prosecution of
lines of study which, if left to themselves, would not receive the
attention that the national interest requires. Sometimes we move
beyond the museum setting to develop laboratory investigations.
When we constitute a museum it is with due emphasis upon its
scholarly responsibilities in adding to the store of man’s knowledge.
These two foci of concern should continue to determine the Smith-
sonian’s course, rather as two points generate an ellipse: neither
museums without scholarship nor scholarship without concern for
communicating with the public at large, but as in the beginning the
increase and the diffusion of knowledge.

Beginning this year the observance of the bicentennial of the
American Revolution will become a predominant factor in the devel-
16 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

opment of Smithsonian programs. Within the settings of our history
and art museums members of the public may seek a reappraisal of
our national experience with due reference to its international setting.
Fresh insights of historians should be interwoven with superb offer-
ings of objects and art works that portray our nation’s course over the
past two centuries and suggest paths for our continued development.

From the studies of the sources of energy and means for its use by
living systems to the explanation of biological diversity, the Smith-
sonian represents an unexcelled multidisciplinary array of information
resources and professional scientists which bear upon critical needs to
improve our understanding of the physical environment upon which
human society depends. We anticipate increasing demands upon our
efforts in systematic biology, anthropology, astrophysics, and environ-
mental studies as important resources for the national effort in environ-
mental improvement.

One of the most important unfulfilled hopes for the Smithsonian is
that a great national museum might be developed on the authorized
space on the Mall between Fourth and Seventh Streets along Inde-
pendence Avenue to recreate the experience of man’s greatest
adventure: flight and space exploration. We also aspire to present
insights about the significance of the space age for everyday life and
to communicate an understanding of the scientific discoveries originat-
ing from space exploration. Thus we are coming to appreciate that
it is not only machines, or relics of the past, or evidences of the skills
of craftsmen that concern us, but man himself. Thus we propose also
to continue to study the idea of a museum of man which could per-
haps convey something of the ever-widening insight into man and
society that characterizes the progress of knowledge today.

The birthright of today’s citizen is an understanding of the forces
shaping himself and his world. It is to museums that many people
look for access to the works of artists, an appreciation of the past,
an awareness of the scientific view of nature, and for portents of the
future. All museums must experiment with new techniques of exhibi-
tion and embark upon research aimed at improving their effectiveness
in popular education. The quality of our response to this democratic
vista will continue to be a matter of overriding concern to the Smith-
sonian in years to come.

From the amassing of great national collections will arise difficult
questions about how to guarantee access to the information they
contain. This will call for innovative designs of indexes, catalogs,
and ways to manage vast resources of information. Perhaps some
of the techniques developed for the management of voluminous flows
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 17

of data from satellite observations or oceanographic stations may be
adapted to the needs of the future. If man is not to be engulfed by a
rising tide of reports, paper, data, computer printout, and memora-
bilia, organizations such as the Smithsonian must pioneer in winnow-
ing and selecting this material from the spate of messages that now fill
the communications channels of our advanced technological civiliza-
tion. I wonder if the Smithsonian does not occupy a salient or point
of vantage from which this concern figures very prominently. In our
role as custodian of the nation’s collections we must try to serve the
public interest in improved management of scientific and scholarly
information.

In eras of decisive historical change all institutions undergo trials:
the challenge of changes in purpose, efforts to adapt to changing cir-
cumstances, and perhaps even lapses of confidence from within or
without. This is a time of testing and trial for the university, for the
museum, indeed, for our society as a whole. The Smithsonian is not
immune from searching inquiry into its objectives and character.
Without such inquiry and without audacious questioning of any of
our comfortable suppositions, the Smithsonian would lose its value to
the people and to future generations. Every institution must be recep-
tive to change, to new patterns of communication, to the concerns of
new groupings in society, and to new expectations.

If the Smithsonian is to deepen its services to our society we must
continue to strengthen our administrative structure, to seek new
sources of support, to enlist men and women of principle and insight
as officers and staff members, and to hold our performance to ever
higher standards of quality and meaningfulness. I would submit that
the Institution must increase its ability to adapt to changing circum-
stances, shifting patterns of public needs, widening horizons of leader-
ship within the Congress and the Executive Branch. We are confident
that only in this way can we strengthen the Institution to meet the
future of the decade.

BOARD OF REGENTS

The first of a newly scheduled fall meeting of the Board of
Regents was held on 5 November 1969 at the National Zoological
Park. Such additional meetings are planned in order to give the
Regents an opportunity to consider a series of presentations on the
various programs of the Institution. Emphasis at this meeting was
on the National Zoological Park. Talks were given by Dr. Theodore
Reed on the status of Zoo construction and by Dr. John Eisenberg
concerning the Ceylon-Smithsonian elephant research program.
18 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

The Regents had an opportunity to visit a number of the Zoo
buildings, including the bird house where arrangements had been
made to exhibit the moonrock from the Apollo 11 mission. Also on
exhibit was the Crown-of-Thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci), cur-
rently the subject of research into its effect on coral reefs, particularly
in the Pacific Ocean.

The winter meeting of the Board of Regents was held at Hillwood,
the estate of Mrs. Marjorie Merriweather Post, on 28 January 1970.
Chief Justice Warren E. Burger had been elected earlier by mail
ballot as Chancellor of the Smithsonian Institution. It was recognized
that Mr. Thomas J. Watson, Jr., had been designated a Regent by
Public Law 91-30, dated 17 June 1969.

The actions of the Board were reported in a statement released to
the Press, which is summarized as follows:

Plans for a Smithsonian monthly magazine were approved. The Board
approved a study of the advisability of establishing a unified investment pro-
gram for the Institution’s private endowments. This program, if ultimately
adopted, would not involve any transfer of collections, capital funds, or income
from any existing fund to any other. The Board expressed satisfaction with the
Institution’s plans for improvement of operating procedures and of the internal
auditing of its financial affairs.

The spring meeting of the Board of Regents was held in the Freer
Gallery of Art on 20 May 1970. The Chancellor welcomed Vice Presi-
dent Spiro T. Agnew to the meeting of the Board and also welcomed
the new Regent, Mr. James E. Webb, whose appointment was
approved by Public Law 91-255 on 18 May 1970.

In addition to discussing matters of policy, programs, legislation,
and finances, the Regents elected Regent James E. Webb to be a
Member of the Executive Committee (Permanent Committee). The
Board approved the Secretary’s recommendation that Assistant Secre-
tary James Bradley be appointed to the position of Under Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution.

At the conclusion of the meeting the Chancellor, on behalf of the
Board of Regents and the Secretary, presented a scroll to Mrs. Agnes
E. Meyer for her more than fifty years of devotion and service to the
Freer Gallery of Art.

FINANCIAL REPORT

During the fiscal year ending 30 June 1970 private and federal fund
finances continued to be adversely affected by inflationary conditions
and the need to maintain vital commitments within a framework of
restricted income support.
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 19

Sources of financial support for our operating expenses in fiscal
year 1970 as compared with fiscal year 1969 are as follows:

Federal appropriations FY (1970 FY 1969
Salaries and Expenses—operating funds $29,965,000 $26,443,000
Special Foreign Currency Program 2,316,000 2,316,000

District of Columbia—operations of the National Zoo 2,802,000 2,528,000
Research grants and contracts (federal and private) 10,600,000 11,400,000
Private funds
Gifts (excluding gifts to endowment funds; 2,000,000 1,987,000
entire amount restricted to specific
projects and hence unavailable for
general operating expenses)

Income from endowments and current fund 1,400,000 1,365,000
investments
Total $49,083,000 $46,039,000

In addition, federal appropriations to finance construction projects
were received as follows:

BY. 1970 Fy 1969

National Zoological Park $ 600,000 $ 300,000
Restoration and renovation of buildings 525,000 400,000
Toward construction of the Joseph H. 3,500,000 2,000,000
Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden
Total $4,625,000 $2,700,000

Federal Operating Funds

As may be seen above, the federal appropriations provided by
Congress for fiscal year 1970 totaled $29,965,000, including supple-
mental appropriations arising from federally legislated wage and salary
increases during the year. This was 13 percent more than the $26,443,-
000 provided in fiscal year 1969. An 11 percent increase was received
through the District of Columbia to provide for operations of the
National Zoo. Support for the Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program,
however, was continued at the same level as in the previous year,
namely, $2,316,000; these funds are used to administer a program
of grants to more than fifty museums and universities in the United
States for the purpose of carrying on research in the related foreign
currency countries.

The increase in the federal appropriation is indeed beneficial. It
must be realized, however, that nearly two thirds of the increase
granted is required to cover merely the two salary increases plus the
20 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

wage scale adjustment legislated by Congress in fiscal year 1970. Most
of the remainder of the increase is required to cover the mounting cost
of goods and services in this inflationary period. Yet on top of provid-
ing for these expanded costs the Smithsonian has been in the position
during the past year of carrying out a number of important prior
commitments including the transfer of the Radiation Biology Labora-
tory to new quarters; stepped-up preparations for the future opening
of the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden; funding of a por-
tion of the requirements of the Archives of American Art which be-
came a part of the Smithsonian this year; and support for the newly
formed Center for Short-Lived Phenomena, a program which is
attracting worldwide attention in the scientific community. Providing
for these new requirements while at the same time trying to meet
the legitimate demands for expansion of our long-established activities
to absorb, for example, new national biological or mineralogical collec-
tions, to intensify research in the growing fields of ecology and
oceanography, simply could not be carried out in a manner which
would be satisfactory to all parties within the limitations of the funds
available. Financial planning, furthermore, was made all the more
difficult by the fact that the Congressional appropriations for fiscal
year 1970 were not voted until more than three months after the
beginning of the year. The result is that there is no question that
many of our departments and projects are suffering shortages, par-
ticularly since the current year stringencies merely add to those which
have been growing over the past several years.

Under these circumstances, the Institution has embarked on a
thorough analysis of all federally supported activities with the aim of
reducing or eliminating activities that are of a lower priority or have
become marginal. This will do much to reallocate our resources so
that high-priority programs can be supported more adequately. There
should be a reflection of this study in our next year’s disbursements
and in our request for Congressional appropriations for fiscal year

1972.

Research, Grants, and Contracts

As shown above, grants and contracts awarded to the Smithsonian
in fiscal year 1970 declined from those of the previous year. Primarily
this reflected cutbacks by Nasa, especially for the satellite-tracking
program at our Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory. The full
extent of these cutbacks will not be realized until fiscal year 1971.
They have, however, caused a drastic reduction in forces at the
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY Zi

Observatory. At the same time the tight money conditions affecting
the government granting agencies have been further evidenced by
delays in contract payments and advances. This in turn has forced the
Smithsonian to increase its working capital investment in these con-
tracts by over $1,000,000 in the past twelve months, severely reducing
our cash balances.

Private Operating Funds

Financial statements for the private funds, as audited by independ-
ent public accountants, are shown in Appendix 9, page 212. While
the squeeze on funds in the federal funds sector has been severe, it is
in the private funds area that the most difficulty has been experienced
during fiscal year 1970. Income from endowment funds and from cur-
rent investments increased only slightly, yet costs were affected by the
same inflationary influences, particularly the need to match for our
privately funded employees the increase in salaries and wages given
federally funded employees.

Income from the Institution’s endowment funds and current invest-
ments is largely dedicated to restricted purposes. The Freer Gallery,
for example, received nearly half of the total endowment fund income
in fiscal year 1970, with other restricted funds taking an additional
one-quarter. Thus, the total unrestricted private-fund income from
endowments and current fund investments amounted to only about
$340,000 for the year, and this must be largely used to.buttress our
shortages on the federal side, a most unfair strain on these resources.

Disbursements of private unrestricted funds exceeded this income
by more than $1,000,000 in fiscal year 1970. The largest single factor
in this result was the start-up expenses relating to our new Smithsonian
magazine. It is expected that a good portion of these unusual start-up
costs may be recovered from private donations from those interested
in the Smithsonian’s effort to widen greatly its educational efforts.
For the future, furthermore, there are present indications that the new
magazine and membership program will be able to pay their own way.
The cost of subsidizing other private-fund activities, notably the
Smithsonian Institution Press and the Division of Performing Arts,
also rose substantially during the past year. Thus the combined costs
of magazine start-up and subsidies to the various activities were well
in excess of unrestricted private-fund income and produced the large
loss of funds previously referred to. This loss in the operating account,
together with the tying up of an additional $1,000,000 of unrestricted
funds in the carrying out of grant and contract projects, acted to
22 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

reduce cash balances severely. The cash position was restored at year
end by the influx of magazine subscription monies. Other cash drains,
hopefully less severe than those of fiscal year 1970, may be experienced
for temporary periods in the future.

As in the case of federal funds, strong efforts are now being made
to prevent a recurrence of deficits in the private-fund sector. Expenses
are being reduced where possible with the elimination of low-priority
projects or the release of employees. At the same time, increasing
management attention is being given to our revenue-producing
activities such as the Museum Shops, the Press, and the Division of
Performing Arts. At year end a restudy of our entire accounting system
was being carried out to permit improved management reports and
possibly less costly fiscal operations in the future.

Finally, the groundwork has been laid for a major fund-raising
effort through the establishment in September 1969 of a Development
Office, and the subsequent launching of our Smithsonian Associates
national membership campaign. Through these efforts we plan to
raise sufficient funds to complete our purchase program for the
Chesapeake Bay Center and certain other immediate needs; over the
next five- to ten-year period it is hoped that unrestricted endowment
funds can be increased very substantially to restore a better balance
between private-fund and federal-fund support. As Joseph Henry
pointed out years ago, our private funds must be protected in order
to accomplish our goals of research and instruction and not used, like
plugs in a dyke, to underwrite gaps in our federal support.

A separate but major fund-raising activity is also being undertaken
on behalf of the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Design and Decorative
Arts. Several million dollars will be required within the next few
years to allow this museum to complete the renovation of the
Carnegie Mansion in New York City to become the new home for
the Cooper-Hewitt collections and art courses.

Gifts Received

The Smithsonian continued during the year to be most fortunate
in attracting substantial donations for specific purposes related to its
established fields of activity. The most outstanding have been two
gifts totaling $6,000,000 to support an expanded program of under-
water oceanography. The donors wish to remain anonymous, but we
are pleased to express again here our deep appreciation.

In addition, gifts for current projects were received in the amount
of $2,000,000. Our program for the purchase of additional land areas
STATEMENT BY THE SECRETARY 23

at our Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Sciences has made
excellent progress thanks to $575,000 of contributions from the Richard
K. Mellon Foundation, the Scaife Foundation, Old Dominion Founda-
tion, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Laurel Foundation, and
Prospect Hill Foundation. For these and for the host of other gifts
by persons and organizations we are deeply grateful.

Endowment Funds

The addition of the $6,000,000 of oceanographic support funds,
the bequest of $291,000 from the George F. Becker estate for the
advancement of geophysics, and the transfer of about $30,000 in
endowment funds of the Archives of American Art, raised the book
value of our total endowment funds to $32,600,000 as of 30 June
1970. The market value of these funds, has, of course, been severely
affected by the sharp decline in stock values during the past year;
income from the funds, however, has continued to increase, albeit
slowly; total value at year end was approximately $33,000,000.

ii THERE IS A COMMON BOND OF INTEREST among all the activities of
the Smithsonian Institution—Science, History, Art, the Humanities
—it is a common concern with development, the development of
human behavior (as shown in man’s response to his physical and socio-
logical environment, and historically, as shown by his artifacts and pro-
ductivity) and the development of nonhuman organisms and their re-
lationship to their environment, both terrestrial and cosmic. The his-
tory and development of natural phenomena and the characterization
of natural events as an indirect influence on these developments fills
out our sphere of interest in a way that is most likely to provide us
with an understanding of man and his universe.

Within the scientific portion of this sphere, the activities of the
Smithsonian Institution are focused primarily on what may properly
be called natural history. This term, once pejorative, encompasses a
breadth of interest now recognized as necessary to an understanding of
our total environment. We are attempting to elucidate the interrela-
tionships between whole organisms, communities, and populations
with the physical, chemical, and geological factors which play a role in
the total ecology of the earth, now and in past ages. We are concerned
also with the impact on these relationships of extraterrestrial phenom-
ena. Ionizing and non-ionizing radiation and solar effects are perhaps
the most easily recognized. Astrophysical investigations which in their
purest form consist of theoretical physics and mathematics are carried
out in attempts to explain the mechanics of the universe. The contri-
bution to our knowledge from these investigations, moreover, helps us
to understand the geophysical events on earth that in turn improve
our understanding of their effects on living systems over time and
space. We hope that by moving on a broad intellectual front we can
take advantage of all new techniques and information gained through
a naturally related group of disciplines. The Smithsonian Institution
is fortunate and perhaps unique in having this range of competence
and in being sufficiently free of specificly assigned “missions” that we
can permit ourselves this broad goal.

30 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

National Museum of Natural History

Research projects continued or concluded; plans were evolved and
carried out; expeditions departed and returned; collections were loaned
and received again; but it was not a year of “business as usual.” These
and countless other activities were accomplished against a background
fabric of increasing tension, woven of uncertainties. If ivory towers
existed here earlier, they have long since crumbled, spilling their occu-
pants into the midst of the concerns that involve us all. During the
year a number of the staff participated in radio programs and
television presentations designed to increase awareness of the great
national issues and to provide a free, open forum for discussion of
them by the citizenry.

Decreasing resources in the past few years for carrying forward
research-curation-education programs in the Museum became a major
preoccupation in the latter half of the year. Reductions in “buying
power,” caused by near-level funding, inflation, and general pay raises,
have been met in recent years by progressive reorganization in many
of the Museum departments (resulting in greater efficiency of opera-
tions), but also by unfortunate postponements of expenditures. Unless
relief is provided, the present slowing of progress in the increase and
diffusion of knowledge of the natural world and in the care of the
national collections will be further evidenced in the years ahead.

In spite of such difficulties, it was a year characterized by a large
volume of research publications, some of which received national at-
tention by special awards, and the continued evolution of interdisci-
plinary, interdepartmental investigations that reflect the deepening
relevancy of the natural sciences to today’s troubled world. Although
it was a productive period, only the most significant accomplishments
can be recorded in the following pages.

Only a portion of the funds ordinarily allotted to the Office of Sys-
tematics was actually available, but partial support was provided,
among other things, for initiating two experimental behavior projects,
for assisting with the further development of electronic data-processing
applications in the Museum, and to stage the annual Summer Insti-
tute in Systematics. This year’s Institute brought together botanical
and zoological systematists to discuss the full panoply of systematic
biology, with joint sponsorship of the American Society of Plant

Taxonomists and the Society of Systematic Zoology.

RESEARCH

Within days after the beginning of the new fiscal year, millions of
television viewers saw the first footprint in the surface dust of the
moon. In the Department of Mineral Sciences, after many years of
research on randomly acquired extraterrestrial rocks—meteorites—
the sight of the astronauts bagging the first lunar rocks had a signifi-
cance even beyond that for most viewers. Now, the preceding man-
years of thought, training, and experimentation were to be put to the
ultimate challenge of elucidating the history and evolution of the
moon from these samples.

Preparations to meet this challenge have been steadily accelerated
in recent years by the addition of staff and equipment, and by the
intensive investigation of possible meteoritic and terrestrial analogs
of lunar materials. Techniques for sampling and sectioning such rare
and unique specimens have been carefully developed in this depart-
ment. Indeed, the first member of our team to actually handle the
Apollo 11 collections was chief preparator Grover C, Moreland, who
was called upon by the National Aeronautics and Space Administra-
tion to oversee the sectioning laboratory at the Lunar Receiving Lab-
oratory, and who made some of the first sections after the rocks were
released from quarantine. Samples of Apollo 11 materials were re-
ceived at the Museum in mid-September, and since then virtually
everyone in the department has been actively involved in this inte-
grated research effort. Samples from the Apollo 12 mission began
arriving in April and are still being received. Thanks to the breadth of
our scientific capability, we have been able to plan and execute a truly
comprehensive investigation of the lunar materials—their chemical
and mineralogical composition, and the interpretation of these data—
to provide a tentative account of their petrologic history and evolu-
tion.

Although the samples we received were small (totaling less than an
ounce), we were able to extract from them a remarkable variety of
rock and mineral fragments. Among these was a unique object, a small
metallic spheroid four millimeters in diameter. It evidently formed as
a droplet of nickel-iron from a metallic meteorite which crashed on the
moon. The surface of this spheroid is spotted with small craters, the
product of impacts of lunar particles traveling at supersonic velocities.
In its shape and surface features it mimics the moon itself, so we have
called it our “mini-moon.” A photograph of this object was chosen
for the front cover of the issue of Science (30 January 1970) devoted
to the initial reports on the Apollo 11 investigations.

On 27 April, Dr. Edward P. Henderson, who led the departmental
39 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

team’s study of the “mini-moon,” received the National Academy of
Sciences’ Lawrence Smith Medal for nearly forty years of distinguished
contributions to meteorite research.

The study of the microscopic anatomy of bone has the potential of
providing valuable metabolic data on human skeletal populations, and
has led to new areas of research, such as the ecological influences on
bone metabolism in two or more populations. There are two fun-
damental facts that allow bone biology to be used in studies of life
processes: (1) Although the primary function of bone is structural, it
is also importantly involved in metabolic processes by providing a
source of calcium and phosphate; and (2) living bone responds to both
structural and physiological stresses by a continuous process of re-
modeling. Because bone microstructure follows a developmental se-
quence during the entire life of an individual, it can provide a most
useful means for studying aging and disease. Recent studies of polished

A nickel-iron spheroid, 4 mm in diameter, from the Apollo 11 material, which
epitomizes much of lunar history. A meteorite crashed into the moon, being
melted by the impact and producing a rain of liquid droplets, of which this is
one. It has been abraded by lunar dust and struck by high-velocity lunar par-
ticles, producing the remarkable craters on its surface.
SCIENCE 33

thin sections of tibia bones of normal, diseased, and alcoholic individ-
uals demonstrated statistically significant differences between the
normal and abnormal bone.

Comparative studies of fossil organisms and their modern counter-
parts continue to be a fruitful approach to understanding paleo-ecol-
ogy, functional morphology, and ultimately the evolutionary relation-
ships upon which a valid classification can be erected. Among numer-
ous staff contributions to our knowledge of the evolution of fossil
Recent groups, an especially important one was concerned with the
radiation of Cenozoic planktonic Foraminifera. Through analysis of
morphotypic groups, rather than through the traditional taxa, it was
shown that the planktonic Foraminifera underwent two major radia-
tions during the Cenozoic. The first began in the Paleocene, was com-
pleted by Eocene, and ended with extinction of all groups except the
globigerines by Oligocene. The second radiation began in the Miocene
and the groups evolved are still extant. Distribution patterns of the
radiation were repetitive; in both cases similar complex morphotypic
groups appeared while the simpler globigerine group persisted
throughout the Cenozoic. By analogy with studies of planktonic Fo-
raminifera in modern oceans over a period of years, it was concluded
that the repetitive patterns are probably due to major changes in the
structure of water masses during the Cenozoic.

Investigations of living invertebrate animals involved principally
aquatic organisms, both marine and freshwater groups. The comple-
tion of a monograph on the entocytherid ostracods of Mexico and
Cuba is noteworthy because the entocytherids occur in association
with crayfishes, and an understanding of their distribution patterns, as
well as those of their crayfish hosts, and of the ecological interrelation-
ships of both groups are required for an understanding of the orgin and
evolution of these common freshwater animals.

The littorinid snails, common inhabitants of the intertidal zone,
were the subject of another monograph completed during the year;
part one included the subfamily Littorininae in the Indo-Pacific
region. Basic information on this widely distributed group had been
scattered in the literature and was not generally available to the
nonspecialist. The author combined a literature survey, studies of old
collections, and extensive field work to produce a work that will be the
standard reference for malacologists and ecologists interested in the
organisms of the intertidal zone.

A museum is not only a place in which scientists study preserved
specimens, but also where it is entirely possible to conduct valuable
research on living plants and animals. Although the facilities required
are still very limited, behavioral studies are underway on two major
34. SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

groups of vertebrate animals. Earlier systematic investigations of
many fish groups were based exclusively on morphological and, to a
lesser extent, on anatomical data. Aquaria are now in operation in the
Museum for studying the behavior of some of the smaller fishes with
the hope that it may provide additional systematic characteristics to
differentiate species.

Similar observations are being made on locomotion in frogs, based
on anatomical and skeletal materials and on controlled experiments
with living amphibians. Jumping and climbing adaptations are re-
ceiving particular attention by the use of motion-picture analysis, on
the assumption that different species will have not only structural
differences but behavioral ones as well.

Botanical research spanned highly diverse projects, from floristics to
cytology, monographs to evolutionary anatomy. Geographically, there
is still a preponderance of concern for the plants of the tropics; contri-
butions were completed or greatly advanced for floras of Venezuela,
Costa Rica and Panama, Ceylon, Mexico, Santa Catarina (Brazil),
Dominica, and the islands of the Pacific.

The temperate latitudes were not neglected, for the Flora North
America Project, midway in its planning phase, will bring a new era
to floristic research and practice. Although the program is administra-
tively centered at the Smithsonian, North American botanists gener-
ally are cooperating in a massive long-term effort, aimed at bringing
together existing knowledge of the flowering plants of this continent in
an encyclopedic, computerized data bank. The existence of such a data
base has obvious, direct application to current and future ecologic
research for environmental enhancement, but it could also provide
printouts of floras of the whole continent or any part of it in the fu-
ture. The National Science Foundation granted funds to the American
Institute of Biological Sciences for support of the project development,
particularly the employment of a highly qualified systems develop-
ment manager.

The usefulness of plant anatomy for defining evolutionary pathways
is unquestionable, but an especially valuable example was published
during the year. Because there is scanty fossil evidence for one or the
other view of the origin and evolution of flower form and structure,
much of the thinking has been speculative and at times highly con-
troversial. The origin of the inferior ovary, for example, has been
assumed by most botanists to have occurred evolutionarily from the
superior ovary by adnation of surrounding flower parts. A recent
anatomical study of the floral anatomy of one of the Ginseng family
showed, among other things, that the ovary in this group of plants has
SCIENCE 35

undergone an evolutionary reversal from the inferior to the superior
position, a reversal never previously reported in any plant family.

In spite of considerable loss of time for moving back into the
Museum, the Department of Entomology and associated Department
of Agriculture entomologists are again housed with the rest of the
natural sciences, and research continued at a high level. The sixth and
seventh volumes of a long-term study of Edward Meyrick’s types at
the British Museum were published this year. Meyrick was a very
prolific describer of new species and genera of microlepidoptera; but
because he failed to provide either adequate descriptions or illustra-
tions, it has been almost impossible to place his taxa in modern sys-
tems of classification. This multivolume work is an invaluable asset to
systematic entomologists, including as it does original references, rede-
scriptions, and photographs of the wings and genitalia.

In addition to numerous individual research efforts, a departmental
project on the biosystematics of Ceylonese insects was initiated with a
grant of excess-currency funds and the approval of the cosponsoring
National Museums of Ceylon and other government agencies. The first
field party carried out life history studies, obtained behavioral and
ecological data, and returned after three months with 150,000 speci-
mens. The Ceylon project affords the opportunity to broaden the
similar studies that have been carried out in the New World tropics in
past years. The Ceylonese will benefit by receiving ecological and life
history information, and identified specimens that will have great

potential significance for improvements in agriculture and_ public
health.

COLLECTIONS

Specimens, samples of the natural world, are biological standards,
the documentation for what we know about the kinds of organisms
now and in the geologic past, their geographic distribution, their vari-
ability, and their evolutionary history. Together with the literature of
more than two hundred years, collections are the basic tool without
which systematic biology may not proceed soundly.

There is a growing awareness now that these standards are also
critical for any ecological research aimed at improving environmental
quality. Collections and their associated data permit serious considera-
tion of restoring quality because they provide the most authoritative
information on what grew where and when and under what conditions.
And so the national collections of natural history objects continue, as
they must, to increase, but under restraints that assure the most sig-
36 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

nificant additions. For example, one need only review the large
growth-areas—mammals and insects. As a part of a much larger pro-
gram, 7,500 small mammals were collected by a staff team in Morocco
along with data on habitat preferences, reproductive biology, food
habits, and their ectoparasites. Nearly 100,000 collections of water
beetles were made by one staff researcher during the year in support of
his project to understand the biology of these pollution-indicator
organisms. Collections are rarely purchased, and then they must meet
very exacting criteria. The largest museum collection is not perforce
the best, and even with adequate space and _ technical assistance,
neither of which is more than minimal, a high degree of organiza-
tional skill and judgment is required to meet problems of caring for
such large numbers of collections.

The concept of a centralized specimen-processing laboratory, first
implemented by the anthropologists, has now been adopted in other
departments as resources and attitudes permit. In March the Herbari-
um Services Unit was established by the botanists with one of their
number serving as the first supervisor for all the technical assistants.
The entomologists have concentrated support services in an Entomol-
ogy Preparation Laboratory that carries on many of the curatorial
activities of the department.

While these efforts are still evolving, it is possible to be helpful to
other collections centers in such matters. In fact, one of the outstand-
ing events of the year was a cooperative training program involving
George Metcalf, supervisor of the Anthropology Processing Labora-
tory. Metcalf, who was later awarded an honorary doctorate degree by
Luther College, spent two weeks in the new Archeological Museum at
the college setting up a cataloging and accessioning system with a
group of enthusiastic students who now are able to organize the
museum’s collections.

The twin problems of collections space and curatorial assistance to
manage them must be solved if the national collections are to continue
to be useful biological standards in the future. Over the years methods
for organizing data about and from collections have been developed,
but the data are collected by hand and then made available in such
forms as cards, catalogs, and check lists. Retrieval of data in such form
is slow, inflexible, and inadequate for the kinds of research being
organized and initiated.

Given the wide availability of computers and their ability to store
and retrieve endless quantities of information, it is the responsibility of
collections managers to study the potential of this tool and chart coop-
erative programs for putting it to the service of museums and science
generally. Initial consideration must be given to the kinds and quanti-
SCIENCE 37;

ties of information the collections contain and the ways in which com-
puters can handle it. Then, agreement must be reached on a level of
effort at which to attack the volume and complexity of the potential
data base. Every precaution must be taken to assure that the data
organized at this stage are automatically transferrable to the next level
of attack where more complete information may be added later.

A three-year pilot project to initiate and test flexible, open-ended
storage and retrieval programs was concluded at the end of the year.
The results were sufficiently successful to encourage at least the
larger systematic museums to begin very deliberate cooperative plan-
ning. For highly practical reasons, the first efforts in the Museum have
been and for a time will continue to be at the level of incoming col-
lections. That is, data from new materials will be captured and stored
in the system. Retrospective capture of data from older collections will
initially be largely limited to type specimens, except as special needs
arise for which fiscal support is available.

The next step for museums is to agree among themselves on (1)
what curatorial data will be input to our common data base, (2) the
format for recording these data elements, (3) the terminology to
describe geography, geological periods, scientific names, etc., and (4)
the means by which all scientists can gain free access to the data in the
common base. The National Museum of Natural History is working
closely with the other important systematic collections centers in the
evolution of long-term, feasible plans for meeting present and future
data-transfer problems.

Within the Museum several units are already in the source data-
capturing stage with respect to newly received materials—marine
invertebrates, oceanic rocks, mammals, and sea birds. A project on the
botanical type collections is underway in the National Herbarium in
cooperation with four other major plant-collection centers. As an
example of the prospects for data-processing techniques to improve
curatorial management, the new procedures in handling paleontolog-
ical specimens involve the recording of data by machines on standard
catalog sheets at the initial processing of the incoming specimens.
Machine operation then automatically processes the data to provide
labels of two sizes, other records as needed, and then stores the data on
tape for later transfer to the data banks. The program increases the
capabilities of the supportive staff and will lessen enormous backlogs
of unprocessed specimens.

These are starts toward the long-range goal of making the collec-
tions more significant to today’s issues. If the national collections are
truly biological standards, we who are the keepers must be prepared to
discard traditional practices when they no longer adequately meet
39 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

needs. If the standards fail to provide the information needed to solve
problems, they will cease to have importance to anyone but ourselves.

EXHIBITS

Museums generally are hesitating at an exhibits crossroads; dissat-
isfaction with what exists is widespread at all levels; but the course
of other, better routes remains undefined except in general terms. With
exhibits funds already deficient, experimentaion cannot be afforded.
Consequently, very little was accomplished with respect to long-term
exhibit halls, but several temporary exhibitions of timely subjects were
presented—a photographic story of volcanoes, installation in the Life
in the Sea Hall of an aquarium containing two Crown-of-Thorns star-
fish, and a small exhibit of some of the natural history of Malaya in
celebration of Alfred Wallace’s studies in that region.

One of the more exciting events during the year was the placing on
exhibit of an incredibly large Indian tiger. This splendid gift of David
J. Hasinger of Philadelphia was beautifully mounted and prepared for
exhibition by noted taxidermist-artist Louis Jonas. The display depicts
the great cat in mid-air pursuit of a small Axis deer, and the accom-
panying labels stress the endangered-species status of the tiger.

In midyear an Air Force plane arrived in Washington with a block
of earth eight feet long, weighing about two tons. Encased within that
block are the remains of an ancient man recovered from a cave in
northern Spain last year. Handling such a block posed great problems
for the local Spanish museum, so the Smithsonian offered to apply the
proper conservation techniques as a contribution to international
science, in return for the privilege of exhibiting it for the first time.
Study and preparation are underway to put this ancient burial on
exhibit in the new year.

SCIENTIFIC SERVICES

There are at least two general ways by which scientific assistance
can be provided to the public and to other scientists. Formerly, there
was great emphasis given to the direct route, which consisted of the
staff occupying major parts of its time to provide identifications of
anything from everywhere, literally by the thousands each year. Now
there is a deliberate effort made to answer such needs on a priority
basis, depending largely on the use to which the information will be
put, and most of the scientists’ time goes into research that is designed
SCIENCE 39

to provide more and better answers to larger and more significant
questions of society.

During the past few years a population explosion of the poisonous
starfish Acanthaster planci, which feeds on living coral, has occurred
in the Pacific. These infestations were first noticed on the Great Bar-
rier Reef of Australia and have now been found at Guam as well as
other islands within the United States Trust Territory. Many square
miles of coral reefs are known to have been destroyed by this starfish.
Coral reefs not only form a living protective barrier for these islands
but also provide the foundation of the marine ecology that supports
the reef fish, the main source of protein for the residents of the islands.
This protection and food supply are now being threatened. Staff
scientists participated in surveys to determine the extent of the infesta-
tion in the Territory islands in order to obtain information needed to
plan for research into the causes of the population increase, its short-
and long-term effects on coral reefs, and to develop control measures.

The results of scientific research are not always readily useable by
nonspecialists or the layman, so semipopular/semitechnical field iden-
tification manuals are published. The Catalogue of Neotropical Squa-
mata is a good example of such service publications. Simple keys,
descriptions, synonymies, and geographic distribution in both English
and Spanish enable anyone interested in reptiles of the neotropics to

40 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

recognize species encountered in field studies and achieve some under-
standing of their biology.

Similarly, interest on the part of public and military health author-
ities in South Asia has resulted in illustrated identification manuals
to the mammals and to the snakes of Vietnam. Published by the
Smithsonian Institution Press with assistance from the Department of
Navy, both volumes are intended for the serious student rather than
the layman.

Scientists from several departments also collaborated in the prepara-
tion of material for a deck of cards on which is printed survival infor-
mation for personnel in Southeast Asia. One surface of each card
depicts in color a dangerous or useful species of animal, and the other
side gives specific points for recognition, hints for eating, if edible,
etc. The cards were produced under a contract with the Department
of Navy as a service.

National Air and Space Museum

The year 1969 witnessed the retirement of two valued and impor-
tant officials of the Museum: Director S. Paul Johnston, and Assistant
Director and Senior Historian Paul Edward Garber.

Mr. Johnston retired 31 August 1969 after serving five years as
Director. His skill at planning and organization was applied success-
fully to planning the new building to house the National Air and
Space Museum on the Mall in Washington. Several important legisla-
tive steps toward the construction of the new building were accom-
plished during his five years of service, culminating in Congressional
action authorizing the construction. Mr. Johnston organized and di-
rected well-conceived programs for preservation of the collection and
their management for research and study. The program for the selec-
tion, acquisition, and circulation of significant space craft and materi-
el, which will have far-reaching consequences for the Museum, was
instituted under Mr. Johnston’s direction. He was a dedicated advocate
of a high priority for the rapid development of the new building and
the programs of the Museum.

Mr. Garber retired 28 February 1969, after forty-nine years of ser-
vice at the Smithsonian Institution dedicated to the aircraft collection
and the National Air and Space Museum. He is widely known and
respected for his lectures and his deep knowledge of the history of
SCIENCE 4]

aircraft and flight, as well as for his success in making this history
meaningful in scholarship at all levels of education. The Muse-
um’s collection of aircraft, the most comprehensive in the world, is a
monument to his accomplishment. As a collector without equal he
performed prodigious feats of enlisting the volunteer support of the
Armed Services and many other public and private agencies in provid-
ing facilities and services for the collection when the resources of the
Smithsonian could not keep up with his success. Mr. Garber continues

his service to the Museum as a Ramsey research associate and trustee
of the Admiral and Mrs. DeWitt Clinton Ramsey Fund.

Following the policy of the past several years, the major effort of
the Preservation and Restoration Division was devoted to the mainte-
nance of the collections. The great increase in the astronautics col-
lections, however, and the demand to exhibit these artifacts through-
out the world, made it necessary to devote considerable time to restora-
tion.

The time devoted to the various types of work performed was
divided as follows: collection maintenance 50 percent, restoration 39
percent, exhibits in the Museum 8 percent, and miscellaneous services
3 percent.

Approximately 3500 new specimens were received, 85 percent of
which concerned astronautics, and 15 percent aeronautics. A total of
775 specimens were processed through inventory, identification, catalog-
ing, and warehousing.

Among the highlights of the year was the initiation of a trial series
of student seminars at the Preservation and Restoration Division with
the cooperation of the Department of Academic Programs. About 90
secondary-level students from three representative schools took part
in this program, which visually illustrated the evolution of propulsion
systems, aircraft, rockets, and space-craft by using the actual hardware
from the study collections set up and arranged for close examination
and discussion. There are now approximately 75 major specimens
from the study collection available for curatorial study, educational
programs, and the use of visiting researchers.

The Aeronautics Department was active in experimental education
projects utilizing the collection, in collaboration with the Smithsonian
Associates (“Introduction to Flight”) and the University of Maryland.
The year’s major acquisition was the Hawker Hurricane from the
Royal Air Force, in commemoration of the Battle of Britain Day,
15 September 1969.

Mr. Paul Edward Garber’s retirement further reduced the profes-
sional staff. The activities of the remaining two professionals are

limited to servicing day-to-day correspondence and short-range proj-
ects. One of the major projects during the year was the preparation,
shipment, and installation of the Lockheed Sirius aircraft in a special
exhibit building at Osaka, Japan, for Expo ’70. The aircraft is the one
in which Charles and Ann Morrow Lindbergh surveyed the Arctic air
route to the Orient.

The department has continued its program of loaning specimens
under controlled conditions beneficial to both the Museum and the
loanee. An interesting exchange brought a Packard B-12 engine into
the collection in exchange for 1300 photos of Plains Indians (obtained
through the cooperation of the National Museum of Natural History).

The Department of Astronautics has two major responsibilities: (1)
determining and authenticating the history of rockets and spaceflight,
and (2) acquiring, restoring, and exhibiting specimens.

The Museum’s research material in astronautics is probably the
largest available in the United States, and now includes the unique
reference files for the Congreve and Hale rockets plus life-saving and
whaling rockets. Historical photographs have been received and cata-

loged along with the acquisition of a sound-tape collection, from which
the “To The Moon” (Time Life Records) set of records was drawn.
Containing tapes of all manned flights through Apollo 11, this collec-
tion of more than 1500 reels is one of the largest and most complete
in the world.

Through the NAsA-Smithsonian agreement most of the Mercury
and Gemini and four of the Apollo spacecraft have come to the Muse-
um, along with some fifteen spacesuits, rocket motors, engineering
mockups, and hundreds of component parts. Loans were made during
the past year to the U. S. Information Agency, Department of Com-
merce, and Department of Labor for overseas exhibits. Expo ’70 at
Osaka, among others, displayed the Apollo 8 command module, Gem-
ini 12 spacecraft, Lunar Orbitor, spacesuits, and a Goddard rocket.
An exhibit now touring in Europe includes the Apollo 10 command
module, Gemini 10, Aldrin’s lunar visor, lunar glove, Collin’s cover-
alls, Schirra’s and Ander’s Apollo spacesuits, all from the Museum’s
collections. More than thirty tons of space artifacts were received this
year, much of which forms part of the “‘study and reference collection.”

During the Apollo 11 flight in July, both major networks used the
Arts and Industries Building for interviews and historical background,
for which purposes the building was permitted to remain open over-

night. In September nasa Administrator Thomas Paine and the
Apollo 11 astronauts presented the 1.1-pound specimen of lunar rock
to the Museum. Consequently, attendance tripled in the next months
and exceeded two million by the end of the fiscal year.

The Department of Astronautics received hundreds of letters re-
questing information concerning its specimens. Courses on the history
of astronautics and the national space program were taught by the
staff to youngsters of Smithsonian associates members. Frank H. Win-
ter was awarded the Robert Goddard Historical Essay award for his
paper on William Hale.

In the vicinity of Washington, D.C., there exist the largest holdings
of air and space documentation in the world. The primary responsi-
bility of the Information and Education Department is to support the
SCIENCE 45

curatorial staff with the documentation needed to select, authenticate,
and restore the artifacts needed to portray the evolutionary develop-
ment of air and space technology. To supplement the NAsm Histor-
ical Research Center’s extensive holdings, major documentation col-
lections in the field of air and space technology are available from
many other government and educational agencies.

The second major responsibility of the Information and Education
Department is serving the interested public, which encompasses the
model builder, author, technologist, and other museums. The follow-
ing figures show a comparison of this year’s activities with last year’s:

Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

To meet the new scientific concerns of the 1970s, research at the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory (sac) has been organized
into three major program areas—the Earth as a Planet, the Solar
System, and Energetic Phenomena in the Universe. These areas reflect
not only the overall goals of the Observatory’s investigations but also
the interrelationships of many once-separate fields that now are seen
as concerned with the “total environment of man.” Within these gen-
eral areas, however, some sixty investigators still pursue a broad range
of individual projects, thus ensuring that the Observatory will main-
tain the optimum balance between diversity and concentration.

Studies of the earth as a planet extend from the outer reaches of its
atmosphere and magnetosphere to its inner regions, with emphasis on
the structure, composition, and gravity field of the earth and on the
composition and physical processes of the atmosphere.

During the past year, the Observatory published one major inter-
national reference. The 1969 Smithsonian Standard Earth (II), and
contributed significantly to another, The International Reference
Atmosphere.
46 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

The first refines the representation of the earth’s size, shape, and
gravitational field issued by sao in 1966 and since widely used as a
model. The new Standard Earth shows that our planet has an intricate
pattern of “highs and lows” in the earth’s mean sea level relative to the
spheroid; these are more widespread than the recognizable topograph-
ical features usually associated with continental masses and ocean
beds. The existence of these anomalies has been revealed by computer
analysis of certain perturbations in the orbits of artificial satellites.
The refinement was made possible by data from the new laser tracking
systems at several sao stations and from deep-space probes, as well
as by photographic and other data.

Much of what is known about the earth’s atmosphere above 200
kilometers is based on Smithsonian analysis of satellite orbital data
gathered over the past decade. Observatory scientists have shown that
density variations in the atmosphere respond to a number of separate,
but related, geophysical and solar factors. For example, Observatory
scientists have found a correlation between satellite drag and solar
activity. The latter heats the earth’s upper atmosphere, thus increas-
ing its density and resistance to the satellite motion.

Observatory scientists also have discovered that diurnal heating of
the upper atmosphere, and its resultant change in atmospheric density,
lag about three hours behind the sun. Moreover, the heated bulge in
the atmosphere is shaped somewhat like an elongated eye, with the
broadest part at the equator and the tapered ends nearer the poles.
Most recently, they found that the solar wind—high-energy particles
ejected by the sun—also contributes to atmospheric heating.

SAO investigations of the solar system include theoretical, labora-
tory, and observational programs concerned with the moon and plan-
ets, the sun, meteors and comets, and meteorites and cosmic dust.

On 9 January 1970, near the hamlet of Lost City, Oklahoma, the
field manager of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory’s Prairie
Network recovered a 22-pound fragment of a meteorite that had been
photographed by the Network as the meteor fell to earth just six nights
earlier. Within the next four months, three more fragments were dis-
covered in the same area. This was only the second time in history—
and the first time, intentionally—that meteoritical material photo-
graphed entering the earth’s atmosphere had been recovered from the
ground.

The rapid recovery of the Lost City meteorite allowed immediate
analysis of its very short-lived radioisotopes created by cosmic-ray
bombardment. Moreover, the photographic record of the meteor fall
provides information on the meteorite’s origin (from the asteroid belt
beyond the orbit of Mars) and its loss of mass in flight. This informa-
SCIENCE 47

tion is particularly valuable because the meteorite proved to be a
bronzite chondrite, a type that probably accounts for some 35 percent
of all falls. Thus, Lost City can provide a standard reference for
meteoriticists around the world. Moreover, the photographic data can
be used to calibrate information gathered on thousands of bright
meteors photographed by both the Prairie Network and other organi-
zations.

Because of the Observatory’s experience in the analysis of recovered
meteoritical material, three separate research groups were selected as
principal investigators of lunar material returned by the Apollo
astronauts.

One research group has been engaged in the mineralogical and
petrological studies of lunar sample particles through X-ray diffrac-
tion and electron-microprobe techniques. These researchers have found
an unexpected amount of gabbroic anorthosite in Apollo 11 samples.
These anorthosite materials match the chemical composition of ma-
terials from the lunar highlands, thus suggesting that the anorthosites
may be mountain fragments tossed onto Mare Tranquillitatis (the
Apollo 11 landing site) by cratering impacts.

Another group has been conducting analyses of Apollo 11 and 12
samples to measure precisely the amounts of argon 37 and tritium,
radioactive isotopes created by cosmic-ray bombardment. This re-
search not only reveals information concerning radiation levels on the
moon but also provides indications of the exposure age of the samples
themselves. In a parallel effort, a third group is conducting isotopic
analyses of lunar samples with a laser to free the radioactive gases for
mass-spectrometer study.

Studies of energetic phenomena are concerned with the nature of
newly discovered and largely unexplained sources of radiation far
outside the solar system, as well as with the physical processes in
stellar objects that hold clues to the creation and evolution of the
universe.

Proceedings of the April 1969 meeting on stellar atmospheres held
jointly by sao and the Harvard College Observatory have now been
published as Theory and Observation of Normal Stellar Atmospheres
(mir Press: 1970). This standard reference work will provide a base-
line for much stellar-physics research for the next five years. Specifi-
cally, the book gives spectral and other data for a reference set of 68
stellar atmospheres in an effective temperature range from 4000°
to 50,000°. This grid of model atmospheres was computed entirely at
the Observatory.

A companion volume to the comprehensive SAO Star Catalog is-
sued in 1966 has now been published by mir Press. The Smithsonian
48 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

Star Atlas, a boxed collection of 152 individual sky charts, is a boon to
professional and amateur astronomers alike. The same quarter of a
million stars listed in the catalog are graphically depicted, with spe-
cial designations of double stars and variable stars, as well as nonstel-
lar objects such as galaxies, globular clusters, and planetary nebulas.

Observing the universe at radio wavelengths with an 85-foot an-
tenna, SAO astronomers are searching for signals from chemical com-
pounds not heretofore known to exist in space. Radiation of this type
is thought to come from the extended cloud of rarefied gases between
the stars. Concurrent laboratory studies are identifying other com-
pounds possibly present in space and measuring their characteristic
wavelengths, thus providing a basis for intensive searches with radio
telescopes.

A laboratory experiment performed jointly by personnel of the
National Bureau of Standards and of the Smithsonian Astrophysical
Observatory now indicates that laser emission by water vapor may be
involved in the process that converts the energy of infrared stars into
the microwave line radiation observed from water and hydroxyl mole-
cules in space. The experiment shows that a far-infrared spectral line
emitted by a water-vapor laser has nearly the same frequency as an
infrared absorption line of the hydroxyl molecule. By tuning the hy-
droxyl absorption line with a variable magnetic field, the experiment-
ers determined the exact frequency difference and deduced that an
optical pumping of the hydroxyl vapor could occur, at low pressures,
when the two lines were brought into coincidence. In space, this fine
tuning might be achieved by Doppler shifts.

Smithsonian scientists are now analyzing the data produced by the
Celescope experiment onboard Nasa’s second Orbiting Astronomical
Observatory. More than 8500 photographs of over 2800 areas of the
sky were made during the experiment’s lifetime. The photographs
provide brightness data for more than 25,000 stars in each of three
ultraviolet regions and for a limited number of stars in a fainter
region, as well as new information about the moon and comets and
about hydrogen near the earth.

The search for sources of ultra-high-energy gamma rays by the
Observatory is being conducted with a 34-foot optical reflector at
Mt. Hopkins and with balloon-borne detectors launched from Texas
and India. The observations at Mt. Hopkins represent the most sensi-
tive searches ever conducted. While no discrete sources have yet been
conclusively identified, the Mt. Hopkins project has established new
standards for determining “background noise,’ disproved several spu-
rious sources, helped revise several theories, and produced valuable new
information on the magnetic field of the Crab Nebula and that of the
SCIENCE 49

radio galaxy Virgo A. Ultimately, gamma-ray astronomy may pro-
vide the key to our understanding of many phenomena, including
magnetic fields, the density of matter, and high-energy particles in
intergalactic space and radio sources.

Astronomy seems poised ready to achieve a fuller understanding of
the universe in the 1970s. The mysteries of pulsars, quasars, gamma
rays, antimatter, and other possible keys to the evolution of the uni-
verse are now nearer than ever to being solved. Naturally, success
depends significantly on new instrumentation. Therefore, the Observa-
tory has embarked on a long-range program to develop the advanced
tools needed for the future. This year, for example, the Observatory
installed at Mt. Hopkins a new 60-inch reflecting telescope for studies
of stellar and planetary atmospheres. Also, production began on a
series of advanced laser-ranging systems for both geophysical and
lunar sciences.

Looking to the future, the Observatory continued its design studies
to determine the feasibility of constructing a very large, but inexpen-
sive and lightweight, optical telescope using many small primary
mirrors rather than a single large one. Also, development began on an
improved hydrogen-maser system, the most precise timing device
known, which could vastly improve the accuracy of many astronomical
measurements. Finally, the Observatory continued towork on ad-
vanced design concepts that might greatly reduce the cost of construct-
ing the world’s largest, fully steerable radio telescope.

This foresighted approach to the development of new instrumenta-
tion should allow the Observatory to meet the critical research
requirements of this next decade.

Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute

Competition for scarce resources and life space is an increasingly
urgent problem of human society. It has always been a problem for the
organisms of the tropics, where the greatest diversity of life-forms on
earth produces intense competition among species. Understanding the
outcome of this interaction—in effect, the reasons for evolutionary
success or failure—is one of the principal objectives of the Smithson-
ian Tropical Research Institute (sTrt).

In this connection, we are also seeking to determine how and why
tropical floras and faunas differ from those of the rest of the world.
50 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

Diversities are greater in the tropics, ecological and behavioral rela-
tions among species are more complex than elsewhere, and new and
major types of adaptation to new ways of life are more likely to be
evolved by tropical species than those of other regions. The scientists of
the sTri staff, research associates, fellows, visiting scientists, and ad-
vanced students from institutions all over the world, are attempting
to describe these features in more precise, quantitative, mathematical,
or physical terms, and to discover causal relationships among them.

Gaining such an understanding of the tropical environment is
imperative. Human populations in the tropics are increasing very
rapidly and are headed for ecological disaster in the absence of ade-
quate information about their environment. In the north, we are con-
cerned about air pollution, entrophication of lakes, and the deleterious
effects of insecticides. In the tropics, the problems are more brutal.
Areas such as the hill country of Colombia and Panama, and the
whole island of Madagascar are fast becoming deserts. The basic
features of tropical ecology must be understood as quickly as possible.
Assembling new insight and understanding into a coherent picture of
the tropics as a whole—where one half of mankind lives—is another
continuing objective of the Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute.
It offers a strong union of intellectual and environmental resources.
Advances were made in both realms in 1970.

During the year the community of workers in biology at sTRI grew
to include 9 staff biologists, 4 predoctoral and 6 postdoctoral fellows,
556 professional visitors (including 155 scientists and advanced stu-
dents working at srrt facilities for 4687 visitors days), from 62 uni-
versities in 31 states and 19 countries. Twenty-four seminars by staff
and visiting scientists were conducted at stri during this period.

The year saw continuation of an orderly progress of STRI re-
search into the tropical environs.

Exploration of marine areas was extended to the full length of the
Isthmus of Panama. With United States Navy cooperation, dives were
conducted in previously unexplored waters of the Pacific in western
Panama. Large constructional coral reefs, populations of the Crown-
of-Thorns starfish, nine species of fishes new to science and eleven new
to the fauna of Panama, in addition to two species of hydrocorals pre-
viously unreported in the eastern Pacific were the discovery highlights
of the initial expeditions. In the San Blas Islands, off the eastern
Panama Atlantic coast, a field team began exploration of complex reef
communities.

With a base camp at Barro Colorado Island, hydrobiologists
launched comparative studies on the dynamics of lakes, both natural
SCIENCE 5]

and man-made, in the lowlands and mountains of Panama, Colombia,
and Costa Rica.

On Barro Colorado Island itself, on a base of four decades of stud-
ies, an accelerating effort—including sixteen studies of one year or
longer—since 1965 is resulting in development of new methods for
discerning environmental adaptive strategies. Under study are biologi-
cal parameters such as reproductive strategies of forest trees, popula-
tion dynamics, and social organizations of possibly key organisms, com-
munication patterns and functions, and various questions of predatory
adaptations, energetics, and phenological characteristics. Thus, cor-
relative efforts may now proceed with greatly enhanced chances of
success.

Comparative studies elsewhere in the New World, and in the Old
World, are adding important new dimensions to the data on Panama
and are clarifying the distinctive biological role of the tropics. During
the year the staff and fellows of stri extended comparative studies
into the cold tropics of the Colombian Andes, into montane and low-
land continental regions of West Africa and India which vary inter-
estingly from Central America, and into the contrasting insular areas
of Madagascar and New Guinea.

Stri continued to concentrate on aspects of evolution, ecology, and
behavior, combining experimental analysis in the laboratory with ob-
servations in the field under natural conditions both in the Old and
New World tropics.

Adaptive strategies employed by organisms in their relationship to
their environment are particularly complex and varied in the tropics.
The adaptive aspects of plants, which have not been thoroughly stud-
ied in the past, are the concern of several studies: the nature of the
reproductive strategies employed by various tree species in the rich
Barro Colorado Forest; in-depth studies to delineate the complex
adaptations of orchids to their available insect resources; and com-
parative studies of the structure of tropical forests in both the New

and Old World.

The largest migration in 26 years of the day-flying moth Urania
fulgens was studied by Neal G. Smith. Billions of these conspicuous
moths crossed the isthmus toward South America between August
and October. Smith is trying to understand the adaptive significance
of this almost yearly migration which has been mentioned repeatedly
in newspaper and scientific literature as far back as the early 1800s.

Adaptive mechanisms of organisms in the marine environment
were brought under new study. Feeding experiments with visual fish
predators of the sand beach isopod Ancinus have shown a preference
52 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

for the most frequent pattern morph. This selective removal is con-
sidered important in affecting the polymorphic population structure.
The sea snake, Pelamis platurus, a docile, conspicuous, and highly
poisonous animal which at times is exceedingly abundant at the sur-
face along drift lines in the Pacific, was studied for its population
movements and basic biology by Chaim Kropach. Ira Rubinoff experi-
mented with potential fish predators of the snake in order to develop
a colonization model of theoretical as well as applied significance
should the animal gain introduction into the Atlantic. Pacific fishes
have adapted to avoid the snake, while Atlantic fishes of apparently
the same species eat them with avidity and are often bitten and die in
the process.

The partitioning of environmental resources among organisms is
being studied from a variety of perspectives, and on a variety of
species, with suprisingly different results in some cases. The relation-
ships between food niche overlap and food availability in stream
dwelling fishes was studied by Tom Zaret and A. Stanley Rand. They
found evidence that the degree of overlap correlated well with prey
abundance. On the other hand Henry Hespenheide has shown that
over a broad range of species and feeding habits of birds, the width
of niches as measured by prey size is a function only of the mean prey
size, and thus is independent of such factors as prey abundance and
foraging techniques of the birds. Related data gathered by Eugene
Morton indicates that while adult vireos eat insects in the rainy sea-
son, they eat fruit in the dry season when they breed, but feed their
young insects. This may be adaptation to reduce intraspecific com-
petition when insects are relatively scarce.

Amazingly, it has taken fifty-four years after its creation for Gatun
Lake to become a subject of intensive biological study. Z.M. Gliwicz
of the University of Warsaw, Department of Hydrobiology, undertook
a fifteen-month investigation of the primary and secondary productiy-
ity of Gatun and Madden lakes, and extended this comparative
analysis to lakes in Costa Rica and Colombia. A key purpose is to com-
pare the ecological efficiency of the primary production utilization by
plankton consumers in temperate and tropical lakes similar in mor-
phometry and trophic characteristics.

Intraspecific behavior is affected importantly by relations between
species, and their adaptations, as reflected in their “communication
systems.” The ways in which “messages,” whether simply or highly
specialized signals, mediate among organisms, and with the environ-
ment, is one of the principal pursuits of research at sTri. A. Stanley
Rand continued his studies of animal communication in amphibians

and reptiles. In collaboration with George Drewry of the Puerto Rican
Nuclear Center, he analyzed the chorus structure in Puerto Rican
frogs. They found that species that chorus together vocalize at dif-
ferent frequencies, apparently to avoid interspecific jamming. Their
vocalizations also differ in a number of other ways, presumably encod-
ing other information.

Coral reefs in the eastern Pacific have been considered typically
represented by those in the relatively well-studied area of Panama
Bay. Srrr conducted two highly productive expeditions to the Secas
and Contreras islands which have made it clear that the interpretation
of biotic composition and species numbers between Atlantic and
Pacific coasts have been biased. Coral reefs and associated fauna of
considerable richness were found. Revealed for the first time along the
Pacific Ocean in Central America were the occurrence of large con-
structional coral reefs; populations of the Crown-of-Thorns starfish
(Acanthaster), an important predator and an associated shrimp
(Hymenocera) ; a coelenterate hydrocoral group represented by at least
two species of the stinging form Millepora; and several fish species
previously known only from the western Pacific biogeographic region.

In its educational emphasis sTRI serves as an advanced studies
center. Informal guidance and association mark the sTri professional
contribution to independent studies by visiting scientists, research
fellows, and advanced students. More than seventy projects by visitors
were accommodated in 1970.

Seminar programs were offered and attended by staff and students
from other research and educational institutions on the Isthmus of
Panama.

Stri scientists also extended their educational contributions else-
where. During the year they conducted seminars at the University of
Panama, University of California, University of Chicago, Cornell
University, Harvard University, Rockefeller University, Washington
University, and elsewhere. Courses were conducted at the University
of Mexico by Dr. Dressler, at the University of Pennsylvania by Drs.
Rand and Robinson, and at Princeton University by Dr. Leigh.

The Organization of Tropical Studies conducted a major portion of
its marine sciences summer course at STRI.

The Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute is indebted for the
continuing excellent cooperation extended by the government and
agencies of the Republic of Panama, by the Panama Canal Company
and Canal Zone government, by the United States Southern Command,
and by our fellow research and educational institutions throughout the
Isthmus of Panama, and in Colombia.

Radiation Biology Laboratory

From a number of small buildings in the old Astrophysical Observa-
tory Yard south of the Smithsonian Building and a few small rooms
scattered throughout the Smithsonian Building, the Radiation Biology
Laboratory has been relocated to new modern quarters in Rockville,
Maryland. The new facility is a two-story structure designed to meet
specialized requirements of the areas of biological and environmental
research relating to the program of the laboratory. The areas of inves-
tigation are principally in the field of regulatory biology and include:
(1) physiology, (2) biochemical processes of developmental responses
to light, and (3) measurement of solar radiation. In addition, the lab-
oratory maintains a carbon-dating facility for archeological and
anthropological research and for research and development in carbon-
dating techniques.

The new building provides about fifty thousand square feet of space
and includes plant physiology, biochemistry, biophysics, genetics, and
biology laboratories. There is a staff office, a general laboratory work
area, small handling and preparation rooms, and special function
rooms, such as controlled temperature units, drak-growth rooms, and
light-treatment facilities. A Phillips, Model 300, electron microscope
has been installed. Low-level counting systems for radiocarbon dating
and a standards laboratory for photometric and radiometric calibrat-
ing standards are being installed. Several large areas are planned for
environmental control rooms, a temperature-controlled greenhouse,
and specialized irradiation systems, such as monochromators for action
spectra determinations. Installation of equipment is in progress.

The support facilities for the laboratory include a small auditorium,
a library, secretarial and administrative offices, and an instrument
shop for servicing the laboratory research programs.

The monitoring and recording of radiation measurements was con-
tinued at the Mall location throughout the year. An additional facility
at Rockville was installed and is functioning. The personnel comple-
ment at the station in Jerusalem, Israel, was completed, and data are
being accumulated on a continuous basis. A new radiometric instru-
ment has been developed through joint efforts of the Smithsonian
Radiation Biology Laboratory and Eppley Laboratories for extending
the monitoring of spectral quality of daylight to include pre-sunrise
and post-sunset periods when biological clocks are presumed to be
activated. This area of solar radiation measurement is a new phase of
investigation in physical measurements for biological purposes.
BG SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

In the research area of the electron microscopy study of the fine struc-
ture of algae, recent evidence obtained revealed that there are major
structural differences in the location of the phycobiliproteins (photo-
synthetic accessory pigments). In red and blue-green algae they are
aggregated on the stroma side of the photosynthetic lamellae, while in
the photosynthetic cryptophyte algae, the phycobilins are located in
the intrathylakoidal spaces. The known chemical and structural dif-
ferences lead to the conclusion that these pigments appeared indepen-
dently in evolutionary development.

There have been several recent additions to the staff. Dr. Roy Hard-
ing, geneticist, will assume the direction of work on chromosome
aberrations induced by ultraviolet radiation and will also undertake
work on the genetics of photoperiodism. Dr. Andrew Snope will assist
with this work. Dr. Maurice Margulies has spent the past year on
sabbatical leave at Harvard University.

Despite curtailment of research necessitated by the relocation, a
number of research papers were completed and published by members
of the staff. Staff members participated in scientific meetings and
conferences, both national and international.

National Zoological Park

The National Zoological Park celebrates this year the 80th anniver-
sary of its founding in 1890. From a small menagerie housed in the
rolling woodland of Rock Creek Park, it has grown into one of the
important zoos of the world.

One important action taken this year resulted in the Zoo being
transferred from the budget of the District of Columbia to the appro-
priation of the Smithsonian Institution. This will lead to a change of
emphasis regarding education, conservation, and advancement of
science and should lead to the development of a truly National Zoo, so

that it will no longer be mistakenly referred to as “the Washington
Zoo.”

The new hospital-and research building was completed in December
1969 and is partially occupied. The Scientific Research Department
has already moved into its offices and laboratories. The Animal Health
Department and the Office of the Pathologist will transfer to the new
building shortly. The spacious, thoroughly modern facility is located
near the Director’s office on Administration Hill.

Fieldwork in connection with the Ceylon elephant project, begun in
1967, has been completed. This was headed by resident scientist, John
F. Eisenberg and was undertaken as a Smithsonian project in coopera-
tion with the Ceylon government. The primate study in that country
is continuing.

The status of the collection remains about the same. The aim of the
National Zoological Park is to obtain collections of diversified animal
groups, rather than solitary individuals, so that reproduction, espe-
cially of rare species, may be encouraged.!

1 Certain tabulated, statistical, and other information formerly contained in
the report of the National Zoological Park in the Smithsonian Year now appears
as appendixes to the Separate of this Report (available on request from the
Director of the National Zoological Park). This information contains: visitor
statistics and other operational information; report of the Veterinarian, aug-
mented by case histories and autopsy reports; report of the pathologist; and
complete lists of (a) animals in the collection on 30 June 1970; (b) all births

and hatchings during the year; (c) changes in the collection by gift, purchase,
or exchange.
58 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

Many exciting and valuable gifts were received during the year.
Through the good offices of Crawford H. Greenewalt, a Regent of the
Smithsonian, a notable collection of New Guinea fauna was acquired.
This consisted of four birds of paradise of two different species, a king
parrot, an orange lory, three tree kangaroos, and six sugar gliders.

The government of Indonesia presented the National Zoo with a
Komodo dragon as a mate for the lone female that the Zoo has had
since 1967. When President Suharto and his wife paid a state visit to
Washington, Mrs. Suharto came to the Zoo, bringing with her a
photograph of the huge male, which arrived a few days later on 27
May.

Another gift from a foreign government was a pair of tuataras. The
rare reptile is considered a bridge between the living reptiles of today
and those of prehistoric times. These were formally presented by
Ambassador Frank Corner of New Zealand at a ceremony in the
reptile house on 4 June. Tuataras are often referred to as “living
fossils” because they are the sole survivors of the age of reptiles and
have scarcely changed since the Triassic Period of 200 million years

ago. They are being carefully protected in simulated native habitat.
There are only two others in United States zoos.

The number of births continues to be gratifying. There was one
tragedy, however; Mohini, the white tigress, gave birth to four cubs,
two white and two normal color, on 8 March. Forty-eight hours later
she gave birth to another cub, stillborn, and in the course of labor she
fell on three of the first born, killing them. Moni, the lone survivor, a
white male, was removed from her den and successfully reared in the
Director’s home. He is now on exhibition at the Zoo.

An orangutan and a black rhinoceros were born during the year, and
antelopes acquired over the past few years, since the establishment of
the new hoofed-stock area, are now reproducing satisfactorily. The
number of hatchings at the bird house surpassed any former year and
included some that had not previously occurred here.

Although hiring of personnel has been restricted, the Zoo was for-
tunate in getting an architect on the staff, Mr. Norman Melun, who
reported for work on 4 May. This enables the Zoo to set up a planning
division, which will oversee the development and modernization of

the Park.

After many months of investigation and discussion, the Friends of
the National Zoo were finally able to inaugurate the running of three
trackless trains. There are three train stations and visitors may board
at any one of them, ride to the next stop, view the animals and continue
either on the same train or on the next one that comes along. These
rides are proving very popular, and proceeds from the sale of tickets
will go to the Friends’ educational fund.

Office of Environmental Sciences

On 28 October 1970 the Secretary established the office of Environ-
mental Sciences in order to “make more visible the Smithsonian Insti-
tution’s broad spectrum of research projects in the environmental
sciences and improve the opportunities for attracting financial support
and scientific collaboration.” Building on the accomplishments of the
Ecology Program and the Oceanography and Limnology Program, the
Office has continued a series of activities to bring the Smithsonian to
the attention of national and international scientific groups including
funding agencies.
60 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

Recognizing that the care and study of the research collections are a
principal function of the largest Smithsonian bureau, the National
Museum of Natural History (NMNH), the office places its greatest
emphasis in collaboration with this program. Support is sought for
and provided to scientists in NMNH_ in several ways. Collecting
expeditions are supported by incorporating plans of Smithsonian sci-
entists into international programs, such as the U.S. Antarctic Pro-
gram and the Southeast Asia Ministers of Education BIoTROP
project developed in Indonesia. The International Union for Conser-
vation of Nature and Natural Resources developed field conferences
and symposia with Smithsonian participation and the Cooperative
Investigations of the Mediterranean will include Smithsonian collect-
ing. Other cooperative bilateral collecting was arranged by the Office
in Taiwan, Iran, Australia, Ceylon, Israel, Tunisia, Thailand, Laos,
Cambodia, New Zealand, Chile, Brazil, British Honduras, United
States and French Pacific Trust Territories, Japan, Korea, India,
Pakistan, Kenya, Ethiopia, Indonesia, Malta, France, Italy, Jamaica,
Panama, Argentina, Ecuador, and other countries.

The results of marine collecting are received and sorted by two
processing centers, the Smithsonian Oceanographic Sorting Center
and the Mediterranean Marine Sorting Center. The masses of material
collected by nets, trawls, and dredges are such that there is a sub-
stantial backlog of work to be accomplished. In increasing the avail-
ability of sorting, distribution, and identification services the Office
has proposed and is negotiating the establishment of sorting centers in
South America (Chile) and in Asia (Indonesia or the Philippines.)
These centers recognize the requirement for utilization of the research
and identification of hundreds of scientists in work on marine collec-
tions and arrange the participation of competent marine scientists
wherever they exist in the world. In addition to using all available
NMNH scientists it has been possible to enroll about three hundred
non-Smithsonian scientists in twenty-seven countries of the world, who
work to gain information from the collections made available by the
sorting centers.

Even with the above collections-related scientific effort, there are
biological taxa which need attention because of special interest from
an agency standpoint. Using money for Antarctic studies, the Office
provides funds for specialists to carry on the necessary identifications
and related research in certain taxa, which are potentially important
as Antarctic resources. In a similar manner the Office stimulates the
production of keys to freshwater organisms of importance to the Fed-
eral Water Quality Administration.
SCIENCE 61

Within available resources the Office supports inadequately funded
Smithsonian scientists by assisting with the purchase of collections,
assisting with publication costs, and meeting otherwise unfunded re-
quirements such as visiting other museums. Assistance is provided in
recruitment of personnel to fill gaps in Smithsonian scientific capabili-
ties. Consultants are provided to advise on scientific problems and in
special cases a person may be employed temporarily to fill an NMNH
need, pending the establishment of a NMNH position.

The possible role of the Smithsonian in national and international
plans is considered within and outside the federal government. Inter-
ests of the Smithsonian are written into projects having appropriate
objectives. Liaison is maintained for this purpose with the National
Council for Marine Resources and Engineering Development, the
Federal Council for Science and Technology, the Council on Environ-
mental Quality, the National Water Commission, and broad projects
of the Departments of State, Defense, Interior, Health, Education and
Welfare, the National Science Foundation, and Atomic Energy Com-
mission. Close association is also maintained with programs of the
National Academy of Sciences.

In attracting financial support the Office develops concepts appro-
priate to funding by public and private agencies and individuals in as
varied a nature as possible within the time available. Funding of such
ideas was received from the National Science Foundation, Atomic
Energy Commission, Coast Guard, Coast and Geodetic Survey, Naval
Oceanographic Office, Office of Naval Research, Army Engineers,
Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, National Institutes of Health, De-
partment of State, Federal Water Quality Administration, Agency for
International Development, National Academy of Sciences, American
Association for the Advancement of Sciences, Woods Hole Oceano-
graphic Institution, American Institute of Biological Sciences, Link
Foundation, Vetlesen Foundation, Iran Foundation, Atlantic Founda-
tion, TaiPing Foundation, Asia Foundation, Smithsonian Research
Foundation, Smithsonian Foreign Currency Program, Edwin A. Link,
J. Seward Johnson, Carl Dry, Alpine Geophysics, Incorporated, and
Ocean Systems, Incorporated.

Current program development lies in such broad program areas as
(1) environmental assessment and prediction as a result of man’s
activities, (2) provision and protection of natural areas, (3) expedit-
ing collections and related research, (4) developing Smithsonian par-
ticipation in national and international environmental programs, (5)
providing ship and underwater support of research, and (6) operating
the Chesapeake Bay Center for Environmental Studies in such a way
62 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

as to insure its productivity and viability as a model watershed, a
natural preserve, and a local asset.

Center for the Study of Man

In its second year of operation the Center for the Study of Man has
continued to carry out a number of cooperative research and informa-
tion programs in the human sciences. The most important single
development of the year occurred at the second annual meeting of the
full membership held at the Smithsonian during 16-19 May 1970. The
members agreed that the Center should become in effect an interna-
tional studies center devoted to adding anthropological perspective to
understanding of such major world problems as war, colonialism, de-
structive nationalism, gross inequalities, racism, poverty, technological
and urban overdevelopment, irreversible environmental destruction,
population growth, alienation, anomie, and lack of generational con-
tinuity. The Center will establish annually a new international “task
force” of research anthropologists and other scientists to deal for a
limited time (perhaps five years) with a selected and closely defined
facet of one of these major problems. The first problem to be inves-
tigated is human fertility. A working paper has been commissioned
and the work of assembling resources is underway.

The American Indian program of the Center was very active
throughout the past year. A major objective of this program is to
assist Indians in achieving goals which they have set for themselves.
This has been done in a modest way by sending them difficult-to-
obtain materials free of charge, by referring them to anthropologists
and other scholars who can help them in matters involving their
rights, by referring them to other Indian groups with similar prob-

lems, and by advising them in matters where they have requested our
knowledge.

The program to computerize a roster of 4700 anthropologists
throughout the world has been completed. The results of this pro-
gram, carried out in conjunction with the Smithsonian Information
Systems Division and with the support of the Wenner-Gren Founda-
tion for Anthropological Research will appear in a forthcoming issue
of the world-wide anthropological journal Current Anthropology.

The Center has continued to coordinate the Urgent Anthropology
Program. Six grants involving four different countries have been
SCIENCE 63

made under the Small Grants Program for urgent research. Some
results of this program are now beginning to be received and one such
is the discovery of a new Java Man skull by Professor Sartono of the
Bandung Institute in Indonesia.

The current bibliography of anthropological publications has con-
tinued to develop under the direction of Dr. Robert M. Laughlin. In
the past year a total of 6800 titles has been classified and readied for
publication. To date 2439 have been published and the remainder
will continue to appear bimonthly.

A special committee on the proposed National Museum of Man,
chaired by Dr. Irven DeVore, met in February 1970 to develop plans
for relating the Center to the proposed Museum. The report of this
meeting, presented to Secretary Ripley at the Center’s meeting in May,
precipitated the subsequent resolution on the part of the membership
to move the Center in its new direction.

Center for Short-Lived Phenomena

The Center for Short-Lived Phenomena now has more than 2500
registered correspondents located in 124 countries of the world includ-
ing 956 earth science correspondents, 379 biological science correspon-
dents, 266 astrophysical science correspondents, 189 urgent anthro-
pology/urgent archaeology correspondents, 191 Transient Lunar
Phenomena correspondents, and 372 multidisciplinary correspondents.

During 1969 the Center reported to scientists around the world
145 short-lived events that occurred in 58 countries including 61 earth
science events, 52 biological science events, 24 astrophysical science
events, and 4 urgent archeological and 2 urgent anthropological events.
Scientific teams investigated at least 102 of the 145 events reported
by the Center in 1969.

The Center reported 18 volcanic eruptions in Alaska, Antarctica,
Costa Rica, Hawaii, Indonesia, Japan, the Mariana Islands, New
Zealand, Nicaragua, Peru, the Philippines, and the Soviet Union.

The Center reported 18 other earth science events during the year,
including major landslides in Sweden, Hungary, Finland, Israel, and
the Azores, two submarine volcanic eruptions in the Marianas and the
Solomon Islands, a major tidal wave in China, a natural gas eruption
in Yugoslavia, a major flood in China, a major mud flow in Hungary,
a rockfall in the French Alps, a storm surge in the Hawaiian Islands,
64 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

and a floating island in the Caribbean. At least 42 of the 61 earth
science events were investigated by one or more field research teams.

The Center reported 52 biological events, including 12 oil spills in
the Netherlands, England, France, South Africa, Alaska, and the
continental United States; 19 animal kills in Ireland, Spain, Peru,
Canada, England, South Africa, and the United States; 11 animal
irruptions, migrations, and colonizations occurring in Australia, Pan-
ama, Trinidad, Peru, Alaska and the United States; six pollution
events occurring in the Philippine Islands, Peru, Germany and the
United States; and two major flora kills occurring in Japan and the
United States.

At least 46 of the 52 biological events reported by the Center in
1969 were investigated by one or more field research teams.

The Center reported 24 astrophysical events including 17 major
fireball events in Japan, Greece, Mexico, Malawi, Brazil, Tunisia,
Canada, Australia, New Zealand, and the United States; 4 meteorite
falls in Mexico, Czechoslovakia, Australia, and Ireland; and several
transient lunar events that occurred during Apollo manned lunar
missions.

Specimens of all four meteorites were quickly recovered and sent to
laboratories for radioisotope analysis. Delay between the time of the
fall of the objects and the time they arrived in measuring laboratories
ranged from four days for “Allende” to eighteen days for “Murchison”
with the average being eleven days. In addition, fireball ablation pro-
ducts were successfully sampled in the atmosphere by high altitude air
collection aircraft within 12-18 hours after the “Allende” event
occurred.

During 1969 the Center reported two urgent anthropological events
(the discovery of two new tribes in Surinam and Colombia) and four
urgent archeological events.

The Center issued 143 event notification reports, 523 event informa-
tion reports, 12 event publications, and handled a communications
volume of 245,000 cable words and a mail volume of 390,000 pieces
during 1969.

5] ies FISCAL YEAR 1970 was one of real accomplishments and of

real promise in the areas of history and art at the Smithsonian.
As the National Collection of Fine Arts and the National Portrait
Gallery settled more comfortably into their quarters in the historic
Patent Office Building, construction on the Joseph H. Hirshhorn Mu-
seum and Sculpture Garden began, the refurbishing of the Renwick
Gallery continued, and the Cooper-Hewitt Museum prepared to
move into the Andrew Carnegie Mansion of New York’s Fifth Avenue.

In every case, our history and art bureaus, often with the valuable
assistance of their advisory boards and commissions, emerged from a
serious consideration of their purposes and plans with a strengthened
sense of mission and identity. Although increased appropriations were
not the order of the day this year, we are sure that this sharpened
sense of purpose, this exercise in self-definition, will allow each of our
bureaus to make the best possible use of the funds that are available to
it.

This was also a year in which the Smithsonian welcomed a number
of extraordinary new directors, whose several qualifications range
from brilliant service in other museums, or in other parts of the Smith-
sonian, to academic distinction of the highest sort. Since it is our
museum and bureau directors who must formulate and carry out the
Institution’s programs in history and art, this infusion of new talent
and enthusiasm augurs well for the future.

In addition to the exhibitions and acquisitions mentioned below, a
special word should be said about the coming to the Smithsonian of
the Archives of American Art. This enormously important archival
resource will strengthen the position of the Smithsonian as a leading
national center for the study of American civilization; the presence of
the Archives has already made itself felt in our successful efforts to
recruit distinguished scholars to the staffs of our various museums.

In addition to the obvious and satisfying progress of each of our
history and art bureaus, it is pleasant to report that relations among
them seem more cordial than ever. The transfer of portraits from
the National Collection of Fine Arts to the National Portrait Gallery,
as urged by the Portrait Gallery Commission, as well as the transfer of
three Augustus Saint-Gaudens reliefs to the National Collection of
Fine Arts from the National Portrait Gallery was a case in point. The
Cooper-Hewitt Museum’s gracious loan of a number of Winslow
Homer paintings to the National Collection of Fine Arts, where they

67
68 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

are now beautifully displayed, is another. As the Institution enters a
period of intensive preparation for the celebration of the Bicentennial
of the American Revolution, we are confident that the strengths of our
individual bureaus, and their willingness to work together in a com-
mon cause, will prove worthy to this great occasion.

National Museum of History and Technology

The announcement made in January 1969 of the appointment of
Dr. Daniel J. Boorstin as the Director of the National Museum of
History and Technology signalized the search for a fresh approach to
history in the museum world. Coming from the Department of His-
tory of the University of Chicago, Dr. Boorstin assumed his new
responsibilities in October.

He immediately directed his efforts, with the cooperation of his
scholarly staff, to the development of new programs designed to
widen, deepen, and enlarge the visitors’ museum involvement by re-
capturing man’s experience in everyday life in the nation’s past. By
employing innovative techniques in exhibition and by reinterpretation
of the unwritten documents of American civilization which form the
national collections, new emphasis is being directed to several hitherto
neglected aspects of the Museum’s functions and capabilities.

A sweeping new program of visitor orientation was instituted to
make the Museum’s holdings and facilities more readily accessible and
meaningful to the more than five million visitors who come to it each
year. Several successful elements of this program, designed to provide
useful guidance to the public at various levels, have already been initi-
ated. A series of special tour brochures to provide self-guidance to the
visitor was produced to highlight particular aspects of history pre-
sented in the Museum and specialized subject interests. A continuing
series of changing special exhibits at the Mall entrance commemorate
historical events of national importance and traditional American
holidays. Through a display of selected materials (including national
treasures from the collections and incorporating modern audio-visual
techniques), the holiday exhibits orient the public to the other dis-
plays within the Museum on related subjects. More elaborate orienta-
tion techniques and programs to assist the public more effectively in
the use of the Museum are being developed.
HISTORY AND ART 69

The emerging new role of the Museum as the national center for
the study of American civilization was recognized in the annual ban-
quet of the Society of American Historians, for which the Museum
served as host, and at which presentations of the Francis Parkman Prize
and the Allan Nevins Prize were made.

Considerable effort has been directed in the past year to develop
plans for the Museum’s role in the forthcoming celebration of the
American Revolution Bicentennial. Planning for a comprehensive
program combining exhibits, conferences, and publications is in
progress.

The continuing exhibits program of the Museum has been redi-
rected to feature selected materials from major collections which have

70 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

not yet been exhibited, and material aspects of American life which
have not been acknowledged elsewhere in the exhibition areas. Dis-
played for the first time in the Museum is a new exhibit incorporating
significant historical machinery and products of the American textile
industry. In a representative sampling of American textiles organized
by the curator, Rita Adrosko, the historic carding machine of Samuel
Slater and components of Slater’s spinning machine are highlighted.
These machines, which were made about 1790, brought textile produc-
tion out of the home into a developing American textile industry.
Featured also is the only Jacquard loom in operable condition in any
American museum. The exhibit includes programmed spinning and
weaving demonstrations by members of the staff.

“Energy Conversion,” a special exhibit prepared by Warren Danzen-
baker under the direction of Bernard S. Finn, was opened in September
and illustrated the methods of converting energy sources to electrical

power. Historic specimens in the national collections were displayed
together with significant artifacts donated by related industries. Among
these were the world’s first fuel-cell tractor and an Apollo spacecraft
fuel cell, as well as a thermoelectric generator and numerous other
artifacts, which demonstrated the story of man’s harnessing of heat,
sunlight, and chemical energy.

Renewed efforts have been made by the Museum’s scholarly staff
as part of a long-range program to render the displayed collections
more meaningful to the public, by attempting to recapture the
environment of the past in which the materials exhibited play a role.

A conference and exhibit on “The Roots of California Culture,”
conceived and developed by C. Malcolm Watkins, were held at the
Oakland Museum in April, and sponsored jointly by the Museum’s
Department of Cultural History, the University of California Exten-
sion, and the Oakland Museum. Six curators presented papers focused
on the background environments of the major groups that settled
California, cumulative material cultures that conditioned them, and
the industrial technology that emerged in the nineteenth century to
effect the cultural changes that made California a “nation within a
nation.” A special exhibition related to the original man-made en-
vironment and material culture that emerged after the settlement of
the West was prepared in the National Museum of History and
Technology, which drew from its reserve collections of objects of

everyday life in pre-industrial and Victorian America and were com-
bined with materials from the Oakland Museum. The exhibition will
tour other museums and institutions in California on continuing
display.

Special exhibits, produced during the year, have ranged from
“Women in Politics,’ which was conceived by Keith E. Melder and
opened in May to commemorate the founding of the League of
Women Voters, to a temporary hall planned by Philip W. Bishop,
featuring artifacts and models in a historical approach to remind the
visitor of the size and importance of the American iron and steel
industry.

The maintenance and development of the national collection con-
tinued to be a major concern of the curatorial staff, with a total of
104,731 additions made to the Museum’s holdings in the past year.
Although the major part of the Museum’s acquisitions are accepted
for display, there is nevertheless equal curatorial concern for develop-
ing the Museum’s resources for study by the curatorial staff and visit-
ing scholars and students. Among such significant new study accessions
was a collection of approximately thirteen thousand glass and film
negatives recording the production of the Pullman Car Works for a
period of almost half a century from 1885 to 1932. This plant is of
particular significance to railroad history because it built not only the
elegant sleeping and parlor cars for the Pullman Company, but it also
produced thousands of freight cars.

The Museum benefited by a generous gift of almost the entire col-
lection of old type matrices owned by the American Type Founders, a
unique collection consisting of thousands of sets of nineteenth-century
matrices made by independent foundries. Arrangements have been
completed by the curator, Elizabeth M. Harris, to have fonts of type
from the more significant mats cast by private subscribers on the con-
dition that a font of each be deposited in the collection. A checklist of
the mats is in preparation and an illustrated catalog with the histories,
specifications, illustrations, and identifications will be one of the valu-
able products of this project. This is merely one example of the many
ways in which the Museum not only serves the public in its avowed
functions as the keeper of the national collections with its exhibits and
publications, but also preserves more pedestrian aspects of the Ameri-
can heritage.

Continuing his program of studies in industrial archeology, Robert
M. Vogel documented by interview, by physical measurement, and with
motion picture film, the process of manufacturing wooden wheels—
a process virtually unchanged in the Hoopes Bro. & Darlington
factory in Westchester, Pennsylvania, since the end of the nineteenth
HISTORY AND ART 73

century. Similarly in the field of medical science, Audrey Davis under-
took a study of the development of the gastroscope, with interviews of
individuals connected with its early history and filming of the manu-
facture of the instrument at the original United States plant, which
was established in the 1940s.

In the Division of Postal History, Carl H. Scheele and Reidar Norby
developed a series of exhibits of postal issues of groups of countries,
which in addition to providing continuing displays resulted in the
acquisition of important stamps and postal objects, and added depth
and broadness to the study collections which are utilized by numerous
visiting researchers.

A deliberate program has been initiated for the acquisition of new
collections of historical materials not already represented in the na-
tional collections. This program will enlist the cooperation of the
related industries. Plans are proceeding for development of collections
and exhibits of the history of American advertising art, the history of
early broadcasting and radio, and similar aspects of American life
which previously have not been the subject matter of museums.

Archives of American Art

On 1 May 1970 the Archives of American Art formally joined the
Smithsonian Instution as a bureau.

The Archives, which was founded in Detroit in 1954 as an in-°
dependent research institution, is committed to encouraging and aid-
ing scholarship in the visual arts in this country from the 18th century
to the present time. It acts to achieve this goal by acquiring and pre-
serving the primary documentation needed by historians—the cor-
respondence, diaries, business papers, and photographs, of painters,
sculptors, critics, dealers, and collectors, and the formal records of
galleries, museums, and art organizations. These collections of papers
are microfilmed and made available to scholars in a series of regional
branch offices and through interlibrary loans.

The processing and chief reference center of the Archives is now
located in space provided by the National Collection of Fine Arts/
National Portrait Gallery Library. Regional branch offices operate in
New York and Detroit and field offices were established in 1970 in
Boston and Santa Fe.
74, SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

During the past year the Archives has acquired over 100,000 items.
Among the more important collections received were the papers of
William Baziotes, Cecilia Beaux, Karl Bitter, Herbert Ferber, Palmer
Hayden, Ibram Lassaw, Guy Pene du Bois, José de Rivera, and Ben
Shahn. Of particular interest is a large collection of records accumu-
lated by Charles Henry Hart, an authority on 18th and early 19th cen-
tury portraiture.

The Archives’ oral history program continued its activities with a
series of tape-recorded interviews with administrators and other fig-
ures in the New York art world. This work was made possible by a
grant from the New York State Council on the Arts. Among those
people interviewed were Harvard Arnason, Ralph Colin, Lawrence
Fleischman, Henry Geldzahler, Huntington Hartford, and Gordon
Washburn.

Freer Gallery of Art

Mr. Freer understood that the most effective way to study a civili-
zation, to learn what motivated the thinking of men in other times
and other parts of the world, was to study the finest things they made.
The investigation of the reasons why men made these beautiful things,
and the research into the nature of the materials of which they were
made, and the methods used to fashion those materials cannot but
yield basic information about the men themselves and the civilizations
they created. Thus the twofold program envisaged by Mr. Freer in-
volves the continuing search for works of oriental art of the highest
quality that may be added to the Freer Gallery collections and the con-
tinuing study of these works of art as keys to understanding the civili-
zations that produced them. This research in all its manifold aspects is
the basic task of the professional staff of the Freer Gallery; and all the
supporting services of the Gallery (library, photographic laboratory,
oriental picture-mounting studio, technical laboratory, etc.) operate
to expedite and facilitate this research. Members of the curatorial staff
travel frequently and widely in order to be familiar with the latest
additions to other collections, to examine archeological sites and find-
ings, and to meet and discuss problems of mutual interest with col-
leagues who are engaged in related research. At the same time, we re-
ceive and give every cooperation to all scholars, including many from
Europe and Asia, who come to the Freer Gallery to make use of our
unparalleled resources both in the collections themselves and in the
study facilities. We also give guidance and encouragement to gradu-
ate students in the field who come to the Gallery either for short
visits or for protracted periods under established fellowship programs.

Work of this kind does not lend itself to sensational discoveries. It
proceeds slowly, and when something important is accomplished, it is
published. Our public is to be found among the users of 500-odd li-
braries and universities all over the world that receive Freer publica-
tions free of charge. The books are also widely sold. Our most recent
work, published this year, was the second volume of The Freer
Chinese Bronzes, which deals with the technical aspects of the subject.
This was a pioneering effort in that it is the first book ever devoted to
the study of the materials and methods which produced the magnifi-
cent vessels that are the glory of the Bronze Age in China and one of
the finest artistic achievements in the history of mankind.
76 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

To maintain the atmosphere that fosters productive research, to con-
tinue adding to the sum of knowledge of the civilizations of the East,
to publish and make available this information to the interested
world, these matters are the concen of those who are responsible for
the operation of the Freer Gallery.

National Collection of Fine Arts

The year was marked by a series of major exhibitions organized and
shown by the National Collection of Fine Arts and the first steps to-
ward the reorganization of the permanent collection and establishment
of new activities in the areas of education and research. The most
notable of the temporary exhibitions, all with catalogs, were the large
retrospective of the work of Milton Avery; the very popular exhibition

’

“Explorations,” organized by the International Art Program and pro-
duced by the Center for Advanced Visual Studies under Gyorgy Kepes
at Massachusetts Institute of Technology; and a mid-career retrospec-
tive of the work of Leonard Baskin. In connection with “Explora-
tions,’ several special events were scheduled—musical performances,
a poetry reading, and an expanded program of experimental films. A
handsomely installed exhibition of Tibetan Art prepared by Asia
House was shown, although the policy will now be to exhibit only

American art and related material in the Fine Arts Gallery.

Various areas of the building were redesigned and systematic stor-
age areas reinstalled. A larger portion of the permanent collection was
placed on exhibition and an easily accessible print and drawing study
room was instituted. ‘wo small exhibitions, one devoted to Winslow
Homer (chiefly of works from the Cooper-Hewitt Museum) and one
made up of painting and sculpture from the 1930s, inaugurated a new
policy of informal exhibitions underscoring various aspects of the per-
manent collection.

Activity with local school children continued at the Children’s Mu-
seum and an active docents program was climaxed by a lively chil-
dren’s spring festival.

Plans have continued for the further restoration of the Renwick
Gallery, scheduled to open in 1971, which will be devoted to Ameri-
can design and crafts.

The International Art Program circulated a print workshop and
various exhibitions abroad, among the most interesting being “Disap-

National Portrait Gallery

The year past was the first for the second Director at the National
Portrait Gallery. While much of the time during this period was spent
in the preparation of programs and the planning of events that will
not materialize until 1971, one major exhibition occurred this year and
110 portraits were added to the permanent collection.

The exhibition was “Augustus Saint-Gaudens: The Portrait Re-
liefs.” A full-scale catalog, designed by Leonard Baskin, reproducing
all reliefs from photographs made especially for this purpose by David
Batchelder and produced by the Meriden Gravure Company, was made
possible by a generous gift from Mr. and Mrs. John E. Marqusee of
New York. The catalog was subsequently issued in book form by Gross-
man Publishers. The exhibition was organized and the catalog written
by John Dryfhout, curator of the Saint Gaudens National Historic
Site in Cornish, New Hampshire.

Two other small exhibitions intended primarily for use in connec-
tion with the Gallery’s secondary school educational program were
held during the year. One was devoted to a portrait of the arctic ex-
plorer Elisha Kent Kane, and the other to Thomas Edison; each por-
trait was hung in a separate gallery surrounded by materials related
to the subject’s life and achievements.

Among the many important acquisitions of the year, several deserve
special mention. A magnificent life portrait of John Randolph of
Roanoke by John Wesley Jarvis was given by Mrs. G. B. Lambert, a
descendant of the artist; and a fine oil of General Horatio Gates by
James Peale (after Charles Willson Peale) was acquired by the Gal-
lery partly with its own funds and partly through a generous gift
from Mr. Lawrence Fleischman. Through the kind offices of a member
of the npc Commision, Wilmarth Sheldon Lewis, Gardner Cox pre-
sented the Gallery with his moving study of Robert F. Kennedy, as
well as two original sketches for the work, which were done from life
in February 1968. Other notable acquisitions included a portrait of
Daniel of Saint Thomas Jenifer by John Hesselius, acquired from a
descendant of the subject; a handsome version in marble of Giuseppi
Cerrachi’s portrait bust of George Washington in Roman garb; a
Sharples pastel of Alexander Hamilton; an oil of Bret Harte by John
Pettie, the best-known likeness of the author; a portrait of Mathew
Brady by Thomas LeClear, one of only two known oils of the master
American photographer; and Adolfo Muller-Ury’s pastel of Lillian
Russell, which was included in the Gallery’s opening exhibition.
HISTORY AND ART 79

Twenty-four acquisitions were transfers from the National Collec-
tion of Fine Arts through the generous cooperation of the Commission
and Director of that sister institution. These works included portraits
of President John Tyler by George P. A. Healy and of George Catlin
by William Fisk.

Joseph H. Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden

By its Act of 7 November 1966, Congress accepted the Joseph H.
Hirshhorn collection as a gift to the United States. Congress also ap-
proved a site on the Mall for the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture
Garden and provided statutory authority for the appropriation of con-
struction and operating funds.

In 1968 the 90th Congress provided contract authority and an
initial $2,000,000 for construction; in 1969, an additional $3,300,000
was appropriated. The ground-breaking ceremony, led by former
President Johnson was held on 8 January 1969. Construction com-
menced in 1970. The public opening of the Joseph H. Hirshhorn
Museum and Sculpture Garden is scheduled for 1972-1973.

The world-renowned sculptures in the Hirshhorn collection range
historically from antiquity to the present. The depth of representation
of major sculptors of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries is unique.
The paintings in the collection are primarily twentieth century. Be-
ginning with such precursors as Thomas Eakins and Winslow Homer,

HISTORY AND ART 81

the course of American painting is extensively covered. Complement-
ing the American section is a strong group of significant European
paintings of the past three decades.

For museum officials, scholars, students, and publishers, the Hirsh-
horn collection continues to be a major source of documentation in the
field of modern art. In 1970 the curatorial staff replied to 190 requests
for research information and photographs. More than one hundred
scholars, artists, and officials visited the Museum office and warehouse
in New York. The loan program is severely curtailed during the
present interim period; nonetheless, 65 paintings and sculptures were
loaned to 30 museums, galleries, and institutions. Approximately 2000
persons attended 23 benefit tours for educational, cultural, and phil-
anthropic organizations at the Hirshhorn Sculpture Garden in
Connecticut.

In 1970, the Hirshhorn Museum staff formulated plans for the selec-
tion and preparation of the paintings and sculpture for the opening
exhibition, as well as for the future programs of the Hirshhorn
Museum.

Cooper-Hewitt Museum of Decorative
Arts and Design

The Museum’s long history in the Cooper Union Building will soon
come to a close. A new home has been obtained for the Museum—the
historic Andrew Carnegie Mansion on 90th Street and Fifth Avenue.
The Mansion will provide five times more space than the present
location and allow for a great expansion of collections, programs, and
services. The staff has worked hard to make the Museum’s last year at
Cooper Union an interesting one, while at the same time planning for
the move to “Museum Row” on upper Fifth Avenue.

When the Cooper-Hewitt relocates this summer it will take along
1315 new objects acquisitioned in the past year. The most significant
of these are seventy-three drawings, watercolors, and oil sketches by
William Stanley Haseltine; twenty-nine theatre designs by Oliver
Smith; quilted bed cover of 18th-century Indian Chintz; 16th-century
Persian double cloth; 14th-century Peruvian tied and dyed net; exam-
ples of ikat from various parts of the world; wall hangings by Arthur
Crisp and Theo Moorman; six Lalique and two Daum vases; Bent-
92 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

wood console table by Michael Thonet; lacquered coffee table by Jean
Durand; two Louis XV armchairs and an 18th-century French settee;
collection of 18th- and 19th-century wallpapers, including one of the
earliest known examples of a labeled 18th-century American wall-
paper; and a Morris & Co. wallpaper sample book of 1890.

The Library acquired 418 new books, approximately half through
gifts. The most notable of these are 95 books on architecture and the
decorative arts presented by the Cooper Union Library and an im-
portant collection of books on wallpaper and textiles.

The special exhibitions presented in the past year include “Kabuki
Prints” ; “Contemporary Japanese Posters”; “A Stately Pleasure Dome:
The Royal Pavilion at Brighton”; “Light and Line: Etchings by
Rembrandt”; “Posters by E. McKnight Kauffer, 1890-1954”; “Con-
temporary Drawings by New York Artists” and the beautiful farewell
exhibition, “India Chintz,’ made possible through a grant from The
JDR 3rd Fund. Alice Baldwin Beer prepared Trade Goods: A Study
and Catalogue of Indian Chintz in the Cooper-Hewitt Museum of
Decorative Arts and Design, Smithsonian Institution to accompany the
exhibition.

“E. McKnight Kauffer Posters” from the collection were shown at
the 18M Gallery in New York and “Master Drawings: The Kingdom
of the Two Sicilies” at the Finch College Museum. Objects from the
Decorative Arts Department were displayed at five branches of the
East River Savings Bank in New York City. “Please Be Seated,’ an
exhibition of chairs throughout history is being circulated by the
American Federation of Arts following its opening in New York. A
total of 254 objects was loaned to institutions in this country and
abroad. Long-term loans of 129 additional objects were arranged with
the Fogg Art Museum at Harvard, the Brooklyn Museum, the Phila-
delphia Museum of Art, and museums of the Smithsonian Institution.

Mrs. Lisa Suter Taylor, former program director of the Smithsonian
Associates, was appointed Director in October, replacing Dr. Richard
Wunder, who is on sabbatical leave. Mr. Leo Arffman was engaged to
administer the capital development program.

The Cooper-Hewitt was visited by over 10,000 persons, of whom
1372 consulted curatorial departments or the library about specific
projects. Tours were given to twenty-two school groups and a twelve-
week adult education course was offered in conjunction with New
York University.

The architectural firm of Hardy, Holzman and Pfeiffer was com-
missioned to prepare a program plan for the relocation of the Muse-
HISTORY AND ART 83

um. During the renovation of the Mansion, major portions of the
collection will be shown at other museums. The staff and study collec-
tions will be housed in Miller House, a townhouse adjoining the
Carnegie Mansion. All available resources and energy will be directed

to the planning of a vital and meaningful new institution—a national

museum of design.

National Armed Forces Museum
Advisory Board

At the Advisory Board’s recommendation, a legislative proposal to
establish a national historical museum park to be designated Bicen-
tennial Park, has been forwarded to the Bureau of the Budget. Reflect-
ing President Eisenhower’s belief in the need for a national museum
devoted to the historic commitment of the American people to the
cause of freedom, the park will be a living outdoor museum, bringing
to present-day Americans a sense of the spirit that drove our forebears
to conceive a new nation within the majestic framework of the Decla-
ration of Independence.

At rural Fort Foote, in Prince George’s County, Maryland, Bicen-
tennial Park will enable visitors to see, hear, handle, smell, and taste
life as known by our 18th-century ancestors. With emphasis focused on
the Revolutionary War citizen-soldier—his background, his motives,
and the labor, sacrifice and self-reliance demanded in the struggle to
bring forth the first modern republic—Bicentennial Park will be
essentially an animated museum, portraying the daily camp duties
while craftsmen demonstrate their trades in the tailor and shoemaker
shops and at the smithy and armory. The rumble of wagons, the clank
of forge, odors of woodsmoke and picket line, the heft of tools and
weapons, muted shades of coarse homespun and flashing colors of
silken standards, all will envelop the visitor in the long-vanished world
of young America.

Colorful reviews to a Continental “band of musick” will be held on
the parade ground, along with such other activities as folk dancing,
pageants, and theatricals—all reflecting the customs and traditions of
our Revolutionary forebears, black and white, townsmen, farmers,
backwoodsmen, seafarers, artisans, merchants, and professional men.
84 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

Woodrow Wilson International Center
for Scholars

During fiscal year 1970 the Woodrow Wilson International Center
for Scholars, created by the Congress in October 1968 to be a living
memorial “expressing the ideals and concerns of Woodrow Wilson ...
symbolizing and strengthening the fruitful relation between the world
of learning and the world of public affairs” did work preparatory to
opening its doors in October of 1970.

After some months of study, the presidential mixed private-public
Board of Trustees headed by former Vice President Hubert H. Hum-
phrey, approved at its fall meeting the opening of new fellowship and
guest-scholar programs in prime space that has been offered to the
Center in the newly renovated Smithsonian Institution Building. The
theme of the fellowship program is designed to accentuate those
aspects of Wilson’s ideals and concerns for which he is perhaps best
remembered a half century after his presidency: his search for interna-
tional peace and the imaginative new governmental approaches he
used to meet pressing issues of his day. In the opening period the
Board plans to stimulate particularly substantial studies on (1) the
development of international understanding, law, and cooperation in
ocean space; and (2) man’s relations with and his response to his
deteriorating environment, with special attention to the new forms
of international cooperation needed to address effectively those envi-
ronmental problems that transcend boundaries.

When the program is fully operational, up to forty distinguished
scholars—approximately half from the United States and half from
other countries—will be selected to work and study for periods ranging
from a few weeks to several years. They will be chosen—again in
approximately equal geographic measure—from many traditional
academic disciplines and from a variety of nonacademic occupations
and professions such as government, law, business, labor, and
journalism.

During the past fiscal year, Director Benjamin H. Read and a small
staff prepared to Jaunch the program, determining policies, publiciz-
ing and getting support for the program, recruiting and selecting the
first fellowship recipients, initiating a private fund-raising campaign,
and working in other ways to breathe life into this newest of presiden-
tial memorial institutions.
HISTORY AND ART 85

Office of American Studies

The Office of American Studies conducts a formal graduate program
which is directed to the original Smithsonian purpose: “the increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men.” During the past year, thirty
graduate students from five universities participated in the Program,
gaining academic credit toward advanced degrees at those universities.
Three courses were offered by the American Studies staff during the
year. The introductory seminar, “Material Aspects of American Civil-
zation,’ this year examined American culture as it has been self-
consciously displayed at world’s fairs and international expositions. A
two-semester seminar, “The Physical City: Approaches to American
Urban History,” taught in conjunction with a visiting urban historian,
Dana F. White, offered students an opportunity to study the American
city as a physical artifact. During the spring semester, students
enrolled in a seminar on “Material Aspects of Cultural History” un-
dertook an archeological excavation on Theodore Roosevelt Island in

New Hampshire under the sponsorship of the George Washington University-
Smithsonian program in American Studies.

the Potomac in conjunction with members of the staff of the National
Museum of History and Technology. In addition to the formal courses
listed above, a number of students in the program carried on individ-
ual research and study under the direction of members of the Smith-
sonian’s curatorial staff. Studies pursued included industrial and
historical archeology, the history of photography, and the material
culture of the period of the American Revolution.

While conducting a program of graduate education, staff members
of the Office of American Studies continued research in several areas,
such as 19th-century politics as revealed by an analysis of symbols and
mottoes on hand-painted campaign banners; a biographical dictionary
of American civil engineers; technology, architecture, and urbaniza-
tion; early exploration; the history of cartography; and Indian-White
relations. The political banners project was outlined in a paper by
Wilcomb E. Washburn at the annual meeting of the Organization of
American Historians in April 1970. In January 1970, Harold Skram-
stad presented a paper discussing “The Engineer as Architect” at the
annual meeting of the Society of Architectural Historians. Several
papers by the staff, based on earlier research, were published during
the year.

The Joseph Henry Papers

In 1970 the Henry Papers received an enormous influx of microfilm
and xerox copies of documents and was able to add more than 4000 of
these to its computer-control system. Most of these documents were
from Henry’s Princeton years, 1833-1846, and the early days of the
Smithsonian Institution, 1847-1852.

At the same time, the staff was engaged in the necessary prelimi-
naries for preparing the first volume of a major documentary publica-
tion. By far the most laborious (and most elementary) activity was a
careful review of documents from Henry’s Albany period, 1792-1832,
to winnow chaff. Documents surviving this review are being edited for
textual accuracy and their contents researched to provide meaningful
annotations for readers. The first volume will not only depict a young
man developing into a significant scientist but will also provide a
documentary précis of the social and intellectual setting for this
development.
HISTORY AND ART 87

Albany in Henry’s day was a lively provincial center, not too much
different from similar localities in the United States. By focusing
intensely on one man’s rise, the Henry Papers will illuminate some of
the factors in his immediate environment and the society at large
affecting our nation’s development.

HROUGH THE YEAR’S WORK there ran a strong current of service

to the community of interests and objectives of the world’s
museums. The preservation of every nation’s heritage and the desire
to engage museums in action roles in education, cultural development,
and the enhancement of the quality of life have become increasingly
the common interests of museum professionals everywhere. The Smith-
sonian has directly and indirectly aided the Department of State,
uNnEsco, and the International Council of Museums to press on
with efforts to rally museum action to suppress unethical practices in
acquiring objects of art, antiquities, and cultural history. Wider cir-
culation was given to codes of acceptable conduct of scientific and
archeological expeditions respecting the natural and cultural resources
of host countries and the encouragement of cooperation with counter-
part scholars and institutions. The General Counsel continued to
guide the legislation, now enacted, to authorize the adherence of the
United States to the International Centre for the Preservation and the
Restoration of Cultural Property (the Rome center).

Assistance was given to the efforts of the American Association of
Museums and the United States National Committee of the Interna-
tional Council of Museums to coordinate their interests in the world
community of museums and to improve communications between mu-
seum professionals everywhere. Advice and guidance have been pro-
vided to the director of the recently established World Museum
Fund designed to encourage international support of museum purposes.

Foreign museum professionals and cultural and scientific personnel
in large numbers continued to consult with colleagues at the Smithson-
ian. They came for advice in establishing national programs of mu-
seum-based sciences, as well as to consult with the personnel of con-
servation and exhibits laboratories, the Registrar, and many others on
museum functions, techniques, and administration. Some of this
appears in the reports that follow. The Conservation Analytical Lab-
oratory, for example, provided consultation and demonstrations to
more than thirty foreign colleagues who came from Italy, Pakistan,
Jordan, Germany, Nigeria, Guinea, India, Mexico, Belgium, Ja-
maica, Venezuela, England, Iran, Taiwan, Canada, and elsewhere.

9? SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

Office of the Director General of Museums

The past year has seen an intensifying of the need of museums and
their professional organizations to improve and carry out programs
which, in the words of the National Museum Act, are “necessary to
insure that museum resources for preserving and interpreting the na-
tion’s heritage may be more fully utilized in the enrichment of public
life in the individual community.” Cooperation with museums in
America and abroad, continued emphasis upon museum training and
exhibit effectiveness, and an increased concern for the world commu-
nity of museums have characterized the activities of the Office of the
Director General.

The Director General, under the authority of the Museum Act, has
responded to an ever-increasing number of requests for technical assis-
tance and advice from museums in this country and overseas. Re-
sponse under the act has varied from consultant activities to support
of international symposiums, as well as to the direct assistance of mu-
seum programs with national implication such as the American Asso-
ciation of Museums’ study of museum accreditation. Under the general
provisions of the act, members of the Smithsonian’s scientific and
curatorial staff have aided the Oakland Museum, California; the Buf-
falo Museum of Science, New York; the New York State Museum at
Albany, and such nascent institutions as the Virginia Museum of
Science.

Essential to providing adequate information and advice has been
the continuing accumulation of data pertinent to museums and their
missions. The Director General has cooperated with the American
Association of Museums and the United States Department of Educa-
tion in gathering and refining statistical data relating to museums.
Within the Smithsonian, interviewing of visitors to the National Mu-
seum of History and Technology and the National Museum of Natural
History for the year-long Smithsonian visitor survey was completed in
October. Volunteer interviewers have questioned more than 5000
visitors and the Smithsonian’s Information Systems Division has com-
pleted card-punching of their responses. Programmed use of this data
will permit an analysis of our visitors and their experiences at the
Smithsonian.

Training has continued as an important adjunct of the National
Museum Act. Over 1600 persons from both domestic and foreign
institutions have received advice on exhibition techniques and in the
general principles of museum management. Cooperation with the Art
Department of Fisk University, Nashville, Tennessee, resulted in a
SPECIAL MUSEUM PROGRAMS 93

student planned and supervised exhibition on the black ghetto, first
shown at the National Museum of History and Technology in August
of 1969. At another level of involvement, the Office of the Director
General, in concert with the Office of Academic Programs conducted
a symposium: “Opportunities for Extending Museum Contributions
to Pre-College Science Education.” Supported by the National Science
Foundation, forty-five invited participants met at the Belmont Con-
ference Center 26-27 January 1970. The proceedings of the symposium
will be published in book form.

Internally, the Director General has chaired an _Institution-wide
committee charged by the Secretary with the responsibility of review
and study of the future of exhibits at the Smithsonian. The committee
has completed its finding and has prepared its final report and recom-
mendations.

In October, Mr. Taylor and Mr. Welsh attended a meeting of the
1coM International Committee for Museums of Science.and Tech-
nology which was held in India, principally at Bangalore. The purpose
of the meeting was to plan a laboratory with a capability to produce
basic science exhibits designed to meet the specific needs of individual,
developing countries. It is anticipated that a laboratory will be
founded in India at Bangalore and that it will become a depository of
experience, a center of training, and a useful example of international
cooperation among museums. This meeting was the culmination of
several years’ effort and planning by the Director General of Museums
based on the belief that science-teaching exhibits, carefully prepared
and tested, can help bridge the science lag between developed and de-
veloping countries.

The Director General of Museums has furthered the concept and
utilization of the Arts and Industries Building as an Exposition Hall.
The Exposition Hall programs provided a setting for two exhibitions
on urban themes, “Urban Transit: Problem and Promise” and “Urban
Design: Manhattan,’ and an opportunity for the general public to
hear Rai Y. Okamoto, city planner-architect, lecture on urban transit
and its impact. Industrial design students from several major schools
presented in the “New Concepts for Leisure” exhibition their solutions
to diminishing leisure resources and increasing leisure time.

Support from industry made possible the expansion of the traveling
“Plastic as Plastic” exhibition. It demonstrated the historical develop-
ment of plastic in America and emphasized the future of plastics when
shaped by the hands of innovative designers and technicians. An ex-
perimental space enclosure of urethane foam sprayed on stretched cot-
ton jersey fabric, early plastic objects from the Smithsonian collections,
the first all-plastic airplane, an experimental automobile with plastic
94 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

body, an operating injection-molding machine, and “instant vacation
home” were high points of the exhibition.

Significant progress was made this year in coordinating and plan-
ning the Smithsonian’s role in the celebration of the Bicentennial of
the American Revolution. This was accomplished by Mr. John J.
Slocum, special assistant for Bicentennial planning, whose completed
study, with estimates of the various Smithsonian elements expected to
participate in the Bicentennial, has been forwarded to the Secretary of
the Institution. Mr. Slocum continued to serve as a liaison officer be-
tween the Smithsonian, the American Revolution Bicentennial Com-
mission, other government agencies, and private organizations.

Office of Exhibits Programs

The Office of Exhibits Programs collaborates in the production of
exhibits originating in the curatorial, scientific, academic, and public
service programs of the Smithsonian. More than 225 individual proj-
ects were worked on during the year including sixty temporary exhib-
its and upgrading and maintenance in nearly every gallery of the Na-
tional Museum of History and Technology, the National Museum of
Natural History, and the National Air and Space Museum. The exhi-
bitions produced are described in part in the reports of the divisions
and museums in which they originated and are listed in Appendix 8.

The “Laser 10” exhibition was designed and produced by this Office
with the essential assistance of a group of distinguished laser scient-
ists from universities and industry. The scientists planned the exhibi-
tion and assisted in the acquisition of laser instruments and demon-
strations. This exhibit, visited by about 750,000 people in the period
January to June, will remain until the fall of 1970.

The instruction of museum personnel in museum exhibition prac-
tices and techniques continued. A total of twenty-nine persons from ten
states and ten foreign countries received instruction during the year.

Conservation-Analytical Laboratory

Detailed advice on good environments for the preservation of mu-
seum objects and on acceptable methods of cleaning and preserving
SPECIAL MUSEUM PROGRAMS 95

them have been provided to many museums and to the public. Docu-
ments and objects made of such various materials as wood, leather, and
metal—that have been damaged, were in need of cleaning, or subject
to active corrosion or decay—have been repaired and stabilized for each
of the various Smithsonian bureaus.

Two conservators were added to the staff. A visiting research associ-
ate spent an academic year studying methods and materials applicable
to plain and painted African wooden cult objects for use in tropical
areas.

One of the staff has worked briefly at Florence, Italy, on flood-
damaged books and documents. Practical emergency assistance has
been given to a museum damaged by hurricane Camille. Trainees
from the Pacific area have been instructed at Honolulu in conservation
methods. A second series of twenty weekly lectures for Smithsonian
staff attracted up to fifty-six attendees at some sessions.

Innumerable facilities and services were provided to Smithsonian
Museums. Analytical facilities were applied to more than sixty re-
quests from six bureaus. Sensitive neutron-activation analysis is being
applied to characterize American ceramics and also to medieval glass
from the collections, and a method of precise analysis by X-ray fluores-
cence has been developed for museum objects that promises to be of
universal application with a minimum of synthetic standards. A com-
puter terminal was installed to facilitate calculations. Emission spec-
trography and X-ray diffraction also served to analyze such diverse
objects as moon rock, earth minerals, Chinese bronzes, and religious
medals.

Office of the Registrar

In addition to the important function of receiving and recording
specimens and objects into the museums’ collections, the Office of the
Registrar provides services that support the Smithsonian’s research,
education, collection management, and exhibition programs. For all
bureaus of the Smithsonian, these are the shipping operation, the
customs work, central mail activity, travel documents for official
foreign travel, as well as the receipt and control of public inquiries and
official correspondence for the museums.

More than two million pieces of mail were handled, with the Smith-
sonian Associates and the Smithsonian (magazine) generating large
96 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

volumes. Among public inquiries, ecology and man’s environment
captured the interests ranging from that of the youngest school child
to the older citizens as evidenced by letters received.

Shipping activities covered the usual wide diversity of objects, such
as the 30,000-year-old man from Spain, 47,000 pounds of records from
Detroit for the Archives of American Art, the Napoleon diamond
necklace sent as a loan to the Palais du Louvre, and a man-eating
crocodile from the Caroline Islands.

Official travel by staff members and foreign currency grantees ex-
tended to all parts of the world, including Vietnam, Cambodia,
Australia, New Guinea, and Iceland. The Office of the Registrar
obtained 204 passports and 275 visas for 250 travelers.

Smithsonian Institution Traveling
Exhibition Service

During this past fiscal year exhibitions of the Smithsonian Insti-
tuition Traveling Exhibition Service (sires) were shown in all of the
United States with the exceptions of Alaska and Hawai. Seven hun-
dred bookings were viewed by an estimated four to five million people.
Institutions in several Canadian cities also exhibited sires shows.
Smithsonian museums showed eleven of them.

“Contemporary American Black Artists” organized by the National
Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Lee
Nordess Galleries, and ‘““The Art of Henry O. Tanner’ jointly orga-
nized by the Museum of African Art and the National Collection of
Fine Arts were added to the siTEs program this year.

It is encouraging to report a substantial increase in the number of
traveling exhibitions organized during the past year by Smithsonian
units. Two versions of “The Douglass Years” are being circulated in
cooperation with the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum. The following
exhibits originated in the Smithsonian, contain material from Smith-
sonian collections, or were planned and produced by Smithsonian pro-
grams: “Jean Louis Berlandier,” “Photography and The City,” “John
Wesley Powell: The Indomitable Major,” “Werner Drewes Wood-
cuts,” “The People’s Choice,” “The Malay Archipelago,’ and “A
Heritage in Peril—Alaska’s Vanishing Totems.” Modest progress was
made toward a broader program of traveling exhibitions and the ex-
tension of Smithsonian resources to other parts of the United States.
SPECIAL MUSEUM PROGRAMS 97

The Service continues to receive letters of thanks from staff and trus-
tees of museums using the Service, frequently accompanied by press
notices of the interest stimulated in their communities by traveling
exhibits.

This year has been a critical one financially. Srres has been caught
in the squeeze between higher operating costs and lower revenues.
Salaries and other expenses are rising while museums generally are
suffering from inadequate support. Many museums cannot now afford
the larger shows and this has reduced the income of sires dispropor-
tionately. Sires is supported by fees received for its services so it has
had to reduce its operations somewhat to work within its income.

The number of exhibitions in the program has been reduced ten
percent and the staff by about the same percentage. In making these
cutbacks, 42 exhibitions have been dispersed, 32 new ones initiated,
and 67 continued from prior years. Of the new shows initiated this
year, twelve are from other countries. Eighteen of those continued
from last year are also from abroad.

PUBLIC SERVICE AND
INFORMATION ACTIVITIES
-

The worth and importance of the Institution are not to be estimated by what it
accumulates within the walls of its buildings, but by what it sends forth to the
world.
SECRETARY JOSEPH HENRY
Smithsonian Annual Report, 1852

The Institution’s diverse public service activities all have the one
common purpose so well expressed in Secretary Henry’s vision. They
range from the traditional one-page Monthly Calendar of Events to
the newly established Smithsonian magazine, or from a small work-
shop class in enameling to an international conference on arid-land
ecology.

In April of 1970 the Smithsonian took a significant step forward in
sending forth its storehouse of knowledge to the world with the pub-
lication of the monthly Smithsonian magazine. Essentially popular in
character, the magazine was originally conceived as a means of extend-
ing the Smithsonian Associates from a local or Washington-based
membership group to a nationwide audience. With the publication of
the first issue, therefore, the Smithsonian Associates established both
resident and national membership categories. Resident members con-
tinued to receive a varied program of lecture courses, workshops, and
guided tours, as well as an option to subscribe to the magazine at a
reduced rate. National members received the Smithsonian and cer-
tain other benefits, such as a reception center, located in the Great
Hall of the Smithsonian Building, to help plan their visits to Washing-
ton; the opportunity to participate in both domestic and international
study tours; and discounts on Museum Shop articles and Smithsonian
Institution Press publications.

The magazine, ably headed by Edward K. Thompson, former man-
aging editor of Life, and a small editorial staff of seven, reached a
circulation of 180,000 by its fourth issue. It was thus favored by what
many professionals call the most successful start in the recent history
of magazine publishing. Smithsonian’s principal theme is “man: his
environment, sciences, arts, adventures, follies, fortunes.” Each issue,
therefore, carries at least one major article on man’s problems with
his environment, in both humanistic and scientific terms. Within this
environmental context, the magazine seeks to portray and interpret
Smithsonian interests in science, art, and cultural history.

Other major efforts in carrying the Smithsonian Institution beyond

101
102 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

its own walls centered around the medium of television, both public
and commercial. In April the Institution received a generous grant
from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting to produce a general
documentary on the Smithsonian’s various museums and scientific
bureaus for National Educational Television. The film will be adapted
later for continual showings within the Smithsonian for visitor orien-
tation. It thus will fill a long felt need for improved guidance of the
Institution’s visitors. In June the Institution entered into an agree-
ment with the Columbia Broadcasting System for a series of documen-
taries, principally based on the Smithsonian’s overseas scientific expe-
ditions. It is expected that this agreement will provide for the first
time the instrumentality for popular interpretation of the Institution’s
scientific missions to the significant number of listeners attracted by
the evening or prime-time broadcasts of a major network.

Other signal achievements in the work of carrying the Smithson-
ian’s interests beyond its own walls included a new program of urban
problem identification at the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum, sup-
ported by a Carnegie Corporation grant; Office of International Ac-
tivities participation in a Mekong Basin study team, designed to assess
the ecological effects of present and proposed hydroelectrical projects
on the Mekong River; and an Information Systems Division bulletin
published especially for the museum community, showing how auto-
matic data processing can best be applied to museum collections.

Smithsonian Associates

In its fourth year, the Smithsonian Associates continued to create
numerous opportunities for both its members and the general public to
participate in the life of the Smithsonian Institution. More than
40,000 adults and young people were involved in a broad variety of
activities, ranging from special events such as the opening of the exhi-
bition “Laser 10,” Zoo night, and the Folk Festival Preview to in-depth
classes taught primarily by Smithsonian scholars in fields of Smithson-
ian interest.

Programs for members only, more than half of which were without
charge, totaled some 121 separate events, many of which were repeated
by popular demand. Events also open to the public totaled another
111. These activities included lecture courses in history, science, and
the humanities; films, field trips (both outdoors and behind-the-scenes

in the National Museums of History and Technology and Natural
History), exhibit openings, an exploration into conservation of art
objects at the National Collection of Fine Arts, the ever-popular
annual Kite Carnival, a new and well-received workshop on boomer-
ang making and throwing, and numerous concerts and theatrical pro-
ductions, ranging from a play on drug addiction presented by student
members of the Daytop rehabilitation program of New York to a
concert by leading experimenters with the Moag synthesizer and other
electronic instruments. In addition, young people and adults studied in
some 93 classes and craft workshops.

Emphasis was on doing—on learning and growing and “becoming
involved.” Some discussed ecological problems at an Encounter series
while others studied natural history on a schooner cruise off the coast
of Maine, explored archeology at the luncheon series, dug fossils at
Calvert Cliffs, hunted mushrooms in Maryland, and considered the
past through art-history tours in nearby states. As varied and extensive
as these activities have been, they mark only the beginning of the
Associates’ adventure in discovery.

A major event in the history of the Associates occurred in April
with the publication of the first issue of the Smithsonian magazine.
A list of the Smithsonian Associates membership gifts is in Appendix 3.

Office of Public Affairs

The Office of Public Affairs (opA) in the past year broadened its
programs of communication with visitors and the public at large. A
full-time visitor-information desk service was inaugurated in coopera-
tion with the Smithsonian Associates. The Smithsonian Motion Pic-
ture Group undertook three productions: a public television program
about Institution activities under a grant from the Corporation for
Public Broadcasting, a film about museums in modern life, and a con-
temporary study of libraries with the American Library Association. A
half-hour television show, “Smithsonian,” was produced with the
American University Broadcast Center and wrc-tv. Broadcasters fo-
cused increased attention on the Smithsonian, and numerous projects
from modern art to space flight were carried out with opa aid. Radio
Smithsonian, a program series of music and conversation, was carried
regularly by stations in Washington, D.C., and New York City and
distributed nationally and overseas. A publications branch was estab-
PUBLIC SERVICE AND INFORMATION ACTIVITIES 105

lished to initiate and distribute a wide range of printed materials—
including information leaflets, building guides, and foreign-language
material. The News Bureau, charged with communicating day-to-day
developments to news media, prepared a series of “news-features” that
were widely reprinted. The Smithsonian Film Theatre presented 37
weekly programs in art, science, and history attended by more than
25,000 persons. An educational radio internship program was estab-
lished with American University, and the opa also sponsored the third
annual day of staff briefings for student science writers.

Office of International Activities

Office activities were concentrated on the environmental conse-
quences of development, with the Director leading a team of scientists
to the Mekong Basin to assess the ecological effects of present and
proposed hydroelectrical projects there. He also served on the National
Academy of Sciences committee to study the biological consequences of
a sea-level canal in Panama.

The Office assisted Smithsonian scientists in planning research
abroad and briefed American diplomats going overseas and foreign
visitors to the Institution on its international programs. Museum
training for three Africans was arranged, a symposium on Smithsonian
projects in Ceylon was successfully carried out and two Smithsonian
staff members were sent to Iran as consultants under the Iran-United
States Science Agreement, the first such international agreement in
which the Smithsonian has been designated as the program-directing
agency. Staff members visited more than twelve nations to arrange
new cooperative programs.

Closing its fifth year, the Foreign Currency Program had awarded
more than $10,000,000 in “excess” foreign currency grants to over fifty
American institutions of higher learning, of which $3,500,000 was
awarded this year alone. Grants included more than the equivalent of
five million dollars for work in archeology and related disciplines;
over three and one half million in systematic and environmental
biology; more than $400,000 in astrophysics and earth sciences; and
nearly $150,000 in the newly authorized category of Museum
programs.

Program accomplishments over the five-year period include some
90 research publications, 150 postdoctoral research opportunities for
106 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

Americans, 110 field-training opportunities for doctoral candidates,
and research collections for the Smithsonian and many of the Ameri-
can grantee institutions. The bi-national collaborative research pattern
fostered by the program contributed in a similar beneficial way to 200
foreign host institutions.

A list of the grants awarded in fiscal year 1970 is included in
Appendix 1.

Division of Performing Arts

The Division of Performing Arts continued to enliven and enrich
the experience of museum visitors with a variety of programs and
projects. “Perceptions II,’ a series of contemporary forms in perform-
ing arts, now in its second year, highlighted the world premiers of two
musical works. One of them, “Misfortunes of the Immortals” by Mor-
ton Subotnick, has been added to the permanent repertoire of the
Dorian Woodwind Quintet. The series also included two powerful and
timely dramatic works: “The Concept,” dealing with the endeavors of
former drug addicts to reenter society; and ‘‘Neighbors,” a rock musical
based on the Spoon River Anthology. “Perceptions” is presented in
cooperation with the Smithsonian Associates.

The third annual Festival of American Folklife was again the most
popular single event on the Mall. More than half a million visitors
were once again reminded of their own cultural roots by the exhibits
of crafts and cooking and performances of music and dance. A special
section was devoted to the craft and music of the State of Pennsylvania.

The Touring Performances Service, in the second year, sponsored a
wide range of American performing artists and lecturers at cultural
and educational institutions across the country. The American Folklife
Company, The Black Experience, the touring Smithsonian Puppet
Theatre, The Jelly Roll Memorial Band, The Concept, and other
programs disseminated the experience and success of the Smithsonian
in the field of performing arts.

The Resident Puppet Theater, an exceedingly popular informative
entertainment for children, continued during 1970 with three new
shows in expanded facilities. One hundred and forty colleges and uni-
versities submitted their productions to the American College Theatre
Festival, and the ten best were then restaged in Washington, D.C., to
PUBLIC SERVICE AND INFORMATION ACTIVITIES 107

general critical acclaim. The Division also presented programs in
cooperation with other organizations: A series of concerts was offered
monthly with the Left Bank Jazz Society, and chamber music concerts
with the Washington Performing Arts Society, as well as an evening
of Brazilian folk music with the the Brazilian Embassy, among others.

Smithsonian Museum Shops

The Smithsonian Museum Shops installations in all museums were
completed during the last year. Special efforts were made to expand
the role of the book stores of the Museum Shops.

Facilities for publications were increased in the Shops of the Arts
and Industries Building (Aa1) and the National Museum of History
and Technology (NMuT). A special sales area for the “‘Contributions
to the Museum of History and Technology” was installed at NmuT and
all Shops offered specially selected publications focused on the special
exhibits of each museum.

The Museum Shops once more participated in the Folklife Festival
on the Mall in July of 1969 offering items of traditional American
crafts. The Second Annual Aerospace Modeling Exhibit was held in
the shop of the Arts and Industries Building sponsored by the National
Air and Space Museum and the Museum Shops, which included a
weekend launching competition on the Mall of model rocket and flight
craft.

The sales exhibitions program of the Museum Shops was high-
lighted with the introduction of a new series of exhibitions honoring
the crafts and craftsmen of the United States in February when the
works of thirty-four distinguished craftsmen from Montana were
shown in the Museum Shop in agar. Other special sales exhibitions
offered the public an opportunity to select crafts from Pakistan and
Chile; flat-woven rugs from Greece, Iran, and Turkey; wooden circus
toys made by William Accorsi; and animals in iron sculpture by

Orvello Wood.

Belmont Conference Center

The Belmont Conference Center, now in its fourth year of full oper-
ation, continues to grow and to find itself scheduling conferences at an
108 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

ever-increasing rate. At the present time, groups are reserving the
Center as far as a year in advance. During the past year, fifty-eight
conferences met at Belmont, sponsored by thirty-three agencies (gov-
ernmental as well as public and private organizations) .

Smithsonian groups holding conferences at Belmont have included
the Smithsonian Council, Interdisciplinary Communications Program,
Office of Academic Programs, Program for Postdoctoral Fellows in
Education Research, and the Office of International Activities. The
Center has been host to groups as diversified as the National Urban
Coalition and the Senate Public Works Committee, while guests have
included Nobel Prize winner Dr. Murray Gell-Mann; Dr. John Clark,
Director of Goddard Space Flight Center; Dr. Robert Marston, Direc-
tor of National Institutes of Health; Mr. Robert Mayo, Counsellor to
the President; Mr. Elmer Staats, Comptroller General; Dr. John
Gardner, Chairman, National Urban Coalition; and Commissioner
Nicholas Johnson of the Federal Communications Commission, to
name a few of the more than 1,000 persons who have been welcomed
to Belmont this past year.

The Center accommodates twenty-four resident guests with facilities
for meetings and meals for thirty people. The completion of a new
roof, as well as extensive repairs to the main house and other build-
ings, has made Belmont more comfortable and attractive.

Conference operations continue to be directed toward the needs of
small groups which require the kind of attractive and secluded setting
which Belmont provides, together with the advantages of easy access to
Washington’s National and Baltimore’s Friendship airports.

Anacostia Neighborhood Museum

Highlights in the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum’s 1970 pro-
grams included the exhibit “The Rat: Man’s Invited Affliction,’ which
focused on the environmental problem of rat infestation and how to
deal with it. A simulated backyard was especially constructed so that
the viewer could see how live rats live and breed. This exhibit received
nationwide attention when it was filmed for the asc television pro-
gram “Discovery.” A portion of the exhibit was shown at the Buffalo
Museum of Science under the cosponsorship of that museum and the
Buffalo County Health Department. The impact of “The Rat” rein-
forced the conviction that the Anacostia Neighborhood Museum
PUBLIC SERVICE AND INFORMATION ACTIVITIES 109

should be a mechanism for change in the inner city. A proposal was
submitted, and in May of this year, the Carnegie Corporation granted
the Museum $100,000 ‘“‘to enable the staff to work with neighborhood
groups in analyzing urban problems and their effect on the neighbor-
hood and to make information and educational materials on these
issues available to schools, museums, and other local and national
groups.”

In cooperation with the sires, the Museum’s exhibit on Frederick
Douglass and his influence on Afro-American history, “The Douglass
Years,” has been shown at various museums throughout the country.

During the major part of the school year, over 23,000 children and
teenagers visited the Museum on guided school tours. Films and var-
ious programs of educational and popular interest were presented with
each new exhibit. The Mobile Division reached approximately 6600
students during visits to area schools with a condensed version of “The
Douglass Years.”

Special exhibit “The Rat: Man’s Invited Affliction” at the Anacostia Neighbor-
hood Museum, focused on the environmental problem of rat infestation and how
to deal with it.

Smithsonian

The Smithsonian magazine, born of the Institution’s desire to extend
the Smithsonian Associates into a nationwide membership organization,
published its first issue in April of 1970. It soon achieved a circulation
of 180,000.

The editorial office, located in the Arts and Industries Building, is
headed by Edward K. Thompson. Before coming to Washington, Mr.
Thompson served for ten years as managing editor of Life magazine,
after which he became editor of all Life publications. In this capacity
he was largely responsible for launching a well-known Life books
program.

With Mr. Thompson on the Board of Editors of Smithsonian are
Ralph T. Backlund, formerly associate and managing editor of Horizon
magazine; R. Hobart Ellis, who has served as editor of various scientific
publications, including Nucleonics, Nuclear Fusion, and Physics Today;
Edward Parks, formerly editor of several magazines in Australia and
associate director of the National Geographic’s book department; and
Mrs. Grayce P. Northcross, who has done research and reporting for
Time, Life, and the United States Information Agency’s America.

The magazine’s advertising, circulation, and promotion offices are in
New York City. Heading the New York office is advertising director
Thomas H. Black, formerly sales executive with J. Walter Thompson,
asc, Life, and Time; assisted by general manager Joseph J. Bonsig-
nore, previously head of editorial production for Life, Fortune, Time,
and Sports Illustrated; and circulation-promotion director Anne Keat-
ing, formerly advertising and promotion director of Natural History.

Early articles to attract national attention concerned the Crown-
of-Thorns starfish infestation of Pacific coral reefs, the history of our
volunteer armies, and a historical appraisal of women’s rights move-
ments. Smithsonian scientists and staff members contributing to
Smithsonian included Dr. John Eisenberg of the National Zoological
Park, James Weaver of the National Museum of History and Tech-
nology’s Division of Musical Instruments, and photographer Francis
Greenwell of the National Museum of Natural History. In addition,
Regent Crawford H. Greenewalt contributed an article, with his own
photographs, on Birds of Paradise.

An early letter to the editor perhaps best sums up the broad appeal
and the unique character of Smithsonian. The writer, a high school
graduate and heavy-equipment operator, asked:
PUBLIC SERVICE AND INFORMATION ACTIVITIES 111

I would like to see occasional articles on native and primitive art... plus at
least one good article on heraldry ...and definitions of the items involved in
this form of art.

Edward Thompson has stated that Smithsonian will not disappoint
him or its other readers.

Smithsonian Institution Archives

The Archive’s major obligations are preservation of the materials in
its custody and announcement of the availability of three resources to
scholars. At present physical work predominates; records are separated
into discrete units, cleaned, boxed, and shelved. During this arrange-
ment process a limited amount of information is also collected about
each record or manuscript unit, and in Jaunary 1971 this information
will be issued as the first comprehensive finding aid to the Archives’
holdings. Description of records in depth has begun and will proceed
according to the research importance of the materials. A full guide to
the Smithsonian Archives will appear in about four years.

The program for physical arrangement and production of good
quality-finding aids will create information which can be computerized
simply and effectively. When information of sufficient quality about
the collections has been assembled, the Archives will be prepared for
computerized finding aids to complement information systems within
other divisions of the Smithsonian and national systems for manu-
script collections.

In March 1970 the Archives occupied its newly remodeled space in
the Smithsonian Institution Building. Reference service was provided
to a wide range of users. Drs. Charles G. Abbot and Alexander Wet-
more made arrangements for transfer of their personal Secretarial
papers to the Smithsonian. This was the highlight of the year and
undoubtedly ranks among the most important transactions in the
history of the Smithsonian Archives.

Smithsonian Institution Libraries

The Smithsonian Institution and the National Agricultural Library
conducted a facsimile transmission experiment to augment delivery
2 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

service between the two libraries. Permanent transmission services
await staff augmentation. The Libraries produced an exhibit, to be
available through the Traveling Exhibition Service (sires) commem-
orating the 100th anniversary of the publication of Alfred Wallace’s
The Malay Archipelago. The first American Library Association tu-
torial program on basic library automation was conducted by the
Smithsonian Libraries, with the District of Columbia Library Associa-
tion as a cosponsor. The Institution was elected to its third consecutive
two-year term on the Federal Library Committee.

Reduced buying power of funds for the purchase of library materials
heightened the importance of the Libraries’ gift and exchange pro-
gram. A new review process was organized and subject experts on the
Libraries’ staff selected over 5,000 items for retention from among the
many items received this year. This effort was capped by a valuable
gift of historical items in botany by Mr. Harry Lubrecht of New York
City. Processing was begun of the rare books in the Dwight-Tucker
ornithological collection and the task of recataloging the Department
of Anthropology Library reached the halfway mark in 1970.

A long-range solution to space problems for the curation of the
Libraries’ collections was reached through the creation of the Smith-
sonian Institution Library Center away from the Mall in the Institu-
tion’s Lamont Street building. The Center will hold the growing
number of large and special collections, particularly for historical re-
search. Library space in Mall buildings will be devoted to reference
and concentrated research collections. The large collection transferred
to the Smithsonian from the Patent Office last year was moved im-
mediately to the Center.

International Exchange Service

Publications weighing more than 700,000 pounds were received
from over 370 organizations in the United States for exchange with
libraries in other countries. Exchange publications weighing approxi-
mately 500,000 pounds were forwarded by ocean freight to 39 exchange
bureaus in 32 countries, and approximately 200,000 pounds were
mailed to addressees in countries that do not have exchange bureaus.
More than 120,000 pounds were received in exchange from the foreign
exchange bureaus for addressees in the United States.

Some 350,000 pounds of official United States publications were ex-
changed for the official documents of other countries. Recipients in 45
countries received the full sets of official publications, and partial sets
PUBLIC SERVICE AND INFORMATION ACTIVITIES 113

were sent to recipients in 34 countries. The official journals, the Con-
gresstonal Record, and the Federal Register were sent on exchange to
65 countries. United States patent specifications were exchanged with
patent libraries in 24 countries.

Medical and dental publications were received from more than 180
libraries in the United States for exchange with medical and dental
libraries in other countries.

During the year the United States Department of Agriculture and
the Geological Survey discontinued using the Service for the mailing
list portions of their exchange programs.

Information Systems Division

The Information Systems Division, staffed with specialists in re-
trieval and indexing techniques, mathematical computation, and
management information services, continues to provide Smithsonian
museologists and management with technical assistance in all areas of
automation. In addition to the continuing research and development
of new applications and the maintenance of existing systems, several
computer systems were implemented during the year to handle the
diverse information needs of the Institution.

A generalized software package was developed to establish a mu-
seum data file within the Smithsonian, based on a standard means of
recording and updating information. Additional calculation capabili-
ties have been offered to Smithsonian scientists with the development
of a library of advanced mathematical software packages. The Divi-
sion also sponsored seminars in statistical applications to enhance the
value of these computer programs. A system was designed and imple-
mented to combine all personnel and payroll data into one readily
accessible file. Other systems began operating this year to provide rec-
ord-management procedures for library serials, oceanographic rock
samples, and fine-arts inventory, and another to report accumulating
cost and workload data for labor and materials at all management
levels.

As a service to the museum community at large, the Division began
publishing a technical bulletin dedicated to acquainting the reader
with automated systems specifically designed to solve the collection
problems of museums and herbaria. In addition, many members of the
114 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

community from both home and abroad attended demonstrations of
the now operating Smithsonian Institution information retrieval
system for handling biological and petrological data in all their
complexities.

Smithsonian Institution Press

The publication programs of the Smithsonian Institution Press were
reviewed in March by a visiting committee of four prominent pub-
lishers. The committee concluded that the Smithsonian is meeting ade-
quately its mandate for diffusion of knowledge to scholars through
publication of research reports and catalogs, but that communication
to a broader audience is not as well organized or as effective. The com-
mittee proposed an organic program of publication on three levels:
(1) leaflets, available at the exhibits of public museums, for the pur-
pose of exhibit interpretation; (2) booklets and other educational
materials, to be produced and distributed by cooperation with other
publishers, for the purpose of extension to schools and communities;
and (3) adult books, related to Smithsonian programs and interests,
for the purpose of reviewing and integrating significant information in
science, history, and art. This plan was reviewed by the Press staff,
the standing Editorial Policy Committee, the Secretary, and the
bureau directors, all of whom gave it their strong endorsements and
approvals for implementation commencing in fiscal 1971.

Arrangements with Random House, Inc. for sales and distribution
of privately funded books in the United States and Canada were termi-
nated at the end of the year. A new contract for these services was
executed with George Braziller, Inc.

Production costs of 111 publications were funded by federal appro-
priation in the amount of $374,497; 11 were supported by Smith-
sonian private funds in the amount of $89,996; and 12 were sub-
sidized by grants of gifts in the amount of $43,157. The total out-
put of 134 titles is listed in Appendix 5. The Press warehouse and
Random House shipped, on order and subscription, a total of 256,000
publications during the year.
PUBLIC SERVICE AND INFORMATION ACTIVITIES 115

Science Information Exchange

Beginning its second decade, the Science Information Exchange
(stz) has continued to expand its services to the national scientific
community. About 100,000 records of currently active research are
received annually and from this automated data bank, thousands of
inquiries are being answered to assist research investigators and ad-
ministrators in the planning and management of the projects and
programs. During 1970 there has been a significant increase in
demands for complex multi-disciplinary, multi-agency compilations
that describe the details of broad programs of national importance,
such as water resources, marine sciences, environmental pollution, and
outdoor recreation. These compilations, including thousands of related
projects, are being furnished as computer listings, printed catalogs, and
tables of data or matrices showing the distribution of research effort
over the appropriate subspecialties of complex programs.

Interest in the international exchange of information of this kind
appears to be increasing, although most announced systems still seem
to be in planning stages. A registry of Scientific and Technical Services
among nine Asiatic nations, however, is currently operational in
Australia, and a one-year experimental exchange arrangement has
been initiated between sir and the International Atomic Energy com-
mission in Vienna.

The Exchange has progressed substantially toward a_ systems-
network capability. About half of the total project input is now being
received on compatible machine-readable tape capable of two way
exchange. Eight keyboard visual screen terminals are now connected
directly to the automated data bank and could be connected through
leased lines whenever remote real time access is deemed desirable and
economically feasible. Within a few months, the full text of all sir
records will be available in the computer store.

Reading Is Fundamental

The National Reading Is Fundamental program (riF) has oper-
ated since 1968 as an independent unit under Smithsonian sponsorship
and is supported by the Ford Foundation. RiF’s purpose is to motivate
disadvantaged youngsters and adults to want to read, by making avail-
able a wide variety of interesting and relevant inexpensive paperbacks.
116 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

(member of rir National Advisory Board), far right; Joseph D. Burrucker,
Director, Cleveland-rir, standing next to the Mayor; and Jerrold Sandler,
Executive Director, National rir Program, far left. Spring, 1970.

The program stresses self-selection and ownership of books in the belief
that the right to read should be the birthright of all America’s chil-
dren. Under the Ford grant, riF provides technical assistance and
information to those interested in beginning a local project—school
systems, libraries, and community agencies.

During 1969-1970 eleven model projects were developed, covering
both urban and rural areas throughout the country, and including
various ethnic groups—American Indians, Blacks, and Mexican-Ameri-
cans. All funds for books, as well as the selection of titles, were the
responsibility of the local sponsoring groups. Areas covered included
Cleveland; Pittsburgh; Appalachia, Mississippi; New York City; East
Los Angeles; St. Louis; Eastern Shore, Maryland; Columbus, Ohio;
and Washington, D. C. In addition to these model projects, the Read-
ing Is Fundamental central staff acts as liaison with the publishing
industry, government, schools, and libraries regarding book programs
and provides general information to all who seek it.

Two major publications were completed during the year for wide
distribution: Action for Change, a pictorial booklet describing the
PUBLIC SERVICE AND INFORMATION ACTIVITIES 7

national program, and riF’s Guide to Book Selection, including more
than 1700 titles and 1100 authors, with special sections dealing with
materials of relevance to the ethnic groups served. Future plans call
for the development of guidelines for setting up a RIF program and
development of a new film for distribution via television and com-
munity organizations showing the program in action.

The Ford Foundation will continue to support RIF as a Smithsonian
activity through a renewal grant of $400,000 for the three-year period,
1970-1973. Policy guidance for r1F is provided by a National Advisory
Board composed of more than thirty distinguished Americans from
many walks of life. The founder and chairman of rir is Mrs. Robert
S. McNamara; Secretary Ripley serves ex officio as a member of the
RIF board.

OFFICE OF ACADEMIC: PROGRAMS
814 ARON

Sz ACADEMIC APPOINTMENTS of six months or longer and seventy
of shorter duration were conferred upon students and trainees in
the Institution’s programs of higher education in academic year 1969—
1970 (Appendix 6). All such appointments now depend upon prior
acceptance by members of the professional staff. This was the first year
that the recipients of stipend awards had been chosen by committees
of professional staff members, thus assuring that those selected would
fit in well with our efforts in research. ‘These guarantees have in turn
increased staff members’ willingness to supervise student projects. In a
recent survey of more than 300 staff scientists and scholars only 53
indicated that they would not be available to supervise students
(mostly because of administrative duties or plans to spend most of
their time in the field), while 36 indicated that they would prefer only
students who would assist them directly; 82 indicated a desire to su-
pervise one student working on doctoral dissertation research and 78
expressed interest in having more than one. In addition, over 100
indicated a willingness to assist younger graduate students who had
not yet completed their coursework and 83 indicated a willingness to
offer seminars dealing with their research. This represents a very con-
siderable capacity to conduct higher-education programs. While 29
PhDs were earned within the Smithsonian in 1969-1970, the total
could readily be several times that amount. The Institution’s major
objective in higher education is to employ its capacity to the max-
imum practical extent.

In school services a 50 percent increase was achieved in escorted vis-
its for local schoolchildren this year, through the expanded efforts of
our groups of devoted volunteer docents (see Appendix 6). The total of
68,000 pupils is encouraging, but it is far more important to report
that more and more of their experiences are self-directed explorations
of museum exhibits as resources for individual learning. Rather than
attempt to reproduce the classroom experience of listening to a lecture,
we endeavor to help children learn how to learn on their own, enlisting
visual curiosity and the important sense of touch (8 of the 16 tours
offered each day include objects to be passed around). Let our concern
about the limitations of conventional schooling lead us to significant
experiments in the development of learning environments in the con-
genial and fascinating open settings of museums. In January we drew
together a group of educators and museum staff members from around
the country to help identify the most promising contributions of mu-

121
129 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

seums to science education. Its recommendations are being transmitted
to the National Science Foundation, which supported the conference.
With the aid of grants from the Charles F. Kettering Foundation and
The New World Foundation, Professor John Appel of Michigan State
University has conducted a pilot project in the preparation of learning
resource materials from the Smithsonian collections to show the his-
tory of prejudice in America through the portrayal of ethnic and racial
stereotypes in cartooning and the popular arts. The Institution also
agreed to cooperate with the Encyclopaedia Britannica Educational
Corporation in preparing sound filmstrips, an experiment aimed at
extending the museum into the nation’s classrooms.

Perhaps the greatest need in education is to introduce the compre-
hensive insights of modern science and scholarship into the process of
education at all levels. The Smithsonian is endeavoring to conduct
cycles of activities, each to last for a year or so, such as a series of com-
missioned essays to be presented in a major international symposium
and an interdisciplinary exhibit to illuminate and reappraise an area
of knowledge. The fourth cycle will explore cultural factors which may
account for more rapid social change in the modern world. The pro-
gram began with a year-long research seminar on popular culture con-
ducted for faculty members and staff members of organizations in the
Washington area, which was a fascinating exploration of the subject
matter while serving as a welcome opportunity for interchange among
scholars in the metropolitan area.

HE RELATIONSHIP of the Smithsonian Institution’s executive man-

agement staff with its bureau directors and managers of other
organization units may be described as one of partnership directed
toward national goals in the fields of research, education, exhibition,
culture, and public enlightenment. Day-to-day activities in furthering
these objectives result in this partnership interacting in numerous
ways, large and small, with every branch of government; schools and
universities, museums and art galleries; citizens of all ages; professional
societies and organizations; scientists and scholars, artists and authors
the world over; foreign governments and institutions, and the inter-
national public. The program support groups also form a vital segment
of this very diverse, yet closely related, internal and external network.
Significant steps, such as the forming of an internal audits activity in
the Office of the Under Secretary, have been taken during the year to
strengthen and simplify the administrative framework within which
all of these relationships function and thrive.

To enhance the efforts of the support units, some growth has been
realized this year in two areas—the Office of Personnel and Manage-
ment Resources benefitted by the addition of several positions and the
Travel Services Office added one employee. Despite these modest
increases, the support group as a whole has not yet realized position
and funding increases commensurate with the growth of the Smith-
sonian program units. These handicaps did not lessen the lively inter-
est, continuing cooperation, and dedicated efforts of these groups. A
review of their individual and collective accomplishments during the
year reveals that a noteworthy volume of high-standard work has been
performed. The following statement highlights some of their

achievements.

PROGRAM SUPPORT ACTIVITIES

The Office of Personnel and Management Resources has continued
to advise and assist all Smithsonian staff in encouraging the develop-
ment of an atmosphere of individual achievement within a framework
of sound management of human resources. During this year an embry-
onic manpower program was developed, which established manpower

125
126 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

“ceilings” for the organizations within the Institution, and managers
were asked to develop their programs within these ceilings. In this pro-
gram top management is involved increasingly in decisions affecting
human resources management. Manpower adjustments and_ key
employee selections are reviewed by the appropriate Assistant Secre-
tary and recommendations presented to the Secretary for decision.
This procedure has the effect of translating top management interest
throughout the Institution and contributes immeasurably to high-
quality staffing and efficient manpower utilization.

An exciting program called “Vision ’70” was launched this year in
an effort to broaden the horizons of administrators, managers, and
employees. This program began with a series of film presentations
encompassing vital challenges of life in the 70s. One series of four films
about Black America drew an attendance of 600. Other series were pre-
sented on environmental pollution and on drugs in American life. The
goal calls for a monthly series on interrelated presentations, lectures,
discussions, and symposia.

The awards program through which excellence can be rewarded has
been simplified and authority to grant awards was delegated to bureau
directors, eliminating unnecessary committees and additional paper-
work. The career-development and job-enrichment training authority
also has been delegated to bureau directors giving them the ability to
plan their staffs training consistent with program requirements. A
pilot program started in one major bureau in which the authority to
classify jobs was delegated may develop into a prototype leading to
increased flexibility for managers.

The training and development program provided for the attendance
of two major program managers at the Federal Executive Institute, a
voluntary executive management-development film program, a forty-
hour first-level supervisory development program, and a secretarial
training course tailor-made for the Smithsonian. These were in addi-
tion to continuing skills development in on-and-off the job training
provided to employees from the trades and crafts through the profes-
sional ranks.

The varied activities of the Office as evidenced by the following
statistical table of personnel actions, reflects the dynamics of organiza-

tional life of the Smithsonian Institution:
ADMINISTRATIVE MANAGEMENT 127

Meritorious pay increases 178 24 202
Regular pay increases 784 184 968
Total actions 3473 12" 4985,

A special survey showed that this year the office received 452+
visitors, responded to 52,392 telephone calls, and replied to 3240 let-
ters. This total of over 60,000 responses to individuals seeking informa-
tion is in addition to some 5000 internal requests from managers,
supervisors, and employees.

Under the personal leadership of the Secretary, the Smithsonian’s
Office of Equal Employment Opportunity has continued a realistic
program designed to assure genuine equality of opportunity in all
official actions of the Smithsonian Institution.

During the year approximately 110 consultations were conducted
with individual supervisory staff members on matters relating to their
selections of candidates for promotion under the merit promotion pro-
gram. A number of informal complaints were reviewed, factual
information developed, and necessary adjustments made to the satis-
faction of the complainants. Upon request, special counseling services
are provided regularly to employees aspiring to positions of greater
responsibility. This service provides staff members with information
about educational opportunities available in the metropolitan D.C.
area and the methods for acquiring specific educational and experi-
ence requirements for career advancement.

Two special training sessions were conducted for employees assigned
recently to supervisory positions. The discussions stressed the necessity
for eliminating personal prejudices, indifference to the needs of
employees, and favoritism in supervisory practices.

In cooperation with the Office of Personnel and Management
Resources a program is being developed to offer additional career
opportunities for employees in lower-level positions.

The past year was one of progressive change and improvement for
the Buildings Management Department. With the assistance of a pri-
vate management consulting firm, an analysis was made of the Depart-
ment’s program and functional areas and plans were developed to
provide a more manageable and effective operation. Service units were
consolidated into three major groupings: Building Services Division,
Engineering and Construction Division, and Protection Divison. The
128 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

new Epp (electronic data processing)-oriented system was imple-
mented to provide regular, detailed financial and work-progress data
covering virtually all services performed by the Department.

The largest of all Smithsonian units, the Department is responsible
for the operation and maintenance of the physical plant, which com-
prises nearly 3.5 million square feet of floor space; safeguarding the
priceless national collections, and guiding, assisting, and protecting the
millions of people who visit the Smithsonian each year. The very spirit
of these responsibilities results in the Department giving daily support
to the Institution’s diversified research, cultural, educational, and
public enlightenment programs.

The 2560 special events and ceremonies which occurred during the
year, required major participation by the Department. These included
the Folklife Festival and the Tent Theatre productions which were pre-
sented on the Mall. In addition, special efforts were required to cope
with problems associated with various demonstrations held in the
vicinity of Smithsonian Institution buildings.

Major construction and renovation projects, which will total an
expenditure of $16.6 million when completed, required the Depart-
ment’s continuing attention. This included design work, design-review
planning conferences, contract development and review, as well as
contract supervision. Major projects in this category were: the Hirsh-
horn Museum and Sculpture Garden, renovation of the original Smith-
sonian Institution Building, restoration of the exterior of the Arts and
Industries Building, and remodeling of the snack bar in the History
and Technology Building. Innumerable smaller projects were under-
taken throughout the Smithsonian properties, including renovation
and construction of office spaces, modifications to air-handling equip-
ment, installation of a new freight elevator in the Freer, and extensive
design work for other proposed projects.

The Administrative Ssytems Division issued in April the Smithson-
ian Staff Handbook 510—Requisitioning—Purchase of Supplies and
Services. Work started on another handbook in this series, which will
furnish policy and procedural guidelines covering internal services
available to managers and supervisors in support of their programs.
Some 250 administrative issuances were distributed to the staff, rang-
ing from matters of permanent major policy and procedural guidelines
to special interim instructions and matter-of-fact information of a tem-
porary nature. Material about the staffing and functions of the organi-
zations in the Smithsonian was provided to 30 external publications. A
program was developed, in cooperation with the Information Systems
Division, to provide computer support for the preparation and mainte-

nance of data required for the Smithsonian Institution Directory. The
Forms Management Unit processed, through in-house reproduction,
604 requests from 112 organizations for a variety of forms and form
letters to support management, research, education, exhibition, and
public service activities. In addition, 149 orders were placed with the
Government Printing Office and other external sources.

The Photographic Services Division continued its active participa-
tion in programs concerned with research, documentation and con-
servation of collections, exhibitions, education, training, publications,
and public service; and provided essential technical assistance and
guidance as well as training for staff members in other Smithsonian
organizations. Outstanding special exhibits, benefiting from profes-
sional photographic talent, where the “Laser 10,” “Neutra,” “Com-
puter,” and “Frederick Douglass” shows.

The 5870 work requests received by the Division provided 23,734
negatives, 13,734 transparencies, 33,699 microfilm frames, and 103,-
094 prints.

The Travel Services Office continues to experience growth in some
major services, i.e., air and rail reservations booked were up 6 percent;
travel itineraries issued 16 percent, and transportation requests pre-
pared 10 percent, and the dollar value of all transportation purchased
was some $53,000 higher than last year. Formerly cumbersome proce-
dures involved in obtaining travel with excess foreign currencies for
affiliates of the American Institute of Indian Studies have been stream-
lined. Travel management advice, program planning assistance, and a
wide variety of travel services and technical guidance were provided to
support major national and international symposia, meetings, expedi-
tions, and special programs.

Purchases by the Supply Division this year have exceeded 12,000
units, an estimated increase of 1000 over the previous year. Under
the government property distribution and utilization programs, items
from airplanes to missiles—including a seagoing vessel from the Coast
Guard—with an original acquisition value exceeding $8,000,000, have
been obtained for exhibition and research purposes.

CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS

Contract was awarded to the Piracci Construction Company and
actual work was started on 23 March 1970. The projected completion
date of this project is September 1972.

National Zoological Park

Hospital-Research Building. he Lomack Corporation contractors
completed their work in December. The building, now partially occu-
pied, will be completely used when required furnishings are delivered
and installed.

Multiclimate House. Severe modifications in the final design
resulted in the indefinite deferment of this project.

construction started early in fiscal year 1971.

Pollution Abatement Study. Recommended modifications of the
sewerage system were accomplished and some erosion control measures
were implemented at the same time.

Restoration and Renovation of Buildings

Renovation of Smithsonian Institution Building. The Grunley-
Walsh Construction Company continued work throughout the year.
The project was accepted as being substantially completed on 29 June
1970.

Freight Elevator in Freer Gallery. Contracts were let for this project
on 3 March 1970. It is expected that the project will be completed by
the fall of 1970.

J. CARTER Brown, Director

i Fae NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART, although technically established

as a bureau of the Smithsonian Institution, is an autonomous and
separately administered organization. It is governed by its own
Board of Trustees, the statutory members of which are, ex officio, the
Chief Justice of the United States (Chairman), the Secretary of State,
the Secretary of the Treasury, and the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution. There are also five General Trustees, from whom, in fiscal
year 1970, Paul Mellon was reelected President of the Gallery, and
John Hay Whitney, Vice President. The other General Trustees con-
tinuing to serve were Dr. Franklin D. Murphy, Lessing J. Rosenwald,
and Stoddard M. Stevens.

During the fiscal year 1970 the Gallery had 1,935,533 visitors, an
increase of more than 50 percent over the previous year. Its collections
were augmented by an unusually large number of important accessions.
Most notable among these is the Ailsa Mellon Bruce bequest, a collec-
tion which includes Bazille and Camille and The Artist’s Garden at
Vétheuil, both by Monet; and, among twenty two Renoirs, Le Pont
Neuf and Madame Monet and her Son in their Garden at Argenteuil.
Also in the collection is Riverbank by Cézanne, nine paintings by Bon-
nard, five by Pissarro, ten by Vuillard, and the Condesa de Chinchén
by Goya.

The major single acquisition was The Artist’s Father by Cézanne, a
gift of Mr. Paul Mellon. Other important acquisitions include two
Cubist paintings, Football Players by Albert Gleizes and Rush Hour,
New York by Max Weber; The City from Greenwich Village by John
Sloan; and drawings by Andrew Wyeth and van Dyck. Portrait of
Mme. Caillebotte, by Renoir, was bequeathed by Angelika Wertheim
Frink. The Gallery also received two American naive paintings from
Colonel and Mrs. Edgar William Garbisch. Loans were made to 61
institutions in this country and abroad.

Especially notable among the years’s exhibitions at the Gallery were
“German Expressionist Watercolors,’ “Old Master Drawings from
Chatsworth,” “Joseph Wright of Derby,’ “The Artist and Space,”

135
136 SMITHSONIAN YEAR 1970

“Masterpieces of African Sculpture” (attended by 118,801 persons in
five weeks), and “The Reality of Appearance: The Trompe Oeil Tra-
dition in American Painting.”

In February, the Gallery announced a multimedia education pro-
gram for junior and senior high schools throughout the nation, which
will use a new means of reaching students. The program is based on a
low-priced periodical called “Art and Man,” published by Scholastic
Magazines. This is packaged with filmstrips, slides, posters, color
reproductions, and teaching guides. These are drawn from the resources
not only of the National Gallery, but of other museums and private
collections throughout the world.

The Gallery’s extension services have also developed a comprehensive
audio-visual program for use in classrooms. Slide lectures covering the
history of art from the Byzantine period to the 20th century, traveling
exhibits of framed reproductions, and 16-mm motion pictures dealing
with art, humanities, history, social studies, and literature are loaned
to schools at no cost. Last year extension services materials were used
in over 3,000 communities in the nation and reached more than
3,100,000 people.

Total attendance at talks given by the Gallery’s educational staff and
for the programs presented in the auditorium, exclusive of “Civilisa-
tion” films, was 89,951 for 2610 separate tours and events. This repre-
sents an increase in attendance of 2993 over last year, when 2518 pro-
grams were scheduled. Some of the events regularly presented at the
Gallery are its Tours of the Week, Paintings of the Week, and the Sun-
day Auditorium Lectures and Films.

Late last October the American premiere of the thirteen-part series
‘Civilisation,’ narrated by Britian’s distinguished art historian
Kenneth Clark, was presented at the Gallery. Audience response to this
extraordinary series was immediate and enthusiastic. Through gener-
ous public cooperation, funds were raised to purchase prints of the
entire series, making it possible for the series to be shown on a continual
basis. Attendance in the Gallery at the films was over 247,000. In
addition, the Gallery loaned its print, by request, to the White House,
the Department of State, and the Central Intelligence Agency.

That same month saw the broadcast over the National Educational
Television (NET) network of “In Search of Rembrandt,’ which was
made possible by a grant to the National Gallery by Mrs. Cordelia
Scaife May. The hour-long program, produced by the Gallery, was
narrated by James Mason. Net cameras recorded more than 600
Rembrandt paintings and drawings from some 100 museums through-
out the world, some of which are part of the Gallery’s collection. The
NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART ila)

film is now available through the Gallery to schools, libraries, and other
educational institutions.

There were thirty-two guest lecturers who spoke at the Gallery dur-
ing the last fiscal year. They included the A. W. Mellon Lecturer in the
Fine Arts, Sir Nikolaus Pevsner, who gave eight talks on the subject of
“Some Aspects of Nineteenth-Century Architecture.”

Through the new self-service sales facility the Gallery’s publications
fund made available fourteen new publications, as well as eight cata-
logs of those exhibitions shown at the Gallery. During the year over
370,000 customers were served.

Under the supervision of Richard Bales, forty concerts were given
on Sundays in the East Garden Court, twelve of them by the National
Gallery Orchestra. Attendance continued high throughout the season,
usually at capacity for the orchestral programs. All concerts were
broadcast in their entirety by station WGMS, AM-FM.

Scientific research on the causes of deterioration of museum objects,
sponsored in large part by the National Gallery, continues at Carnegie-
Mellon University’s Mellon Institute, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The
fading of pigments and dyes has received major consideration, as well
as the processes of oxidation and ways in which they may be inhibited.
This research project is exploring the application of durable modern
materials to problems in conservation and is concentrated principally
on polymer emulsions, ultraviolet absorbers, and solvents for the
removal of synthetic polymers.

I. M. Pei & Partners moved ahead on the design of the East Building
and connecting link addition to the Gallery. Plans call for over half a
million gross square feet of space devoted to exhibition galleries and
related supporting facilities, such as a Center for Advanced Study in
the Visual Arts, a library, print and drawing facilities, photo archives,
and offices for the Gallery’s administrative and curatorial staff.

John F. Kennedy Center for
the Performing Arts

WiLuiAM McC. BLA, JR., General Director

Boost NIXON BECAME THE FOURTH AMERICAN PRESIDENT to

give tangible support to the John F. Kennedy Center for the Per-
forming Arts when on 17 October 1969 he signed a bill authorizing
additional federal funds for the Center. The authorization increased
the Center’s matching federal grant from $15.5 million to $23 million
and the United States Treasury loan from $15.4 million to $20.4 mil-
lion. Without these additional funds, which were subsequently appro-
priated, construction of the Center could not have been completed on
schedule (P.L. 91-90).

The Center was initiated by President Eisenhower on 2 September
1958 as the National Cultural Center (P.L. 85-874). It received the
strong support of President Kennedy who signed legislation extending
the fund-raising deadline on 19 August 1963 (P.L. 88-100). The Center
was named as the sole official memorial in the nation’s capital to
President Kennedy on 23 January 1964 when President Johnson signed
the John F. Kennedy Center Act (P.L. 88-206). This legislation also
provided the first federal funds for the project.

The Kennedy Center is administered separately by a 45-member
Board of Trustees appointed by the President to ten-year terms, together
with members ex-officio from pertinent public agencies and from the
United States Senate and House of Representatives. Members of the
Board at the end of fiscal 1970 are as follows:

Richard Adler Representative Peter H. B.
Floyd D. Akers Frelinghuysen

Robert O. Anderson Senator J. William Fulbright
Ralph E. Becker Mrs. George A. Garrett

K. LeMoyne Billings Leonard H. Goldenson

On 27 March 1970 President Nixon appointed a 57-member Advi-
sory Committee on the Arts for the Center under the chairmanship of
Mrs. J. Willard Marriott of Washington, D.C. On 26 May the Presi-
dent appointed an additional 49 members to the Advisory Committee,
which is provided for in the John F. Kennedy Center Act.

Members of the Advisory Committee were sworn into office by
Robert H. Finch, Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare and a
Trustee of the Center, on 8 June 1970 preceding their first business
meeting. This committee, which represents 48 states and serves at the
pleasure of the President, will make recommendations to the Board

of Trustees regarding programs presented by the Center and also will
assist the Board in its fund-raising program.

Construction of the Kennedy Center stands 75 percent complete at
the end of fiscal year 1970, compared with 50 percent a year ago. An
average of 600 men are working daily on the structure to assure that
the official opening can take place during the second week of Septem-
ber 1971. Early in March 1970, Ambassador Egidio Ortona of Italy
witnessed the placing of the final piece of Carrara marble in the
Center’s exterior wall which closed in the building. The Center’s entire
requirement for marble, about 3500 tons, is an official gift of the
people of Italy.

Progress payments for construction in place and materials furnished
reached $50.1 million of which $41.8 million were federal funds in-
cluding $20.4 million of repayable bonds. Six additional subcontracts
totaling $1.6 million were awarded during the year bringing to thirty-
eight the number of separate competitive awards made since construc-
tion began in 1965. The awards total nearly $36 million.

The subcontracts awarded during the year are as follows:

Auditorium seating: American Seating Company of Palisades Park, New Jersey;
$434,885.

Ceramic tile and terrazzo: Peter Bratti Associates, Inc. of New York, New York;
$395,300.

Plumbing enclosures and partitions: Global Steel Products Corporation of Deer
Park, Long Island, New York; $57,000.

Painting and finishing and wall coating: Clifton D. Mayhew, Inc. of Arlington,
Virginia; $516,000.

Wood flooring: Couglin-Berk, Inc. of New York, New York; $162,380.

Drapery, curtain, and heavy-duty track: Washington Shade and Awning Co. of
Washington, D.C.; $11,980.

The Secretary of State of Canada, the Honorable Gerard Pelletier,
announced his government’s gift to the Kennedy Center on 16 April
1970 during a brief ceremony at the Center’s construction site. The
gift, the ninth from a foreign nation, is a woolen stage curtain for the
Eisenhower Theater designed by Madame Mariette Rosseau-Vermette,
designer of the curtain for the Opera of the National Arts Centre
in Ottawa. In addition to the nine nations which have already pre-
sented gifts to the Kennedy Center, there are more than twenty coun-
tries that have offered gifts, and discussions with them are continuing.

Looking forward to one kind of education program that will be
presented by the Kennedy Center after its opening, the Center pre-
sented both the second American College Theater Festival and the
National College Jazz Festival in the spring of 1970. The theater
festival, presented with the Smithsonian and sponsored by American

Airlines, brought ten of the nation’s best college theater companies to
perform at I’ord’s Theatre and the new George Washington Univer-
sity Center Theater between 27 April and 12 May. The jazz festival
presented finalists from six regional college jazz festivals at the Kran-
nert Center for the Performing Arts at the University of Illinois in
Champaign-Urbana on 16 and 17 May.

John LaMontaine, the American composer, was commissioned to
write a work for orchestra and organ for the opening season of the
Center and first performance on the organ in the Concert Hall, it was
announced on 28 January 1970. The work was commissioned by Mrs.
Jouett Shouse, a Trustee of the Center and the donor of the Concert
Hall’s Aeolian Skinner organ. The theme for Mr. LaMontaine’s com-
position will be taken from the books of Henry Thoreau, Winter,
Spring, Summer, and Autumn.

On 18 June 1970 the Center sponsored “An Evening with Edward
Villella” at Lisner Auditorium which presented Edward Villella,
Patricia McBride, Violette Verdy, and ten other dancers from the
New York City Ballet. About 150 tickets were made available to
students at one dollar through the sale of benefit tickets.
JOHN F. KENNEDY CENTER FOR THE PERFORMING ARTS 145

With the substantial progress of interior construction work during
fiscal year 1970, tours of the building were arranged on a limited
basis. In September 1969 all major contributors to the Center in the
Washington area were invited to see the building. Subsequently dur-
ing the year many foreign ambassadors to the United States, the cul-
tural attaches of all foreign embassies, members of the press, the D.C.
Arts Council, representatives of the National Endowment on the Arts
and the United States Information Agency, and other groups with a
special interest in the building were invited for a tour.

The Friends of the Kennedy Center, established as an auxiliary
organization by the Trustees in 1966, have about 3000 members in
48 states and 29 regional and state chairmen. ‘The Friends are seeking
to expand membership both in the Washington area and across the
country and welcome all new members.

On 2 June the National Council of the Friends met to elect the
following officers:

Mrs. Polk Guest, chairman

Mrs. Norris Dodson, Jr., vice chairman

Mrs. Eugene Carusi, secretary

Mr. Henry Strong, treasurer

During July and August 1969, the Friends sponsored a city-wide
arts project under the title, “Music, Music, Music” for which 1000
children produced works of art in conjunction with music experiences.
All participants were invited to the construction site on 9 August
for a picnic and to view an exhibit of their works using the River
Terrace covered parkway to form a giant exhibition center.

On 18 December 1969 the Friends produced a unique evening en-
titled “The Kennedy Center is for everyone.” The occasion was the
premiere of the film “Hello, Dolly!,” sponsored by the Kennedy Cen-
ter, and included a box supper at the National Museum of Natural
History. Tickets sold at prices from $1 (limited to students contacted
through city programs) to $50, and by selling a large number of
tickets at the higher prices the Friends were able to make available
over 350 tickets to young people.

The Friends continued to sponsor a weekly radio program on the
performing arts on station wcms, manned the Information Center at
the construction site, and maintained a Speakers Bureau whose mem-
bers gave talks both in Washington and throughout the country. The
Fourth Annual Meeting of the Friends, held 12 and 13 May, featured
Senator Claiborne Pell of Rhode Island as key speaker.
