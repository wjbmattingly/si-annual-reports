Report of the Secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution

S. DILLON RIPLEY
For the Year Ended June 30, 1964

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GentTLEMEN : I have the honor to submit a report showing the activi-
ties and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and its branches for
the fiscal year ended June 30, 1964.

GENERAL STATEMENT

This past year, on January 31, marked the retirement of my prede-
cessor, Dr. Leonard Carmichael, seventh Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution. In the Annual Report for 1963 there was presented a
general review of the activities of the Institution from 1953 to 1963,
which gives some impression of the magnitude of the changes and
developments instituted under Dr. Carmichael’s regime. This splen-
did administrator, who has done so much for the Smithsonian, deserves
the very highest praise. Recognition of his accomplishments has been
widely expressed, in honorary degrees conferred upon him and in
decorations by foreign governments. The Institution will always be
grateful to its seventh Secretary and proud of the record of progress
and achievement that he helped to foster. Not the least have been the
confidence and esteem which he developed with the Regents of the
Institution, who have constantly supported and encouraged the
programs of the Institution. The Smithsonian wishes Dr. Carmichael
well in his new career as vice president for research of the National
Geographic Society .

The Smithsonian and Higher Education

In the few months since the assumption of the post of Secretary
by the present incumbent on February 1, 1964, certain proposals have
been inaugurated with the support of the Regents. The general
problem of the Smithsonian’s role in cooperating with universities

1
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

and programs of higher learning has been explored. Such a program
represents a continuation of the traditional role of the Institution
in the educational field, although perhaps historically it received
greater emphasis in the early days of the Smithsonian than it has
in recent decades. The Smithsonian’s first Secretary, Joseph Henry,
said many years ago: “The Smithsonian, with its widening responsi-
bilities among the arts as well as the sciences, must continue and
expand its leadership in education and scholarship in America.”
It seems high time that we should develop this role, for there is urgent
need for the Smithsonian to render genuine service and leadership.

In the broad areas of biology and anthropology, support for special-
ized training not otherwise available under existing university pro-
grams must and can be given by the Smithsonian. In addition to
general programs in specialized fields, specific programs are currently
being undertaken with eight universities. Duke University will coop-
erate with the Smithsonian Institution in training biological oceanog-
raphers. Johns Hopkins University will join in a common venture
to offer graduate education opportunities in paleontology. Other
programs of cooperative education have been developed with the
University of Minnesota in algology, the University of Maryland in
ornithology, George Washington University in malacology, and the
University of Kansas in paleontology. In addition there is the well-
known program of the Freer Gallery of Art and the University of
Michigan in Oriental art and the Astrophysical Observatory’s inte-
grated activities with Harvard. Through such arrangements grad-
uate students may come to the Smithsonian Institution to carry out
research projects under the supervision of staff members who may
be given recognition in the form of an honorary or part-time appoint-
ment to the university faculty. Improved use of museum and other
laboratory facilities in this way will help to overcome severe national
shortages of natural-science specialists in a number of fields.

As part not only of its service to the cause of higher education in
this country but also in order to replicate specialists in careers of
research and study associated with museum programs, the Institution
must always stand ready to serve as a catalyst, to create opportunities
for research for students and staff, and to foster interchange between
scholars both here and abroad.

Cooperation with Museums

As a part of this wider usefulness of the Smithsonian to education,
we hope that it may be possible to broaden the Smithsonian’s tradi-
tional cooperation with museums throughout the world. Museums
and their related laboratories are just entering a new era, and museum
resources are being drawn upon as never before for general education.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 3

Thirty years ago a mere 15 percent of museums in America were con-
nected with education in some form. This marked a drastic decline
from a hundred years ago when museums housed the genesis of scien-
tific research in the Western World. Today over 90 percent are
involved, ranging from simple school-extension programs to post-
graduate fellowships. It is for these reasons that we feel that the
Smithsonian, with its superb museum resources, now has a great
opportunity to serve the museum world in a role of leadership and
cooperation. As a first step in this effort, the Smithsonian Institu-
tion has entered into an agreement with the American Association
of Museums to promote a joint publications program to facilitate
the publication and distribution of works needed in the broad field of
museum administration, education, museum services, and the science
of museology.

Emphasis on Research

Research on wild populations and undisturbed conditions in nature
has taken on an aspect of urgency in recent years because so many
opportunities for study have changed or disappeared. But man’s need
to understand his environment and use it sympathetically will require
a broad program of observation and research, especially in the tropics.
The Smithsonian Institution will seek to promote interest in these
objectives throughout the public and private scientific community.
Beginning in April, Philip C. Ritterbush was appointed Special
Assistant to the Secretary for Scientific Matters, to explore prospects
for cooperation with other Government agencies in this effort and to
promote consideration of these objectives in the development of
national science policy.

A related objective is to strengthen the position, within science as a
whole, of those fields of biology which have the entire organism as their
object: ecology, genetics, systematics, botany, zoology, oceanography,
microbiology, and paleontology, as well as the sciences of man which
have so long been central concerns of the Smithsonian. Two related
approaches to this subject have been begun. With hopes of contrib-
uting to the efficiency of research and investigation, studies are under-
way to promote the application of data processing, technician employ-
ment and training, improved cataloging methods, and more rapid
means of indexing and retrieving information in the biological
sciences. In order to overcome shortages of competent investigators,
studies have begun to indicate appropriate means of expanding educa-
tional opportunity in neglected areas of the natural sciences.

International Activities

During the period under review, the Institution made a determined
effort to carry its international activities beyond traditional overseas
field expeditions and research, which primarily benefit the Smithso-
nian, to cooperation with other Government agencies and private insti-
tutions in the development of exchange of persons and international
exhibits programs, to the benefit of others.

Beginning in March, William W. Warner was engaged as a Con-
sultant to the Secretary for International Activities to explore appro-
priate areas of international cooperation. The first of these has been
in the field of archeology with the Department of State. The Depart-
ment’s Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs has expressed a
strong interest in having the Smithsonian exercise a leading role in
the administration of overseas archeological research or excavation
projects in connection with those nations in which excess foreign cur-
rencies are available through agricultural surplus sales under Public
Law 480. The Bureau has also welcomed the Institution’s offer to
help with the selection and programing of foreign scholarship candi-
dates in fields of Smithsonian interest.

The Institution has also assisted the Department’s Office of Soviet
and Eastern European Exchanges in planning exchange of museum
professionals and exhibits, in accordance with the new U.S.-U.S.S.R.
Exchange Agreement, which for the first time includes specific men-
tion of museums. The Secretary of the Smithsonian serves as chair-
man of the American Association of Museums’ Soviet Exchange Com-
mittee, an advisory group that has helped the Department in the choice
of museum professionals and possible exhibits going to and coming
from Russia.

In addition, the Smithsonian has offered its storage facilities and
staff assistance to the Department’s “Art for Embassies,” a project
aimed at providing United States Embassies with representative
American works of art. The first paintings lent under this project
were turned over to the Smithsonian for safekeeping in June.

Among international organizations, the Smithsonian has supported
the concept of American participation in the UNESCO campaign for
the preservation of the monuments of Nubia in the upper Nile Valley.
The Secretary has assisted the State Department in its request for
a foreign currency appropriation to provide for American participa-
tion by explaining the significance of the monuments themselves and
the interests of American universities and museums in the Nubian
campaign in particular, and in the wider problems of classical archeol-
ogy in the Near East in general.

During May the Organization of American States’ Department
of Scientific Affairs agreed to announce and fund, through its estab-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 5

lished fellowship program, opportunities for Latin American students
to serve as aides in research projects conducted at the Canal Zone
Biological Area. Discussions have also been held on a jointly financed
Organization of American States-Smithsonian program to provide
postdoctoral research grants for Latin American scholars in environ-
mental and descriptive biology tenable at both Barro Colorado in the
Canal Zone and the Museum of Natural History.

The Institution has also discovered considerable interest among
major American private foundations for cooperative programs in
relatively neglected areas of basic science in the developing countries.
The development of these and similar activities in future years can
help fulfill the Institution’s basic responsibility for the advancement
of science and the humanities among all peoples.

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in 1846,
in accordance with the terms of the will of James Smithson, of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smithsonian
Institution, and establishment for the increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting the trust,
Congress determined that the Federal Government was without
authority to administer the trust directly, and, therefore, constituted
an “establishment,” whose statutory members are “the President, the
Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the executive
departments.”

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The Institution suffered a great loss this year in the death of Repre-
sentative Clarence Cannon on May 12, 1964, the day before the spring
meeting of the Board. Mr. Cannon had served as a Regent for nearly
30 years, longer than any other member of the Board. His wise
counsel and unselfish devotion to the affairs of the Smithsonian will be
sadly missed. On May 19 Representative George H. Mahon of Texas
was appointed by the Speaker of the House of Representatives to fill
this vacancy.

The roll of Regents at the close of the fiscal year was as follows:
Chief Justice of the United States Earl Warren, Chancellor; members
from the Senate: Clinton P. Anderson, J. William Fulbright, Leverett
Saltonstall; members from the House of Representatives: Frank T.
Bow, Michael J. Kirwan, George H. Mahon; citizen members: John
Nicholas Brown, William A. M. Burden, Robert V. Fleming, Crawford
H. Greenewalt, Caryl P. Haskins, Jerome C. Hunsaker.

On January 23, 1964, the annual meeting of the Board was held in
the Regents’ Room preceded by a private ceremony of installation of
6 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

the new Secretary. Dr. Leonard Carmichael, Secretary, presented
his published annual report on the activities of the Institution. The
Chairman of the Executive and Permanent Committees of the Board,
Dr. Robert V. Fleming, gave the financial report for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1963.

On the evening preceding the annual meeting a formal dinner was
held in the Hall of Graphic Arts of the Museum of History and Tech-
nology to celebrate the dedication of this new museum. ‘The members
of the Board and their wives as well as others directly concerned with
the planning and construction of the new building were guests.

The spring meeting of the Board of Regents was held on May 13
in the Museum of History and Technology. The Chairman of the
Executive Committee presented a financial report.

FINANCES

A statement of finances, dealing particularly with Smithsonian
private funds, will be found in the report of the Executive Committee
of the Board of Regents, page 274.

Funds appropriated to the Institution for its regular operations
for the fiscal year ended June 30, 1964, totaled $13,191,000 and were
obligated as follows:

Besides this direct appropriation, the Institution received funds
by transfer from other Government agencies as follows: from the Dis-
trict of Columbia for the National Zoological Park, $1,597,356; from
the National Park Service, Department of the Interior, for the River
Basin Surveys, $254,500.

VISITORS

Visitors to the six Smithsonian buildings on the Mall again this
year surpassed all records, with a total of 10,813,195, which was 503,359
more than for the preceding year. June 1964, with 1,592,540, was
SECRETARY'S REPORT 7

the month of largest attendance; April 1964 second, with 1,555,295;
and July 1963 third, with 1,407,858. The largest attendance recorded
for a single day was 104,285 on March 28, 1964. Table 1 gives a sum-
mary of the attendance records for the six buildings. The National
Zoological Park had an estimated 3,900,000 visitors during the year.
When this figure is added to the attendance in the Institution’s build-
ings on the Mall, and to the 1,236,155 recorded at the National Gallery
of Art, the total Smithsonian attendance for fiscal 1964 aggregated
15,949,350.
SMITHSON BICENTENNIAL

The year 1965 marks the two-hundredth anniversary of the birth of
James Smithson, founder of the Smithsonian Institution, and plans
are in progress to observe this event in a manner that will draw interna-
tional attention to Smithson and the work of the establishment he
founded. A committee of Smithsonian staff members has been named,
under the chairmanship of John C. Ewers, to plan the celebration and
make recommendations to the Secretary concerning it. Scheduled for
the fall of 1965, it is the intention to plan a program that will attract
scholars and representatives of scholarly institutions and governments,
from all parts of the world.

JOSEPH HENRY PAPERS

In collaboration with the National Publications Commission, the
National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical
Society, a project has been initiated to collect, edit, and publish the
Papers of Joseph Henry, first Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. For at least a decade, scholars devoted to general American his-
tory as well as to the history of science in America have felt that such
a documentary work would provide not only the story of this outstand-
ing scientist but also much of the history of the organization of science
in the United States, its relations with government, and its links with
science and scientists in Europe. ‘The significance of Henry was
underlined in 1954 when the National Historical Publications Com-
mission named him as one of the nonpolitical Americans whose papers
are most worthy of publication.

Because of the enormity of the task and the high costs involved, it is
impossible to say at this time how rapidly this project will move for-
ward. Formation of a permanent committee to organize and direct the
project is planned.

OPENING OF MUSEUM OF HISTORY AND TECHNOLOGY

On the evening of January 22, 1964, with a large and distinguished
audience in attendance, dedication ceremonies were held for the formal
opening of the new Museum of History and Technology. The pro-
gram included music by the United States Marine Band, introductory
remarks by Dr. Leonard Carmichael, Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, who presided as master of ceremonies, and addresses by
the Chancellor of the Smithsonian, the Honorable Earl Warren, Chief
Justice of the United States; by the Honorable Clinton P. Anderson,
United States Senator from New Mexico, Regent of the Smithsonian,
and chairman of the Joint Congressional Committee on Construction
of a Building for a Museum of History and Technology for the Smith-
sonian Institution; and by the President of the United States, Lyndon
B. Johnson. The texts of these addresses were later printed in
a brochure (Smithsonian Publication 4531) distributed by the
Institution.

The history of the development and construction of this splendid
new museum of the Smithsonian on Washington’s Mall has been told
in previous reports. Suffice it here to say that in many ways it has
exceeded expectations in its acceptance and use by the public. From
the day of opening until June 30, a period of 22 weeks, a total of more
than 2,500,000 visitors entered its doors. At the time of opening about
one-fifth of the total exhibition area of the building—50 halls—were
ready for viewing.

LANGLEY MEDAL PRESENTATION

The Langley Medal of the Smithsonian Institution was awarded
on May 5 to Astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr., in recognition of his
“courageous and pioneering contributions to scientific research as the
first American to fly in space and the first to control the attitude of a
spacecraft while in flight and during a condition of weightlessness.”
Presentation, which coincided with the third anniversary of Shepard’s
historic flight, was made by Chief Justice Earl Warren, Chancellor of
the Smithsonian, at a brief ceremony at the Institution. In attend-
ance were members of the Smithsonian Board of Regents, including
Senator Clinton P. Anderson, who made a brief address; officials of
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration; Smithsonian
officials; and members of Commander Shepard’s family. This was
the eleventh time the Smithsonian Institution had awarded the Lang-
ley Medal in the 56 years since its establishment in 1908.
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964
LECTURES

Elmer A. Sperry, Jr., eminent inventor, delivered the fifth Lester D.
Gardner lecture, “Early Airplane Instruments,” in the auditorium of
the Freer Gallery of Art on the evening of September 27.

Dr. James A. Van Allen, professor of physics, University of Iowa,
gave the 29th Annual James Arthur Lecture on the Sun on the evening
of December 12, 1963, in the auditorium of the Natural History Build-
ing. His subject was “Some General Aspects of the Earth’s Radiation
Belts.”

Ben Norris, painter and professor of art, University of Hawaii,
delivered an illustrated lecture, “Images from Hawaii—F rom Captain
Cook to Contemporary Crossroads,” on January 20, 1964, in the audi-
torium of the Natural History Building. This lecture was sponsored
by the Hawaii State Society of Washington, D.C.

George Bass, special assistant for underwater archeology, Univer-
sity of Pennsylvania University Museum, lectured on “Diving 3,000
Years into the Past” in the auditorium of the Natural History Build-
ing on the evening of January 24, 1964. This illustrated lecture was
sponsored jointly by the Smithsonian Institution and the Archaeo-
logical Institute of America.

The Honorable Desmond Guinness, president of the Irish Georgian
Society, gave an illustrated lecture on “18th Century Georgian Archi-
tecture in Ireland” in the auditorium of the Natural History Building
on the evening of February 8, 1964.

The first Edwin A. Link Lecture, “Training by Simulation,” was
delivered by Astronaut Alan B. Shepard, Jr., in the auditorium of the
Natural History Building on the evening of February 19, 1964. This
series of lectures, made possible by a grant from the Link Foundation,
is administered by the Smithsonian Institution in cooperation with
the U.S. Office of Education.

Miss Sylvia Kenney, associate professor of music at Bryn Mawr
College and visiting associate professor of music at Yale University,
gave a lecture on the subject “Paintings, Chronicles, and Stylistic
Criteria as Guides for the Performance of 15th Century Music” in
the auditorium of the Natural History Building on the evening of
May 22, 1964.

Several lectures sponsored by the Freer Gallery of Art and the
National Gallery of Art are listed in the reports of these bureaus.

THE KENNEDY CENTER

In January the National Cultural Center, a bureau of the Smith-
sonian Institution, by act of Congress was renamed the John F. Ken-
nedy Center for the Performing Arts as a memorial to our late Presi-
dent. By this same act, appropriation of $15.5 million was authorized
SECRETARY'S REPORT iW |

from Federal funds to match contributions from the public. Under
the chairmanship of Roger L. Stevens, the Center made notable prog-
ress during the year toward its objectives. Many substantial gifts
were received. Questions relating to the size and site of the Center
have been resolved, and plans call for construction of the substructure
to begin in the summer of 1965. It is estimated that about 214 years
will be required to complete the building. The Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution serves ex officio as a member of the board of trustees
of the Center. Also serving on the board are Senator Leverett Salton-
stall and Senator J. William Fullbright, both Regents of the Institu-
tion. A detailed report on the John F. Kennedy Center for the year,
together with a financial statement, is presented beginning on page 247.

NATIONAL ARMED FORCES MUSEUM ADVISORY BOARD

During the year the National Armed Forces Museum Advisory
Board gained a staff to provide assistance in the execution of its mis-
sions as assigned by Public Law 87-186. The staff head, designated
Coordinator of Studies, is Col. John H. Magruder, III, U.S. Marine
Corps. Colonel Magruder, Director, Marine Corps Museums, was
detailed by the Secretary of the Navy to work part-time with the
Board. He reported for duty October 2, 1963. Other staff members
are James S. Hutchins, Assistant Coordinator of Studies (reported
December 2, 1963) ; Col. Robert M. Calland, U.S. Marine Corps, Re-
tired, Museum Specialist (reported June 1, 1964) ; and Mrs. Miriam
H. Schuman, Administrative Assistant (reported September 23, 1963).

The Board, at its third meeting, January 20, 1964, unanimously
endorsed Fort Washington, Md., now administered by the National
Park Service, as the most feasible and appropriate site for the pro-
posed National Armed Forces Museum. The Board also recommended
to the Smithsonian Board of Regents that necessary arrangements
be made with the National Park Service and the Congress to provide
for the transfer of that site to the Smithsonian Institution.

Accordingly, representatives of the Smithsonian Institution opened
negotiations with the National Park Service looking to acquisition of
Fort Washington. On March 16, 1964, the Secretary met with T. Sut-
ton Jett, Director of the National Capital Region, National Park
Service, and discussed with him the Board’s interest in obtaining the
Fort Washington site. On May 14, 1964, the subject again was dis-
cussed at a meeting between the Secretary and George B. Hartzog,
Director of the National Park Service. Further negotiations with
the Park Service are in progress.

During the year the staff of the National Armed Forces Museum
Advisory Board opened negotiations with various agencies of the
Armed Forces and the General Services Administration in regard to
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

the retention and eventual transfer to the Smithsonian Institution of
military and naval objects appropriate for the collections of the
National Armed Forces Museum. In addition, the staff undertook its
own thorough search for such objects at military and naval installa-
tions throughout the continental United States. The staff, in coopera-
tion with the Smithsonian Library, also initiated steps to acquire from
Armed Forces historical agencies and elsewhere significant publica-
tions in the fields of military and naval history, to serve as a nucleus
of the study center library of the proposed museum. All govern-
mental agencies are cooperating fully with the work of the Board.
Once a site for the museum has been fixed, there will be no dearth of
materiel around which to establish a museum exhibit plan.

SCIENCE INFORMATION EXCHANGE

The Science Information Exchange (S.I.E.) receives, organizes,
and disseminates information about scientific research in progress.
Its mission is to assist the planning and management of research activi-
ties supported by Government and non-Government agencies and insti-
tutions by promoting the exchange of information that concerns sub-
ject matter, distribution, level of effort, and other data pertaining to
current research in the prepublication stage. It helps program direc-
tors and administrators to avoid unwarranted duplication and to deter-
mine the most advantageous distribution of research funds. It serves
the entire scientific community by informing individual investigators
about who is currently working on problems in their special fields.

The Exchange is concerned only with research actually in progress
in order to cover the 1- to 3-year information gap between the time a
research project 1s proposed or started and the time the results become
generally available in published form. Thus, the Exchange comple-
ments, rather than duplicates, the services of technical libraries and
established documentation centers.

Information is received by the Exchange from all available sources,
specifying who supports a research task, who does it, where it is being
done, and a 200-word technical summary of what is being done. These
basic data are cast into a one-page record, the Notice of Research
Project (N.R.P.) that serves as the major input and output of the
Exchange. ‘These records are analyzed, indexed, processed, and stored
in computer and manual files in such a way that a wide variety of
questions about any of these items or any combination of items can be
quickly retrieved or compiled.

The acquisition of task records and the input workloads have con-
tinued to climb rapidly, from about 56,000 in fiscal year 1962 to
75,000 in 1963 and over 100,000 in 1964. The output services rendered
to United States Government agencies and for the entire scientific
SECRETARY'S REPORT 13

community have also increased rapidly, from about 27,000 reports of all
kinds in 1963 to about 84,000 this fiscal year, Over three-quarters of
a million research task records (N.R.P.’s) were requested and dis-
patched during the year.

With the rapidly increasing demands, the total staff, including about
40 scientists, grew to 155, but in recent months it has dropped slightly,
reflecting in part the economies resulting from improved organization
and systems control.

To handle this rapidly increasing volume of records more efficiently
and economically, the reorganization and expansion of the Exchange
were completed during the past year. An entirely new assembly line
system now is capable of receiving and processing well over 100,000
records per year. The system is easily controlled and is amenable to
expansion or contraction as workloads may dictate. Each unit process,
each organizational unit, and each of the different kinds of services
rendered can be identified and the unit costs can be determined by a
new accounting system developed and put into operation in recent
months.

For almost 15 years, the Exchange was supported by a number of
Federal agencies whose far-sighted research directors and administra-
tors were aware of the fact that the management of multimillion-dollar
research programs might well be facilitated by the prompt exchange
of information about on-going programs. As this enterprise grew
rapidly in recent years, support and management problems became
more complex and difficult for individual agencies, and so, in 1964,
the National Science Foundation undertook the responsibility for
funding and overall management with continued operational responsi-
bility under the aegis of the Smithsonian Institution.

It is axiomatic that maximum use should be made of the large
number of research records acquired, processed, and stored by the Ex-
change. To this end, S.I.E. has endeavored to make these services
known and available to all eligible users. During the past year, five
articles were published in professional journals by staff members de-
scribing S.I.E. and its services. Twenty-three articles and news notes
about S.I.E. were published by others. Over 25,000 descriptive
brochures were requested and distributed. About 685 visitors, includ-
ing a number from overseas, called at the Exchange to find out how
these stores of information could be adapted to their own scientific
information and research management problems. S.I.E. staff pre-
sented 26 talks, papers, and briefings to professional scientific societies,
groups, and organization units. All these activities indicate a growing
interest in S.I.E. throughout the scientific community, and there is
good reason to believe that these activities are the most effective
ways of increasing the use of S.I.E. and thereby contributing to effec-
tive management of research projects and programs.
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

By the end of this year all Federal agencies with significant research
programs were participating in some degree in the S.I.E. program.
About 90-95 percent of all Government research in life sciences and
social sciences is being registered. In general, the physical sciences
collection has grown slowly, but some fields now are approaching fairly
comprehensive proportions. An estimated 15,000 to 20,000 records
dealing mostly with applied research in physical sciences are still to be
registered. Interest among non-Government agencies, universities,
foundations, national fund-raising agencies, industry, State and city
research agencies, has been growing substantially even though S.1.E.
has concentrated its efforts in the past on Federal agency participa-
tion. Closer cooperation with non-Government agencies may be antic-
ipated as the Federal collections approach comprehensive proportions.

To determine if S.I.E. does, in fact, fulfill its mission and effectively
achieve its objectives, a questionnaire was sent to 600 scientists who
have used the Exchange services. From their response, it was evident
that over 95 percent received information concerning new research
they did not know about, even in their own specialty fields. The
majority used the information to keep up with latest developments and
to avoid duplication in formulating new projects and research pro-
posals. Over 70 percent affirmed good scientific quality, comprehen-
sive coverage, and no irrelevant material. Over 60 percent indicated
their interest and endorsement by volunteering comments and sug-
gestions. Although the purpose of the questionnaire was primarily
as guidance for §.I.E., this practical field test of an actual operating
system and its products seems to offer objective and concrete
evidence that this kind of information service on current research is
needed and is acceptable to the research scientists for whom it was
designed.

SMITHSONIAN MUSEUM SERVICE

The Smithsonian Museum Service, through appropriate educational
media, interprets to museum visitors and to the general public the
objects, specimens, and exhibits in the several Smithsonian museums
and develops interpretative and educational programs relating to the
work of the Institution in the fields of science, history, and art. The
Museum Service also cooperates with the volunteers of the Junior
League of Washington, D.C., who conduct the Junior League Guided
Tour Program at the Smithsonian. A more complete report of this
activity, directed by G. Carroll Lindsay, curator, with the assistance
of Mrs. Nella Lloyd, visitor services assistant, is carried in the report
on the U.S. National Museum (pp. 65-66).

In addition, the Museum Service acts to coordinate special events
and ceremonial activities involving the Smithsonian museums and out-
side organizations.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 15

The Museum Service provided assistance to professional groups and
individuals visiting the museums of the Institution or planning to do
so. Assistance in the form of lectures, answers to inquiries, and
specal tours of museum areas was rendered to college and university
groups and individuals from the United States and abroad. Mr.
Lindsay served as consultant on museum organization and practices to
representatives from other museums on several occasions.

The Audioguide, or radio lecture system, in the Museum of Natural
History continued in operation and was used by 39,504 persons. The
complete text of the 37 Audioguide lectures was published during the
year under the title Zhe E'xhibits Speak. In the Museum of History
and Technology tape-recorded lectures describing the exhibits were
made available to visitors to the First Ladies Hall. This system, using
self-contained, battery-powered tape playback machines, is known as
Acoustiguide.

Assistant curator Mrs. Sophy Burnham wrote, produced, and
directed a 27-minute, 16-millimeter, color motion picture, The Leaf
Thieves. The film shows research activities, field work, and exhibition
preparation carried on by the Museum of Natural History, and in-
cluded footage exposed in British Guiana during the 1962 Smithsonian
Botany-Exhibits Expedition to that area. It is designed to acquaint
students with the opportunities for scientific or technical careers in
natural history museums.

The film The Smithsonian’s Whale, describing the construction of
the 92-foot model of a blue whale on exhibit in the Museum of Natural
History, was distributed from 10 points across the United States and
was shown on television stations in Washington and New York.
Prints of this film also were borrowed directly from the Museum
Service. This film was selected from films produced by Government
agencies for showing at the Venice Film Festival in Venice, Italy.

The staff docent in zoology, Mrs. Linda Gordon, and the staff docent
in anthropology, Mrs. Marjorie Halpin, continued to handle non-
technical correspondence from the public on their respective sub-
jects; they provided tours for groups visiting the museum; lectured
before classes visiting the museum; and prepared information leaflets
on exhibition halls, bibliographies, and similar educational materials.

Special “touch” tours for several groups of blind persons were ar-
ranged during the year. Specimens and objects from the reference
collections as well as selected portions of the public exhibits were
included in the programs arranged for the blind.

The Urban Service Corps program, under the general direction of
Mrs. William Wirtz, held seven sessions at the Smithsonian. Empha-
sis was placed on the work of the Musuem of Natural History, and the
programs, designed to stimulate student participation, included lec-
tures and tours of its exhibit areas and technical laboratories. At the
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

conclusion of one of the regularly scheduled Urban Service Corps
programs, a special session was devoted to the Museum of History and
Technology (at that time not yet open to the public). Scientific and
administrative staff members of the Institution also participated in
these programs.

Miss Mary Ann Friend continued her work as audiovisual librarian,
cataloging slides and arranging for the loan of slides, films, and
photographs related to Smithsonian exhibits and research activities.
Facilities of this library were extensively used by Smithsonian staff
members and by borrowers outside the Institution.

During the year the responsibility for operating the museum sales
shops was transferred to the Museum Service, and Mrs. Emily Pettinos,
formerly with the University Museum, University of Pennsylvania,
joined the staff as manager of the sales operations. The shops serve as
an adjunct to the educational program of the Institution, making avail-
able to the visitors printed materials relating to the work of the In-
stitution and reproductions of materials in the museum collections.
Three shops are operated in the Museum of History and Technology
and one each in the Museum of Natural History and the Arts and In-
dustries Building.

Arrangements were made by the Museum Service for various Smith-
sonian public functions and special events, including the opening of
new exhibit halls, temporary exhibitions, film showings, lectures, visita-
tions by heads of state and other distinguished visitors, and the open-
ing of the Museum of History and Technology. More complete
information about these activities will be found under appropriate
headings elsewhere in this report. Current mailing lists for announce-
ments of these events were maintained.

The Smithsonian Calendar of Events, a listing of special events held
at the Institution, was prepared and distributed monthly. An illus-
trated directory to museums in the Washington metropolitan area was
prepared by the Museum Service and published by the Institution,
under the title Brief Guide to the Museums in the Washington Area.

The Museum Service continued to assist radio and television pro-
ducers wishing to feature Smithsonian exhibits and scientific work in
local or network programs. In this regard the Museum Service acts
as liaison between the broadcaster’s representatives and the various
operating units of the Institution.

William C. Grayson, formerly with the National Broadcasting Co.,
joined the staff as consultant to assist in the preparation of plans for
more effective Smithsonian participation in various aspects of tele-
vision and radio activity, including the use of the television studio in
the Museum of History and Technology.

Meredith Johnson, formerly director of Woodlawn Plantation,
joined the staff of the Museum Service to assist in the development of
SECRETARY’S REPORT 7

educational and visitor service programs, particularly in regard to the
greatly increased demands for such services arising upon the opening
of the Museum of History and Technology.

During the year curator G. Carroll Lindsay attended various pro-
fessional meetings and conferences. He appeared on the programs
of the following meetings: The Annual Winterthur Seminar on
Museum Operation and Connoisseurship, Winterthur, Del.; the
Museum Audio-Visual Applications Group, Rochester, N.Y.; the
American Association of Museums Annual Meeting, St. Louis, Mo.
He also attended the annual meetings of the Division of Audio-Visual
Instruction, National Education Association, Rochester, N.Y.; and
the Museum Stores Association, Chicago, Ill.

He also lectured before various groups visiting the Institution, de-
scribing for them the history and current work of the Smithsonian,
and presented similar talks before meetings of local service clubs and
other groups interested in the Institution.

Mr. Lindsay continued his research in the field of early American
culture. He also presented lectures to the St. Mary’s County, Md.,
Historical Society and to the National Trust Conference for Historic
Museum Associates on the subject of southern colonial architecture;
participated in the annual Forum held by the Alexandria (Va.) Asso-
ciation and spoke on early Alexandria architecture; presented a series
of four lectures on early American furniture as part of the Junior
League of Washington’s adult education program; and lectured
at the Cheltenham Township (Pa.) Adult School on the subject of
early American silver. He appeared four times on television pro-
grams to discuss the work of the Smithsonian Institution and twice
for the same purpose on radio programs.

The curator and the consultant on TV installations, William C.
Grayson, traveled to New York to consult with the program director
of Lincoln Center. They also observed the visitor information facili-
ties in Williamsburg, Va.

The assistant curator attended the Calvin Motion Picture Studio
Workshop seminar on motion-picture production in Kansas City, Mo.

The audiovisual librarian, Miss Mary Ann Friend, represented the
Museum Service at the American Film Festival of the Educational
Film Library Association in New York City for the entry of one of
our films.

The museum docents have made trips to the American Museum of
Natural History to examine the education programs and confer with
staff members. In addition, the docent in zoology traveled to Boston
to examine the education department at the Science Museum. The
docent in zoology attended the International Congress on Zoology
which consisted of seminars and a film theater in action.
Report on the United States
National Museum

Sime: I have the honor to submit the following report on the condi-
tion and operations of the U.S. National Museum for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1964:

COLLECTIONS

During the year, 1,234,752 specimens were added to the national col-
lections and distributed among the 10 departments as follows: An-
thropology, 38,484; zoology, 196,427; botany, 30,427; entomology,
241,947; mineral sciences, 9,186; paleobiology, 376,007; science and
technology, 1,361; arts and manufactures, 2,697 ; civil history, 336,393 ;
and Armed Forces history, 1,823. ‘This year’s accessions were acquired
as gifts from individuals, by staff collecting in the field, or as transfers
from Government departments and agencies. The complete report on
the Museum, published as a separate document, includes a detailed
list of the year’s acquisitions, of which the more important are sum-
marized below. Catalog entries in all departments now total
58,755,099.

Anthropology.—Two large and important North American collec-
tions were accessioned in the division of archeology. One, received
by transfer from the River Basin Surveys, Bureau of American Eth-
nology, included 18,603 specimens from the Medicine Creek Reservoir,
Nebraska, and comprises one of the largest and most complete collec-
tions extant on the prehistoric agricultural peoples of the Central
Plains in the 9th to 14th centuries. The second lot is from the 1931-82
investigations of the Bureau of American Ethnology at Signal Butte,
a key stratified site in western Nebraska with a series of occupational
levels spanning the period from 2600 B.C. to about A.D. 1700. Other
noteworthy accessions include 6,031 pieces collected by the Bureau
of American Ethnology from the Parita and Santa Marta areas in
Panama; a group of handaxes from the Fezan and microlithic blades
from Tripolitania, Libya, presented by James R. Jones of the U.S. AID
mission to Libya; and an exceptionally well-preserved Egyptian
cat mummy donated by Edith Goldsmith of Methuen, Mass.

In the division of ethnology, a large portion of the year’s acquisi-
tions were obtained, chiefly by purchase, for use in the new Hall of
Cultures of Africa and Asia. Noteworthy Asian accessions included:

79 specimens representing Chinese opera, purchased with aid of the
Chinese National Government; 116 items relating to agriculture and
daily life in Japan, obtained from the Japanese Association of Mu-
seums; a Hindu village altar assemblage of 40 specimens, purchased
with assistance of the Government of Orissa, Bhubanaswar, and the
Crafts Museum, New Delhi; 255 Burmese items purchased from the
collector, Brian Peacock, University of Rangoon ; 226 specimens mostly
from Isfahan and dealing with Iran textile printing, collected and
donated by Mrs. Ethel J. W. Bunting; 76 items of Korean furniture,
architectural pieces, and objects of everyday use, presented by the
Korean Ministry of Public Information; 5 traditional Japanese
swords, with scabbards and a leather sword case, presented by Adm.
William M. Fechteler; a ceremonial bone apron from Tibet, by ex-
change from Simon Kriger, Washington, D.C.; and 3 large rubbings
of stone relief from the Bayon at Angkor, donated by the Kingdom
of Cambodia. To the African collections were added 60 items from
the Endo-Marakwet of Kenya, purchased for the Museum by Deric
O’Bryan, formerly U.S. Foreign Service Officer in Nairobi; and full-
scale copies of six rock paintings from the Tassili Mountains of Al-
geria, made at the Musée de l’Homme under direction of Henri Lhote.

Among the accessions in the division of physical anthropology are
two casts of trephined skulls from Peru, one with five and the other
with seven openings; these will be exhibited as examples of the number
of trephine openings which have been made in a skull in vivo. Two
Kraho Indian face masks from central Brazil were made for the
Museum by Harold Schultz. One is to be incorporated in the map of
peoples of the world in the new hall of physical anthropology in prep-
aration. Other accessions include skeletal materials from Virginia,
Maryland, Latin America, and Alaska.

Zoology.—A currently accelerated program of field activities in the
division of mammals added 14,869 specimens to its collections. Field
parties working under the direction of Dr. Henry W. Setzer collected
more than 5,000 specimens from Africa and southwestern Asia. The
tropical areas of the Americas continued to provide large numbers
of specimens. Of special note are Dr. C. O. Handley’s general collec-
tions from Panama and Arthur M. Greenhall’s large collection of
bats from Trinidad. Important accessions also include a rare marbled
cat from Sumatra presented by Kent Crane, a series of baboons ob-
tained by Clifford E. Sanders in Northern Rhodesia, South American
marmosets received from the National Institutes of Health Primate
Colony at the San Diego Zoo through Robert W. Cooper, and a good
series of canids allied to red wolves from the south-central part of the
United States received through the Fish and Wildlife Service.

Accessions worthy of special note received in the division of birds

766—746—65——_3
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

include 547 bird skins, 26 skeletons, 1 egg, and 1 nest from Panama,
received through Dr. Alexander Wetmore; 791 bird skins, 85 skeletons,
and 1 nest from North America, by transfer from the Fish and Wild-
life Service; 301 bird skins from Formosa, by transfer from the De-
partment of Defense, Department of the Navy, U.S. Naval Medical
Research Unit No. 2, through Dr. R. E. Kuntz; 190 bird skins from
North Borneo, gift of the Bernice P. Bishop Museum through Dr.
J. L. Gressitt; 175 bird skins from West Pakistan, gift from Bucknell
University through Dr. Roy C. Tasker; 156 alcoholic specimens of
birds from Prof. D. S. Rabor, Suliman University, Dumaguete City,
Negros Oriental, Philippines; and 52 original watercolor paintings
executed as illustrations for F. Salomonson’s “The Birds of Green-
land” by deposit from the artist, Aage Gitz-Johansen, Trorod, Den-
mark, through Dr. Carl Christensen, Cultural Counselor, Embassy
of Denmark.

The division of reptiles and amphibians accessioned 2,639 specimens.
Outstanding among these are 58 West Indian lizards and frogs, in-
cluding paratypes of 13 new species and subspecies from Dr. Albert
Schwartz of Miami, Fla.; 213 reptiles and amphibians from Mada-
gascar collected by field parties under the direction of Dr. H. W. Setzer
of the division of mammals; and 219 reptiles and amphibians from
Darién, Panama, collected by Dr. Charles O. Handley, Jr., also of the
division of mammals.

Among the largest accessions made in the division of fishes during
the year were 5,777 specimens received by transfer from the U.S. Fish
and Wildlife Service, mostly through the efforts of Dr. Daniel Cohen,
Harvey R. Bullis, Jr., Willis King, J. H. Finucane, and P. J. Struh-
saker; a gift of 3,000 specimens of Panamanian fishes from Horace
Loftin, Florida State University; and through exchange, 6,020 Vir-
ginia fishes from Dr. Robert Ross, Virginia Polytechnic Institute.
Dr. Herbert R. Axelrod, T. F. H. Publications, Inc., Jersey City, N.J.,
donated 443 South American fishes and aided in securing 18 additional
ones. Especially important acquisitions are holotypic and paratypic
specimens received from Dr. Jacques R. Géry, Dordogne, France; Dr.
Edward C. Raney, Cornell University; Dr. John E. Randall, Univer-
sity of Puerto Rico; Dr. Eugenia Clark, Cape Haze Marine Labora-
tory; Wayne J. Baldwin, University of California; Dr. C. Lindsey,
University of British Columbia; Dr. J. L. B. Smith, Rhodes Univer-
sity, Grahamstown, South Africa; and Dr. Stanley Weitzman, asso-
ciate curator in the division of fishes. 'The addition of 47 shark speci-
mens, some undescribed and others representing species not previously
contained in the national collections, was made by the following:
Dr. J. C. Briggs, University of Texas; H. Heyamoto and Susumu
Kato, U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service; Donald Goff, Rehoboth Beach,
SECRETARY’S REPORT DAN

Del.; Dr. Carl L. Hubbs, Scripps Institution of Oceanography; Dr.
T. Abe, University of Tokyo, Japan; Dr. F. H. Talbot, South African
Museum; and Jeanette D. D’Aubrey, Oceanographic Research Insti-
tute, Durban, Natal, South Africa. Valuable specimens were also re-
ceived from Mac Entel, Sumac Tropical Fish Hatchery, Miami, Fla.

The addition of 27,003 Antarctic specimens to the division of marine
invertebrates, collected by Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt, was of special im-
portance. Dr. Schmitt, research associate of the division, participated
in the U.S. Antarctic Research Program aboard the USS Staten [sland
and made these collections during the Palmer Peninsula-South Shet-
lands Survey in 1963. Many existing gaps in the national collections
of the fauna of these regions have now been filled. Acquisition of the
A. Weir Bell collection of Oligochaeta, comprising about 900 slides of
sections of these worms, a catalog, and a library of separates of scien-
tific articles dealing with the oligochaetes, was a significant event
during the year. This important collection was obtained from Dr.
R. A. Boolootian, Department of Zoology, University of California,
Los Angeles. A collection of 2,216 specimens of polychaete worms
from the Bering Sea was received from Dr. Donald J. Reish, Long
Beach State College, Long Beach, Calif.

In the division of mollusks, 69,288 specimens were added during the
year, including 334 specimens from previously recorded accessions,
the largest annual increment since 1953-54. This large increase is due
mainly to three large accessions: The personal collection of Arnon L.
Mehring consisting of approximately 23,800 specimens; a collection
of 17,300 specimens mainly from Okinawa, Ryukyus, purchased
through the Chamberlain Fund; and 7,600 specimens gathered by Dr.
Harold A. Rehder in Tahiti utilizing funds provided by Gen. Frank R.
Schwengel in memory of his wife, Jeanne S. Schwengel. Other large
accessions include an exchange with the Academy of Natural Sciences
of Philadelphia of 1,350 specimens, and a gift of 1,480 specimens from
Duncan Emrich of Washington, D.C. Holotypes were received from
the Institute of Marine Science, University of Miami, through Dr.
F. M. Bayer; the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Laboratory, Pas-
cagoula, Miss., through Harvey R. Bullis, Jr.; and from Richard E.
Petit. A total of 843 specimens including a number of holotypes were
added to the helminthological collection during the year. The largest
accession, consisting of 339 lots collected in Panama in 1931-34, was
presented by Dr. A. O. Foster.

Entomology.—The division of Coleoptera received a total of 49,528
specimens in 66 accessions. Major contributions include the follow-
ing: 730 beetles from Nepal and Pakistan from Dr. J. Maldonado
Capriles, University of Puerto Rico; 1,000 North American ground
beetles from John D. Glaser, Baltimore, Md.; 5,500 beetles from Cen-
22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

tral America and the United States from Dr. John Kingsolver, Insect
Identification and Parasite Introduction Research Branch, U.S. De-
partment of Agriculture; and 1,100 Mexican beetles from Dr. Alfred
B. Lau, Mexican Indian Training Center, Cordoba, Vera Cruz,
Mexico.

As a result of field work conducted by members of the Smithsonian
staff the following were acquired: 1,100 miscellaneous South Ameri-
can beetles from Mrs. Doris H. Blake and Dr. Doris M. Cochran; 300
scarab beetles from South Carolina obtained by O. L. Cartwright;
and 85,600 miscellaneous Mexican and North American beetles col-
lected by Dr. Paul J. Spangler.

The division of Hemiptera received 81,757 specimens in 100 acces-

1,000 thin sections, including many type specimens, donated by Dr.
Edward Zeller.

Funds from the Walcott bequest were used to purchase more than
20,000 invertebrates, one of the world’s most complete collections from
the Jurassic and Cretaceous of Chile, from Mrs. Elsa de Biese, Santi-
ago, Chile. With the cooperation of the Arabian American Oil Co.,
and financed partly by Walcott funds, Drs. P. M. Kier and E. G. Kauff-
man of the Museum staff collected more than 25,000 specimens of a
variety of invertebrates from Mesozoic rocks of Saudi Arabia. The
Springer fund made possible the purchase of 1,023 blastoids and
crinoids from the Burlington limestone of Iowa and Missouri, and 120
Triassic echinoids from the Moenkopi formation of Utah.

Outstanding exchanges brought many important specimens includ-
ing 1,050 species of Jurassic and Cretaceous mollusks from the Geologi-
26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

cal Survey of Pakistan; 160 plastotypes of Mesozoic mollusks housed

vonian quarry in Lucas County, Ohio, received in an exchange with the
Chicago Natural History Museum.

An interesting collection of Pleistocene vertebrate remains from.
Cartersville, Ga., was donated to the Smithsonian Institution by
Shorter College of Rome, Ga. The assemblage represented includes at
least 20 species and is important as the most extensive Pleistocene verte-
brate fauna yet discovered in Georgia.

Tn the division of vertebrate paleontology two outstanding accessions
resulted from field collecting by the staff. Dr. C. L. Gazin assisted by
Franklin L. Pearce, collected approximately 350 specimens of early
Tertiary mammals. The specimens were taken principally from the
Middle Eocene Bridger formation of southwestern Wyoming, but in-
cluded also are small collections from the Paleocene of the Green River
and Fossil basins of southwestern Wyoming and from the Bison Basin
of south-central Wyoming. The collections are important for the
wealth of small forms, such as Primates, rodents, insectivores, and
carnivores from the Middle Eocene beds of the Bridger Basin.

Dr. D. H. Dunkle, assisted by Gladwyn B. Sullivan, collected ap-
proximately 307 fossil fishes mainly from new localities in the upper
Madera formation of Permian or possibly Pennsylvanian age in cen-
tral New Mexico and consisting principally of sharks and acanthodian,
paleoniscoid, and coelacanth fishes. Other important collections of
these forms were obtained from the Pennsylvanian Wea shale in Ne-
braska and Iowa. In addition, a small collection of Leptolepis re-
mains was made in the Jurassic Todilto limestone of New Mexico,
and various bones of arthrodires and crossopterygians were collected
in a Middle Devonian quarry in Ohio.

Mineral sciences —In all, 9,230 specimens were received in the divi-
sion of mineralogy. Outstanding among the many important gifts

1,469 carats, a 1,362-carat amethyst, and a heart-shaped kunzite weigh-
ing 880 carats. Received from an anonymous donor was the Portu-
guese diamond, a fine step-cut stone weighing 127.01 carats. The
Portuguese diamond is the largest cut diamond from Brazil and the
thirteenth largest in the world. In the 1920’s it was recut to its present
shape from a 150-carat cushion-shaped stone. Details of its early
history are unknown, but it is said that it was once owned by the
royal family of Portugal.

EKighty-three meteorites were accessioned during the year, 28 of
which were not previously represented in the collection, making this
the best year in some time. The most important single addition was
the collection of the late Arthur R. Allen of Trinidad, Colo. It con-
tained 45 meteorites and 636 grams of tektites and was purchased
by a grant from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration.
Specimens of particular interest were the 14 fine oriented individuals
of the Pasamonte, N. Mex., fall (totaling 1.3 kg.) and a Canyon
Diablo specimen containing a large diamond inclusion. Seven stony
meteorites that had not been previously known were included: Ala-
mosa, Colo. (1.8 kg.) ; Blackwell, Okla. (2.4 kg.) ; Georgetown, Colo.
(0.68 kg.) ; Mosquero, N. Mex. (1.6 kg.); Thatcher, Colo. (2 g.);
yeas ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

Tobe, Colo. (5.4 kg.) ; and Mosca, Colo. (6.1). Outstanding among
the donations was a specimen of the widely publicized Bogou iron
presented by President Maurice Yameogo of the Republic of Upper
Volta.

Science and technology.—tin the division of physical sciences an
outstanding accession was the gift from Vassar College of the large
telescope built in 1863 by Henry Fitz, one of America’s famous
telescope makers, and used by Maria Mitchell at Vassar. Preston Bas-
sett gave an 8-sided revolving mirror used by Albert Michelson in his
famous determination of the velocity of light in 1924. A Collins
helium cryostat, from Loyola University of New Orleans and Arthur
D. Little, Inc., and an earlier Collins cryogenic expansion machine,
from Samuel C. Collins, are basic artifacts in the recent development
of commercially available low-temperature apparatus.

In the section of chemistry, outstanding accessions relating to the
element fluorine were a replica of the platinum apparatus for electroly-
sis and distillation used by Henry Moissan in his epochal isolation of
fluorine (1886), and a commercial fluorine cell made by the Harshaw
Chemical Co., in 1942-43, and given the Museum by thecompany. The
Moissan apparatus was fabricated through the courtesy of the Baker
Platinum Division of Engelhard Industries, Inc.

The collection of adding and calculating machines in the section of
mathematics was notably enriched by the gift of 76 specimens from the
Victor Comptometer Corp. The gift includes several famous his-
torical machines, such as the Schilt adding machine of 1851, the oldest
European key-driven machine; a Bollee direct-multiplication machine,
one of only three such machines made by Louis Bollee between 1888
and 1892; and the famous Scheutz difference engine of 1853, the first
complete difference engine ever built. A replica of Charles Babbage’s
difference engine was donated by the International Business Machines
Corp.

Among the most outstanding accessions in the section of light
machinery and horology was a pocket watch made by Henry and James
F. Pitkin of East Hartford, Conn., in about 1838. This specimen is
an example of the first American attempt at watchmaking by machines.
Other significant acquisitions by this section were a splendid example
of a French skeleton clock of the late 18th century and a combination
lock patented in 1841 by Dr. Solomon Andrews, an American inventor.

The section of tools acquired the J. R. Brown Linear Dividing
Machine of 1859 from the Brown & Sharpe Co., which was a milestone
in the history of measurement in American manufacturing. A fully
operative reproduction of the gun-stocking lathe developed by Thomas
Blanchard in 1820-22 was also received. This pioneer machine, the
original of which is in the Springfield Armory in Springfield, Mass.,
SECRETARY’S REPORT 29

represents the beginning of American mass production by machine
tools. A rare 19th-century Holtzapffel ornamental turning lathe was
acquired with a very comprehensive collection of accessories. Edvard
Johansson, Royal Swedish Consul at Detroit, donated a set of Johans-
son gauge blocks for the hall. The adoption of the Johansson system
of gauges invented by his father, C. E. Johansson in the late 19th
century, revolutionized mass production by making it possible to
achieve universal interchangeability of machine parts. This particu-
lar set was the first to be produced in stainless steel and was made
especially to be given to the inventor on his 71st birthday in 1933. The
presentation was made in a formal ceremony in the hall of tools on
March 13 by the Royal Swedish Ambassador, His Excellency Hubert
de Besch.

Among the outstanding models received by the division of trans-
portation were a Pacific coast lumber steamer, a 4-masted barkentine,
and the schooner F7y of 1812. A model of the new class of fast freight
steamers, the American Challenger, 1962 record holder for the North
Atlantic crossing by a freighter, was received from the United States
Lines as a gift.

The oldest scale model of an American-built ship, His Majesty’s
44-oun ship America, built at Portsmouth, N.H., in 1746-1747, was
received as a 3-year loan by special agreement from the trustees of
the Portsmouth Athenaeum, Portsmouth, N.H. The model will be
repaired and exhibited by the marine section and, after a year, trans-
ferred to the division of naval history for a 2-year exhibition period.

Three early railway signals (1880-1905) were donated by Thomas
T. Taber to the section of land transportation. The vehicle collection
was enriched by several important additions. The Mack Bulldog
truck (1930) is the first commercial motor vehicle to be added to the
collection and was donated by Victor Ottilio & Sons. A fine Rocka-
way (1860) was the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Carl F. Flemer, Jr. A
Hack Passenger Wagon (1880), more commonly called a mud wagon,
was also added to the carriage collection.

The largest object accessioned in the division of electricity was an
85-ton alternating-current generator from the Adams station at Niag-
ara Falls, donated jointly by Niagara-Mohawk Power Corp. and
Westinghouse Electric Corp. It is this alternator that inaugurated
in 1895 the modern era of central stations distributing electrical power
over large areas. A somewhat smaller, but very important, magneto
generator was received from the University of Virginia. It was
made by Hippolyte Pixii in 1832 or 1833 and represents the first use
of a commutator for the production of direct current. Only two
other machines like this are known to exist in the world. A third
generator, by Charles Wheatstone, was obtained on indefinite loan
30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

from King’s College, University of London. It is one of the first
examples of a self-excited dynamo, a principle discovered coinci-
dentally by Wheatstone in England and Werner Siemens in Germany
in 1866. Excellent replicas of four alternating-current motors repre-
senting the pioneer work of Galileo Ferraris in 1885 were given to
the museum by the Associazione Elettrotecnica ed Elettronica Italiana
and Istituto Elettrotecnico Nazionale Galileo Ferraris of Turin.

Among the major accessions during the past year in the division
of medical sciences were a collection of tools and research apparatus
used in a late 19th century microbiology and biochemistry laboratory,
donated by the University of Michigan, and a 1953 hydraulic turbine
contra-angle handpiece with accessories and test model for dental
drilling from the National Bureau of Standards. Also acquired
were the office material, dental instruments, and personal memorabilia
of Dr. Charles E. Kells as a gift from his daughter, Mrs. J. O.
Pierson, through the School of Medicine of Tulane University. To
the pharmaceutical collection, an ancient Egyptian mortar and pestle,
weights, and amulets were added.

Civil history Several items with Presidential associations received
in the division of political history include a pair of leather chaps
worn by President Theodore Roosevelt in the Dakota Territory,
the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Kermit Roosevelt; a meerschaum pipe used
by President Ulysses S. Grant in the White House, from the estate
of George W. Crouch; one of the microphones used by President
Franklin D. Roosevelt during his “fireside chats” to the American
people in the 1930’s and 1940’s, the gift of the Columbia Broadcasting
System and WTOP-Radio, Washington, D.C.; a pen used on January
23, 1964, by President Lyndon B. Johnson to sign the bill establishing
the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, the gift of
Senator Clinton P. Anderson. Important additions made to the First
Ladies Collection are two dresses worn by Mrs. Grover Cleveland as
First Lady and an evening cape that had belonged to her; these were
the gift of Mr. and Mrs. Richard F. Cleveland. One of the new
dresses, of black satin and iridescent taffeta, now represents Mrs.
Cleveland in the exhibit in the First Ladies Hall.

The division of cultural history received the frame and woodwork
of an entire house, the gift of Alexander B. C. Mulholland; built in
Ipswich, Mass., the older portion of this house dates from the late 17th
century, the Jater from about 1750. The Honorable David Bruce pre-
sented 18-century woodwork and paneling from two rooms of a
Charleston, S.C., house. The architecture of Louis Sullivan is repre-
sented in one lot of ornaments from his Chicago Stock Exchange

an 18th-century account and letter book of Alexander Smith of
Alexandria, from Mrs. Jean M. Dodd; two mahogany side chairs
from Mrs. Wellington Powell; and four side chairs and a Pennsyl-
vania rocking chair from Mrs. George Maurice Morris. The family
of Harry T. Peters donated a poster advertising a traveling menagerie
from the Zoological Institute of New York City, dated 1835, a rare and
early example of its kind.

To the division of numismatics was added an original pewter strik-
ing of the noted Castorland token made for the officers of the French
colony established at Carthage, N.Y., 1796, and a rare pattern half
dollar of 1916, both given by Ben Douglas. Other outstanding addi-
tions to the United States series were a $20 gold piece in high relief
and a $10 gold piece originally owned by Henry Hering, who com-
pleted the design of these coins in 1907 for Augustus St. Gaudens, and
Mr. Hering’s notes concerning the history of this gold coinage and
the interest of President Theodore Roosevelt; these were the gift of
Stack’s of New York. A die used by the J. J. Conway Co. of Colorado
in the striking of a private $5 gold piece was donated by Robert Bash-
low. Joseph B. Stack gave tintypes of the Bechtler family, well-
known private gold coiners from North Carolina, a daguerreotype of
John Little Moffat, a leading coiner in San Francisco during the gold
rush, and the notebook of the mint engraver J. B. Longacre concerning
the design of the 1856 flying eagle cent.

An important collection of silver bars, bullet money, and various
forms of media of exchange used in Siam and China were donated by
Mrs. F. C. C. Boyd; Harvey Stack gave the Edith and Jean Jacques
Ture collection of necessity pieces issued in France and the French
colonies during the 1914-26 period. Willis du Pont added 645 coins
struck during the second part of the reign of Catherine II of Russia
and 210 Russian silver and bronze medals. Mrs. Wayte Raymond

Arts and manufactures.—Ralph E. Becker presented to the division
of textiles a comprehensive collection of silk Jacquard woven pic-
tures. These interesting examples of an unusual weaving art date
from 1867 through the 1930’s. The wide variety of subjects include
pictures of Columbus sighting America, Betsy Ross stitching the
flag, and facsimilies of the signatures of the Declaration of Independ-
ence. An excellent collection of American needlework was presented
by Dr. Margaret R. Sandels. One of the embroidered pictures, “The
Sea Beast,” of Mrs. Theodore Roosevelt, Jr., a noted needlewoman,
was given by Mr. and Mrs. Sidney de la Rue. A colorful 18th-
century floral border by the distinguished French designer Philippe
de Lasalle was added to the brocade collection.

Mrs. Clara W. Berwick supplemented her previous gifts to the
division of ceramics and glass by 74 pieces of rare early American
glass and 22 European and Oriental ivories. Robert H. McCauley

Frankenthal, and Ludwigsburg, and of the extremely rare Viennese
porcelain of the DuPaquier period.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 33

The most important accession received in the division of graphic
arts was a bequest of 243 Currier & Ives lithographs of sporting and
western subjects from the Adele S. Colgate Estate. This gift greatly
enhances the standing of the Museum’s collection of Currier & Ives
prints. The important gift of Erich Cohn of 20 drawings and etch-
ings by the German expressionist artists Paul Kleinschmidt and Lud-
wig Meidner reflects what was probably the strongest group contri-
bution to printmaking in this century. The Society of Washington
Printmakers donated, through its president, Prentiss Taylor, the in-
taglio print Zmage IZ, by Lois Fine; the woodcut The Valley, by
Tsabella Walker; and the lithograph Nova Scotia, by Louis Lozowick.

The section of photography acquired a number of historically note-
worthy specimens of photographs and equipment. Lucien G. Bull
of Paris presented a large group of material related to the early his-
tory of high-speed photography, consisting of original negatives,
prints, and an electromechanical timing device. Ansco, Binghamton,
N.Y., presented a model of a photographic wagon of the type used by
Mathew Brady during the Civil War. Nikon, Inc., presented a “Niko-
nos” 35-mm. underwater camera, with watertight lens and body, for
use under water without a protective housing. The Vew York Daily
Mirror donated a lightweight Zeiss Ikon, Ernemann plate camera,
originally purchased in the 1930’s by William Randolph Hearst to
replace the bulkier cameras used by his newspapers, and another spe-
cially designed camera intended to take pictures from a concealed
position.

The division of manufactures and heavy industries continued to
collect for the various halls planned for the Museum of History and
Technology. New York University presented to the section of nuclear
energy the first subcritical reactor to be installed in a teaching institu-
tion. Improvised from 2 tons of fuel lent by the U.S. Atomic Energy
Commission and installed in a pickle barrel, the university was able to
secure at a cost of $1,500 a teaching research facility which might
otherwise have been unattainable.

Youngstown Sheet & Tube Co. presented a model of an electric weld
pipe mill for the hall of iron and steel. A malleable iron air furnace
was given by Erie Malleable Iron Co.; and some Roman nails from the
Inchtuthil excavation in Scotland came from Colvilles, Ltd., of
Glasgow.

The section of petroleum received further gifts as a result of the
excellent work of the American Petroleum Institute’s subcommittee.
Among these were an animated model of a modern sea-going drilling
installation from Kerr-McGee Oil Industries, Inc.; three models of
drilling rigs from the Lee C. Moore Corp.; and an interesting survey
model of the Velma field from Skelly Oil Co.
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

The division of agriculture and forest products has been principally
concerned with obtaining materials for the hall of forest products.
The Forest Products Laboratory, Department of Agriculture, Mad-
ison, Wis., gave a swellograph—a device that measures swelling
changes in wood having a finished surface. Larus & Brother Co.,
Inc., reproduced a tobacco hogshead like those used 125 to 150 years
ago. Permali, Inc., contributed samples of machined parts for elec-
trical equipment and Fibron Products, Buffalo, N.Y., gave 17 hand-
some pieces of compressed wood products. To the agricultural collec-
tion has been added catalogs of agricultural implement companies
around 1880 belonging to Sylvanus D. Locke, the inventor of the
famous wire binder. Gordon Dentry donated a four-tined wooden
fork used by his grandfather and possibly his great-grandfather in
Baltimore County, Md.

Armed Forces history.—A fine example of a Gatling gun was pre-
sented by the Armed Forces of Honduras. Mrs. George C. Marshall
presented several uniforms worn by General of the Army George C.
Marshall during World War II. The division of naval history made
significant additions to the national collection of historic warship
models while projecting further units required to complete the hall of
armed forces history. Particularly notable was a rigged model of
Robert Fulton’s Steam Battery, the world’s first steam man-of-war,
which was built by Adam and Noah Brown in 1814 for the defense of
New York. Plans for this 26-gun blockship were provided by How-
ard I. Chapelle who in 1961 discovered a contemporary draft of
the Steam Battery in the Danish Royal Archives at Copenhagen. By
happy coincidence, the division of naval history also received an origi-
nal Fulton draft of the armored torpedo boat Mute presented by
the family of George F. Brown, descendants of her versatile builders,
the Brown brothers of New York. The emergence of the steam navy
was further represented with the completion of a superb model of
the side-wheel steamer Powhatan, which served with Commodore
Perry in the opening of Japan.

Through the generosity of the U.S. Coast Guard, the division of
naval history received a fully equipped beach cart of the type used by
the Life Saving Service for offshore rescue, a set of range lights from
Alaska, and an oil painting by Hunter Wood of the topsail schooner
Massachusetts, first cutter commissioned by the early Revenue Marine.

A patent model of the revolutionary K-1 firing device, the heart of
the antenna mine employed in the North Sea mine barrage during
World War I, was presented by Mrs. Ralph C. Browne, widow of its
gifted inventor. Vivid memories of the Battle of Midway were evoked
by the bullet-torn flight jacket and combat decorations donated by
George H. Gay, sole survivor of Torpedo Squadron 8.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 35

Among the more important objects acquired by the section of under-
water exploration during the year are ships’ fittings and equipment
from a wreck site in Bermuda believed to date from the 1560’s. These
include a bar shot, several single blocks, two parrels, small- and
medium-sized deadeyes, and a large collection of ceramic sherds, some
of which will yield nearly complete vessels when reconstructed.

RESEARCH, EXPLORATION, AND FIELDWORK

Dr. T. D. Stewart, director of the Museum of Natural History,
accompanied by exhibits specialist John C. Widener, went to Mexico
City in mid-December 1963, the former to select examples of pre-
historic filed and inlayed human teeth and the latter to make molds
thereof. Mr. Widener will make casts from the molds for an exhibit
in the planned hall of physical anthropology.

Dr. Stewart, serving as a member of the Committee on Research
and Exploration of the National Geographic Society, inspected the
Wetherill Mesa archeological project in Mesa Verde National Park
late in June, stopping off enroute from a second trip to Mexico City
where he attended the 33d annual meeting of the American Associa-
tion of Physical Anthropologists.

At various times during the year Dr. I. E. Wallen, assistant director
for oceanography, visited institutions in Massachusetts, Rhode Island,
New York, Virginia, North Carolina, Georgia, Florida, Mississippi,
Louisiana, Texas, California, and Hawaii in connection with the
program of the Smithsonian Oceanographic Sorting Center. He also
prepared several short papers dealing with developments in ocean-
ography and the role of the Sorting Center.

Dr. H. Adair Fehlmann, supervisor of the Smithsonian Oceano-
graphic Sorting Center, participated in Cruise 4B of the R/V Anton
Bruun, of the International Indian Ocean Expedition, from early
November to mid-December. This trip gave him a useful oppor-
tunity to study curatorial procedures on shipboard and to determine
the need for a trained technician to oversee the handling of biological
samples from the time of collection to the time the specimen cargo is
consigned for shipment to the Sorting Center. Thanks to his recom-
mendations, future collections should come through in better condition
and with more complete documentation. Dr. Fehlmann also had an
opportunity to observe the techniques and equipment used in handling
plankton in the Indian Ocean Biological Laboratory at Ernakulam,
South India.

Chairman of the department of anthropology Waldo R. Wedel com-
pleted a review of the prehistory and aboriginal ecology of north-
central Colorado in which he emphasizes the importance of the foot-
hills-hogback strip between the Plains and the Front Range in the

766-746—65——4
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

history of the region. In addition, he continued work on two manu-
scripts, one dealing with the 1961-62 Smithsonian excavations at the
Lamb Spring archeological-paleontological site near Littleton, Colo.,
and the other with the 1952 Smithsonian-Princeton investigations at
an ancient bison kill near Cody, Wyo. The latter site has recently
been dated by the radiocarbon method at 8,750-8,840 years ago. At
the close of the year he was back in the Middle West.

Dr. Clifford Evans, curator of archeology, and research associate
Betty J. Meggers completed a major monograph on the Valdivia and
Machalilla phases of the Early Formative period of coastal Ecuador.
Twenty-two dates obtained by processing shell and charcoal samples
in the Smithsonian’s Carbon Dating Laboratory convincingly bracket
the Valdivia phase at 5,150 to 3,400 years ago.

After joing the staff in December as associate curator of arche-
ology, Dr. Richard B. Woodbury made two trips to the Tehuacan
Valley in southern Puebla, Mexico, in continuation of his research on
preindustrial systems of water management in arid regions. He found
evidence of large-scale irrigation from Late Formative times on, that
is, for about 2,500 years—probably the longest record of irrigation
in the New World. Dr. Woodbury also continued working with re-
search associate Nathalie F.S. Woodbury on a report dealing with the
Hawikuh archeological site in New Mexico, based on the unpublished
records obtained in 1917-23 by the late F. W. Hodge, following his
departure from the Smithsonian’s Bureau of American Ethnology.

In collaboration with Drs. Glen H. Cole of the Uganda Museum and
A. Jamme of the Catholic University of America, Dr. Gus Van Beek,
associate curator of archeology, completed a preliminary report on an
archeological reconnaissance in Wadi Hadhramaut, South Arabia,
undertaken in 1961-62. He also spent several weeks during April
and May in an archeological reconnaissance in Yemen, at the invitation
of the Yemen Arab Republic Government. On the way back to the
States he visited sites in Ethiopia and conferred with colleagues in
Aden and Jordan.

Museum specialist George Metcalf continued his studies of arche-
ological materials from central Nebraska, encouraged by 11th- to 14th-
century site dates supplied by the Smithsonian’s Carbon Dating
Laboratory. Dr. C. G. Holland, honorary collaborator, having visited
161 archeological sites in southwestern Virginia in 1963, progressed
with his analysis of the collections and site data. Honorary research
associate Neil M. Judd completed his final monograph (Zhe Architec-
ture of Pueblo Bonito) relating to the archeology of Chaco Canyon,
N. Mex. During the summer of 1963, Dr. John M. Campbell, honor-
ary research associate, carried out an archeological and ecological
survey of the Koyukuk River drainage in northern Alaska. Follow-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 37

ing this trip he continued preparation of a monograph on Nunamiut
Eskimo prehistory.

Dr. Saul H. Riesenberg, curator of ethnology, completed a mono-
graph on the aboriginal political organization of Ponape, Caroline
Islands. In addition, he progressed with the report on the megalithic
structures of Nan Madol, Ponape, where a Smithsonian joint arche-
ological-ethnological field project last year produced finds of unusual
interest and made possible an evaluation by different disciplinary
approaches.

Intensive exhibit work in the hall of the cultures of Africa and Asia,
opened informally at the end of the year, left little time for other
research by the associate curators involved, Drs. Gordon Gibson and
Eugene Knez. On the other hand, associate curator William Crocker
spent 2 weeks in July 1963 and approximately 4 months early in 1964
with the Canela Indians of Brazil, a tribe threatened with extinction.
He was again with them as the year ended. Between trips to Brazil
Dr. Crocker prepared two articles based on the Canela investigations.

Dr. J. Lawrence Angel, curator of physical anthropology, com-
pleted two manuscripts, one on osseous changes in the hip joint and
the other on the human skeletons associated with extinct animals at
the Tranquility site, California; he completed a paper on hyperostosis
spongiosa to be included in a volume on paleopathology. With his
technical assistant, Donald Ortner, Dr. Angel worked out a special
form which will permit rapid coding of data on the anthropology of
chronic disease for computer analysis. These data have been ob-
tained mainly in a long-term study of students at Jefferson Medical
College in Philadelphia, some of whom were restudied this year.

At the beginning of the year Miss L. E. Hoyme, then museum spe-
cialist (now associate curator of physical anthropology), was in Eng-
land studying 19th-century skeletons of known age and sex at St.
Bride’s Church, Fleet Street, London, and visiting laboratories of
physical anthropology. In July she successfully defended her doc-
toral dissertation at Oxford University and in December received her
degree in absentia.

From the end of January to the beginning of April the chairman
of the department of zoology, Dr. Horton H. Hobbs, Jr., participated
in the Bredin-Archbold-Smithsonian Biological Survey of Dominica,
studying the fresh-water decapod crustaceans of the island. As time
permitted, he completed a manuscript on new entocytherids from Vir-
ginia and made progress on a revision of the entocytherid ostracods
of Mexico and Cuba.

Senior scientist Fenner A. Chace, Jr., completed a study initiated
by the late Belle A. Stevens on the mesopelagic caridean shrimp
Notostomus japonicus Bate in the northeastern Pacific. Also, he
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

finished a report on the decapod crustaceans of the island of St.
Helena in the South Atlantic.

Although the curator of mammals, Dr. David H. Johnson, was re-
sponsible for the general development of exhibits in the hall of oste-
ology opened at the end of the year, he found time to study the
distribution of hares and certain species of bats in southeastern Asia
and to continue his general survey of the mammals of that area.

For the better part of the year, Dr. Henry W. Setzer, associate cura-
tor of mammals, directed from Washington the work in Iran and
southern Africa of field parties collecting mammals and their ecto-
parasites. This program was carried out in cooperation with the
Army Medical Research and Development Command. Dr. Setzer
joined the African party in mid-September and the Iranian party in
late October, staying until mid-December. His museum work con-
sisted chiefly of identification of mammals from Egypt and the Sudan
collected by a Naval Medical Research Unit.

From January to March Dr. Charles O. Handley, Jr., associate
curator of mammals, collected specimens in the high mountains on
the Colombian frontier of Darién Province, Panama, obtaining among
other valuable materials, two species of bats new to the Panamanian
fauna and a number of rare marsupials, shrews, and rodents. Late in
June, in connection with attendance at a meeting of the American
Society of Mammalogists in Mexico City, Dr. Handley spent 8 days
studying fruit bats in the Instituto de Biologia. This filled one of
the last major gaps in his revision of this large and complex genus.

Dr. Robert A. Traub of the University of Maryland Medical School,
honorary research associate in the division of mammals, was in Paki-
stan from the beginning of the fiscal year until October collecting
mammals and other vertebrates and their ectoparasites in continuation
of his studies of rickettsial infections.

The Pacific Ocean Biological Survey Program, under the direction
of Dr. Philip S. Humphrey, curator of birds, has increased greatly
in scope since its inception in October 1962. Because of its concern
with the distribution, migrations, and ecology of central Pacific sea
birds, collaborative relationships have been developed with the U.S.
Bureau of Commercial Fisheries, the Bernice P. Bishop Museum, the
State of Hawaii Division of Fish and Game, and others. Of approxi-
mately 50 people employed this year on the project many were gradu-
ate students who were gathering data for doctoral dissertations.

The Rockefeller Foundation has provided support for a field study
enabling Dr. Humphrey to work with the Belém Virus Laboratory,
Fundacao Servico Especial de Satide Ptiblica, and the Museu Paraense
“Emilio Goeldi,” Belém, Brazil. This cooperative field study deals
with the relationship of birds and arthropod-borne virus diseases. As
SECRETARY'S REPORT 39

time permitted, Dr. Humphrey continued his studies of plumage suc-
cession in birds and on the distribution, ecology, and classification of
Patagonian and Brazilian birds. At the close of the year he was
back in Brazil.

From the beginning of December 1963 to the latter part of March
1964, George E. Watson, associate curator of birds, served as official
United States representative (observer) with the Chilean-Antarctic
Commission. During delays in Chile for ship repairs and for the ice
to break up he was able to spend 13 days in December at Peulla, Llan-
quihue Province, observing and collecting forest birds. During
another delay of 22 days in January-February at Puerto Williams,
he was able to make a catalog of birds breeding on Navarino Island
and to collect specimens, among which are several important additions
to the national collections. Mr. Watson’s observations of birds made
on shipboard in Antarctic waters will be useful in preparing an identi-
fication guide to Antarctic birds which he has planned. Upon his
return from Chile he completed his doctoral dissertation dealing with
ecology and evolution of passerine birds on the islands of the Aegean
Sea and received in June the Ph.D. degree from Yale University.

Dr. Richard L. Zusi, associate curator of birds, spent a week in
November at the University of Michigan working on three manu-
scripts, which he had begun there, and consulting with Dr. R. W. Storer
concerning their joint research project on the myology of grebes.
From January to April he was in Dominica studying birds as a par-
ticipant in the Bredin-Archbold-Smithsonian biological survey of that
island.

In continuation of his long-term field work on the birdlife of the
Isthmus of Panama, Dr. Alexander Wetmore, honorary research asso-
ciate and retired Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, concen-
trated his efforts from January through March in Darién Province,
mainly in the heavy rainforest adjacent to the Colombian boundary.
The results were most successful, for both specimens of and observa-
tions on species that have been little known in Panama were obtained,
and several new records of South American birds not previously
recorded in the area were established.

Dr. Herbert Friedmann, honorary research associate and former
curator of the division, continued his work on brood parasitism and
completed a manuscript dealing with evolutionary trends in the avian
genus Clamator.

Herbert G. Deignan, honorary research associate and former mem-
ber of the division, was in Washington from mid-January to late April
studying birds from Formosa in the Naval Medical Research Unit
(NAMRU) collections and those from Viet-Nam and Cambodia col-
lected by Bernard Feinstein, former museum specialist in the division.
40 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

Two new honorary research associates appointed this year, Prof.
D. S. Rabor of Silliman University, Philippine Islands, and Dr. Rob-
ert W. Ficken of the University of Maryland, carried on important
research. Prof. Rabor worked on the general ornithology of the Phil-
ippine Islands; Dr. Ficken undertook extensive field and laboratory
research on the behavior of wood warblers.

Honorary research associate Oliver L. Austin, Jr., continued his
technical editorial work on the two final volumes of A. C. Bent’s
Life Histories of North American Birds.

Dr. Doris M. Cochran, curator of reptiles and amphibians, in collab-
oration with Dr. C. J. Goin of Gainsville, Fla., made considerable
progress on a manuscript dealing with Colombian frogs.

The curator of fishes, Dr. Leonard P. Schultz, accompanied by
exhibits specialist Alfred Strohlein, spent a few days in October in
the vicinity of Seattle, Wash., in search of a salmon-spawning area
that would provide material for a diorama for the planned hall of
cold-blooded vertebrates. They were successful and in addition
returned with an 89-pound octopus, donated by the Point Defiance
Aquarium at Tacoma. Otherwise Dr. Schultz continued his study of
frogfishes and his recording of shark attacks throughout the world.

Two associate curators of the division of fishes, Drs. Robert H.
Gibbs, Jr., and Ernest A. Lachner, participated this year in cruises of
the International Indian Ocean Expedition. Dr. Gibbs was on
Cruise 3 of the R/V Anton Bruun, the primary purpose of which was
to sample deep-sea ichthyofauna in the western Indian Ocean and to
relate the distributions of species and biomass to the physicochemical
and biological properties of the water masses sampled in a north-
south transect. The cruise began at Bombay on August 8 and termi-
nated at Port Louis, Mauritius, on September 20. Following the
cruise Dr. Gibbs spent 2 months working at museums in Paris, Berlin,
Hamburg, Bremerhaven, and Copenhagen.

Dr. Lachner was on Cruise 4B of the same ship, the major objec-
tive of which was to evaluate the relative distribution and abundance
of benthic organisms inhabiting the continental shelf and upper slope
of the Arabian Sea. This cruise began at Bombay on November 12
and terminated off the Muscat coast of Arabia in mid-December. On
his way to and from the cruise Dr. Lachner visited institutions in
London, Paris, Bern, Jerusalem, Karachi, Sydney, Brisbane, Hong
Kong, and several places in Japan.

Dr. Victor G. Springer, associate curator of fishes, expanded his
studies on sharks, completing revisions of three genera. During the
year he visited Stanford University and musems in Hamburg, Paris,
and London, studying blennioid fish types and other specimens and
bringing close to completion a revision of the genus Z'ntomacrodus.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 41

Dr. William R. Taylor, associate curator of fishes, developed a new
technique in the preparation of specimens for osteological study in-
volving the use of solutions of the enzyme trypsin buffered with sodium
borate. This treatment, which removes the muscle tissue, has proved
effective in making both preserved and fresh specimens translucent ; the
connective tissue, cartilage, bones, viscera, and major nerves remaining.

Associate curator Stanley H. Weitzman completed a study of two
genera of Asiatic minnows, three manuscripts dealing with South
American catfishes, and a study of the osteology and relationships
of the characid subfamilies Lebiasininae and Erythrininae.

Dr. J. A. F. Garrick, honorary research associate, who worked in
the division of fishes last year, returned to his home in Wellington,
New Zealand, where he is continuing his world revision of carcha-
rhinid sharks. During May he visited Australia to study specimens
of sharks not available in museums of Europe, America, or Africa.
His critical revision of carcharhinid sharks is the first ever attempted.

From the end of December 1963 to mid-February 1964 Dr. Donald
F’. Squires, curator of marine invertebrates, was a participant in the
“MacQuarie Gap” cruise of the New Zealand Oceanographic Institute
aboard HMNZS Hndeavour. Although the nominal purpose of the
cruise was to determine the topographic relationship between the
MacQuarie Ridge and New Zealand, considerable marine biological
work was scheduled. To Dr. Squires’s profit, 11 of the 79 bottom
dredgings and bottom trawls contained living corals. Through use
of the ship’s refrigerators, these were kept alive for up to 10 days, thus
advancing culturing techniques. The most significant advance in
marine knowledge resulting from the cruise was the location and
dredging of the first deep-water coral structure found outside the
North Atlantic.

In the museum, Dr. Squires finished, with the assistance of Ian W.
Keys, senior paleontological technician, New Zealand Geological Sur-
vey, a study of the biomechanics of the scleractinian coral Manicina
areolata. He also completed several other studies on fossil and recent
corals.

Associate curator Thomas EK. Bowman completed an account of an
arostrate population of the planktonic calanoid copepod Acartia
lilljeborgii, from St. Lucia, West Indies. He described a new genus
and species of cirolanid isopod from Madison Cave, Va., the first
troglobitic cirolanid to be found in the United States outside of Texas;
a new anthurid isopod from the Caguanes Caves in Cuba; and a new
mysid crustacean, abundant in Lake Ponchartrain, La. With L. J.
Lancaster, he described a bloom of the planktonic blue-green alga
Skujaella in the Tonga Islands.

During most of April and May associate curator Charles E. Cut-
ress, Jr., accompanied by Kjell Sandved serving as photographer,
42 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

collected marine materials along the coasts of Hawaii and southern
California to be used in planned exhibits. Following this trip Mr. Cut-
ress visited the Friday Harbor Laboratory of the University of Wash-
ington in search of clarification of the taxonomy of the swimming
anemones Stomphia.

Dr. Raymond B. Manning, who joined the staff at the end of last
year as associate curator of marine invertebrates, in May and June
teamed with a research group from the Institute of Marine Science,
University of Miami, for a 20-day offshore scientific cruise in the
Gulf of Guinea. Following the cruise he spent several days collecting
inshore marine invertebrates near Dakar, Senegal, before visiting
natural history museums in Paris, Leiden, and London to study types
of stomatopod crustaceans.

During the year, Dr. Manning finished most of a manuscript revis-
ing the stomatopods of the western Atlantic, collaborated with L. B.
Holthuis, of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie, on a con-
tribution dealing with stomatopods for the publication “Treatise on
Invertebrate Paleontology,” and completed two additional manu-
scripts on these animals.

Associate curator Marian H. Pettibone completed a revision of
the polychaete family Pilargiidae, including a description of three
new species from Virginia.

Museum specialist Henry B. Roberts completed a description of a
new genus of Cretaceous crab, redescribed the Cretaceous crab Cam-
pylostoma pierrense Rathbun, and compiled a checklist and bibli-
ography of the Pleistocene decapods of the Atlantic and Gulf Coastal
Plain.

Dr. Waldo L. Schmitt, honorary research associate, completed the
revision of “Crustaceans,” a popular account prepared a few decades
ago for the Smithsonian Scientific Series.

Curator Harald A. Rehder continued work on a study of the marine
mollusks of Polynesia. He sorted and arranged the material he
gathered in Tahiti last year, and identified and studied specimens from
Tongoand Hawaii. <A bibliography of Polynesian marine malacology
was initiated, and progress was made on his monograph of the Har-
pidae and on a study of certain species of the family Volutidae.

From late October to late December, Dr. Joseph Rosewater, asso-
ciate curator of mollusks, participated in the International Indian
Ocean Expedition, Auxiliary Cruise “A” aboard the R/V Ze Vega.
After a delay of 2 weeks in Singapore for ship repairs, which gave
him an opportunity to make local collection, the ship headed north
through the Straits of Malacca along the west coast of Malaysia with
stops at Kuala Lumpur and Penang, then to Phuket, Thailand, and
north to the Similan Islands, westward to Sumatra and southeast-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 43

ward down the Mentawai Islands south of Sumatra as far as Mega.
Unfortunately, a break in the drive shaft occurred about 60 miles
southeast of Padang, cutting the cruise short by about 2 weeks. How-
ever, there was obtained in the areas visited a representative collection
of mollusks in which new records and range extentions already have
been noted.

Associate curator Joseph P. E. Morrison completed a manuscript
describing new species of the families Hydrobiidae, Pyramidellidae,
and Mactridae, from Louisiana.

Dr. J. F. Gates Clarke, chairman of the new Department of Entomol-
ogy, accompanied by Mrs. Clarke, visited the island of Rapa (Austral
group) in French Polynesia from the beginning of September to mid-
December. A large collection of Microlepidoptera and other insect
groups was obtained, including 760 specimens reared by Mrs. Clarke.
Also, the food plants of more than half of the approximately 75
species collected were ascertained and immature stages of all reared
species were preserved. ‘This is the first time that such information
has been available for these small moths. A preliminary examination
of the Microlepidoptera from Rapa suggests a close relationship with
those in New Zealand and the Indo-Australian area.

In June Dr. Clarke spent 5 days on Mount Magazine in the Ozark
National Forest of the Ouachita Mountains, Ark. The nearly 3,000
specimens he collected, of which 1,222 are Microlepidoptera, help fill
a gap in the national collection.

Dr. Clarke completed a paper on the genera Orsotricha and Pali-
norsa of the families Gelechiidae and Oecophoridae, respectively.

Associate curators of Lepidoptera Don R. Davis and W. Donald
Duckworth made a joint collection trip from early July to mid-August
to a hitherto poorly collected area in northeastern Mexico that extends
along the main highway south from Nuevo Loredo and eastward to
the Gulf coast between Tampico and Tuxpan. Interest centered pri-
marily on the microlepidopterous families Prodoxidae and Stenomidae
with the result that much larval material was collected and many new
records acquired. The total collection, including representatives of
other insect groups, amounts to approximately 25,000 specimens.

From mid-April to the end of May, Dr. Duckworth again went into
the field, this time to Barro Colorado Island, Panama. Through the
help of Mrs. Duckworth another 25,000 specimens were collected here.

Dr. Davis completed a revision of the subfamily Prodoxinae and
Dr. Duckworth completed several papers dealing with the large family
Stenomidae.

In July associate curator of Lepidoptera William D. Field made a
28-day collecting trip for Rhopalocera through the mountains of New
York and New England. Large series of several species of butterflies
44 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

needed for the national collection were taken. In May Mr. Field spent
12 days in the entomologically neglected area of western Virginia and
West Virginia collecting information, especially on the extent of the
ranges of boreal species in the southern mountains.

At the close of the year Dr. O. L. Cartwright, curator of Coleoptera,
was on a trip to London and Paris to study type specimens of scarab
beetles of the Bahamas and Micronesia.

Dr. Paul J. Spangler, associate curator of Coleoptera, spent 7 weeks
during July and August in Mexico and southwestern United States
collecting much needed material for his investigations on water beetles.
So little is known about the merging of the Nearctic and Neotropical
Zones in Mexico that all expeditions to this area are pointed toward the
elucidation of this factor. Not less than 6 of the genera collected
represent new records for Mexico and not less than 20 species are new
to science. Larvae for nearly all the species were collected, and all the
information on immature forms is new. Specimens of semiaquatic
beetles of the very rare family Georyssidae were collected in quantity.

Ralph E. Crabill, Jr., curator of Myriapoda and Arachnida, was
in Europe at the beginning of the fiscal year and stayed there until
mid-August, during which time he visited the Zoologische Samlung
des Bayerischen Staates, Munich, and the British Museum (Natural
History) for the purpose of studying typical and ordinary chilopod
specimens. In upper Bavaria and northern Austria he undertook
four collecting trips which netted some 1,200 specimens, including some
topotypes and a host of species not previously represented in the
national collections.

From mid-July to mid-August, Dr. Oliver S. Flint, Jr., associate
curator of neuropteroids, was on a field trip to the islands of Jamaica,
Dominica, St. Lucia, and Grenada, conducting studies on the Antillean
caddisfly fauna. During 4 days spent on Jamaica and about a week
each on the other islands he collected 2,000-3,000 insects, of which 500
or more are Trichoptera. In April and June he was back in Dominica
as a participant in the Bredin-Archbold-Smithsonian biological sur-
vey of that island. Dr. Flint completed two papers dealing with
certain species of Nearctic Trichoptera in the collection of the Museum
of Comparative Zoology, Cambridge, and new species discovered in
the United States.

Jason R. Swallen, chairman of the department of botany, visited
South Africa in September and October at the invitation of the
National Botanic Gardens of South Africa to join in the Golden Jubi-
lee Celebration of the Gardens. The celebration included over a
month’s tour of the country, which afforded an opportunity to collect
about 200 specimens of grasses, including a number of species new to
the National Herbarium.

SECRETARY’S REPORT 45

Associate curator of phanerogams Velva E. Rudd continued work
on her manuscript on the papilionoid legumes of Mexico, bringing part
one to completion. In connection with her studies in the Leguminosae,
she spent 6 days in September at the herbarium of the Universidad
Nacional Auténomo de México in Mexico City. This research oppor-
tunity was afforded by her attendance at the Secundo Congreso Mexi-
cano de Botanica, which met in San Luis Potosi.

From mid-June through August, Dr. Stanwyn G. Shetler, associate
curator of phanerogams, traveled to Alaska and collected plants in the
western Brooks Range with a University of Alaska expedition. He
also studied collections in the herbarium of the University of Alaska
and searched for a suitable setting for a diorama planned for the hall
of plant life.

Associate curator of phanerogams Wallace R. Ernst completed a
manuscript on “The Genus /’schscholzia in the South Coast Ranges of
California” and, with Dr. H. J. Thompson of the University of Cal-
ifornia, Los Angeles, another manuscript on the pollination patterns
and taxonomy of the genus Hwenide. At the American Institute of
Biological Sciences (AIBS) meetings at Amherst, Mass., in August his
joint paper with Dr. Thompson won an award in taxonomy. During
the last 3 months of the year he was in Dominica, participating in the
Bredin-Archbold-Smithsonian biological survey of that island.

Associate curator of phanerogams Dan H. Nicolson, along with
associate curators Stanwyn Shetler and David Lellinger, visited the
Great Smoky Mountains National Park in May in search of sites usable
in preparing an eastern deciduous forest life-group in the planned Hall
of Plant Life.

At the beginning of the fiscal year Dr. Thomas R. Soderstrom,
associate curator of grasses, was in the Wilhelmina Mountains of
Surinam, on a New York Botanical Garden expedition which col-
lected until October. About from 5 to 8 percent of the collections
represent grasses, all of which, including duplicates, are being iden-
tified in the National Herbarium for distribution to major herbaria.

C. V. Morton, curator of ferns, spent 3 weeks during July in librar-
ies in London and Paris checking bibliographic information in con-
nection with his study of the photographs he made of fern types
in European herbaria. With associate curator David B. Lellinger, he
prepared a treatment of the genus Aspleniwm in Venezuela, based
largely on the extensive collections assembled from the Guayana High-
lands region by the New York Botanical Garden and the Chicago
Natural History Museum.

In August, on his way to the AIBS meetings in Amherst, Mass.,
Dr. Mason E. Hale, curator of cryptogams, collected lichens in north-
western New Jersey, in the Catskill Mountains in New York, and in
46 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

western Connecticut. During September and October he visited
major herbaria in London, Stockholm, Uppsala, Lund, Turku, Hel-
sinki, Leiden, Vienna, Munich, and Geneva. One of the purposes
of the trip was to subject type specimens to chemical tests. In April
Dr. Hale collected in southwestern Virginia, North Carolina, eastern
Tennessee, Alabama, and Georgia, obtaining for chemical analysis
approximately 1,000 specimens at 27 localities.

Associate curator of cryptogams Harold E. Robinson spent 3
months, from the end of January to the end of April in Dominica,
as a participant in the Bredin-Archbold-Smithsonian biological sur-
vey of that island. Collections were made of both plant and animal
material, including primarily bryophytes, with approximately 200
species, and Dolichopodidae, with approximately 90 species.

Associate curator of cryptogams Paul Conger completed a manu-
script on a new species of epibenthic marine diatom from Honolulu
Harbor, Hawaii.

Before resigning in August, associate curator Richard E. Norris
completed a second cruise on the R/V Anton Bruun in the Indian
Ocean and made a collection of marine algae and plankton, which
is being processed at the Smithsonian Oceanographic Sorting Center.

Dr. William L. Stern, curator of plant anatomy, was transferred
temporarily to the International Civil Service early in July so that
he could spend a year in the Philippines as a forestry officer with the
Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations.

On August 25, Dr. Richard H. Eyde, associate curator of plant
anatomy, took part in an AIBS pre-meeting botanical field trip
through the Berkshire Mountains. He also spent a long weekend in
April visiting the Brookgreen Gardens in South Carolina for the
purpose of obtaining preserved flowers of Vyssa aquatica, a species
which does not grow in the Washington area. He arranged for ad-
ditional flowers to be collected as they appear.

Dr. Eyde completed a comparative anatomical investigation of the
flower Garrya, an American genus of debated affinities, concluding
that the closest allies are the Old World cornaceous genera Aucuba
and Griselina.

Dr. G. A. Cooper, chairman of the department of paleobiology, in
company with Dr. J. T. Dutro of the U.S. Geological Survey, made a
field trip to New Mexico and Texas from mid-March to the latter
part of April. They worked on the Devonian sequence in New Mexico,
first at Silver City, and then at Hillsboro, Mud Springs and Caballos
Mountains, and Alamogordo (San Andres and Sacramento Moun-
tains). In Texas they collected blocks of fossil-bearing Permian
rocks in the Guadalupe and Glass Mountains. Lastly, they col-
lected Permian and Pennsylvanian fossils in the vicinity of Santa
Anna and Jacksboro, Tex.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 47

In collaboration with Dr. R. E. Grant of the U.S. Geological Survey,
Dr. Cooper nearly finished a large manuscript on the Permian brachio-
pods of the Glass Mountains.

Dr. Francis Hueber, associate curator of paleobotany, made two
trips to Canada this year in connection with his study of fossil plants.
On the first trip, in August, he studied sites in Lower Devonian sedi-
ments along the shore of the Restigouche River in New Brunswick
and type localities for certain species along the north shore of Gaspé
Bay in Quebec. Sixteen crates of specimens were forwarded to
the museum. His second trip, in May, took him to the Redpath Mu-
seum at McGill University, Montreal, and to the Geological Survey
of Canada, Ottawa, to examine collections. One of his findings during
the second trip is that the holotype of Cladoxylon dawsoni, an Upper
Devonian plant from New York, is distributed among three separate
museum collections.

Dr. Hueber spent the first week in April in Scotland examining
collections of Rhynie Chert offered for sale. This is a classic Middle
Devonian plant-bearing material no longer freely available from the
type locality in Aberdeenshire. It contains exceptionally well-
preserved and nearly intact examples of early land plants, the dis-
covery and description of which in 1917-21 revolutionized botanical
evolutionary thought. Thus the opportunity to select this material
in quantity is quite rare. The lot purchased weighed 1,000 pounds.

Curator of invertebrate paleontology Richard S. Boardman, ac-
companied by museum specialist George T. Farmer, made a collecting
trip to the Arbuckle Mountains in southern Oklahoma in September
and October. The oldest known (approximately 480 million years)
fossil Bryozoa on the continent occur here in sedimentary rocks 1,500
feet thick. Thus, enough time is represented to demonstrate the
evolution of early genera and the phylogenetic connections and origin
of many of the genera occurring more commonly in younger rocks.

Dr. Porter Kier, associate curator of invertebrate paleontology,
was in Florida at the beginning of the fiscal year and continued there
until July 12 studying the living habits of echinoids in the area of
the Florida Keys. In company with Dr. Norman Sohl of the U.S.
Geological Survey, he used scuna diving equipment to observe species
distribution in relation to bottom conditions and depth. In April he
transferred these investigations to Dominica as part of the Bredin-
Archbold-Smithsonian biological survey of that island. Museum in-
vestigations enabled Dr. Kier to complete a major study of the
evolutionary trends in Paleozoic echinoids.

Associate curator of invertebrate paleontology Richard Cifelli com-
pleted a paper on planktonic Foraminifera from the western Atlantic

and another on concentration techniques of shelled organisms from
plankton.
48 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

Associate curator of invertebrate paleontology Erle G. Kauffman
and museum technician G. R. Paulson were in northern New Mexico
at the beginning of the fiscal year, measuring sections and collecting
mollusks from typically early Upper Cretaceous rocks. Shortly there-
after they extended the work into Colorado until the end of July.
Approximately 4,000 specimens were obtained from 21 stratigraphic
sections measured and collected. The data will permit revision of the
Coloradoan stratigraphy in many areas of northern New Mexico and
central Colorado, formation of a refined faunal zonation throughout
the region, and precise correlation of the sequence across the Front
Range of the Rocky Mountains.

Dr. Kauffman, accompanied by Dr. N. F. Sohl of the U.S. Geologi-
eal Survey, spent the last half of March in Puerto Rico studying the
Cretaceous biostratigraphy of the island and collecting invertebrate
fossils. All major Cretaceous localities in southwest Puerto Rico, and
along the central cordillera, were visited during the course of the work.
Approximately 214 tons of fossil material were collected, predomi-
nantly limestone blocks containing silicified mollusks, corals, sponges,
and other invertebrates. These collections, added to those obtained
previously by Survey personnel, form the largest and most diverse as-
semblage of invertebrate fossils from the Caribbean Cretaceous.

Dr. Martin A. Buzas, who joined the staff late last year as associate
curator of invertebrate paleontology, completed manuscripts on the
Foraminifera from a late Pleistocene clay near Waterford, Maine, and
a distributional study of the species of Foraminifera in Long Island
Sound.

Dr. C. L. Gazin, curator of vertebrate paleontology, accompanied
by Franklin L. Pearce, chief of the laboratory of vertebrate paleontol-
ogy, began exploration of the Middle Eocene Bridger formation of
southwestern Wyoming at the beginning of the fiscal year. Unfortu-
nately, at the end of the first week Mr. Pearce became ill and had to
return to Washington for hospitalization. Dr. Gazin continued alone
until early August. He devoted much time to a careful search for
smaller mammals in the upper part of the formation, as exposed in the
upper basin of Sage Creek, with some attention to the lower levels in
the Grizzly Buttes and to the north of Cedar Mountain. He also
made occasional profitable trips to localities of earlier years in the
Paleocene and Early Eocene of adjacent basins. At the close of the
year Dr. Gazin and Mr. Pearce were engaged in another field trip to
New Mexico and Wyoming.

Dr. Gazin completed his morphologic study of the Early Eocene
condylarthran mammal Minicotheriwm. This includes a detailed
review of nearly the entire skeleton, which is compared with that
of other condylarths, of which Hyopsodus provides much new
information.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 49

From the beginning of September to mid-October associate curator
of vertebrate paleontology D. H. Dunkle, accompanied by museum
technician G. B. Sullivan, conducted field work in northwestern
Ohio, in the area around Council Bluffs, Iowa, and in the Manzano
Mountains of central New Mexico. The 370 specimens collected and
the stratigraphic observations made will permit important additions
and revisions of the known paleoichthyological faunas of the Middle
Devonian silica shale of Ohio and several Late Paleozoic horizons
of the midcontinent and Rocky Mountain regions. The New Mexico
occurrence investigated is of especial interest; it is practically the one
known source in North America of a varied marine assemblage of
well-preserved fishes, invertebrates, and plants of the Permo-Carbon-
iferous interval.

In September associate curator of vertebrate paleontology Nicholas
Hotton III left Washington for field work in Africa. In addition to
collecting in the Permo-Triassic beds of the Karroo region of South
Africa, which has yielded a variety of mammal-like reptiles, he carried
on during a greater part of the year a detailed stratigraphic study of
the Beaufort series with a view toward a better understanding of the
distribution and ecology of the forms. At the end of the year he had
left Africa for Europe to study at certain of the leading museums.

On December 18, 1963, Dr. Clayton E. Ray joined the staff as asso-
ciate curator of vertebrate paleontology. During the next few
months, in continuation of his studies of fossil and modern terrestrial
vertebrates, especially rodents, of the Antillean region, he completed
reports on a new species of capromyid rodent and an undescribed
miniature ground sloth, both from a cave in the Dominican Republic.
From mid-May to the latter part of June he conducted a field investi-
gation of Pleistocene occurrences in the vicinity of Puebla, Mexico, in
collaboration with an archeological party from the Peabody Museum
in Cambridge, Mass.

On three occasions during the year Dr. Remington Kellogg, honor-
ary research associate, made day-long trips to the Chesapeake Bay
area, In company with one or more members of the staff, to inspect ex-
posed remains of Miocene vertebrates. The trip in July to Parker
Creek, Calvert County, Md., yielded a good part of the skeleton of a
Miocene cetothere (AMesocitus cephunculus) which is especially use-
ful to Dr. Kellogg in connection with studies now in progress on this
group of extinct whalebone whales. The trip to King George, Va., in
May revealed a shoreline concentration of mixed and abraded por-
poise and sea-cow bones and a variety of shark teeth. Inland occur-
rences such as this are only rarely encountered, and the distribution
record is of interest. In the course of the year Dr. Kellogg completed
a report on the skeleton of one of the larger Calvert Miocene whale-
bone whales.
50 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

Chairman George Switzer of the department of mineral sciences
completed his annual review of the diamond industry and, with ana-
lytical chemist Roy S. Clarke, Jr., et al., completed a manuscript on
“Fluorine in Hambergite.”

Dr. Paul E. Desautels, associate curator of mineral sciences, com-
pleted a study of one of the rare uranium minerals known as
“sklodowskite,” a hydrous magnesium uranyl silicate, from a new
locality in Mexico.

At the beginning of the year associate curator of mineral sciences
Dr. E. P. Henderson was in Australia prospecting for meteorites and
tektites. He continued working there until October, in company with
Dr. Brian Mason of the American Museum of Natural History, New
York, and Dr. R. V. Chalmers of the Australian Museum. They
collected meteorite material from four well-known Australian craters,
Henbury, Boxhole, Wolf Creek, and Dalgarange; relocated the Dal-
gety Downs meteorite and recovered nearly 500 pounds of material;
and collected many fine tektite specimens. Exchanges arranged dur-
ing the stay in Australia, and on the return trip through the Middle
East and Europe, added a number of fine new specimens to the collec-
tions. At the close of the year Dr. Henderson was back in Australia
on another prospecting trip.

Dr. Henderson completed two manuscripts: one, a study of the
hexahedrite meteorite groups, and the other, a discussion of the legend-
ary and probably nonexistent Port Orford, Oreg., meteorite. He also
completed a metallographic study of the Bogou, Upper Volta, iron
meteorite.

Analytical chemist Roy S. Clarke, Jr., in cooperation with R. J.
Gettens and E. W. FitzHugh of the Freer Gallery of Art, investigated
an iron-oxide corrosion product of a metal blade in the Gallery’s col-
lection and proved that it was fabricated from meteoritic iron. He
also completed chemical analysis of the mineral “phosphyllite” from
Bolivia.

Silvio A. Bedini, curator of mechanical and civil engineering of the
Museum of History and Technology, toured technical museums and
other institutions of learning in Great Britain and on the continent,
presenting lectures at the Astrophysical Observatory in Arcetri and
at the Instituto Nazionale della Ottica in Florence. Later, in collab-
oration with Francis R. Maddison of the Museum of the History of
Science at Oxford University, he completed a book on the de Dondi
astrarium entitled “Mechanical Universe.” Mr. Bedini completed
three more articles about antique science instruments in the national
collections; also articles on the invention of the orrery (including
study of an unrecorded instrument recently discovered in an Ameri-
can collection), on the evolution of science museums, and on early
SECRETARY’S REPORT 51

Italian science museums. In addition, he competed articles on Gali-
leo’s preoccupation with the measurement of time, on a comparison
of Galileo’s instruments, and on the craftsmen who produced the
instruments used by Galileo.

Associate curator Edwin A. Battison, assisted by summer intern
Bruce H. White, completed the first draft of a translation of Jacques
Besson’s Theatrum Instrumentarum et Machinarum from the 16th-
century French. This significant contribution to the history of
technology has not previously been available in English.

Curator of transportation Howard I. Chapelle made three trips to
Spain to inspect the reconstruction of Columbus’s Santa Maria being
produced by the Cardona Yard in Barcelona for exhibition at the
World’s Fair in New York, and to do research on Spanish shipbuild-
ing of the 18th and early 19th centuries.

Grace Rogers Cooper, curator of textiles, completed her monograph
on the Robertson and the Clark dolphin and cherub sewing machines
of the 1850’s. At the end of the year she was studying textiles at the
Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam, the Netherlands.

Paul V. Gardner, curator of ceramics and glass, visited 64 museums,
private collections, and glass factories in 11 European countries
between September and December, to evaluate the recently donated
Syz collection of 18th-century porcelains, to meet and confer with
collectors and museum personnel in the ceramic and glass field, and to
examine new exhibit techniques used in ceramic and glass displays.

Jacob Kainen, curator of graphic arts, made trips to Sarasota, Phil-
adelphia, and New York City for material relating to his study of the
Dutch engraver Hendrick Goltzius (1558-1617). He served as juror
for two art exhibitions: the 1963 All-Army Art Contest at Fort
George G. Meade, Md., and the 25th National Exhibition of the Soci-
ety of Washington Printmakers. He also had an exhibition of his
own paintings at the Roko Gallery in New York City.

On a trip to Europe, Eugene Ostroff, associate curator in charge of
the section of photography, visited museums, photographic equipment
factories, dealers, galleries, private collectors, and photographers for
the purpose of acquiring apparatus and prints for exhibits and of
establishing contacts for exchanges.

Peter C. Welsh, curator under the chairman of the department of
civil history, completed three manuscripts bearing the following titles:
“The Metallic Bench Plane: An American Contribution to Hand Tool
Design,” “Hand Tools as Decorative Objects,” and “Woodworking
Tools: 1600-1900.”

Assistant curator Doris Esch Borthwick completed a typescript of
the letters of Charles Wilkes, leader of the United States Exploring
Expedition.

Keith M. Melder, associate curator of political history, completed
a biographical sketch of Mrs. Josephine S. Griffing, a 19th-century
American reformer and feminist, and revised his manuscript on
“Bryan the Campaigner.”

The division of cultural history joined the Corning Museum of
Glass, serving as principal sponsor, in a second 10-day archeological
investigation of the site of John Frederick Amelung’s New Bremen
Glassworks, which operated between 1785 and 1795 in Frederick
County, Md. Ivor Noel Hume, research associate, was archeological
director, with Paul N. Perrot, director of the Corning Museum, as
administrative director. John N. Pearce, associate curator, and Rich-
ard J. Muzzrole, archeological aide, represented Smithsonian partici-
pation. The excavations revealed an astonishingly complex founda-
tion structure, evidence of a complete factory unit, having two fur-
naces, fritting areas, and the other appurtenances of a typically
Germanic glass-house of the 18th century. This archeological discov-
ery confirms documentary hints that Amelung’s enterprise was an
elaborate one. The project has thus become one of the most impor-
tant in industrial site archeology thus far undertaken in this country.

C. Malcolm Watkins, curator of cultural history, worked with Joan
Pearson Watkins, research collaborator, in recording by film and tape
the still living tradition of potterymaking practiced in Moore County,
N.C., since the second half of the 18th century. A photographic rec-
ord of all the processes used there in making a pot, from digging the
clay to firing the vessel, as well as tape-recorded interviews with the
area’s leading potter, were made this year.

Cynthia Adams Hoover, associate curator in charge of musical in-
struments, completed a paper on “The Slide Trumpet of the 19th
Century.”

Carl Scheele, associate curator of philately and postal history, com-
pleted an article which surveys the history of the division and traces
the development of its new exhibits.

At the beginning of the year, Dr. V. Clain-Stefanelli, curator of
numismatics, and Mrs. E. Clain-Stefanelli, associate curator, were in
Israel at the invitation of the Israeli Government. Dr. Stefanelli
traveled also in Greece, the Netherlands, Belgium, Germany, and
England, undertaking research on ancient, as well as United States,
coins in museums and private collections, and studying the history of
coining techniques. Mrs. Stefanelli studied ancient Greek coinage of
Messana at the British Museum, the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford,
the Fitzwilliam Museum in Cambridge, and the Penningkabinet in
The Hague.

Dr. Stefanelli completed research concerning a mission from Peru
to procure in Philadelphia modern equipment for the Lima mint, and
SECRETARY’S REPORT io

the striking in 1855, at the United States mint, of pattern coins for
Peru. Mrs. Stefanelli prepared for publication a select numismatic
bibliography comprising about 5,000 entries arranged in a topical
order.

In July and August, chairman of the department of Armed Forces
history Mendel L. Peterson, and museum specialist Alan B. Albright,
investigated two underwater sites in Bermuda through the cooperation
of E. B. Tucker of the Government of Bermuda. At the close of the
year Mr. Peterson was preparing for another diving season. He
finished work on a preliminary report on the marking and decoration
of muzzle-loading cannon.

Philip K. Lundeberg, curator of naval history, was awarded the
Moncado Prize of the American Military Institute for his publication
on “The German Naval Critique of the U-Boat Campaign, 1915-1918.”

Melvin H. Jackson, associate curator of naval history, in cooperation
with Howard I. Chapelle, completed a revision of plans of the schooner
Prince de Neufchatel preparatory to the construction of a model of
that handsome privateer. Dr. Jackson also completed a reassessment
of the battle of Negro Head in 1814, involving Revenue cutter Hage,
H.M. sloop Dispatch, and H.M. frigate Varcissus.

Alan B. Albright, museum specialist, completed a paper on the pres-
ervation of organic materials recovered from underwater sites.

EXHIBITIONS

A significant milestone in the history of the exhibits program at
the Smithsonian Institution was passed when the equivalent of 10
exhibit halls on the first and second floors of the Museum of History
and Technology were presented to the public on January 23, 1964.
These exhibition areas, totaling more than 75,000 square feet of attrac-
tive and instructive displays, include the Flag Hall, First Ladies Hall,
and the halls of Everyday Life in the American Past, American
Costume, Farm Machinery, Light Machinery, Tools, Vehicles, Rail-
roads, a portion of Heavy Machinery, the Greenough statue of George
Washington flanked by eight cases of outstanding national treasures,
the centrally located Foucault pendulum, and a temporary exhibition
which presents examples of exhibits to be installed in other halls of the
museum. This achievement was made possible through nearly 8 years
of advanced planning, design of exhibition halls, and design and pro-
duction of individual displays, some of which had been placed on tem-
porary exhibition in the Arts and Industries Building prior to their
installation in the new museum. It could not have been accomplished
without the contribution of knowledge and of talent by many individ-
uals on the curatorial staff, the Office of Exhibits, the Buildings Man-
agement Division, and private contractors.
54 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

Colorful new exhibits of objects from the Near East, Japan, Korea,
China, and North and West Africa were first placed on public view
when the west portion of the Hall of the Cultures of Asia and Africa
was informally opened in late June. Among the exhibits interpreting
the traditional cultures of the Asiatic peoples are a life-size group
portraying an episode from a Chinese opera, with accompanying push-
button sound recording, a display of objects illustrating the evolution
of farming in Japan, and a unit on the daily and religious life in Tibet.
The Republic of Korea has lent one of its national art treasures, a cast-
iron figure of Buddha from the Koryo dynasty (A.D. 935-1892), which
is presented in a temple setting with a paneled screen of red silk bro-
cade. North and West African cultures present many striking works
of art from peoples whose accomplishments have had a profound influ-
ence upon modern art in Europe and America. One of the most
dramatic displays is a diorama portraying the smelting of iron ore in
primitive furnaces and the fashioning of iron tools by tribesmen from
the Mandara Mountain region of the Northern Camaroons. This
miniature group was created by exhibits specialists John Weaver,
Robert Caffrey, and Peter De Anna. The exhibits in this hall were
planned by associate curators of ethnology Gordon R. Gibson and
Eugene Knez. The hall layout was made by exhibits designer Dorothy
Guthrie and the graphic design of individual units was executed by
exhibits designer Lucius Lomax.

The completely renovated life-size group portraying quarrying
operations and making of stone artifacts by Indians some 500 years
ago at the Piney Branch site, within the present boundaries of the
District of Columbia, was opened to the public in the Hall of North
American Archeology. Another life-group illustrating Indian copper
mining in present Michigan was nearing completion at year’s end.
Contract construction in the new Hall of Classical Archeology was
virtually completed at year’s end; the hall was designed by exhibits
designer Rolland O. Hower under the scientific supervision of asso-
ciate curator Gus Van Beek.

The construction contractor’s work in the new Hall of Physical
Anthropology also was nearing completion at the end of June. About
half of the exhibit units for this hall have been completed by exhibits
designer Joseph Shannon, who also served as architectural designer
for the hall. The contents of the exhibits have been specified by T.
Dale Stewart, director of the Museum of Natural History, and
Lawrence Angel, curator-in-charge of the Division of Physical
Anthropology.

During the spring of 1964, Dr. Knez supervised the exhibits instal-
lation of 41 outstanding examples of Chinese, Buddhist, and Hindu
stone sculpture, bronze, and other items from China, India, Cambodia,

SECRETARY'S REPORT 55

and Java, which were received from the Alien Property Office of the
Department of Justice. Dr. Van Beek worked with the Department
of State and the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Serv-
ice on arrangements for loan of the Dead Sea Scrolls and associated
materials from the Government of Jordan. In May, during an over-
seas detail, he conferred with officials of the Jordanian Government,
the United States Embassy, and the Palestine Archeological Museum
and selected specimens and photographs for use in the exhibition,
which is scheduled to be opened in the Museum of Natural History in
March 1965. Thereafter it will circulate for 6 months among other
museums in the United States under the Smithsonian Institution
Traveling Exhibition Service.

At the end of June the exhibits in the east of the half of the Hall of
Osteology, comprising the sections on mammals and birds, were infor-
mally opened to the public. The skeletons in this exhibition range in
size from one of the gray whale to those of small birds. Skeletal ma-
terials are supplemented by graphic portrayals of the appearance of
the particular examples displayed in the flesh. Among the many in-
teresting displays in the mammal section is one comparing the skeleton
of man with those of other Primates. In the section on birds a unit
points out the bony structure differences which serve as bases for
scientific classification of birds. The sections of this hall devoted to
reptiles, amphibians, and fishes are in process of preparation and in-
stallation. Planning of the exhibits in this hall has been coordinated
by David H. Johnson, curator-in-charge of the division of mammals,
with the cooperation of the staff members of all the divisions of this
department. Hall design was by Anthony Di Stefano and graphic
design by exhibits designer Morris M. Pearson.

On February 19, 1964, a temporary exhibition entitled “Return to
the Sea” was opened on the mezzanine of the Hall of Life in the Sea.
This display, a joint effort of the federal Interagency Committee of
Oceanography and the Smithsonian Institution, has as its theme the
renewal of interest in oceanography and the marine environment.

Associate curator Charles Cutress and Kjell Sandved spent approxi-
mately 2 months at Honolulu, Hawaii, Dillon Beach, Calif., and
Friday Harbor, Wash., obtaining photographs and well-preserved
specimens of animals of which models will be made for display in
additional permanent exhibits in this hall.

Preparation of models and the securing of specimens for the Hall of
Cold-blooded Vertebrates (fishes, amphibians, and reptiles) was con-
tinued during the year. Leonard P. Schultz, curator-in-charge of the
division of fishes, who is coordinating the planning of exhibits for this
hall, and Alfred Strohlein spent several days in the vicinity of Seattle,
Wash., during October collecting red salmon and background ma-
56 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

terials for the group on salmon spawning. Exhibits designer Barbara
Craig prepared the architectural layout for this hall. Graphic design
is by Joseph Shannon.

Planning for the Hall of Plant Life in the Museum of Natural
History has continued at an accelerated rate since January 1964.
At that time a planning committee was established consisting of
Assistant Director R. S. Cowan, chairman, and curators M. E.
Hale, Jr., T. R. Soderstrom, Stanwyn G. Shetler, Dan Nicolson, and
Richard H. Eyde. This group met regularly with exhibits designer
Rolland O. Hower to develop specific plans for the construction of
exhibits. Preliminary statements of the intent and content of each
unit are in preparation and a study model of a proposed organization
of exhibits in this large hall was prepared by Mr. Hower. In the
late spring three members of the committee visited localities in the
eastern part of the United States to select study sites in which to
obtain data for construction of some of the habitat groups. Prepara-
tion of botanical models for use in the exhibits in this hall was in
progress in the exhibits laboratory.

Planning and design of the new physical geology and meteorite ex-
hibits were completed in preparation for the beginning of construction
in this area in the summer of 1964. Additional space for the gem
exhibits will be provided in the same construction project. ‘The physi-
cal geology exhibit will interpret the nature and properties of materials
composing the earth, the distribution of materials throughout the
globe, the processes by which they are formed, altered, transported,
and distorted, and the nature and development of the landscape.
The new hall has been planned by curator-in-charge of the division
of mineralogy and petrology, George S. Switzer, and associate cura-
tors Paul E. Desautels and Edward P. Henderson. The hall layout
has been prepared by exhibits designers Dorothy Guthrie and Barbara
Craig.

The fourth and last of the remarkable series of mural paintings
in the Hall of the Age of Mammals in North America, representing
a Pliocene mammalian assemblage was completed in June by the
artist Jay H. Matternes.

Associate curator Clayton E. Ray initiated preliminary planning
of displays in the hall to be devoted to life of the Pleistocene, the
geologic epoch immediately preceding the present, in consultations
with members of the exhibit staff. Much of the time of the paleon-
tological laboratory staff was devoted to repairing and remounting
skeletons of the various larger Pleistocene mammals that were pre-
viously exhibited and in restoring new skeletal remains for presenta-
tion in this hall.

Four halls of the Department of Science and Technology in the east
SECRETARY’S REPORT 57

portion of the first floor were opened in January when the Museum
of History and Technology was opened to the public.

The Railroad Hall interprets the history of street railways, as
well as railroads, through a few choice full-scale vehicles and an
extended series of accurately and precisely executed scale models.
The giant 280-ton Pacific-type steam locomotive No. 1401, largest
and one of the most impressive 3-dimensional specimens in the
museum, stands near the row of east windows through which it may
be viewed from outside of the building at night, as well as by daylight.
A cut-away scale model of a Diesel-electric locomotive shows a type
that has supplanted the steam locomotive on American railroads in
recent years. A full-size cable car used in Seattle, Wash., at the
turn of the century stands on a section of narrow-gauge track in an
elevated position so that visitors can see the underground construc-
tion required for its operation. Basic developments in street cars,
locomotives, and railroad cars are illustrated by nearly 80 models, most
of them built to the same scale. The hall was planned by associate
curator John H. White, Jr., in collaboration with exhibits designers
James Mahoney, Virginia Mahoney, and Deborah Bretzfelder.

The adjacent Vehicle Hall traces the development of various types
of road vehicles in the United States from the 18th century to the
present day. Among the outstanding horse-drawn vehicles on dis-
play are two variations of the famous stagecoach, widely used in the
Kast and West beyond the lines of the early railroads; the finely con-
structed Lawrence family coach built in 1851; a city omnibus built by
EK. M. Miller of Quincy, Ill. The automobiles illustrate the rapid evo-
lution of automobile design and manufacture from the 1890’s. Along
with the Balzer and Haynes motor wagons appear the famous Winton
mile-a-minute racer of 1902, the Winton in which Dr. H. Nelson Jack-
son drove the first transcontinental motor trip in 1903, and a sturdy
Mack Bulldog truck. One of the very rare Draisines, known also as a
hobby horse, is shown in the cycle collection. Museum Specialist Don-
ald Berkebile planned the exhibits in this hall with assistance in lay-
out from exhibits designer Riddick Vann.

The Hall of Tools illustrates the history and development of ma-
chine tools. Introductory exhibits display hand tools with which
men performed laboriously the same tasks as were later accomplished
with much greater speed and precision by machine. A short sound
film in color describes the five basic machining operations—planing,
milling, drilling and boring, turning, and grinding. The attainment
of greater precision in measurement, important to the development
of machine tools, is emphasized in a series of exhibits tracing the
history of measurement from the Roman cubit to modern times. An
outstanding feature of this hall is a reconstructed full-size machine
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

shop of about 1855 equipped with some of the oldest machine tools
in the collection. Silvio Bedini, curator-in-charge of the division
of mechanical and civil engineering, and his predecessor, Eugene S.
Ferguson, selected the machines and planned the case exhibits in this
hall with the cooperation of exhibits designers Bright Springman,
Harry Hart, and John Clendening. William Henson installed the
machines and placed them in operating condition.

A major portion of the Hall of Light Machinery illustrates the
evolution of timekeeping. The introductory exhibit, through a
revolving globe bearing smal] sundials on its surface, demonstrates
the basic importance of the daily cycle of the earth’s rotation as the
foundation of man’s timekeeping systems. The series of timekeeping
exhibits illustrates the gradual developments from early sundials,
sandglasses, and waterclocks to the most precise modern electronic
clocks. In the center of the hall is a reconstruction of a Renaissance
clock tower, the four sides of which will display a sun dial and civil,
astronomical, and automation dials actuated by an American tower
clock of 1786. Both the sun dial and civil time dials have been in-
stalled, the former by museum specialist Dorothy Briggs and the lat-
ter by its maker, Thwaites & Reed of London, England. The exhibits
in other sections of this hall show machines derived from the skills
developed by clock and instrument makers. One series traces the
development of the phonograph from Thomas Edison’s original in-
vention through the work of Alexander Graham Bell’s Volta Labora-
tory and the more recent talking machines. Exhibits on the evolution
of the typewriter include early original machines and patent models.
Exhibits in this hall were planned by associate curator Edwin A.
Battison in cooperation with hall designer Bright Springman and
exhibits designer Barbara Bowes.

At the close of the year installation of exhibits in the Hall of Civil
Engineering was nearing completion. This hall interprets the story
of bridge- and tunnel-building through the ages. It shows how the
use of new materials enabled bridge builders to construct longer spans
and illustrates through scale models many of the classic bridges of
history. The tunnels section features a series of cut-away scale
models illustrating the development of methods in both soft-ground
and hard rock tunneling and depicting men at work constructing some
of the major tunnels in which new drilling methods and mechanisms
were employed. Associate curator Robert M. Vogel prepared the
technical specifications for this hall. Exhibits layout and design are
the work of exhibits designers John Brown and Harry Hart.

Considerable progress also was made in the design, production, and
installation of exhibits in the Hall of Heavy Machinery. Exhibits
interpreting the early development of the steam engine—including a
SECRETARY'S REPORT 59

reconstruction of the Watt engine—were opened to the public in Jan-
uary. It is planned to open the series of exhibits on refrigeration
and the Diesel engine when the adjoining Civil Engineering Hall is
opened in July 1964. Robert M. Vogel is responsible for planning
this hall’s contents. The layout and units designs have been prepared
by exhibits designer Harry Hart.

A considerable number of the scale models of historic types of
vessels from the museum’s outstanding watercraft collection have been
placed in free-standing exhibition cases in the American Merchant
Shipping Hall by exhibits specialists James A. Knowles, Jr., under the
supervision of Howard I. Chapelle, curator-in-charge of the division
of transportation.

A temporary exhibition of communications satellites is being in-
stalled in the Hall of Electricity; as a nucleus for this exhibit the
back-up satellite for 7’elstar 7—presented to the museum on July 10,
1963, the first anniversary of its launching—will be on view. Installa-
tion of cases for permanent exhibits which will interpret current-
electricity, was nearing completion at year’s end. These exhibits
have been planned by Bernard S. Finn, associate curator in charge
of the division of electricity. Exhibits designer Nadya Kayloff has
nearly completed the design on these displays.

In the Halls of Pharmacy, Medicine, and Dentistry installation
neared completion of an 1890-period drugstore, of period interiors
depicting a portion of a room in the Massachusetts General Hospital,
and a midwestern dentist’s office. The Old World Apothecary Shop,
formerly on view in the Arts and Industries Building, has been moved
and is being installed in the new Hall of Pharmacy. ‘Two new ex-
hibits destined for exhibition in the new museum were placed on
temporary display in the Arts and Industries Building. One depicts
in diorama form Dr. Philip S. Physick removing a large paratoid
gland tumor in the circular room of the Pennsylvania Hospital in
1805, long before the discovery of anesthesia. The other is an en-
larged model of the human ear donated by the Lambert Institute of
Otalogy of New York City. Dr. Sami K. Hamarneh, curator-in-
charge of medical sciences, assisted by Dr. Alfred R. Henderson, con-
sultant, are completing exhibit plans for the medical science exhibits,
in cooperation with John Clendening, exhibits designer.

The Foucault pendulum, prepared by the California Institute of
Technology and exhibited in the central rotunda of the new museum,
has fascinated visitors since the opening of the building. The divi-
sion of physical sciences, placed in charge of this exhibit, has been
making careful studies of its operation and of the problem of inter-
preting it to the public. A large graphic explanation has been
planned by Dr. Walter F. Cannon, curator-in-charge of the division,
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

which is being produced by the exhibits laboratory. Development of
exhibits for the Hall of Physical Sciences progressed with the com-
pletion of a layout plan for the mathematics section and the produc-
tion of all but one unit in the section on astronomy.

The Farm Machinery Hall was on view when the new Museum of
History and Technology building opened in January. Through dis-
plays of original objects and accurate scale models this hall shows how
the invention and use of labor-saving machines played a major role in
the rapid expansion of American agriculture since the early 19th
century. The earlier hand-wielded and horse-drawn implements are
contrasted with later self-propelled machines which performed the
same basic tasks of plowing, planting, cultivating, and harvesting food
crops. Thomas Jefferson’s plan for a more efficient moldboard which
any farmer of his time could make with his own tools and fit to his
plow is a feature display in the series on the development of the plow.
John Deere’s “steel” plow is shown, as are scale models of the MeCor-
mick and Hussey reapers of the 1830’s. Colorful portable steam
engines which supplied belted power to the old threshers and other
farm machines are displayed along with gasoline and diesel tractors
which pulled and powered large farm implements. The exhibits in
this hall were planned by associate curator Edward C. Kendall in
cooperation with exhibits designer Riddick Vann. The human figures
which help to establish scale and add interest to the miniature models
of reapers were executed by exhibits technician Susan Wallace.

Installation of exhibits in the new Hall of Graphic Arts was begun
in the spring of 1964 in anticipation of a fall opening. This hall will
explain the processes and present outstanding examples of graphic
works created and produced by hand and by photomechanical proc-
esses. These exhibits have been planned by curator-in-charge Jacob
Kainen and associate curator Fuller O. Griffith of the division of
graphic arts in cooperation with exhibits designer Nadya Kayaloff.

Among the displays in the preview of future exhibits in the tempo-
rary exhibits gallery on the first floor of the new museum are a num-
ber of outstanding objects from the collections of this department,
including the Benjamin Franklin Press, the Kelmscott Chaucer, three
prints of old masters, and an early American handloom, built by a
pioneer settler of western Pennsylvania about 1800. The loom was
prepared for weaving and is used for weekly demonstrations by asso-
ciate curator of textiles Rita Adrosko.

Miss Bowman, Mrs. Lois Vann, and Miss Maureen Collins of the
division of textiles assisted in preparing the backing of the Star-
Spangled Banner prior to its installation in the new museum. Miss
Collins also assisted Mrs. Murray in the preparation of specimens for
exhibition in the Hall of American Costume. Several textiles speci-

SECRETARY'S REPORT 61

mens were loaned to the American Museum in Britain, at Claverton
Manor near Bath, England.

A reproduction of the figure 8 stellerator developed by Dr. Lyman
Spitzer of Princeton University was placed on exhibition in the west
window area on the first floor of the new museum shortly before the
building was opened to the public. It is symbolic of the research in-
volving the generation of temperatures in excess of 100 million degrees
Centigrade.

Three of the four halls of the Department of Civil History were on
public view when the new museum opened in January. The fourth,
the Hall of Historic Americans, was formally opened to the public in
June.

The Hall of Everyday Life in the American Past, comprising the
largest exhibition gallery in the museum, displays the material evi-
dences of domestic life in America before 1900. The furnishings,
utensils, decorative arts, and other objects illustrating aspects of the
cultural life of the country are presented in a series of cases, period
rooms, and platform groupings progressing chronologically from an
initial series of displays devoted to the European backgrounds of early
settlement groups. Among the outstanding exhibits are a reproduc-
tion of a room from an 18th-century Spanish New Mexican adobe home
and objects of religious art from the Franciscan missions of the South-
west; displays ranging from artifacts obtained archeologically to fine
furniture, pewter, and silver of the English colonies of the eastern
seaboard, and an entire log house from Mill Creek Hundred, Del.,
dating from about 1740 showing both the exterior and interior con-
struction and the furnishings of this home. This hall was planned
and installed under the direction of C. Malcolm Watkins, curator-in-
charge, assisted by associate curators Rodris Roth and John N. Pearce
of the division of cultural history. It was designed by John E. Ang-
lim, exhibits chief, with the assistance of exhibits designer Deborah
Bretzfelder. Period rooms and the log house were executed by George
H. Watson and his staff of restoration specialists with the professional
assistance of Mrs. E. Boyd, curator of Spanish Colonial art, Museum
of New Mexico, and architects Robert L. Raley of Newark, Del., and
Robert E. Plettenberg of Santa Fe, N. Mex.

The new First Ladies Hall provides a more appealing medium for
continuing the Smithsonian Institution’s tradition of exhibiting the
dresses worn by the wife or official hostess of each President of the
United States. These dresses show the changes in American costume
from the 18th-century style worn by Martha Washington to the simple
lines and elegant fabrics of more recent First Ladies. The dresses
are displayed upon mannequins in a series of eight room settings, each
appropriately finished and furnished to indicate the periods and en-
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

vironments in which the dresses are worn. Two rooms reproduce
those in the house at 190 High Street in Philadelphia where President
and Mrs. Washington lived before the White House was built and
display furniture and fixtures owned and used by them. The other
room settings combine architectural details from the White House,
including four original White House mantels and the 1902 paneling
from the East Room, with furniture and accessories used both in the
White House and in Presidential family homes. This hall was devel-
oped by associate curator Margaret Brown Klapthor in cooperation
with exhibits chief Benjamin W. Lawless.

The new Hall of American Costume adequately presents for the
first time the Museum’s rich and extensive collection of men’s, wom-
en’s, and children’s clothing of the 18th, 19th, and 20th centuries.
It includes accessories of dress such as shoes, hats, handkerchiefs,
parasols, and gloves and such decorative accessories as fans, em-
broidered and beaded purses, and many fine examples of period
jewelry. Many of the clothing items are exhibited on mannequins
which portray the hair dress appropriate to the costumes, and some
are shown in groupings in partial room settings. Illustration of
various types of clothing selected from paintings and engravings
dealing with the history of costume supplements the original speci-
mens on display. The entire hall has been one of great interest for
historians, artists, and students of American style and taste. The
exhibits were planned and installed under the direction of assistant
curator Anne W. Murray. Hall design was by exhibits designer
Robert M. Widder; graphic design by exhibits designers Judith
Borgogni, Virginia Mahoney, and Deborah Bretzfelder.

The Hall of Historic Americans is unlike other museum presenta-
tions in the United States. A portion of the hall is devoted to a
capsule history of American political campaign techniques, tracing
their development from the era of genteel “parlor politics” to the
modern political use of the mass media of communications. A dra-
matic political parade illustrates the development of Presidential cam-
paigning between 1840 and 1930 with papier maché marchers carrying
authenic political banners, pennants, and torchlights and wearing
campaign clothing and badges. An adjoining area, illustrating the
important relationship between politics and the press, radio, and tele-
vision, includes microphones used by Franklin D. Roosevelt in de-
livering his historic fireside chats on radio and by Dwight D. Eisen-
hower in television broadcasts. Several exhibits display memorabilia
of distinguished families and individuals—the Washington and
Adams families, Ulysses S. Grant, and Abraham Lincoln. In one
of these a newly sculptured figure of Abraham Lincoln wearing the
business suit which he wore on the day of his assassination, stands

SECRETARY’S REPORT 63

in a setting which closely resembles that shown in several Mathew
Brady photographs of the President. Planning and installation of
the exhibits in this hall were under the direction of curator-in-charge
Wilcomb E. Washburn, assisted by associate curator Keith E. Melder
and assistant curator Herbert R. Collins of the division of political
history in association with exhibits designer Robert Widder. At the
forma] ceremonies opening the hall on the evening of June 29, fea-
tured speakers included the Honorable Frances P. Bolton, Member of
the House of Representatives from Ohio, and the Honorable Claiborne
Pell, United States Senator from Rhode Island.

Marked progress was made in the preparation of the Hall of
Philately and Postal History. During March several examples of
stamp production equipment were transported to the Museum and
moved into position in the stamp production alcove of this hall by
the Bureau of Printing and Engraving. The series of exhibits on the
history of the world’s posts were produced, exhibit cases for models
of vehicles used to transport the mails and for postage meter and
canceling machines were delivered to the hall, and the refinishing of
the pull-out frames which will exhibit by country and systematic
National Postage Stamp Collection was completed. This hall has been
planned by curator Carl H. Scheele with the assistance of museum
technician Francis E. Welch in collaboration with exhibits designer
John Clendening.

Associate curator of numismatics Elvira Clain-Stefanelli with the
assistance of the Medallic Art Co. and the United States Mint pre-
pared a display of contemporary United States medals for the Mu-
seum’s Hall of Monetary History and Medallic Art. A temporary
display illustrating the history of the traveler’s check, including James
C. Fargo’s announcement of 1891 initiating the issuance of traveler’s
checks by the American Express Co., was installed in February. On
March 27 a special exhibition of original mint models and designs for
the John F. Kennedy half dollar was placed on display through the
good offices of the Director of the Mint, Miss Eva Adams, and the
Superintendent of the Philadelphia Mint, Michael H. Sura. In April
a large display of the currencies of the Austrian Empire was installed,
employing material recently received from the Mortimer and Anna
Neinken Collection.

The Star-Spangled Banner, the original flag which flew over Fort
McHenry at Baltimore during the attack of the British fleet on Sep-
tember 13-14, 1814, and which inspired Francis Scott Key to write the
words of what is now our National Anthem, was installed in the new
Museum of History and Technology when it was opened to the public
in January. Although this most important museum object related to
the history of the United States had been exhibited in the Arts and
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

Industries Building since it was presented to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution in 1912, it is now displayed for the first time at full length,
undraped, and in a place of honor befitting its importance as a na-
tional symbol. The flag is displayed over a supporting fabric large
enough to indicate its original dimensions of 30 by 42 feet and com-
pletely covers a specially designed metal grid which holds the flag
and its supporting fabric in a vertical position and hangs in an atmos-
phere of filtered air carefully controlled for the proper temperature
and humidity. The flag was prepared for exhibition and installed
under the direction of Edgar M. Howell, curator-in-charge of the
division of military history, with the assistance of Grace Rogers
Cooper, curator-in-charge, division of textiles. The setting for the
flag was designed by Walker Cain of the firm of Steinmann, Cain &
White, architects for the new Museum. The cased exhibit was de-
signed by Robert Widder, exhibits designer.

The entire professional staff of the department has been deeply
concerned with the development of exhibits for the Armed Forces his-
tory halls in the new Museum. The exhibit of Armed Forces history
in the Arts and Industries Building will remain until the early fall
of 1964.

Assistant director John C. Ewers coordinated the varied exhibits
activities of the Museum of History and Technology, with the able
assistance of John N. Edy who planned the physical movement of
materials. Benjamin W. Lawless continued to supervise the design,
production, and installation of exhibits, aided by Robert Widder in
design, Bela S. Bory and William Clark in production, Robert
Klinger in the model shop, Stanley Santoroski in supervision of
installation, and Carroll Lusk, lighting specialist. Editing of the
curators’ drafts of exhibits scripts was continued by George Weiner,
assisted by Constance Minkin and Edna Wright. The timely assist-
ance of buildings manager Andrew F. Michaels and his staff contrib-
uted substantially to the success of this program, as did the services
of John E. Cudd, liaison architect, and George Watson, skilled special-
ist in the renovation and installation of period interiors.

John E, Anglin, exhibits chief, continued in charge of the planning
and preparation of all exhibits and directly supervised the operation
of the exhibits laboratory in the Natural History Building, with the
assistance of Gilbert Wright. Julius Tretick supervised the produc-
tion and installation of natural history exhibits. Substantial portions
of the Hall of the Cultures of Asia and Africa and the Hall of Oste-
ology in the Museum of Natural History were opened to the public
in June and progress was made on hall layout and/or exhibits design
in five other galleries in that building. Director T. Dale Stewart
continued to serve as chairman of the committee coordinating the
SECRETARY’S REPORT 65

exhibits modernization program in natural history, and assistant di-
rector Richard S. Cowan was responsible for integrating the work
of curators and exhibits personnel in the development of natural-
history exhibits.

DOCENT SERVICE

The Junior League of Washington conducted its volunteer guide
program for the school classes of the greater Washington area through
the Smithsonian museums for the tenth consecutive year. The pro-
gram was carried out through the cooperation of G. Carroll Lindsay,
curator of the Smithsonian Museum Service, with Mrs. Dickson R.
Loos as chairman of the League’s guide service and Mrs. Arncld B.
McKinnon as cochairman. Mrs. McKinnon will serve as chairman
for the forthcoming year with Mrs. Joseph Smith, Jr., as cochairman.

During the 1963-64 school year 20,044 children were conducted on
701 tours. During the year, the 100,000th child to participate in the
program was conducted on a tour by the volunteers.

Tours were conducted in the Halls of Mammals, Native Peoples of
the Americas, and Textiles for grades 3 through 6; and in the Halls
of Gems and Minerals and Prehistoric Life for grades 5 through junior
high. The Prehistoric Life tour was given for the first time this
year. The Power Hall, in which tours had been conducted for the
past 6 years, was closed to tours because of its move to the Museum
of History and Technology. Since the beginning of Power Hall
tours in 1958, about 12,000 children have been conducted through this
hall.

Tours were offered 5 days a week, four tours each day, every half
hour beginning at 10:00 a.m. through 11:30 a.m. in the Halls of Mam-
mals and Native Peoples of the Americas. Tours in the Halls of Gems
and Minerals and Prehistoric Life were offered Monday through
Friday at 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 am. The textile tour was offered
only on Wednesdays and Fridays at 10:00 a.m. and 11:00 a.m.

Tours were conducted from October 2 through May 29, with the
exception of the month of April 1964, when, as usual, tours were
suspended because of the exceedingly heavy visitor traffic in all
museum halls during the Easter and cherry-blossom seasons. During
May, for the first time, the volunteers made use of compact, portable
amplifiers. With the aid of these amplifiers it is possible to conduct
tours even when the exhibit halls are heavily crowded.

In addition to Mrs. Loos and Mrs. McKinnon, the members of the
League’s guided tour committee were:

Mrs. Timothy Atkeson, Mrs. Leon Bernstein, Mrs. Thomas A. Bradford, Jr.,
Mrs. Challen E. Caskie, Mrs. Thomas R. Cate, Mrs. F. David Clarke, Mrs. Steven

Conger, Mrs. Henry M. deButts, Mrs. Lee M. Folger, Mrs. Rockwood Foster, Mrs.
George Gerber, Mrs. Gilbert Grosvenor, Mrs. James Harvey, Mrs. William
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

Henry, Mrs. Walter M. Johnson, Jr., Mrs. Vernon Knight, Mrs. Lansing Lamont,
Mrs. Edward Leonard, Mrs. John Manfuso, Jr., Mrs. H. Roemer McPhee, Mrs.
R. Kendall Nottingham, Mrs. L. Edgar Prina, Mrs. W. James Sears, Mrs. Walter
Slowinski, Mrs. Joseph Smith, Jr., Mrs. James H. Stallings, Jr., Mrs. Edwin F.
Stetson, Mrs. E. Tilman Stirling, Mrs. John 8. Vorhees, Mrs. Richard Wallis,
and Mrs. Mark White.

The Institution deeply appreciates the able and devoted efforts of
these volunteers, whose services to the schools of the Washington area
encourage effective use of Smithsonian museum exhibits by teachers
and students.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

The contract for the construction of the west wing of the Natural
History Building, including the last stage of renovation of the original
building, was signed in August 1963. Excavation for the wing was
begun in November and, owing to a mild winter, the foundations were
laid and the superstructure erected at a rapid rate. By the end of the
fiscal year most of the granite facing was in place.

Within the original building a large L-shaped area in the northwest
corner of the third floor was cleared for renovation by October. Work
in this area proceeded slowly, owing to the need for preliminary in-
stallation of electrical conduits. This area was still not finished by
the end of the fiscal year, but work was proceeding at a faster pace.

The General Services Administration accepted all remaining areas
and systems of the Museum of History and Technology, not previously
accepted, effective August 30, 1963, with certain exceptions.

President Lyndon B. Johnson dedicated the building at ceremonies
held in the evening of January 22, 1964. The Museum was opened to
the public at 9:00 a.m., January 23, 1964. The Museum has been
visited by record-breaking crowds and has become the focus of the
attention of scholars, university departments, and museum profes-
sionals, who are interested by the impact which the scholarly staff and
great collections of the Smithsonian can have on education at all
levels from the elementary student to the postgraduate.

CHANGES IN ORGANIZATION AND STAFF

Approval for the establishment of a Department of Entomology
was given by former Secretary Leonard Carmichael on April 380, 1963.
Accordingly, on July 1, 1963, the division of insects was separated
from the Department of Zoology and became the Department of
Entomolgy. The five divisions in the department are: Neuropteroids,
Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, Myriapoda and Arachnida, and Hemiptera.?

2For administrative purposes, and until new divisions are established in the new
Department of Entomology, the newly created units will deal with subject matters not
necessarily closely related; the division of neuropteroids will handle administrative
matters pertaining to the Orthoptera and Isoptera; the division of Lepidoptera will

handle Diptera; the division of Hemiptera will process transactions involving Hymenop-
tera.

SECRETARY’S REPORT 67

Likewise, a plan to divide the Department of Geology into two depart-
ments, Mineral Sciences and Paleobiology, was approved on August
20, 1963, and the reorganization became effective on October 15, 1963.
The diversity of disciplines in the old geology department made the
partition logical and desirable. The purely physical subjects of
mineralogy, petrology, and meteoritics are now separated from the
biological subjects of paleontology and ecology. The Department of
Mineral Sciences consists of three divisions, Mineralogy, Meteorites,
and Petrology. The Department of Paleobiology consists of four
divisions: Invertebrate Paleontology, Vertebrate Paleontology, Paleo-
botany, and Sedimentology.

By direction of the Secretary, a new system was inaugurated in May
whereby certain administrative duties within the Museu are rotated
in order to free senior staff members for research and publication,
permitting others to participate more widely in administration. While
it is believed that it is at the department level that such moves are
most needed, the designation of more than one full curator within a
division will make it possible to rotate appointments in the divisions
as well. This will be done by detailing a member of the division
curatorial staff to serve as “curator in charge.” The curator formerly
in charge of that division will either become a senior scientist or his-
torian or continue on the personnel rolls as a full curator. Such
rotations may be scheduled by museum directors in response to recog-
nized needs, although they will not become a matter of set schedule
or routine. The title “head curator” has accordingly been discon-
tinued, and the title for the administrative head of each department
will be “chairman.” The former chairman of a department may be
appointed a senior scientist or continue to serve as a full curator,
upon the recommendation of his Museum director.

During fiscal year 1964 the following appointments were made to
the scientific staff of the Museum of Natural History: Dr. Wallace R.
Ernst, associate curator of phanerogams, on July 29, 1963; David B.
Lellinger, associate curator of ferns, on August 26, 1963; Dr. Richard
C. Froeschner, associate curator in charge of Hemiptera, on August
26, 1963; Dr. Richard L. Zusi, associate curator of birds, on September
8, 1963; Dr. Richard B. Woodbury, associate curator of archeology, on
December 15, 1963; Dr. Clayton E. Ray, associate curator of vertebrate
paleontology, on December 18, 1963; Dr. Dan H. Nicolson, associate
curator of phanerogams, on January 5, 1964; Dr. David L. Pawson, as-
sociate curator of marine erpeste beater. on ee 20, 1964; Dr. Walter H.
Adey, associate curator of paleobotany, on June 30, 1964; and Dr.
Richard H. Benson, associate curator of invertebrate palentology,
on June 30, 1964.

Among the additions to the staff of the Museum of History and

7166-74665 6
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

Technology were the appointments of Miss Deborah J. Mills, assistant
curator in the chairman’s office, Department of Science and Technol-
ogy, on July 16, 1963; Miss Rita J. Adrosko, associate curator in the di-
vision of textiles, Department of Arts and Manufactures, on August 4,
1963; Miss Anne Castrodale, assistant curator, growth of the United
States, Department of Civil History, on September 29, 1963; and Miss
Uta C. Merzbach, associate curator, division of physical sciences, De-
partment of Science and Technology, on October 28, 1963.

Mrs. Agnes Chase, world-famous agrostologist and Smithsonian
honorary research associate, died on September 24, 1963.

Francis J. McCall, curator of the division of philately and postal
history, died on July 20, 1963. He had headed the division since No-
vember 6, 1962, and had just begun to see the results of some of the
fine programs he had inaugurated.

Miss Ellen Joy Finnegan, assistant curator in the section of
growth of the United States, left the Museum of History and Tech-
nology on August 14, 1963, to accept a teaching position in Thailand.

Report on the International Exchange
Service

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the International Exchange Service for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 1964:

The original plan of organization of the Smithsonian Institution
presented to the Board of Regents by Joseph Henry in 1847 pro-
vided for a system of exchange of current publications which would
afford the Smithsonian Institution the most ready means of entering
into friendly relations and correspondence with all the learned so-
cieties in the world and of enriching the Smithsonian library with the
current transactions and proceedings of foreign institutions.

When the first of the Smithsonian’s long series of scientific publi-
cations, Ancient Monuments of the Mississippi Valley, was issued,
copies were sent to scientific and learned institutions abroad. In re-
turn, the Smithsonian Institution received many valuable publica-
tions from foreign institutions. To continue this desirable interna-
tional exchange of scientific information, the Smithsonian Institution
appointed agents in a number of foreign countries to distribute the
publications received from the Smithsonian Institution and to forward
to the Smithsonian Institution the publications received from the
foreign institutions.

In 1851 the privilege of transmitting scientific, cultural, and literary
publications through the Smithsonian Institution to other countries,
and of receiving similar publications from foreign institutions in
return, was extended to Government agencies and a number of scien-
tific societies in the United States. This opportunity to distribute
their publications abroad was eagerly accepted and the system grew
so rapidly that today most Government agencies, many universities,
and scientific organizations representing every State in the Union
utilize the International Exchange Service. The International Ex-
change Service functions as a medium for developing and executing
in part the broad and comprehensive objective of the Smithsonian
Institution—“the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.”
This service has grown from a few hundred packages of publications
transmitted per year to more than a million packages during the past
fiscal year.

70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

Publications weighing 891,148 pounds were received during the year
from Government bureaus and departments, congressional committees,
members of Congress, universities, agricultural experiment stations,
learned societies, scientific organizations, and individuals for trans-
mission to addressees in more than 100 different countries. Repre-
sentative of these publications are the following: Language, Journal
of the Linguistic Society of America; Journal of the National Educa-
tion Association; Journal of Science; Yale University Bulletin; Year-
book of the Carnegie Institution; Zoologica; Transactions of the
American Association of Physicians; Expedition; Brevoria; Oregon
Law Review; Museum of Art Register; Paleontological Contribu-
tions; Anthropological Record; Novitates; Proceedings of the Ameri-
can Philosophical Society; Contributions of the Scripps Institution of
Oceanography; and Proceedings of the California Academy of
Sciences.

Publications are accepted for transmission to addressees in all coun-
tries except to the mainland of China, North Korea, and Communist-
controlled areas of Viet-Nam. Packages of publications from domes-
tic sources intended for addressees in the United States or in a terri-
tory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States are not accepted
for transmission.

During the fiscal year 1964, the International Exchange Service
received for transmission publications weighing over 1 million pounds
from foreign and domestic sources—the largest amount of publica-
tions received for transmission during any one year by the Service.
The number and weight of the packages of publications received from
sources in the United States for transmission abroad, and the number
and weight of packages received from foreign sources intended for
domestic addresses, are classified for fiscal 1964 in table 1.

Publications weighing 118,091 pounds were received during the year
from foreign sources for distribution to addresses in the United States.

Publications weighing 621,353 pounds, 69.7 percent of the total re-
ceived for transmission abroad, were forwarded by ocean freight at
a cost to the Smithsonian Institution of $36,187 or approximately 5.8
cents per pound.

Packages of publications are mailed directly to the addresses in the
countries that do not have exchange bureaus. During the past fiscal
year publications weighing 269,773 pounds, 30.3 percent of the total
received for transmission abroad, were mailed to the intended ad-
dresses, at a cost of $63,073 or approximately 23.4 cents per pound.

Report on the Bureau of American

Ethnology

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the field
researches, office work, and other operations of the Bureau of American
Ethnology during the fiscal year ended June 30, 1964, conducted in
accordance with the act of Congress of April 10, 1928, as amended
August 22, 1949, which directs the Bureau “to continue independently
or in cooperation anthropological researches among the American
Indians and the natives of lands under the jurisdiction or protection
of the United States and the excavation and preservation of archeo-

logic remains.”
SYSTEMATIC RESEARCHES

Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., devoted most of the first quarter of
the fiscal year to office duties and to general supervision of the activities
of the Bureau and the River Basin Surveys. In mid-October he went
on extended sick leave and retired on June 5, 1964, after 37 years 10
months of service. During his absence from the office and the period
from his retirement to the end of the fiscal year, Dr. Henry B. Collins
assumed administrative responsibility for the Bureau as acting direc-
tor, and Dr. Robert L. Stephenson functioned in a similar capacity
for the River Basin Surveys.

In August, Dr. Henry B. Collins, anthropologist, made a trip to
L’Anse aux Meadows, northern Newfoundland, on behalf of the
National Geographic Society, to check the authenticity of an archeo-
logical site which its discoverer, Helge Ingstad, of Oslo, Norway,
believed to be of Norse origin. As a result of his examination of
the site, Dr. Collins was able to verify this conclusion. The ruins of
sod-walled houses excavated by Mr. Ingstad at L’Anse aux Meadows
are definitely not Indian or Eskimo, and there is nothing to indicate
that they were the work of later English, French, or Portuguese
fishermen. On the other hand, the house ruins and associated features
are closely similar to those found at Viking sites in Greenland and
Iceland. Thirteen radiocarbon dates, based on charcoal from the
house ruins, cluster around the year A.D. 1000. This is the period
of the Vinland voyages, when, according to the sagas, Leif Ericson,
Thorfinn Karlsefni, and other Norsemen sailed westward and dis-
covered the American mainland.

SECRETARY’S REPORT 81

Dr. Collins continued to serve as a member of the board of gover-
nors of the Arctic Institute of North America, as a member of its
publications committee and as chairman of the committees directing
two of the Arctic Institute’s projects—a Russian translation program
and the Arctic Bibliography. The latter is a comprehensive reference
work which abstracts and indexes in English the contents of publica-
tions in all languages and in all fields of science pertaining to the
Arctic and subarctic regions of the world. This work, which is sup-
ported by a number of military and civilian agencies of the United
States and Canada, began operating in 1947, and to date has published
11 large volumes containing abstracts of 69,455 scientific publications
on the Arctic. The other Arctic Institute project being carried out
under Dr. Collins’ direction, Anthropology of the North: Translations
from Russian Sources, continued its operations under a renewed grant
from the National Science Foundation. The latest volume in the
translatien series, Studies in Siberian Shamanism, edited by Dr.
Henry N. Michael, was published by the University of Toronto Press
in December 1963.

Dr. Robert L. Stephenson was transferred on September 29, 1963,
from chief of the Missouri Basin Project, River Basin Surveys, Lin-
coln, Nebr., to the regular staff of the Bureau of American Ethnology
as assistant director of the River Basin Surveys. He has devoted
his time to familiarizing himself with the activities of the Washington
headquarters of the River Basin Surveys, to the general supervision of
that unit, and to sorting materials and writing his reports on past
field researches. In November he attended the Southeastern Archeo-
logical Conference in Macon, Ga. He spent the period November 29
to December 5 in Lincoln, Nebr., consulting with representatives of
the National Park Service and State cooperative agencies on research
plans for the River Basin Surveys for the coming year. On February
12-13 he participated in the annual meeting of the Committee for the
Recovery of Archeological Remains, in Washington, D.C., and de-
tailed the program of systematic researches of the River Basin Sur-
veys. During May 7-9 he attended the annual meeting of the Society
for American Archeology at Chapel Hill, N.C. On May 10 he was
the featured speaker at the semiannual meeting of the Maryland
Archeological Society in Washington, D.C., and presented an illus-
trated lecture on the “Archeology of the Middle Atlantic Seaboard
Area.”

During the early part of the fiscal year, Dr. William C, Sturtevant,
ethnologist, was engaged in completing his paper on “Studies in
Ethnoscience” (still in press at the end of the year) and in preparing
for a year’s field work in Burma. In July he flew to Gainesville, Fla.,
to work with Dr. Irving Rouse, of Yale University, and Dr. Charles
82 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

H. Fairbanks, of the University of Florida, on projects concerning
the editing of the obituary and collected writings of the late Dr. John
W. Goggin. He also advised the University’s Department of Anthro-
pology on the disposition of the Goggin manuscripts, notes, papers,
etc., and outlined plans for the publication of nearly completed
manuscripts.

Publications issued by Dr. Sturtevant during the fiscal year 1964
included the translation and annotation of “A Jesuit Missionary in
South Carolina, 1569-70,” by Father Juan Rogel, pp. 167-175 in The
Indian and the White Man (edited by Wilcomb E. Washburn) ;
(with John M. Goggin) “The Calusa, a Stratified, Non-Agricultural
Society (with notes on sibling marriage),” pp. 179-219 in F'aplora-
tions in Cultural Anthropology: Essays Presented to George Peter
Murdock (edited by W. H. Goodenough) ; “Five Civilized Tribes,”
Encyclopedia Britannica, vol. 9, pp. 396-397; “Seminole,” L’ncyclo-
pedia Britannica, vol. 20, p. 318H; “John White’s Contributions to
Ethnology,” pp. 87-43 in vol. 1 of The American Drawings of John
W hite, 1577-1590 (edited by Paul H. Hulton and David B. Quinn) ;
and obituary of John M. Goggin, 1916-1963, American Anthropolo-
gist, vol. 66, No. 2, pp. 885-394.

Dr. Sturtevant ? left the country on October 4 for Burma, to under-
take field work supported by a grant from the National Science
Foundation.

From July to October Dr. Robert M. Laughlin, ethnologist, contin-
ued field work in Chiapas, Mexico, where he recorded and translated
a series of 251 dreams of the Tzotzil Indians of Zinacantan, Chiapas.
He discovered that dreams are recognized by the natives to be a form
of mental telepathy, a two-way communications system, whereby the
dreamer’s soul is in contact with the divine and with the souls of fellow
(usually hostile) mortals. Dreams are held to be an indication of an
individual’s success in withstanding enemy attack.

Dr. Laughlin spent November and December in Santa Fe, N. Mex.,
accompanied by two Zinacantec informants who provided additional
material for the compilation of a Tzotzil dictionary. His time in
Washington was devoted to continuing research on his dictionary
which involved the study of 17th- and 18th-century Tzotzil-Spanish
manuscripts. He selected much of his own textual materials for use
by the Coordinated Study of Tzeltal-Tzotzil Drinking of the Univer-
sity of Rochester. Selections of music from Zinacantén and Marti-
nique were contributed to the Cantometrics Research Project of
Columbia University for cross-cultural analysis.

In collaboration with Dr. B. N. Colby, of the Laboratory of Anthro-
pology, Museum of New Mexico, Dr. Laughlin initiated a computer

analysis of the values expressed in Tzotzil myths and dreams. It is
hoped that the results will demonstrate in specific terms the close
relationship between mythic and oneiric expression.

A chapter on Zinacantec dream interpretation written by Dr. Laugh-
lin was accepted for publication in Lnsayos Sobre Zinacantdn (E. Z.
Vogt, ed.). His chapter, entitled “Tzotzil,” for the Handbook of
Middle American Indians, is in preparation.

In addition, Dr. Laughlin attended the 62d annual meeting of the
American Anthropological Association (San Francisco, November
21-24) in company with his Zinacantec informants. A journal of their
travels in Mexico and the United States was written by the informants
in their native language. Dr. Laughlin conducted library research
at Harvard University (May 27-29) and participated in an informal
conference at Palo Alto (June 4-6) as a consultant for the Chicago-
Harvard-Stanford Chiapas Aerial Survey Project.

RIVER BASIN SURVEYS

(Prepared by Robert L. Stephenson, acting director, from data submitted by
staff members)

The River Basin Surveys, a unit of the Bureau of American Ethnol-
ogy, continued its activities throughout the year. This unit was or-
ganized in 1945 to cooperate with the National Park Service and the
Bureau of Reclamation of the Department of the Interior, the Corps
of Engineers of the Department of the Army, and State and local in-
stitutions in the program for salvage archeology in areas to be flooded
or otherwise destroyed by the construction of large dams. Its purpose
has remained the same over the years and its activities during the cur-
rent year were directed toward the same objectives. The research in-
vestigations during 1963-64 were supported by a transfer of $254,500
from the National Park Service and a carryover of $95,768 of Missouri
Basin money to support investigations within the Missouri River
Basin. Additional funds were available from two other sources. A
previous grant from the Appalachian Power Co. had a carryover of
$5,038 to support the research along the Roanoke River in southern
Virginia at the Smith Mountain Project. Another earlier contribu-
tion by the Idaho Power Co. to support the researches in the Hells
Canyon Reservoir area on the Snake River in Oregon and Idaho had
a carryover of $4,080. The latter investigation was carried on as a
cooperative project between the River Basin Surveys and the Museum
of Idaho State University at Pocatello. The grand total of funds
available for the River Basin Surveys in 1963-64 was $359,386.

Field researches consisted largely of surveys and excavations. Most

766-746—65——7
84 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

of the work was concentrated in the digging or testing of sites, but
surveys were made in four new reservoir areas in North Dakota and
one new reservoir area in South Dakota. At the beginning of the fiscal
year there were 12 crews at work. One field crew was operating in
the Smith Mountain Reservoir area in southern Virginia, seven parties
were at work in the Oahe and Big Bend Reservoir areas of South
Dakota, one party was excavating in the Yellowtail Reservoir area in
Montana and Wyoming, and another was working in the Pony Creek
drainage area in Iowa. A special crew was in Lawrence, Kans., study-
ing human skeletal remains from the Oahe Reservoir, and one survey
team was at work in North and South Dakota. During the second
quarter of the year, parties worked briefly in Alabama, Nebraska,
and Wyoming. In May two brief surveys were made in South Dakota,
and in June nine parties began major operations in the Missouri Basin,
where they were at work at the end of the fiscal year.

As of June 30, 1964, archeological surveys and excavations had
been made, since the start of the salvage program, in a total of 269
reservoir areas, located in 29 States, as well as in 2 lock projects, 4
canal areas, and 2 watershed areas. Since 1946, when the field work
of the program got underway, 5,040 sites have been located and re-
corded; of that number 1,186 were recommended for excavation or
limited testing. Because of the emergency conditions under which the
salvage program must operate, it is rarely possible to fully excavate a
site. “Excavation,” as used here, usually means that about 10 percent
of the site was dug. By the end of the fiscal year, 526 sites in 55
reservoir basins and 2 watershed areas had been tested or excavated
to a degree where good information about them had been obtained.
These sites range in nature from simple camping areas, once occupied
by early hunting and gathering Indians of some 10,000 years ago, to
village remains left by the historic Indians of the mid-19th century
and the remains of frontier trading posts and military installations
of European origin.

The results of these extensive investigations have been incorporated
in technical reports that have been published in various scientific
journals, in Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletins, and in the
Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections. River Basin Surveys Papers
Nos. 33-38, constituting Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 189,
were released in June. These papers pertain to excavations carried out
in North Dakota, South Dakota, and Kansas. Reports of other ex-
cavations in the Dakotas and in Oregon and Idaho are now being as-
sembled for another Bulletin. Staff members cooperated throughout
the year with representatives of other Federal agencies in the prepara-
tion of short popular pamphlets about some of the major reservoir
projects.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 85

As in previous years, the River Basin Surveys received helpful
cooperation from the National Park Service, the Bureau of Reclama-
tion, the Corps of Engineers, the Geological Survey, and numerous
State and local institutions. The National Park Service continued
to serve as liaison, among the various agencies, both in Washington and
in the field, and prepared budget estimates and justifications for the
funds needed to support the salvage program. Party leaders were
assisted in many ways by personnel of all the cooperating agencies,
and the relationship was outstanding in all areas.

General direction and supervision of the program were continued
from the main office in Washington. Work in the Missouri Basin was
directed by the field headquarters and laboratory in Lincoln, Nebr.
The project in Virginia was supervised by the Washington office.

Washington office-——Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts, Jr., continued the
direction of the entire River Basin Surveys from the main headquar-
ters in the Bureau of American Ethnology until October 15 when he
went on sick leave. At that time, Dr. Robert L. Stephenson, who had
been transferred from the field headquarters in Lincoln, Nebr., on
September 30, to be assistant director, was designated acting director
and served in that capacity during the remainder of the year. Carl
F. Miller and Harold A. Huscher, archeologists, were based at the
headquarters office throughout the year.

At the beginning of the year Mr. Huscher was in the Washington
office working on his materials from the Walter F. George Reservior
area and other areas along the Chattachoochee River. At the end of
October he visited the recently flooded Walter F. George Reservior
area to recheck some of the sites along the shore that were beginning
to erode, and to examine sites in the vicinity of Columbus, Ga., and
Montgomery, Ala., that are threatened with destruction from indus-
trial development. During the period December 12-25, he returned to
Montgomery, Ala., to assist the Montgomery Museum of Fine Arts in
the emergency salvage of parts of the Shine Mound site, which was
threatened with destruction by a municipal waterplant. This work
was done in cooperation with David W. Chase, curator of the Mont-
gomery Museum of Fine Arts.

On September 6-8, Mr. Huscher attended the joint Plains-Pecos
Conference at Fort Burgwin, Taos, N. Mex., where he presented a
paper on “Plains Influences Directly Recorded in Navajo and Western
Apache Culture.” In November he attended the Southeastern Arche-
ological Conference in Macon, Ga., and presented a paper entitled “A
Summary of the Walter F. George River Basin Surveys Salvage Pro-
gram.” His paper read at the preceding conference was published
under the title “The Archaic of the Walter F. George Reservior Area”
in Proceedings of the 19th Southeastern Archeological Conference,
86 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

Bulletin 1, March 1964. He attended the Eastern States Archeological
Conference during November 9-10 and there presented a report on
“The Cool Branch Site (9QU5), Quitman County, Georgia, a Forti-
fied Mississippian Town with Tower Bastions.” He participated in
a roundtable discussion of current Early Man problems at the annual
meeting of Section H of the American Association for the Advance-
ment of Science, in Cleveland, Ohio, December 26-30. Early in May
he attended the annual meeting of the Society for American Arche-
ology in Chapel Hill, N. C., and read a paper, “The Standing Boy
Flint Industry, an Early Archaic Manifestation on the Chattahoochee
River in Alabama and Georgia,” which consisted of an interim report
on three archeological sites near Columbia, Ala. The latter paper and
an ethnographic background paper on aboriginal salt trade, “Salt
Traders of Cibola,” have been accepted for publication in professional
journals.

At the beginning of the year Mr. Miller was in charge of a field
party in southern Virginia. On July 28 this project was brought to a
close and he returned to the office in Washington. During the
remainder of the year he devoted his time to research on some of his
past fieldwork. He completely revised and enlarged his preliminary
manuscript on “Prehistoric Occupations of the Ft. Lookout Site (39-
LM57), Ft. Randall Reservior, South Dakota.” He had two papers
accepted for publication in Southern Indian Studies: “A Napier-like
Pottery Vessel from Russell Cave” and “Human-headed Adornos
from Western Georgia.” He had one paper accepted for publication
in The Masterkey: “Bone Flutes from Southern Virginia.” He at-
tended the annual meetings of the Southeastern Archeological Con-
ference in Macon, Ga., early in November and presented a paper on
“The Appearance of Certain Projectile Points through Time at Russell
Cave, Alabama.” On December 30 he presented a paper at the annual
meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science,
in Cleveland, Ohio, entitled “Paleo-Indian and Early Archaic Pro-
jectile Point Forms from Russell Cave, Northern Alabama.” In
February he served as judge at two science fairs in Alexandria, Va.,
where he evaluated 195 public-school science exhibits. He prepared a
bibliography on “Hopewell Culture” and one on “The Red Paint
People” to answer inquiries from college students.

On March 21 Mr. Miller presented a paper, “The Archeology of
Southern Virginia,” at the meeting of the Shenandoah chapter of the
Archeological Society of Virginia, in Strasburg, and while there
examined several local collections of Indian materials and advised the
chapter on their plans for a spring excavation program. During May
7-9 he participated in the annual meeting of the Society for American
Archeology at Chapel Hill, N.C., and presented a paper on “The
SECRETARY’S REPORT 87

Archeological Horizons within Russell Cave, Alabama.” His article
“Polyhedral Cores from Northeastern Kansas,” published in the
Plains Anthropologist, was reprinted in The Chesopican, a journal of
Atlantic coast archeology. His monograph “The Archeological In-
vestigations at the Hosterman Site (39PO7), Oahe Reservior Area,
Potter County, South Dakota” was published as iver Basin Surveys
Paper No. 85 in Bureau of American Ethnology Bulletin 189.

Missouri Basin—At the end of its 18th year of operation, the
Missouri Basin Project was well established in new quarters at 1835
P Street, Lincoln, Nebr. Although the move to the new location was
made during fiscal year 1963, much of the new physical plant was not
completed until well into the first quarter of 1964. For the first time
in many years the Project has had enough space to meet with its cur-
rent and immediately foreseeable needs. Office accommodations are
now adequate, storage problems have been eased, and processing
facilities are vastly improved.

Activities during fiscal year 1964 included large-scale excavations,
surveys, processing and analysis of materials, preparation of manu-
scripts, and the reporting of archeological results. During the sum-
mer months, major efforts were devoted to excavations; the remainder
of the year was devoted largely to analyses and the preparation of
reports. The special chronology program begun in January 1958 was
continued throughout the year. Dr. Robert L. Stephenson served as
chief of the Project through the first quarter of the fiscal year. At the
beginning of the second quarter he was succeeded by Dr. Warren W.
Caldwell, who continued in the position through the remainder of the
year.

At the beginning of the year the permanent staff, in addition to the
chief, consisted of 9 archeologists, 1 administrative assistant, 1 secre-
tary, 1 administrative clerk, 2 clerk-typists, 1 scientific illustrator, 1
photographer, and 4 museum aides. The temporary staff consisted of
73 persons. There were 3 archeologists, 2 physical anthropologists,
4 cooks, and 64 field crewmen.

During July and August, 12 field crewmen were added to the tem-
porary staff. By the end of the last week in September the employ-
ment of all the field crewmen and cooks had been terminated, with
the exception of one crewman who was later transferred to the perma-
nent staff as museum aide. The services of all the other temporary
employees were terminated by early October. Other changes in the
permanent staff were: termination of positions of one museum aide, one
archeologist, and the administrative clerk; the death of one museum
aide, and the appointment of one museum aide and one laborer. The
chief was transferred to the Bureau of American Ethnology on Sep-
tember 30. Additions to the temporary staff during June were 2
archeologists, 5 cooks, and 66 field crewmen.
88 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

At the end of the fiscal year the permanent staff consisted of 19
persons; these were, in addition to the chief, 7 archeologists, 1 ad-
ministrative officer, 1 secretary, 1 administrative clerk (typist), 1
clerk-typist, 1 scientific illustrator, 1 photographer, 4 museum aides,
and 1 laborer. The temporary staff consisted of 73 persons. There
were 2 archeologists, 5 cooks, and 66 field crewmen.

During the year there were 24 Smithsonian Institution, River Basin
Surveys, field parties at work in the Missouri Basin. Eleven of these
were in operation during July and August, 2 during October and No-
vember, and 11 during June.

At the beginning of the year John J. Hoffman and a crew of 10
men were excavating at the La Roche sites (89ST9, 89ST232)? in the
Big Bend Reservoir of central South Dakota. Site 89ST9, on the
right bank of the Missouri near the mouth of P L creek, consists of
about 90 house depressions scattered over an area of about 80 acres.
Seven circular houses were excavated, all of which were essentially
similar and which appear to be representative of the Chouteau Aspect.

The site also produced evidence of the Grand Detour Phase, an
early development within the prehistoric Middle Missouri Tradition,
as well asa small oval structure assignable, on the basis of the ceramics,
to the Plains Woodland Phase. Fortunately, the stratigraphic evi-
dence is clear. The Plains Woodland component precedes the Grand
Detour component which in turn underlies the principal Chouteau
occupation. While these temporal relationships have been recognized
for some time, there have been few instances of such satisfactory super-
imposition.

Site 89ST232 occupies something less than 40 acres of level terrace
114 miles north of 89ST9. Of the six or seven depressions visible, two
were investigated. Both proved to contain circular houses of the
Chouteau Aspect. However, one was distinctive in its large diameter
(75 feet) and in the presence of six central support posts instead of the
usual pattern of four. On the basis of artifacts and architectural
evidence, the Chouteau components of 39ST232 and 39ST9 appear
to be intimately related. The field party completed work on August
30, after 79 days in the field.

A second field party of nine men, directed by Richard E. Jensen,
was at work in the cul-de-sac in the central part of the Big Bend
Reservoir. This region, on the left bank of the Missouri, within the
great bend that gives the reservoir its name, contains a large number

2Site designations used by the River Basin Surveys are trinomial in character, con-

SECRETARY’S REPORT 89

of archeological sites. Although 10 of them were excavated or tested
by the field group, results were not encouraging. Apparently the
area was occupied quite extensively but cultural debris is scanty and
the habitation sites thin.

At the Gregg site (839HY222), one of the largest in the pocket,
portions of two earth lodges were excavated and five interhouse areas
were tested. A single circular lodge and several tests were dug at the
Fry site (39HU223), two lodges were exposed at site 39 HU224 nearby,
and a lodge and two large cache pits were cleared at the Hawk site
(89HU238). Architectural features were not found at the remaining
sites, but several clusters of exterior cache pits were cleared at the
Saint John site (89HU218) and artifact collections were made at
sites 89HU225, 39HU230, 39HU231, 839HU249, and 39HU250.

The earth-lodge structures excavated within the area of the cul-de-
sac are all quite similar. Each was circular, with an irregular pat-
tern of wall posts and four central supports. Entrance passages,
where found, opened to the south or southwest. A small central
hearth was characteristic and there were usually secondary firepits
and one or more small basin-like or bell-shaped cache pits.

Ceramics were preponderantly simple-stamped, with Talking Crow
and “Category B” rims most usual. Other artifacts were not distinc-
tive, and except for several copper pendants and an iron blade hafted
in a split bison rib from the Hawk site, there was no evidence of
European contact.

On August 12 Jensen transferred his field party to the right bank of
the Missouri where he assisted Hoffman in the excavation of the La
Roche sites. The party completed work on August 23, after 72 days
in the field.

At the beginning of the year, a third party of nine men, directed by
William J. Folan, was assisting John J. Hoffman in excavations at the
La Roche sites. On July 16 the Folan party moved to the left bank
of the Missouri to begin work at the Chapelle Creek or Grandle site
(39HU60), a large, fortified, multicomponent village in the central
Big Bend Reservoir. Extensive trenching, exposing sections of three
houses, a section of the defensive ditch, and a number of other features,
was completed. Evidence of the earliest occupation consists solely of
artifacts that are invariably found in the prehistoric, rectangular
house complexes of the Big Bend region. The second component
consists of the fortified settlement proper, which seems to be attribut-
able to the historic Stanley-Le Beau complexes usually regarded as
Arikara. The uppermost deposits contain additional Kuropean ma-
terials that are suspected to be the remains of a small (and poorly
documented) trading post. In view of our present knowledge of the
early history of the Big Bend region, it may be difficult, if not impos-
90 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

sible, to distinguish the traders’ remains from those of the 18th-century
Arikara.

During the first half of the field season the Folan group shared camp
facilities with the Hoffman crew. The party completed work in
August 30, after 79 days in the field.

At the beginning of the year a fourth party of five men, directed
by G. Hubert Smith, was investigating historic sites within the Big
Bend Reservoir. Excavations were made at the Red Cloud Agency
(39L.M247), on the right bank of the Missouri near Medicine Creek.
The Agency, established for the Oglala Sioux, under Red Cloud, was
used only briefly (1877-78) before the group was settled permanently
on the Pine Ridge Reservation. Although little survived at the Red
Cloud site (apparently the buildings had been systematically re-
moved), some structural details were recovered together with a small
group of representative specimens.

A thorough search was made of Dorion or Cedar Island, near the
mouth of Cedar Creek, for the site of a trading post established in
1802 or 1803 by Regis Loisel. Despite excellent descriptions left by
members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition, the post could not be
located; however, another site (89HU301) found on the island was
partially excavated. Cultural remains were not abundant but the
appearance of the site and the presence of a number of machine-made
objects suggest that the site was occupied during the 1860’s by White
“squatters” who supplied wood for steamboat fuel.

An intensive reconnaissance was made near the mouth of Medicine
Creek, continuing a search begun some years ago for the Fort Defiance
(or Bouis) trading post known to have been in existence in the 1840’s.
Although there were several hopeful leads, the search was fruitless.
The Smith party shared camp facilities with Hoffman’s crew. They
returned to Lincoln on August 30 after 79 days in the field.

Three field parties were at work in the Oahe Reservoir at the begin-
ning of the fiscal year. The first, a crew of 10 men, directed by Robert
W. Neuman, was excavating at two prehistoric sities in Dewey County
on the right bank of the Missouri near Mobridge, S. Dak. The Grover
Hand Mounds (39DW240) include five tumuli, one of which was ex-
cavated by Neuman in 1963. Two additional examples were dug
during the current year. The first was 90 feet in diameter and slightly
more than 4 feet high. It covered a central subfloor burial pit con-
taining about 23 secondary human burials of both sexes and various
ages, some of which were sprinkled with hematite. The burials were
in association with a number of implements and ornaments of bone and
stone. Support logs overlay the burial pit, and above was another
secondary burial partly covered by an inverted basket and associated
with stone and shell artifacts. On the mound floor, adjacent to the
SECRETARY’S REPORT 9]

pit, were the partially articulated skeletons of at least six bison. The
second mound was much the same as the first. However, the burial
pit did not contain more than 12 individuals, and there were no human
remains above.

Artifact materials from the two mounds included a few cord-
paddled pottery cherds, rentalium, busycon and olivella ornaments, an
antler pin, worked antler butts and tines, bone awls, beads, serrated
fleshers, beaver incisors, stone projectile points, matting, pigments,
and a considerable variety of other materials. On the basis of burial
pattern and the artifacts excavated, the Grover Hand Mounds show
a very close relationship to the neighboring Swift Bird Mounds
(89D W233) and to the Boundary and Baldhill Mound sites in North
Dakota.

At the end of July the Neuman party shifted to the Stelzer site
(839DW242) to continue excavations begun during 1963. This site
is a large camp area only a short distance from the Grover Hand
Mounds. The occupation level, less than 114 feet below the present
surface, is characterized by scattered midden heaps, small firepits, and
circular pits filled with detritus. There were also 17 randomly dis-
tributed bison long bones stuck vertically into the occupation surface.
Artifacts from the Stelzer site, particularly projectile points and pot-
tery, are closely comparable to those from the adjacent mound sites.
There seems to be good evidence here for the first direct relationship
between burial mounds and a habitation site in the northern Plains.

The party concluded work on August 23 after 74 days in the field.
Subsequently, Neuman and a single crewman visited previously unre-
ported mound sites along the Sheyenne River in Barnes County, N.
Dak., and another above Wolfe Creek in the James River Valley, S.
Dak.

A second party of seven men, under the leadership of Oscar L.
Mallory, conducted test excavations at a large group of sites in Dewey
County, along the right bank of the Missouri a short distance upstream
from the mouth of the Moreau River. Site 89DW231, a small village
on a terrace spur defended by two ditches, was tested extensively. A
midden area, part of a circular house, and sections of the defensive
system were exposed. Present evidence suggests that the principal
occupation falls within the Chouteau Aspect and appears to be related
to the Potts (89CD19) and No Heart (89AR1) villages of northern
South Dakota.

A second fortified village, 39DW1, situated at the mouth of the
Moreau River, was also tested. It differs from 39DW231 in that it
lay on a higher terrace and was completely surrounded by a defensive
ditch. The ceramic collections have much in common but apparently
differences are such that they cannot be related on the focus level.
92 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

The remaining sites investigated, 39DW230, 39D W229, 89DW228,
39DW253, and 89DW254, were unfortified; pottery attributed to the
La Roche horizon was usual. Portions of houses were excavated at
39D W228, 39DW229, and 839DW230. In each case the houses were
circular with a central firepit and four central roof supports.

A number of additional sites were mapped or examined and a brief
period was devoted to explorations at the Stelzer site. The latter is
quite large, extending along the river for at least three-quarters of a
mile. Mallory’s tests were placed near the eastern end of the site.
The pottery found here was identical to that found by Neuman’s con-
tinuing excavations near the western edge. The Mallory party
shared camp facilities with the Neuman crew, and returned to Lincoln
on August 23 after 74 days in the field.

A third party of 12 men was directed by Dr. Alfred W. Bowers of
the University of Idaho but temporarily attached to the Smithsonian
Institution. The Bowers crew excavated at three small fortified vil-
lage sites in the immediate vicinity of Mobridge,S. Dak. At the Red
Horse Hawk site (89CO34), on the right bank of the Missouri, con-
tinuing work begun in the summer of fiscal year 1963, the excavation
of 15 shallow circular houses was completed and the fortification ditch
was tested in several places. This village, which is probably pro-
tohistoric, has produced a wealth of museum display specimens and is
one of the two or three completely excavated sites within the Oahe
Reservoir.

Work was also renewed at the Davis site (39CO14), a fortified vil-
lage adjacent to the Red Horse Hawk site, continuing 1963 excava-
tions. During the current season investigations were hampered by
drought conditions which made the soil both intractable and “unread-
able.” With the use of a water wagon and power equipment, one lodge
was completely excavated and the covering fill was removed from four
others, but work could be carried no further.

The Davis site is an exceedingly important one because it appears to
bridge the temporal gap between the rectangular and circular house
complexes. The early component at the Davis site is distinctive in
that lodges are placed within the bastions at the corners of the fortifi-
cation, thus limiting the entrance passage to a narrow lane around the
lodge.

Work was begun at the Larson site (89WW2), a small compact
village on the left bank of the Missouri River south of Mobridge. The
site consists of 29 circular depressions tightly clustered within an oval
fortification ditch. Ten of the lodge depressions were trenched and
two were completely excavated. The latter seem to have been rebuilt
several times, but each new construction was smaller than the previous
one. The most recent occupation seems to have been brought to an
SECRETARY’S REPORT 93

end by the smallpox epidemic of A.D. 1780. There is no documentary
evidence to this effect but human remains were strewn over the lodge
floors. The skeletons of at least 80 individuals were exposed in one
house, 8 in another, and there is evidence of additional skeletons in the
remaining lodges. Since the deaths do not appear to have been due to
violence, epidemic disease is inferred. In addition to the historic
component or components at the Larson site, there are indications of
an earlier Woodland occupation.

Bowers also conducted a limited survey along the now eroding banks
of the Oahe Reservoir. A large collection of artifacts and bison bone
was secured from the Rygh (89CA4) and Bamble (39CA6) villages
where shoreline cutting has been extensive. Since the origin of these
materials can be localized within the respective sites, they will be ex-
ceedingly useful for comparative studies. The party completed work
on September 7 after 89 days in the field.

At the beginning of the fiscal year a field crew of five men, directed
by Wilfred M. Husted, was excavating in the Yellowtail Reservoir
along the Big Horn River of southern Montana and northern Wyo-
ming. At the Mangus site (24CB221),a small rock shelter on the left
bank of the river in Carbon County, Mont., three distinct occupation
levels were found, the most recent of which was Late Prehistoric. A
variety of artifacts was recovered here, including small triangular
projectile points with and without side notches, stone knives, scrapers,
fragments of sewn hide, cordage, and basketry. The middle zone
carried obvious evidence of human use, but artifacts were too few to
identify the nature of the occupation. The lowest level contained
Agate Basin points, knives, scrapers and a mortar and pestle. Sub-
sequently, a radiocarbon date of 1070 + 70 B.P. (A.D. 880) was
obtained from charcoal in a roasting pit found in the Late Prehistoric
level, and two dates, 8690 + 100 B.P. (6740 B.C.) and 8600 + 100 B.P.
(6650 B.C.) were secured from charcoal from the Agate Basin level.

Three other rock shelters in the vicinity, the Ledge site (24BH 252),
the Greene site (24BH 253), and site 24BH255, all in Big Horn
County, Mont., yielded artifacts of the Late Prehistoric Period. The
Red Earth site (24BH251), another small shelter, contained a Late
Prehistoric level, an unidentified occupation characterized by shallow,
circular firepits, numerous small flakes, a mano and knife fragments.

Site 24BH 250, also in Big Horn County, Mont., was a small shelter
with the entrance barricaded with rocks and juniper branches. A
large fireplace outlined by rocks was intact on the surface, and below
it was another containing burned stones and associated with a tri-
angular projectile point.

A large, shallow, rock-filled firepit was excavated at site 24BH257,
a small shelter formed by a large block fallen from the canyon wall.
94 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

Three corner-notched projectile points and several flakes were in asso-
ciation with the firepit. Until this site was excavated only simple
triangular points or triangular points with side notches had been
found with such firepits.

Three firepits, projectile points, scrapers, and a variety of worked
flakes were found in tests at 24BH210, a large open site in Big Horn
County. Two additional open sites, 24BH254 and 24BH259, were
located in a badly eroded area, and tests showed that artifacts were
restricted to the surface.

Site 24BH204 at the mouth of Porcupine Creek was tested but with
negative results. Animal bone was abundant but it may have origi-
nated from gold camps that once operated at this location. Site
24BH214, about 1 mile above the mouth of Porcupine Creek, was only
slightly more productive. Artifacts were limited to a corner-notched
projectile point and a few scrapers.

Late in the season, the Husted party made exploratory tests at site
48BH217, in Big Horn County, Wyo., a short distance south of the
Montana border. An Agate Basin point was found here in the course
of land leveling for a cabin. Although tests were extensive, little of
significance was recovered. The party completed its work on August
29 after 72 days in the field.

Another field party of nine men, under the direction of Lionel A.
Brown, was working in the Pony Creek watershed in southwestern
Towa. A survey of the area added a number of new sites to the record,
a number of tests were made, and five sites were excavated. Unfortu-
nately, most of the endangered sites examined by the field party had
been damaged in some degree by erosion or cultivation; nonetheless,
architectural remains were found at four of them.

Two square houses were excavated at the Stonebrook Village
(18ML219) and fragments of house floors were found at both the
Downing (18ML218) and Steinheimer (183ML222) sites. The house
structures ranged from 20 to 30 feet square, with deep vertical walls
and entrances approaching 15 feet in length. The associated artifacts
include ceramics of the Beckman and McVey series, clay effigies and
pipestems, side-notched projectile points, ovoid to triangular knives,
planoconvex end scrapers, pecked and chipped celts, but surprisingly
very little worked bone.

The Thomas site (183ML204) contained a mixture of pottery pri-
marily representative of the Woodland horizon and the Central Plains
Tradition. The rimsherd collection includes examples of Sterns
Creek, Beckman Ware, Swoboda Ware, and one example classified as
Anderson Low Rim. The primary feature at the site was a pit, 20 feet
square, similar to house pits reported for the Woodland of eastern
Nebraska.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 95

The Lungren site (183ML224) is an archaic camp first noted at a
depth of 10 feet below the surface in a high cutbank. The cultural
deposit proved to consist of a narrow (ca. 2 inches thick) zone of
charcoal-stained soil mixed with large quantities of chipping debris
and bone fragments. The only projectile point recovered is side-
notched with basal grinding. It is similar to those from the Long
Creek site in Saskatchewan, the Logan Creek and Spring Creek sites
in Nebraska, and the Simonsen and Hill sites in Nebraska. Other
artifacts include triangular to ovoid knives, small planoconvex end
scrapers, hammerstones, chipped celts and choppers. Bone artifacts
were absent. Several midden areas and a basin-shaped firepit consti-
tute the only nonartifact features of the deposit. The party com-
pleted work on August 30 after 81 days in the field.

A special field party consisting of a varying number of students
directed by Dr. William M. Bass ITI, assisted by Walter Birkby, was
working in the laboratory at the University of Kansas, Lawrence,
Kans., at the beginning of the fiscal year. Dr. Bass was continuing
a study of the human skeletal remains and burial patterns from the
Sully site (839SL4) begun in 1957.

A total of 557 burials was excavated from the cemeteries at the
Sully Village. This is the largest single sample from a site in the
Plains. It is not likely to be equaled in the immediate future. If
the ethnic affiliation of the site is substantiated, the sample provides
a baseline for the study of the early historic Arikara population.

In addition to observations and metric analyses, the group tabu-
lated data on burial orientation, burial goods, and grave types. At
the same time, three members of the University of South Dakota
medical staff examined the physical material to record the incidence of
nose, throat, and ear diseases occurring the population. Bass com-
pleted his study on August 2 after 63 days of work.

A field party, consisting of a crew of two men under the leadership
of Dr. Elden Johnson, of the University of Minnesota, but tempo-
rarily attached to the Smithsonian Institution, began work on June 22
surveying several small reservoirs in North Dakota. <A single, very
thin, habitation site (39BE1), was found at the James River damsite
in Beadle County, S. Dak. Although the area was trenched exten-
sively, the results were minimal. No additional sites were found
within the proposed reservoir, but a number of local collections that
originated in adjacent areas were examined, Since the James River
Dam is part of the much larger Oahe Diversion Project, these collec-
tions will become important for future research when the larger proj-
ect is activated.

The Garrison Diversion Project proposes construction of four major
reservoirs and an extensive system of feeder canals within eastern
96 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

North Dakota. Archeological work during the current year was con-
centrated within the reservoir areas since the canal routes are not yet
established. The Taayer Reservoir east of Oakes, N. Dak., is pres-
ently an open water slough. No sites were found to be endangered
but a probable bison kill site (832SA1) was reported here in the 1930’s
when the reservoir was dry. A “stone ring” site (82SA2) was re-
corded by the survey party but it lies in the uplands outside of the
reservoir. Hamburg Reservoir on the upper James River produced
no sites. New Home Reservoir, in McLean County, N. Dak., east
and south of the Garrison Dam, is in a long glacial drainage trench.
Only a single site, 82M1L212, was found here. It consisted princi-
pally of bison bone eroding from a cutbank but a number of chalcedony
flakes were found in association.

The Lone Tree Reservoir, which will include the headwaters of the
Sheyenne River, held a number of sites and others were found in the
immediate vicinity. Probably the most significant within the reser-
voir is 832SHQ2, a large complex of boulder burial mounds. At least
14 mounds are included, and associated habitation sites are possible.
The party completed its survey on September 20. Because work was
intermittent, the field season totaled only 49 days.

A postseason (October 21-November 4) field party of two men,
directed by Wilfred M. Husted, excavated at Fort Laramie National
Historic Site, testing in four localities that will be affected by future
expansion of visitor facilities. The remains of what is probably the
Ward anad Guerrier trading post were found, as well as evidences of
an aboriginal occupation. The latter was far too scanty to even
hazard an ethnic or archeological affiliation.

Late in September representatives of the Nebraska Game, Foresta-
tion and Parks Commission contacted the Missouri Basin Project con-
cerning certain stone and pottery artifacts found during biological
research in the Little Nemaha drainage of southeastern Nebraska.
The artifacts examined by the Missouri Basin Project staff included
materials suggesting the presence of Stearns Creek, Logan Creek, and
Agate Basin complexes. On November 12, after the heavy summer
vegetation was gone, Robert W. Neuman reexamined the area in com-
pany with Nebraska game biologists. Previous find spots were exam-
ined on Brownell Creek and Wolf Creek, but unfortunately the arti-
facts found to date have been secondary deposits and no true occupa-
tion sites were discovered.

Cooperating institutions working in the Missouri Basin at the be-
ginning of the fiscal year included the University of Montana, the
University of South Dakota, the University of Nebraska, the Uni-
versity of Missouri, and the Kansas State Historical Society.

Dr. Dee C. Taylor of the University of Montana continued the
SECRETARY’S REPORT 97

shoreline survey of Fort Peck Reservoir of east-central Montana,
locating archeological sites exposed by shoreline erosion. Robert Gant
of the W. H. Over Museum, University of South Dakota, surveyed
the shoreline of Lewis and Clark Lake (the former Gavins Point
Reservoir). Dr. Preston Holder, assisted by James Marshall with
a crew of students from the University of Nebraska, began salvage
excavations in the Glen Elder Reservoir of northwestern Kansas.
Several University of Missouri field parties, directed by Dr. Carl
H. Chapman, excavated in the Kaysinger Bluff, Stockton, and Mera-
mec Basin Reservoirs of Missouri. Each of these field parties oper-
ated under agreements with the National Park Service and the Smith-
sonian Institution in the Inter-Agency Salvage Program.

The 1964 field season began with two small survey teams exam-
ining sites in the upper Big Bend Reservoir. During the winter of
1964 the Missouri Basin Project staff had become aware that the wat-
ers behind the Big Bend Dam were rising faster than had been antici-
pated. Under the circumstances it was impossible to plan fieldwork
for the approaching summer season without a close check on the
changing conditions. On April 6 and 7, Richard E. Jensen and
Oscar L. Mallory of the Project staff visited archeological sites along
the left bank of the reservoir between Chapelle Creek and the city
of Pierre. Severe weather conditions made it impossible to examine
other areas, but as of that time water damage did not appear to be
extensive. The reservoir level had reached a point just below many
sites, and at least one, 39HU60 at Chapelle Creek, was then an island.
Another reconnaissance was made by Jensen and Lionel A. Brown
on May 7 and 8, but despite a slight interim rise of water level, the
archeological situation had not changed significantly.

On June 9, a group of seven men directed by Wilfred M. Husted,
began work in the Yellowtail Reservoir of Montana and Wyoming.
This is the third and last season of excavation within the reservoir
area. Previously, Smithsonian Institution field parties had concen-
trated in the lower and central parts of the reservoir. This year
excavations are restricted to the upper Big Horn Canyon, thus com-
pleting the investigation of major sites within the reservoir. At the
end of the fiscal year the crew was surveying within the upper
reservoir.

On June 10 three additional field parties began work within the Big
Bend Reservoir of central South Dakota. The first, a group of nine
men directed by Richard E. Jensen, was carrying out large-scale test-
ing at the Sommers site (39ST56) on the right bank of the Missouri
adjacent to the La Roche sites. It is one of the most significant villages
of the Middle Missouri Tradition surviving within the reservoir. The
village contains at least 70 house depressions and has a particularly
98 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

thick mantle of debris. It is probable that two or more seasons of
work will be required to secure an adequate sample from the site. As
a consequence, the current excavations are exploratory, designed to
provide an outline for further work. As of the end of the fiscal year,
tests were underway in two long-rectangular houses in preparation for
the use of power equipment to remove the heavy layer of overburden.

A second field party of 11 men, under the leadership of John J. Hoff-
man, was excavating at site 39ST17, a compact fortified village on the
right bank of the Missouri near the mouth of Fort George Creek. The
site is a relatively late one and probably can be attributed to the
Arikara of the 18th century. Since the village is small, it is planned
to excavate the entire occupied area. By the end of the fiscal year
several tests were completed and a small circular house was exposed.
Artifacts were few but indicate an affiliation with the Phillip Ranch
site. The Hoffman and Jensen parties shared a camp near Fort George
Creek, only a short distance from 39ST17.

A third party, consisting of eight men, directed by Lionel A. Brown,
was working at the Chapelle Creek site, 39H U60, continuing excava-
tions begun during the summer of 1963. A considerable amount of
material has already been excavated from the site, but much of it is
inconclusive. The purpose of the Brown party is to find the neces-
sary relationships essential to bring the previous work into focus.
At the end of the fiscal year the ravages of the past winter had been
repaired and excavation of a shallow earth lodge of the historic period
was well underway.

On June 22, a party of three men under the leadership of David T.
Jones, temporarily attached to the Smithsonian Institution, was sur-
veying, mapping, and testing the sites remaining within the upper Big
Bend Reservoir. The results of the survey will be used as a basis for
selecting the sites to be investigated during the next (and probably
final) year of work within the reservoir.

On June 15, two field parties, one under the general direction of
Robert W. Neuman, with field supervision by Oscar L. Mallory, and
the other under Mallory’s direction, began work in the Oahe Reservoir.
The first, consisting of nine men, was excavating at the Stelzer site
(39DW242) near Mobridge, S. Dak., continuing the excavations of
1963. The second party of eight resumed work at site 39DW231, a
multicomponent, fortified village first tested last year. By the end
of the fiscal year both groups had removed the overwinter slumpage
and had begun the excavation of a number of habitation features.

A third party of 12 men, working under the direction of Dr. Alfred
W. Bowers, began excavations in the Mobridge area of the Oahe
Reservoir on June 17. The Bowers party was to complete the investi-
gation of the Red Horse Hawk (39CO14) and Larson (39WW2) sites
begun during earlier field seasons. At the end of the fiscal year the
SECRETARY’S REPORT 99

fill had been removed from several houses and a large cut had been
made across the defensive ditch.

A final field party of two men, under the direction of G. Hubert
Smith, conducted a survey of historic sites in the Big Bend, Oahe, and
Fort Randall Reservoirs from June 23 to 28. As was the case with
the aboriginal sites, high water within the reservoirs has become a
threat to previously undamaged historic sites. The Smith party
examined a number of sites, made a photographic record of sites now
destroyed or in the process of destruction, and secured data necessary
for future work.

There were seven cooperating institutions working within the Mis-
souri Basin at the end of the fiscal year. The St. Paul Science Museum
completed a survey of the Bowman-Haley Reservoir of northwestern
South Dakota and in late May and in early June began a shoreline
reconnaissance of the Garrison Reservoir in North Dakota. In both
instances the field parties were directed by Vernon R. Helmen. Uni-
versity of Missouri field parties, under the direction of Dr. Carl F.
Chapman, were surveying and excavating in the Stockton and Kay-
singer Bluff Reservoirs in Missouri, continuing the work of past sea-
sons. University of Nebraska parties, directed by Dr. Preston Holder,
were excavating in the Glen Elder and Milford Reservoirs of north-
western Kansas. A State University of South Dakota group, led
by Dr. James H. Howard, was continuing investigations within the
Lewis and Clark Lake area along the border of South Dakota and
Nebraska. A field group of the State Historical Society of North
Dakota, under the direction of Dr. Donald J. Lehmer, was excavating
at the Fire Heart Creek Village (32SI2) in the Upper Oahe Reservoir
of southern North Dakota. <A field party of the Kansas State Histori-
cal Society, under the general direction of Thomas A. Witty, was
excavating in the Council Grove Reservoir of eastern Kansas, and a
field group from Iowa State University, directed by David Gradwohl,
was excavating in the Red Rock Reservoir of central Iowa.

During the period that the Missouri Basin Project archeologists
were not in the field, they were engaged in analyses of their materials
and in laboratory and library research. They also prepared manu-
scripts of technical reports and wrote articles of a popular nature.
In addition to the regular staff, Dr. Alfred W. Bowers, of the Univer-
sity of Idaho; Dr. William M. Bass, of the University of Kansas; and
Dr. Elden Johnson, of the University of Minnesota, joined the Mis-
sour! Basin Project to complete short-term laboratory and field
research assignments. Dr. Bowers again became a temporary staff
member on June 17, and David T. Jones, West Nottingham Academy,
Maryland, on June 22. Both were on duty through the end of the
fiscal year.

100 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

By the end of the fiscal year the Missouri Basin Chronology Program
has been in operation 614 years. The cooperation of other institutions
and individuals within the anthropological profession continued as in
the past. Dendrochronological research has been much reduced be-
cause personnel were lacking. However, some new material was
studied and plans have been completed for a renewed attack during
the coming year. The carbon-14 section continued to progress with
the addition of 15 new dates. Eight dates, from three sites, apply to
villages of both the Middle Missouri and Coalescent Tradition of the
Big Bend Reservoir, central South Dakota. Three additional dates
derive from two sites, a group of burial mounds and a late fortified
village, in the Oahe Reservoir of northern South Dakota. The re-
mainder date various preceramic horizons from a stratified site in
the Yellowtail Reservoir, Mont. The Missouri Basin Chronology Pro-
gram continued to use the facilities of Isotopes, Inc., as well as those
of the division of radiation and organisms of the Smithsonian
Institution.

The laboratory and office staff of the Missouri Basin Project de-
voted most of its effort during the year to the processing of materials
for study, preparing specimen records, typing, filing, and illustrat-
ing records and manuscripts. The accomplishments of the laboratory
and office staff are listed in tables 1 and 2.

During the first quarter, Dr. Robert L. Stephenson, chief, devoted
most of his time to the overall management of the Missouri Basin
Project, including the office and laboratory in Lincoln and the several
field parties. He devoted a portion of his time to laboratory analysis
of materials he had excavated in previous years. His report, “The
Accokeek Creek Site: A Middle Atlantic Seaboard Culture Sequence,”
was published by the University of Michigan, and he submitted several
book reviews for publication. Until September 30, when he assumed
his new duties as assistant director of the River Basin Surveys in
Washington, D.C., he continued to serve as chairman of the Missouri
Basin Chronology Program, as assistant editor of “Current Research”
in the Plains area for American Antiquity, and as editor of the Plains
Anthropologist.

Dr. Warren W. Caldwell worked in the laboratory through the first
quarter, analyzing materials excavated in the previous two field sea-
sons. A substantial portion of a manuscript entitled, “The Grand
Detour Phase: Early Village Sites in the Big Bend Reservoir, South
Dakota” (with Richard E. Jensen) was completed by September 30, at
which time Dr. Caldwell assumed the duties of Chief of the Missouri
Basin Project. During the remainder of the year, Dr. Caldwell devoted
a substantial portion of his time to the management of the Project,
to budgetary matters, and to the planning of the forthcoming field

1 As of June 30, 1964, the Missouri Basin Project has cataloged 1,485,104 specimens from 2,250 numbered
sites and 66 collections not assigned site numbers.

Specimens restored included 2 pottery vessels and 5 vessel sections.

Specimens donated to the Missouri Basin Project included ca. 100 rim sherds and 1 vessel section from
the Swan Creek site (39W W7) (donated by the South Dakota State Museum, University of South Dakota),
15 projectile points from the Rinehardt Buffalo Kill No. 2 (24LT00) (donated by Carle Leavitt of
Conrad, Mont.), a surface collection from 39Y K203 (donated by George Kostal and Ansel Petersen, civil
engineers at the Gavins Point Dam), and a collection of pottery sherds from the Southwest (donated by
Dr. Frank H. H. Roberts).

Specimens collected at Fort Laramie, Wyo., were cleaned but not cataloged by the Missouri
Basin Project.

season. In addition, he continued to work with Jensen on the “Grand
Detour Phase” manuscript and prepared a monograph, “Archeological
Salvage Investigations in the Hells Canyon area, Snake River, Oregon
and Idaho,” for publication by the Bureau of American Ethnology.
During the year several papers of which Dr. Caldwell was author or
co-author were published. These include “Excavations in the Lower
Big Bend Reservoir, South Dakota,” Plains Anthropologist, vol. 8,
No. 20, p. 118; “Taxonomy Revisited,” Plains Anthropologist, vol. 8,
No. 20, pp. 84-85; (with G. Hubert Smith) The Oahe Reservoir:
Archeology, Geology, History, U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Omaha,
pp. 1-44; (with Lee G. Madison and Bernard Golden) “Archeological
Investigations at the Hickey Brothers Site (89LM4), Big Bend Reser-
voir, Lyman County, South Dakota,” River Basin Surveys Papers

“Fortified Villages in the Northern Plains,” Plains Anthropologist,
vol. 9, No. 23, pp. 1-7.

At the 201%4 Plains Conference held at Pierre, S. Dak., on July 20
Dr. Caldwell spoke on the problem of the firearms trade and Plains
archeology. He also attended the Governors’ Conference for the
Lewis and Clark Reenactment Pageant at Camp Ashland on Novem-
ber 19 and presented a brief statement regarding the potential con-
tribution of the Missouri Basin Project to region-wide recreational
planning. On September 6 and 7 he participated in the joint Plains-
Pecos Conference at Fort Burgwin, near Taos, N. Mex., and spoke
on “The LaRoche Problem.” He also attended the meetings of the
Committee for the Recovery of Archeological Remains, in Washing-
ton, D.C., on February 12 and 18; the 74th Meeting of the Nebraska
Academy of Sciences, Lincoln, May 1 and 2; and the annual meeting
of the Montana Archeological Society, Havre, May 16 and 17. At
the last-named he presented a paper, “The Northwestern Plains and
the Missouri River Basin,” and participated in a panel discussion of
Plains archeological problems. He continued to serve as dendro-
chronology chairman of the Missouri Basin Chronology Program
and, until December, as contributing editor for reviews for the Plains
Anthropologist. As of that time he replaced Dr. Stephenson as
editor of the journal and continued in that capacity through the year.
Dr. Caldwell participated in the Visiting Scientist Program of the
Nebraska Academy of Sciences, speaking before student groups at
Utica, Nebr., on January 8. In addition, he presented talks or lec-
tures to eight civic and university groups. In October he was named
as one of the organizers for the Plains Field Conference preceding
the 1965 INQUA meeting at Boulder, Colo. During the period of
September to June he continued to serve, on annual leave, as part-
time assistant professor of anthropology at the University of Ne-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 103

braska, and in January he was elected to the Graduate College. At
the end of the year Dr. Caldwell was in the Lincoln office continuing
his administrative duties.

Lionel A. Brown, archeologist, when not in the field, devoted his
time to laboratory study and reporting of materials from his 1962
and 1963 surveys and excavations. In addition, he assumed responsi-
bility for a portion of the backlog of unreported sites contained in the
Missouri Basin Project files. During the spring Mr. Brown made a
preliminary analysis of the specimens excavated from the Chapelle
Creek Village (89HU60) during the 1963 season as a guide to further
work at the site. A manuscript entitled “Archeological Investigations
in the Lower Yellowtail Reservoir, Montana,” was rewritten in second
draft. Another, a comprehensive report, “Archeological Investiga-
tions in the Pony Creek Watershed, Iowa,” was in rough draft form,
and “The Gillette Site (39ST23), Oahe Reservoir, South Dakota,”
was in near final form. During the year his survey report, “An
Appraisal of the Archeological and Paleontological Resources of Six
Reservoir Areas in Kansas and Nebraska,” was issued for limited
distribution. Two brief field reports, “Survey of the Pony Creek
Watershed, Iowa,” and “Archeology of the Lower Yellowtail Reser-
voir, Montana,” (Plains Anthropologist, vol. 8, No. 20, p. 117, and vol.
8, No. 20, p. 119, respectively) and two articles “The Fort Smith Medi-
cine Wheel, Montana” and “A Crow Lodge Frame” were published
in the Plains Anthropologist (vol. 8, No. 22, pp. 225-230, 273-274,
respectively). Another, “The Lungren Site: An Archaic Manifesta-
tion in Southeastern Iowa,” appeared in abstract in the Proceedings
of the 74th Annual Meeting of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences,
Lincoln (p.3). On May 24, at the annual meeting of the Iowa Arche-
ological Society, he presented a summary of recent work in south-
western Iowa, and on the 25th he made a brief survey of sites in the
Rathbun Reservoir of south-central Iowa. At the end of the year
Mr. Brown was again in the field engaged in archeological excavations
at the Chapelle Creek site, S. Dak.

John J. Hoffman, archeologist, when not in the field, devoted most
of his efforts to the laboratory analysis and preparation of reports,
based upon materials excavated during his field work of the past two
years. In addition, he has undertaken a reanalysis of certain pottery
collections that have been previously described in the literature to
bring them into accord with current concepts. A large site report,
“Molstad Village: A Fortified Site in the Oahe Reservoir, South
Dakota,” was completed in first draft, and a shorter paper reexamin-
ing a number of late prehistoric and early historic sites in the Mobridge
area, South Dakota, and an analysis of materials from the La Roche
sites are under way. Previous studies of Mr. Hoffman’s, published
104. ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

during the year, include “Temporal Ordering and the Chouteau
Aspect,” Plains Anthropologist, vol. 8, No. 20, pp. 91-97; “Prehistoric
Houses Along the Middle Missouri River,” Progress, Oct.—Dec., 1963,
Missouri Basin Field Committee, Billings, pp. 48-57; “Investigation
of the Swift Bird House (89DW233) in the Oahe Reservoir, South
Dakota,” Plains Anthropologist, vol. 8, No. 22, pp. 249-256; a field
report, “Excavations at Molstad Village in the Oahe Reservoir,”
Plains Anthropologist, vol. 8, No. 20, pp. 118-119; and two short book
reviews also published in the Plains Anthropologist.

Mr. Hoffman served as chairman of the 2014 Plains Conference at
Pierre on July 20, which he reported briefly in the Plains Anthro-
pologist, vol. 8, No. 22, p. 262. He also participated in the joint
Plains-Pecos meeting at Taos, N. Mex., September 6-7, where he pre-
sented a paper entitled, “ua Roche: Some New Data,” and attended
the annual meeting of the Montana Archeological Society at Havre,
May 16 and 17. He also spoke before several school and civic groups
in Nebraska and Iowa. At the end of the year Mr. Hoffman was
again in the field engaged in archeological excavations in the Big
Bend Reservoir of South Dakota.

Wilfred M. Husted, archeologist, when not in the field, prepared re-
ports, based upon materials excavated during his 1963 field investi-
gations, and continued to work on the backlog of site collections from
the Missouri Basin Project files. A manuscript report entitled
“Archeological Test Excavations at Fort Laramie National Historic
Site, Wyoming, 1963” was completed and accepted by the U.S. Na-
tional Park Service, Midwest Region. A final draft of “The Bice
Site (89LM31) and the Clarkstown Site (89L.M47) : Salvage Excava-
tions in the Fort Randall Reservoir, South Dakota” was completed,
and major drafts of three as yet untitled reports dealing with sites in
the Big Bend and Fort Randall Reservoirs are substantially finished.
Mr. Husted submitted two papers, “Early Occupation of the Colorado
Front Range” and “Pueblo Pottery from Northern Colorado,” for
publication, and two short reports, “Investigations in the Upper Yel-
lowtail Reservoir, Montana and Wyoming” and “A Rock Alignment
in the Colorado Front Range,” were published in the Plains Anthro-
pologist (vol. 8, No. 20, p. 119, and vol. 8, No. 22, pp. 221-224, respec-
tively). At the end of the year he was in the field excavating sites in
the Yellowtail Reservoir of Wyoming and Montana.

Richard E. Jensen, archeologist, when not in the field, worked
primarily on the analysis and reporting of site collections excavated by
staff members in previous years, but following the death of Dean E.
Clark, laboratory supervisor, he assumed direction of the processing
and cataloging staff in addition to his regular duties. He cooperated
with Dr. Caldwell in the preparation of a major study entitled, “The
SECRETARY’S REPORT 105

Grand Detour Phase: Early Village Sites in the Big Bend Reservoir,
South Dakota,” and completed a first draft of “The Peterson Site
(39LM215), An Earth Lodge Village in the Big Bend Reservoir.”
A study concerned with recent work in the Big Bend Reservoir, “A
Temporal Ordering of Several Rectangular House Occupations in
Central South Dakota” (abstract), was published in the Proceedings
of the 74th Annual Meeting of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences,
Lincoln, 1964, p. 4. On July 20, Mr. Jensen attended the 2014 Plains
Conference at Pierre, S. Dak., where he reported the progress of his
fieldwork. He also participated in the Plains-Pecos meeting at Taos,
N. Mex., presenting a brief paper entitled, “Notes on the Archeology of
the Big Bend Area.” At the end of the year he was in the field ex-
cavating at the Sommers site in the Big Bend Reservoir.

Oscar L. Mallory, archeologist, when not in the field, continued the
analysis and reporting of materials that he excavated or collected in
previous field seasons. A reconnaissance report, “An Archeological
Appraisal of the Missouri Breaks Region in Montana,” was completed
and issued for limited distribution, and a short note entitled “Survey of
the Missouri Breaks Region, Montana,” summarizing the work, was
published in the Plains Anthropologist (vol. 8, No. 20, p. 120). In
addition, Mr. Mallory completed a detailed study of the artifacts from
the Mouat Cliff Burials (24TE401), Mont., which will be a part of a
larger study of the excavations carried out by members of the Billings
Archeological Society. Another manuscript concerned with a group
of sites in the vicinity of the Moreau River, Oahe Reservoir, is well
under way. At the end of the year Mr. Mallory was in the field
excavating sites in the Oahe Reservoir.

Robert W. Neuman, archeologist, when not in the field, devoted most
of his time to the analysis and reporting of data resulting from his
excavations during previous field seasons. He has begun a major
monograph concerned with early burial mound complexes in the north-
ern Plains. He has also completed an article entitled “Projectile
Points from Preceramic Occupations near Fort Thompson, South
Dakota,” which has been accepted by the Plains Anthropologist, and,
in addition, a number of Mr. Neuman’s research papers, most of which
were written during the current year, were published. These include:
“Check-stamped Pottery on the Northern and Central Great Plains,”
American Antiquity, vol. 29, No. 1, 1963, pp. 17-26; “Field Work in
Dewey County, South Dakota, Oahe Reservoir Area,” Plains Anthro-
pologist, vol. 8, No. 20, pp. 121-122; “Archeological Salvage Investi-
gations in the Lovewell Reservoir Area, Kansas,” iver Basin Surveys

Bulletin 189, pp. 291-318.

Mr. Neuman attended the 2014 Plains Conference in Pierre, S. Dak.,
July 20, the annual meeting of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences,
Lincoln, May 1 and 2, and the meeting of the Society for American
Archeology, Chapel Hill, N.C., May 7-9, where he presented a paper
on “A Woodland Camp and Burial Mound Complex in Dewey County,
South Dakota.” He continued to serve as chairman of the Radiocar-
bon Section of the Missouri Basin Chronolgy Program, was appointed
assistant editor for current research (Plains area) for American
Antiquity, and contributing editor for Plains facts for the Plains An-
thropologist. Mr. Neuman participated in the Visiting Scientist Pro-
gram of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences, speaking before school
groups at Eddyville, Nebr., and he also presented an illustrated talk
to the National Professional Geographical Fraternity at the Univer-
sity of Nebraska. At the end of the year Mr. Neuman was at work in
the Lincoln laboratory.

G. Hubert Smith, archeologist, when not in the field, was concerned
with the preparation of reports based upon his previous work at several
historic sites. By the end of the year he had completed a comprehen-
sive report on investigations by the Missouri Basin Project and the
State Historical Society of North Dakota at the sites of Like-A-
Fishhook Village and Fort Berthold I and II (832M1L2), in the Garri-
son Reservoir area, North Dakota. In addition, he had made
substantial progress on reports of excavations of Fort George
(39ST202) and 39HU301, in the Big Bend Reservoir of South Dakota
and had begun preparation (with Caldwell and others) of the booklet
“The Big Bend Reservoir: Archeology and History,” to be published
by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. An article written by Mr.
Smith, “Archeological Explorations at Fort McHenry, 1958,” was
published in the Maryland Historical Magazine (vol. 58, No. 3, pp.
247-250), and a brief note, “Excavations at Fort George, South Da-
kota,” appeared in the Plains Anthropologist (vol. 8, No. 20, p. 122).

On July 20 he took part in discussions of northern Plains ethnohis-
tory, at the 2014 Plains Conference at Pierre,S. Dak. At the Plains-
Pecos meeting at Taos, N. Mex., on September 6 and 7, he reported
recent investigations at historic sites within the Missouri Basin reser-
voirareas. During the period October 24-30 he examined historic sites
in Missouri at the request of Dr. Carl H. Chapman and other Univer-
sity of Missouri staff members. On October 28 Mr. Smith addressed
the annual meeting of the Missouri Archeological Society at Colum-
bia, Mo., and that evening spoke before the Big Bend chapter of the
SECRETARY’S REPORT 107

Society at Marshall, Mo. On April 10, he presented an illustrated
lecture, “Archeological Salvage within the Missouri Basin,” before the
annual meeting of the Minnehaha County Historical Society at Sioux
Falls, S. Dak., and on May 2 he read a paper entitled “The Viking Site
in Newfoundland” before the anthropological section of the Nebraska
Academy of Sciences (published in abstract in the Proceedings of the
74th Annual Meeting of the Nebraska Academy of Sciences, Lincoln,
p.5). In April Mr. Smith became contributing editor for reviews for
the Plains Anthropologist. At the end of the year he was at work in
the Lincoln Laboratory of the Missouri Basin Project.

Virginia—Carl F. Miller, at the beginning of the fiscal year, had an
excavation crew at work on the Hales Ford site (44F R14) in the Smith
Mountain Reservoir area near Rocky Mount in southern Virginia. He
completed the work at this site on July 2, having excavated 144 arche-
ological features and recovered various tool types, burial patterns and
offerings, and, of particular interest, a series of bone flutes that sug-
gested much in the way of social life of these Early to Middle Wood-
land Indians. The power screen was used during these excavations,
making possible a nearly complete recovery of the cultural remains.

Mr. Miller and his crew of five men moved to the Booth Farm site
(44FR15) on July 2, and between then and July 28, when the field
work ended, they excavated 202 archeological features. A number of
Savannah projectile points of the Late Archaic and Early Woodland
Periods were found lying on sterile hardpan at the base of the site and
in association with several random post molds. Noteworthy were the
remains of 70 feet of stockade found at the south edge of the site. In
this stockade, posts had been placed at intervals and reinforced with
rocks in the postholes. Wooden stringers had connected the vertical
posts, and to these had been attached other posts, much as a modern
fence would be built.

Idaho-Oregon.—Under an agreement with the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, the Idaho State University Museum continued the work on the
Hells Canyon Reservoir material that was excavated during the latter
part of last fiscal year. The project, under the direction of Dr. Earl
H. Swanson, director of the Museum, was continued by Max G. Pavesic,
a graduate student at the University of Colorado. Work was confined
largely to laboratory analysis of the excavated material, rechecking a
few of the field locations, and preparation of the report.

ARCHIVES

Mrs. Margaret C. Blaker continued her duties as archivist, assisted
until August 1 by Regina M. Solzbacher and for the remainder of the
fiscal year by Margaret V. Lee.

An extensive series of photographic prints and lantern slides, made
108 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

in the 1880’s and 1890’s and showing Indian students at Hampton
Institute, as well as views made on a number of western reservations,
was borrowed from the Huntington Memorial Library of Hampton
Institute, Hampton, Va. Approximately 400 copy negatives were
made from this loan collection and are now in the Bureau’s active files.

Over 150 photographs of Osage Indians, including many full-length
portraits of individuals in native costume taken in the 1880’s and
1890’s in the studios of G. W. Parsons and J. M. Fowler of Paw-
huska, Okla., were received on loan from the Osage Tribal Museum,
Pawhuska, Okla. in May and are currently being copied.

Approximately 100 glass plate negatives exposed by Dr. Robert
Charles Gebhardt in the period 1900-1907, showing Indians on the
streets of Black River Ralls, Wis., and their homes and burial
grounds near the cranberry marshes outside the town, were acquired
from the photographer’s son, Paul Gebhardt of Towson, Md.

Thirty photographs of Florida Seminole Indians, and Seminole
camps, boats, and agricultural scenes, made in 1910-11 by Lorenzo
D. Creel, special agent, were copied from Creel’s manuscript report
in the National Archives.

Thirteen studio and outdoor photographs of Winnebago Indians
taken in the period from the 1870’s to about 1900 by H. H. Bennett,
pioneer photographer of Kilbourn, Wis., now Wisconsin Dells, were
acquired from the Bennett Studio in Wisconsin Dells. This studio
and its files of glass negatives of persons, places, and events in the
Wisconsin Dells area in the period 1865 to 1907 is now maintained by
the photographer’s daughters, Miss Miriam Bennett and Mrs. Ruth
Bennett Dyer.

Three original prints from negatives made about 1899 in the vicinity
of Chadron, Nebr., by Ed Edson were received from Dr. R. W. Breck-
inridge, through the Lincoln, Nebr., office of the River Basin Surveys.
They are portraits of Red Cloud and Little Wound, Oglala Dakotas,
and a view of a Sioux camp near Chadron, Nebr.

Individual portraits of five Sioux Indians, taken in 1899 by Robert
Gish Parker of Chicago, were donated by a nephew of the photog-
rapher, Mr. Leslie B. Taylor of Miami, Fla. The photographs in-
clude a portrait of the famous show Indian, Iron Tail.

Four negatives made by Dr. Francis Harper on the Poosepatuck
Reservation, Mastic, Long Island, in 1909 were donated by Dr. Harper
and filed with related negatives previously donated by him.

A group of 10 photographic reproductions on postcards were
donated by Philip Sampson of Arlington, Va. They included a full-
length portrait as well as front and profile bust portraits of the Kaw
(Kansa) chief Washunga, taken about 1880.

Eugene Heflin of Reedsport, Oreg., submitted an account of his
SECRETARY'S REPORT 109

attempts to salvage skeletons and artifacts from the site of the historic
village of Shet-le-shin, on Pistol River, southwest Oregon. This site
has now been destroyed by road construction. A microfilm copy of
Mr. Heflin’s account, which included news clippings, photographs and
pen-and-ink drawings, was made and the original returned to him.

A Micmac vocabulary and grammatical notes recorded by P. L.
Muschamp while he was a graduate student at Yale University were
deposited by Mr. Muschamp. Unfortunately Mr. Muschamp’s more
extensive notes on his Micmac fieldwork had been lost in a fire that
destroyed his home a number of years ago. These notes are on 3X5’”
slips and occupy one file box.

Report on the National Zoological Park

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ended June 30,

1964:
BIRTHS

One of the most beautiful animals in the Zoo is Mohini of Rewa,
the so-called white tiger. With her cream-colored coat, striped with
varying hues of gray to black, her ice-blue eyes, her great size and
majestic mien, she has been an extremely popular exhibit since her
arrival in 1960. Her mate, Samson, is a normal-colored tiger but
comes from the same strain and hence carries the genes for whiteness.
Mated to a white female, he could be expected to sire white cubs.

On January 6, 1964, three young were born to the pair; one white,
the other two orange. Through the courtesy of Metromedia, a closed-
circuit television was installed, and the actual birth of the cubs was
witnessed by members of the Zoo staff on a monitor placed in the
vestibule of the lion house. Until the cubs were 6 weeks old the lion
house was closed to the public. Zoo visitors could, however, watch
the little family on either one of two television screens. Mohini
proved to be an exceptional mother; she took the greatest care of her
cubs, and all three, now weaned, are thriving. When they were first
put on exhibition they were so popular that it was necessary to put
a sign on the cage asking visitors to move on and let others enjoy the
scene; some people actually arrived in the morning and spent the en-
tire day standing in front of the cage until the building closed in the
evening. A film of the birth, combined with a film made at the
palace of the Maharajah of Rewa in India, was shown on a half-hour
nationwide television program.

For many years, the National Zoological Park was famous for its
success in breeding pygmy hippopotamuses. Then the old male died,
and it was several years before a replacement for him could be secured.
In 1960 President William V. S. Tubman of Liberia donated a male
pygmy hippo, which has now sired seven offspring, three of them
within the past year. Two Nile hippopotamuses were also born at
the National Zoo this year.

On September 9, 1961, the first gorilla to be bred and born at the
National Zoological Park arrived, the offspring of Moka and

Nikumba, lowland gorillas. The baby was named Tomoka and was
successfully reared by the wife of Keeper Bernard M. Gallagher.
Moka’s first pregnancy was carefully watched, and the birth of the
baby was eagerly anticipated. After her pregnancy, like some human
mothers, she began to put on weight, and although her diet was care-
fully supervised she continued to gain. This, and the fact that the
male gorilla suffered an attack of paralysis in June 1963 (see p. 143),
account for her second baby, Leonard, arriving as something of a
surprise package on January 10, 1964. Leonard, like his brother, is
being raised in Keeper Gallagher’s home and gives every evidence of
being a normal, healthy young gorilla.

Four more calves were born to the Dorcas gazelles, increasing the
number of these graceful little animals to a herd of eight. The
original pair were gifts from President Habib Bourguiba of Tunisia
in 1960.

Other interesting additions were two hybrids between a male cotton-
top marmoset (Saguinus oedipus) and a female red-handed tamarin
(S. midas), born on February 19. The babies closely resemble their
mother, lacking the white pompadour of the cottontop.

Following the procedure of previous years, all births and hatchings
are listed below, whether or not the young were successfully reared.
In many instances, the record of animals having bred in captivity is
of interest.

More than a year ago the Government of Assam, India, offered the
National Zoological Park a female rhinoceros as a mate for Tarun,
the male rhino that came to the Zoo in May 1960. An adult female
was secured from the Kazirangi Game Reserve, and negotiations
began to transport her from India to Washington. Then it was dis-
covered that “Deepali” was pregnant, and all plans for her trip to
the United States were held in abeyance until her calf was born. In
April 1963 she produced a female calf, subsequently named Rajkumari,
and it was necessary to wait until the young one was weaned. In
October Associate Director J. Lear Grimmer and Mrs. Grimmer went
to India to arrange transportation for the huge animal. They found,
to their delight, that the Indian Government was including the baby
in the generous gift to the United States. Crates were built under
Mr. Grimmer’s supervision, and both animals were brought to the
zoo in Calcutta. No commercial airline could handle the shipment
(Deepali, crated, weighed 4,000 pounds). Fortunately a number of
planes from the American Air Force were in India at the time, par-
ticipating in joint Indo-Anglo-American air exercises, and through
the good offices of the then Vice President, Lyndon B. Johnson, who
was a Regent of the Smithsonian Institution, and Air Force Chief
of Staff Curtis LeMay, it was possible to load both animals on a
C-130 transport. The animals arrived December 17, and were un-
loaded at the elephant house at dusk. Only 11 days later Deepali
succumbed to an acute attack of gastroenteritis. This was a tragic
loss for the Zoo, but Rajkumari (the name means “princess”) has
adapted nicely to the Zoo regime, is eating well, gaining weight, and
of course is the most valuable single acquisition made by the Zoo
during the past year.

On February 12 the director left for Indonesia with gifts of whis-

tling swans, ducks, and geese from Attorney General Robert Kennedy
to President Sukarno of Indonesia. While there he accepted a most
generous gift from the Government of Indonesia of a pair of the
giant monitor lizards found on a few small islands in Indonesia and
known as Komodo dragons. The male was nearly 9 feet long and
weighed approximately 200 pounds; the female was about half that
size. Again, the Zoo was most unfortunate, as the big male, a truly
impressive specimen, died of systematic amebiasis on June 1, after
only 12 weeks and 4 days on exhibition at the Park. The female
has the same infestation with amebae, and every effort is being made
to cure her, as she is the only one of this species in the United States
at the present time.

year, but the following are of interest :

REPORT OF THE VETERINARIAN

Nikumba, the adult male gorilla, whose paraplegia was mentioned in
last year’s Report, made an essentially complete recovery in 8 months.
A tentative diagnosis was made of a selective spotty viral infection of
the spinal cord. Nikumba was treated daily for approximately 3
months. Chloromycetin succinate and Bejectal, a vitamin-B complex,
were injected intramuscularly, by the use of the projectile syringe and
the Cap-Chur gun. Methylprednisolone was given orally in Coca
Cola syrup. The most noteworthy progress was seen approximately
214 months after the onset of the paralytic attack when Nikumba was
able to stand erect and take two or three steps before returning to a
sitting position. His progress since that time has been slow and
steady; he has regained his original weight and is moving in a normal
manner.

One of the most interesting things that occurred during the treat-
ment period was the gorilla’s reaction to the use of the Cap-Chur gun
equipment. One could enter the room with empty hands and Nikumba
would come to the bars with a desire to hold your arm or your hand,
and displayed every evidence of affection. As soon as the equipment
was produced, however, Nikumba would retreat to a far corner of the
cage or climb to the top of the shift cage. He became very nervous
and would swing from the horizontal bars in the cage to escape the
administration of the medication. Immediately following the injec-
tion Nikumba would realize that the treatment had been completed
and would then come forward to the bars and display his normal
friendliness.

His recovery has been observed with a great deal of interest because
he is not only an excellent specimen of the male lowland gorilla but
also a proven sire. The first baby, Tomoka, was born on September
9, 1961. Leonard, a second male, was born on January 10, 1964. The
last observed mating of the parent gorillas took place on April 24 and
25, 1963, approximately 2 months before the onset of the paraplegia of
the breeding male. It has been necessary for both babies to be raised
by the wife of a keeper, since Moka had no milk following either birth.
The entire staff is anxiously awaiting Moka’s return to a regular
menstrual cycle to observe Nikumba’s ability to mate following his
paralysis.

On December 16, 1963, Deepali, an adult Indian rhinoceros and her
baby were received by air from India. Eleven days following the
arrival symptoms of an intestinal colic were noted in the adult at 1
p-m., and death occurred at 9 o’clock that evening. An immediate
autopsy was performed and the cause of death was found to be a per-
acute hemorrhagic gastroenteritis. Approximately 4 liters of free
blood were found in the stomach and the anterior portion of the small
144 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

intestine. This problem was further complicated by the presence of
a large number of fringed and diphyllobothrium tapeworms and in-
testinal flukes, as well as numerous strongyloides. Treatment was
instituted immediately to relieve the parasitic infestation of the baby
rhino, Rajkumari, with excellent results, and her growth has been
quite satisfactory.

On March 4, 1964, the director of the National Zoological Park
returned from Djakarta, Indonesia, with a pair of Komodo dragons
(Varanus komodoensis). The male dragon was 8 feet 11 inches long
and weighed approximately 200 pounds. The smaller female was 6
feet long and weighed 75 pounds. The first fecal samples harvested
following their arrival revealed a heavy infestation of protozoa with
ameboid-like nuclei. On May 21 the large dragon became affected
with severe gastric cramps which were relieved by the injection of
atropine sulfate, but it died the next day. An intensive autopsy was
performed, and the cause of death was established as intestinal and
extraintestinal amebiasis. Histopathological sections were made from
tissues harvested during the autopsy. Outstanding degeneration was
noted in the liver, in which no functional tissue could be found; it
consisted entirely of a mass of ameboid-like cysts. This has been
reported only once in literature and much more extensive studies are
being conducted by the veterinary division in cooperation with the
Parasitology Department of George Washington University Medical
School and the staff of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology to
determine the incidence of such liver cyst occurrence in our available
lizards.

With the assistance of Dr. Thomas Sappington, an internal medicine
specialist in Washington, a research program is being developed in
the incidence and extent of tissue damage caused by amebae in lizards.
This will include a study of the blood picture, parasite history, and
possible liver damage caused by amebiasis in the monitor lizard.

A 6-day treatment of the female Komodo dragon consisted of re-
tention enemas of 200 cc. of physiological saline, containing 650 mg.
of diodoquin, and intramuscular injections of 500 mg. of tetracycline.
In the meantime, tests were being conducted on Varanus salvator to
determine the lizard’s tolerance of 0.0325 mg. of intramuscular emetine
hydrochloride as an effort to arrest the extraintestinal amebiasis. This
test continued for 6 days with no apparent side effects. After estab-
lishing the safety of the drug, the Komodo dragon then received the
same dosage. The results were a marked reduction in the number of
amebae and flagellates in the stool.

Studies are continuing in the hope of finding a more satisfactory
parasiticide for use in various species of mammals, birds, and reptiles.
Ambutochloride has been used in canines, as well as reptiles; thiaben-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 145

dazole has been used in equines, rhinoceroses, tapirs, and several mon-
keys; and a research product, called Alcopar, which contains the
bephenium ion, shows a great deal of promise in selected species of
animals. To generalize, thiabendazole has been the first product we
have used in the zebras that has been so thorough that routine worm-
ing has become unnecessary; and the use of Alcopar in the large cats
has caused a reduction in the egg count of both ascarid and hookworm.

Bird losses on the shipment arriving from India on December 16
were high, owing primarily to travel trauma. Among 69 waterfowl
and pheasants quarantined at Clifton, N.J., 8 undiagnosed deaths
occurred. Psittacine birds are required to be quarantined for a period
of 90 days under the direction of the U.S. Public Health Service, and
101 birds were placed in a closed quarantine area. Quarantine pro-
cedure consists of 45 days on tetracycline-treated seeds, and a further
45-day period of observation. Of the quarantined birds, 48 died and
were sent to the Communicable Disease Center. Psittacosis virus was
isolated in some of the birds.

Every effort is being made to improve the effectivness of the veteri-
nary division in the care of animal health in the Park. X-ray equip-
ment purchased early in the year has been invaluable in the correction
of several fractures. Equipment and supplies have been obtained to
institute a system of bacteriological culturing in both living animals
and autopsy specimens in an effort to establish the cause of death more
definitely, and diagnose illnesses and infections in the living animals
more rapidly.

The veterinary division has been fortunate in having the cooperation
and assistance of various specialists in the fields of clinical investiga-
tion and medicine. Among these men were Dr. Henry Feffer, ortho-
pedist ; Dr. Hugo Rizzoli, neurosurgeon; Dr. A. G. Karlsen of the Mayo
Clinic in Rochester, Minn.; Dr. F. R. Lucas, director of the Livestock
Sanitary Laboratory in Centerville, Md.; Dr. Anthony Morris of the
National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Md.; and Dr. Leonard
Marcus and staff, of the Armed Forces Institute of Pathology. Dr.
Clarence Hartman, Dr. William McCarten, and Miss Bessie Sonnen-
berg, parasitologists on the staff of George Washington Medical
School, connected with the Tropical Disease Program, have given
assistance in the diagnosis of and identification of the parasites that
we have encountered in the Zoo, and their advice on treatment has been
most helpful.

A Brahminy kite (Haliastwr indus) collected for the National
Zoological Park by the National Geographic Society-Smithsonian
Institution Expedition to the East Indies, received September 28, 1937,
died on April 18, 1964. This bird had been in the collection 26 years
5 months 21 days.

RESEARCH

The National Zoological Park is expanding its scope in the field of
animal behavioral studies to programs designed to develop a greater
knowledge of animal husbandry as it applies to worldwide conserva-
tion efforts.

All possible efforts and means must immediately be turned to the
task of preserving representative fauna from all parts of the world.
International and national organizations of zoos and wildlife con-
servators do consonantly strive to preserve those species which are
threatened in the countries of habitat. To foster and breed such
species is a task well within the capabilities of the zoos and conserva-
tion societies of the world. It remains only to know enough about
these vanishing animals to recreate at least minimum niches which
may result in reversal and establishment of breeding units. To this
end the National Zoological Park is participating and cooperating in
the following projects:

Group relationships and social niches of the Barbary ape, A/acaca
sylvanus; investigators, Dr. R. K. Lahiri, Director Alipore Zoo, Cal-
cutta, India, and Dr. Charles Southwick, Director, School of Bio-
medicine, Johns Hopkins University.

Social behavior of titi monkeys, Callicebus ; investigator, Dr. Martin
Moynihan, Canal Zone Biological Area, Balboa, Panama.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 147

Ecology and behavior of Suncus murinus; investigator, Dr. Kyle
Barbehenn. This work is continuing with emphasis on captive be-
havior at the National Zoological Park.

The arrangement and structure of the genetic complex in wild
animals is an active project in which the National Zoological Park
is contributing culture bases to Dr. Kurt Benirschke, department of
genetics, Dartmouth University. A great deal of information, which
should lead to better understanding of breeding programs, is
anticipated.

The National Zoological Park will continue to devote, within the
organization, as much time and effort as possible to increase the knowl-
edge of the requirements of wild animals both captive and free. To
this end, the zoo plans, at the first opportunity, to activate a section
of Animal Research and Behavior.

VISITORS

The 16th International Congress of Zoology was held in Washington
from August 20 to 26, and many of the delegates visited the National
Zoo. On the night of August 20 approximately 2,000 were taken on
a night tour and served refreshments. Members of the American
Association of Zoological Parks and Aquariums, meeting in Wash-
ington from September 23 to 26, visited the Park frequently and on
September 24 were taken on a late-afternoon tour of the Zoo. The
annual meeting of the Virginia Herpetological Society was held in
the reptile house on December 28 and was attended by 62 members.
On June 6, 1964, the same society met again in the reptile house and
heard an illustrated lecture on the snakes of Taiwan, given by Dr. R.
E. Kuntz.

About 2 p.m. each day the cars then parked in the Zoo are counted
and listed according to the State or country from which they come.
This is, of course, not a census of the cars coming to the Zoo but is
valuable in showing the percentage of attendance by States of people
in private automobiles. Many District of Columbia, Maryland, and
Virginia cars come to the Zoo to bring guests from other States. The
tabulation for fiscal year 1964 is as follows:

Puerto Rico, Thailand, and Turkey. On the days of even small at-
tendance there are cars parked in the Zoo from at least 15 States,
Territories, the District of Columbia, and foreign countries.

Owing to the construction work in progress in the Zoo in connection
with the redevelopment program, the number of available parking
spaces fluctuates between 650 and 1,100.

PERSONNEL

Eppie Bell was transferred from the Smithsonian Institution to
become maintenance general foreman of the National Zoological Park
on May 24, 1964. John Monday, transferred from the District of
Columbia Government Water Department, was appointed gardener
foreman on March 15, 1964. Wilbur Banner, formerly with the Navy
Department in Norfolk, Va., was appointed mason lead foreman on
December 31, 1962.

During the year only three employees left the Zoo. Dr. W. T. Roth,
general curator since August 7, 1961, resigned on June 30, 1964. Pvt.
George McLeod, a member of the police force since September 1, 1928,
retired on December 31, 1963. Lt. Earl King, appointed to the police
force on August 4, 1944, retired because of disability on January 14,
1964.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 149

The director attended the annual meeting of the International Union
of Directors of Zoological Gardens in Chester, England, from Septem-
ber 9 to 13. At the annual conference of the American Association of
Zoological Parks and Aquariums, held in Washington September 23
to 26, the director was elected president of the Association. He
attended the meetings of the executive board of the American Institute
of Park Executives, held in New York January 17 to 20, and a com-
mittee meeting of the AAZPA in New York on February 7. From
October 30 to November 3, he was in Sumter, S.C., as consultant to
city officials who plan to build a zoo in that city. On May 17, he was
present at the dedication of a new feline house in City Park Zoo,
Denver, Colo., and on the following 3 days he attended the Western
Regional Zoo Conference in Salt Lake City, Utah. On June 21 he
left for London, England, as a delegate to a symposium on the role of
ZOOS in animal conservation. Following the conference in London he
visited zoos in Munich, Turin, and Barcelona.

The director gave three radio talks and made three television appear-
ances. He addressed the College Park (Md.) Rotary Club and also
spoke at a meeting of the D.C. Veterinary Medical Association.

J. Lear Grimmer, associate director, on January 20 made a sound
film to be broadcast in India over the Voice of America. On April 3
he gave a half-hour talk over WETA~-TV, an educational channel, and
on June 27 appeared on a film for the U.S. Information Agency. He
spoke on a radio program about new animals at the Zoo (June 10) and
addressed the Virginia Herpetological Society on June 6. While in
India he had an opportunity to visit zoos in Delhi, Calcutta, and
Guahati, as well as wildlife sanctuaries in Assam and in Sundarbans
bordering the Bay of Bengal. On May 14 and 15 he attended meet-
ings of the Inland Field Conference at the National Science Founda-
tion, Washington, D.C.

In June Travis E. Fauntleroy, assistant to the director, visited zoos
in Buffalo, Detroit, Milwaukee, Chicago, Indianapolis, Cincinnati,
Columbus, Toledo, and Cleveland, observing children’s zoos in particu-
lar and management operations in general.

Keeper H. Stroman appeared on a television program for the U.S.
Information Agency on May 18, showing a European brown bear cub
and a baby pygmy hippopotamus.

In the fiscal year 1964 the Zoo had 211 authorized positions: office of
the director, 11; operations and maintenance department, which in-
cludes the mechanical division, police division, grounds division, and
services division, 122; animal department, 77 (an increase of 1 night
keeper) ; and scientific research department, 1.
150 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964
POLICE DIVISION

Alterations to the topography of the Park during the past year
created problems for the Zoo police, but they have made the necessary
adjustments to meet the changes in flow of traffic, congested areas,
dangerous locations, and changed sites of parking lots.

Four new members joined the force to replace men who retired or
transferred. A new police cruiser replaced the old one, and two more
horses were acquired for patrolling remote parts of the Park. Addi-
tional walkie-talkie sets facilitate direct communication between men
working in widely scattered locations.

The police locker room and improved kitchen facilities were relo-
cated to eliminate congestion in the police station and add to the
comfort of the division.

AFGE Lodge No. 185 was recognized by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion as the official bargaining agent in disputes and discussion between
the police department and management.

Eight letters of commendation were received, citing various officers
for the courtesy, kindness, and assistance to the public.

Twenty-five officers qualified on the pistol range. The division now
has seven experts, nine sharpshooters, and nine marksmen.

Lieutenant Wolfe attended the President’s Conference on Occupa-
tional Safety. Captain Brink attended a seminar on management
and employee relations, held at the Civil Service Commission. Lt. D.
B. Bell conducted a refresher course in law enforcement. Sgt. A. L.
Canter and Pvt. D. R. Bowman held classes in first aid.

During the year at the Zoo there were 1,501 traffic violations, 131
juvenile arrests, 62 criminal arrests, 106 truant children, 295 lost chil-
dren, 535 minor first-aid cases, and 47 serious first-aid cases. A total
of 9,395 visitors asked for information or assistance at the police
station.

Through the efforts of Lieutenant Wolfe, blood procurement officer,
38 pints of blood were donated to the Red Cross Blood Bank. Thirty-
seven pairs of eyeglasses, found and unclaimed, were donated to the
D.C. Chapter of the Society for the Prevention of Blindness; 12 bags
of clothing and miscellaneous articles, found and unclaimed, were
turned over to Goodwill Industries.

Nine groups of handicapped children and 11 busloads of patients
from St. Elizabeth’s Hospital were escorted through the Zoo by var-
lous police officers throughout the year. On May 9 a total of 7,378
School Safety Patrol children, transported in 190 buses, visited the
Park after the annual parade. Buses were parked and dispersed
efficiently by the police in the limited parking areas available.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 151
MAINTENANCE, CONSTRUCTION, AND GROUNDS

The mechanical division has the responsibility for the maintenance
and repair of the buildings and facilities of the National Zoological
Park. This responsibility is met by the heating and ventilating sec-
tion and by the building section which, in addition to continuing
maintenance, constructs new shelters, paddocks, and cages for the
animals,

Considerable work was done on the monkey house this year. The
wooden partitions and floors in the inside cages were rebuilt, new
shifting doors installed, and inside and outside cages painted. New
doors were built and installed at the building’s entrance. The reloca-
tion of the Connecticut Avenue-Harvard Street road necessitated the
installation of fences for visitor safety and animal protection. The
small stone house for hoofed stock, back of the small mammal house,
was remodeled to make it suitable for camels. One of the large alliga-
tor cages on the north end of the reptile house was remodeled and
now is provided with radiant heat in the floor to make it more com-
fortable for the Komodo dragon. The small waterfowl] pond behind
the main bear line was remodeled as an exhibit area for the Komodo
dragon and the Malayan monitors during the summer months.

Plumbers, electricians, carpenters, and painters are constantly at
work keeping the old buildings in a decent state of repair. One of
the year’s tasks was to build a crate for a full-grown giraffe.

Work of the grounds division included the planting of 107 trees
(some of them flowering), 63 shrubs, 78 evergreens, and various bulbs
and annuals. These were planted along the new road, on banks near
the shop, and throughout the Zoo lawns. Other projects included
seeding new areas where contractors had been working on the road;
seeding of deer paddocks, which had never before had grass; making
several new flowerbeds; renewing the soil and preparing a special me-
dium for the Komodo dragon’s outdoor cage; gathering forage and
grass clippings for animal food; filling in holes in lawns and walk-
ways; and cutting of perches desired for birds and animals. The
ground division also cut back branches overhanging bridle paths and
cleared horse trails along the fence line; removed dead wood from
195 trees over walks, roads, and public areas; felled 92 trees that were
dead or in bad condition; cut 49 unsightly stumps from Zoo lawns
with the aid of a stump chipper borrowed from the U.S. Army,
Cameron Station, Va.; moved snow and ice from sidewalks and build-
ing steps; sprayed bees’ nests to protect the public from stings; and
helped other departments in the Zoo with the Skyworker. Gifts of
plants were received from the District Waterworks, Botanical Gar-
den, Bureau of Standards, Glendale Nursery, Walter Reed Hospital,
Naval Hospital, St. Elizabeth’s Hospital, and the management of
the annual Flower and Garden Show.
152 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964
INFORMATION AND EDUCATION

The major activity of the information-education department was the
continuation of signing and relabeling. During the year a total of
457 animal identification labels were completed; since the program
began in October 1962, a total of eight buildings and units of the Zoo
have been relabeled—the puma house, main bear dens, short bear line
and ring cages, elephant house, reptile house, lion house, beaver valley,
and all outdoor hoofed stock. Also produced were 221 supporting
informational signs (safety signs, building signs, directional maps,
etc.) and 131 other visual information projects such as maps, charts,
and graphs. Four scale models were produced in conjunction with
the renovation plans for the Zoo. The mechanical department as-
sisted in framing and erecting the information signs on cages and
exhibits throughout the Park.

Additional department activities during the year included dissemi-
nation of animal information by telephone and correspondence,
library maintenance, and five special guided tours for groups of handi-
capped children, visiting schools and colleges, and foreign guests.
Two such groups of interest were delegates of the Foreign Museum
Professionals, sponsored by the American Association of Museums in
cooperation with the Department of State, and children from the
United Cerebral Palsy of Northern Virginia.

To study educational programs, labeling-exhibit techniques, and
children’s zoos, the zoologist visited zoos, aquariums, and museums in
Texas (Dallas and Fort Worth), Arizona (Tucson), and California
(San Diego, Los Angeles, and San Francisco), from October 27 to
November 13. From May 20 to May 28, the zoologist toured zoos
and museums in Atlanta, Ga., and Tampa and Miami, Fla., for the

The National Zoological Park’s safety subcommittee consists of
Lt. John R. Wolfe, chairman; Capt. C. E. Brink, police division;
F. M. Dellar, administration office; Bert J. Barker, animal depart-
ment; Reily Straw, maintenance and construction; John Monday,
grounds department; and Mrs. W. M. Holden, secretary. Monthly
meetings were held to suggest, discuss, and make recommendations to
the director on safety improvements.

The safety subcommittee is constantly on the alert for dangers that
might arise due to the construction program. Three contractors are
working on separate projects at the present time. Committee mem-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 153

bers are also vigilant in seeing that previous recommendations for
safety measures are carried out.

Safety precautions taken included paving 600 feet of sidewalk, re-
pairing potholes in roadways, installation of handrails at front and
rear entrances of administration building, extending the step on the
loading platform at the shop, and putting guards on power mowers.

FINANCES

Funds for the operation of the National] Zoological Park are appro-
priated annually under the District of Columbia Appropriation Act.
The operation and maintenance appropriation for the fiscal year 1964
totaled $1,597,356, which was $127,156 more than for the preceding
year. The increase consisted of $25,010 to cover salary increases for
general-schedule employees in accordance with Public Law 87-793;
$43,260 to cover salary increases for wage-board employees; $18,560
for within-grade salary advancements for both general-schedule and
wage-board employees; $21,030 to cover costs of reallocations; $8,750
for annualization of five positions established in fiscal year 1963;
$4,841 to employ temporary police; $3,505 to establish one position
for one-half of the year; $1,200 for miscellaneous supplies; and $1,000
for the purchase of new equipment.

Of the total appropriation, 84.5 percent ($1,349,407) was used for
salaries and related personnel costs, and 15.5 percent ($247,949) for
the maintenance and operation of the Zoo. Included in the latter fig-
ure were $85,150 for animal food ; $23,700 for fuel for heating; $24,188
for materials for building construction and repairs; $12,473 for elec-
tricity; $12,119 for the purchase of animals; $6,933 for telephone,
postal, and telegraph services; and $7,660 for veterinarian equipment
and supplies. The balance of $75,726 in operational funds was ex-
pended for other items, including freight, sundry supplies, uniforms,
gasoline, road repairs, equipment replacement, and new equipment.

COOPERATION

At all times special efforts are made to maintain friendly contacts
with other Federal and State agencies, private concerns and individ-
uals, and scientific workers for mutual assistance. As a result, the
Zoo receives much help and advice and many valuable animals, and in
turn it furnishes information and, whenever possible, animals it does
not need.

Special acknowledgement is due William Taback and John Pulaski,
in the office of the Dispatch Agent in New York City, and Stephen E.
Lato, Dispatch Agent in San Francisco, who are frequently called
upon to clear shipments of animals coming from abroad, often at times
of personal inconvenience.
154 | ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

When it is necessary to quarantine animals coming into this country,
they are taken to the U.S. Department of Agriculture’s station in
Clifton, N.J. During the past year Dr. H. A. Waters and Andy
Goodel, two of the officials stationed there, were most cooperative in
keeping the National Zoological Park informed as to the well-being
of animals and birds being held there for quarantine.

Animals that die in the Zoo are offered to the U.S. National Museum.
If the Museum does not need them, either as study specimens or as ex-
hibits, they are sent on request to research workers in other institutions.
Specialists at the Museum are always willing to be of help in identify-
ing rare specimens acquired at the Zoo.

The National Zoological Park cooperated with the National Capital
Parks and lent small animals to Park naturalists and to the Nature
Center in Rock Creek Park for demonstration. A Taiwan cobra was
lent to the New England Aquarium in Boston, Mass., for a television
showing.

FRIENDS OF THE NATIONAL ZOO

The Board of Governors of the Friends of the National Zoo, at their
regular monthly meeting in April, passed the following resolution:

Resolved: That the Board of Governors of the Friends of the National Zoo does
hereby designate the Society’s primary purpose and function to be the encourage-
ment of a broader zoological interest and knowledge, formed particularly in the
National Zoological Park. To achieve this goal, we propose that the Society pro-
mote the development of an educational service which would utilize all effective
contemporary media.

Therefore, the President is authorized to establish an Educational Steering
Committee, not necessarily limited in membership to present members of the
Society, which would formulate and recommend to the Board programs designed
to achieve these above-mentioned ends.

Since the 10-year program of capital improvements is so well under
way, physically and financially, it was felt that the urgency of work-
ing in behalf of the physical rehabilitation of the Zoo was no longer
great, and that the Friends could turn their energies toward develop-
ing various programs aimed at increasing and strengthening the edu-
cational potential of the National Zoological Park.

In March of this year the Friends published the first issue of their
newsletter, called Spots and Stripes, which elicited much favorable
comment. Present plans are for it to be published quarterly. The
Zoo has long felt the need for this sort of publication, and staff mem-
bers were glad to cooperate with the Friends in getting out the first
two issues.

The annual Zoo Night was held on June 12, 1964. Approximately
250 members, with their families, were taken on a tour of the buildings,
which were illuminated for the evening.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 155
CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

Money in this year’s Smithsonian Institution Appropriation Act
amounted to $1,275,000 for the capital improvement program at the
National Zoological Park. A portion of this is being used for the ad-
vance planning of the multiclimate house and aquatic mammal exhibit,
preliminary studies of the sewage system, and detailed planning for
the Connecticut Avenue entrance, hardy hoofed-stock and delicate
hoofed-stock enclosures, and additional parking lots. A portion of the
remainder is being used to construct new deer pens and new parking
lots near the Connecticut Avenue entrance. The balance will be com-
bined with fiscal 1965 money to construct the hardy hoofed-stock and
delicate hoofed-stock exhibits. A portion of the money was used to
build an incinerator between the shop and the heating plant. Con-
struction of the Connecticut Avenue entrance and the hardy hoofed-
stock exhibit have been combined with the delicate hoofed steck in 1965
because of delays in design due to refinements and improvements sug-
gested by the Fine Arts Commission.

During this fiscal year work continued on the remodeling of the
birdhouse and construction of a new flight cage. It is hoped that con-
struction will be finished and the house stocked and opened to the pub-
lic in late December or early January.

The relocation of the east-west access road from Connecticut Avenue
to Beach Drive was completed and opened to the public. The elephant
house parking lot is utilized by the visitors. Through traffic in the
center of the Zoo has been completely eliminated except for Zoo vehi-
cles. The removal of intrusive and dangerous automobile traffic has
created a more leisurely and parklike atmosphere in the heart of the
Zoo. As with any change, there have been some objections from the
public; however, it is gratifying that many more compliments have
been received than complaints.

The incinerator was constructed by the Edrow Engineering Co.
It is now possible for the National Zoological Park to destroy com-
pletely all combustible waste material on the Zoo grounds. A long-
standing source of embarrassingly poor housekeeping has been
eliminated.

National Capital Parks, Department of the Interior, has com-
pleted the first phase of the relocation of Beach Drive, which consists
of a tunnel under “Administration Hill,” retaining walls, a roadbed,
and new bridle trail on the east side of Rock Creek.

The Department of Sanitary Engineering of the District of Co-
lumbia installed a new 60-inch relief interceptor sewer beginning in
the Zoo downstream from the wolves, near “Purcell Rock,” and con-
tinuing along the west bank of the creek adjacent to an already existing
sewer line crossing Beach Drive within the Zoo just below the lower
156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

ford and continuing down through Rock Creek Park. This is part
of a program of sewage improvement of the District of Columbia.
Unfortunately the installation of such a large sewer necessitated the
removal of most of the trees along the west bank of Rock Creek, and
also the closing of the fords for many more days this year than is
normal.

At various times during the year there was construction going on
in five different areas of the Zoo. This caused some inconvenience to
visitors and necessitated changes in their parking and established
traffic patterns. These changes, however, were met with ready ac-
ceptance by the visiting public and a great deal of friendly interest
by local citizens.

There was a drop in the number of organized bus groups visiting
the Zoo because of the difficulty of parking buses during the con-
struction program.

All redevelopment work is being done under the direction of the
District of Columbia Department of Buildings and Grounds. Spe-
cial acknowledgment is due the director of that department and his
able staff.

Respectfully submitted.

Report on the Astrophysical Observatory

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1964:

DIVISION OF ASTROPHYSICAL RESEARCH

The Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory’s broad research pro-
gram* this past year embraced six major areas—planetary science,
meteoritic studies, cometary science, solar observation, stellar observa-
tion, and stellar theory. This division of the research program is
wholly arbitrary, and the six areas are strongly interrelated.

A recent work of the director of the Observatory is an example
of the amalgamation of several of these topics. For the 100th anni-
versary of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, held in Wash-
ington in October 1963, Dr. Whipple was invited to present a critical
summary on the history of the solar system. This lecture, consider-
ably expanded to present his interpretation of the present state of
theory of the evolution of the solar system, is now in press for the
Academy’s Proceedings. In preparing this summary, Dr. Whipple
reviewed critically a number of the processes visualized as opera-
tive in the earlier stages of the evolution of our solar system. In
the coming years Observatory scientists will expand their explorations
in these areas.

A strong feature of the Observatory’s scientific program is the ease
with which a scientist investigating a particular topic may draw on
experience and techniques generated by others pursuing different
topics. Thus the expertise developed by the Baker-Nunn network
for tracking satellites has been applied to an enlarged program of
comet and flare star observations.

Planetary sciences—With each year of mounting space activity,
the other planets seem less remote. Popular response and scientific
attention to planetary studies seem destined to increase as we approach
the ultimate objective of manned exploration. The current studies
of the earth, facilitated and stimulated by satellite observations, will
eventually be repeated for the other planets. At present these geo-

*Unless otherwise noted, research is supported from Federal funds appropriated to
Smithsonian Institution. ‘The Observatory, by paying scientists’ salaries, shares in the

support of all research. Support from outside sources is detailed in footnotes 1-17

158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

physical investigations predominate in the planetary research activ-
ities of the Observatory and much of the scientific community.

Scientists of the Observatory, using precise satellite-tracking data
from the network of Baker-Nunn cameras,’ investigate three major
geophysical topics: the detailed representation of the earth’s gravi-
tational field; the geometrical relation between points on the earth’s
surface; and the density and temperature of the upper atmosphere
and their variations. These topics are interrelated in a way that
requires that they be investigated concurrently. The director of the
Observatory is responsible for initiating the coordinated attack on
these problems and for monitoring their interaction with national and
international programs.

As a satellite moves in its orbit, the details of its motion reflect
the many irregularities in the gravitational field corresponding to the
nonuniform mass distribution within the earth. The gravitational
potential is conventionally represented mathematically as a series ex-
pansion in spherical harmonics. Imre G. Izsak has used a total of
26,447 precisely reduced Baker-Nunn observations of 11 objects to
obtain least-squares estimates for the coefficients of tesseral and sec-
torial harmonics of the geopotential.t. The method yields estimates
of geophysical significance for harmonics up to the sixth degree.
Evaluations of zonal-harmonics coefficients in the earth’s gravita-
tional potential up to the 14th order have been made by Dr. Y. Kozai,*
who used precisely reduced Baker-Nunn observations of 1959 a1, 1959
Eta, 1960 .2, 1961 Nu, 1961 o1 and 2, 1961 a1, and 1962 ae, inclina-
tions of which are between 28° and 95°.

A basic computer program used in all analyses of satellite motions
is the Differential Orbit Improvement program (DOI), which has
been extended by Mr. Izsak, M. J. Davies, and E. M. Gaposchkin
to incorporate the effects of the tesseral harmonics in the geopotential.

Dr. Walter Kéhnlein has analyzed the geometrical structure of
the earth’s gravitational field in the harmonic representation. Of
particular interest were the shapes of the surfaces of constant po-
tential (geoid) and constant gravity, their Gaussian and mean curva-
tures, and the curvature and torsion of the plumb lines.

Theoretical studies by Dr. Chi-yuen Wang on the correlation be-
tween the satellite-derived geoid and the heat flow distribution on
the surface of the earth have justified the hypothesis that the irregu-
lar undulations of the satellite geoid can be explained as the conse-
quence of uneven thermal expansion of the earth’s mantle, result-
ing from some heating process, perhaps an inhomogeneous distribution
of radioactive heat sources.!. Computation of variations of temperature
corresponding to several proposed models of distribution of heat

SECRETARY'S REPORT 159

sources has led to the following conclusions: 1. The inhomogeneous
layer is extended from the top of the mantle to a depth of approxi-
mately 100 to 200 km. 2. The isothermal surfaces are not simple
geometrical surfaces. Temperatures on a “level surface” near the
top mantle have fluctuations with amplitude of about 100° C.

The Satellite-Tracking Program is now at fruition in its geodetic
objectives, not only for the earth’s geopotential but also in the area
of geodetic positions and the establishment of a much more precise
worldwide geodetic system.1 Several independent calculations of im-
proved coordinates of the Baker-Nunn stations have been made dur-
ing the past year. When all detailed questions in these different
approaches to the problems have been resolved, a consolidated, con-
sistent result is expected.

Over 45,000 observations from the 12 Baker-Nunn Stations were
analyzed by Dr. George Veis, with the assistance of Mrs. Elizabeth
Wombwell, to derive the coordinates of the stations and the absolute
deflection of the vertical for seven datums.1. Although these results
are preliminary, a value of 6,378,169 meters for the semimajor axis
of the earth’s ellipsoid is obtained from the above derived deflections.
A total of 26,447 precisely reduced photographie observations of 11
objects were analyzed by Mr. Izsak to obtain least-squares estimates
for the corrections to the coordinates of the 12 camera stations. The
latter calculation was made in conjunction with determinations of
the coefficients for the tesseral and sectorial harmonics of the
geopotential.

Using simultaneous observations of satellites from pairs of the five
Baker-Nunn cameras in the Americas, Dr. Veis and Antanas Girnius
have determined the directions of the lines connecting the stations
with an accuracy of better than 1 second of are. More data from
simultaneous observations are now under analysis. These will allow
the determination of directions in both the North American and the
European datums and will permit a connection between them.
Dr. KGhnlein also devised several computer programs for the adjust-
ment of space triangulations. By using the correlation of already
adjusted coordinate values, he combines a pure geometrical method
and a dynamical method for a joint adjustment computation of the
station coordinates.*

Although instrumented satellites are beginning to be important,
satellite drag determined from tracking data continues to be the
most productive source of information concerning the atmosphere
above 200 km. Recent work at the Observatory, made possible by
the Znjun 3 and F'xplorer 17 satellites, includes the study of the atmos-
phere under conditions of low solar activity and at low heights and

160 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

high latitudes.1_ Atmospheric density variations, which directly in-
fluence satellite drag, are interpreted as the result of temperature
changes in the atmosphere. Dr. Luigi G. Jacchia generated a com-
prehensive model of the major temperature variations—diurnal, with
solar activity, with geomagnetic activity and semiannual—for presen-
tation at the fifth International Space Science Symposium in Florence
in May. Dr. Jacchia and Jack W. Slowey found that the heating
accompanying geomagnetic disturbances was greater in the auroral
zones than at middle latitudes; on quiet days, however, there is no
detectable latitude effect. The relation between atmospheric heating
and the geomagnetic index A,, which had been found to be nearly
linear during magnetic storms, was found to depart very markedly
from linearity on near-quiet days. This finding implies greater heat-
ing from this source than had been suspected before.

Plans are being drafted for a construction of quasi-static atmospheric
models to be followed by dynamic models to fit the observed density
data.

Techniques other than satellite tracking are also useful in high-
atmosphere studies by Observatory scientists. Instrumentation aug-
menting the Radio Meteor Project has been developed by Dr. Mario
D. Grossi to measure wind velocities at altitudes about 90 km. above
ground level by collecting and processing doppler information con-
tained in radar returns from meteor trails.2. A network of three sta-
tions about 50 km. apart will allow at least two determinations per
hour of the three components of the wind velocity vector with an
accuracy of a few m sec*.

Dr. N. P. Carleton conducts a program of research that includes
laboratory study of certain atomic collision processes and analysis
of phenomena of the aurora and airglow in terms of the collision
processes involved. In the laboratory Dr. Carleton and Dr. Charles
H. Dugan have been continuing study of excitation of metastable
states of N., O2, CO, and O by electron impact, combined with a
study of subsequent collision processes involving these metastable
atoms and molecules. Dr. Carleton has modified computer programs
to examine the solution of two new problems: (1) the exact heating
effects of the input of energetic photoelectrons into the ionosphere
during the day, with application to the excitation of the dayglow, and
(2) the calculation of the heating effects that could be produced in
the ionosphere by a rocket-borne transmitter.

Dr. Carl Sagan and his colleagues considered several phenomena
and properties of the planet Venus. The 8-13 micron limb-darkening
observations of Venus from Afariner IJ and other observations have
been shown to be consistent with a wide variety of models of the

See footnotes, p. 177.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 161

Cytherean clouds and atmosphere, including semi-infinite, purely ab-
sorbing atmospheres in radiative or convective equilibrium, and
multiple-scattering cloud layers with a range of single-scattering al-
bedos, again in radiative or convective equilibrium. Calculations in
another paper show that the microwave phase effect can be explained
in terms of the thermal and electrical properties of certain geochem-
ically abundant materials at the temperatures of Venus’s surface,
assuming very slow planetary rotation.

Conditions on Mars have also been studied by Dr. Sagan, who has
found that the wave of darkening is preferentially localized in times
and locales on Mars when the mean daytime temperatures in the nuclei
of the dark areas are above the freezing point of water. This result
is consistent with the hypothesis that the wave of darkening is a bio-
logical response to local increases in humidity and temperature. From
investigations of the question of nitrogen oxides on Mars, Dr. Sagan
and his associates find that previously published observations of Mars
in the infrared, visible, and ultraviolet set an upper limit to the NO,
abundance there of about 1mm-atm. If there is no water on Mars, the
theoretical upper limit obtained from photochemical and thermo-
dynamic equilibrium is also 1 mm-atm. With 10 microns of precipi-
table water in the Martian atmosphere, the NO, upper limit is reduced
by an order of magnitude. These quantities of NO, are so small that
it seems unlikely that the nitrogen oxides play a significant role in
any observable on Mars, except possibly the blue haze.

Life may have evolved on other planets of this or other solar systems
as it has on the planet earth. Dr. Sagan and his colleagues have
reported the laboratory synthesis of one of the key molecules impli-
cated in the origin of life. The molecule, adenosine triphosphate
(ATP), supplies most of the energy for chemical processes in all
terrestrial organisms, The work was performed in collaboration with
Cyril Ponnamperuma and Ruth Mariner, at NASA’s Ames Research
Center. The ATP was synthesized by shining ultraviolet light on a
solution of adenine, ribose, and a phosphorus compound. Adenine
and ribose have previously been synthesized in similar experiments;
phosphates are thought to have been present in the primitive oceans.
Because of the absence of ozone from the primitive atmosphere of the
earth, ultraviolet light is thought to have penetrated to the primitive
oceans. The efficiency with which ATP was produced in these experi-
ments suggests the possibility that the first organisms on earth ob-
tained most of their energy from ATP synthesized abiologically by
ultraviolet solar radiation, instead of from metabolically produced
ATP, as contemporary organisms do.

Drs. Fred Franklin and Allan F. Cook have continued their study
162 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

of the structure of Saturn’s rings. The dynamics of the rings are
considered in a rediscussion of Maxwell’s Adams Prize Essay on the
stability of the rings. Photometry of rings A and B has been used
to derive the optical thickness of five representative portions of the
rings and the phase variation and albedo of the ring particles.

The theory of diffuse reflection from scattering layers based on the
equations of radiative transfer breaks down for dense dispersions of
scattered particles very large relative to the wavelength. Dr. William
M. Irvine’s recent examinations of the necessary correction to the
usual multiple-scattering theory may relate to the situation of Saturn’s
rings.

Disturbances to the motion of Neptune previously attributed to the
planet Pluto have been reexamined by Dr. Whipple. Other evidence
indicates that Pluto is too small to produce the observed effects. Dr.
Whipple has shown that a belt of comets outside the orbit of Neptune
can account for the disturbances.

A long-range project of Mr. Izsak’s concerns the utilization of
digital computers for the complex algebraic manipulations required
by analytical perturbation theories in celestial mechanics. A com-
puter program for the analytical development of the planetary dis-
turbing function has just been completed.1. With the help of this
program the duplication of Leverrier’s classical development for
Jupiter and Saturn takes about one minute of computing time.

Meteoritice science—Many rich clues to the origin and workings of
the solar system are provided by meteorites, meteoroids, interplane-
tary dust, and the wide range of phenomena related to them. These
phenomena must be contained comfortably in any satisfactory picture
of the evolution of the solar system. To exploit the diverse informa-
tion offered by these bits and fragments of solid matter, the research
program of the Observatory is correspondingly broad.

Fiscal year 1964 was particularly noteworthy for the meteoritic
science program, because several important instrumentation complexes
were completed. Large-trough antennas were added to all five remain-
ing sites of the Radio Meteor Project *; the full 16-station Prairie
Meteorite Network ® went into operation; the simultaneous optical and
radar networks for observing artificial meteors from Wallops Island
became operational *; and the mass spectrometer for stable-isotope
analyses of meteorites was finished.” Since observational data are the
backbone of any scientific program, the availability of these new
facilities holds promise of many productive investigations.

The addition of large-trough antennas to all the sites of the Har-
vard-Smithsonian Radio Meteor Project permitted the collection of
reliable data on meteors smaller than any we have previously been

See footnotes, p. 177.
SECRETARY'S REPORT 163

able to study. Thus a long-standing objective has been met, and major
results from the operation of the improved network are imminent.
Using data selected from that obtained over the past several years,
Drs. Gerald S. Hawkins and Richard B. Southworth have examined
the physical characteristics of the small radio meteors; they find that
the majority of the faint radio meteors show total fragmentation.
The decrease in average velocity as the size of the bodies decreases,
originally reported by Drs. Hawkins, Southworth, and B. A. Lind-
blad, was studied further by Kenneth Baker.*

The relationship between the flux of meteors incident on the earth
and the observed rate of radio meteors has been determined by Dr.
W. G. Elford ¢ in terms of (1) the distribution law as a function of
magnitude; (2) the density of meteor radiants over the celestial
sphere; (8) the parameters of the radio equipment; and (4) a simple
form for the ionized trail. The theory has been applied to the Har-
vard-Smithsonian Radio Meteor system at Havana, Illinois, and an
estimate has been made of the average flux over the earth of meteors
of magnitude 2+12. A provisional value of 80 km~hr* has been
obtained. The analysis is being extended to determine the relative
density of meteor radiants over the celestial sphere.*

A new analysis of 413 precisely reduced meteors photographed some
years ago with the Super-Schmidt cameras has been made by Dr.
Jacchia, Dr. Franco Verniani, and Robert Briggs.1 Several physical
characteristics of meteor bodies, together with their interdependences,
have been determined more accurately than has hitherto been possible.

Dr. Verniani’s investigations of the luminous and ionizing efficiencies
of meteors have been completed. These two quantities are essential
for the determination of meteor masses and densities. The photo-
graphic luminous efficiency r,, measured with respect to kinetic energy,
has been rederived from Super-Schmidt photographic data, taking
fragmentation into account. The dependence of rt, on the meteor
velocity v is found to take the form 7,~v". The exponent n turns out
to be 1.0++0.15 for both faint and bright photographic meteors. The
present evaluation of 7, has also allowed the determination of the
ionizing efficiency zz. Drs. Verniani and Hawkins * have found rz~v.
The comparison of the rates of photographic and radio meteors of
about the same magnitude confirms this relation.

The Observatory has established a field operation to observe the
luminosity and ionization produced by artificial meteors fired from
rockets launched at Wallops Island, Virginia.* The Observatory now
operates two Super-Schmidt cameras for this program. A third
camera site will be built, and a prism will be added to an additional
Super-Schmidt at the Wallops Island site. Four radar-receiving

766—-746—65——12
164 § ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

systems have been established at sites along the coast of North
Carolina. These receivers, together with a transmitter and receiver
on an ocean-going vessel, can make measurements of the ionization
of artificial meteors simultaneously with the optical observations. Dr.
Richard E. McCrosky is responsible for analysis of the optical data,
and Drs. Hawkins and Southworth, for the radar data.

The entire 16-station Prairie Meteorite Network ® has been in full
operation since early May 1964. Dr. McCrosky is principal investi-
gator. During the first months of operation the network obtained
double-station photographs of two extremely bright objects. With
magnitudes of the order of —12 and —15, both these meteors far
exceed in luminosity any object on which data have previously been
acquired. Their analysis is expected to yield interesting results. In
each case, unfortunately, the terminal mass was judged to be too
small to justify a search for the meteorite.

Dr. Cook has continued work ® with Dr. Peter M. Millman of the
National Research Council, Ottawa, and Dr. Ian Halliday of the
Dominion Observatory, Ottawa, on three Perseid meteor spectra ob-
tained at the Springhill Meteor Observatory at Springhill, Ontario,
in 1957. Dr. Cook has also worked on the physics of meteors to
generate a criterion for the mode of ablation, 1.e., to determine whether
vaporization does or does not occur and then to seek observational
evidence for the action of this criterion.

During its long life the earth’s surface has been hit many times by
large meteorites, which have produced craters. Only a limited num-
ber of these have been recognized and studied. It is clear that appro-
priate effort can extend this number significantly, and the Observatory
has been involved in occasional studies of craters or possible craters.
Dr. Paul W. Hodge visited the Henbury Meteorite Craters and the
Boxhole Crater in Australia to study the meteoritic debris in the
soil surrounding them.

A field party > made up of Ursula B. Marvin, T. C. Marvin, and
Walter A. Munn spent 16 days in August 1963 mapping and collecting
samples at the site of an unusual craterlike formation in the San Luis
Valley, Colo., to test the possibility that it could have resulted from
the impact of a small meteorite or comet. The plane-table map shows
that the “crater” is not a bowl-shaped depression in the landscape,
but that the rim is a positive feature surrounding a floor that is
concordant with the slope of the alluvial fan on which it lies. The
search through the samples for meteorite strippings, nickel-iron
spherules, or such impact products as glass or shock-produced silica
minerals has not been completed, but results to date are negative.

See footnotes, p. 177.
SECRETARY’S REPORT 165

The tentative conclusions are that the feature is probably not an
impact site but an uncommon type of sand-dune formation.

Tektites, their distribution, and possible associated impactites and
earth craters pose interesting questions. Are tektites terrestrial or
extraterrestrial in origin? If they are terrestrial, are there associated
impact craters? Dr. Whipple has suggested that a large crater, on
the order of 15 miles in diameter, may exist in the Far East area of
tektite-strewn fields. Therefore Don W. Farnsworth has begun a
map search for such an impact structure. He has so far examined
nearly 1,000 topographic maps of Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and nearby
islands. Maps showing depth to ocean bottom have been examined
and contoured. Search for an impact crater continues as maps be-
come available.

Very small particles striking the high atmosphere are stopped by
atmospheric drag before they are destroyed. Larger bodies may
fragment or ablate on striking the atmosphere, generating many
smaller particles. Hence a rain of small particles from outside the
earth is constantly falling through the atmosphere to the surface.
The identification and analysis of these particles is a challenging
problem.

The use of radio isotope techniques offers one means to identify
material as extraterrestrial. For this purpose Dr. Edward L. Fire-
man, working with Chester C. Langway of the Army Cold Regions
Research Laboratories, has collected and analyzed dust from melted
snow deep within the Greenland ice sheet. Results from this study
indicate that the exposure age of silicates in dust is less than 10,000
years.°

Mrs. Ursula B. Marvin has made comparative studies of the miner-
alogy, chemical composition, and physical properties of black spher-
ules from the Greenland ice cap and industrial black spherules
produced by welding operations.’° Results showed that weld spatter
sometimes duplicates a type of black spherule, consisting of iron oxide
(magnetite) with less than 1 percent of manganese, that is found in
the Greenland ice and has been reported from many other environ-
ments where researchers have sought extraterrestrial dust. 'The most
common weld spatter, however, is metallic iron or nickel-iron that can
be distinguished from cosmic dust by a high content of chromium.
This work was done in collaboration with Mr. Langway.

Collections of small particles have also been made on Observatory
collectors flown on a U-2 at high altitudes by the U.S. Air Force,
and on a B-52 by the NASA Flight Research Center, both at Edwards
Air Force Base, California. These collections have been analyzed by
Dr. Frances Wright and Dr. Hodge. They have also examined

166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

material from polar ice cores in search for extraterrestrial particles
and have collected particles on the slopes of the Arizona Meteorite
Crater for analysis and comparison with other matter that now seems
to be extraterrestrial.

A particular problem has been the isolation of volcanic particles,
which may be confused with extraterrestrial material. To better
characterize volcanic particles, Dr. Wright is examining collections
made by personnel from the Baker-Nunn Stations: samples from
Kilauea Iki 1959 eruption, collected by D. V. Mechau; samples from
Trazu 1963 eruption, collected by Ron La Count; and samples from
Ubinas 1954 eruption, collected by A. Oakes.

Drs. Wright and Hodge have sampled these volcanic dust deposits
to search for and analyze microscopic spherules that might possibly
be similar to the supposed meteoritic spherules found in polar ice
sediments. In the size range of 10 to 100p, approximately 2 10-> of
voleanic particles are perfect or nearly perfect spherules, and 2x 10-°
are rough magnetic spheroids. In composition they are similar to
only a few of the polar glacier particles the two have analyzed.
They have concluded that since the numerical ratio of spherules to
irregular particles for the volcanic dust is so much different from that
for the ice sediments, a volcanic origin for the latter seems impossible.
Therefore a meteoroidal origin for the arctic and antarctic spherules
is the most reasonable hypothesis.

Another place where cosmic dust might be expected to accumulate
is the sediment on the ocean floor. Dr. Craig M. Merrihue is explor-
ing this possibility. A mass-spectrometric search for extraterrestrial
material in a magnetic separate from a modern Pacific red clay
revealed the presence of He* and an argon isotope anomaly, suggest-
ing the presence of cosmic dust. The cosmic gases are not cosmogenic
because the isotope pattern does not resemble that expected from
cosmic-ray-induced reactions. It appears that the most abundant
magnetic component of cosmic dust is saturated with gases picked up
from the solar wind. A computer program has been assembled to
solve the diffusion equation for gases from spheres, assuming an arbi-
trary nonuniform initial gas profile. This program will permit accu-
rate determinations of diffusion constants and activation energies for
meteoritic minerals,

The Observatory’s interest in dust goes beyond the earth’s atmos-
phere. The joint research of Drs. Giuseppe Colombo and Don A.
Lautman, with Irving Shapiro of the M.I.T. Lincoln Laboratory,
concerning the concentration of cosmic dust around the earth has
established that the density of dust in the vicinity of the earth can
be enhanced by a factor of nearly 10‘ over that in the zodiacal cloud,
SECRETARY’S REPORT 167

provided that the initial velocities with respect to the earth are small
(about 1.5 km sec). The trapping mechanism consists of an initial
encounter with the earth’s atmosphere followed by conversion to a
long-lifetime orbit by radiation pressure. Drs. Colombo and Laut-
man have found that long-lifetime orbits of particles ejected from
the moon cannot contribute significantly to the cloud, nor can particle
breakup, since the drag pressure at the relatively high capture altitudes
is not high enough to break the particles.

The particles responsible for the zodiacal light are concentrated
near the plane of the ecliptic. Dr. Southworth has performed a cal-
culation combining the space-density distribution of the zodiacal dust
particles (as observed in the zodiacal light, and as theoretically pre-
dicted from the Poynting-Robertson effect) with the observed redden-
ing of the Fraunhofer corona (which is sunlight diffracted by the par-
ticles), showing that the mean radius of the observed particles exceeds
15 microns. Some invisible submicron particles may also be present,
but their total mass will be negligible compared to that of the larger
particles.

Dr. Charles Whitney has obtained laboratory evidence confirming
the suggestion that interstellar bands are produced by resonant absorp-
tion in small grains. Experimental work confirms the presence of the
band for Na grains, and theory shows that such grains, when coated
with ordinary ice, will produce an absorption just at the astronomi-
cally observed wavelength.

Meteorites, solid bodies from space that survive the plunge through
the earth’s atmosphere, warrant careful attention, since they are the
only samples yet available of extraterrestrial material. It is fruitful
to study their mineralogy, crystal structure, metallurgy, chemical
composition, isotope distribution, and other physical properties.

In her continuing mineralogical studies Mrs. Marvin has estab-
lished zircon as a meteoritic mineral by its positive identification in
the Vaca Muerta mesosiderite and the Toluca iron meteorite.?° Zir-
con, because it concentrates uranium, thorium, hafnium, and rare
earths, is a mineral of choice for age determinations and measure-
ments of Zr/Hf ratios and rare-earth distribution in meteorites. The
character and mode of occurrence of zircon in Vaca Muerta and
Toluca were studied in detail in collaboration with Cornelis Klein, of
the Harvard University Department of Geological Sciences, who
determined chemical compositions by means of electron-probe
microanalyses.

During the past year Dr. Joseph I. Goldstein completed a metallur-
gical study of Widmanstitten patterns in metallic meteorites. The
object of the project was to establish the roles of pressure, tempera-

See footnotes, p. 177.
168 | ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

ture, and time in the formation of these patterns. A method of analy-
sis using the method of finite differences was developed for the
diffusion-controlled growth of the Widmanstitten patterns. As nec-
essary inputs to the growth analysis, the interdiffusion coefficients for
the Fe-Ni system, as a function of pressure, temperature, and compo-
sition, were measured, as were the diffusion coefficients in both the «
and y phases. The Fe-Ni phase diagram was also redetermined at
temperatures above 500° C. Dr. Goldstein proposes two alternative
models for the origin of meteorites in which the Widmanstitten
pattern formed at low pressures.

Dr. Matthias F. Comerford has initiated a program to investigate
defect structures in meteorites and micrometeorites. An attempt is
being made to relate the substructure observed in extraterrestrial ob-
jects to the thermomechanical procedures required to produce simi-
lar structures in laboratory alloys. The environmental effects of both
pressure and temperature upon the kinetics of nucleation and growth
of these defect structures can be examined in some detail. Prelimi-
nary results indicate that both effects are present and may act in
opposing ways.

Dr. Fireman and his associates conduct a broad program of re-
search to measure cosmic-ray-produced radioactive and stable isotopes
in meteorites, in recovered satellites, in dust collections from the polar
regions, and in deep-sea sediments. In this program one must con-
stantly improve and maintain low-level counting equipment and other
types of analytical apparatus. The group has determined the time
various meteorites were exposed to cosmic rays. The youngest is the
Farmington meteorite, which was exposed for only 10,000 years; the
oldest stony meteorite is Norton County, exposed for about 400,000,000
years. Results on recovered satellites indicate that in addition to
cosmic rays there are isotope effects produced by Van Allen particles
and solar flares. These effects are quite different from cosmic-ray
effects.

An important advance was made during the past year when James
C. DeFelice and Dr. Fireman obtained sufficient material to measure
the short-lived argon-37 in the whole-rock, magnetic, and nonmagnetic
phases of the recently fallen chondrite Peace River. Although the
radioactive contents are similar to those of other newly fallen chon-
drites, the ratio of argon-37 to argon-39 is somewhat lower than they
have previously observed. Also, its carbon-14 is lower. In another
analysis, the cosmic-ray exposure age of the Pribram meteorite was
found to be identical to the value of the exposure age obtained for the
Bruderheim fall, which is typical for chondrites. The tritium, argon-
SECRETARY’S REPORT 169

39, and carbon-14 contents are similar to those obtained for other stony
meteoroids.

Earlier measurements of tritium in satellite fragments have been
extended by Dr. David Tilles and Mr. DeFelice, who have obtained
upper limits for the tritium content of Discoverer 14 and for the
amount of tritium in a trapped state in August 1960. These measure-
ments, combined with measurements previously reported in other
satellites, have given evidence for an increase of at least an order of
magnitude in trapped tritium flux in less than 4 months and a decrease
of at least an order of magnitude in less than 7 months. Such time
variations are believed to have been caused by direct injection of solar-
flare tritons into the Van Allen belts in November 1960.

Dr. Merrihue’s analysis of data on xenon and krypton from minerals
and chondrules from the Bruderheim meteorite indicates that chon-
drules, enriched in Xe"”® yet depleted in xenon, are the most primitive
material yet studied and reflect an early high-temperature origin.
Based on a Xe’”*-xenon correlation, the minerals appear to be an equi-
librum aggregation. The difference between meteoritic and terrestrial
xenon can be attributed to a fast proton irradiation of meteoritic mate-
rial and the accumulation in meteorites of fission xenon, possibly from
Pu™* spontaneous fission.

Dr. Merrihue has devised a method of trace-element determinations
by mass spectrometry of neutron-irradiated samples. Preliminary
results, based on data collected at Berkeley, were obtained for U?**, Se,
Te, I, Br, and Cl, and also for the Br®/Br® ratio, which appears to be
anomalous in meteorites. Also, a new method of potassium-argon
dating, applicable to minute samples, has been established, based on
A*/A® ratios in neutron-irradiated samples in which A*® is produced
by the K*(n,p) reaction. Thus both potassium and radiogenic argon
are determined in the same sample, and a correction for air contamina-
tion can be applied using the measured A**. This represents a con-
siderable improvement over conventional methods.

The rare-gas mass spectrometer has been completed by Dr. Tilles
and his associates.’ As a first application of the instrument, the
group plans searches of deep-sea sediment for evidence of material
of extraterrestrial origin. Similar searches are planned in particulate
matter from Greenland ice, collected by Dr. Fireman and Mr. Lang-
way. The major research emphasis with this spectrometer will be on
studies of meteoritic samples—isotopic composition and amounts of all
noble gases in separated phases of meteorites.

From the theoretical aspect, Dr. Henri E. Mitler is studying the
effects of cosmic-ray bombardment on meteorites. Quantitative analy-
sis of radionuclides produced can lead to estimates of the preatmos-

170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

pheric size of the meteorite and of the proton flux to which it has been
subjected.

Cometary science-—Comets and their associated phenomena are inti-
mately related to other aspects of the solar system, such as zodiacal
dust, micrometeorites, and evolution of the planets. Cometary in-
vestigations hence constitute a vital link in the Observatory’s overall
research program.

A study by Dr. Whipple of the secular variation in the absolute
brightnesses of comets leads to the possibility that several of the known
periodic comets may disappear within the coming decade. The ob-
servational rediscoveries of the periodic comets suggest that these cal-
culations are more pessimistic with regard to the lifetimes of comets
than is justified; nevertheless, the predictions should serve a useful
purpose in stimulating search for the rediscovery of old comets and in
clarifying the question concerning the actual decay processes whereby
comets do, indeed, cease to be visible.

Dr. Whipple, in the study mentioned earlier, has also discussed the
evidence that a thin belt of comets probably remains in a plane not far
from the mean plane of the planets, but outside the orbit of Neptune.
Such a belt of comets can account for disturbances of Neptune’s
motion.

The utilization of the Baker-Nunn cameras for comet observations
has been expanded.’ + Using photographs thus obtained, the Ob-
servatory is pursuing three objectives: determination and understand-
ing of the motion of comet tails; photometry of comets; and time-lapse
motion pictures to document the changes in a comet and its tail with
time.

The research on tail motions is guided by Daniel Malaise,'* who has
previously observed that the direction of the tail of a comet may
oscillate significantly about the line directed through the comet away
from the sun. The explanation of this phenomenon is not clear, but
it may be related to some characteristic of the solar wind. Baker-
Nunn photographs are an excellent source of the observational data
required to pursue this topic. Data obtained during the past year
are being analyzed.

The photometric investigations are the responsibility of Dr.
Southworth. For this purpose, defocusing lenses have been sent to
a number of the stations. An unresolved question in cometary
astronomy is whether comet magnitudes do indeed change in correla-
tion with solar activity, as some investigators have reported. A study
of this question is one of several investigations based on the photo-
metric data.

SECRETARY’S REPORT 171

In conjunction with the icy-conglomerate model of a comet, Dr.
Whitney reexamined the theory of heat transfer within glaciers. He
showed that radioactive transfer can be appreciable and can signifi-
cantly influence measured temperatures in glaciers. Dr. Whitney,
Dr. Charles A. Lundquist, and Douglas Pitman have initiated labora-
tory work to elucidate the transfer of heat and mass within porous,
subliming matrices such as snow or frosty sand. Preliminary experi-
ments confirm that this work will be highly valuable for insight into
comet phenomena.

Solar observations —Information about solar phenomena may be
acquired by relatively direct or by indirect observational techniques.
Heating of the earth’s atmosphere or oscillations in the direction of a
comet’s tail are examples of indirect means of gleaning solar data.
The Observatory is also involved in more direct measurements.

Dr. Leo Goldberg directs a broad program of solar-oriented re-
search, mostly under the auspices of Harvard College Observatory, but
partly within the research program of the Astrophysical Observatory.
An important part of Dr. Goldberg’s program concerns the prepara-
tion of solar spectrometers for rocket and satellite flights.

A model of the Harvard spectrometer for Orbiting Solar Observa-
tory B was flown in an Aerobee high rocket from White Sands, New
Mexico, on September 6, 1963. Three full scans and part of a fourth
were obtained of the solar spectrum between 1350 and 500 A. Good
records were obtained of the emission lines and of the Lyman con-
tinuum. Dr. Robert W. Noyes of the Astrophysical Observatory as-
sisted in the reduction of the data from this experiment.

The flight model for the OSO-B spectrometer was integrated into
the spacecraft at Ball Brothers Research Corporation in Colorado
and subsequently delivered to Cape Kennedy for final testing and
preparation for flight. A disastrous accident during spin-balance
testing, in which the third stage of the rocket to which the satellite was
attached ignited, caused the destruction of the entire payload. A
spare instrument now being calibrated will be integrated into a new
spacecraft during the next fiscal year. Dr. Noyes supervised the set-
ting up of a “Quick Look” Data System, by which data from experi-
ments aboard the Orbiting Solar Observatories will be acquired by
Harvard-SAO in decoded, legible form within a short time of the
satellite’s pass over a ground station, thus permitting near-real-time
control of the experiment.

Designs are currently being prepared * for an improved version of
the spectrometer capable of one arc minute resolution on the disk,
which will probably be flown about 1966.

Observations made at the Kitt Peak National Observatory concern-
ing magnetic fields in the solar photosphere have been analyzed by
Dr. Noyes. These observations yielded a definite correlation between
photospheric velocities and magnetic fields, in the sense that the highest
magnetic fields (about 50-75 gauss) found in quiet regions tend to
occur in regions where material is moving downward (with velocities
of about 0.2 km sec). This has been interpreted as a result of con-
vective sweeping of magnetic fields toward the downward-descending
periphery of the large convective cells (supergranulation) which cover
the surface of the quiet sun.

Dr. Giovanni Fazio has reduced gamma-ray detector data from 1,000
orbits of Orbiting Solar Observatory I.1° These reductions have
shown no evidence of gamma rays with energy greater than 50 million
ev from the sun, even during solar flares, with an upper limit of the
order of 10-* photons/cm? sec. Likewise, no evidence was found for
celestial sources of primary gamma rays. The sensitivity of the detec-
tor was limited by background radiation.

The possibility of detecting neutrinos from the sun is a lively topic
of discussion in astrophysical circles. Some authors suggest that this
can be accomplished by using the reaction in which a solar ve combines
with a Cl" nucleus to give Ar*? and an electron. The radioactive gas
Ar®” may be detected by counting techniques. The Observatory has
laboratories equipped to do this counting, as Ar*’ is one of the radio-
active isotopes analyzed in meteorites. Since the v- reaction cross sec-
tion with Ar*’ is extremely low, vast quantities of Cl*” must be used.
Since Ar®? can also be generated by cosmic-ray-induced rections, the
experiment must be performed under conditions of extreme radiation
shielding—say deep in the earth. Dr. Lundquist has suggested that
commercially pumped brine wells might meet these requirements, if
the Ar*’ from the chlorine-rich brine could be measured. Dr. Mitler
has made a study of the relative amounts of Ar*’ generated by the solar
neutrino reaction and by other undesired reactions. The practical
implementation of the experiment is being studied.

Stellar observations —A feature of current astrophysics is the rapid
expansion of observational possibilities into previously inaccessible
parts of the electromagnetic spectrum and to radiation other than
electromagnetic. This has been accomplished in part by carrying
instruments above the absorption of the atmosphere. New technology
has also contributed to the enlarged observational capabilities. Com-
parison and correlation of data from widely spaced frequencies have
also proved to be powerful procedures.

An example of correlated observations at quite different frequencies
is the study of flare stars... During preagreed time intervals, the

SECRETARY’S REPORT 173

Observatory employs its network of Baker-Nunn cameras to photo-
graph a flare star repeatedly. The probability of successful observa-
tion is good since several of the cameras can be used simultaneously.
During the same interval, one of several radio telescopes cooperating in
the program continuously observes the same flare star. The resulting
records are searched for nearly simultaneous optical flares and sudden
increases in radio signal. During the past year about 180 hours of
combined observations have been made. Correlations previously
found to exist between faint optical flares and radio events were con-
firmed by several major events.

The continuing cooperative effort with Sir Bernard Lovell of the
Jodrell Bank Experimental Station, England, and Dr. Whipple and
Leonard H. Solomon of the Astrophysical Observatory has led to
further new evidence concerning optical flares and radio flares on
peculiar dwarf stars, such as UV Ceti. A distinction between two
types of event has been made, with at least one analogy to solar phe-
nomena being drawn. Further, the coincidence in time between
optical and radio flares shows that the velocity of light is constant to
better than one part in 2X 10° over a range in wavelength exceeding a
factor of 2X10°. Similar joint programs are being pursued with the
Division of Radiophysics, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial
Research Organization, Sydney, Australia, and the Arecibo Iono-
spheric Observatory of Cornell University.

Project Celescope,” the satellite project to use television techniques
to survey the ultraviolet magnitude of stars, has finished its develop-
mental phase with completion of the prototype instrument. The proj-
ect next enters the critical phase during which the prototype undergoes
extensive environmental testing, and the instrument for flight on an
Orbiting Astronomical Observatory is fabricated to the proven proto-
type design. Overall aspects of this challenging undertaking have
engaged the attention of Dr. Whipple, Dr. Lundquist, and Project
Scientist Dr. Robert Davis. The procedures for absolute calibration
of the four ultraviolet television photometers have been established by
Dr. Davis and Mr. Malaise. Preparations for automated data reduc-
tion and analysis are coordinated by Dr. Owen Gingerich.

At wavelengths still shorter than ultraviolet light, projects are
underway at the Observatory to measure X-rays and y-rays from
astronomical sources. The most exciting experiment now in progress
is an attempt by Dr. Fazio and Dr. Henry Helmken of the Observatory
and Dr. D. Hill of M.I.T. to detect y-rays with energy greater than 107?
ev from the radio galaxy Cygnus A and from the quasi-stellar radio
sources. A large (28 ft. square) fixed parabolic mirror in conjunction
with a steerable plane mirror (40 ft. square) is being used to detect the

174 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1964

Cerenkov light resulting from charged-particle showers in the atmos-
phere. One possible origin of these showers is extraterrestrial gamma
radiation. In the experiment an increase in the number of showers as
a source transits the sensitive cone of the mirror would indicate the
emission of gamma radiation by the source. In preliminary trials
Cerenkov light was detected, and results indicate that this device
should provide the most sensitive detector thus far in the search for
gamma radiation. The mirror system is part of the solar furnace at
the U.S. Army Laboratories, Natick, Mass. The Army has provided
use of the instrument and technicians during these experiments.

The feasibility of using a spark chamber in conjunction with a tele-
vision recording system to detect primary gamma rays was exhibited
in the laboratory, and a high-altitude balloon experiment using this
detector is in preparation. A series of spark chambers was con-
structed and evaluated, and a final design was chosen. A television
camera (vidicon) was used to observe spark patterns of cosmic-ray
particles in the chambers. The vidicon picture was recorded on
16 mm film by a kinescope recorder and also transmitted by radio
and recorded. In its ultimate form, this instrumentation can be
adapted for satellite use to measure the flux of primary gamma rays
and to determine their arrival direction and energy.

Dr. Comerford and Dr. Fazio are using laboratory X-ray apparatus
to evaluate techniques such as reflection and scattering for the collec-
tion and detection of radiation from distant sources and to aid in the
design and construction of devices to implement these techniques.
Currently, the aim is not to map the sky, but to look carefully at dis-
crete sources in the hope of resolving some of the uncertainties about
their nature.
