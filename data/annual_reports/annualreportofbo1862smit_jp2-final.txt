OF TUE

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

[PRESENTED IN THE FIRST ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, AND
ADOPTED BY THE BOARD OF REGENTS, DECEMBER 13, 1847.]
6

INTRODUCTION.

General considerations which should serve as a guide in adopting a Plan
of Organization.

1. Witt or Smituson. The property is bequeathed to the United
States of America, “to found at Washington, under the name of the
SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, an establishment for the increase and dif-
fusion of knowledge among men.”’

2. The bequest is for the benefit of mankind. The government of
the United States is merely a trustee to carry out the design of the
testator.

3. The Institution is not a national establishment, as is frequently
supposed, but the establishment of an individual, and is to bear and

erpetuate his name.

4, The objects of the Institution are, Ist, to increase, and 2d, to
diffuse knowledge among men.

5. These two objects should not be confounded with one another.
The first isto enlarge the existing stock of knowledge by the addition
of new truths; and the second, to disseminate knowledge, thus in-
creased, among men.

6. The will makes no restriction in favor of any particular kind of
knowledge; hence all branches are entitled to a share of attention.

T. Knowledge can be increased by different methods of facilitating
and promoting the discovery of new truths; and can be most exten-
sively diffused among men by means of the press.

8. To effect the greatest amount of good, the organization should
be such as to enable the institution to produce results, in the way of
increasing and diffusing knowledge, which cannot be produced either
at all or so efficiently by the existing institutions in our country.

9. The organization should also be such as can be adopted provi-
sionally; can be easily reduced to practice, receive modifications, or
be abandoned, in whole or in part, without a sacrifice of the funds.

10. In order to compensate, in some measure, for the loss of time
occasioned by the delay of eight years in establishing the Institution,
a considerable portion of the interest which has acerued should be
added to the principal.
8 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

11. In proportion to the wide field of knowledge to be cultivated,
the funds are small. Economy should therefore be consulted in the
construction of the building; and not only the first cost of the edifice
should be considered, but also the continual expense of keeping it in
repair, and of the support of the establishment necessarily connected
with it. There should also be but few individuals permanently sup-
ported by the Institution.

12. The plan and dimensions of the building should be determined
by the plan of organization, and not the converse.

13. It should be recollected that mankind in general are to be ben-
efited by the bequest, and that, therefore, all unnecessary expendi-
ture on local objects would be a perversion of the trust.

14. Besides the foregoing considerations deduced immediately from
the will of Smithson, regard must be had to certain requirements of
the act of Congress establishing the Institution. These are, a library,
aimuseum, and a gallery of art, with a building on a liberal scale to
contain them.

SECTION I.

Plan of Organization of the Institution in accordance with the foregoing
deductions from the will of Smithson.

To Increase Know ence. It is proposed—

1. To stimulate men of talent to make original researches, by offer-
ing suitable rewards for memoirs containing new truths; and

2. To appropriate annually a portion of the income for particular
researches, under the direction of suitable persons.

To Dirruse Know.epcGe. It is proposed—

1. To publish a series of periodical reports on the progress of the
different branches of knowledge; and

2. To publish occasionally separate treatises on subjects of general
interest.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN TO INCREASE KNOWLEDGE.
I.—Dy stimulating researches.

1. Facilities to be afforded for the production of original memoirs
on all branches of knowledge.

2. The memoirs thus obtained to be published in a series of vol-
umes, In a quarto form, and entitled Smithsonian Contributions to
Knowledge.

3. No memoir on subjects of physical science to be accepted for
publication which does not furnish a positive addition to human
knowledge, resting on original research; and all unverified specula-
tions to be rejected.

4. Each memoir presented to the Institution to be submitted for
examination to a commission of persons of reputation for learning in
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 3)

the branch to which the memcir pertains; and to be accepted for pub-
lication only in case the report of this commission be favorable.

5. The commission to be chosen by the officers of the Institution,
and the name of the author, as far as practicable, concealed, unless
a favorable decision be made.

6. The volumes of the memoirs to be exchanged for the transac-
tions of literary and scientific societies, and copies to be given to all
the colleges and principal libraries in this country. One Pe of the
remaining copies may be offered for sale; and the other carefully pre-
served, to form complete sets of the work, to supply the demand
from new institutions. .

7. An abstract, or popular account, of the contents of these me-
moirs to be given to the public through the annual report of the
Regents to Congress.

IIl.—Ly appropriating a part of the income, annually, to special objects
of research, under the direction of suitable persons.

1. The objects, and the amount appropriated, to be recommended
by counsellors of the Institution.

2. Appropriations in different years to different obje ee so that,
in course of time, each branch of knowledge may receive a share.

3. The results obtained from these appropriations to be Sanlencal
with the memoirs before mentioned, in the volumes of the Smithso-
nian Contributions to Knowledge.

4, Examples of objects for which appropriations may be made.

(1.) System of extended meteorological observations for solving the
problem of American storms.

(2.) Explorations in descriptive natural history, and geological,
magnetical, and topographical surveys, to collect materials for the
formation of a Physical Atlas of the United States.

(3.) Solution of experimental problems, such as a new determina-
tion of the weight of the earth, of the velocity of electricity, and
of light; chemical analyses of soils and plants ; collection and publi-
cation of scientific facts accumulated in the oflices of government.

(4.) Institution of statistical inquiries with reference to physical,
moral, and political subjects.

(5.) Historical researches and accurate surveys of places celebrated
in American history.

(6.) Ethnological researches, particularly with reference to the dif-
ferent races of men in North America ; also, explorations and accurate
surveys of the mounds and other remains of the ancient people of
our country.

DETAILS OF THE PLAN FOR DIFFUSING KNOWLEDGE.

I.— By the publication of a series of reports, giving an account of the new
discoveries in science, and of the changes made from year to year in all
branches of knowledge not strictly professional.

1. These reports will diffuse a kind of knowledge generally inter-
esting, but which, at present, is inaccessible to the public. Some of
10 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

the reports may be published annually, others at longer intervals, as
the income of the Institution or the changes in the branches of
knowledge may indicate.

2. The reports are to be prepared by collaborators eminent in the
different branches of knowledge.

3. Each collaborator to be furnished with the journals and publi-
cations, domestic and foreign, necessary to the compilation of his
report; to be paid a certain sum for his labors, and to be named on
the title-page of the report.

4, The reports to be published in separate parts, so that persons
interested in a particular branch can procure the parts relating to it
without purchasing the whole.

5. These reports may be presented to Congress for partial distri-
bution, the remaining copies to be given to literary and scientific in-
stitutions, and sold to individuals for a moderate price.

The following are some of the subjects which may be embraced in
the reports:
I. PHYSICAL CLASS.

1. Physics, including astronomy, natural philosophy, chemistry,
and meteorology.

2. Natural history, including botany, zoology, geology, &c.

3. Agriculture.

4, Application of science to art.

II. MORAL AND POLITICAL CLASS.

5. Ethnology, including particular history, comparative philology,
antiquities, &c.

6. Statistics and political economy.

7. Mental and moral philosophy.

8. A survey of the political events of the world, penal reform, &c.

III. LITERATURE AND THE FINE ARTS.

9. Modern literature.
10. The fine arts, and their application to the useful arts.
11. Bibliography.

12. Obituary notices of distinguished individuals.

Il.—By the publication of separate treatises on subjects of general interest.

1. These treatises may occasionally consist of valuable memoirs
translated from foreign languages, or of articles prepared under the
direction of the Institution, or procured by offering premiums for the
best exposition of a given subject.

2. The treatises should, in all cases, be submitted to a commission
of competent judges previous to their publication.

3. As examples of these treatises, expositions may be obtained of
PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION. 17

the present state of the several branches of knowledge mentioned in
the table of reports.

SECTION II.

Plan of organization, in accordance with the terms of the resolutions of
the Board of Regents providing for the two modes of increasing and
diffusing knowledge.

1. The act of Congress establishing the Institution contemplated
the formation of a librar ry and a museum; and the Board of Regents,
including these objects in the plan of organization, resolved to divide
the income* into two equal parts.

2. One part to be appropriated to increase and diffuse knowledge
by means of publications and researches, agreeably to the scheme
before given. The other part to be appropriated to the formation of
a library and a collection of objects of nature and of art.

These two plans are not incompatible one with another.

4. To carry out the plan before described, « library will be required,
consisting, first, of a complete collection of the transactions aud pro-
ceedings of all the learned societies in the w: rld; second, of the more
important current periodical publications, aid other works necessary
in preparing the periodical reports.

5. The Institution should make special collections, particularly of
objects to illustrate and verify its own publications.

6. Also, a collection of instruments of research in all branches of
experimental science.

7. With reference to the collection of books, other than those men-
tioned above, catalogues of all the different libraries in the United
States should be procured, in order that the valuable books first pur-
chased may be such as are not to be found in the United States.

8. Also, catalogues of memoirs, and of books and other materials,
should be collected for roudering the Institution a centre of biblio-
graphical knowledge, whence the student may be directed to any.
work which he may require.

9. It is believed that the collections in natural history will increase
by donation as rapidly as the income of the Institution can make pro-
vision for their reception, and, therefore, it will seldom be necessary
to purchase articles of this kind.

10. Attempts should be made to procure for the gallery of art casts
of the most celebrated articles of ancient and modern sculpture.

11. The arts may be encouraged by providing a room, free of ex-
pense, for the exhibition of the objects of the Art-Union and other
similar societies.

12. A small appropriatiow should annually be made for models of
antiquities, such as those of the remains of ancient temples, &c.

12 PROGRAMME OF ORGANIZATION.

13. For the present, or until the building is fully completed, be-
sides the Secretary, no permanent assistant will be required, except
one, to act as librarian.

14. The Secretary, by the law of Congress, is alone responsible to
the Regents. He shall take charge of the building and property,
keep a record of proceedings, discharge the duties of librarian and
keeper of the museum, and may, with the consent of the Regents,
employ assistants.

15. The Secretary and his assistants, during the session of Congress,
will be required to illustrate new discoveries in science, and to exhibit
new objects of art ; distinguished individuals should also be invited
to give lectures on subjects of general interest.

This programme, which was at first adopted provisionally, has
become the settled policy of the Institution. The only material
change is that expressed by the following resolutions, adopted Jan-
uary 15, 1855, viz:

Resolved, That the 7th resolution passed by the Board of Regents,
on the 26th of January, 1847, requiring an equal division of the in-
come between the active operations and the museum and library,
when the buildings are completed, be, and it is hereby, repealed.

ftesolved, That hereafter the annual appropriations shall be appor-
tioned specifically among the different objects and operations of the
Institution, in such manner as may, in the judgment of the Regents,
be necessary and proper for each, according to its intrinsic import-
ance, and a compliance in good faith with the law.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

To the Board of Regents :

GENTLEMEN : I have the honor again, at the commencement of your
annual session, to present the report for another year of the opera-
tions of the Institution intrusted by the General Government of the
United States to your special care.

So much public attention has been absorbed during the last year
by the exciting events of the war that we might at first suppose
that little or no thought could be bestowed upon purely scientific
subjects, such as fall within the province of this Institution to culti-
vate, or indeed upon any kind of knowledge which has not an im-
mediate bearing on the special requirements of the times. But even
in the most sanguinary and gigantic warfare the responsibility for
the important plans which are to determine the result of the conflict
devolves upon the few, and leaves the many to fall into a condition
of comparative mental inactivity.

As arelief from the tedium of this condition, or a prevention from
falling into it, a large number of subordinate officers, and even pri-
vates, of the army have devoted themselves to pursuits connected
with natural history, or to the solution of problems of a theoretical
or practical character.

Although the immediate object of war is the destruction of life
and property, yet astate of modern warfare is not a condition of
evil unmingled with good. Independent of the political results
which may flow from it, scientific truths are frequently developed
during its existence of much theoretical as well as of practical im-
portance. The art of destroying life, as well as that of preserving it,
calls for the application of scientific principles, and the institution of
scientific experiments on a scale of magnitude which would never be
attempted in time of peace. New investigations as to the strength
of materials, the laws of projectiles, the resistance of fluids, the ap-
plications of electricity, light, heat, and chemical action, as well as of
aerostation, are all required.

The collection of immense armies of individuals of different ages
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and nations affords the means of obtaining data of much interest to
the ethnologist, while the facts which are githered from the unusual
experience of the battle-field and hospital afford materials for the
advance of physiology, surgery, and medicine, which a century of
ordinary observation would fail to furnish.

In illustration of what has been done in the line we have mentioned,
I would refer to the extended labors of the Sanitary Commission and
of the department under the direction of the Surgeon General.
The one, besides aiding in the improvement of the health and com-
fort of the soldiers, has collected a large number of interesting facts
relative to the moral and economical condition of the army; while the
other, in addition to its immense labors in the care of the sick and the
wounded, has recorded the statistics of every part of its varied
operations, and formed a collection of illustrations of surgical anatomy
which is perhaps unrivalled in any part of the world.

In reference to all the inquiries to which I have alluded, the Smith-
sonian Institution has been called upon for aid and counsel, and has
continually rendered active co-operation and assistance. Its labors,
however, in this line, as well as in several other branches of its ordi-
nary operations, are not attended with results which can be given to
the world through its publications.

During the continuance of the war we must expect to find that
more attention is given to the collection of facts than to the deduction
from them of general principles ; the latter must be deferred to a
period of more tranquillity, when the mind is in a better condition
for continued application to the development of a single idea; con-
sequently the number of papers which have been presented to the
Institution since the date of the last report is less than that of any
previous year.

The meteorological system which had been established, and was in
successful operation for several years before the commencement of
the war, has been much deranged, few records of observations having
been received from the middle States and none from the southern;
still, as I have before intimated, the labors of the Institution have
been industriously pursued in lines more in accordance with the
peculiar condition of the country. <A large portion of all the time of
the Secretary has been devoted to inquiries referred to the Institu-
tion by the different departments of government. The work of pre-
paring the duplicate specimens of the Institution for distribution
has been continued. The library has been thoroughly overhauled,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. U5

partially rearranged, and a new catalogue of the transactions and
proceedings of learned societies prepared for publication. Ex-
tensive repairs and improvements have been made in the build-
ing, by which several rooms, previously occupied by tanks for receiy-
ing rain water, now rendered useless by the introduction of Potomac
water, have been reclaimed for other uses.

The efficient income of the Institution has been very essentially
impaired during the past year. Ist. By the increased price of
all the materials of printing and other articles used in the opera-
tions of the establishment. 2d. Qn account of the high premium
on gold required to pay the agents of the Institution in Europe and
to meet the incidental expenses of exchanges, and the cost of serials
and other works necessary for the use of the collaborators and other
persons engaged in researches for the Institution. 3d. In conse-
quence of the non-payment of the interest on the southern State
stocks forming part of the extra fund.

Still it will be seen by the report of the Executive Committee that
the expenditures of the Institution during the past year have been
kept within the receipts, and a large balance retained in the treasury
to meet the contingencies which may arise, particularly in the present
unstable condition of public affairs.

The interest on the Indiana stock for the first half of the year was
paid in specie, which was deposited with Messrs. Riggs & Co., with
the understanding that it could be withdrawn in the same currency
at any time it might be required. In the settlement of the accounts
for the year this specie was sold and the premium added to the re-
ceipts.

A power of attorney has been forwarded from the President of the
United States to Messrs. Fladgate, Clarke & Finch, of London, author-
izing them to collect the remainder of the Smithsonian fund, which
was left, by the Honorable Mr. Rush, as the principal of an annuity to
the mother of the nephew of Smithson. The power of attorney was
forwarded to the care of Honorable Charles F. Adams, American
minister to England, and the money, when collected, will be de-
posited with George Peabody & Co., bankers, London, subject to the
order of the Institution.

As a fact connected with the history of this establishment, I may
mention that the charter of a society in this city known asthe National
Institute expired in July last, and that in accordance with the law of
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Congress incorporating that society, the Secretary of the Interior de-
livered the remainder of its library and museum to this Institution.

The National Institute was founded twenty years ago, for the culti-
vation of science, by a number of gentlemen of the city of Washing-
ton, most of them connected with the government. It at first found
favor with the public, and the hope was entertained that an
enduwment, in the form of a donation of land, or otherwise, would be
granted by Congress, by which it would be enabled to support a
museum and a library, and publish a series of transactions ; but this
hope was not realized, and as the field it proposed to occupy fell
within the province of the Smithsonian Institution, the society grad-
ually declined in activity, and finally allowed its charter to expire by
its own limitation. Before the organization of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, the personal effects of Smithson, and the large collection of speci-
mens procured by the exploring expedition, were placed in charge of
the National Institute, and from the similarity of names the two estab-
lishments were at first frequently confounded with one another.

A large number of valuable books and specimens were presented
to the Institute by various societies and individuals; but as there was
not suflicient means to constantly employ a curator, or even to supply
appropriate rooms for their preservation, these collections have been
rendered comparatively of little importance. The specimens in
ornithology and entomology were almost entirely destroyed by in-
sects, and the library reduced principally to broken sets of periodicals
and transactions of learned societies, duplicates of those already
‘in the library of the Institution. In some cases, however, we have
been enabled to supply deficiencies, and the books so incorporated
into the Smithsonian collection have been properly designated by an
appropriate mark in the manuscript catalogue of the library. The
most valuable part of these collections was that which related to
mineralogy and ethnology.

Publications. The publications of the Institution, as stated in previ-
ous reports, consist of three series: Ist. The Contributions to Knowl-
edge. 2d. The Miscellaneous Collections. 3d. The Annual Reports.

The Contributions include memoirs embracing the records of origi-
nal investigations and researches, resulting in new truths, such as are
considered interesting additions to the sum of human knowledge.
Twelve volumes in quarto of this series have been published—the
thirteenth is still in the press.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. VG

The Miscellaneous Collections include works intended to facilitate
the study of the various branches of natural history, to give instruc-
tion as to the method of observing natural phenomena, and to furnish
a variety of other matter connected with the progress of science. Of
this series four large octavo volumes have been issued, and a fifth
has been commenced.

The Annual Reports to Congress consist, each, of an octavo volume
of 450 pages. They contain the report of the Secretary as to the
operations and condition of the Institution, the acts of the Regents,
and an appendix, giving a synopsis of the lectures delivered at the
Institution, extracts from correspondence, and articles of a character
suited to meteorological observers, to teachers, and other persons
especially interested in the promotion of knowledge.

Contributions to knowledge.-—The following papers have been ac-
cepted for publication in the 15th volume of Contributions:

1. The concluding paper of Dr. Kane’s Series of Observations in
the Arctic Regions.

2. The reductions of the observations of McClintock while in search
of Sir John Franklin.

3. Parts II to VI of the Reduction of the Girard College Observa-
tions, by Professor Bache.

4, Ancient Mining on the Shores of Lake Superior, by Charles
Whittlesey.

5. On Respiration in the Chelonia, by Drs. Mitchell and Morehouse.

6. On Magnetic Observations in Pennsylvania and adjacent States,.
by Professor Bache.

In the reports for 1859 and 1860 accounts are given of two parts
(which were subsequently divided into three parts) of a series of
redactions of the magnetic observations made at Girard College,
Philadelphia, from 1840 to 1845, inclusive, by Professor Bache. The
first two of these papers relate to the investigation of what is called
the eleven-year period of the variations of the needle, which coin-
cides with the recurrence in frequency of the spots on the sun. The
third paper relates to the influence of the moon on the variation of
the magnetic needle as shown by the Girard observations.

Of the same series there have been accepted and printed parts 4,
5, and 6. The fourth refers to the change of horizontal force coin-
ciding with the eleven-year period of the spots on the sun. In ex-
planation of this it may be stated that the whole magnetic force of

the earth upon a needle freely suspended causes it to take a direction
H. Mis. Doe. 25 2

18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

inclined to the horizon, at all places north and south of the magnetic
equator, which direction is called the magnetic dip or inclination.
The force with which the needle is drawn into this position may be
resolved into two forces—one in the plane of the horizon, and the
other perpendicular to this plane. By knowing the horizontal con- -
ponent, and the angle of the dip, the total force may be readily eal-
culated, and as this element can be much more accurately determined
than that in the line of the dip, it is the one which is generally made
the object of observation.

In the case of the observations made by Professor Bache, the in-
strument employed was one of Gauss’s large bifilar magnetometers,
which cousisted of a magnetic bar weighing twenty-five pounds,
upwards of thirty-six inches long, and suspended horizontally by two
long fine wires slightly diverging from parallelism. This magnetic
bar instead of being allowed to take a north and south position, or to
settle in the direction of the magnetic meridian, was forced to turn
nearly at right angles to this position by twisting the pair of suspen-
sion wires so as to overcome the directive force of the magnetism of
the earth. In this position the bar was in a state of equilibrium
between two forces, viz: the torsion of the wires tending to
turn the north end of the needle round towards the west, and the
horizontal magnetic force of the earth which tended to draw it back
intc the meridian. In this condition, if the magnetism of the earth
diminishes, the force of torsion will prevail, and the bar will move ©
from the meridian. If the magnetism of the earth increases, the
torsion will be relatively weaker,and the bar will move in an opposite
direction. Attached to this bar was a mirror which, reflecting the
image of the divisions of a scale into the object glass of a telescope,
enabled the observer to perceive a variation in the intensity of the
force, equivalent to a ten-thousandth part of the whole force.

The indications of this instrument were corrected for variations in
magnetism produced by changes of temperature, and for a constant
small diminution in the intensity of the bar, from an actual loss of its
magnetic force. But besides these changes in the magnetism of the
bar itself, there is a progressive change in the horizontal component
of the earth’s magnetism, which may be due either to a change in the
direction of the force, or to a change of its intensity. After allowing
for these, from observations made in various parts of the earth on
changes of direction and intensity, the next step was to separate the
large disturbances, which have been called magnetic storms, from the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

series of ordinary records. For this purpose deviations from the nor-
mal position of the bar amounting to thirty-three scale divisions were
considered as due to abnormal disturbances of this kind. This num-
ber was ascertained by a theorem founded on the doctrine of proba-
bilities, for which we are indebted to Professor Pierce, of Cambridge.
Out of 24,231 observations, 1,698, according to this criterion, were
considered asabnormal disturbances. After all the larger disturbances
were excluded, new monthly means were taken, and all deviations
from these of thirty-three divisions were again set apart. .

The result of this elaborate investigation is, that the variation in
intensity of the horizontal component of the earth’s force is subject
to a change coincident with that found from observations in other
parts of the world, which has been called the eleven-year period, or
tbat corresponding with the frequency of the appearance of the spots
on the sun. The observations extended only through five years,
which was less than half the whole period ; the data were not there-'
fore sufficient to determine the movement through its complete cycle,
although they served to mark the minimum point and the ascending
and descending parts of the curves of illustration between two
maxima. :

The fifth part relates to investigations on the effect of the sun in
producing daily and annual variations of the horizontal component
of the magnetic force. These investigations were made upon the
quantities which remained after removing from the tables the larger
or fitful disturbances previously described, leaving the normal effect
due to the sun from a change in its distance from the earth, and per-
haps from a change in the relative position of its magnetic poles on
account of the revolution of the earth in its orbit. Blanks in the
tables of observations were filled by interpolation. From these in-
vestigations it appears that the horizontal magnetic force of the earth,
or the intensity with which a deflected magnetic needle is drawn
back toward the north, varies with the different hours of the day.
The variation is greatest in summer and least in winter; the force is
most intense at a little after 6 o’clock in the morning, and diminishes
rapidly until a little after 10 o’clock a. m., when it reaches its mini-
mum, and again commences to increase, and continues to do so until
about 3 o’clock p. m., when it again declines until about 11 0’ clock
at night. The amount of change is much greater in the day time
than at night, the whole indicating that this daily variation depends
on the varying heat derived from the sun.
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The 6th and last part of this interesting series relates to the lunar
ipfluence on the horizontal magnetic force.

Each observation, after being corrected for temperature and for the
progressive changes in the earth’s magnetism, was marked with the
corresponding lunar hours, reckoning from the passage of the moon
over the meridian. The difference was then taken between the posi-
tion of the magnetic bar, as calculated from all the hours and
that found by observation at each lunar hour, and the difference
was considered as the effect of the magnetism of the moon on the
earth.

From these and similar observations, it appears that the moon
exerts a magnetic influence on the earth. The principal magnetic
effect takes place 2h. 52 m. after the upper passage of the mcon
over the meridian; secondary effect, 1 h. 7m. ; lower passage, princi-
pal minimum, at 6 h. 41”; lower passage, secondary minimum, at 8
h. 19m. after upper.

Another paper contains an abstract of the observations and results,
with the discussion of a detailed magnetic survey of Pennsylvania and
part of the adjacent States of New York, Ohio, and Maryland,
originally made by Professor Bache, and resurveyed By Mr. Charles
A. Schott.

In the study of terrestrial magnetism, two objects are essentially
necessary: first, the direction and intensity of the magnetic force of
the earth at a given epoch; and secondly, the variation in these ele-
ments after a known interval.

In 1840, 1841, and 1843, Professor Bache made a series of obser-
vations to determine the magnetic elements at a number of prominent
places in Pennsylvania, New York, Ohio, Mary yland, and Canada. The
whole number of stations at which he ascertained the declination or
yariation was 16, and of those where the dip and intensity was ob-
served 48.

Last summer Mr. C. A. Schott, an assistant in the coast survey,
visited six of the stations at which Professor Bache had previously
observed the magnetic elements, and by carefully redetermining
them obtained the data for calculating the secular changes which
had taken place during an interval of about twenty-years. The ob-
servations originally made by Professor Bache, and also the late ones
by Mr. Schott, were obtained with instruments of great precision,
end will always furnish the elements of future comparison for the
study of the changes which the magnetic force of the earth undergoes
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21

in long periods. The paper commences with an abstract of those on
the declination. To these are added the latitudes and longitudes of
the places observed.

The observed magnetic variations, at the different places, have
been reduced to the epoch of January, 1842, by adding the annual
increase, namely 2’ 7, found by comparing the observations of 1840
with those of 1862. An elaborate discussion of the horizontal force
furnishes a comparison of European and American results. The de-
ductions from the observations on the dip of the needle are given
in terms of geographical latitude and longitude, and the isoclinal
lines or lines of equal dip are protracted on a map which also con-
tains the lines of equal magnetic force, both in regard to its
horizontal and total intensity. Three of the stations visited by Mr.
Schott fell within the scope of the coast survey; and the expense of
the redetermination of the magnetic elements, at these points, was
defrayed by the superintendent of that work; the determinations at
the remaining stations were at the expense of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution.

An account of the other papers in this volume has been given in
the previous report.

Miscellaneous Collections. —Several series of articles forming parts of
the series of Miscellaneous Collections, as stated in previous reports,
have been undertaken, of which some have been completed, some are
still in hand, and others have been printed during the past year.

The first of these series is that relating to the shells of North
America, and will consist of the following works :

1. Check lists of North American shells, by P. P. Carpenter, &c.

2. Circular relative to collecting shells.

3. Elementary introduction to the study of conchology, by P. P.
Carpenter.

4, List of the species of shells collected by the United States ex-
ploring expedition, by the same author.

5. Descriptive catalogue of the shells of the west coast of the
United States, Mexico, and Central America, by the same author.

6. Descriptive catalogue of the air-breathing shells of North
America, by W. G. Binney.

7. Descriptive catalogue of several genera of water-breathing
fresh-water univalves, by the same author.

8. Descriptive catalogue of the Jelaniadae, or the remainder of ihe
water-breathing fresh water univalves, by George W. Tryon.
22 : REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

9. Descriptive catalogue of the Corbiculidae or Cyclodidae, a group
of bivalves principally inhabiting fresh-water, by Temple Prime.

10. Descriptive catalogue of the Unionidae, or fresh-water mussels.

11. Descriptive catalogue of the shells of the eastern coast of the
United States, by W. Stimpson.

12. Bibliography of North American conchology, by W. G. Binney.

The first and second articles of the foregoing list were printed in
1860, and described in the report for that year, and since then in
their wide distribution have done good service in facilitating the
collecting, labelling, and exchanging of specimens of conchology.

The third article was published in 1861, as a part of the annual report
for 1860, and a new eCcition will be incorporated in the Miscellaneous
Collections as soon as we can procure the long-promised wood-cuts
from the British Museum, to illustrate the work.

The fourth and fifth articles are still in the hands of Mr. Carpen-
ter, and will, it is expected, be ready for the press the ensuing year.

With reference to the sixth article, it may be mentioned that for
many years before his death, the late Dr. Amos Binney, of Boston,
was engaged in collecting and arranging materials for a general work
upon the land shells of the United States. The result of his labors
was published after -his decease, in three large volumes, giving co-
pious descriptions and accurate figures of all the species. His col-
lections are now in the hands of his son, Mr. W. G. Binney, of Bur-
lington, New Jersey, who has since greatly extended them, and has
brought up the subject of his father’s work to the present day, by
various supplements, memoirs, &c. He has also lately rearranzed
all the materials in his possession, and prepared from them, for this
Institution, the synopsis which is given as the sixth article in the
above enumeration.

The seventh and -eighth articles include an account of fresh-water
univalves of the United States. Within the last twenty years the
yumber of described species of this class of animals known in this
country has greatly increased. The descriptions of these previously
made were from specimens collected in isolated situations, oftentimes
by persons who had not had the opportunity of studying large col-
lections or of comparing typical specimens, and, indeed, in some
cases without access to descriptions which had been previously made
by others. The shells belonging to this class are characterized, per-
haps above most others, by a remarkable range of variation in form
and size arising from local causes, or different stages of growth, &e.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

Many of them are also furnished with so few positive specific external
characters, that for their determination an anatomical difference in
their soft parts can alone be depended upon. Tostudy, therefore,
satisfactorily single species of fluviatile shells, one must have before
him, says Mr. Binney, a very large suite of specimens of all ages, from
every portion of the district which it inhabits, as well as authentic speci-
mens of every allied described species, with an equally complete set
of individuals. Yrom these facts it is evident that among the descrip-
tions of these shells which have been made by different authors, and
published in different works, there must be many which refer to the
same species; or, in other words, that the bibliography of this branch
of natural history must abound in synonyms exceedingly perplexing
to the student, as well as exhibit imperfections in the systematic
exposition of the subject which ought not to exist. Such a con-
dition must occur from time to time in every branch of natural
history, and it therefore becomes important that some person com-
petent to the task should go over the whole field and reduce to what
is called a monograph, or single sketch, all that has been previously
done in regard to it.

Mr. Binney in his portion of the catalogue does not attempt to pre-
sent a complete monograph, but rather a report on our present state
of knowledge relative to fluviatile univalves. He has given an Eng-
lish translation of all the original descriptions and a fac-simile of the
outline of each original figure. The portion of this work which re-
lates to the fresh-water univalves of North America intrusted to Mr.
Binney has been completed, and is now in the press. The remainder
on the Melaiiadae, undertaken by Mr. Tryon, has been commenced;
but since the family contains a large number of species exhibiting
many of the variations above-mentioned, a year or more will be re-
quired before it can be completed.

The ninth article, or that relating to the Cycladidae, is nearly ready
for the press. The recent species of this group are generally small
and inhabit the fresh waters of various parts of the world, although
some belong to brackish or even marine localities. Mr. Prime has
paid particular attention to this group, and is said to be one of the
first living authorities in regard to the subject.

The eleventh article of the above-mentioned series will include
detailed descriptions by Mr. Stimpson of all the marine shells of the
eastern coast of the United States, with original notices of the internal
structure,
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The twelfth article in the series above enumerated is the biblio-
graphy of conchology, which has been prepared to avoid the neces-
sity of repeating bibliographical references in the different manuals
just enumerated. It is intended to give, first, an account of all the
articles or works of American authors, relative to conchology in
general, and secondly, those of foreign writers relative to the con-
chology of North America.

All the species referred to by authors are enumerated after the
title of each article, and such references to the page and date of
description are given as will enable any species to be quoted from
the bibliography itself without the necessity of referring to the origi-
nal. A complete index of authors, and of all the species mentioned,
placed at the end of the work, will greatly facilitate its use. The
first part of this work, embracing the writings of American authors,
forms an entire volume of the Miscellaneous Collections of upward of
700 pages, of which 400 are already stereotyped.

Another series of works belonging tothe Miscellaneous Collections
is intended to facilitate the study and the advancement of the science
of entomology, of which the several articles are the following:

1. Instructions for collecting and preserving insects.

2. Catalogue of the described Diptera (flies, mosquitoes, &c.) of
North America, by Baron Osten Sacken.

3. Catalogue of the described Lepidoptera (butterflies, moths,
&e.) of North America, by Dr. Jno. G. Morris.

4. Classification of the Coleoptera (beetles, &c.) of North America,
by Dr. Jno. L. LeConte.

5. Synopsis of the described Neuroptera (dragon flies, &c.) of
North America, with a list of the South American species, by
Hermann Hagen.

6. Synopsis of the described Lepidoptera of North America. Pt.
1, Diurnal & Crepuscular Lepidoptera, by Dr. Jno. G. Morris.

7. List of the Coleoptera of North America, with descriptions of
new species, by Dr. John L. LeConte.

8. Monographs of the Diptera of North America, by H. Loew, with
sratnoue by Osten Sacken.

9. Catalogues of Homoptera and Hemiptera (chinches, roaches,
&c.) of North America, by P. R. Uhler.

10. Descriptive catalogue of the Hymenoptera (bees, wasps, &c.)
of North America, by Dr. Henri DeSaussure.

These have all been described in previous reports, and have all been
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

printed excepting the 9th and 10th, which are still in preparation,
and a part of the Tth, which has been delayed on account of the call
on Dr. LeConte to a position in the medical department of the army
of the United States.

‘The instructions for collecting and preserving insects were published
in the appendix to the report for 1858. A new and enlarged edition
will be published during the coming year as a part of the next volume
of the Miscelluneous Collections.

Another part of the Miscellaneous Collections is a series of tables
furnished by Professor Guyot in addition to the set of physical tables
by the same author, previously published by the Institution. The
first of these is intended for converting the klafter and feet of Vienna
into measures of length of other countries. They are to be substituted
for those contained in the former edition, because they are derived
from a new comparison of the klafter of Vienna and French toise, by
Von Struve and Von Littrow. This comparison has furnished the
standard adopted in the great trigonometrical survey of Austria.
The second set of tables is for converting the Spanish or Mexican
and Bolivian varas and feet into English and French measures.

The preceding tables have been printed, and are inserted in volume
I of the Miscellaneous Collections.

The third set of tables gives the value of a degree of the meridian
in every degree of latitude from the equator to the poles, in metres,
kilometres, German miles, nautical leagues, French leagues, geo-
graphical or nautical miles, and English statute miles.

The fourth set of tables gives the value of each degree of longitude
on each parallel of latitude, from 0° to 90°, in the same measures as
those mentioned above.

The two preceding sets of tables, which are based on Bessel’s ter-
restrial elements, have been computed under the direction of Professor
Bache at the office of the Coast Survey, and have been kindly fur-
nished by him for this volume. The columns of the German miles and
nautical and French leagues have been added to make the table more
complete.

The fifth set of tables is for converting the most usual measures of
length into each other, such as myriametres and kilometres, Austrian,
Prussian, and German miles, nautical leagues, French, Spanish, and
Mexican leagues, geographical or nautical and statute miles, and Russian
wersts.
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The sixth set of tables is for the conversion of the corresponding
surface or square measures of the preceding table into each other.

These measures, which are also founded on the late terrestrial ele-
ments of Bessel, have been selected with reference to the frequency
of use in the consultations of the official publications of different
Ruropean nations. Each of the above tables furnishes the value of”
every full number from 1 to 100, in six figures for the measures of
length, and seven for those of surface.

The seventh set of tables gives the velocity of rotation of the earth
for each degree of latitude, expressed in the measures of length most
frequently used, and will facilitate computations in regard to the
velocity of the wind.

Lhe whole series comprises over 17,000 separate numbers, filling
70 large octavo pages.

It is proposed to add to these tables one giving the length of time
of sunshine in different latitudes for each day in the year, and, to
complete the series, a number of tables for calculating the resultant
direction of the winds.

It is believed that these tables will be received as a welcome addi-
tion to the physical tables previously published by the Institution,
and which are now well known and used in every part of the civilized
world. They will be of value to the meteorologist and physical
geographer, as well as to the statistician and political economist.
The first set is indispensable for easily computing distances on globes,
maps, &c.; the second will greatly facilitate the use of the numerous
data furnished by travellers, scientific publications, and especially
the official statistical information contained in the various documents
of the states of Europe. The selection of the various measures is
made with special reference to the latter

as the myriametre and ©
kilometre for the study of later French publications, and the com-
mon French league for the older ones; the Austrian and Prussian
miles, the Russian werst, and English statute mile for publications in
the countries where those measures are used. In the preparation of
these tables a question has arisen whether an additional series
should be constructed for the conversion of the American foot into

the English, between which there is, unfortunately, a slight dif-
ference. ;

pense of the government, with the exception of the cost of the

wood-cuts, which is at the expense of the Institution. The re-
port for 1861 contains, besides the report of the Secretary and the acts
of the Regents, a Eulogy on Prof. Felton, by Dr. Woolsey, President
of Yale College; a Eulogy on Hon. Stephen A..Douglas, by Hon. 8. 8.
Cox ; synopsis of lectures on the Construction of Bridges, by Fair-
man Rogers, of the University of Pennsylvania; lecture on the rela-
tion of Time and Space, by Prof. 8. Alexander, of the College of New
Jersey; lecture on Arctic Explorations, by Dr. I. I. Hayes ; a memoir
of Geoffroy St. Hilaire, by M. Flourens ; the chemical analysis of the
‘Sun by means of the Solar Spectrum ; the smail planets between Mars

Daubrée, and anumber of articles on Archeology, all translated for the
Institution ; also a report on Nitrification, prepared for the Institution
by LB. F. Craig, M.D.; the history of Petroleum, by T. Sterry Hunt ;
and the explosibility of Coal Oil, by Z. Allen ; list of birds inhabiting
the District of Columbia, by E. Coues and D. W. Prentiss;.and a
series of prize questions of scientific societies, together with a num-
ber of minor articles.

The reports for a number of years past have contained a series of
memoirs of distinguished men of science, members of the French
Academy, translated for the Institution by ©. A. Alexander, Esq., of
this city. It is intended to continue the translation and publication
of similar memoirs, and when the number is sufficient to form an
ordinary sized volume, to collect and publish them in a separate
form.

Of the last report, 10,000 extra copies were ordered by Congress, of
which 4,000 were presented to the Institution for distribution among
its special: correspondents. The requests for copies of this work
have been constantly increasing from year to year, and it is to be
regretted that the pages were not stereotyed, since there is now a
large demand for back numbers, to complete sets, which cannot be
obtained.

Previous to last year we were allowed to have extra copies of cer-
tain articles of the report struck off for separate distribution, but
under the new rules for the regulation of the public printing this
privilege was denied us in the case of the report for 1861. It is
thought, however, that if a proper statement were made to Congress,
a clause would be added to the acts relative to the government
printing which would give all the facilities required.
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The following general rules for the distribution of the reports have
been adopted :

Ist. They are presented to all the meteorological observers who
send records of the weather to the Institution.

2d. To the collaborators of the Institution.

od. To donors to the museum or library.

4th. To colleges and educational establishments.

5th. To public libraries and literary and scientific societies.

6th. To teachers, or individuals who are engaged in special studies,
and who make direct application for them.

It is proper to remark that, owing to the many changes which have
taken place since the commencement of the war in the list of corre-
spondents of the Institution, it has not been thought advisable to send
the report, as heretofore, to all whose names are on the record of
distribution, but in most cases to wait until direct application is made
by letter for a copy of the work. Whenever a report is sent to any
address, a separate announcement is made through the mail by enclos-
ing a blank receipt, to be signed and returned to the Institution.

In view of the great cost of paper at the present time and the
space required for storage of a large edition of each volume of the
publications of the Institution, it has been thought advisable to ste-
reotype the text and strike off only as many copies as are required for
immediate distribution, printing a new supply from time to time to
satisfy the demands as they arise. By the adoption of this plan,
should the cost of paper return to its normal rate, the expense of the
stereotype plates would be saved. ;

Meteorology. —The meteorological system has continued to be ear-
ried on as in former years, though necessarily very much dimin-
ished in extent on account of the absence of records from the southern
States. The volume of meteorological reductions from 1854 to 1859,
an account of which was given in the last report, has been published
and distributed to the meteorological observers, to public lbraries,
and foreign institutions. Many letters have been received expressing
the new interest in the system that has been awakened by the appear-
ance of this volume, and the records which before existed only in the
archives of the Institution are now in the hands of a large number
of the students of science, whose various tastes and abilities, will
enable them to draw from them important general results. The
second volume is still in press at the Government office, the print-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

ing of it having been delayed by that of documents of more im-
mediate importance. It is expected, however, that it will be finished
during the year 1863.

The daily telegraphic bulletin of the state of the weather, which
was entirely discontinued for some time on account of the demands of
public business, has been partially resumed, and we are indebted to
the courtesy of Mr. Anson Stager for occasional despatches since
the early part of December last, from stations in the Rocky moun-
tains, and even from points as far west as California. These telegrams,
however are not sufficient to enable us to predict, with much proba-
bility, the changes of weather, without the additional information from
the south and southwest. The telegraphic bulletin giving the daily
condition of the weather at various important positions on the con-
tinent of Europe continues to be lithographed by the Imperial Ob-
servatory at Paris, and is sent to the Institution by every steamer.

In May last a circular was distributed asking for information on
the subject of tornadoes, the principal design of which is to direct
attention to a full and definite system of observations, so that on the
recurrence of tornadoes precise and uniform reports may be obtained
as to all the features of the phenomenon. In addition to the special
replies to the circular, a number of general answers have been re-
ceived, which are of interest in helping to define the regions of our
country where these destructive visitants frequently appear, and
those in which they are happily almost unknown. From Steuben,
Maine, Mr. J. D. Parker writes: ‘‘ There was never a tornado seen
hereabouts by any one, so far as I can learn;’’ and Mr. R. H. Gar-
diner, at Gardiner, in the same State, says: ‘‘ Tornadoes are of very
rare occurence in this part of the country. I have no knowledge of
any within the last fifty years.’’ From Vermont, Mr. Hiram A.
Cutting, of Lunenburg, informs us that ‘‘there never was but one
tornado, in this section, in my remembrance, and that was at Victory,
about twenty miles northwest of this place, in the summer of 1842.”
Mr. Levi Packard, residing in the State of New York, at Spencertown,
Columbia county, between the Hudson river and Massachusetts, tells
us there are no tornadoes in that tract of country. On the other hand,
we are informed that over the swampy region of the great bend of the
Mississippi tornadoes are very frequent, and the paths of many of them
are marked upon the ground for miles by prostrate trees and other
indications of a violent disturbance of the atmosphere.
ish)

0 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Correct general information of this kind would furnish material for
the preparation of an interesting map, showing at a glance the
regions where tornadoes annually prevail, and those where they oc-
cur only occasionally, or not at all. In meteorological investiga-
tion we always make a step in advance when the region to which
phenomena are limited can be accurately defined.

Since the latter part of October, a series of daily observations has
been made for the Institution, by Mr. Force, on the temperature of
the hydrant water in Washington. The water flows some six or
seven miles through iron pipes, under ground, before reaching the
place of delivery,,and acquires, approximately, the temperature of
the soil at the depth at which the pipes are laid. The observations
were made at a hydrant out of doors, about T 0’ clock every morning,
the water being allowed to flow two or three minutes before noting
the temperature. When the curves for the water and the air are
plotted on the same diagram and the same scale, they exhibit to the
eye, in avery striking manner, the extreme fluctuations of the tem-
perature of the air, compared with that of the ground, at the depth
of only two or three feet. They also show the slowness with which
variations of temperature penetrate the earth. The change pro-
duced by a decided increase or decrease of temperature being gene-
rally indicated by the water two or three days after it occurred in
the open air.

Among the contributions relative to meteorology which have been
received at the Institution, is a series of tri-daily observations made
at Brunswick, Maine, by the late Professor Parker Cleaveland, from
1808 to 1859. The records include observations on the ordi-
nary thermometer, the maximum and minimum thermometer, the
barometer, rain-gauge, wind-vane, &c. Itis proposed to publish these
in full, as a part of the second volume of the ‘‘Meteorological Re-
sults,” but for this purpose it is desirable that the means for months,
years, and the whole period, should be calculated, and this work is
now in progress, and will probably be finished before the printer
will call for the copy. The publication of these observations is in
accordance with the plan adopted to print in full a number of long
series of observations such as those we have already published, viz:
for Providence, Rhode Island, and Washington, Arkansas. They
will be of much interest for solving various meteorological problems,

such as the recurrence of particular phenomena, changes of seasons,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. SM

verification or disproval of the many empirical rules which have been
proposed and are used for predicting the weather, &c. . The exten-
sive series of observations made by Dr. 8. P. Hildreth, of Marietta,
Ohio, mentioned in a previous report, belong to the same class, and
will also be inserted in the volume above mentioned.

We have already referred to the additions to the meteorological
tables of Professor Guyot, and stated that it is proposed to still fur-
ther increase these tables by a series intended to facilitate the calcu-
lation of the mean direction of the wind.

The directions and blanks for making meteorological observations
which have been prepared and published at the expense of the In-
stitution have been extensively distributed in this country, and trans-
lated and reprinted abroad. The geographical and statistical society
of Mexico has recently adopted them, and signified the intention of
co-operating with the Institution in extending its system of observa-
tions more widely over this continent. Were not our general system
of meteorology interrupted by the discontinuance of the reception of
observations from the southern States, this would be an important
addition to our means of tracing the extent of disturbance of the
atmosphere which accompanies our winter storms.

Professor Guyot availed himself of a visit which he made to Europe
last year to establish by his own observation the relation of the
standard barometers used by the Institution to the most important
standards of the European observatories. The comparisons were
made by means of two Fortin barometers, with cistern of constant
level, as modified by Ernst, of Paris, and constructed several years
avo by that skilful artist for the Institution. Both instruments had
been previously tested by long usage, and just before leaving this
country their relation to a large standard barometer by Newman, of
London, and a large sized barometer by Ernst, was ascertained by a
series of numerous comparisons made with great care. “These two
instruments were directly compared in Europe with a standard
barometer at Kew observatory, now acknowledged as the nor-
mal barometer among English meteorologists, and with the stan-
dard instruments at the Brussels, Berlin, and Geneva observatories,
by the kind permission and assistance of the directors of these several
institutions, Professors Stanley, Quetelet, Enke, and Plantamour.
The last set of comparisons at Geneva, Switzerland, was found par-
ticularly useful from the fact that by the untiring care of Professor
Plantamour the relation of his barometer has been fully established
32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

with that of Regnault in the College de France, and that of the ob-
servatory of Paris. On his return Professor Guyot made a new series
of comparisons with the same Smithsonian standards as before,
the results of which proved that no change had taken place during
his absence in the two barometers used abroad. It is believed
that these comparisons establish a correspondence of the Euro-
pean and American standard barometers within the narrow lmit
of one or two-thousandths of an inch. A large standard is about to
be prepared under the direction of Professor Guyot, to which these
determinations will be referred.

' The meteorological branch of the operations of the Institution still
continues under the charge of Mr. William Q. Force, to whose habits
of order and scrupulous accuracy the system is much indebted for
whatever value it possesses.

Among the contributions to the meteorological materials of the
Institution, presented during the last year, is a series of continuous
records of the changes of atmospheric temperature made by a ma-
chine invented by Dr. James Lewis, of Mohawk, New York. | This
instrument consists of an arrangement of a number of brass and iron
wires, whose relative contraction and expansion give motion to
a metallic point, the several positions of which are marked by a
puncture in a fillet of paper, produced by a blow of a hammer
moved by clockwork, repeated at regular intervals of fifteen minutes.
Although instruments of this kind have been frequently constructed,
they have generally not possessed sufficient sensibility to indicate the
fitful changes of the atmosphere. Dr. Lewis appears, however, to
have been more successful in his invention, and from the results
which he has presented to us it would appear that the registers of his
self-recording instrument are of considerable value in determining
the general law of changes of temperature, especially during the day,
and thus furnishing corrections by which the mean temperature of
places in the same latitude can be obtained from observations made
at only one or more hours of the day. It may be mentioned here
that an idea has been very prevalent in this country among observers
that to obtain the average temperature of a place, the best times of
observation are about sunrise and sunset, and at 2 or 3 o’clock in the
afternoon; but as the rising and setting of the sun occurs at different
times in different seasons of the year, and as the maximum tempera-
ture occurs at different hours in different latitudes, it is best always
to make the observations as nearly as possible at fixed hours, as, for
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. So

instance, at those which have been adopted by this Institution, viz: T,
2, and 9; since, by observing this rule, corrections derived from such
observations as those made by Mr. Lewis can be applied soas to give with
more precision the average temperature of the place of observation.

The present Surgeon General, Dr. Hammond, takes a lively interest
in meteorology, as one of the branches of science intimately con-
nected with his department; and as soon as the posts and canton-
ments are again permanently established will reorganize the system
of army observations on a more extended scale, and furnish it. with
the instruments and instructions prepared under the direction of this
Institution.

Laboratory.—The operations of the laboratory during the past
year have principally consisted in the preparation of alarge quantity of
Laborraque’s disinfecting liquid, and the continuance of the examina-
tion of minerals preparatory to a distribution of duplicates. More than
a thousand bottles of the disinfecting liquid have been prepared for
the use of the hospitals in the city of Washington. The efficacy of
this substance has been demonstrated by abundant experience.
Simply sprinkling it on the floor, or wetting with it a cloth placed
near the source of unpleasant effluvia, at once renders the air of
the apartment entirely inodorous. The preparation of this substance
is still going on and will be continued as long as the article may be
required for the hospitals.

The examination of the minerals preparatory to a distribution of
the duplicates has not been carried on as rapidly as could be wished,
on account of the absence of the person to whom this duty was as-
signed. We have, however, ready for distribution, upwards of two
hundred sets of specimens, properly labelled, of the stones used in
erecting the public buildings in the city of Washington.

In consideration of the high rate of exchange no purchases of
foreign apparatus have been made during the past vear. Occasion
however, has been taken, in the interval of other business, to remodel
the cases of the apparatus room, in order to a better disposition and
display of the instruments. The room itself is fifty feet square with
a ceiling of twenty-five feet in height. Around the four sides of this
room, cases of about six feet deep and ten feet high have been con-
structed. The upper floorings of these cases extend about two feet
beyond their front, and thus form a projecting gallery entirely around
the room, which serves for the display of larger instruments as well

H. Mis. Doc. 25——3
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

as to increase the available capacity of the apartment. The whole
arrangement produces a pleasing architectural effect, while from the
size of the cases instruments may frequently be used in the way of
experiment without bringing them out into the room, or exposing
them to the handling of visitors.

Collections of Specimens of Natural History, &c.—In the last two re-
ports a distinction was drawn between the large collections of speci-
mens of natural history, &c., which have been made through the
agency of this Institution and what is called the Smithsonian Museum.
This distinction has become necessary in order to separate more
clearly in the public mind two objects, which, although they are gen-
erally confounded, are in the case of this Institution essentially dif-
ferent. The object of making large collections of duplicate speci-
mens is twofold, first, to advance science by furnishing to original
investigators, wherever they may reside, new materials for criti-
cal study; and second, to diffuse knowledge by providing colleges,
academies, and other educational establishments with the labelled
specimens necessary to give definite ideas of the relations and diver-
sities of the various productions of nature. The principal end
attained by the public museum of the Institution has been the grati-
fication and incidental instruction of the visitors to the city of Wash-
ington. It is true that there are preserved in the museum the type
specimens cf the species and genera which have been described, and
of which accounts have been published at the expense of the Smith-
son fund, or by other means; but for the preservation of these there
is required no costly building nor corps of attendants, and, indeed,
the charge uf them might well be assumed by other establishments.

From the foregoing exposition it will readily be seen that while
the collecting and distributing of large numbers of specimens is an
important means of increasing and diffusing knowledge, and as such
is in strict accordance with the will of the founder of this Institution,
the support of a public museum, the effects of which must of neces-
sity be ina great degree local, is not so consistent with the liberal
intention of the bequest.

It should not be inferred from the foregoing remarks that I mean to
disparage the establishment of a general collection of objects of na-
ture and art, like that of the British Museum or the Garden of Plants,
which includes in its design the encouragement of original study as
well as of popular instruction and amusement. On the contrary, I
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. I)

have always advocated .this measure as one of national importance,
while I have endeavored to show that it ought not to be attempted
by means of the Smithsonian fund, and that it could only be properly
carried out bya liberal annual appropriation from the public treasury.

I have thought it necessary frequently to urge the importance of
guarding against the tendency to increase the expenditure on local
objects, and against accepting presents on condition that they shall
be perpetually preserved and exhibited to the public at the expense
of the Smithsonian fund. If this propensity were indulged in and
donations solicited on the terms mentioned, which are those usually
agreed to in similar cases, the whole income of the bequest would be
ultimately absorbed in providing house-room and accommodations for
the collections ; and the active operations, as they are called, which
have given so much celebrity to the name of Smithson, and have
constituted the distinctive feature of the establishment, would cease.

The collections of specimens which have formed the prominent sub-
ject of the preceding remarks may be divided into two classes,
namely, those which have been studied and an account of them pub-
lished in the reports of the government expeditions, or in the trans-
actions of the Smithsonian and other institutions, and those which
have not been described, and which consequently are considered of
much interest to the naturalist, who may be anxious to make new
explorations in the domain of natural history. Of both classes the
Institution possesses a large number, for the disposition of which the
following geueral rules have been adopted :

First. To advance original science, the duplicate type specimens
are distributed as widely as possible to scientific institutions in this
and other countries, to be used in identifying the species and genera
which have been described.

Second. For the purposes of education, duplicate sets of specimens,
properly labelled, are presented to colleges and other institutions of —
learning in this country.

Third. These donations are made on condition that due credit is to
be given the Institution in the labelling of the specimens, and in all
accounts which may be published of them.

Fourth. Specimens are presented to foreign institutions, on condi-
tion that if type specimens are wanted for comparison or other use
in this country they will be furnished when required.

Fifth. In return for specimens which may be presented to colleges
and other institutions, collections from localities in their vicinity shall -
be furnished when wanted.
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In the disposition of the undescribed specimens of the collection,
the following considerations have been observed as governing prin-
ciples : | ,

First. The original specimens are not to be intrusted for descrip-
tion to inexperienced persons, but to those only who have given evi-
dence of an ability properly to accomplish the task undertaken.

Second. Preference is to be given to those who have been engaged
in the laborious and difficult enterprise of making complete mono-
eraphs. ;

Third. The investigator may be allowed, in certain cases, to take
the specimens to his place of residence, and to retain them for study
a reasonable time.

Fourth. The use of the specimens is only to be given on condition
that a series of types for the Smithsonian Museum will be selected
and properly labelled, and the whole returned in good condition.

Fifth. In any publications which may be made of the results from
an investigation of the materials from the Smithsonian collection, full
credit must be accorded to the Institution for the facilities which
have been afforded.

During the past year, the labelling of specimens for colleges and
other educational institutions has been continued, but the work has
not advanced with as much rapidity as was expected, owing to the
eall upon many of our co-laborers to join the army. Under the
most favorable circumstances the labelling requires much labor, and
cannot be properly done except by persons specially trained in par-
ticular branches of natural history.

The assorting and labelling of the principal part of the shells is
still in progress under Mr. Philip P. Carpenter, of Warrington, Eng-
land, assisted by Dr. Alcock. Other shells have been named, or are
in the process of being named, by Prof. Agassiz and Dr. Stimpson,
of Cambridge; Mr. Isaac Lea and Mr. G. W. Tryon, of Philadel-
phia; Mr. W. G. Binney, of New Jersey ; Mr. Prime, of New York;
Mr. Busk, of England; and Dr. Steenstrup, of Copenhagen.

The botanical collections, to which several additions have been
made during the past year, are still in charge of Dr. Torrey, of New
York, and Dr. Gray, of Cambridge. The assorting of the rocks
and minerals is carried on in the Institution; and as an auxiliary
work, Mr. Egleston has prepared a general list of mineral species
to facilitate the labelling and exchange of specimens. This will be
printed and distributed to correspondents during the present year.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 37

The additions to the collections of insects, during the year, have
been referred for identification, as usual, to the collaborators in the
line,of entomology, viz: To Baron Osten Sacken, Dr. Le Conte, Dr.
Loew, Dr. Hagen, Dr. Morris, Dr. Clemens, Mr. Edwards, Mr. Nor-
ton, Mr. Scudder, Mr. Ulke, and Mr. Ubhler.

The whole number of entries on the record book of the Smith-
sonian collection, up to the end of 1862, is, according to the statement
of Professor Baird, 74,775, and when it is understood that each entry
is that of a lot which in most cases contains many specimens, some
idea may be formed of the whole number of specimens which have
been collected through the agency of the Institution, and the service
which will be rendered when all these are made available for the
advancement and diffusion of knowledge among men.

The Museum of the Institution consists principally of the type
specimens of the various collections of objects of natural history and
ethnology obtained by the different exploring and surveying expedi-
tions sent out by the government of the United States, as well as by
various special expeditions instituted at the expense of the Smithsonian
fund. These specimens have generally been described, and in many
cases figured in the reports published by Congress, or in the Smith -
sonian or other transactions, and have thus rendered their chief ser-
vice in the way of advancing knowledge. Yet, in view of the future
progress of science, it is important, irrespective of their use for the:
purposes of education, that these specimens should be carefully pre-
served, in order that they may be referred to as the original objects
from which the descriptions were drawn. It often happens that in
the subsequent study of similar specimens from other localities doubts
arise as to some points of the published descriptions, which can only
Le solved by a reference to the original materials, and it is also fre-
quently desirable to re-examine the specimens in relation to some
new point of interest which may have been developed in the course
of more extended investigation.

The additions to the museum should be confined principally to the
type specimens collected and described at the expense of the gen-
eral government, or under the immediate auspices of the Institution.
Iiven thus restricted the specimens will increase in number as rapidly
as that part of the Smithsonian fund, which is taxed for their sup-
port, will permit, and in time they will form of themselves a valu-
able collection of authentic illustrations of the natural history of
America. It is true, as is often urged, that the value of these speci-
38 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

mens would be enhanced by the addition for comparison of corre-
sponding specimens from other parts of the world; but the full
adoption of this extension of the plan would involve the maintenance
of a general museum, which, as has been repeatedly stated, is incom-
patible with the means and design of the Institution.

The only museum at present in this country, expressly established
for the threefold object of popular instruction, systematic study, and
original research, is that at Cambridge, under the direction of Prof.
Agassiz. For the purposes of such a museum specimens of all kinds,
from every part of the earth, are necessary, and in accordance with
the liberal policy by which it has always been governed, the Smith-
sonian Institution has actively co-operated in assisting this exemplary
enterprise of the State of Massachusetts.

During the past year the type specimens of a number of series of
collections, of which the duplicates have been separated for distribu-
ilon, have been transferred to the museum. The work of labelling the
specimens, so that the common as well as the scientific name of each
article may be distinctly exhibited, has been continued, and will pro-
bably be completed before the end of the present year. But for an
account in detail of what has been done in regard to the museum
and the collections, I must refer to the report of Prof. Baird, here-_
with submitted. | |

As a matter of interest, and, in some cases, of importance, a
record book is kept at the principal entrance of the building, in
which the names of all the visitors are entered. Since the date of
the last report the Institution has been visited by thousands of
persons, who have been called by business or pleasure to the national
capital. The specimens of natural history and ethnology have ex-
cited much popular interest, particularly among those who come
from the more distant western portions of the country. The museum
and grounds are a favorite resort for the convalescent soldiers.
The trees and shrubbery of the latter are growing finely, and the
whole park, under the care of the Commissioner of Public Build-
B. B. French, Esq., forms no unworthy memento of the tal-

ings,
ents of the lamented Downing, by whom its plan was designed.

I amsorry, in this connection, to consider it my duty to refer to the
existence of an evil over which, though you have no official control,
yet as legislators and prominent citizens you may exert a beneficial
influence. I allude to the city canal, which forms the boundary of

the Smithsonian grounds on the north. The basin or widest part of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

this canai, across which most of the visitors to the Institution have
to pass, has become, since the introduction of the Potomac water,
the receptacle of the sewage of the city, and is now an immense
cesspool, constantly emitting noxious efiluvia prejudicial to the health
and offensive to the senses of all who approach the locality. This
nuisance, which will continue to increase with the increasing use of the
Potomac water, may perhaps be mitigated by placing a gate at each
end of the wider part of the canal, to be closed after high tide and
opened occasionally at low water, so as to discharge the contents
with a force which would remove, in part, at least, the deleterious
deposit. But the only effectual remedy, as it appears to me, is to
fill up a part of the width of the canal, and convert the remainder
into a sewer by covering it with an arch of masonry. This sewer
may perhaps be cleared out by flood-gates, as before mentioned, or
by anchoring flat-boats at the mouths of the drains, to be removed
and emptied when filled. But whatever plan may be adopted, the
character and prosperity of the city, as well as the interests of the
Institution, are involved in a speedy and eflicient effort to remove
the evil. The small pecuniary benefit which may result from the
canal to the city or to individuals ought not have any weight in the
decision of this matter.

Explorations. —A part of the large collections which have just been
described was gathered through officers and other persons attached
to the surveying and exploring expeditions sent out by the govern-
ment, and another part by expeditions expressly organized for the
purpose, under the immediate auspices of the Institution. Among the
latter is the expedition mentioned in the last two reports as having
been undertaken by Mr. Robert Kennicott, of Chicago.

This enterprise has terminated very favorably, the explorer having
returned richly laden with specimens, after making a series of obser-
vations on the physical geography, ethnology, and the habits of ani-
mals of the regions visited, which cannot fail to furnish materials of
much interest to science.

The route traversed by Mr. Kennicott was from Lake Superior,
along Kamenistiquoy river, and Rainy and Winnipeg lakes, up the
Saskatchewan river to Cumberland House; thence nearly north
through a series of rivers and lakes to Fort Churchill on English
river, up the latter to Methy Portage, at which point he first reached
the headwaters of the streams flowing into the Arctic ocean; thence
AQ REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

along the Clear Water river and Athabasca lake, down Peace river
into Great Slave lake, and along the Mackenzie river to Fort Simpson.
At this place Mr. Kennicott spent a part of the first winter with the
officers of the Hudson’s Bay Company, making excursions up the Liard
river to Fort Liard in autumn, and again on snow shoes in January.
Before the close of the same winter he went up the Mackenzie to Big
island, and thence northwest to Fort Rae, near the site of old Fort
Providence. From this point he travelled on the ice across Great
Slave lake to Fort Resolution, at the mouth of Peace river, where he
spent the summer of 1860. THenext descended the Mackenzie to Peel’s
river, and thence proceeded westward across the Rocky mountains, and
down the Porcupine river to the Youkon, in the vicinity of which he
spent the winter of 1860~61, and the summer of 1861. The winter
of 1861 and’62 was spent at Peel’s river, and La Pierre’s house in the
Rocky mountains, and in travelling from this point up to Fort Simpson
and back to Fort Good Hope on the Mackenzie. He left the last-men-
tioned place on the Ist of June, 1862, and reached home in October.

During the whole exploration he.was the guest of the Hudson’s
Bay Company, the officers of which not only furnished him with free
transportation for the materials he collected, but also extended to him
in the most liberal manner the hospitalities of their several posis, and
facilitated in every way in their power the objects of his perilous
enterprise.

The principal object of the exploration was to collect materials for
investigating the Zoology of the region visited. Mr. Kennicoit,
however, also collected specimens of plants and minerals, and
gave considerable attention*to the ethnology of the country, in ob-
serving the peculiarities of the various Indian tribes, and forming
vocabularies of the languages. He carried with him a number of
thermometers, and succeeded in enlisting a number of persons as
meteorological observers, as well as in exciting an interest in natural
history, and in physical phenomena, which cannot fail to be produc-
tive of important information respecting a region of the globe but
little known.

The contributors to this exploration, besides the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, were the University of Michigan, the Audubon Club of Chicago,
and several private individuals interested in the advance of natural
history.

Mr. Xantus, whose explorations in Lower California have been
. REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Al

mentioned in several of the’previous reports, has been appointed by
the government of the United ‘States consul on the western coast
of Mexico; and in this new and interesting region, I doubt not
that, with unabated zeal, he will be able to add much that is
new and important to the different branches of natural history. To
facilitate his labors in the way of making collections, the Institution
furnished him with a full set of articles necessary for the most efficient
prosecution of a work of this kind.

Exchanges. —The system of exchanges still continues to render im-
portant aid to the literary and scientific intercourse of this country
with other parts of the world. It is not confined on this side of the
Atlantic to the United States, but extends to Canada, the West In-
dies, and South America. From the tabular statement given by Pro-
fessor Baird, it appears that during the year 1862 there have been
sent to foreign countries 1,203 packages, each containing, in most
cases, a number of separate articles. These packages were enclosed
in 114 boxes, measuring in the aggregate upwards of 1,000 cubic feet,
and weighing 28,936 pounds. The number of packages received in
return for parties in this country, exclusive of those for the Institu-
tion, was 2,105, which would on an average amount to upwards of
10,000 articles.

The Institution has received on its own account 5,035 articles, in-
cluding those for the museum as well as for the library.

The thanks of the Institution continue to be due to various parties
for their liberality in transporting boxes and packages free of charge,
er in materially reducing the ordinary expenses. Those claiming
especial mention are the North German Lloyds, between Bremen
and New York, the Hamburg and New York Steamship Line, the
Cunard Line, the Panama Railroad, and the Pacific Mail Steamship
Company, all of which transport Smithsonian packages free of charge.
The Adams’s Express Line transmits our packages partly at reduced
rates and partly free. The magnitude of the favors conferred by
these companies may be readily understood by a reference to the
statement made above that the weight of the packages sent to Europe
alone amounted, during the year 1862, to nearly 30,000 pounds.

Labrary.—The library during the last year has continued steadily
to increase, principally by exchanges, but also by purchase. By ex-
changes there have been received 1,211 octavos, 348 quartos, and 52

rf

folios. Of parts of volumes in octavo 2 441, in quarto, 767, in folio,
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

161, maps and charts, 55, making a total of 5,035 articles. In addi-
tion to these about 500 volumes have been purchased.

A catalogue of transactions and proceedings of learned societies
contained in the library of the Smithsonian Institution was published
in July, 1858, and widely distributed, with a circular requesting that
the deficiencies in the sets might be supplied, and other series be
added to the collection from the duplicates in foreign libraries. This
request has been go liberally complied with, and so many additions
have been made to the collection, that a new edition of the catalogue
has become necessary. This work is nearly ready for the press, and
if the means of the Institution should permit, will be published during
the coming year.

The value of this library will be much enhanced by the publication
of the Systematic Index to all the articles contained in the transac-
tions and proceedings of the learned societies of the world, now in
course of preparation under the supervision of a committee of the
Royal Society of London. This index will include the titles of papers
published by the academies of Russia, Sweden, Denmark, Nether-
lands, Germany, Switzerland, France, Spain, Italy, and the States of
North America. Some idea of the magnitude of the work, says Gen-
eral Sabine, may be formed from the fact, that it begins with the year
1800, and is brought down to the close of the year 1860. The titles
are all in quadruplicate and now form sixty-two manuscript volumes.
It is expected that the index will be completed within the year 1863.
and that it will be published without unnecessary delay. It will be
a work of immense importance to all engaged in scientific pursuits ;
it is difficult to estimate the amount of waste of time and labor of the
student, arising from ignorance of what has already been achieved.in
the several departments of science; and none but one who has en-
deavored in the investigation of perhaps a single subject to explore
the contents of scientific periodicals can judge of the weariness and
discouragements of the search. A copy of this work will undoubtedly
find a place in each of the principal libraries of the United States,
and with the distribution of the catalogue before-mentioned will give
the American student ready reference and access through the Smith-
sonian collection to all the important original papers on scientific sub-
jects which have been published during the present century.

Gallery of Art.—The only additions made to the Gallery of Art
during the past year, have been a bust of Professor Benjamin Silli-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

man, senior, presented by his son, and another of General William H.
Sumner, presented by George Wood, esq., of this city.

The Indian gallery belonging to Mr. Stanley still continues on de-
posit in the Institution. It is to be feared that by reason of the
present condition of the country Congress will not think it advisable to
purchase these characteristic illustrations of the aboriginal inhabitants
of this continent, and it may perhaps become a subject of considera-
tion with the Regents to make some provision for the preservation of
the collection in its integrity, since it is possible that the owner may
otherwise be obliged to dispose of it in parts, in order to meet his
private pecuniary engagements.

Lectures.—On account of the uncertainty of the times and the pre-
occupation of the public mind no arrangements were made to furnish a
course of public Jectures on the part of the Institution for the winter
of 1861-62; but the use of the lecture-room was granted, in accord-
ance with previous custom, to an association consisting principally of
persons connected with the several departments of government to
give a course of lectures in aid of a benevolent object. The privi-
lege was granted, as usual, on the condition definitely expressed,
that subjects of sectarianism in religion and special politics should
not be discussed. But in this case experience proved that it is inju-
dicious to allow the use of the room in times of great public excite-
ment for lectures over which the Institution has no immediate control.

The association could not, or at least did not, observe the restriction
as to subjects, and the whole course became an exposition of political
principles which were then under public discussion both in the pa-
pers of the day and on the floor of Congress. The evil of this was
soon manifest in acrimonious attacks upon the Institution by mem-
bers of Congress and editors of papers holding different political
opinions. It was in vain to attempt to neutralize the effects of
these attacks by stating the fact that the Institution ought not to be
held responsible for the character of these lectures; the public could
not be made to recognize the distinction between the lectures given
under the immediate sanction of the Institution and those which were
permitted to be delivered in the lecture-room under the direction of
other parties.

Upon these considerations and those mentioned in the last re-
port as to the inexpediency of frequently opening the Smithsonian
building at night in the present state of this city, I concluded, after
the course of political lectures was terminated, to restrict the use of
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the lecture-room exclusively to the lectures given under the immediate
auspices of the Institution. This rule at first gave offence to some
of the friends of the Institution, and was considered very unjust by
another association which desired to give a course of political lectures
in opposition to those which had been previously delivered. It
has since, however, been generally approved by the reflecting
public, and, indeed, must commend itself to all who have studied
the history of establishments under the direction of State or
national governments. Unless they are strictly guarded against the
intrusion of political influence, their permanency and usefulness can-
not long be maintained. So much were the Regents composing the
Board, at its first sessions, impressed with this fact, that, at one of
their early meetings, they unanimously adopted the following sugges-
tion of one of their Meeatitioce namely:

‘The party politics of the day, on which men differ so widely and
so warmly, should not, your committee think, enter among the subjects
treated of in any lecture or publication put forth under the sanction
of the Institution. And they would deeply regret to see party tests
and party wranglings obtrude themselves on the neutral grounds of
science and education, endangering, as such intrusion surely would,
the tranquillity of the Institution, disturbing the even tenor of its ac-
tion, perhaps assaulting its welfare, and certainly contracting the
sphere of its usefulness.’’

I need not say to the gentlemen now present, some of whom have
been Regents since the beginning, how strictly the spirit of this reso-
lution has been observed; notwithstanding the members of the Board
from the two Houses of Congress are designedly elected from those
holding opposite political opinions, in this hall the irritations of legis-
lative discussion have been allayed or forgotten, and men of the
most extreme political views have constantly met in this place as on a
common ground of friendly sympathy, actuated apparently by no
other feeling than the desire to guide and sustain the Institution in
its mission of advancing and diffusing knowledge.

To make up for the dissatisfaction which might be felt on account
of the restriction which had been put upon the use of the lecture-
room, it was thought advisable to give in the winter of 186263 a more
extended series of lectures than had been given in the two preceding
winters, but to confine them principally to courses on scientific and
other subjects, which might be of service to those who desired actual
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

instruction rather than mere amusement; although the attendance
. was not as large as in the case of the single lectures or the more ex-
citing topics of the day, yet it was well maintained and comprised an
attentive and decorous audience.

The following are the courses which were delivered, namely:

A course of six lectures, by Professor Daniel Wilson, of the University
of Toronto, on ‘‘Unwritten History,’’ embracing, Ist, Archeology;
2d, Phy siolog ay; 3d, The Lettered Races; 4th, The Maritime Races;
5th, The Origin of Civilization, and 6th, The Historic and Unhis-
toric Races.

APPENDIX TO THE REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, December 31, 1862.

Sir: I beg leave herewith to present a report, for 1862, of the operations
intrusted to my charge, namely, those relating to printing, exchanges, and
natural history.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
SPENCER F. BAIRD,
Assistant Secretary Smithsonian Institution.

Prof Joserpu Henry, L.L.D.,

Sceretary Smithsonian Institution.

PRINTING.

Tn an appendix will be found a list of the works published in 1862—the num-
ber of pages pzinted, quarto and octavo, greatly exceeding that reported for
1861. Several large works are also in press and will be issued early in 1863.

‘The following enumeration will show the number of pages printed during

the year:

A complete catalogue of all works published by the Institution up to June,
1862, was issued during the year, and will be found included in the list of
articles published.

Ail the octavo publications of the Institution hitherto issued, and of which
copies enough were.on hand, have been arranged in a regular series, entitled
“Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections,” correspouding to the “Smithsonian
Contributions to Knowledge,” and fill four volumes of over seven hundred
pages cach. An accompanying list shows the contents of these several volumes.
REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY. 47

EXCHANGES AND TRANSPORTATION.

The operations in the department of exchanges, as reported for 1861, showed
a considerable reduction below those of the previous year. During 1862,
however, they have fully recovered their usual magnitude, and while the receipts
of books and parecls from abroad are nearly equal to the maximum of any
previous year, the transmissions have been greater than usual.

The thanks of the Institution and its correspondents continue to be due to
various companies for their great liberality in transporting boxes and parcels
free of charge over their respeetive routes, thereby reducing very materially
the expenses of the department of exchanges. The lines deserving of especial
mention are the North German Lloyd, between Bremen and New York; the
Hamburg and New York steamship line; the Cunard lines, running from New
York; the Panama Railroad Company; the Pacific Mail Steamship Company ;
the Adams’s Express Company; the ILudson Bay Company, &c. ‘lhe magni-
tude of the favors thus conferred may be readily understood by stating that a
single trausmission of packages to Germany during the year, through the North
German Lloyd, consisted of 46 boxes of 424 cubic feet, or over ten tons by
measurement.

The Institution is under many obligations for important services rendered in
connexion with its exchanges and transportation, to the Hon. Hiram Barney,
collector of customs in New York, and his assistant, Mr. George Hillier. Also
in San Francisco, to Mr. A. B. Forbes, and Mr. Samuel Hubbard, of the Pa-
cific Mail Steamship Company’s service. ‘The foreign agents of the Insti-
tution, Dr. Felix Fliigel, of Leipsic; Gustave Bossange & Co., Paris, and Mr.
William Wesley, 2 Queen’s Head Passage, Paternoster Row, London, continue
to discharge their duties with promptness and efficiency.

The following tables exhibit the statistics of the different branches of the
system of exchanges:

MUSEUM AND COLLECTIONS.

As might have been expected, the receipts of specimens of natural history
during the year past have been materially curtailed. The entire number of
donations in 1862 amounted to 124. The number for 1861 was 157, while that
for 1860 was 404. Much of interest has, however, been received from different
quarters, and the aggregate would have been more considerable if all the col-
lections made in the Hudson Bay region by Mr. Kennicott, and other gentle-
men, had not been kept back in consequence of the Indian outbreaks in Minne-
sota during the year.

Mr. Kennicott spent the spring and summer of 1861 at Fort Yukon, on the
Yukon river, making large collections of specimens. He wintered on the Rocky
mountains, at La Pierre’s house, and made a visit to Fort Simpson early in the
spring. News received there from home determined him to return to the United
States, and he reached Fort Garry the beginning of September, arriving at
Chicago in October, after an absence of three years and a half. A detailed
report of his expedition will be prepared by himself, and submitted hereafter.

The gentlemen of the Hudson’s Bay Company, of whom mention has here-
tofore been made as aiding him in every way, have continued their kind offices.
To Governor Dallas, present governor of the Hudson’s Bay Company, Gover-
nor Mactavish, Mr. Bernard R. Ross, Mr. Lawrence Clark, Mr. R. Mac Farlane,
Mr. W. L. Hardisty, Mr. James Lockhart, Mr. C. P. Gaudet, Mr. James Flett,
and others, the thanks of the Institution are very especially due for such aid to
Mr. Kennicott as ensured the success of his expedition, and without which
he could have accomplished little or nothing.

To most of the gentlemen above referred to acknowledgments have been
made in previous reports for valuable contributions of specimens. Collections
made by them in 1862, having been packed with those of Mr. Kennicott, have
not yet arrived, but are expected early in the year 1863, as, at the last advices,
they had reached St. Paul.

Mr. John Xantus, so well known on account of his scientific researches in
California, in connexion with the Institution, has just entered into a new and
entirely unexplored field, promising the most important results. Having been
appointed United States consul at Manzanillo, he left New York on the 11th of
December, and is doubtless now at his post. With their usual liberality, exer-
cised so often before in the interest of science and the Smithsonian Institution,
the Panama Railroad Company and the Pacific Mail Steamship Company gave
free passage to him and his extensive outfit.

IDENTIFICATION OF SPECIMENS.

Much progress has been made by the various gentlemen mentioned on page
62 of the last report in identifying and labelling the collections of the Institu-
tion. It will not be long before the greater portion will be thoroughly worked

p, and a general distribution of duplicates accomplished. No new collections
of any importance have been given out, although Mr. Cope expects to take up
the North American saurians belonging to, the Institution with the view of pre-
paring a report on the subject.

Dr. Allen having completed the examination of the American bats intrusted
to him, as far as his professional engagements would allow, has returned the
specimens, and deposited a report on the subject, nearly finished, and to be
hereafter completed by him. Dr. Wood has also returned a portion of the col-
lection of Myriapoda. Dr. Slack has sent back the collection of monkeys, with a
catalogue of the collection. Mr. George N. Lawrence has labelled the entire
56 REPORT OF THE ASSISTANT SECRETARY.

collection of humming birds, amounting to over 150 species. Professor Agassiz
has determined and returned the collection of Kehini.

Mr. Gill has continued his examinations of the fishes of Cape St. Lucas, col-
lected by Mr. Xantus, and published many new species from them.

DISTRIBUTION OF SPECIMENS,

The Cistribution of duplicate specimens has been continued as fully as time
and opportunity would allow. Several large collections of mammals, birds, and
eggs have been sent off, together with a considerable number of sets of marine
shells. Dr. Foreman has been engaged for some time in making up the duplicate
Unionidae into series, of which about twenty sets will soon be ready.

WORK DONE IN THE MUSEUM.

The mounted mammals and birds which occupied the Museum Hall at the
beginning of the year have all been identified, and to most of them neatly writ-
ten labels have been affixed. This portion of the work will be completed as
soon as the clerk assigned to the duty can accomplish it. All the specimens
have been carefully examined, and those attacked by insects have been re-
moved and baked or exposed to the vapor of benzine. A few skins have
been mounted of species possessing a particular interest.

‘The collection of skulls has been cleaned and rearranged in the southeast gal-
lery. The series of rocks, and in part that of minerals, have been placed on
their proper shelves. Nothing further has been done with the shells, the col-
lections in this department not having been returned by the gentlemen having
them in charge.

All the miscellaneous boxes of specimens in the Institution have been un-
packed and their contents assorted and distributed. All the crude material in
the building has thus been put into condition for examination, and given out to
investigators for arrangement, with the exception of a portion of . the fossils and
the general ethnological collection. ‘These will, however, all be unpacked and
examined in the ensuing year.

The progress of work upon the collections already in the Institution at the
beginning of the year was much interfered with by the necessity of receiving a
large number of specimens formerly belonging to the National Institute, and
sent from the Patent Office (where they had been stored) by the Commissioner
of Patents. Much of this material was in an exceedingly damaged condition,
requiring instant attention and much labor to preserve it in even tolerable con-
dition.

The cataloguing of specimens in the record books of the Institution has been
carried forward during the year by the insertion of nearly 10,000 additional
entries, many of them covering each a number of specimens. The present ag-
gregate of entries is about 75,000, embracing at least 500,000 or half a million
of specimens. When it is remembered that none of the plants, and insects, and
but few of the fishes and invertebrates, have yet been recorded in this way,
some estimate may be formed of the extent and value of the material for re- -
search in charge of the Smithsonian Institution.

It will he seen that the whole income during the year 1862 was $35,425 51,
instead of the estimated income, $34,666 14. This difference is due to the
receipt of $759 37 as premium on the gold in which the first half year’s interest
on the Indiana bonds was paid.

The expenditures during 1862 were $27,961 07, leaving $7,464 44 to be
added to the balance in the hands of the treasurer on the 9th of January, 1862.

The amount of bills for work already contracted for will not exceed $2,500.

The foregoing statement is an actual exhibit of the Smithsonian funds, irre-
spective of credits and payments which have been made in behalf of other
parties. Jor example, the Institution during the past year has paid several
bills for work done on account of the government, the amount of which has
been refunded and credited to the appropriations from which the expenditure
was originally made.
REPORT OF COMMITTEE. CF

The appropriation from Congress for the preservation of the collections of the
exploring and surveying expeditions of the United States has been expended,
as heretofore, under the direction of the Secretary of the Interior, in assisting
to pay the expenses of extra assistants in the museum, and the cost of arrang-
ing and preserving the specimens. ‘The‘sum received from this source has been
credited to the museum, and has served to diminish the amount of expenditures
for that object on the part of the Institution, although it has not been sufficient
to defray all the expenses on account of the preservation and public exhibition
of the specimens.

The articles intrusted to the care of the Institution are in good condition,
and the work of the distribution of the duplicates of the government as well as
those of the Institution is still in progress.

A part of the expenditure on the building is due to refitting the apparatus
room, and re-covering, with tin, the northesn portion of the roof of the west con-
necting range which was blown off during the storm of February 24.

From the foregoing statements it will appear that the financial affairs of the
Institution are still in a prosperous condition, and that the Board of Regents
could resign their trust to-day, with the undiminished original bequest of
Smithson in the treasury of the United States, with over one hundred thousand
dollars on hand or in secure investments, and with $66,000 in southern State
stocks, from which it is hoped at some future time interest may be received.

80 * PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.

The Sceretary presented to the Board the following communications :

War DEPARTMENT,
Washington City, January 26, 1863.

Sir: I have this day requested Hiram Barney, esq., collector of the port of
New York, to send to you the books, maps, papers, and other articles, now in
his possession, taken by the United States forces in South Carolina, to be held
in the Smithsonian Institution, subject to the orders of this department. I
would be pleased to confer with you in regard to this matter if you will be so
good as to call at this department Tuesday, at three o’clock p. m.

I am, sir, very respecttully, your obedient servant,
EDWIN M. STANTON,
Secretary of War.
Professor Josepu HEnrRy,
Sceretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

War DEPARTMENT,
Washington City, January 29, 1863.

Str: The Secretary of War directs that you take possession of the books and
papers of Bishop John Johns, at his late residence at Fairfax Seminary, and
transmit them under sufficient guard to Professor Henry, at the Smithsonian
Institution, in this city.

Very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant,
EDWARD CANBY,

Brigadier General United States Volunteers.

Brigadier General J. P. SLoucu,
United States Volunteers, Military Governor of Alexandria.

Professor Henry stated that in his interview with the Secretary of War the
latter had requested that an inventory of the books, &c., should be made, and
that they should be carefully preserved in a room by themselves. The Secre-
tary, on behalf of the Regents, provisionally agreed to these propositions on
condition that the expense of the shelving and fitting up of the room, and the
preparation of the list, should be at the expense of the government.

The Board of Regents acquiesced in the propriety of taking charge of these
libraries, and of carefully preserving them until the termination of \the present
war.

The Seeretary stated that the libraries had been received—the one from
South Carolina, in thirty-three boxes and one bundle, by the transportation
company from New York, and that of Bishop Johns, in loose volumes, by army
wagons from Alexandria. It is proposed to place these libraries in the unoc-
cupied apartment in the south tower above the Regents’ room.

The following extracts from the correspondence of the Institution were then
presented, after which the Board adjourned, to meet again, if necessary, at the
call of the Secretary.

WESTERN UNION TELEGRAPH ComPANy,
_ Secretary’s Office, Rochester, N. Y., April 21, 1862.

Dear Sir: Your favor of the 15th instant, enclosing circular, is received.
T recommend that you get one hundred copies of your circular printed and send
them to E. Creighton, esq., Superintendent of the Pacifie Telegraph, Omaha,
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 81

Nebraska Territory. Mr. Creighton will see them distributed along the line
at the proper places, and will renew the same from time to time with his instrue-
tions. You will please give him particular directions so as to secure what you
want.

I would like to have you send mea few copies after they are printed, that I may
assist you in getting the several telegraph companies between Brownsville, in
Missouri, and Washington, to transmit for you free this class of business for a
limited time at least.

I have written to Mr. Creighton and sent him your circular, but as many
copies will be required they had better be printed, as I suggest.

Yours, truly,”
HIRAM SIBLEY,
President Western Union Telegraph Company.

The following is the circular referred to in the preceding letter, which has
been distributed to the telegraph offices on the line between Missouri and
California: i

Directions for telegraphing storms to the Smithsonian Institution, Washington.
oO oO ’ So

Violent storms usually come from the west—therefore, after a storm ‘+has com-
menced, send a telegram eastward, giving
1. The time of beginning of storm.
2. Direction of the wind.
3. Character of the storm, whether wind, rain, snow.

After the storm is over, send the following :

4. Time of ending of storm.
5. Changes of the wind.
6. Changes of temperature.

In accordance with this arrangement the Institution has received occasionally
notices of storms commencing in the Rocky mountains, and even in California.

—_—_— ’

Sr. Louis, August 14, 1862.

Dear Sir: I believe I have before informed you of Dr. Parry’s botanical
exploration in the Colorado Territory. I have now a long series of barometrical
observations made by him on the different points visited by him, and among
them the snow peaks Mount Guyot and Pike’s Peak. |

From a preliminary calculation I find that the latter rises above Fontaine
qui bouit, at its base, about 7,700 feet; the fountain itself Frcmont finds 6,350,
and I about 6,500, so that the peak is doubtless in the neighborhood of 14,000
feet, “snow-capped, but easy of access.”’ The timber reaches to within 2,200 feet
of the top. Mount Guyot is found to be about 13,000 fect high ; Berthoud’s
Pass, 11,400, (all timbered.)

These results, which I think are approximatively correct, show the great
elevation of the base of the mountains, (Denver, 5,300 feet; Mount Vernon,
6,400 feet;) the great clevation of the peaks, and the great height of the limit
of timber. 10,000 to 12,000 feet seems to be that limit between forty and thirty-
five degrees latitude in the Rocky mountains. ;

Very respectfully, yours,
GEORGE ENGELMANN.

Professor HENRY.

82 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.

The following remarks relative to this letter have been received from Professor
Guyot, to whom it was submitted:

«T return to you, with my thanks for its communication, the interesting letter
of Dr. Engelmann. I had become acquainted with a part of that information
by a lctter from himself. It is exceedingly gratifying to see that interesting
field of labor beginning to be explored. I trust that Dr. Parry will be able to
continue his useful investigations.

' “A creat desideratum for the mountain measurements of the far west is the
determination of some points near the base of the great chains with some degree
of accuracy. We would obtain such points by afew regular baromctric stations.
Could not an observer be found in Denver or Colorado City, for instance, who
would at the same time furnish suitable corresponding observations for measure-
ments in the mountains, which are indispensable for the accurate determination
of the high peaks of the Rocky mountains? It is rather provoking to have the
consciousness that we do not know the true altitude of any point in these
2,000 miles of inland country, within one or two hundred feet, to say the least.

“T suppose that the barometric correction by Plantamour, mentioned in the
report of the proceedings of the British Association, relates to the influence of the
hour of the day at which barometric measurements are made, as derived from
the means of St. Bernard and Geneva. It is the correction the amount of which
1 tried to determine in the latitude of the Black mountain and elsewhere, and
which I apply in all my measurements. It amounts to 745 of the difference
measured, in the hottest part of the day, above the mean, or 3}; if we take the
daily extremes. It is thus of considerable importance, though usually neglected.
I think, however, that the whole needs a considerable revision. ‘i'emperature
is the main cause, but the diurnal variation of pressure also comes in with con-
trary effects.”

Unitep States NATIONAL OBSERVATORY,
Washington City, January 8, 1862.

Dear Sir: You are, I believe, aware that for some time past I have been
engaged in investigations relative to Biela’s comet. In the course of these
investigations I have collected and discussed all the observations that could be
found for each of the recorded six appearances, and, by help of independent
elliptic elements for cach, have digested these observations into a series of
twenty-five normal places, extending though, with wide intervals, from 1772 to
1852. I have also computed rigorously the effect of planetary perturbations
from 1846 to 1858, and am now engaged in continuing this computation to the
next return in 1865. Moreover, I have carefully studied the relative motions
of the two nuclei into which the comet is now divided, and find that the time
and place of their separation can be indicated with a good degree of approx-
imation, thus limiting the field of possible causes of the catastrophe.

It was my expectation, at the outset, to have extended the calculation‘of
perturbations over the whole interval from 1772, so as to unite, if possible, by
a single theory, all the observed places of the comet; but a nearer contempla-
tion of this task, and a little actual trial, show that with my present official
duties this would be a work of many years. It has occurred to me, however,
that it would be in accordance with the plans of the Smithsonian Institution, |
and in keeping with the generous interest it has always shown in scientific
investigations, to assist in this work by enabling me to employ a computer, to
whom can be intrusted the more mechanical details of calculation. I venture,
then, to suggest this proposition to you, and if, as I would fain hope, it should
meet your approval, and you authorize me to enter into such an arrangement,
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 83

I will gladly resume the work in accordance with my original plan, and with
renewed hopes of success.
Trusting to hear from you on the subject, I am, respectfully and truly
yours,
J. 8. HUBBARD.
Professor HENRY.

The investigations to which the foregoing communication relates are of a
highly interesting character, and well worthy the assistance of the Smithsonian
Institution. The prosecution of the work has, however, for the present been
suspended.

West Curster, Pa., October 31, 1862.

Dear Sir: For the last two or three years I have been employing and
amusing the leisure hours of my old age in collecting materzals for brief notices
of men and events in my native county of Chester, in the State of Pennsylvania.
I obtained imperfect accounts of about one hundred and thirty men of the
county, who, in their day and generation, had acquired some character and
consequence among their contemporaries of the province from its first settle-
ment, under the auspices of William Penn, down to the present time. ‘Those
materials were, indeed, very defective, owing to the culpable indifference and
negligence of our ancestors in preserving them. But, such as they were, I
endeavored to make the best use I could of them, and caused them to be printed
in numbers, under the title of Noragk CESTRIENSES, in a newspaper of this
village., I cut the articles from the paper as they were published, and arranged
copies of them, in numerical order, in three several scrap-books for preserva-
tion and convenient reference. One of these scrap-books I shall deposit in the
library of the Chester County Cabinet; another will be deposited in the library
of the Pennsylvania Historical Society, at Philadelphia; and the third I pro-
pose, with your permission, if you can allow it the space it‘may occupy, to
put in the library of the Smithsonian Institution, at Washington, with the view
and hope that in each of those depositories, the said Norar may be accessible
to any and every one who may have curiosity enough to wish to refer to them.

My humble memorials of the men of Chester are very meagre; yet, when I
review them, and consider how careless and indifferent our people have been in
such matters, I am surprised even at my own success in gathering my inade-
quate materials for the undertaking, scattered as they were over so extensive a
district.

I am, dear sir, your feeble yet faithful octogenarian friend,
WILLIAM DARLINGTON.
Prof. JosppH HENry.

The foregoing letter is from our much respected and esteemed correspondent
the venerable Dr. William Darlington, of West Chester, Pennsylvania. It
relates to a work performed in,the evening of a long and laborious life, devoted
to the advance of science and the practice of Chiistian love and charity. Its
publication may induce others to render a like service to their neighborhood,
and thus increase the inducements to well doing through the desire inseparably
connected with our instincts of a futwre—to live favorably in the memory of
those who may succeed us. (Since this letter was presented to the board Dr,
Darlington has departed this life. T£e died on his eighty-first birth-day, April,
1863.)
$4 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.

Paris, November 24, 1862.

Dear Sir: Mr. Hermann de Schlagintweit has enclosed me this note for
you, asking me to add something as an introduction, which is scarcely neces-
sary, seeing that he is one of the ‘brothers Schlagintweit whose labors in Thibet
and high India are so familiar to us. Those of the specimens I have seen are
highly | interesting, and the fact that they were collected by the Schlagintweits in
person gives them a full guarantee.

Your obedient servant,

THEODORE LYMAN.

“ Municu, (Bavaria,) November 7, 1862.

Dear Sir: Some days ago I had the pleasure of making the acquaintange
of Mr. Theodore Lyman, who gave me ene interesting facts respecting your
Institution, and especially about your important prectical and scientific meteo-
rological researches. He also gaye me a most lively description of the extent
and the variety of the collections of the Institution: As he has kindly given
me an introduction to you, I take the liberty of addressing you this communi-
cation relative to such parts of our collections of ethnography and natural his-
tory as we are now about to dispose of.

Of the objects mentioned in the accompanying statement, Mr. Lyman has
seen but few, but sufficient, I trust, to enable him to give you more particulars
as to their character if it should be desired, especially as he has had Professors
Kaup and Siebold’s opinion of them.

Besides one objects of natural history, I may mention the photographic col-
ored fac-similes of a She number of my water-color drawings, their number
amounting to 125, and including only such objects as are not among the plates
published i in our atlas. Mr. Brockhaus has made several series for England,
one for Paris; and two for India, but has a few still remaining in his hands.
The price he charges is 70 thalers, or £10, for thirty views, or £40 for the

series. Mr. Lyman has scen them, and will perhaps be good enough to let you
know in a few words how they are executed, as my dceen iption might too easily
be influenced by the fact that I made the originals myself, or wor! ced over those
made by my brother Adolphe.
My address for this winter will be: Dultplatz 10, Munich, Bavaria.

CHRISTIANIA, January 6, 1863.

Str: The knowledge of the countries and nations of the earth being particu-
larly useful as well to the mariner as to the trader, it ought to be especially
cultivated by us Norwegians. One of the most effective means of calling forth
the sympathies of the people in behalf of a science is that of establishing public
museums, or collections of objects, presenting immediately to ue eye things of
which no accurate idea or conception can be conveyed by a nere description.
The public having thus, so to say, intuitively acquired a fee Tae of interest in
the subject, it will be possible, by united efforts, in the course of some years, to
bring together collections not only instructive to the nation possessing them, but
also deserving the admiration of foreigners.

The British government has in this respect set the greatest example. * * *

An ethnological museum having now been established at the University of
Christiania with the object of il llustrating the manners, mode of living, and civ-
ilization of the various nations, it is to be hoped that the numerous ‘and enter-
prising class of Norwegian seamen will avail themselves of the many opportu-
nities offered on distant voyages to procure objects of interest for such a common
national depository. ‘The managers of the collection have already had frequent
occasions to express their thanks even to common sailors for gifts to the institu-
tion, for which the state has also set apart a sum that, although moderate, will
enable the managers to refund expenses incurred in procuring objects for the
museum. Thus it will be within the. power of any seaman to contribute towards
enlarging the collection.

Trusting to the kind support of the public also for the future, the managers
consider Te expedient to lay down some rules for the guidance of those who, ace
the sake of public utility, may be willing thus to contribute towards enlighten-
ing an fellow citizens:

. The nations and countries, the condition and state of which it will be of
stHe ticular interest to see illustrated and exhibited, are especially those most
differing from our own country and our own people; consequently, in the
first place, the nations out of: Kurope, and, among the Huropeans, those
least known, and of the most antiquated manners. As a rule, objects of
antiquity are also of greater rarity, and will be more acceptable to a col-
lection than things now in use.
2. The objects, suitable for illustrating the condition of such nations, are in-
* mnumerable. Sacred images, weapons, tools used in the principal trades,
clothing, furniture, domestic implements, and products of industry, may be
mentioned. Of course, models, drawings, and especially photographs, will
atford quite as trustworthy information as the object itself. Articles liable
to spoil, or the preservation of which would involve expenses, cannot be
received in a museum.
3. The limited means at the disposal of a Norwegian institution will, as a
matter of course, necessitate the selection of articles the price of which is
86 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.

not excessive. ‘The exhibition of objects of silver or gold or of regal lux-
uries is also, in fact, of less importance than illustrating the condition of
the people itself.

4. In order, however, that the objects of interest to a museum may be applied
according to their purpose—illustrating the nature of a country or the mode
of living of the people—it will be necessary that every article forwarded
be accompanied by an accurate account of where it was procured ; by what
nation used or made; in what way used, and for what purpose intended.

In order to give this request due publicity, it is desirable not only to assist in

distributing these lines to those who may be supposed willing to advance the
interests of the Institution, but also, perhaps even more so, to make the subject
known by personally applying to such acquaintances as are able to procure
articles of interest.

I remain, sir, yours, very respectfully,

LOUIS KR. DAA.

Tn answer to this circular, the directors of the Museum of Christiania have
been informed that the Smithsonian Institution will co-operate with them by
contributing ethnological specimens from its own collections, and by forwarding
articles of a similar character which may be presented by others.

Newark, Onto, December 8, 1862.

Dear Sir: In the last report of the Regents I notice the Smithsonian In-
stitution proposes to prepare a map of that portion of the United States in which
aboriginal antiquities are found. Feeling it to be the duty of every one to
contribute -to the general fund of knowledge, I take this opportunity of calling
attention to two classes of archeological remains, which I have studied cursorily,
and have not seen described in any work on the subject.

1. Remains of ancient cities and villages in Missouri. I have seen many of
these. Whether large or small, they are similar in character. The remains
consist of a series of tumuli, from one to two fect in height, and varying from
sixteen to twenty-four feet square. ‘These tumuli are in straight lines or rows,
some numbering hundreds, and others, as of villages, tens; the rows cross each
other at right angles, and the little mounds vary from four to cight rods apart.
On digging into these mounds broken pieces of pottery are found, such as ate
commen to all the antiquities of.the country. In one instance an entire vessel
was turned up. About the centre of cach tumulus charcoal and ashes are found.
Y have examined several, and the pottery, charcoal and ashes are constants in
all I have opened. Fredericktown, in Madison county, Missouri, seems to have
been the site of a considerable city, extending from a branch of the Castor creck,
which flows east of the village to near the east fork of the St. Francis, on the
west, being perhaps a mile and a half long and a mile wide from north to south.

2. A different class of tumuli are common in southern Tennessce. ‘The first
I observed at the site of old Fort Pickering, two miles below Memphis. It isa
paraliclogram, some 15 to 20 feet high, 120 feet long by some 60 wide, and
surrounded by a great many smaller works, just traccable, of various ‘fancies
and designs. I examined this in the winter of 1847—’48. Last spring I visited
the site of the battle of Shiloh. This system of antiquities was very abundant
there, but not so large as the one near Memphis. In a walk of half a mile I
counted eleven of these parallelograms, generally 60 feet long and 25 wide on
the top. Several of them were appropriated to the burial of our dead, killed
in the battle of Shiloh. The smaller works are innumerable, and are generally
circles. I found them all on the west bank of the Tennessee river; and the
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 87

most interesting on the south side of Owl creek. I noticed one at the
village of Savannah, and a very remarkable circular mound, raised by a gradual
and equal slope from all sides to the centre, which (the centre) I judged to be
about 3 feet higher than the sides, and the diameter of the whole about 100 feet.
I regretted that I had not more leisure to devote to the study of these singular
antiquities, but my mission was one of mercy, and afforded me little time for
antiquarian research or speculation.

When peace shall be restored to our distracted country, it would be well for
some one or association to pursue a systematic and thorough examination of
all our antiquities, and to trace the progress of those remains from the rude
structures in Canada, south to Central America; for, from my own observations,
I am satisfied that these remains attest a gradual improvement of the race or
races that constructed them from the north to the south. The Missouri cities
and villages were doubtless mere mud huis, and perhaps adobes, such as still
are used in northern and New Mexico, which in central and southern: Mexico
and Central America are improved into structures of solid masonry, with sculp-
tures and hieroglyphies. Whether these were all the work of one race of men
ealled by some the mound-builders, or of several distinet races, may never be
taiisfactorily settled ; but a systematic study of the whole will afiord an in-
seresting chapter in the unwritten history of man.

Truly yours,
I. DILLE.

VALPARAISO, September 17, 1862.

Dear Sir: In reply to your esteemed favor of the 23d July, I beg leave to
state, what I had omitted in my former communication, that the case of
skulls, &c., from Patagonia, was forwarded by me to the care of the United
States an at Panama, by the British mail steamer, expenses thereon paid
by me in advance as far as Panama. -1I would gladly have done so to the port
of delivery, but found no means of efiecting it. By this time I shall hope that
they are 1n your possession. Sinee you aathiase an interest in the subject, ut
‘shall take an early opportunity of forwarding to the Institute the specimen of

an Atacama mummy—one which I found myself several years ago in the
neighborhoed of the voleano of that name, and which [I lefi deposited with a
friend. I have ordered it to be sent to the coast, along with the utensils and
articles of dress and use that were found with the body. At the.same time
I shall take the Liberty of adding a few observations explanatory of the cireum-
stances under which these relics are ecncially found, and the probable origin of
the custom. ;

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

261 GREENE STREET, New York,
November 7, 186
Dear Sir: I enclose herewith a draft of the proposed circular (auilolgeaaa
accompanied by the alphabet drawn up by Professor Whitney, and the standard
comparative vocabulary used by Gallatin and Hale. It was at first my inten-
88 : PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.

tion to modify and enlarge the latter, but on a full review of the subject,
including a list of proposed words, and on consultation with Mr. Shea, I con-
cluded not to do so without reference to yourself. With certain defects it is
yet a very judicious selection, and it has already been used so largely that a
change may now be injudicious. Still, if you think best, I will advise with
Shea, Squier, and Bartlett, and with them prepare a catalogue of additional
words as an appendix. I am of opinion, however, that the instructions will lead
collectors in the right track.

I had also intended to have the circular translated into ‘French here, but the
health of the person from whom I expected, this assistance is too bad to allow
him to do it at present, and I do not wish to detain it longer. I would recom-
mend that a translation be made into Spanish, (Mexican,) French, and German,
both of this circular, if adopted, and the one on archeology. 'Yo save trouble
with the vocabulary, I send a duplicate blank. ‘There are many French priests
both in:the Hudson’s Bay country and in Oregon; the Spanish, or rather Mexi-
can, priests in New Mexico, California, and elsewhere, may prove valuable
assistants, and among the Germans, even many soldiers in ,the army, are excel-
lently fitted to collect, and well disposed to do so. It will be well to send a
number, say one hundred copies, to the Bureau of Indian Affairs, to be distributed
among the agents; an additional hundred to the Bureau of Topographical Engi-
neers; a like number to the Surveyor General of the Land Office, for the use of
his department; and to the Secretaries of State and of the Navy, for distribution
among our consuls and officers bound to the western coast of Mexico, and-else-
where. ‘The governor of the Hudson’s Bay Company can, I presume, be also
interested in the subject, and though last, not least, the governor of Russian
America.

One thing that eseaped my memory in preparing the archological circular,
was to say that due credit would be given to collectors. It will be better, how-
ever, if you prefix the whole by an official notice emanating from yourself to
this effect. An acknowledgment from the head of an institution like th
Smithsonian is a great inducement to exertion.

I see in the last annua] report Mr. Morgan’s circular respecting an areheo-
logical map. HH you recoilect, this was one of the points which I proposed to
embrace in my work. I think not only of: preparing a genera! map of North
America, embodying the great families, but special maps of particular districts
inhabited by a large’ number of tribes, inciuded in a few families, who live
within a small space. Such are Russian and British America, Washington
Territory, Oregon, and California, for all of which I possess minute information.
Mr. Bartlett has furnished me with the ranges of the New Mexican and ‘Texan
tribes, and I have material from other sources covering other parts of the
country. Of course, all this, with the consent of the bureau, will belong to the
Smithsonian, and I have no wish to monopolize the merit of such a work; but
as I know that no one else possesses the material that I do, at least of the
country west of the Rocky mountains, I should be unwilling to relinquish to
another so important a task. Besides this, until the comparison of the languages
is completed, the ethnological part of the map cannot be perfected.

' I would, therefore, suggest that skeleton maps be issued, as soon as prepared,
to various persons interested in ethnology, and who are familiar with particular
regions, to be filled up with such information as they may possess, to be after,
wards reduced, giving to each the credit of his contributions. Mr. Shea, Mr.

- Bartlett, General Charles P. Stone, Mr. Buckingham Smith, Dr. Hayden, and
other gentlemen, can all add largely to such a work. I have already trans-
mitted departmental maps to each Territory, under the sanction of the Indian
bureau. Permit me, further, to recommend that the proposed map should
extend far enough north to embrace all the EKsquimaux tribes; and west, to take
in the sedentary P'chuktchi or Namollos of Russian Asia.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 89

T am very much afraid that the amount of information proposed to be con-
tained in the ethnological map will render it confused. I would suggest whether
it would not be better to have tao maps—one showing the character of the
country, whether forest or prairie, desert or arable, with the isothermal lines, &c ;
the other, its counterpart, containing merely the principal topographical features,
such as the rivers and main chains of mountains, upon which the boundaries
and names of the tribes and local names should appear. 'The first might indeed
have designated upon it the boundaries of the families, but should not be colored.
Lhe latter to be colored and show the tribal subdivisions.

Begging to apologize for the length of this communication, I am, very truly,
your obedient servant,

GEORGE GIBBS.

Professor JosrpH HENry,

Secretary Smithsonian Institution, Washington.

Novemeser 18, 1862.

In regard to the proposed map of the continent mentioned in your letter of
‘the 13th, I have the honor to submit the following suggestions : ‘Che prepara-
tion of-a base map to serve for these various uses is a subject of the greatest
interest to every one concerned in scientific pursuits, and will form a lasting
monument of the wisdom and efliciency of the Smithsonian Institution. The
urgent need of such a one is evident from the fact that I have been unable
to procure in this city a tolerably correct and recent map, embracing the whole
continent on a scale of convenient size for ethnological purposes, and have actu-
ally been compelled to send to Germany for one, The scale recommended by
Mr. Morgan strikes me as very suitable. In my remarks upon his propositions
J meant only to object to. the introduction upon a strictly ethnological map of
the details of topography, meteorology, and hypsometry. My own idea, in
which I am supported by other gentlemen engaged in the same pursuit, is, that
an ethnological map should exhibit the principal features of the country, the
rivers, moyntain chains, and particularly the passes in the mountains, and the
great Indian trails, where the nature of the country was such as to render these
fixed and distinct; that it should also have the nomenclature fully given, in the
popular form to enable collectors in the field to decide upon exact localities, but in
such a type as to distinguish the popular from the true Indian names. Where,
as I shall presently suggest, sectional maps on a larger scale are prepared, this
nomenclature may, however, better be confined on the general map to a few main
objects, such as the larger rivers, in order to avoid perplexity. Political divi-
sions should be as few as possible and faintly indicated. Indeed, in an ethno-
logical point of view, they are almost worthless, as ours are generally arbitrary
and not founded on geographical features.

Besides this general map, I would also have-a series of maps on a larger
scale, comprising particular sections of country, having direct reference to
the distribution of tribes and familics. ‘Thus, for instance, one map might
show the country occupied by the different tribes of the Dakota, another of the
Snake or Shoshonee, &c. The advantage of this would be, that whereas in the
general map a single color must be used to indicate a great family, composed ot
numerous tribes, and its subdivisions could not be indicated without leading to
confusion, these collateral maps could be made to exhibit the districts occupied
by each. This is very important where the languages spoken by various tribes
differ greatly, as among the Snakes, the Bannak from the Ute, and that from ,
the Comanche. The scale on which these sub-maps should be constructed
would vary greatly, depending upon two points: first, the number of tribes oc-
cupying a given region; second, upon the amount of minute information likely
to be acquired. On the western coast of America, or that district lying between
the Cascade and Sierra Nevada mountains and the sea, there are a great number
90 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS:

of tribes, speaking quite a number of absolutely different languages, and of
some of thes se there are various dialects, differing sufficiently to require de-
signation. Having fixed and permanent villages, their nomenclature will be
much more extensive than what we are likely to get from nomadic bands who
roam in large numbers and cannot be followed up. The same state of things
existed on the Atlantic, and of portions of the country we have still quite ric
historical material. |

You will see that the above will contemplate, in fact, an ethnological atlas, and
that its préparation will be a matter of much time and labor, and occupy the
attention of all those interested in the study. As regards expense, that need
not be great at any one time, for the sub-maps, like the general one, might, in
the first place, be prepared in skeleton, and distributed like the circulars to in-
vite inquiry and contribution of material. As the work progresses, the topog-
raphy may be filled in, for these maps will afford room to exhibit it in much
greater detail than the larger one.

In fact, as regards a eeneral map, even upon the scale proposed, and for pur-
poses of topography itself, I doubt the propriety of going greatly into details.
‘The best general European maps avoid this. he map of the Pacific railroad
explorations, prepared under Mr. Davis’s instructions, is almost useless from its
very minuteness. All the principal features are lost in the details of topography.
But, above all things, it appears to me that multiplicity of object should be
avoided. Of course, a map showing the amount of rain per annum should ex-
hibit the causes of variation in different districts, but this depends on great
features and not on minute ones; and until it is shown that magnetics, for in-
stance, influence the amount of precipitation, it would be improper to introduce
lines of equal variation on a map intended to show those of equal rain fall. So
with a general topographical or ethnological map.

i am engaged, with the assistance of the others, in drawing up the details
which we think it would be well to include in the sub-maps, indicating the bound-
aries and scales, which I will forward, as scon as completed, for your considera-
tion. Of course, I do not know how far you may be inclined to extend this
subject, but the inquiry will at any rate be the means of ascertaining some
valuable facts as to the amount of information at hand.

This leads me to another subject. I find the field which I at first proposed
to mysclf has increased to such formidable proportions that, on consultation
with Mr. Bartlett and others, I have concluded to propose the following
scheme in its place: Professor Henry to request Messrs. Bartlett, Shea, Squier,
Buckingham Smith, and such others as he may think fit, to unite with the
writer in a comprehensive work upon the ethnology and philology of North
America, to be published by the Institution, and to prepare materials for maps
showing the location of the Indian tribes at various periods. The work ean
appear in parts, if thought advisable, as cach finishes his portion, Mz. B. R.
Toss would doubtless undertake British North America, (except the immediate
coast,) including the Chepewyan family, the Crees, and Knistencaux, and ee
haps the Esquimaux, and prepare a memoir giving the history of the s subjec
and all that is valuable regarding those tribes. Mr. Shea to take the saan

east of the Mississippi, except Geor gia and Florida, which might be assigned to
Mr. Smith. Shea’s knowledge and material exceed those of eae one, on the
people of this ssh and his critical acumen is remarkable. Mr. Squier would
assume Central America, and Mr. Bartlett, Texas and New Mexico. ‘The writer
to take the northwest coast, Washington Territory, Oregon, and California.
There would remain the country intermediate between the Mississippi and
Rocky mountains and Mexico. Mexico I would suggest should be assigned to
some of the ethnologists of that country, with an invitation to prepare a general
view of the subject as relates to it.

The work should embrace histography, ethnological divisions of families,
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 91

founded on comparative philology, habits, &c., and psychology—in fact, to
have as wide a range as there are reliable materials to work on. As it would
take too long to await its entire completion, it might appear in a series of mono-
graphs, such as you have already published on various subjects, but the field is
too wide for any one man to undertake an exhaustive work, embracing -the
whole.

I should explain that this suggestion comes entirely from myself, and that I
am led to it by consultation with these gentlemen as to their views of the
demands of ethnology in a work of this kind, not that they desired to invite
such a request.

GEORGE GIBBS.

DECEMBER 26, 1882.

I had the honor to receive, in due course, your letter of December 18,
informing me that the questions submitted in mine of December 3 had been:
referred to Professor Whitney, and shall hope to hear from him in reply.

Pursuant to the directions I received in a former letter, | wrote to Dr. Davis,
requesting him to make any suggestions which might occur to him in regard to
the archzologieal cireular; but having received no reply, I presume that he is
absent from the city. I called on Mr. Squier, who promised to send me his
views on the same subject, but have not yet received them. I mention this as
the cause of the delay in communicating the result to you. If I do not hear
from you to the contrary, I will let the circular stand as it is.

In accordance with your desire that I should prepare a list of additional
words to accompany the philological circular, 1 have gone into one at some
length, in concurrence with Mr. Shea. We agree in submitting to you that the
publication of this additional vocabulary be deferred for the present, and appear
hereafter as a sort of supplement, when we shall have rendered it tolerably
perfect. It may be advisable to extend it to some two thousand or twenty-five
hundred words and phrases, some of them generally applicable, others to only
particular parts of the country. The reason for this extension is as follows:

As regards nouns, the almost entire absence of generic terms renders it
necessary that each object should be as specifically designated as possible; for
instance, each particular kind of animal, tree, &c. Mr. Morgan’s circular illus-
trates this point in respect to relationships, which are distinguished by singular
complication and a great variety of names. In the pronouns there are not only
absolute but copulative pronouns, sometimes both personal and possessive, the
copulative being joined to or incorporafed with nouns and adjectives or verbs,
as the case may be. In some languages, at least, there are two and even three
sets of cardinal numbers, one being positive or simple, another personal or
applied to men, and still another to the counting of money. Again, of the
verbs, the degree of detail into which these languages run may be seen from
the fact that while there may be no abstract word for “to wash” or “kill,”
there will be found separate words for to wash the hands, face, and clothes,
and to kill by stabbing, shooting with a bow, gun, &c.

You will therefore perceive that in order to arrive at any degree of precision
it will be necessary to furnish quite a numerous collection of words, and that
reference must be.had in the selection both of these and the phrases to the
idiom of the language and turn of thought of the speaker. ‘lo accomplish this
in a way satisfactory to yourself will require some time, but in the mean while
the present circular will perform its own more limited task.

The scientific names of animals, &c., should, of course, be given; but whether
it will be best to undertake a translation of the whole into other languages is a
question, for there are many words of daily use in Indian life which have no
synonyms in dictionaries, or except in the various patois.
92 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.

DECEMBER 26, 1862.

T owe you an apology for my omission to comply with your request that I
should send you an account of what Iam doing. It is, in brief, this:

I propose to give a connected sevies of vocabularies of all the known Indian
languages west of the Rocky mountains, deriving from them a classification of
the various tribes into families, and upon this basis to, form an ethnological map
of that part of the country. In addition to this, I propose to give a memoir
upon the character, customs, &c., of those tribes with which I have been in
direct communication, more especially as regards their habits of thinking,
mythology, &c., aud to include or append sub-memoirs by other persons upon
particular districts out of my own range, and a résumé of the statistics of popu-
lation at various periods so far as known. Of course the various authorities
will be referred to, so as to give the bibliography, history, &c., of each section.

I have limited the above mentioned to the country west of the Rocky mount-
ains, because I am satisfied that it is all that I can accomplish within a reason-
able time, and that the labors of several investigators are required for an
exhaustive discussion of what. has already been collected in various parts of the
continent. In a former letter I took the liberty of suggesting the allotment of
other parts of this work to several gentlemen who have pursued separate exam-
nations; such as Mr. Squier for Central America; Mr. Bartlett for Texas, New
Mexico, and Arizona; Mr. Shea for the Atlantic section, except Georgia and
Florida, which should fall to Mr. Buckingham Smith; and Mr. B. R. Ross, of the
Hudson’s Bay Company, for British America, except the northwest coast, which
would come within my own field. Mr. Smith suggests El Exmo. Seftor Don
Fernando Ramirez, of Mexico, as the proper man to give the Mexican part, and
thinks that he would willingly undertake it. It appears to me that the calling
in assistance from Canadian and Mexican sources would not only add value to
the contributions, but be a matter of policy as regards the Institution itself,
making it a North American centre, instead of one confined to the United
States alone. I need not say that the value of the ethnological series which
you may publish will be greatly enhanced by the fact that each contribution is
a specialty. It would, moreover, give the opportunity to make each paper
exhaustive within its own region; Sefior Ramirez, for example, giving the
literary history of the Mexican tribes, as well as their philology and ethnology.

Mr. Ross’s vocabularies, together with Mr. Kennicott’s, are of-the utmost
importance in furnishing materials for comparison between the northern Che-
pewyan languages and the southern b®mches, which extend into New Mexico
and Chihuahua. His notes are carefully prepared and well written. If you
deem it desirable, I will forward them for your examination.

GEORGE GIBBS.

JANUARY 20, 1863...

T herewith enclose a memorandum of what is doing in the way of ethnology,
so far as I am informed.

Mr. Shea has two more numbers of his series out, copies of which will imme-
diately be sent you. One of them is the vocabulary of the San Antonio mission
Indians, the one which Mr. Taylor denominates ‘‘Sextapay,” bus the correctness
of which title is questionable. Mr. Shea has edited this with great care, re-
arranging the whole, as the manuscript was in a confused state. I beg to refer
you to his preface, as also to the appeal at the end of the work. The other is
Mr. Smith’s Nevome. ; ;

The Sextapay, or San Antonio, is one of the numbers due on your contribu-
tion for 1861. Its publication has been delayed by the labor incident to putting
it in presentable form, and by the necessity of casting some special type. This,

PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 93

together with the Mutsun and Yakama grammars, fills the programme for that

ear.
* On your subseription fen 1862 (on which no payment has yet been made)
Smith’s Nevome is the first. The vocabulary of the Mutsun is now going
through the press, and will be immediately followed by a number containing
three “of my larger vocabularies, the Chinook proper, the Clallam, and the
Lummi, the last fee being languages of the Selish family

Shea proposes to follow up for 1863 with the Mohawk radicals, a valuable
Jesuit manuscript, a Jesuit grammar of the Micmac, and my dictionary of the
Nisqually. 1 trust sincerely you will find it-convenient to continue your aid,
for I am not alone in considering this the most valuable series of philological
publications now going on. My. Moore, the librarian of the New York His-
torical Socicty, recently told me that neither England nor France could show
anything to equal it.

The Chinook jargon is now finally in hand, and I trust to send you the
proofs of the first signatures this week, as also of the circulars.

GEORGE GIBBS.

JANUARY 21, 1863.

Mr. Buckingham Smith called upon me to-day and showed me a letter from
Don José Fernando Ramirez, of Mexico, from which [ enclose an abstract:
“There exist no vocabularies of the languages, nor have the grammars ever
been preserved, written by the early missionaries. It is almost impossible to
_ bring together those that have been printed. On this subject a work has been
commenced, entitled ‘Cuadro deseriptivo y comparativo de las lenguas indigenas
de Mexico,’ compendium descriptive and comparative of the native tong es of
Mexico, by Don Francisco Pimentel. The first volume only has been printed,
which comprehends the analysis of twelve languages. Unfortunately, material
is wanting. hose contained in the first volume are the Huaxteco, Mixteco,
Mame, Othomi, Mexican, Zapateco, Tarahumar, Tarasco, Totonaco, Opata or
Teguema, Cahita, and Matlaznica. If you have succeeded in publishing the
grammars of which you informed me, (Pima and Sleve,) and they should arrive
in time, they will be examined in the work. I have not and am unacquainted
with the ‘Archeology of the United. States, by Samuel F. Haven,’ about which
you write me. Of the Smithsonian Contributions I have only the sceond, third,
-and fourth volumes, unless the first volume should be ‘Ancient Monuments of the
Mississippi Valley,’ which I possess. At present there is no way of sending
books to Mexico, unless the Department of State will take charge of them.”
Mr. Smith has handed me the above with the view that I might ask of you to
send to Setior Ramirez such other. papers of the “Contributions” as belong to
archeology. That gentleman is well known as one of the most distinguished
scholars in that department in Mexico, and one whom it would be’ desirable for
the Institution to number among its correspondents. I am, however, astonished
at the account he gives of the paucity of works on the indigenous languages of
that country, so entirely opposite to our general belief here. Under any circum-
stances, Pimentel’s work should be procured if possible.

New Yorn, November 1, 1862.
Dear Sir: The Indian works now printing and to be completed before the
close of the year, beside the Sextapay or San Antonio vocabulary, are:
I. The Mutsun vocabulary of Padre Felipe Arroyo de la Cuesta. This is a
94 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.

collection of phrases, but seems to include all the known words of the language,
and, with the grammar already printed, will furnish all necessary means of com-
paring the language with others. To complete the subject, nothing will be
needed but good comparative vocabularies of the Soledad, and other dialeets.

Il. The Micmac grammar of M. Maillard. Mr. Gallatin drew some ideas
from an extract from fragments of this, but the entire work is necessary as the
best known treatise of the most easterly branch of the Algonquin family.

III. The radical words of the Mohawk language by Rev. James Bruyas.
This work treats the language on the system introduced by the Port Royalists,
of learning the roots or radical words of a language and then deducing the
derivatives. It divides the whole language into conjugations, and gives under
each root the derivatives with many examples.

IV. An alphabetical vocabulary of the Chinook language by Mr. George
Gibbs, in all probability the largest that will ever be made, as the tribe is fast
vanishing, I have also in hand, and may have ready in time, some others, as—

V. Vocabularies of the Klallam and Lummi, by Mr. George Gibbs.

VI. A Névome or Pima grammar, edited by Buckingham Smith, esq.
Next to ¢hese I wish to bring out—

VII. A Nisqually dictionary, by Mr. Gibbs.

Vili. An extremely valuable and ample dictionary of the Illinois language,
_compiled, [-judge, by the Rev. Father Le Boulanger, and for extent, clearness,
and variety, one of the most important labors of the kind known to us.

IX. Huron radical words by Father Carheil, revised by Father Potier, also
a very ample and important work. Nos. 8 and 9 will each form a volume of
500 pages, such as the Onondaga dictionary published by me, and their publi-
cation is an undertaking of such magnitude that it can be carried out only by
the active co-operation of those interested in philological studies.

I thank you for the information as to the forthcoming Cree grammar, which I
will make note of in the Historical Magazine.

Your obedient servant,

JOHN GILMARY SHEA.

Sir: I beg to forward to you the enclosed schedule, which I received about
a fortnight since, and have now filled up according to the request of L. H.
Morgan, esq. I have had some little difficulty in ascertaining the precise word
for some of the relatiouships noted down, but I trast that the results of my
investigations will be as free from error as.can well be expected, and that the
paper as now returned will meet the wishes of the gentleman who sent it to me.
‘The postal arrangements of this country are in, so primitive a state that I fear
some months will elapse ere this letter and the enclosure reaches you; but it
shall be despatched from here by the first opportunity that may oceur. JI have
been living amongst the Cree Indians for ten years, and have long been so far
acquainted with their language as to be able to preach to my congregations
extempore. For some time past my scraps of spare time have been devoted to
the work of compiling a dictronary of the native tongue, as nothing of the kind
is yet extant, and my own experience in past years has taught me that it is
greatly needed. I have now completed the first part, namely, the English-Cree,
which contains very nearly 6,000 English words, with their corresponding
Indian terms, and numerous idiomatic expressions; but I have still sufficient
to occupy my disposable hours for many months in order to complete all that
I contemplate. A friend had advised me to apply to yourself respecting the
publication of the work when finished, and it was my intention to do so; but as
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 95

the failing health of Mrs. Watkins has compelled me to seek permission to visit
England next summer, I have declined doing so, as probably the Church Mis-
’ sionary Society, with which I am connected, may undertake to carry the work
through the press while I am in my native land, and have the opportunity of
correcting any typographical errors which may be made in the proof-sheets.
Still you will perhaps allow me to ask if the Smithsonian Institution is in the
habit of publishing such books as dictionaries of the native languages, and upon
what terms it undertakes to have them printed, as I have no means of ascer-
taining this point. If you have any circular or pamphlet at hand explanatory
of the principles and aims of the institution with which you are officially con-
nected, I should feel much obliged by your kindly forwarding one to me.
Believe me, sir, yours, very obediently,
E. A. WATKINS.
Professor Henry.

The writer of this letter was informed that the Institution does publish works
of the kind mentioned, if approved by a commission of examination, provided
that no other means exists of bringing them before the public.

Deer Creex, NEBRASKA TERRITORY,
September 19, 1862.

Honorep Sir: As I am unable to express myself in English as well as is
necessary and as I wished, I take the liberty of sending a German letter, and
beg for a kind excuse and acceptance of the same.

When I arrived here two years ago, unfortunately, immediately after the
disappearance of the missionary Brunninger, | found some publications of the
Smithsonian Institution relating to various observations. . 1 regret that I wa:
neither in a position to read them cursorily through, nor had I time to even
grasp their contents. When, however, time and other business did permit, 1
looked into them carefully and found great pleasure in so doing, for which reason
I also recognize it as my duty as far as I am able with my feeble powers to
show my gratitude. Only I must also add with much regret that understanding
and apparatus are wanting to me in many branches. Because, however, | stand
here so ignorant, I considered it to be well and necessary first to ask whether
or with what subjects I could render to your honored institution my feeble
services. One point which I in the first place considered as appropriate is the
language of the Shyenne Indians. I have now passed a year with them in a
capacity which is well known to you, and for a quarter of a year I have travelled
about with them for the purpose of learning the language, but have still learned
comparatively little. I permit myself, however, to contribute to your honored
institution a small extract from the treasure which I have learned and collecteg
for their kind consideration. Should it be acceptable to your honored institu-
tion, I will, if you desire, send more. In the mean time I remain, honored sir,
with the highest esteem, your obedient,

My Dear Sir: I amin receipt of your favors, dated April 14 and 21, en-
closing an order from Professor Bache for tidal apparatus, which | forward to
96 PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS.

San Francisco by this. mail. I am in hopes to receive it, for I am not aware

that any observations have ever been made, at a position similar to that of a.

islands, a long distance from a coast line.

I have also received the reports of the Smithsonian Institution for the years
1854-60, check lists of American shells, and catalogue of publications of socie-
ties, for which I beg to return my sincere thanks.

I forward you, per this mail, a catalogue of the works in my library relating
to the Sandwich Islands, which I believe to be near, if not quite, complete.
You will notice in it three periodicals, formerly published at our islands, not in
your catalogue. They contain a few scientific articles. Please look over the
catalogue, and any works published here which you may wish to obtain, please
inform me, and if possible, they will be sent you.

Your wishes in regard to a series of shells described by me shall be attended
to. I also shall furnish you, as soon as I can obtain it, a specimen of the bat
living on our islands, (the only indigenous mammal here,) for the reason that
I received a letter by last mail from Dr. Gray, of the British Museum, acknowl-
edging the receipt of one from me, which he decides, after a hasty examination,
to be identical with a species common to the east and northerly part of America,
usually called the “New York Bat.’ He was to exhibit it at the meeting of
the Zoological Society the evening of the day he wrote me. If he is correct, it
will be a singular exception to the laws of animal distribution.

I am about to commence the publication of a serial work in England, on the
Natural History of the Pacifie Islands, which will be furnished you from there.

My illustrated catalogue of the shells of the Sandwich Islands and their
animals must be deferred for a time, as my collector on the islands south of the
equator, who has been occupied near three years in searching them, informs me
that he has been very successful, having obtained 600 new land and marine
species, and discovered facts of great value to me in regard to distribution of
specics, &c.

1 notice in your report of 1860 an annotncement of the intended publication

of several pamphlets on shells, three by Mr. Carpenter. The one on west coast
species and one on United States expedition shells I particularly wish to see, as

the latter I shall be able to correct. All pamphlets, however, on shells will be.

of use to me.

I beg strongly that duplicates of shells from the Indo-Pacific provinee may
be sent me by the Institution; full value will be returned. Are there none left
of -Wilkes’s e2 xpedition, or of Rodgers’s Japan expedition ?

All packages in future, please address to me and forward to Wells, Fargo &
Co., New. York.

Do not fail to make use of me in any way you may consider of value to the
Institution.

Yours, most truly,

d W. H. PEASE.
Professor JosepH Henry.

The books and specimens referred to in this letter have been received at the
Institution. The species of bat so remarkable, as being the only native mammal
found on the Sandwich Islands, has sinee been identified by Dr. Gray, of the
British Museum, as the Lasiurus Gray?, belonging to the coast of Chile.

some institution of learning, and wanting an owner. It consists of about a dozen
thick folio volumes of plants belonging principally to West Tennessee, very neatly
arranged. ‘They were gathered together by a friend of mine, and as the soldiers
were destroying them, J have taken charge of them, with a view of presenting them
to some scientific institution. Please inform me if it would be worth while to
send them to the Smithsonian Institution, and let me know whether I shall for-
ward them by Adams’s Express, so that they will go safely, and whether I must
pay the charges, &c.
Respectfully, &c.,

P. S.—I have them in a box about 3 feet by 24.

The collection of plants above referred to has been received, and will be
carefully preserved separately until the close of the war. No information has
been obtained as to the original owner or collector.

Leipzic, May 31, 1861.

My Dear Sir: In sending back, through Dr. Fliigel, agent of the Smith-
sonian Institution, the ferns which have been communicated to me by Dr.
Eaton, in your name, I cannot omit to express my warmest thanks, not only for
the kindness shown me in this instance, but also for the collection of ferns des-
tined for the herbary of the university.

I am under a great obligation to the Institution for having given me an oppor-
tunity of examining these ferns, whereby it has materially assisted me in my
studies.

Accept the assurance of my deepest gratitude and the highest esteem.

Yours,
G. METTENIUS, Professor.
Professor Dr. Henry,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Inslitution.

The ferns sent back are the uniques of Brackenridge’s collection, and will
be placed with the rest of the collection now in Dr. 'Torrey’s hands.

GENEVA, Switzerland, May 25, 1862.

Dear Sir; Your letter of the 28th of February was duly received, and that
it has not been sooner answered must be ascribed to the throng of pressing oc-
cupations in which | have been absolutely absorbed. I am under great obliga-
tions for the interest which you have been pleased to take in procuring for me
the books and duplicata of your mammiters which I had requested.

In regard to the catalogue of the Hymenoptera, I regret to say that I have
not reached it, having been engrossed by various other labors. I have com-
menced a large work on America, of which I have had the satisfaction of send-
ing to the Smithsonian Institution the two first parts, the Crustacea and the
Myriapodes. Since then I have been engaged with the Orthoptera, and have
proposed next to proceed with the Hymenoptera. The plates of the Orthoptera
will be forthwith sent to the engraver, but [ have been dreadfully retarded by
a succession of mishaps. My original draughtsman died; another whom I had

trained quitted this service to engage in that of the railroads; a third found a
lucrative place and left me to shift for myself, and the fourth threatens to do the
same thing. Nevertheless, I hope to get through some day or other.

My taxidermist, whom I had left in Mexico to complete my collections, after
having done nothing but cajole me for several years, has ended by leaving the
country without sending me anything of consequence. All this has greatly
hindered me. Still, my descriptive treatise on the Vespide of America is ready,
but I wish to revise the manuscript and correct it from beginning to end, for it
is my custom to leave my manuscripts in the drawer for one or two years and
then remodel them by means of the materials I have in hand. It is only in
this way that zoological works can be worthily composed. If you are urgent,
however, I will leave the Orthoptera in order to take up the Wasps and will
send you the manuscript this winter. Please indicate to me your wishes on this
subject.

As to the other families, I cannot undertake them till I have done with the
Orthoptera and the Wasps. But as you seem in haste, I think your best course
would be to intrust this work to some American whose special line of study
lies in that direction, and Mr. Edward Norton is well qualified for it. With the
same view I have already prevailed on him to take in hand the Ichneumonide.

It would be impossible to make purely and simply a catalogue of the Hyme-
noptera. The number of known species is much too restricted. There would
be needed a descriptive work, and you could not acquit yourself of it under
less than ten large volumes. The labor upon the Hymenoptera is a colossal
one. When I shall have published the Wasps, I will see whether I can under-
take another family for you, and believe that 1 can; but, trust me, you must
proceed by families or you will have nothing satisfactory.

I take this opportunity of informing you that in July I shall forward to you
a package containing three memoirs of mine and my map of Mexico; and in
addition, certain books for several learned Americans. Have you Saussure’s
Treatise on Hygrometry? Be so kind as to have the books distributed accord-
to the address of each.

Please accept, dear sir, my cordial good wishes and the expression of my entire
esteem.

D. H’Y DE SAUSSURE..

P. S—If you have still any Vespide to send me to complete my manuscript,
it will be necessary to do so soon, that I may be enabled to employ them as
matcrials. My manuscript will form a volume in 8vo.

You will inexpressibly oblige me if you will have the recent American work
on Tehuantepec sent to me.

We have since learned that the manuscript work on the Vespide or Wasps
of America, mentioned in the foregoing letter, has been completed. It will be
published as soon as practicable after it has been received and translated from
the French

New York, September 16, 1862.

Dear Sir: My brother wishes me to address you in regard to a cabinct of
minerals which he would like to selZ to the Smithsonian Institution. He has a
collection of minerals, mostly Californian and Mexican, between 2,000 and
3,000 in number, and containing about $1,500 in gold and silver. His reason
for selling is, that it is entirely too valuable to retain in his office, as he is afraid
of being robbed. He asks $3,000 for it, and refers to Professor Whitney, of
California, for an examination.

You would confer a favor by returning an answer to this note when conve-
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 99

nient; and perhaps, if the Smithsonian Institution does not want the collection,
you may be cognizant of some other institution which might desire to obtain it.
Very respectfully, yours, &c.,
Professor HENRY.

The foregoing is one of many propositions to sell specimens of natural his-
tory, &c., to all of which the answer has been made that the Institution does
not purchase articles of the kind.

The following letter was received from M. Romero, Mexican minister, in
reply to a request made to him to furnish a letter to facilitate the explorations
of Mr. Xantus, in Mexico:

WASHINGTON, December 4, 1862.

Dear Sir: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of
the Ist instant, informing me of the object ne the appointment of Mr. John
Xantus as United Siates consul at J Mean and asking me to furnish him
with such letter of troduction for the governors of the States of Colima, Mi-
choacan, and the adjacent ones, as may help him in the prosecution of the scien-
tific investigations he intends to make in a portion of western Mexico whose
natural productions are very little known.

Being desirous to contribute to the success of Mr. Xantus’s scientific researches
and labors, I enclose you herewith letters of introduction for the governors of
the States of Michoacan, Jalisco, Colima, and Sinaloa, which I hope will fully
answer his purpose. Should he desire letters for any other governor, I will
furnish him with them as soon as you let me know it.

As regards the entrance of the scientific apparatus Mr. Xantus may take
with him to be used in making collections in natural history for the museum in
charge of your Institution, | am happy to say that I think he will not have
any difficulty with the customs authorities at Manzanillo, such articles being free
from duty according to the Mexican tariff.

HON, JAMES A. PEARCE, OF MARYLAND,

ONE OF THE REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

BY

Pror. A. D. BACHE, LL. D., Superintendent of the U. S. Coast Survey.

Ata meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, held
January 31, 1863, Professor Henry, the Secretary, announced the death of
Hon. James A. Pearce, one of the Regents.

Prof. Bache, after appropriate remarks, offered the following resolutions, which
were unanimously adopted :

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution deeply mourn the loss
of their distinguished fellow-regent, JAMES ALI RED PEARCE.

Resolved, That in the death of Mr. Pearce our country has lost a refined and influential
citizen, the Senate of the United States an able, judicious, honest statesman, and this institu-
tion an active, intelligent, and learned Regent.

Resolved, That we sincerely condole with the afflicted family of Mr. Pearce, and offer to
them our heartfelt sympathy in their great bereavement.

Resolved, That a copy of these resolutions be communicated by the Secretary of the Smith-

sonian Institution to the family of the deceased.

On motion of Mr. TrumMBULL, it was—

Resolved, That Professor Bache be requested to furnish a copy of his remarks in relation
to Hon. James A. Pearce, for insertion in the journal of the Board of Regents.

HU OrG

Again has death invaded our circle, and taken from our councils and our
active sympathies one of the most admirably gifted intellects which has at any
time been called upon to shape the destiny or direct the labors of the Smith-
sonian Institution. A member of the executive committee from nearly the sce-
ond year of the organization under the act of Congress of 1846, attentive to
every detail, whether scientific, administrative, or financial, Mr: Pearce was
always prompt at the call of every duty. His entire and cordial acquiescence
in the form of organization adopted for the Institution, his liberal and zealous
co-operation with the Board of Regents, his earnest support of, and unfaltering
EULOGY. 101

confidence in, the discretion and integrity of its Secretary, were as conspicuous
as they were productive of the most lasting and important benefits. And though
it is true that the general form and policy of the Institution were determined
under the authority of Congress, by its first Board of Regents, yet it is quite as
certain that strenuous action was afterwards needed to maintain it in its adopted
* course, and secure it from projected innovations which, though strenuously
advocated at the time, few now regard with aught but disfavor. To this end no
one lent more effectual aid than our lamented colleague. Although, from taste
and the conditions of his active life, he might more properly be styled a literary
man, yet were his scientific attainments by no means inconsiderable, and a liberal
and cultivated mind, which admitted of no narrow views, enabled him to em-
brace, in all its comprehensive simplicity, the idea of the generous foreigner
who, in founding this Institution, consecrated his fortune to ‘the increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men.”

In whatever Mr. Pearce engaged he exhibited the same spirit. Marked as a
leader from his boyhood, at school as at coliege, in his profession as in the
councils of the nation, in his neighborhood, hi: State, his country, as well as in
the church to which he had dedicated his faith, he stood distinguished for an
enlightened estimate and an efficient support of whatever is elevated and caleu-
lated to elevate. To him the work of construction was ever far more congenial
than that of demolition; to improve and preserve was an instinct, to confound
and destroy, an innate aversion of, his nature. Refined in his tastes, brilliant in
society, instructive from the affluence of his ideas and extent of information,
without ostentation as without pretension, social, genial, even playful among his
intimates—such was the associate whom we must long mourn, feeling that at
the council board as in the familiar and friendly circle, we have lost one who
strengthened us in our adhesion to what is right, good, or true, while ever prompt
to lead us wherever progress held out rational hopes of improvement.

Generally, men of the temperament we have described are impatient of details;
but this was not at all so with our departed friend. It afforded him pleasure to
systematize and reduce to order even the dry details of finance, and a wonderful
memory and a quick perception enabled him to pass them in rapid review with
a scrutiny of every particular. His mental vision was as minute as compre-
hensive, and his analytical faculty never dismissed a subject of investigation
until he was thoroughly satisfied with the arrangement, the method, the results :
in a word, he was content with little less than the perfection of whatever occu-

ied his attention or claimed his solicitde.

The objects which in Congress occupied most of his attention, and which it
gave him most pleasure to defend and sustain, were those connected with litera-
ture and science, and in these he showed the same qualities which as chairman
of our executive committce he has here so often exhibited. With the great
interests of state and the high objects of national politics he was abundantly quali-
fied to grapple; in fact, he shrunk from no occasion in which to exert himself when
enlarged views and skilful powers of debate could be rendered serviceable to his
country or the world. But if duty called upon him from time to time for such
efforts, still it was to objects promotive of art and science and high civilization,
to means for man’s moral and intellectual improvement, and for the enlargement
of his knowledge and power over nature, that he turned with ever new and un-
wearied interest. ‘To him probably more than to any other senator the library
of Congress was indebted for the augmented fund which it has now for some
years enjoyed, and for the care taken in the selection of the materials which
render its shelves so useful. The exploring expedition was more than once
indebted to his earnest and persistent efforts for the continuance of the means
of publication of its results; the Coast Survey for expositions of its importance
to the country and the world; the Smithsonian for warding oif assaults, and
reconciling enthusiastic but misguided opposition ; the naval and military expe-
102 EULOGY.

ditions, boundary surveys, and explorations, for close, searching investigations,
which led to important improvements and to cordial support. ‘The great work
of the extension of the Capitol found in him a wise advocate and judicious friend.
Not afraid of what was new, he yet aimed at nothing for the sake of novelty.
In connexion with the decoration of our public buildings, our sculptors and
painters found in him a most enlightened appreciator of their works, and one
always ready to promote the great cause of their art by legitimate means.

He had a remarkable power of attaching to himself men of science, literature,
and art, and, in return, found in them some of his most intimate and highly-
prized companionships. His friendships were warin, and once formed, were
proof against all trials of absence or change of fortune. Many of his ardent
attachments reverted to the friends and associates of his parents, and to family
relations of even an older date, acquiring in his breast a sacred title by the
claims of the past.

The genial elements of his character naturally expanded most freely in the
circle of his family and friends, where he was truly and ever at home. His
garden, its fruits and flowers, were his habitual delight; his farm and its opera-
tions seemed to touch by association the springs of his deepest affections. He
superintended every process with a judgment rarely at fault, and watched all
the varied developments of nature with the interest of the amateur or the natur-
alist. Whoever had not seen Mr. Pearce in his dwelling, in his garden, or upon
his farms, knew him but imperfectly.

JAMES ALFRED Pearce, the colleague, the counsellor, the friend, to whom
we must now bid a final adieu, was born in the town of Alexandria, then part
of the District of Columbia, December 14, 1805. His parents, who were’ of
Scottish descent, and citizens of Maryland, dying during his childhood, the care
of his education devolved upon his maternal grandfather, the late Dr. Dick, of
Alexandria, an eminent physician of that day, who will be remembered by the
student of American history as having been one of the medical attendants who
ministered at the dying bed of Washington. So rapid yet thorough was the
progress of the young student in the rudimentary stages of education, that he
graduated at Princeton College at the boyish age of seventeen, bearing away
from competitors of no ordinary ability, and much subsequent distinction, the
highest lonors of his class. Having adopted the law as his profession, and
permanently settled at Chestertown, Maryland, the former residence of his
parents, he soon reecived the earnest of future success in the confidence, affee-
tion, and support of the community—a community to whose favor he might,
indeed, already look forward in virtue of the memory of a meritorious and dis-
tinguished ancestry. His first step upon the more public stage which was
thenceforth to be the scene of his labors and success was his unsolicited election
to the legislature of Maryland, in 1831. From that day, with a single inter-
val of two years, his talents and time were devoted to the service of his fellow-
citizens in the halls of legislation, his career having led-him, by a progression
founded on the uncanvassed but ever-increasing confidence and respect of the
people, through the House of Representatives to the Senate chamber, in which
be was fulfillmg the unexpired term of a third election at the period of his
death.

His characteristic qualities and tendencies as a legislator have been already
slightly touched upon in this memorial, but whoever recalls the momentous
events. the gigantic and often acrimonious struggles for ascendency, the por-
tentous and brilliant debates which, from 1835 to 1861, fixed the public at-
tention, and excited the alternate hopes and fears of contending parties ;
whoever pictures to himself the majestic forms which then occupied the legis-
lative arena, will remember that, through all these events, and measuring him-
self in no unequal competition with the foremost men of that earnest time,
our colleague continued to advance steadily in public appreciation, to fill a yet
EULOGY. 103

wider and wider space in the eyes of the country, that on him rests no imputa-
tion of having ever purchased favor or advancement by a sacrifice of the slightest
principle, or of having once deviated into any of those equivocal positions which
sometimes bring disrepute on illustrious names ; whoever shall recall and consider
these things will undoubtedly be qualified to form a more adequate and vivid
conception of his labors and his worth than could be derived from any por-
traiture which this occasion would permit, or perhaps even the most labored
eulogy could supply.

Nor were striking testimonials wanting to his peculiar and conspicuous merits :
it rested but with himself to have occupied positions of the highest publie dis-
tinction. A place in the cabinet and a seat in the federal judiciary were suc-
cessively offered him; on more than one occasion his name was publicly can-
vassed in connexion with the presidency of the United States. ‘The former,
however, he declined ; the latter he steadily diseountenanced. He seems to have
felt that the Senate chamber was the proper sphere for his peculiar tastes and
powers—a sphere equal to his well-regulated ambition, not below his admitted
merit. ‘The patronage incident to the executive branch of government involves
much that would have been repugnant to his feelings; the judiciary has objections
peculiar to itself in the ever-recurrent and monotonous, nature of its functions ;
the representative department of Congress was for him too much influenced by
the fluctuations of popular opinion. ‘The Senate, in the stability of its tenure,
and the vivacity and variety of its discussions, in its character of a consultative
and executive as well as legislative body, in the dignity and importance of its
deliberations, involving the interests of States and the relations of national inter-
course, seemed exactly fitted to give scope to his abilities, and to satisfy every
aspiration he might indulge for usefulness or consideration. Perhaps it was in
the committee-room that his influence made itself more particularly felt, for here
the extent of his information, the weight of his character, the directness and
integrity of his purpose, his patience for details, his familiarity with the forms
of business, and aptitude in applying them with logical acuteness to the disen-
tanglement of questions of fact and law, his co-operative spirit, his genial and
companionable nature and manner, all conspired to give authority to his decisions,
and to conciliate reliance and acquiescence on the part of those with whom he
acted.

Had Mr. Pearce not embraced the profession of law, he would doubtless, under
suitable circumstances, have been celebrated as an agriculturist. Had he not
resigned himself to political life, he could not have failed of eminence in science
or in literature. It is indeed rare to meet with one whose capabilities and excel-
lencies were so varied and so distinct, nor is it possible that, knowing him as I
have done, I should speak of him otherwise than frankly and from the heart,
though conscious of the imperfect representation which I have been able to give
of a man s0 intrinsically great in all the elements which constitute true greatness,
so entirely beloved for all that refers itself to the amenities of social intercourse
and the sacred endearments of home.

Tn conclusion, it is proper to add that the peculiarities which marked his char-
acter during the active years of his life exhibited themselves in the closing period
of his career under a new but harmonious aspect. Afflicted with an incurable
malady, he contemplated his approaching end and endured his intense suffer-
ing with the unwavering faith and resigned patience of a Christian. The reli-
gious principles which he had imbibed in childhood, and which had perhaps im-
perceptibly formed the basis of his character, became the dominant objects of his
thoughts, and the consolation and happiness of his last hours.

PART I.
INTE OD UCT OR XN:
OUTLINE OF OPTICAL DISCOVERY.

The knowledge which we possess of the material objects surrounding us in
the universe is principally received through the sense of vision. I'rom the
other senses we derive a much more limited range of impressions. 'The touch
furnishes us with a valuable means of confirming or correcting the information
we receive from sight; but its usefulness extends only to objects in our own
immediate vicinity. The hearing, though t hrough it, by the aid of spoken lan-
guage, we are supplied with a vast muiiarde of ideas which have had their
origin in impressions previously made upon other senses, contributes of itself,
in any other form, but very slightly to the great stock of our knowledge.

Such therefore being the pre-eminence of vision among the senses, light,
which is its medium, is, and has ever been, the most important of phy sical
instrumentalities in promoting the intellectual development of the human race,
and making progress a possibility. But, while occupying this peculiar relation
to the history of our advancement in the knowledge of nature, while so fertile
in the revelations it has unfolded to us of the properties and qualities of other
things, it is remarkable that light has itself furnished, in its own nature, one of
the most difficult and perplexing of all the subjects of physical inquiry; so
that, even down to an advanced period of the present century, the world of
science may be said to have been upon no other subject more widely at vari-
ance than upon the elementary and fundamental question, What is light?

Nor is it possible to explain this want of harmony by supposing the inquiry
to have but recently originated. Since, in the physical world, light has
been the ever present and ever most efficient handmaid of the human un-
derstanding, its phenomena must, to some extent at least, have attracted the
attention of the first intelligent inhabitants of our planet. The first man who
breathed could not have failed to notice the images of visible objects, formed
by reflection in the bosom of every quiet pool; and the first rude navigator

who endeavored to float himself from shore to shore, across waters too deep to
be traversed by ordinary and simpler expedients, must have been struck by the
singular distortion of his paddle at the line where it entered the water. The
natural alternations of light and darkness, their coincidence with the rising and
setting of the sun, the appearance and disappearance of the stars, the changes
of the moon, the rainbow in the clouds, the differences between different bodies
as luminous and non-luminous, transparent and opaque, and finally the very
fact of vision itself—all these phenomena constantly, from the earliest times,
presenting themselves without being sought, must have excited the curiosity of
men and invited investigation, centuries before the systematic study of nature,
in any of her varied departments, had had a beginning.

But the difficulties which perplex the inquiry m: inifest themselves in the im-
pertection of the speculations which have come down to us from the earliest
philosophers regarding the subject, and in the extremely slow progress of dis-
covery which marks much of the later history of this interesting branch of
science. A notion was for a very long time prevalent among the ancients that
vision is effected by means of rays procee ding from the eye to the object. This
idea is not found in Aristotle; but it was introduced into the schoo. of Plato,
and continued to be received for many centuries. The persistency of the doc-
trine is remarkable, inasmuch as the light which is self-evidently indispensable
to vision, proceeds from sources foreign to the observer.

The elementary phenomena of reflection and refraction suggest a natural
division of the science of optics into two branches; and this distinction is made
by the earliest systematic writer on the subject whose works have descended
to us. This was Euclid—supposed to have been the geometrician of that
name—who lived about 300 years before our era. The general laws which
govern the reflection of light, being comparatively easy of detection, were stated
by him with tolerable correctness; but what he has written on refraction is of
little value.

Ptolemy, the astronomer of Alexandria, who was born about the year 70 of

our era, attempted to discover the law of refraction by experiment. “His appa-
ratus was ingenious, and was not different in principle from that which has been
employed by Silbermann, Soleil, and oihers, in our own time, for the same pur-
pose. He measured the angles of refraction corresponding to various angles of
incidence, between 0° and 90°, for both water and glass, and left his measure-
ments recorded in his System of Optics. In order that we may judge of the
degree of accuracy attained by him it is necessary to anticipate what is to follow,
so far as to define, in this place, a few technical expressions. By the angle of
incidence made by light falling upon a reflecting or refracting Aare is
meant the angle between the ray and the perpendicular to the surface. By the
angle of refraction is meant the angle between the ray which has passed
through the surface and the same perpendicular on the other side. By the
angle of reflection is meant, in like manner, the angle between the reflected
ray and the perpendicular. By the plane of incidence, the plane of refraction,
or the plane of reflection is meant the plane which contains the incident ray
and the perpendicular, the refracted ray and the perpendicular, or the reflected
ray and the perpendicular. All these planes are coincident, except in cases
where double refraction takes place, when one of the planes of refraction is not
usually coincident with the corresponding plane of incidence.

As a measure of the amount of deviation or change of direction produced in
a ray by refraction, the sme of any given angle of incidence is divided by the
sine of the corres sponding angle of refraction, which latter is determined by ob-
servation. The quotient is constant for the same substance, no matter what be
the angle of incidence taken. It is called the cxdex of refraction. The con-
stancy ‘of this quotient was not known to Ptolemy. The discovery of its con-
SNELLIUS —LAW OF REFRACTION. 109

stancy, at a comparatively recent period, marks an era in the history of the
science ; and it was, as we shall see, the discovery of the /aw of refraction.

The ascertained index of refraction for water is 1.33582. If we make a com-
putation of its value from the measured angles of Ptolemy, we find a mean of
1.30147. Butif we take his measurements at the incidence of 50°, where the
relative variations of the angles of incidence and refraction are most marked and
most easily measured, we obtain 1.33555, which is exccedingly near the truth.

The true index of refraction for glass is between 1.48 and 1.60, according to
the materials and density. Crown glass varies from below 1.50 to about 1.525.
Ptolemy’s mean determination would be 1.484. But at 50° he approaches
nearer the truth, his angles giving 1.5321.

For rays passing from water to glass, the relative index computed from his
measurements would be 1.1390, the true being 1.14145. ‘The near agreement
of these numbers with modern determinations is remarkable, especially consid-
ering that Ptolemy’s measures are given only to the nearest half degree.

Ptolemy was unable, however, to derive any practical advantage from these
results, since the magnitudes of the angles seemed to be governed by no law
which he could detect. And in this unsatisfactory condition the whole subject
of refraction remained for the fifteen succeeding centuries.

As an astronomer, Ptolemy could hardly fail to notice the effect of atmos-
pheric refraction upon the apparent positions of the heavenly bodies; and he
has the merit of having recognized the fact, which others after him disputed,
that the displacement is always in a vertical plane, and also that it attains its
maximum in the horizon and is zero in the zenith.

About half a century later than Ptolemy flourished Claudius Galen, the cele-
brated Greek physician. Ina treatise on the uses of the members of the human
body he speaks at some length of the phenomena of vision, and lays down the
fundamental law on which the stereoscope has been very recently constructed,
that the picture which we sce of a solid body is made up of two pictures dis-
similar to each other, one seen by each eye separately.

But it was impossible that optical science should make any important pro-
gress so long as the law which determines the path of a ray in passing from one
medium to another remained unknown. We are compelled, therefore, to descend
to the earlier portion of the 17th century before we find a practicable ground on
which to build a systematic science, or lay even a foundation for the splendid
superstructure which the future had in reserve in this department of physical
inquiry. In the year 1626 Willebrord Snellius, professor of mathematics at
Leyden, died at an carly age, leaving behind him manuscripts, among which was
contained a statement of the important law in question under the following form:
If MN be a plane horizontal surface, dividing a denser
medium below it from a rarer one above, and if a point at D
be observed by the eye at A, the apparent place of D will be
at B, vertically above D, in the line AC produced; and what-
ever be the inclination of the ray to the surface, the line CD

Fig. 1. will be to the line CB in a constant ratio. Or, if CD be made
the radius of the circular are FDQ, and DE be drawn perpendicular ‘to the
surface, the radius CI, being the visual ray AC produced, will be divided at B
in a constant ratio. If, at I’, we draw to the circle the tangent FH, producing
CD and CB to mect it at H and G, then CH and CG, which have the same
ratio to each other as CD and CB, will be the secants of the angles HCI
and GCF, or the co-secants of the angles HCQ and GCQ, (—ACP,) formed
by the refracted and incident rays with the perpendicular, PQ, to the refract-
ing surface MN, technically called the angles of refraction and of incidence.
The geometrical law of Snellius, therefore, translated into the language of
trigonometry, is this: That when a ray, passing from one medium to another,
undergoes refraction at the common surface, the ratio of the co-secant of the

110 EFFECTS OF REFRACTION.

angle of incidence to the co-secant of the angle of refraction is constant. As
the co-secants of angles are inversely as the sines of the same angles, the law
may be more conveniently expressed by saying that, in the circumstances sup-
posed, the s¢mes of the angles mentioned are in a constant ratio. It was in this
form that the law was first published by Descartes, eleven years after the death
of Snellius. It is, therefore, frequently referred to as the law of Descartes.

It may be proper to mention that, previously to the discovery of this impor-
tant law by Snellius, it had been remarked by the illustrious Kepler that for
incidences below thirty degrees a ratio almost constant exists between the angles
of incidence and of refraction themselves. _ This is true because for small angles
the increments of the are and of the sine are nearly proportional. But when the
incidence is moderately large, the divergency of the two ratios becomes very
wide,

An examination of the figure given above will show that the refraction of a
plane surface produces no distortion in lines which are at right angles to the
surface, but only diminishes or increases their apparent length according as the
medium in which the object is situated is denser or rarer than that on the side
of the observer. Thus the line ED is reduced to the apparent length EB.
The amount of this reduction increases with the obliquity of the visual ray, for
the ratio of CD to CB, which is constant, is always less (except when the
incidence is perpendicular) than the ratio of ED to EB, and the divergency
of these ratios is always increasing. It follows that the apparent depth of a
fluid is always less than the real depth, and that the illusion.is more striking in
proportion as the point observed is more remote from that immediately beneath
the eye. Thus the horizontal bottom of a cistern or pool of uniform depth
presents a curved appearance like
that here represented. If MN be

N the surface and ICL the horizontal
WwW plane at the bottom of a sheet of
L water, the eye being placed at the

point P above it, this plane will
present a conchoidal appearance
like that of the curve D’E’A”.
The position of the points of the
bottom which, to an eye situated at P, appear in the directions PD, PE, &c,
may be found by asimple geometrical construction. Drawing the perpendicular
PAA’, divide the depth AA’ at the point A’, so that AA’ shall be to AA”
in the ratio of 2 to 1:—n being the index of refraction. Through A’ draw
VW parallel to the surface. Produce PD, PE, &c., until they intersect the
bottom at G and H, and with the radii DE and EH describe the circular ares
GG’ and HH’. Through G” and H” where DG, EH, intersect VW, draw per-
pendiculars to the bottom, intersecting the ares in G’ and H’, Join DG’ and
Ei’. The points D’ and E’, where the joining lines intersect the bottom, are
the points which will be seen from P in the directions PD, PE, and the ap-
yarent positions of those points will be at D” and E”, where the visual rays
PD and PE produced meet perpendiculars drawn from D’, E’, to the surface.
Any number of points being thus found, the curve drawn through them all
will show the appearance of the level bottom M/N‘ as it is seen from a point
above the surface as P. This curve is a conchoid, whose polar equation is

It is apparent from the foregoing that all lines seen through a single plane

or less distorted. A straight rod partly immersed in water, as FD‘, appears
sharply bent at the surface, and slightly curved beneath, assuming the apparent
direction OD”. Moreover, though, as in this case, the real direction should
pass through the eye, so that in a uniform medium, only the extremity could be
visible, the effect of refraction gives a lateral view of all the part immersed.

The next important step in the progress of optical discovery, after the detec-
tion of the general law of refraction, was made by the illustrious Newton, who,
in the year 1672, communicated to the Royal Society the experimental researches
by which he established the compound nature of light, and the unequal refran-
gibility of its component rays. He held that the common white light of the
sun is made up of elementary rays differing at the same time in color and in
refrangibility. The number of tints which he considered sufliciently distinct
to be regarded as independent components is seven. It seems unnecessary,
however, to suppose the existence of: more than three elementary colors, it being
possible, by mingling these in various proportions, to produce all the rest, while
the degrees of refrangibility between the extreme limits vary through an infi-
nite number of infinitely small differences.

Newton’s method of demonstrating the truth of his doctrine was as simple
as it is ingenious. The colors which border the images of objects observed
through prisms of glass or other transparent substances, or through cylindrical
or globular vessels filled with water, had long been familiar. Newton placed
such a prism in the path of a ray of the sun’s light, introduced through a small
aperture into a dark room, and received the refracted image or spectrum upon a
white screen placed at some distance. Before the interposition of the prism
the beam produced upon the screen a white and circular image of the sun itself.
But after the rays had been bent by refraction the image appeared very much
elongated in the direction of the refraction, and brilliantly colored in a series of
tints, passing by insensible gradations from red, through orange, yellow, green,
blue, and indigo to violet. This last color was at the end most refracted. In
turning the prism around an axis parallel to its edges, Newton observed that
the deviation of the spectrum from the original direction of the sun’s rays was
variable, increasing from a certain minimum (experimentally found) by turning
the prism either to the right or to the left. This minimum corresponds to that
particular position of the prism at which the angles of incidence and emergence
are equal. Upon this observation he founded a test experiment in regard to the
refrangibility of the rays of different colors. Making a small circular aperture
in the screen upon which the spectrum was formed, at a point where, by turn-
ing the prism, he could pass the entire spectrum over it, he placed behind the
aperture a second prism, which thus reccived, successively, rays of a single
color only. At a distance behind the second prism a second screen intercepted
the light which passed through it, when it was observed that this second image,
instead of being elongated like the first, remained sensibly circular, while the
positions of the circles of different colors upon the screen were further and
further removed from the original direction of the unretracted rays as the tints
ascended from red to violet. ‘This phenomenon of the separation of the compo-
nent- colors of light by refraction has been called dispersion. Newton was of
opinion that the dispersive powers of all bodies are equal; or, in other words,
proportional to their refractive powers; and that, the mean refractive powers of
two bodies being equal, their refractive powers for each particular color must be
equal also. Both these suppositions, as we shall see, are unfounded.

The discovery of Newton furnished an easy explanation of the interesting
natural phenomenon of the rainbow. ‘This beautiful meteor had been the sub-
ject of many unsatisfactory speculations; and though de Dominis, as early as
1611, had furnished a true theory of the manner of formation of the inner bow,
he had not been able to account for its colors. He showed that there is a certain
incidence at which, if the parallel rays of the sun fall upon the anterior surface
‘

112 THE RAINBOW.

of a transparent globe, they will be reflected from within so as to emerge, still
parallel to each other, at a point on the other side of the centre. The emergent
rays will form a constant angle with the incident rays, and, entering the « eye
of the observer standing with his back to the sun, will form the same angle with
a line supposed to be drawn from the sun through the eye. This line from the
sun through the eye being made an axis, and the above supposed reflected ray
being revolved around it, there will be traced out in the heavens a circle, from
every part of which, if rain-drops are present, there will come an amount of
light above that which is reflected from the surrounding cloud.

This explanation satisfactorily determines the locus of the bow; but it fails
to account for its tints, or the extent of surface over which they are spread. It
would require that the are should be white, and that it should be no broader
than the sun; that is to say, that its breadth should be only about half a degree.
The actual breadth of the inner bow is, however, two degrees and a quarter;
and that of the outer three degrees and three quarters. Newton’s discovery
furnished the necessary supplement to the theory.

In fact, if the circumference PP’/P” be a section
through the centre of a transparent globe, and IP a
ray of the sun falling on it in this plane, it is easy to
see that this ray, or portions of it; will undergo many
reflections within the globe, while portions will succes-
sively emerge at the points in which reflection takes
place. “E here will first be some loss by external reflec-
tion in the direction PR. The portion which enters
the globe will be bent, by refraction, from the original
direction PI to the direction PP’. At P’ a portion
will emerge in the direction PIX, being bent from the
direction PQ as much as PP’ was bent from PK.
The same thing occurs at P’, P’’, and so on. Put ¢ = the angle of incidence
(the angle made by the incident ray with the radius)—the angles of emer-
gence are all of this same value. Put p for the angle of refraction. The figure
shows that add the angles of internal reflection have this value. Let 6 represent
the bending or deviation of the ray by refraction at each incidence or emer-
eence.. a hen O—=t—p. And the amount of deflection of the successive re-
flected rays from the original direction being sige by’ DD De),
aud that of the successiv ely emergent rays s by A, 4’....D(™), we shall have
(an entire circumference being denoted by 2z)

Deflection of PP’—d; deflection of PE—d—20.

Deflection of P’P"—D—d+7—2p; deflection of P’E’—=d4’—=20-+7—2p.

Deflection of P’ P’“—D/—0-+ 2z—4p; deflection of P’’E=4"—=20 + 22—4p.

Deflection preceding mth emergence—D(™)—0+m(z—2p) ; deflection mth
emergence— A(™) 20+ m(z—2p).

If, for 0, we put its value — :—p, we shall have—~

A'—=2:-+-n7—4p. =
A" = 2¢+227—6op.
A(™)==2¢ + mz—2(m-+1)p.

The law of the formation of these eTon essions is obvious. The deflection
of each of the successively emergent rays is increased at each reflection within
the globe by the angular amount z—2p.

Now, as all these values contain the angle ¢, it is obvious that the deflections
caunot be equal when the incidences are uncqual; or, in other words, that the
emergent rays will usually diverge from each other. Moreover, the deflections
do not regularly increase and diminish with the incidence.

' ’ THE RAINBOW. 113

Neither of the last values is intermediate between the two preceding in the
same column. In both cases, therefore, there appears to be some point between
the extreme incidences, where the deflection is a minimum; and it being the
law of maxima and minima that variations in their vicinity are insensible, it
follows that near the incidences corresponding to those values the emergent rays
will be sensibly parallel. But when the general expression—

A(™ )==2:-+- mnz—2'm-+-1)oe
becomes a minimum*, the cosine of the incidence must have the value—
cos ex + / onsen
V (m+1)?—1,
in which » denotes the index of refraction.

This determines, therefore, the incidences at which the deflections are minima;
and hence, those at which the emergent rays are (to use the term employed by
Newton) efficacious. It will be seen that, when the index of refraction is given,
the value of cos: will be affected only by the variable m, which is the number
of internal reflections. If this be made zero, cos: will be infinite; in other
words, when the rays are not reflected at all, they do not emerge efficacious.

By putting m—1 and m—2 we shall obtain values corresponding to the de-
flections which produce what are ealled the inner and outer bows. J'rom these
values we may deduce the apparent diameters of the ares; and the theoretic
results thus obtained are found to accord with actual measurements. By putting
m=3, 4,5, &e., successively, we may obtain the /oct of an infinite number of
additional bows; but after the second reflection, the light ceases to be intense
enough to produce an impression on the eye.

Since, with a very slight alteration of ¢ the rays cease to be efficacious, it is
evident that, if the sun were but a point, and the index x invariable, the bow
would be reduced to a simple line of light. But as every point of the sun will
produce its separate bow, the visible breadth, with » constant, would be that
of the sun itself—that is, about half a degree. Newton’s experiments on dis-
persion, however, showed that the value of the index » sufficiently varies, in
passing from the red to the violet, to alter sensibly the angle of incidence cor-
responding to the efficacious rays of the several colors, and sufficient, accord-
ingly, to alter the amount of deflection which those several rays undergo before
reaching the eye. As the bows appear in the direction of these deflected rays,
it follows that the different colors will not be superposed, and that the breadth
of the compound bow will be greater than the breadth of the sun by the total
amount of their want of conformity. The index for the red may be taken at
1.346; that for the violet at 1.333. Employing these values, we have for the
bow by one reflection:

Violet rays. -t, == 58° 40’. 4’, == 139° 43’. Radius of bow —=40° 17’.

Red rays. - . -t; = 59° 234’. 4', = 137° 584’. Radius of bow = 42° 13’.

* The general expression for the deflection being— oi

And for the bow by two reflections: ‘

Red rays. - -¢ == 71° 26/10". 4”; == 234° 9/20. Radius of bow 54° 9! 20"

From the values of 4 it will be manifest that the rays which produce the
bow by one reflection must enter the rain drops above the ray which passes
through the centre; and that those which produce the bow by two reflections
must enter below the same central ray.

The differences between the values of 4, and 4, above, show the amount by
which the breadths of the bows are increased in consequence of the variability
of x. These amounts are, for the first bow, 1° 44’ 40”, and for the second,
3° 10’ 30’. The colors are produced by the want of conformity of the bows
corresponding to the several elementary rays; and their feebleness is owing to
the fact that, notwithstanding this want of conformity, they do, on account of
the considerable diameter of the sun, very sensibly overlap, while they are
also diluted by the white light reflected from the anterior surface of the drops.
Were they entirely superposed upon each other the bow would be white.

While the discoveries of Newton and Snellius, just mentioned, were: removing
old impediments to progress in optical science, observation continued to add
new ones more perplexing than those which had disappeared. In the year
1665 there was published, at Bologna, a posthumous work by Francis Maria
Grimaldi, an Italian Jesuit, in which were, for the first time, described certain
phenomena now very familiar under the name of diffraction. He stated that
if any very small object be placed in a pencil of divergent light,admitted through
a minute aperture into a dark room, its shadow will appear materially larger
than it ought if light passes its edges in straight lines; and, moreover, that any
opaque object, large or small, exhibits along the edges of its shadow a border
of at least three distinctly tinted fringes, the brightest and broadest of which is
next the shadow. He also observed that when two minute pencils of light are
admitted through apertures very near to each other, the screen on which the
blended pencils fall, and which, as he supposed, ought to be uniformly illu-
minated with a light equal to the sum of the two intensities, is streaked with lines
absolutely dark. He was led by this observation to announce the paradoxicat
proposition that there are cireumstances in which the union of two rays of light
produces darkness. Bold as this announcement must have originally appeared,
the progress of scientific discovery has fully confirmed its truth. ‘This phenom-
enon, being attributed to the bending of the rays of light in the immediate
vicinity of the opaque body, was distinguished by the name inflection or diffrac-
tion. It was carefully studied by Newton and others, and has occupied a prom-
inent place in ali the discussions which have since arisen in regard to the nature
of light.

Not far from the time of the discovery of Grimaldi, just mentioned, the atten-
tion of the scientific world was calied to a case of new and extraordinary refrae-
tion observed to take place in crystals of carbonate of lime—a species of retrac-
tion, which, from the circumstance of its dividmg an imcident beam into two
beams entirely distinct, or of presenting two images of any object seen through the
erystal, has been called double refraction. ‘The first publication on this subject
was made by Erasmus Bartholinus, a physician of Copenhagea, who gave to
the mineral the name of Iceland spar, from the circumstance that his specimens
had been obtained from that island. Jt is now known that this property of
double refraction is exceedingly common, being possessed by most crystallized
bodies, and capabie of being produced, transiently or permanently, in any trans-
parent solid whatever, whether organic or mineral, in which it does not naturally
exist. It is only in Iceland spar, however, that it manifests itself in a degree
remarkable enough to attract the attention of a casual observer, and in most
cases li can only be detected by special arrangements.

DOUBLE REFRACTION. Bi ts)

Iceland spar is favorable to observations upon double refraction, not only on
account of its wide separation of the refracted rays, but also because of the size
of the crystals which can be obtained of this mineral, and of their beautiful
transparency. Its primitive crystalline form is the rhombohedron. Whatever
may be the configuration of the mass as obtained from its native bed, it will be
found to cleave with great facility in directions parallel to the faces of the
original rhombohedron, and it is thus easily reduced to a form favorable for ex-
periment. The angles of the rhomboidal faces are 101° 55’ and 78° 5’. The

z inclinations of the faces upon each other are 105° 5! and.
74° 55’. Two of the solid angles are contained by-three
of the obtuse angles of the rhomboids, and the other six
by two acute and one obtuse each. “The diagonal con-
necting the two exceptional solid angles is the shortest

Fig. 4. of the diagonals of the rhombohedron, and is called the
crystallographic axis. ‘These angles themselves are called the vertical, and the
other six the lateral, angles of the crystal.

If a mark be made with ink upon a sheet of white paper—a small cross for
example—and a rhomboid of Iceland spar, two or three inches in thickness, be
laid over it, then in whatever position the eye may be placed above the upper
surface of the crystal, two crosses will be seen. If the erystal be turned about
upon its horizontal face, one of these images will remain motionless, and the
other will describe a circle around it. The motionless image will, moreover,
appear sensibly nearer to the eye than the other. If, instead of a small mark.
we take a straight line ruled entirely across the paper as an object, then, if the
eye be placed vertically over the line, and the erystal interposed, it will be seen
that the nearer image is always a continuation of the part of che line seen
beyond the erystal on each side, while the more distant one is more or less dis-
placed laterally. In revolving the crystal, moreover, this second image will
pass from one side to the other of the first, and.a position will be found (or
rather two positions, differing from each other by 180°) ia which the two images
apparently coincide, though, as they are differently distant, they are merely
superposed.

Until the discovery of this remarkable property in Iceland spar, refraction
was supposed to be governed in all cases by the law of Snellius. But it is im-
possible that this should be true of both the rays in the present case. It is, in
fact, true only of that one which produces the nearer and fixed image. This is,
for distinction, called the ordinary ray ; the other, the extraordinary.

If the vertical angles of the rhombohedron he truncated perpendicularly to
the crystallographic axis, and the artificial faces thus formed polished, it will be
found that when the crystal is laid over a small object upon one of these faces,
and the eye placed immediately over it, only one image will be visible. This is
not an illusion occasioned by the superposition of images differentiy distant ;
there is actually but oneimage. But if the emergent ray coming tv the eye, by
which the object is seen, be at all inclined to the surface, the imige will be
duplicated, and the degree of separation of the two images will increase with
the inclination. If the lateral edges of the crystal are cui away, so as to form
a parallelopipedon, whose faces are parallel to the erystaliographic axis, and the
crystal be laid on its side, the separation of the images will be at its maximum.
In this case, if the emergent visual ray be perpendicular to the surface, the two
images will be superposed, but the duplicity will be very perceptible.

It appears, then, that there is one directiou in the erystal, in which light may
pass without double refraction, and tha. this direction corresponds with that of
the erystallographic axis. This direction is also called the eptic axis; but the
term optic axis, it must be observed, is not intended to denote a particular Kine,
but only a particular direction, and in the present case it is a line anywhere in
the crystal parallel to the axis of symmetry.

116 DOUBLE REFRACTION.

Any plane parallel to the axis of the erystal necessarily coincides with the
optie axis, and every such plane is called a principal plane or principal section.
This term is one of very convenient use. Any plane at right angles to the optic
axis (and therefore to all the principal planes) may be called a conjugate plane or
section, which term will be also found to have its convenience. In every such
conjugate plane the separation of the two rays by double refraction is at its
maximum; and, what is also important, the extraordinary ray, as well as the
ordinary, obeys in this plane the law of Snellius. ‘The indexes of refraction for
the two are, however, necessarily different; that of the ordinary ray being
1.6543, and that of the extraordinary, 1.4833. In directions which do not
correspond with either a principal or a conjugate plane, the index of refrac-
tion of the ordinary ray will be found to be invariably the same, but that of
the extraordinary ray will gradually increase from the direction perpendicular
to the axis to that which coincides with the axis. In this last case the two in-
dexes become equal, and double refraction disappears. The index of the ex-
traordinary ray at any inclination (denoted by @) with the optic axis, may be
found from the following formula, in which x= 1.6543, n/— 1.4833, and N is
the index sought:

N=V 22 —(n?—n?) sin2a= V 2.7367 — 0.5365 sina.

We see now why it is that one of the images seen through the erystal is
apparently nearer than the other. ‘The general effect of refraction by a single
plane surtace of a body denser than air, is, as has been already illustrated, to
bring the object apparently nearer to the surface. This effect must depend for
its degree upon the refracting power, and this power is a direct function of the
index of refraction. ‘The indexes of the two rays are different, and therefore
the apparent distances of their images are different likewise.

One of the most remarkable facts connected with the refraction of the ex-
traordinary ray is that, unless the incidence is in the plane of a principal section,
or of a conjugate section, the refracted ray is not in the plane of incidence. And
if the refracting surface, whether the natural surface of the crystal or one artifi-
cially prepared, be not coincident with a principal or a conjugate plane, the
extraordinary ray is bent at the surface, even when the incidence is perpendicular.

In observing through the crystal prepared by truncating its vertices by
conjugate planes. in which case we have the advantage of having both refracted
rays in all positions in the plane of incidence, we shall see that the extraordinary
ray is always the most distant from the normal to the surface. But this normal
represents the direction of the optic axis. ‘The extraordinary ray, therefore,
has the semblance of being repelled from this axis. As there are crystals in
which the’ apparent effects are reversed, that is, in which the extraordinary ray
is nearer to the optic axis than the ordinary. as if it were attracted, these two
classes have been distinguished by the terms negative and positive. In the
negative the extraordinary index is less than the ordinary; in the positive.
greater.

A curious observation in regard to the paths of the two rays through a crystal
of Iceland spar, by which an object at a litle distance beyond it is scen, origi-
nally made by Monge, may be mentioned here. The object
being at O, and the eye being at E, the ordinary image
will appear above the extraordinary and nearer, as at O’,
O” being the extraordinary image. The emergent rays
are therefore P/E and Q'E. But the rays incident on the
under side of the crystal from the object must be resp-c-
tively parallel to these. Draw then OP parallel to P’E,

Fig. 5. and OQ parallel to Q’E, and join PP’, QQ’. The en-

’ tire path of the ordinary ray is then OPP'E, and that of

the extraordinary is OQQ’E, which lines, when the plane of incidence is a
principal plane, necessarily cross each other in the crystal.

DOUBLE REFRACTION. AT

If a card be passed along the under surface of the erystal, in the direction
RR, it will cut off the ray OP before interfering with OQ. The image 0’,
which is most distant from the card, is therefore first to disappear—a phenome-
non very striking when seen for the first time. The card employed in this
experiment should be dull black in order to produce the best etiect, otherwise it
is too conspicuous itself.

When a ray of light, after having passed through one crystal and having been
divided into two distinct emergent rays, is allowed to fall upon another similar
and equal crystal similarly situated, the effect, as might naturally be expected,
will be to increase the separation of the rays to the same extent as would have
occurred had both the crystals been united in one. But if the second erystal
be turned around the direction of the ray as an axis, other phenomena make
their appearance, the character of which depends on the amount of turning. In
speaking of this kind of revolution it will be convenient to employ the term
azimuth. By this word is meant direction in space in a plane at right angles
to any axial line. ‘Che term is adopted from astronomy and geodesy, in which
sciences the assumed axial line is the vertical, and the azimuthal plane the
horizon.

In the case in hand, if we completely reverse the position of the second
crystal in azimuth, that is to say, turn it round 180°, it will reverse the refract-
ing effect of the first crystal and reunite the two rays, which will emerge as
one. If we turn it only 90° in azimuth the separation of the rays will con-
tinue, but that which was the extraordinary ray in the first crystal will become
the ordinary in the second, and vice versa. Accordingly, if the original inci-
dence is perpendicular, the ray which follows the normal in the first erystal will
be bent at the surface of the second, and that which is bent at the surface of the
first will follow the normal on entering the second.

At any azimuth differing from the original position more or less than 90° or
180° there will be seen four emergent rays, of which two will usually possess
a greater intensity than the other two. When the change of position of the
second crystal is but slight, the two original rays will be vivid; but, in a linea
right angles to that which connects them, two very taint ones will appear, nearer
together than the original two. As the rotation advances these new rays will
gain in strength, while the other two grow less intense. At the azimuth of 45°
the four will be equal and equidistant. Beyond 45° the original rays go on
fading and the new ones increasing in brightness, until, at 90°, the former become
entirely extinct and the new ones remain alone. Beyond 90° again another
faint pair appear, which go on, as before, increasing in brightness, at the expense
of the companion pair, up to the azimuth 135°, when the four are again equal.
Beyond 135° this second new pair still continue to gain strength and to approach
each other, till, at the azimuth 1809, they reunite into one, and the others in their
turn vanish. In the figure following, these successive phases are shown as
they appear upon a screen when the experiment is performed in a dark room.
They are circumscribed by the outlines of the two rhombs in their relative sue-
cessive positions.

The phenomena of double refraction were carefully studied by the celebrated
Huyghens, who devised a physical theory for their explanation, which has been
pronounced by Brewster to be one of the most splendid of the triumphs of genius
which illustrate the history of science. His theory did not, however, extend te
the explanation of the remarkable appearances last described, which present

themselves when two doubly refracting rhombs are combined—appearances
which were observed by him with surprise and perplexity. They are now
known to be owing to a remarkable modification of light which always accom-
panies double refraction, though it may be produced in other ways, and which
is called polarization. This will occupy much of our attention further on.

Soon after his announcement of the compound nature of light, Sir Isaac
Newton made public the results of his ingenious investigations in regard to the
colors exhibited by ¢hza plates of transparent substances, such as soap-bubbles,
films of moisture upon glass and upon polished opaque solids, laminz of air
confined in fissures of transparent minerals, &c. He showed that the tints dis-
played by such thin plates, when viewed in common light, depend upon three
conditions, viz: the thickness of the plate, its refracting power, and the angle
of obliquity under which it is viewed. The determination of the relation of the
tint to the thickness, was made by means of a very simple contrivance. A
double-convex lens, of very long focus, was placed in contact with the plane
surface of a plano-convex lens, the two being pressed together by means of
screws. In Newton’s experiments the double-convex lens was beneath and the
plano-convex above. ‘The convexity of the upper surface of the upper lens is
advantageous when oblique observations are desired, as tending to reduce the
refraction of the incident and emergent rays at that surface. The two touching
surfaces have, theoretically, but a single point of contact, and that point is the
centre of a thin plate of included air, of which the thick-
ness increases from zero equally in all directions. ‘The
law of this increase will be apparent from the figure
annexed. MN represents the lower surface of the supe-
rior glass, and QR the upper surface of the inferior. Let
C be the centre of the sphere of which QR is a super-
ficial section. Put 7 for the radius CP. Then, if the
ares Pa, P), are small in proportion to the whole circum-
ference, we shall have

2 =

Or, if 2 stand generally for the thickness Aa or Bé,and y for the corres-
ponding distance from the point of contact, PA or PB, we shall have the vari-
ation, recy”.

This furnishes a law by which, when the thickness corresponding to a single
assigned value of y is known, the thickness for all other values may be com-
puted with great facility.

The apparatus being arranged as above described, the colors which are seen
by reflected light are arranged in regular rings around a black centre and in suc-
cessive series, as follows:

Black, blue, white, yellow, red.

Violet, blue, green, yellow, red.

Purple, blue, green, yellow, red.
Green, red.

Greenish blue, red.

Greenish blue, pale red.

. Greenish blue, reddish white.

These are what Newton calls the successive orders of colors, and, in referring
lo any particular tint, it is designated as the blue, red, green, &c., of the first,
second, or third order, as the case may be. Beyond the fourth order the colors
become feeble or begin to fade rapidly out into whiteness, and, beyond the
seventh, color can scarcely be at all perceived. The cause of this fading may
be made manifest by employing homogeneous or monochromatic light; that is
to say, light of a single tint only, obtained by isolating a portion of the rays of

ee
COLORS OF THIN PLATES. 119

the prismatic spectrum whose refrangibility and color are sensibly the same.
Then very many more bright rings will be observed, separated by intermediate
rings entirely dark. But what is of most importance at present is that those
which are formed by the least refrangible rays are larger than any others, and
that the diameters of rings of the same order regularly diminish as the refran-
gibility increases. ‘This difference of magnitude between the rings of different
tints occasions the overlapping of one color upon another when white light is
used, so that the colors observed are not simple but resultant colors, determined
in their tints by the simple colors which happen to be predominant at any point.
The other components serve, with some portion of the predominant tint, to pro-
duce white light, by which the tint is diluted and rendered more feeble than it
would otherwise be. The truth of this explanation will be made apparent by
viewing the rings through a prism. The effect will be to make the overlap-
ping on one side more complete than before, and, on the other side, less. The
rings will be less highly colored but more numerous and better separated on the
side of greatest refraction, and more confused on the other.

From a careful measurement of the diameters of all the bright rings, Sir
Isaac Newton ascertamed that the squares of these diameters form a regular
arithmetical progression, corresponding to the natural series of odd numbers, 1,
3, 5, 7, &e. And the squares of the diameters of the intermediate dark rings
were found to constitute another similar progression, corresponding to the series
of even numbers, 2, 4,6, &c. From the law aay’, it therefore follows that
the bright rings appear where the thickness of the plate is once, thrice, five times,
&c., some constant value, and that the dark rings appear where the thickness is
twice, four times, siz times, &c., the same constant value. The next question
to be determined is, therefore, what is that constant?

In order to ascertain this, Sir Isaac Newton measured with great precision
the absolute diameter of the fifth dark ring. This, with the known radius of the
spherical surface of the lens, enabled him to compute the thickness of the plate
at that ring, this thickness being the versed sine in a great circle of the sphere
of an are of which the measured diameter is the chord. The result gave him
soeo0 Of an inch, very nearly, for the thickress of the plate at the fifth dark
ring. But the fifth number in the series 2, 4, 6, &c., is 10. Hence, the con-
stant sought for is one-tenth of s5255 of an inch, or 77),5), and this is the
thickness of the plate at the point where the greatest brightness of the first
bright ring is seen. Reduced to a decimal, it gives a little more than fifty-six
ten-millionths of an inch. If the value of this constant be sought for the several
homogeneous rays, it will be found to be, for the violet, a little more than thirty-
nine ten-millionths, and, for the red, not quite sixty-nine ten-millionths. As, in
the space occupied by the colors of the first order, the thicknesses vary slowly,
and as there is a certain range of variation in thickness within which each color
may appear, though its greatest intensity is in the middle of this range, it
happens that the colors of the first order are dilute, especially toward the centre
of the system, and that the middle of the series is white. In the succeeding
orders, the differences tell in such a manner that the bright rings of some colors
fall more or less exactly upon the dark rings of others, and the tints become
stronger. But, as the thicknesses soon begin to vary rapidly, every system of
rings becomes crowded, and the separating dark intervals grow narrower and
narrower, until there is a complete blending of tints at every point and the
resultant is sensibly white. When water is introduced between the glasses, the
rings become immediately smaller. If the thickness at which a given tint now
appears is compared with that at which the same tint appeared in air, it is found
to be reduced in the ratio of 2 to 1, x being the index of refraction between air
and water. This law admits of being generalized. In fact, whatever be the
substance of the thin plates in which these tints appear, the thicknesses which
produce them are inversely proportional to their indexes of refraction.
120 COLORS OF THICK PLATES.

When the system of lenses described above is held between the eye and the
light, another system of rings makes its appearance, which is formed by the
transmitted light. In this case the tints are much feebler, being diluted by the
intermixture of a great deal of white light, which, as we shall see hereafter, has
nothing to do with their formation. Of these it is remarkable that the diame-
ters of the bright rings correspond with those of the dark rings seen by reflec-
tion. Thus the thicknesses at which the bright rings by transmitted light
appear form a series corresponding with the progression of even numbers, 0, 2,
4, 6, &c.; and the thicknesses at which the intervening dark rings are seen cor-

- respond to the progression 1, 3, 5,7, &c. Also the tints reflected and trans-
mitted at any given point are complementary to each other, or are such as,
united, produce white.
The measurements above given are those which correspond to rings formed
by light perpendicularly incident upon the thin lamina. But when the rings
are observed obliquely, their diameters are rapidly enlarged with increase of
obliquity. Sir Isaac Newton ascertained the law of this increase to be this:
that the squares of the diameters are inversely as the cosines of incidence.
When the incidence exceeded 602, it appeared to him that this law no longer
held good; and this conclusion, which, up to a recent period, had not been
invalidated, has formed a serious difliculty in the way of any theory of light.
Recent experiments, however, made by Messrs. Provostaye and Desains, with
monochromatic light, and with special arrangements to eliminate the sources of
error in measurement which must have vitiated Newton’s results at high inci-
dences, have fully established the universality of the law. ‘Their measurements
extended to the forty-third ring, and to the great incidence of 86° 14’, beyond
which the rings were no longer discernible.
Colors resembling those of thin plates may be produced also, in various modes,
by means of thick plates. Sir Isaac Newton employed, in an interesting experi-
ment of this kind, a spherical glass mirror, with truly concentricsurfaces, silvered
on the back. A very small beam of light (about one
twenty-fifth of an inch in diameter) having been intro-
duced inté a dark room, he received it on this mirror in
such a manner as to reflect it back toward the aperture.
iii) At the centre of curvature of the mirror he placed a white

| card pierced, in order to allow the light to pass, with a
very small orifice. Around this orifice he saw a series of
rings resembling those of thin plates. When the light
was homogeneous, the rings were alternately bright and dark as in the other case.
The diameters were also observed to follow similar laws. As both surfaces of
the mirror are concerned in producing these rings, and as, at the first surface,
it is the irregular or scattered reflection only which is necessary to the effect,
the experiment succeeds best with a mirror in which this surface is not highly
polished. Instead of the perforated card, a lamina of mica, or of slightly tar-
nished glass, may be employed to receive the rings.

When light is transmitted through or reflected by a pair of thick plates of
homogeneous glass, with parallel plane surfaces,
and placed parallel to each other. colors may ap-
pear, if the difference of thickness of the two plates
is comparable to the absolute thickness at which
such colors are produced by thin plates. ‘The
figure shows the arrangement. Dr. Brewster pro-
duced the same effects with a pair of plates of
equal thickness, by inclining one of them so that
the path of the rays within it should be slightly
longer than within the other. ‘There is some sim
ilarity between the first of these classes of phenomena and those of diffraction,
The second have a nearer analogy to the eolors of Newton’s rings.

PROGRESSIVE MOTION OF LIGHT. 1Oq

The next important step in the progress of optical science was the discovery
of the progressive motion of light, and the determination of its velocity. 'Uhough
every theory which had ever been suggested to account for the phenomena “of
light presumed that there must be a progress from the luminous origin, and
feos that time must be an element in the solution of every optical proble m,
still so nearly instantaneous are all the effects produced at the distances to
which our ordinary observation extends, as apparently to render hopeless any
plan for experimentally determining the velocity. This circumstance rendered
the efforts made by the celebrated Galileo, and by the academicians of Florence,
to settle the question, completely nugatory. The method of proceeding adopted
by Galileo was to place himself upon an eminence opposite to an assistant
observer something more than a mile distant ; both being provided with lanterns
which could be darkened by a slide. The lights being arranged, Galileo dark-
ened his lantern; and the assistant, immediately on noticing its disappearance,
darkened his also. Apparently both were extinguished at the same instant.
The Florentine academicians repeated the experiment, increasing the distance
between the stations, but the result was the same. The problem remained
unsolved; but its solution came at last, when demanded by the exigencies of a
higher | branch of science.

In 1675 Reemer, an astronomer of Copenhagen, in his observations upon the
eclipses of the first satellite of Jupiter, became perplexed by irregularities for
which he could conceive no means of accounting. It was suggested by Dominic
Cassini that these difficulties might perhaps be re emoved by supposing that the time
occupied by light in passing through the vast distance between Jupiter and our
planet may be] arge enough to be appreciable; and therefore that, as our dis-
tance varies, this time must vary also. Assuming this hypothesis to be true,
and that the epoch on which our computations of future eclipses are founded is
the date of some eclipse actually observed when the two bodies were occupying
their points of nearest approach, it will follow that if the accuracy of the deter-
minations is affected only by the motion of light, all subsequent eclipses,
observed when the distance is the same as at the epoch, will agree with the
prediction, and all others will be in retardation by an amount of time equal to
that which light requires to pass over she space by which the distance has been
increased. In like manner, if the epoch had been an eclipse observed in the
position of greatest distance between the bodies, subsequent eclipses would be
in advance of the prediction; and if the epoch had been an observation made
from some position intermediate between the points of greatest and least distance,
the eclipses afterwards occurring would be sometimes in advance and some-
times in retardation. The test of the correctness of the hypothesis would be a
careful comparison of the observed irregularities of time with the variations of
distance—a comparison involving no slight labor. Cassini, with whom the idea
originated, seems to have abandoned it; but Roemer followed it up with such
perseverance as at length conclusively to establish its truth. He demonstrated
that the time occupied by light in passing over the entire diameter of the earth’s
orbit is 16 minutes and 26 seconds. But at that period the dimensions of the
earth’s orbit were not accurately known, and this determination was insuflicient to
fix the absolute value of the velocity of light. Assuming the sun’s mean parallax
to be 8.'6, the mean diameter of the orbit must be about 190,000,000 of miles,
and this number divided by 986, the number of seconds in 16 minutes and 26
seconds, gives for the velocity in miles 192,700.

The velocity of light has, since the time of Roemer, been ascertained, with a
probably near approximation to the truth, by ether independent methods, and
the results tend to confirm the substantial correctness of his original determina-
tion., The first of these methods is that which rests upon the measurement of
the aberration of the stars, a phenomenon discovered by Bradley, afterwards
122 VELOCITY OF LIGHT.

astronomer royal of England, in 1728. This aberration consists im an apparent
displacement of the star from its true position by the com-
2 eg bined influence of the motion of the earth and the progressive ,

oie remaining parallel to itself as the earth moves, in conse-
quence of the immense distance of the star. Also, allowing
progressive propagation of light, if the earth were without motion, the star would
still appear in its true direction. OS, the telescope OP remaining stationary ;
but if we suppose both the earth and light to move, then a ray entering the
centre of the tube OP, at the summit, would not be in the centre of the tube
when it reached the lower end, but would be displaced toward the rear by a
small space equal to the earth’s own motion while the ray is descending the
tube. T'o the observer at O, therefore, the telescope would not appear to be truly
pointed at the star, but would require to to be leaned forward in the direction
OP, until the luminous elements which compose the ray (whatever they may
be, should follow accurately the axis of the telescope from top to bottom. The
star will accordingly seem to be at S’, in advance of its.true position, in the
direction of the earth’s motion. The amount of this apparent displacement will
vary with the angle made by the direction of the earth’s movement with the
direction of the star. When this angle is zero, that is to say when the earth is
moving di.ectly toward or from the star, the displacement is zero; when the
angle is 90°, or when the earth’s motion is directly across the line drawn to the
star, it is maximum. For a star in the plane of the earth’s orbit, the aberration
is apparently an oscillation in a straight line, the duration of the movement in
the aliernately opposite directions being six months ; for a star in the pole of the
ecliptic, or in a direction at right angles to its plane, the apparent path would be
a very small ellipse similar to the earth’s orbit. The major axis of this ellipse
would measure the maximum amount of aberration on both sides of the true
place, and this is found to be equal to 40.88; half of this, or 20”.44, is the
maximum absolute amount of displacement. ‘The direction of a star, therefore,
when its aberration is maximum, deviates from its true direction as the diagonal
of a rectangle deviates from the side. If, in such a rectangle, the smaller side
be made equal to the velocity of the earth, the larger will be the velocity of
light, and the angle between the larger side and the diagonal will be 20'.44.
But the earth’s velocity per second is known, and is about 18.9 miles; hence the
velocity of light is 18.9 x cot20’’.44—190,730 miles, a number less than that
before obtained by about one one-hundredth part.

This coincidence of results is sufficiently remarkable, when we consider the
extreme delicacy of such measurements as those by which aberration is de-
termined, and also the difficulty of fixing, by observation, the exact instant
of the immersion or emersion of one of Jupiter’s satellites; but, these difficulties
apart, there is nothing surprising in the agreement, since both depend at last
for their absolute values upon our received horizontal parallax of the sun.

Results very nearly similar, however, have been recently obtained by experi-
mental methods founded upon principles entirely different from the foregoing.
The first of these methods was devised by Mr. Fizeau, of Paris, and executed
by him in the vicinity of that city. Having selected two stations, visible from
VELOCITY OF LIGHT. 123

‘ each other, and about 54 miles apart, he placed
fwo tubes, something like tubes of telescopes,
one at each station, looking towards cach
other, with their axes in the same straight line.
One of these tubes, represented at AB, has a
branch tube E furnished with lenses, through
which is received the light from a radiant point
S. This light is reflected by an inclined trans-
parent plane mirror m, forming a bright image

of the luminous point at s, which is in the principal focus of the large lens B.
The rays being made parallel by this lens, are received at the other station upon
the lens C, by which they are brought to a focus upon the surface of a plans
mirror D. Being reflected back by this mirror, they return to the lens B, and once
more form a bright image at s, which image may he observed through the trans-
parent mirror m, by an eye placed at A. The upper side of the tube at F, just
in front of the plane mirror, is cut through in order to admit the limb of a wheel,
furnished with teeth, to descend so far into it that the i image s may be seen be-
tween the teeth or cut off by them, according to the position of the whecl. The
teeth amd the intervening spaces are of exactly equal breadth. By means of
connected gear-work a ‘high velocity of rotation may be given to the wheel,
while the number of turns per second admits of being ascertained. The
velocity may also be retarded by a brake. When the wheel turns slowly
the light is intermittent, and the passage of the teeth is perceptible, But when
as many as ten tecth pass per second, the light is constant, owing to the dura-
tion of the successive impressions upon the eye. By accelerating the movement
the brightness of the image may presently be made to fade, in consequence of
the interference of the successive teeth with the rays returning from the distant
station, after having passed through the last preceding interval between the
teeth. As the velocity increases this fading will become an absolute extinction,
each tooth in its progress cutting off all the light which passed through the in-
terval before it. When this state of things is reached, it is evident that the time
occupied in the passage of light to the distant station and back—that is to say,
102 miles—is equal to the time which it takes for a tooth to advance a dis-
tance equal to its own breadth. If there are five hundred teeth and five hun-
dred intervening spaces, this time will be one one-thousandth part of that of a
revolution; and if there are eighteen revolutions in a second, the absolute time
will be one eighteen-thousandth of a second.

By still further accelerating the velocity of rotation, the light may presently
be made to reappear; the rays which pass through one opening to the distant
station, returning through the next following opening to the eye. When the
full brightness is thus restored, the velocity will be found to have been doubled.
By carrying the acceleration still further, the light may be a second time eclipsed
and a second time restored; and, in like manner, alternately extinguished and
revived, as long as the driving power will allow: the velocities at which the
several successive extinctions and revivals occur, constituting a regularly increas-
ing arithmetical series.

We thus are enabled to measure the small fraction of a second required for
light to pass over twice the distance between the two stations; and dividing this
double distance by this fraction we obtain the velocity of light per second. The
result at first obtained by Mr. Fizeau, by means of this apparatus, was about
196,000 miles, being in excess of the results by the astronomical methods by
one-sixtieth part nearly.

It is manifest that < any mode by which very minute intervals of time can be
accurately measured, is capable of being employed as a means of dete rmining
the velocity of light. Mr. Wihtentetec. i in his researches upon the velocity of
electricity, employed for this purpose a revolving mirror; and in 1839, Mr.

TOA VELOCITY OF LIGHT.

Arago made an effort, by the use of a similar mirror, to institute a comparison
between the velocities of light in passing through water and through air. This
was suggested by him as an experimentum crucis between the opposing theo-
ries current in regard to the nature of light; in one of which light was sup-
posed to consist of material particles actually thrown off by luminous bodies,
while in the other it was assumed to be an effect of undulations propagated
through an exceedingly subtle elastic medium pervading all space. If the first
were “ahe true theory, the velocity of light in a more powerfully refracting
medium should be greater than in a less; and the reverse, if the second were
true. Mr. Arago ava not carry out his design to its completion, but it has since
been successfully executed by both Mr. Fizeau, whose original method has just
been given, and by Mr. Foucault, well known for his pendulum demonstration
of the earth’s rotation. The experiment served at once to compare the veloci-
ties of light in air and water, and to determine the absolute velocity. The an-
nexed figure may render the method intelligible. Suppose a small beam of

parallel rays to be admitted into a room otherwise dark, through an aperture R,
and to fall wpon an achromatic lens, fixed at C, in the direction of its axis. Let
CD be the focal distance of this lens; and at M let the beam be intercepted by a
mirror capable of turning around a vertical axis coincident with its plane. At
a distance, ME==MD, in any convenient position not very remote from R, let
there be placed aspherical mirror having its centre of curvature in the axis of M.

Let there be, further, across the aperture R a fine wire exactly vertical ;
and in front of the aperture R a transparent plane mirror AB, inclined
to the beam at an angle of 45°. The mirror M may obviously be turned
on its pivot, so that the ray RCM falling upon it may be refle cted to E. If
it remain stationary in this position, the light incident on E will be returned to
M, and so again to the aperture R. But a portion of this returning light, being
reflected by “AB towards O, will enable an observer at that point to see the im-
age of the vertical wire. To assist the eye, a magnifying eye-piece may be em-
ploy ed, and this may be provided with a spider-line micrometer at its focus. If
the mirror be new put very slowly into revolution, the image of the wire will be
seen intermittently and momentarily, once in every revolution. ‘The spider-line
of the eye-piece is now to be brought to exact coincidence with this image.
Accelerating the revolution, when the number of turns per second becomes as
great as ten, the image will be permanent. If, now, a very high velocity be
given to the mirror, the image seen by the observer at O will no longer coincide
with the spider-line of the micrometer, but will be seen at a sensible distance from
it in the direction of rotation. Thus, if the arrow represent the direction of
rotation, the returning ray which originally met the mirror A B at 7, will meet it
at 7’ or 7’, and the image which originally appeared at S will be seen at S’/ or 8”.
This is evidently owing to the change in the position of the mirror M, while
VELOCITY OF LIGHT IN WATER AND AIR. 135
the light is moving from it to the spherical mirror E and back again; and the
angular displacement of the returning ray around the centre M will, according
to the well-known law of reflection, he double the angular change of position oF
the mirror. If the mirror makes 2 turns in a second, the time of one turn will
be the zth part of a second, and the time of making the change of position of
which the observation gives us the evidence, will be the same fraction of the nth
part of a second that ae alf the angle subtended by RR‘ or RR", as the case
may be, at the centre M, is of 360°; or as 4RR’ is of a whole circumference.
This distance RR’ or RR", being equal to ‘SS! or SS”, is directly measured
by the micrometer. Let it be put — —%. The circumference of the circle whose
radius is RM, (which put —~7,) is 2zxr. Put the space ME=s, or 2ME=

light. 'Then—

# This expression is, however, true only on the assumption that the returning
ray suffers no deviation in passing the lens ©. But since, if its original path
was, as we have assumed, the axis of the lens, it cannot, if sensibly deviated,
return through the axis, it will be bent at C, and the displacement RM’ will be
less than we have assumed it to be. If D be the actually observed ee
and if RCO be represented by 7’ and MC by s’, then the value of our assumed
displacement in the above formula will become, as may easily be shown—

Substituting this value, we shall have for the velocity of light—
Sxnr's?
~— D(s+s')

With a distance s = 4 metres, and 800 turns of the mirror per second, Mr.
Foucault found a value of D— 6”, whence the value of v is found to be, in
English miles, 192,950.*

By placing a second fixed mirror, F’, in any other convenient position, and
interposing a tube, as GH, filled with water or any other transparent medium,
the ends of the tube being closed with plate glass having parallel surfaces, the
velocities of light in air and such a medium may be compared, The mirrors E and
F will both give images of the wire at R; and if the value of v is the same for
both, the two images will be coincident, and appear as one; but if v have dif-
ferent values for the different media, one of the images will be more displaced
than the other. Mr. Foucault performed this experiment; and, in order to
identify the images, and to distinguish one from the other, he placed before the
mirror E a screen having a rectangular opening, such that one-third part of the
image from that mirror should be cut off from the top, and another third from
the bottom, the central third only being left unobstructed. In the image of the
aperture at R, as seen at O, the middle third had, very sensibly, greater bright-
ness than the top or the bottom, and the wire, as reflected from E, was appar-
ently but one-third as long as it appeared reflected from F. The image from F
was sensibly the most displaced, indicating lower velocity in water than in air;
the displacement, D, in the formula above, being a factor of the denominator.

The next discovery of importance in the progress of optical science was made
near the close of the last century, by Dr. Wollaston, in his observations upon
the prismatic spectrum. He discovered that, by employing a pencil of light

* By Mr. Foucault's more recent experiments with this method, the velocity of light is
reduced to 190,249.16 miles.
126 LINES IN THE SPECTRUM.

very narrow in the direction of the plane of refraction, but broad parallel to the
axis of the prism, five well-defined dark straight lines could be distinguished
crossing the spectrum at right angles, and maintaining invariably the same posi-
tions relatively to the colors. This number he afterwards increased to seven.
These lines may very easily be distinguished by holding a prism near the eye,
parallel to any small fissure through which light makes its way into a dark
room. ‘The reason they escaped the notice of Newton and other earlier ob-
servers is to be found in the fact that those observers employed a pencil so
broad in the direction of refraction as to make the actually observed spectrum a
compound of many superposed and unconformable spectra, thereby obliterating
these very narrow markings. In fact, every point in an aperture of sensible
magnitude, through which the light experimented on is introduced into the dark
room, produces a spectrum of its own. Moreover, supposing that it is the sun-
light which is introduced through the aperture; it may be said that every point
of the aperture produces not only one spectrum, but as many spectra as there
are points in the sun’s disk from which lines may be drawn to the assumed
point in the aperture. As all these lines, so drawn, would, in the absence of the
prism, produce a white circular image of the sun upon the screen in the dark
room, having a diameter increasing with the distance of the sereen from the
aperture, it follows that, when the prism is introduced, the spectrum produced
by each point of the aperture will have a breadth equal to the diameter of this
white image of the sun, and that its elongated form is due to the lateral unequal
displacement of an indefinite number of circles, produced by the several elemen-
tary rays of which white light is made up. ‘The interposition of a convex lens
between the prism and the aperture may serve to reduce the breadth and sharpen
the boundary of the image; but still it is manifest that with a circular aperture,
there must, unless the diameter is made too small for convenient observation, be
a considerable mixture of rays of different refrangibility in every part of the.
length. It is therefore best, for the purpose of obtaining a spectrum at once
broad and pure, to employ an aperture very narrow in the plane of resraction,
and broad in the direction of the axis of the prism. ‘This may be still further
improved by the use of a convex lens of long focus, as above described ; or bet-
ter, by the use of a cylindrical lens, with its cylindrical axis parallel to the length
of the aperture. With an arrangement like this, the lines of Dr. Wollaston may
be easily exhibited, and many more. By aiding the eye with a telescope, the
number discovered becomes surprisingly great. Mr. Fraunhofer, of Munich,
enumerated five hundred and ninety, and Sir David Brewster afterward in-
creased this number to two thousand. Their general appearance under the tele-
scope is shown in the figure annexed.

The eight principal lines are distinguished by the letters A to H, of which
the line A is at the beginning of the red, and the line H about the middle of the
violet. ‘The line A does not appear in the figure. The positions of these lines
being definitely fixed among the colors of the spectrum, they furnish valuable
aid in comparing the refracting powers of different bodies, and have served to
reveal the fact that bodies whose mean refractive powers are equal, do not always
equally refract the several elementary rays. The line A is not among the most
easily discernible, but Sir David Brewster has discovered others in the almost
imperceptible light below A; and Sir John Herschel, and especially Professor
POLARIZATION OF LIGHT. LO

Stokes, have discovered many others still beyond the violet. By his curious
discovery of fluorescence, or the property possessed by some substances of ren-
dering serisible to vision rays beyond the limit of the ordinary spectrum, Pro-
fessor Stokes has in fact quadrupled its length.*

In observing the spectra formed by light from other sources than the sun, as
from the fixed stars, from incandescent solids, flames, &c., great differences are
found to exist in regard to the lines observed. In the spectra of the fixed stars,
dark lines are seen, which, like those of the solar spectrum, are unchangeable
in position, but which do not occupy the same positions. In the spectra of
flames, lines are observed which are not dark, but bright. Different salts added
to the wick of an alcohol lamp produce different systems of lines, always bright.
So, likewise, metals burned under the compound blow-pipe. The spectrum of
the electrie spark exhibits bright lines also, the positions and numbers of which
depend on the substances of which the electrodes are formed. A platinum wire
made incandescent by an electric current, gives no lines at all; and none are
seen in the spectrum formed from the light of the solid carbon electrodes which
produce the galvanic arch. Experiments made by Sir David Brewster, by pass-
ing solar or artificial light through different colored gases, led him to the con-
clusion that the dark lines are caused by absorption—an absorption which he
supposed to take place in the earth’s atmosphere.t

In the year 1808 the French Academy of Sciences proposed the problem of
the double refraction.of light as the subject of a prize to be awarded two years
thereafter. The successful competitor for this prize was Malus. To him is due
the discovery of the polarization of light by reflection. He was led to this re-
markable discovery by an accident. In observing through a prism of Iceland
spar the light reflected to his windows from those of the palace of the Luxem-
bourg, he was surprised to see that, as he turned the prism around the ray, one
of the two images vanished at every quarter revolution. By following up the
indication thus given, he arrived at the important law that, when light is re-
flected from glass at an angle of 54° 35’, or from water at an angle of 52° 45/,
it possesses all the properties which belong to the pencils into which a ray of
ordinary light is divided by a doubly refracting crystal. Accordingly, if such
a crystal be placed in the path of such a reflected ray, with the principal plane
of the crystal, or a conjugate plane, in the plane of reflection, the ray will not
be doubly refracted. But if the crystal be turned in azimuth, two rays will
make their appearance, unequal at first in intensity, but becoming equal at the
azimuth of 45°. Beyond this azimuth the ray which was previously most in-
tense fades gradually away, while the other gains in strength, until, at 90°, the
former disappears entirely, and the latter remains alone. ‘Chese phenomenaare
repeated in every quadrant. .

If the ray which has been reflected as above described be incident upon a
second surface of glass, at the same angle, (54° 35/,) as at firsi, the plane of
second reflection corresponding with that of the first, it is in part reflected and
in part transmitted, as is the case with common light; but if the second plane of
reflection be at an azimuth of 90° with that of the first, no reflection at all will
occur, but the whole ray will be transmitted.

A ray of light therefore, which has undergone the modification which is pro-
duced by transmission through a doubly refracting crystal, or by reflection at an
incidence of 54° 35! from glass, or at that of 52° 45’ from water, seems to pos-
sess dissimilar physical properties on the sides which are at right angles to each
other, and similar ones on the sides which are diametrically opposed. This

* The important researches of Kirchhoff and Bunsen on the chemical relations of the fixec
lines of the spectrum have been published since the preparation of these lectures.

of many of the lines) in the atmosphere of the sun.
128 POLARIZATION OF LIGHT.

circumstance, from a sort of fanciful analogy which it presents with the relations
of the poles of the magnet, has suggested the name polarization, to distinguish
this condition of light.

An interesting experiment of Malus, illustrating the identity of the phenomena
of polarization by reflection, and polarization by double refraction, is the follow-
ing: Let a ray of light pass, at a perpendic ‘ular incidence, through a crystal of
Iceland spar, undergoing division into two rays; and afterwards ‘let these rays
fall at an incidence of 52° 45’ on water, or of 54° 35! on glass. Let then the
crystal be turned in azimuth until the principal section coincides with the plane
of reflection. The extraordinary ray will cease to be reflected altogether, though
the ordinary ray undergoes reflection as usual. Turning the erys stal once more
in azimuth, until the principal section is 90° from the plane of reflection, the
ordinary ray will, in its turn, wholly cease to be reflected, and the extraordinary
ray will revive.

Another interesting and very curious exper iment by Brewster, analogous to the
foregoing, may be performed thus: Let the light of a candle or other luminous
object be polarized by reflection, and afterward received, at the polarizing angle.
upon a plate of plane glass, which has its plane of reflection in azimuth 90°
from the plane of polarization. It will, as we have just seen, be wholly trans-
mitted, so that, to an eye placed anywhere in the direction in which reflection
would ordinarily occur, the radiant will be invisible. The. eye remaining in
thi- position, let now another person breathe upon the glass plate, and instantly
the luminous object will appear, and will continue to be seen until the film cf
moisture left by the breath has evaporated. This is because the polarizing
ang! for water is not the same as that for glass.

The eee may be varied and made still more striking by placing a
second plate by the side of the first, and adjusting this one to Y the polarizing
angl« for water. ‘The radiant will then be visible in the second plate, but not
in the first. In this state of things, if both plates be breathed on simulta-
neously, the light in the second plate will be extinguished and that in the first
revived by the same breath

It is only at che angles which have been mentioned that polarization by re-
flection is complete. But partial polarization takes place in reflection at any
angl-«; being zero at the incidences 0° and 90°, and. increasing from those inci-
dences up to the polarizing angle.

Light is polarized by reflection from all polished surfaces; but it is onl
the case of bodies whose indexes of refraction are in the neighborhood of 1.4
that the modification which it undergoes has the simplicity which belongs to the
examples we are considering. ~~ index of water is 1.336, and that of crown
glass 1.48 to 1.53.

It was the conclusion of Mules that the angle of polarization of a given body
is independent both of its refractive and of its dispersive power. Dr. Brewster.
however, demonstrated that this angie depends on the refractive power; and is
connected with it by the law that ‘the index of refraction of any body is the
tangent of the angle of polarization.”

From this law we derive one or two interesting consequences; first, at the
angle of polarization the reflected ray is perpendicular to the refracted ray, for,
putting ¢ for the angle of incidence, p for the angle of retraction, and » for the
index, the law of Snellius gives us zsine—sin:; and the law of Brewster, just
mentioned, gives n—tant. Hence—

tan: sino = sinp—sint; or, sine—cos:, and -+p==90°.

cose
Secondly, when light falls upon a transparent plate having parallel surfaces,
if the angle of incidence at the first surface is the polarizing angle, the angle of
incidence at the second surface will also be the polarizing angle for that surface

We have seen that when the two polarized rays into which a single ray of
common light is divided by double refraction in passing through a rhomb of
Iceland spar fall upon a second similar rhomb, they are both of them subdi-
vided in most of the positions of the second rhomb; but that the intensities of
the rays of each pair are unequal, except when the principal planes of the
rhombs differ in azimuth 45°, and that one member of each pair disappears en-
tirely when the principal planes are coincident or normal to each other. The
inequality of intensity is variable, and is dependent on the angle between the
principal planes. If one ray of either pair be observed through all its varia-
. tions, it will be found to begin from zero of intensity, to increase regularly in
brightness for 90°, and then to diminish through the second 90°, to zero again,
The other member of the same pair passes through a similar series of changes,
but its maxima correspond in azimuth to the minima of the first, and its minima
to the maxima of the first.

A ray which has been polarized by reflection possesses the same character
as those which have been produced by double refraction in Iceland spar; and
accordingly, if such a ray be transmitted through a doubly refracting rhomb
which is turned in azimuth in the manner just described, it will be divided into
‘two rays which will alternately increase and diminish in intensity; and of which
one will become zero in the azimuth 0° or 90° between its plane of polarization
and the principal section of the rhomb. Assuming the united intensities of the
two rays into which a single one is thus divided by double retraction to be equal
to the total intensity of the original ray, Malus inferred that their several inten~
sities should vary as the squares of the sines and the cosines of the azimuth.
Thus, if J be put for the total original intensity and a for the azimuth, reckoned
from the position of coincidence of the plane of polarization with the principal
section of the rhomb, then the ordinary ray would have the intensity J cos’a;
and the extraordinary, I'sin’a. ‘These values fulfil the condition of constancy
of sum; since—

Icos’a + Isin?a = I.

If a ray which has been polarized by reflection fall, at the polarizing angle,
upon a second mirror of transparent glass with parallel faces, it will be divided
into two rays; one of which will be reflected and the other transmitted. When
the second mirror is turned in azimuth around the incident ray, these two de-
rivative rays will undergo changes of intensity somewhat resembling those
which have just been described as produced by double refraction. When the
two planes of reflection are coincident, the intensity of the reflected ray will be
maximum, and that of the transmitted ray, minimum. This minimum will not,
however, be zero. When the two planes differ in azimuth 90°, the intensity of the
transmitted ray will be maximum, and that of the reflected ray, minimum.
This minimum wll be zero; and the simultaneous maximum of the transmitted
ray will be equal to the total intensity of the incident light. The alternations
in this case resemble, therefore, to a certain extent, those previously described
as produced by double refraction; but they are not represented by the law of
Malus.

The plane of polarization—an expression which we have just used without
defining it—is the plane in which a polarized ray is capable of being reflected
at the polarizing angle.. Accordingly, when a ray of common light is polarized
by reflection, the plane of incidence and reflection is itself the plane of polariza-
tion.

In the arrangement of two mirrors, as above described, when the second

s
.
13¢ POLARIZATION BY REFRACTION.

mirror is rotated in azimuth, its plane of incidence and reflection is constantly
changing its inclination to the plane of polarization of the ray incident upon it.
Suppose the incidence upon the second mirror zot to be at the polarizing angle.
It is found that after reflection in an oblique azimuth, the plane of polarization
is nearer to the plane of reflection than it was at incidence. If the azimuth at
incidence be represented by a, and that after reflection by a‘, there will be found
to be a constant ratio between tana and tana’; tana!’ being always less than
tanz. By many reflections, with the same azimuth between the mirrors,
the plane of polarization may be brought indefinitely near to the plane of re-
flection; but it can never be made, in this way, absolutely coincident with it.
When common light is reflected from any surface at an angle greater or less

. . . * a . . =) . .
than the polarizing angle it is found to be partially polarized: that is to say, it

is made up of a mixture of polarized light with common light. By repeated
reflections at the same incidence the polarization may be made sensibly com-
plete.- The number of reflections necessary for this purpose will be greater as
the angle of incidence is further from the polarizing angle.

Tt must not be overlooked that, though at the angle which we have called
the polarizing angle, all the light that is reflected is polarized, yet that this is
after all but a small portion of the incident light. From a single surface of
glass it amounts to less than eight per cent. The manner of determining this
ratio will be seen hereafter. When, for purposes of experiment, it is desired to
obtain a large and intense beam of polarized light, it has accordingly been found
useful to employ many reflecting plates placed one upon another, forming a
bundle or pile. It is obvious that the thinner these plates are made, (so that
they are not so thin as to produce color,) the more convenient they will be in
use, and, from the diminution of absorption, the more economical of light. Not
fewer than sixteen are usually employed.

The amount of light reflected at different angles of incidence goes on increas-
ing from 0° to 90°. The amount which is polar zed in the reflected beam also
goes on increasing, but not throughout the quadrant. For glass having the
index 1.5, the incidence of maximum polarization is 79°. At this incidence
the total intensity of the reflected light is expressed by the decimal 0.355, the
intensity of the incident light being 1. The amount which is polarized in the
reflected beam is, however, only 0.1518, which is still about double of that which
is reflected at the polarizing angle. But, comparing this value with the fore-
going 0.355, we shall see that it is less*than half the total light reflected, (forty-
four per cent.,) and accordingly it is not suited to exact experiments in polariza-
tion.

When a transparent reflector is employed as a polarizer the transmitted beam
will be found to contain light which is polarized in a plane perpendicular to the
plane of refraction. ‘The amount of light so polarized is exactly equal to the
amount polarized at the same time by reflection, and in the plane of reflection.
And as the maximum amount polarized by reflection from one surface of glass
having the index 1.5, is 0.1518, this also is the maximum amount which can be
polarized at one surface by refraction. But since, at this angle of maximum
polarization, the total reflection is only 0.355, the total transmission will be 0.645,
and of this amount the polarized portion will be but twenty-three and a half
per cent. But if this light, already partially polarized, be transmitted through
other refracting surfaces, though it will continually lose in total intensity by
reflection, it will gain in the proportion of the polarized light which it contains ;
and if the incidence is that of the polarizing angle for reflected light, the quan-
tity transmitted which is polarized, will continue to increase im absolute amount,
notwithstanding the decrease of total intensity, until polarized light only is trans-
mitted. Moreover, if the number of refracting plates employed should happen
to be greater than is necessary to produce complete polarization, the supernu-
merary plates will not reduce the amount of polarized light transmitted ; since,
at the incidence supposed, they are incapable of reflecting light polarized trans-
versely to the plane of reflection. This statement presumes, of course, that
NICOL’S PRISM. 1 =

the refracting surfaces are perfect, and that no light is lost by absorption in the
media.

It isa curious fact, resulting from the polarizing power of a pile of glass
plates, that the pile is more transparent when held at an obliquity greater than
the angle of polarization than it is at that angle; and that the transparency in-
creases with the obliquity. This is owing to the fact that the light which has
been polarized by the first few laminze undergoes very little loss by reflection
on increasing the obliquity; but the amount polarized in those first refractions
increases as the obliquity increases, more rapidly than the loss by reflection of
the natural light falling on the same surfaces is increased. The intensity of the
transmitted beam, therefore, becomes actually greater as the obliquity is greater:
a fact which is the reverse of what happens with a single plate.

A remarkable fact in regard to the condition of light emitted at great obli-
quities from luminous solids or liquids, was discovered by Mr. Arago. When-
ever the light of an incandescent body of either of these classes is examined as
it proceeds directly from the body and with no great inclination to the luminous
surface, it is found to be unpolarized. But when the rays whose obliquity to
the surface is very considerable are the subject of examination, they are found
to be partially polarized. The inference is, that these rays have been polarized
by refraction; and hence that they must have originated beneath the surface of
the luminous body. From the law of equality between the quantities of light
simultaneously polarized by refraction and by reflection, it follows that there
is areflection toward the interior of such bodies, of some of the light which
they generate. The light of flamés and incandescent gases exhibits no such
polarization.

The light of the sun is always unpolarized, whether it be examined at the
limb or at the centre of the disk. From ths observation, Arago was led to
consider the luminous envelope of the sun to be gaseous, and not liquid or solid.
An incidental corroboration of the ingenious suggestion of the elder Herschel
in regard to the constitution of the solar photosphere, is thus derived from
opties; and although that hypothesis is by no means universally received, and
though there seems recently to have been manifested an increasing disposition
among men of science to call it into question, it will be found difficult to recon-
cile the optical properties of the solar light with any supposition which implies
that the luminous-surface which we see is either liquid or solid.

In observations upon polarized light, there are some inconveniences attending
the use of a mirror, which, when turned in azimuth, obliges the observer to -
change his own position; or of a doubly refracting prism or erystal, which pre-
sents two images often not sufliciently separated. Both these disadvantages
are obviated by means of a prism invented by Mr. Nicol, which is now in

almost universal use. This contrivance is represented in

A _ FP -the figure. It is an elongated rhomb, formed of Iceland

i __ # spar, its length being about three times its breadth.
d a Having been brought into this shape from the natural
Fig. 14. crystal, it is carefully sawed asunder in the plane which

divides it symmetrically through its shortest diagonal,
AD, and then reunited by means of Canada balsam. This substance is per-
fectly transparent, and has a refracting power whose index is 1.532, interme-
diate between those of the ordinary and extraordinary rays, viz., 1.654 and 1.488.
The relative index between the crystal and the balsam for the ordinary ray is
1.0796, and the limiting angle of emergence from the former to the latter is 68°.
The ordinary ray from R meets the surface, AD, at a greater angle than this,
and is totally reflected at O. The extraordinary ray passes through. The
sides of the prism are blackened to prevent a second reflection.
This ingenious contrivance is invaluable to the observer in this interesting
branch of optical investigation. Its advantages are, however, in some respects
limited. ‘The necessary length of the prism, as compared with its lateral di-
132 POLARISCOPES.

mensions, renders it difficult to employ light of any considerable convergency
or divergency. ‘The cost of the construction of such prisms increases also
very rapidly with their magnitude; and few have been made at all which mea-
sured more than an inch on the side. Those commonly found with opticians
are much smaller than -this.

The eye-piece of Mr. Delezenne is a very good substitute for Nicol’s prism;
although it affords a less intensity of light. In this, the surface CD is a pol-
ished mirror of black glass; ABD is a prism of trans-
parent glass. Rv, Rr, rays of light falling at the pola-
rizing incidence upon CD, are reflected at a perpen-
dicular incidence upon the first surface of the glass
prism; and after being totally reflected on AB, emerge
at right angles to the surface AD, meeting the eye of
the observer at O.

Another convenient eye-piece, which may also serve, like Nicol’s prism, as a
polarizer for small beams, is formed of a lamina of tourmaline cut parallel to
the axis. This mineral possesses the very remarkable property, when not in
exceedingly thin lamine, of suppressing one of the rays into which incident
common light is divided by it, and transmitting the other. The ray transmitted,
as in Nicol’s prison, is the extraordinary ray. Cut perpendicularly to the axis
a plate of tourmaline is opaque. Two equal plates, cut parallel to the axis, are
opaque when crossed upon each other.

The disadvantages of the tourmaline eye-piece are, first, the color of the
erystal, which mars the beauty of the tints exhibited by polarized light, and to
some extent neutralizes them. It is rather unfortunate that the crystals which
are least colored are usually bad polarizers. In this respect different crystals
very much differ. Some, which are light green, transmit a notable amount of
the ordinary ray even when quite thick. Those which polarize best are usually
brown or yellowish brown. Occasionally one of this kind will be found which
polarizes well without being very disagreeably dark. But an equal if not
greater disadvantage of the tourmaline is the great brittleness of the crystal
and the rarity of specimens in which fissures do not naturally exist. It is
difficult, therefore, to obtain clear plates of any considerable size. Finally, the
supply seems, of late years, not to have kept pace with the demand; and op-
ticlans intimate that it is almost impossible to obtain specimens fit for optical
purposes at all.

A few years since Dr. Herapath, of London, announced the discovery of a
property like that of the tourmaline, in artificially prepared crystals of the iodo-
disulphate of quinine. These crystals are but slightly colored; and could they
easily be prepared and made permanent would probably come into general use.
Dr. Herapath succeeded in obtaining specimens half an inch across.

The peculiar property of the tourmaline was also early observed by Sir
David Brewster, in agate; but that substance is not sufficiently transparent for
the purposes of optical experiment.

When large polarizers are needed, resort must be had to reflection from mir-
rors made of black glass, which reflect only from the first surtace, or of trans-
parent glass whose surfaces are truly parallel. If great purity in the polarized
beam is not an object of importance, bundles of thin plates may be employed
as heretofore described, to polarize either by reflection or by refraction.

In the year 1811 Mr. Arago communicated to the Academy of Sciences of
Paris, one of the most remarkable and beautiful discoveries which has ever
been made in the history of optics. Upon examining thin plates of certain
transparent crystals, such as mica, selenite, or quartz, by means of transmitted
polarized light, he found that when the light was received upon the eye through
a prism formed of Iceland spar, the richest, conceivable colors made their ap-
pearance, which were complemertary to each other in the two images, and
which varied in intensity with the azimuth of the lamin or of the prism.

COLORS IN CRYSTALLINE PLATES. 133

When the principal plane of the prism coincides with the plane of polarization
of the light, and the azimuth of the lamina is varied, the maximum brillianey
of coloring is found in the azimuth of 45° between the principal section of the
lamina and the plane of polarization. When the azimuth is 0° or 90°, the
color entirely vanishes, and the light appears entirely unchanged. At inter-
mediate azimuths the color has an intermediate intensity, regularly increasing
and diminishing between the positions of minimum 2 eal maximum. ‘These
variations, as well as the thickness of the lamine themselves in which the phe-
nomena appeared, satisfied Mr. Arago that the colors could not be owing to the
same causes which produce the colors of Newton’s rings. Still they had evi-
dently some relation to the thickness; for it was not difficult to remove them
entirely, either by considerably increasing the thickness or by excessively
diminishing it. In the rotation of the lamina as just described, the colors
which appeared between the successive positions of minimum were always the
same in the same image. But when the lamina itself remained fixed, while the
prism at the eye was rotated in azimuth, the two images interchanged their
colors in passing each successive position of minimum.

Tf, instead of a doubly refracting prism as an eye-picce, a mirror, presented
to the ray at the polarizing angle, be employed, only one of the images is re-
flected; but the other, if the mirror be transparent, will be seen in the light
transmitted. In consequence of this separation of effects, Mr. Mec was led
to distinguish the mirror when used in this way as the analyzer. In observa-
tions with the analyzer, then, it appears that when the lamina is snguatel in azi-
muth, the same colors come and go in the successive quadrants; but when the
analyzer itself is rotated, the colors in the alternate quadrants are comple-
mentary to each other.

The colors thus seen in crystalline laminz recur in several successive series,
as the thickness of the laminz is increased. Accordingly, if in a plate of selo-
nite we hollow out a spherical cavity of very large radius, we shall find it to
exhibit several orders of rings resembling those of Newton, and following the

same laws; though the thicknesses at which the colors of the same order oceur
are very much ereater. According to the determinations of Biot, the compara-
tive thicknesses at which the same colors Epp w in air, in Iceland spar, in
quartz, in selenite, and in Siberian mica, are as the numbers 1, 13, 230, 230, and
440; the thickness for selenite and quartz being sensibly the same.
The limits of absolute thickness below which epg iias plates fail to give

colors in polarized light, are, for selenite, 0.017 in.; for mica, 0.0323 in.; and for
Iceland spar, 0.001 in. The maximum thickness for this last erystal is but six
or seven one-thousandths of an inch. Mica and selenite are therefore prepared
with facility for this class of chromatic experiments; but this is not equally
true of Iceland spar. If a lamina of selenite—a mineral which is very easily
wrought—be secured by transparent cement of any kind to a plate of glass,
very fanciful effects may be produced by grinding it away unequally in different
parts according to any definite pattern. Figures of various kinds, images of
insects, flowers, gothic windows, &c., &c., may thus be prepared, which will
come out in polarized light in very brilliant colors.

When laminz are presented obliquely to the polarized ray and the inclina-
tion varied, the colors change with the obliquity; sometimes ascending in order
with an increase and sometimes with a decrease of obliquity, according to the
character of the crystal and the direction in which the lamina has been taken
from it. For these experiments it is best to cut the laminze parallel to the
optic axes of the crystals.

If two lamine, either or both of which execed the limits at which colors are
seen, but whose d7fference of thickness is within those limits, be placed one upon
the other with their principal sections crossed—that is to say, placed at right
angles to each other—colors will be seen corresponding to those of single
134 CRYSTALS CUT ACROSS THE AXIS

lamince whose thicknesses are the differences of those employed in the experi-
ment. ‘This supposes that the lamine are of the same kind. If they are not,
the actual thicknesses are not to be employed in the calculations, but what may
be called the b:-refringent equivalents of thickness—that is to say, their measured
thicknesses divided by the numbers expressing their chromatic relation to th
plates of air which give Newton’s rings—which latter numbers may be called
their chromatic equivalents. If, then, the difference of these quotients, multi-
plied by the chromatic equivalent corresponding to the greater quotient, is
within the limits at which the crystal to which the greater quotient belongs
gives colors, the combination will give the color belonging to the value of that
product.

If the laminz belong to erystals of which one is positive and the other
negative, they are not to be crossed in this experiment, but their principal see-
tions must be parallel. This furnishes an easy test for determining whether a
given crystal/is positive or negative. Having prepared a lamina of the crystal
to be examined, (which may be of any convenient thickness,) apply it upon
lamin of Iceland spar of different thicknesses, with the principal sections sue-
cessively parallel and crossed. If the colors appear when the planes are parallel,
the signs are opposite, since, either plate being too thick to produce color alone,
the sum of their effects cannot, of course, do so. If the erystals are of similar
sign, the colors will appear when the planes are crossed.

Another class of chromatic effects produced by crystalline plates viewed in
polarized light was first observed by Dr. Wollaston in Iceland spar, in which
the display is, perhaps, the most brilliant. In these cases, the crystal is cut
perpendicularly across the axis. The arrangements for observation are the same
as in the experiments already described. If a mirror be employed as an
analyzer, and be turned to azimuth 90° before the introduction of the erystalline
plate, no light will, of course, be reflected to the eye. But the moment the
crystal is introduced a system of concentric rings will make its appearance,
colored with the richest conceivable tints, and marked by a black cross, whose
arms are in the plane of reflection, and at right angles to it, passing through the
centre.

Fig. 16. Bigs

The ends of these arms are enlarged, and have the appearance of brushes.
If the analyzer is transparent, another set of rings may be seen by the trans-
mitted light, in which the colors will be complementary to the former, and the
cross will be white. As the analyzing mirror is revolved in azimuth, the colors
fade and a new set of rings gradually appears with colors complementary to the
first, and distinguished by a white cross. In short, in this case, the colors before
transmitted are reflected, and those before reflected are transmitted. ‘The annexed
figures exhibit the two aspects of the rings which have been just described.
CRYSTALS OF QUARTZ ACROSS THE AXIS. 135

These rings make their appearance at thicknesses much greater than those
which produce color in laminz parallel to the axis.

In examining plates of quartz cut across the axis as above described, Mr.
Arago observed a peculiarity of a remarkable kind, which is seareely found in
any other natural crystal. The centre of the field was not dark in any position
of the analyzer, but was deeply and uniformly colored with a tint which varied
as the analyzer was turned. When a bi-refringent prism was employed as an
analyzer, the two images seen were constantly complementary in color, and as
the analyzer was turned they ascended in tint, in the order of Newton’s scale,
from red to violet. Mr. Biot, in subsequent experiments, discovered that in
some crystals the ascent of the tints in the scale is produced by a right-hand
rotation, (the ordinary direction of a screw,) and in others, by a left-hand rota-
tion. These classes of crystals have been distinguished by the names right-
handed and left-handed crystals, or dextrogyre and levogyre. Sir John Her-
schel, at a later period, made the remarkable observation that these optical
peculiarities of the crystals are associated with a geometrical or crystallographic
peculiarity. The tetrahedral angles where the prism and terminal pyramid
of the crystal meet, are sometimes replaced by planes which encroach more on
the neighboring planes of one side than on those of the other. The same
occasionally happens with the lateral edges of the crystal. These faces are
called plagihedral. If, as the crystal is held in the hand horizontally, with the
pyramidal vertex toward the observer, the plagihedral faces lean to the right—
that is, if they encroach most upon the faces to the right of them—the crystal
will be found to be optically dextrogyre, and the analyzer will have to be turned
in the direction of the movements of the hands of a watch, in order that the
tints may ascend.

Sir David Brewster’s observations on these
erystals led to the discovery that, when the
crystal is not very thick the uniformly tinted field
is confined to the centre, and is surrounded by
a system of rings resembling those seen in Ice-
land spar, but in which the cross is imperfect.
The figure exhibits the appearance. He also
found in that remarkable species of coloxed
quartz called amethyst, veins of right-handed and
left-handed crystallization alternating with each
other in many parallel layers, ana producing at
their surfaces of contact lines of neutral character.
In some specimens the layers were found to be

Fig. 18. so extremely thin as to neutralize the rotatory
power of the whole erystal, and in these instances the ordinary system of rings
with a perfect cross makes its appearance.

Tn all these observations upon crystals in the direction of their optic axes
the number of rings is greatly increased by the use of monochromatic light.
The intervals between the rings are also, in such light, intensely dark. In the
case of quartz crystals, monochromatic light presents appearances in the centre
very little different from those seen when the crystal is not present—that is to
say, it exhibits, as the analyzer is turned, a succession of maxima and minima,
separated from each other in azimuth 90°. But the absolute azimuths of these
maxima and minima are no longer what they were before the introduction of
the crystal: in other words, the plane of polarization has been turned to the
right or to the left, according to the nature of the crystal, through an angular
distance proportioned to the thickness of the crystal. The peculiar kind of
polarization produced by quartz has, on this account, been called rotatory
polarization.

136 AIRYS SPIRALS—FRESNEL’S PRISM.

Tt will be easily conceived that a right
handed and a left-handed crystal of equal
thickness, superposed upon each other,
will produce a resultant rotation equal to
zero. But two such plates so super-
posed, examined in polarized light, ex-
hibit a remarkable spiral cross, such as is
seen in the figure annexed. ‘These spi-

rals were first observed by Mr. Airy, and
are commonly known as Airy’s spirals.

Two contrary plates of wnequal thick-
ness, superposed as above, produce an
amount of rotation proportional to their
difference of thickness.

The power of rotation of the same

Fig 19 crystal is different for the different colors,
being, on the undulatory theory of light, an inverse function of the length of
the undulations." By employi ing the successive colors of the spectrum 1 sepa-

rately, Mr. Biot determined the absolute rotatory power of a crystalline plate of
quartz one twenty-fifth of an inch in thickness, for each, as follows :

oO e)

This property of rotatory polarization does not exist in plates of quartz cut
parallel to the axis. In such plates ordinary double refraction exists; but it is
the extraordinary instead of the ordinary ray whose velocity is least, or the
crystal is a positive one.

The physical cause of rotatory polarization is unknown. Mr. Biot supposed

it to belong to the ultimate molecules of the substance; but this hypothesis Sir
David Brewster believed to be disproved by the fact ‘that. the property ceases
to appear in quartz whose crystalline structure has been destroyed by fusion.
This argument seems, nevertheless, not to be conclusive. If the BIOBCEy. be-
longs to the ultimate molecules, the fact that it does not appear when the crys-
tals are examined across the axis, proves that a regular arrangement of them,
presenting their similar sides in a common direction, 1 is necessary for its display.
Fusion breaks up the regular arrangement, and thus destroys this essential
condition. ‘The fact, however, that different crystals turn the ray in different
directions, is apparently decisive against the hypothesis of Mr. Biot; and the
connexion of this difference of property with difference of ery stallographic mc di-
ficaiion,- seems to indicate that the phenomenon i is an effect of the structural
arrangement of the molecules. Indeed, it is observed, in.the fracture of quartz
crystals, that there is occasionally something actually resembling a spiral ar-
rangement of parts.

The double refraction,of quartz along its axis was experimentally analyzed
by Fresnel by means of a very ingenious arrangement. The difference of
velocity of the:two rays being so slight : as to render their separation by ordinary
cexpedients difficuli, he devised and constructed a caepead prism by which to
double their G@vergency. In the annexed figure, ABF and CDF represent
similar triangular prisms of right-handed quartz, with
the faces AB, CD, cut perpendicularly to the axis.
The obtuse-angled prism BID, having the angle
BED equal to the supplement of QAR B, has its
base, BD, parallel to the axis of a crystal of left-
handed quartz. The incident ray I’ falling per-
pendiculariy upon AB, is separated into two, whose

A a

CIRCULAR POLARIZATION—FRESNEL S RHOMB. 137

velocities differ, but which pursue the same path, which is the axis. At the
surface BF their paths become different, the velocity of one of them passing
from — to +, and that of the other from + to—. At the surface FD this
divergency is increased, the velocities again interchanging their relations. At
final emergence from the face CD, the diver gency ‘will be further slightly
increased in consequence of the inclination of the emergent rays to the surface.
By this arrangement a sufficient separation of the two.rays is obtained to make
it possible to examine them singly. And it is obvious that a duplication of the
system of prisms here shown, ora still greater increase in the number of ele-
ments employed, would, if necessary, make the separation still wider.

If quartz were like other uniaxial crystals in the law governing refraction
along its axis—that is, if the velocities of the two rays were in that direction
equal in this crystal as they are in others—the system of prisms just described
would produce no separation of the rays. 'The fact of the separation proves
quartz to be in this respect an exceptional case. When the separated rays are
examined, however, the extent to which quartz is exceptional is discovered to
be much greater than is implied in the difference just indicated. The peculiari-
ties are the following, and are true of either of the separated rays.

Examined with a doubly refracting prism, two perfectly equal images appear
in all azimuths of the prism. Received upon a mirror at the polarizing angle,
equal reflection takes place in all azimuths of the mirror. In these respects the
rays resemble ordinary unpolarized light.

But in the following particulars they differ: Transmitted through thin erys-
talline plates they display, on being analyzed, tints like those produced by
polarized light, only they are such tints as ordinary polarized light produces in
thicknesses of crystal greater or less, by a determinate amount, than those used
in the experiment.

Transmitted through a rhomb of glass, like that represented
in the figure, of which the acute dihedral angles are 544°, they
emerge, after two internal total reflections, at Q and P, polar-
ized in planes, one in azimuth 45° on the right, and the other
in azimuth 45° on the left, of the plane of reflection. If both
are transmitted through the rhomb simultaneously, so as to
emerge together, they will form a single ray polarized in the
plans of reflection.

Rays in this condition are said to be circularly polarized.
Fig. 21. And as it appears that a circularly polarized ray becomes plane
polarized by two internal reflections in glass, at an angle of incidence of 54° 30,
the resultant plane of polarization being inazimuth 45° from the plane of reflee-
tion, it follows that a plane polarized ray may be circularly polarized by caus-
ing it to make two similar reflections, the plane of its original polarization being
45° in azimuth from that of the first reflection. This is effected by the use of
arhomb such as has been just described, and which, from its originator, has
been called Fresnel’s rhomb. It is obvious that, ifa plane polarized ray be
thus passed through ¢wo of Fresnel’s rhombs successively, it will emerge plane
polarized.

Mr. Fresnel was led to the discovery of the remarkable property of the
thomb which bears his name, by theoretic considerations. When light is pass-
ing from a denser to a rarer medium, the angle of refraction is greater than the

co}
angle of incidence, and the law of Snellius,

gives a value for x, the index of refraction, less than unity. Now as 1 is the
greatest possible sine, if we put sino— 1, we shall have sinc—=z,; and there-
fore ¢ itself less than 90°. For an incidence greater than this value of « there

can be no emergent ray; and hence this is called the limiting angle. For all
incidences from ¢ to 90° the whole of the light is reflected; and this is what is
meant by total reflection at second surfaces.

Mr. Fresne! found that the mathematical formulz which he had deduced from
his theory of light, to express the intensity of reflection at different incidences, .
became ¢maginary in the case of total reflection; and in reasoning on the prob-
able causes of their failure, he was led to predict that a rhomb of glass, having
the angles above stated, would produce precisely the effect which has just been
described. Experiment proved the truth of this anticipation. The nature of
the modification which light undergoes in these circumstances will be more fully
explained further on.

Reflection from metals presents characters which resemble those of reflection
from the second surface of transparent media. There is this difference: that
common light ¢otal/y reflected exhibits no traces of polarization; but common
light reflected from metallic surfaces 7s partially polarized. When the incident
light at second surfaces is polarized in an azimuth between 0° and 90° the modi-
fications which it undergoes 1esemble those produced by metals. ‘This subject
was first systematically investigated by Sir David Brewster. He first discov-
ered that polarized light, after having unde:gone one total reflection in an azi-
muth between 0° and 90°, produced colors, when examined with an analyze.,
analogous to those produced by thin crystalline lamine. He afte: waids ascer-
tained that a polarized ray which has undergone successive reflections from
plane metallic mirrors placed parallel to each other, when the original azimuth
of reflection is 45° from the plane of polarization, will exhibit similar tints.
The angle of incidence at which the effect is best produced varies with different
metals, but is in all, or nearly all cases, above 70° and below 80°. The bright-
ness of the tints increases with the number of reflections.

Sir David B:ewster also found this analogy between the effects of such a pair
of parallel metallic mirrors and a pair of Kiesnel’s rhombs: that at a ce: tain
angle of incidence, different for different metals, the effect of the reflection on
the first mirror would be exactly compensated by that on the second, and the
ray would emerge plane polarized. But he found also this difference between the
eases: that while (the azimuth of incidence being + 45°) the ultimate plane of
polarization with the rhombs was — 45°, that with the metallic mirrors was
always less than this, being for silver, in which it was greatest, — 39° 48’, and
for galena, in which it was least, no more than — 2°. There is also this addi-
tional and very remarkable difference: In the case of the rhombs, after the
light has undergone reflection in the first, it will be restored to its original con-
dition by the second, no matter what be the azimuth between the planes of
reflection in the two rhombs. But in the case of the mirrors, if the second be
turned in azimuth, it will no longer restore the ray, unless the angle of incidence
be changed also. If it be turned quite round, the angle of incidence required
to effect restoration will pass through a series of regular variations between
determinate limits, which variations may be represented by the varying radii of
an elfipse. It was on this account that the term e//iptical polarization was
originally applied to light in this physical condition. We shall see, further on,
that the propriety of the term may be established on other grounds.

Common light reflected from metallic surfaces is more or less elliptically
polarized. In fact, the recent investigations of Mr. Jamin and others have
proved that there are very few substances which furnish by reflection from their
surfaces absolutely pure plane polarized light. None are capable of doing so
whose indexes ‘of refraction exceed or fall short of 1.414. Water and glass do
so sensibly; but in this respect they are nearly exceptional.
CRYSTALS OF TWO AXES. 139

The rings seen in, crystals cut across the
axis, when examined in circularly polarized
light, exhibit some singular peculiaritics.
They are divided into quadrants by a cross
which is neither very dark nor very bright,
and which does not change in intensity with

lit.’ The rings in the alternate quadrants are
unconformable, those in one opposite pair
being nearer to the centre, and those in the
other more distant from the centre, by a
quarter of an interval, than the corresponding
rings in plane polarized light. This singular
arrangement is shown in Fig. 22.

Mr. Airy found that light may be circu-
larly polarized by refraction, in passing
through Jamine of erystals which doubly refract; provided the thickness of the
laminz used is such as, on the undulatory theory of light, is just sufficient to
effect a.rctardation of one of the rays produced by the double refraction, one-
quarter of an undulation behind the other, or to advance it one-quarter of an
undulation before the other. The mineral employed by him for this purpose,
and which is more conveniently prepared of suitable thickness than most others,
is mica; of which the lamin are easily separable, and cleave in large sheets
without breaking. A lamina reduced to a thickness proper to produce circular
polarization is commonly called a “ quarter-wave lamina.”

For some time after the discoveries had been made of which a brief account
has here been given, it was supposed that all doubly refracting crystals have
but a single optic axis. In the year 1817, however, Sir David Brewster
announced the remarkable fact that most crystals have two optic axes instead
of one. The rings seen in crystals of two axes are elliptical, when the axes are
so far apart that only one can be observed at a time; and thcy form lemniscate
curves, or curves resembling the figure 8, when they are near together. In topaz

Fig. 24.

the axes form an angle with each other of 65°, and the rings present the appear-
ance shown in Fig. 23, when the analyzer is crossed upon the polarizer, the
plane of the axes of the crystal being in azimuth 0° or 90°. This erystal pos-
sesses the peculiarity of showing its own rings without the help of an analyzer
when the plate subjected to experiment is cut across the line intermediate
between the axes, the opposite surfaces being parallel. In such a plate, in order
that the ray may follow the line of one of the axes within the erystal, its angle
of incidence must be 624°. The angle of refraction will then be 32$°. The
incident angle at either the first or the second surface will, therefore, be ver
nearly equal to the polarizing angle for the substance, since the reflected and
refracted rays make an angle of 85° with each other; whereas, according to
the law of Brewster, at the polarizing angle they should be at right angles.
If, therefore, instead of observing the light transmitted through the plate, we
140. POLARIZING STRUCTURE ARTIFICIALLY PRODUCED.

veeeive upon the eye the rays reflected from the second surface and emergent
from the first, the reflecting surface itself forms an analyzer sufficiently perfect
to exhibit the rings. But as the angle of reflection is not truly the polarizing
angle, when the crystal is in azimuth 90° the dark band will not be as large as
is the case in the rings seen with a better analyzer by transmitted light. Fig.
24 exhibits the appearance of these reflected rings.

In Figs. 25 and 26, which follow, are seen the appearances presented when
the subject of examination is saltpetre, (nitrate of potash,) in which the axes
are inclined to each other 6°. The plane of the axes of the crystal being brought

Hig. 26,

into coincidence with the plane of polarization of the incident light, and the
analyzer being crossed upon the polarizer, a system of lemniscate curves is
seen, like that shown in Fig. 25, intersected by a dark cross, of which the bar
coinciding in direction with the plane of the axes is longest. If the analyzer
be turned 90°, the colors become complementary, and the cross becomes white;
but if, the analyzer and polarizer remaining fixed, the crystal itself is turned in
azimuth, the cross will break at the centre, forming two curves, which, when
the rotation becomes forty-five degrees, assume the form of two opposite hyper-
bolas. ‘This appearance is exhibited in Fig. 26.

In the prosecution of his investigations, Sir David Brewster arrived at the
discovery that the polarizing structure could be artificially produced in glass by
heat or by rapid cooling; that this effect is transient when the heat is below
the point of softening or fusing the substance; but that when it is carried beyond
that point, and cooling rapidly follows, as in glass which is not annealed, the
structure is permanent. He found that the same structure could be produced
by pressure, by torsion, by tension, or by flexure; and traced the transient con-
dition of the same kind produced by heat to the mechanical effects of unequal
expansion. Any solid transparent substance, organic or mineral, was found by
him to be capable of receiving this structure transiently or permanently. Among
these may be named horn, indurated jellies, tortoise shell, gums, resins, the
crystalline lenses of fishes or animals, &c., &c.

When cylinders, tubes, rhombs, or other geometrical forms of well-annealed
glass are subjected to a sudden increase of temperature acting upon all their sur-
face, as by immersing them in hot water or hot oil, there will be seen within
them, by polarized light, systems of symmetrical figures, circular and concentric
in cylinders, and dependent on the form of the solid for their shape in other cases,
bearing a striking resemblance to the rings seen in crystals. Like those rings,

co)
these figures are marked by a cross, which changes from black to white with
-ROTATORY POLARIZATION OF LIQUIDS. 14]

the rotation of the analyzer. But these figures will alter their forms if the glass
be broken, which is not true of the rings formed in crystal. When the heat
has fully penetrated the glass, and the interior temperature is uniform, the
figures cease to be seen. At this time, if the heated glass be removed from the
bath, and allowed to cool rapidly, a new system of figures will spring up within
it. This is related to the former one, as the rings of a positive erystal are to
those of a negative one; and, therefore, if two similar solids, in one of which
the former set of figures is seen, and in the other the latter, be superposed when
the intensities are equal, they will neutralize each other’s effects, and the rings
will disappear. ‘This structure may be made permanent in the glass solids we
have been considering by heating them nearly to the point of fusion and then
suddenly cooling them. Many common articles of glass are so imperfectly an-
nealed as to display the doubly refracting structure in a striking manner. The
stoppers of bottles, if cut across the axis and polished, will invariably show it;
so will the stems of wine glasses, the stirring-rods of the chemist’s laboratory,
and many, if not all, glass tubes.

The effects of heat are also remarkable in altering the doubly refracting
character of crystals. Mr. Mitscherlich discovered that heat expands crystals
unequally in different directions. Iceland spar is expanded in the direction
of its axis, and slightly contracted at right angles to the axis. Its doubly re-
fracting power is thus diminished. In sulphate of lime, which is a crystal of
two axes inclined to each other 60°, he found that the inclination diminishes
with elevation of temperature, until the two axes unite in one; after which,
with further increase of heat, they open out ina plane at right angles to the
first. Dr. Brewster discovered an example even more remarkable in glauberite.
At the freezing point, this crystal has two optic axes for every color of the
spectrum, the inclination of the axes of the red being greatest, and that of the
violet being least. At ordinary temperatures it has two axes for red and one
for violet. When heat is applied, the other axes approach, as in the case just
described, and, after successively uniting, successively open out in the transverse
plane.

In comparing the erystals which possess the power of double refraction, (being
by far the greater number of the whole,) there is found to be a certain relation
between the optical character of the crystal and the erystallographic structure.
All crystals whose primitive form is the cube, the regular octahedron, or the
rhomboidal dodecahedron—figures whose geometrical axes are all equal—are des-
titute of the property. All crystals which have one axis greater or less than the
others are crystals of one optic axis. All crystals whose geometric axes are all
three unequal have two axes of double refraction.

In the year 1815, Mr. Biot made the remarkable discovery that many liquids
possess the power of rotatory polarization—a discovery which was independently
made by Mr. Seebeck ; the effect was first observed in oil of turpentine, but has
since been found in most essential oils, in solutions of sugar, dextrine, the vege-
table alkaloids, camphorie and tartaric acid, and the tartrates. In some of these
substances the plane of polarization is turned to the right and in others to the
left. Their relative rotatory forces are estimated by a comparison of the amount of
angular change in azimuth produced upon a polarized ray in passing through a
column of given length; but as yet there has been no universal agreement upon
astandard length. ‘The statements of experimenters, therefore, usually-embrace
both the angular rotation and the length of the column by which it has been
produced, rendering a reduction to a common length necessary before a correct
comparison can be instituted. It would perhaps be most convenient to adopt
as a standard length, the length of the tube introduced by Mr. Soleil into his
saccharimeter, or instrument for measuring the rotation in solutions of sugar,
which is twenty centimetres. With this length the dextro-gyration of the oil
of bitter oranges is, for red light, 157°.89, which is the maximum observed in
142 HEMIHEDRISM——-THE TARTRATES.

this class of’ liquids. The laevo-gyration of narcotine, in alcohol and ether, is
151°.4; that of sulphate of quinine, in water acidtlated with sulphuric acid, is
192°.95 in the same direction. Solution of crystallizable cane sugar is dextrogyre ;
that of uncrystallizable cane sugar, or molasses, is levogyre. Solution of sugar
of grapes is also dextrogyre when prepared from the juice, and before solidifica-
tion; but if evaporated to dryness and redissolved, it is hevogyre. Crystallizable
cane sugar is made unerystallizable by heat, and its rotatory power is accordingly
reversed by the same cause. In many solutions the introduction of an acid
modifies the rotatory power. Narcotine, from being —151°.4, becomes, after the
addition of hydrochloric acid, +83°. Cane sugar has its rotatory power inverted
in the same way. Upon this principle is founded the construction of Soleil’s
saccharimeter just mentioned. A solution of the sugar to be examined is made
of a definite density, and its rotatory power observed in a tube twenty centimetres
in length. There is then added to the solution a measured amount, one-tenth
of its volume, of strong hydrochloric acid, and a heat of about 150° F., applied
for ten minutes; after which it is cooled and observed again in a tube one-tenth
longer than before. Its rotation will now be wholly negative. The original
observation will give the difference between the rotatory effects of*the erystal-
lizable and unerystallizable sugar present, and the second observation will give
the sum of the same effects. From these data the relative quantities of the
two kinds contained in the solution may be deduced. For convenience, tables
to accompany the instrument are prepared in advance, from which the values
sought may be found by inspection. A saccharimeter has also been contrived
by Mr. Mitscherlich.

Mr. Pasteur has made a very elaborate examination of the salts of tartaric
and paratartaric acid in their relations to polarized light. All the tartrates are
dextrogyre; the paratartrates have no rotatory power at all. Myr. Pasteur made
the interesting discovery that paratartarie acid which is the same as racemic, and
which differs from tartaric acid only in having an additional atom of water, is
composed of two acids, one of which has a positive and the other a negative rota-
tory power. The dextro-racemic acid is simply tartaric acid, and the dextro-race-
mates are tartrates. Paratartaric acid and its salts owe their neutral character
to the balance of opposite forces belonging to their components.

In considering the crystalline forms of these different salts, Mr. Pasteur de-
tected a relation between them and their polarizing properties, such as has already
been described to exist in quartz; that is to say, the salts which possess rota-
tory power have plagihedral faces leaning in the direction of rotation. The
crystals are all of the kind called by Mr. Weiss hemihedral ; that is to say, not
in all respects symmetrical. Mr. Pasteur observed that there are two kinds
of hemihedral crystals, which he has distinguished as the superposable and the
non-superposable. When a crystal, or any solid, or surface is such that another
may be conceived or constructed like it in every particular as to form and dimen-
sions, yet incapable of being made to oceupy the same matrix or mould, such a
crystal, or solid, or surface belongs to the class of the non-superposable. 'The
image of the face in a mirror, as compared with the face itself; the left hand or
the left foot, as compared with the right, and many analogous objects natural and
artificial, may serve to illustrate this conception. Mr. Pasteur found that all the
crystals whose salts possess the rotatory power are hemihedral and non-super-
posable; and, conversely, that all salts whose erystals are non-superposably
hemihedral have the power of circular polarization, with two exceptions only
thus far known, which are formiate of strontian and sulphate of magnesia. In
the latter case the crystal is so very nearly superposable, that it is hardly sur-
prising that it should not sensibly conform to the law. In the instance of the
formiate of strontian, Mr. Pasteur thinks that the hemihedrism does not depend
on the arrangement of atoms in the chemical molecule but on that of the physi-
cal molecules in the entire crystal; so that, on solution, the structure on which
ATMOSPHERIC POLARIZATION. 143

the rotatory power depends, disappears in the same manner as it is known to do
in quartz on fusion. It is impossible within the limits to which we are here
confined to pursue this interesting subject further.

Mr. Arago early made the discovery that the light which comes to us from
the atmosphere is polarized. Observations made in the vertical plane passing
through the sun show sensible polarization in that plane up to about 150° from
the luminary—a point which can only be observed, therefore, when the sun is
low. The polarization at this point becomes. zero, and it is hence known as
Arago’s veutral point. Below this point down to the horizon, polarization is
found in a horizontal plane. Mr. Babinet discovered a second neutral point 17°
above the sun, and Dr. Brewster a third, 8° 30’ below. Neither of these is
easy of observation. in consequence of the proximity of the sun himself and his
ereat light. Between them the light is probably polarized horizontally; but the
fact, for the reason just mentioned, has not been verified. The plane of polar-
ization in the vertieal between the neutral points of Arago and Babinet is easily
accounted for by ascribing the polarization itself to direct reflection of the sun’s
rays from the molecules of. the atmosphere. The polarization in a horizontal plane
below Arago’s point is a less simple phenomenon. It is believed, however, to
be occasioned by rays which have undergone two reflections from the atmos-
pheric molecules. Of the rays of this class those which will come most effectively
to the eye of the observer will be such as are reflected in the lower parts of the
atmosphere in planes nearly parallel to the horizon. These will, of course, be
polarized in planes nearly horizontal, and if in force sufficient to overcome the
light polarized vertically, will produce a resultant in their own direction. At
an altitude at which the two opposite polarizations balance each other, will be
found a neutral point, and this is the point of Arago.

Regarding atmospheric reflection of the sun’s rays as the cause of atmospheric
polarization, it will follow that every plane passing through the sun (in the
superior portions of the atmosphere at least) must be a plane of polarization.
This will therefore be true of the howr-circle or meridian in which the sun
happens at any time to be. And as all hour-cireles pass through the pole of the
heavens, it results that a delicate polariscope, directed toward the pole, may
follow the horary motion of this plane. Such a polariscope, furnished with a
dial and index, becomes a chronometer. This is the principle of an elegant
little instrument invented by Wheatstone, called the polar clock. When aceu-
rately adjusted, it will indicate, in the hands of a practiced observer, the
apparent solar time within a very few minutes. It will operate even when the
sky is overeast with clouds, provided there be an unobscured spot at the pole,
through which the blue sky may be seen.

In the foregoing very suceinct outline of the history of optical discovery; the
object kept in view has been to present simply facts, without entering into any
discussion of the physical causes to which they are to be attributed. It is now
proposed to consider in what manner these facts may be most satisfactorily
explained.

THEORIES OF0 LIGHT.

Two theories have been maintained in regard to the nature of light, either of
which is supported by the authority of very illustrious names. According to
the first of these, light is a material emanation thrown off by the luminous body,
and its particles constantly traverse and fill the entire illuminated space, so long
as the source continues unexhausted. According to the second, there is no
transfer of matter from the source of light to the surrounding region, but there
is a transfer of force through the medium of an elastic fluid which fills all space,
and whose molecules in contact with the luminous body, being disturbed by that
body, transmit the disturbance to those more remote, by means of undulations
144 MATERIAL THEORY OF LIGHT.

which succeed each other uninterruptedly until the cause which produced them
ceases to act. The first of these two hypotheses seems to have been of very
early origin. It received the sanction of Newton, and was made by him the
basis of his reasonings in regard to optical phenomena. It is hence commonly
called the Newtonian theory. Until an advanced period in the present century
it may be said to have been the generally accepted theory. Laplace, in his
great work on celestial mechanics, has founded all his investigations in regard
to aberration and astronomical refraction upon it.

Yet it must be admitted by its advocates, if there remain any who adhere to
it still, that it presents, even before we follow it into its applications to the ex-
planation of the phenomena we have described, many serious difficulties. In
the first place, if light consist of material particles, these particles must be of
inconceivable minuteness, or their living force would be sufficient to destroy
every structure, no matter how solid or how tenacious it might be, which they
should encounter in their flight. A single grain of matter, moving with the
velocity of light, would have a quantity of motion equal to that of a cannon ball
of 100 pounds weight, moving with the velocity of 1,500 feet per second. But
since destructive power is proportioned, not to the quantity of motion, but to
the living force, which varies as the square of the velocity, a single grain of
matter moving with the velocity of light would have a destructive power equal
to that of a mass of 3,350 tons moving with the velocity of 1,500 feet. If light
be material, therefore, its particles must be many millions of times less in
weight than a single grain. We have no instruments sufficiently delicate to
detect a weight so minute. Still it would be possible, by optical arrangements,
to concentrate many millions of particles upon a single point. Attempts have
been made to test the question by the use of such expedients. Dr. Priestley, in
his History of Light and Colors, deseribes an experiment in which he directed
the light of the sun, by means of a concave mirror having four square feet of
surface, upon a balance of exceeding delicacy, without producing any sensible
impression. The conclusion is expressed in his own words, as follows: “ Now
the light in the above experiment was collected from a surface of four square
feet, which, reflecting only about half what falls on it, the quantity of matter
contained in the rays of the sun incident upon a square foot and a half of sur-
face in one second of time, ought to be no more than the twelve hundred millionth
part of a grain.”

Dr. Priestley does not consider that, in such an experiment, it is the moment,
and not the weight, of the particles of light that would be measured. The
amount of inertia in any balance, however delicate, is sufficient to render it an
instrument not very well adapted to the purpose in view. The presence of the
air is also a disadvantage, both on account of its own resistance to motion and
on account of the currents created by the heat which attends the direction of
the solar focus upon any solid. 'The following experiment by Mr. Bennet avoids
these objections. This brief account is taken from Professor Lloyd’s Essay
on the Undulatory Theory, edition of 1857. ‘A slender straw was suspended
horizontally by means of a single fibre of the spider’s thread. 'To one end of
this delicately suspended lever was attached a small piece of white paper, and
the whole was enclosed within a glass vessel from which the air was withdrawn
by the air-pump. The sun’s rays were then concentrated by means of a large
lens, and suffered to fall upon the paper, but without any perceptible effect.”
These results are negative, it is true, but it must be admitted that they are such
as to render the truth of the material theory of light in the highest degree
improbable.

Another difficulty in the way of this theory is found in the uniformity of
velocity with which light reaches us from distances all but infinitely unequal,
and from luminous bodies of every magnitude. This equality of velocity in the
propagation of the light of the stars is evinced in the universality of the law of
THEORY OF EMISSION—DIFFICULTIES. 145

aberration. But it might be inferred from the equality of the refraction which
all light, whether natural or artificial, undergoes in passing from medium to
online Now, if light be material, it must te regarded as subject, like all other
projectiles, to retar dation by the gravitating power of the way from which it is
emitted. And, moreover, it is a phenomenon inconceivable that so perpetual a
shower of projectiles, so infinite in number, should all be thrown with the same
initial velocity, and that this initial velocity should be the same for every source.
The only hypothesis upon which it is possible to meet this last objection is to
assume, according to a suggestion of Mr. Arago, that the eye is insensible to
luminous impressions, except for a certain definite velocity of the luminiferous
particles, or for that narrow range of variation of velocity, within which are
embraced the velocities which we attribute to the different colors in refracting
media.

In regard to the retardation of the particles by the attracting power of the

luminous body itself, it may be observed that, with our present means of
measurement, this would not be appreciable for distances so small as that which
separates us from the sun, or even for distances no greater than the extreme
dimensions of the solar system; at least without supposing an enormous increase
in the mass of the luminous body beyend that of any aggregated form of matter
known to us. An attracting body can destroy, in a projectile thrown from it,
no greater an amount of velocity than it can impart to a material mass falling
toward it. And this limit is reached if we suppose the falling body to commence
its motion at an infinite distance. Now, the velocity acquired by a body falling
from an infinite distance to the sun’s surface, under the influence of solar at-
traction, would be less than four hundred miles (391 miles) per second; and of
this velocity about fourteen-fifteenths (365.1 miles) would be acquired after
passing the limit of the earth’s orbit. But the body would be twenty-seven
and a half days in reaching the sun after passing this limit, while light is only
eight minutes and thirteen seconds in traversing the same immense space. The
effect of an accelerating or retarding force being as its time of action, and, in
this case, the two times to be compared being in “the ratio of about one to four
hundred and eighty, it may easily be shown that the retardation of light by
solar attraction, during its transit from the sun to the earth, could not be so
much as a mile per second in its velocity.

But the light of stars coming from distances so vast as to require years, and
many years, to reach us, must undergo such retardation as to render aberra-
tion a phenomenon exceedingly variable, unless we admit Mr. Arago’s assump-
tion just mentioned in regard to the sensibility of the retina. Moreover, in
cases in which the rays, in their long travel, had becbme reduced to velocities

paratively moderate, the gravitating power of heavy bodies near which they
mit pass, ought to produce : a aeasible: deflection of their course, and. modify, in

a remarkable manner, the phenomena of occultations. Nothing of this kind is
observed. It is here assumed that there may be suns much more massive than ours.

Laplace has examined the question, what ought to be the mass of a luminous
body, in order that its gravitating power may be great enough to destr roy the
velocity of the particles “of light entirely, at some distance less than infinite—
the initial velocity being assumed to be that which observation has determined
in the sunlight as it reaches us. ‘The expression for the velocity acquired in
falling from an infinite distance to the sun’s surface—his mass being assumed
to be unaltered, is—

of the sun, both expressed in feet. If we put v == 192,700 miles, (reduced to
feet,) and make m indeterminate, we shall find that the mass must be increased
860,000,000,000 fold to be capable of creating, and therefore of destroying, a
velocity equal to that of light. 'This supposes the bulk of the sun to be un-
altered. But if she mass is increased without altering the density we shall
have—

Replacing the symbols by their values, we find that the sun must be enlarged
to nearly five hundred times his present diameter in order to possess the power
of entirely arresting the progress of light, considered as material, at any distance.
The surface of such a sun would extend more than seventy millions of miles
beyond the orbit of Mars. That there may be bodies in the universe so large
as this is possible, but we may esteem it hardly probable. If there are, and if
light is material, they may be invisible to us.

A final objection to the material theory of light is found in the phenomena of
refraction and reflection. This, though it seems to have been overlooked, is
really the most serious of all. We have seen that the effect of the immense
power of solar gravitation is insufficient to produce more than an inappreciable
variation in the velocity of light, during the nearly eight minutes and a quarter
which is occupied in its passage over the space between us and the sun; and
yet, if the hypothesis we are considering be true, there is a force residing in the
superficial stratum of transparent bodies—a stratum so thin that no attempt has
ever been made, or can be made, to measure it—which is capable of instantane-
ously doubling and, in some instances, almost tripling this velocity. Thus
light which has passed the surface of glass of antimony or chromate of lead
must, if this theory is true, have its velocity raised, in the instant of passing,
from 192,700 miles to 574,000 miles per second. In common glass the velocity
becomes 289,000 miles. In ordinary reflection, also, the reflecting force has
first to destroy the original velocity, and then to impart an equal velocity in
the opposite direction. This is more easily conceivable than the acceleration
produced by refraction, as it corresponds with the ordinary phenomena of elas-
ticity. But refraction, on the theory we are considering, is only explicable on
the hypothesis of attraction; and the immensity of an attracting force which is
capable of accomplishing in so short a time what gravity is totally unequg] to
in a time greater beyond measure, is totally inconceivable.

But, if objections of this weighty description to the material theory of light
did not exist, the impossibility of finding in it any satisfactory explanation of
the remarkable phenomena which have presented themselves in the later pro-
gress of optical discovery, would be conclusive against it; while the opposing
theory finds in these very phenomena its strongest recommendation to accept-
ance. It is to that theory, therefore, that attention will be confined in the fol-
lowing attempt to conncet the facts which have been detailed with their proba-
ble causés. ‘To repeat the imperfect explanations which have been founded on
a hypothesis which is now generally abandoned, would be an unprofitable waste
of time and space.
THEORY OF UNDULATION—VIBRATION. OE

PART Hf.

UNDULATO:EY THE OR Y.

§ I. VIBRATION.

In order to understand the mode in which undulations are propagated through
an elastic medium, it is necessary to attend first to the subject of vibration. If
a body be so held in equilibrium between opposing forces, as that, when dis-
placed from its position of repose, it is urged to return by a force always pro-
portional to its distance from that point, then the time occupied in returning,
supposing it to be left at liberty to obey this impulse, will be the same, what-
ever may be the magnitude of the displacement. Moreover, if the extent or
amplitude of the displacement be taken as a radius, and a circle described about
the point of repose as a centre, the velocity of the body in its returning move-
ment will be proportional, at every point of its path, to the per-
pendicular to the path drawn from that point and cut off by the
circular are. Thus, if C be the point of repose, and CA the
amplitude of displacement, the force urging the body to return
being proportional to CA, CI’, CH, &e., when the body is at the
: points A, I’, and H, then the velocities at these several points will

Fig 27. be proportional to zero at A, to EF at F, and to GH at H.
These elementary propositions in physics, which admit of easy demonstration,*

*The demonstration referred to is the following: Put CA—a, CH=z. Put also ¢ for the
time from the beginning of movement, v for the velocity, and p? for the force drawing the body
toward C at the distance umty. Then if dx be the small space described in the small time
dt, vrdt—=—dz ; dx being negative because, when v is increasing, it diminishes z.

Also, if dv be the small increase of velocity in the time dt, we shall have the force, at the
distance z, equal to p*z, and p*adt=dv. Whence,

vdv =— p*zdx; and v7? =— p*2? + C.
But when v= 0, =a: consequently,
v= p(a?—zx2); or, v= pV a?—x?=(in the figure) pV CR — CH? =p.GH.

Therefore v is proportional to GH. Also, the time of vibration is constant, irrespective of
the value of a. For, substituting in the first equation the value of » just found,

may be assumed as established. When the body in its return arrives at C, it
will accordingly be moving with the velocity represented by CD, the radius of
the circle, and its inertia will carry it forward in the direction CB. It will now
be resisted by forces similar in degree but contrary in direction to those which
urged it from A to C, and its velocity will decrease as it before increased, until
it is brought to rest again at B, when it will once more return. Supposing no
forces or resistances to be called into action but those embraced in our hypothesis,
there is no reason why this reciprocating motion should not continue indefinitely.

We have an approximate illustration of the case under consideration in an
ordinary pendulum. When the pendulum is drawn from the vertical position,
the component of gravity which urges its return is a force very nearly propor-
tional, at every instant, to its distance from the position of rest. Were its path
a cycloidal instead of a circular are, this proportionality would be rigorously
exact. Its beats are therefore sensibly equal in time, whether it swing through
twenty degrees or through only one.

If we suppose the pendulum to be so suspended that its vibrations are not of
necessity restricted to a single plane, we shall be able to conceive, without much
difficulty, what must happen in another case important to be considered, viz:
that in which a body, already in a state of vibration, is acted upon by a second
disturbing force, not directed in the same plane with the first. To simplify the
‘supposition as much as possible, let us imagine that, at the moment when the
body, in its return from A, is passing the centre C, it receives an impulse in the
direction D, at right angles to its actual movement, capable of giving it, in-
stantaneously, the same velocity towards D, which it already has towards B.

By the law of the composition of forces, it will take the direc-
R_2—_ tion CM, which is the diagonal of the rectangle formed upon
CB, CD; and its subsequent vibrations will be represented in
= RB extent and direction by the lime NM. It will be seen that the
yo” extent of its excursions in the direction AB remains unaltered,
PO since the lines MB and AN are parallel ; but it performs, at the
same time, an equal vibration in the direction DP, since DM

eae and NP are also parallel.

Let us suppose, however, that the second impulse takes effect on the body
not at the point C, of its greatest velocity, but at A, where its motion is null,
and at the instant when it is about setting out on its return to C. It will
vibrate, as before, between the parallels NP and MDR; ‘but it will reach the
limits of its vibration in this direction when it is at the middle of the vibration
in the other. At the end of half a vibration, therefore, it will be found at D
instead of at C, as in the former case; at the end of the next half at B; at the
end of the third half at P; and at the end of the fourth, or of a complete double
vibration, at A, the point of starting. Apparently, therefore, under these cir-
cumstances, the orbit of the body is a circle. We shall see that this is really so.

In fact, if we represent by 7 the radius vector of the body, and by
x and y its co-ordinates to the axes AB and DP, we shall have the
equation 2?+7?==7*. Whence, taking the differential—

zdx+ydy =rdr. (a)

method, a little further on in the text, in regard to the measure of the time elapsed since the
beginning of the vibration, at any given moment, and in any position of the vibrating body.

Since t varies as cos_ . it is obvious that, if a circle be described on the path of the vibra-
a
ting body as a diameter, and if an ordinate to the circumference be drawn from the position
of the vibrating body at any moment, the are of the circle intercepted between the origin and
this ordinate will be the measure of the time elapsed since the vibration began. The are must
be taken always in the same constant direction around the circumference, and the ordinate
must be positive for the advancing and negative for the returning movement. In like man-
ner, the are intercepted between two such ordinates, will measure the time intervening between
the moments when the vibrating body occupied the points from which the ordinates are drawn.
VIBRATION. 149

Now, by the law of velocities above given, if @ be put for the maximum ve-
locity, or that which the body has in passing ©, and if ¢ be put for the are of
the circle on AB which is included between the origin, oe and y, the velocity
in the direction AB, will be asing; and that in the direction CD, acos¢.
Hence, for the differentials of the co-ordinates x and y, we have, putting ¢ for
the time—

dx—=—asingdt; and dy = acose¢dt.

But by construction z—=rcos¢g, and y=rsing.
Substituting these values in equation (a) there results—

— arsingcosgdt+ arsingcosgdt = rdr.

dr
Or, — =0.
dt
From which it appears that the radius vector is constant and the orbit a circle.
Also the motion in the circle is uniform. For if dg be the increment of the
are,
dg? = dx’ + dy’.

i

And substituting the values of dx and dy, given above, we have,
dg’? =a’ sin*¢dt? + a’cos*ed? =a'dt’.

And en
dt

That is to say, the velocity of the movement in the circle will be uniform, and
will be equal to the maximum velocity of the plane vibration.

Hence it follows that if, at the moment when a body, vibrating in a recti-
linear path, is at the limit of its movement, a second body sets out from the same
point, in a circle of which the path of the first is a diameter, with a uniform ve-
locity equal to the maximum velocity of the first, the line which joins the two
will move parallel to itself, and will always be perpendicular to the path of the
plane vibration.

We hence obtain a convenient measure of the time which has elapsed since
the beginning of par ie when the body is at any point, as H, Fig. 27, of its
path. ” For, taking as the unit of time the duration of a complete double vibra-
tion, and employing the ordinary symbol, 2z, to denote the circumference of a
circle whose radius is 1, 27¢ may express the entire space passed over by a body
making its revolutions in such a circle isochronously with the movements of the
vibrating body, and ¢ (whether its value be integral or fractional) will then de-
note at once the number of vibrations which have taken place and the number
of units of time which have elapsed since the beginning. Assuming the starting
point to be at the commencement of adouble v ibration, every integral value of Z
will denote a return to the original position, and every fractional excess will de-
note a corresponding progress in a new vibration. ‘Thus if the body be at H,
the fractional part of 2<¢ will be the are AG, and this will have the same ratio
to the entire circle which the time of describing the. portion of path, AH, has
to the total time of double vibration.

Let us now suppose that the second impulse (still normal to the first) is not
equal to the first, but greater or smaller ; and that the vibration which it would
independently produce has an amplitude (measured from the centre) represented
by a’. The figure of the orbit will, in this case, be an ellipse, with the greater
or lesser axis in the direction of the original vibration, according as.a is ereater
or less than a’. The velocities in the direction of @ will still, as before, be
represented by asin2zt, while those in the direction of a’ will be represented
by a'cos2zt; and these expressions will also stand for the ordinates of the
orbit, y and x. 2z¢ here takes the place of the former symbol, ¢.
150 UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT.

Let us now suppose that the second impulse, though still normal to the first,
is not imparted either at the limit or in the middle of its path, but at a point
corresponding to 2z¢, where ¢ may have any value whatsoever. The velocity
of the body at the time ¢ will be qsin2zt. The velocity produced by the
second impulse necessarily commences with the maximum:—, that is, with the

: : : 1 : ak :
velocity belonging to the time = and hence is a’.sing z, or a’.sin90°.

Then the difference of the two, in respect to phase—that is, to the degree of
their advancement in their respective vibrations—will be 2z¢—90°, or 90°—2z¢;
which, for convenience, put equal to 0. After a further time ¢’, the two veloc-
ities will be—

1. a. sin(2zt-+2z7t')—=a. sin(90°1L0+ 2x0!) —=a. cos(2zt! 4 0) —=y.

2. a’. sin(90° 4 2z¢') =a’. cos2zt' =a.

Expanding y, and eliminating 2z¢', there results the equation,

ay + ax? —2aa'xy.cosd =a?a' ?sin*0. [1.]

This is the general equation of the ellipse referred to its centre. It follows,
therefore, that any two impulses, applied in directions at right angles to each
other to a body susceptible of vibration, will cause the body to describe an ellip-
tical orbit, whatever be the interval between the impulses.

If, however, we suppose the second impulse to be in the direction of the orig- _
inal vibration, and not at right angles to it; and, as before, that there is a differ-
ence of time corresponding to the are 0, then the body will be impelled by two
conspiring or conflicting forces, capable of producing the simultancous velocities,
a sing, anda sin(g+0).

Let us put (a+a’cos0)?+ (a’sind)’= A’.

(a+a'cosd)? (a’sind)?
SS a oe
the symbol w denoting a determinate angle. Then,

Or,

=1—cos*w+sin2w.

a+a'cos0—=Acosw; and a! sin0d= Asinw.

Let the first of these equations be multiplied by sing, and the second by
cos¢: their sum, added member for member, will be—
a sing-+a’ sing cos0-+a’ cosg sind—=A sing cosw+A cos¢ sinw.
Or, a sing+qa’ sin(g+0)=A sin(g+e). [2.]
The first member of this equation is the expression for the velocity which the
body will possess at any time answering to ¢, after the commencement of the
vibration a, which is least advanced in phase, and the second member shows
that this velocity is that which would exist in the body at the same time, had it
been acted on by one impulse only, capable of imparting the velocity A, and
applied at a moment earlier than @ by the time corresponding to o, and later
than a’, by the time corresponding to 0—w.
The value of the velocity A, in terms of the original velocities @ and a’, may
be obtained by developing the assumed equation above, when it takes the form,

A? =—a?+a?+2aa'cosd; or, A-L V @ +a? + 2aa'cosd. [3.[
This expression is remarkable, as being the value of the diagonal of a par-
allelogram, of which the sides are a and a’, and the

A B angle of their inclination 0. In the figure annexed,
i\ let AB == DC=<, and AD =BC =a’. Also let BCD

Also, AER —a'sin0—A.smACD. And CE—a-+a’/cosO=A.cosACD.

Therefore, ACD—a», or the angle between the diagonal and the side denoting
the force corresponding to the component which is least advanced in phase, is the
measure of the interval of time between that component and the resultant, or the
time earlier than a, at which A must be applied in order to produce alone pre-
cisely the same succession of vibrations in phase and in force which is produced
by the combined action of @ and a’.

If the second impulse be oblique to the first, it may be decomposed into two
components, one acting in the direction of a, and the other at right angles to a.
The effects of these may be successively estimated according to the principles
already illustrated. And the same principles may be applied to the determina-
tion of the resultant of any number of impulses, acting in all possible directions.
The important conclusion is that, though the form of the path and the ampli-
tude of the oscillations of the body may be altered, yet they are, in all cases,
capable of determination, and the time of the vibration will be invariable.

§ II. UNDULATION.

Hitherto we have supposed that the vibrating body imparts none of its motion
to surrounding bodies. This is a ease which can hever be experimentally real-
ized, and, if it could, it is not the case which concerns us at’ present. We wish
to show the connexion between eibration and undulation, and, to this end, we
must suppose the body in vibration to be immersed in an elastic fluid, whose
particles are set in motion by it- Such a fluid is the atmosphere; and it is mat-
ter of common knowledge that sound is an effect of undulations produced in the
air by vibrating bodies. It is also well known that sound does not attend all
movements in the air, not even all movements of vibration. A certain rapidity
is required, for a reason which will presently appear.

An elastic fluid may be described as one whose particles tend to recede from
each other, or have the same mechanical relations as if they possessed the
property of mutual repulsion. The distances between the particles, in the case
of such elastic fluids as actually exist, are probably very great compared with
the magnitude of the particles themselves. When the fluid is at rest, each par-
ticle is held in equilibrium by the repulsions of its neighbors. Ifa slow move-
ment be excited among these particles, they will not, to any material degree,
alter their distances from each other; but, if any one particle, or any stratum of
particles, be driven toward those adjacent, with such suddenness that the imertia
of the latter is brought sensibly into play, then the distances will be momenta-
rily diminished, or there will occur a local compression of the fluid at that place.
This impulse, it is evident, must come from some body foreign to the fluid, for
by the definition it must appear that the fluid is incapable of unequally com-
pressing itself. Suppose, then, the compressing body, after making its sudden
advance, to stop with equal suddenness. The repelling force between ihe first
and second strata will exceed that between the second and third; but the first
stratum cannot recede on account of the obstacle. ‘The second, therefore, will
advance, diminishing its distance from the third, and so calling a greater repul-
sive force into activity between those strata also. ‘The third will then advance,
then the fourth, then the fifth, and so on. It thus appears that the movement
originally communicated to the first stratum will pass from stratum to stratum
through the whole fluid. Each stratum, moreover, will come to a state of per-
manent rest the instant the next has taken up the movement. This is in accord-
ance with the well known law of impact of equal elastic bodies. There is,
therefore, no wbration in this ease. But the progress of the movement is wnz-
form throughout the medium, and the velocity of transmission is the same, (or
152 UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT.

sensibly so,) whether the molecular movement be large or small. This last fact
we learn experimentally, though it may be deduced from considerations entirely
theoretical, as will presently be shown.

A molecular movement, like what has just been described, may be called a
tremor. A succession of tremors, swelling and sinking in magnitude, each so
excessively brief that their successive differences are comparatively null, consti-
tutes an wndulation. Such a succession of tremors must be produced in the air
by a vibrating sonorous body. ‘Take, for instance, one of the steel springs of a
musical box. It traverses, in its vibration, but a very minute portion of space,
and its duration occupies an equally minute portion of time. But as, at the end
of its path, its velocity is, for an instant, zero, while, in the middle, it is very
great, we know, from the general principles laid down above, that, at interme-
diate points, it must have as many intermediate values as it is possible to imagine
points, and we are able, moreover, to give a definite mathematical expression to
those values. These various velocities, beginning and ending with zero, and
passing through an intermediate maximum, will be successively imparted to the
stratum of particles of air which is in contact with the spring. rom this stra-
tum they will be transferred to the second, from the second to the third, and
so on.

And here, to the clear understanding of this subject, it is necessary to take
into consideration a very important fact, viz., that, however rapid may be the
motion of the spring, the trefnors which the air takes up from it advance with a
velocity vastly greater. Let us suppose, for instance, that the spring makes a
thousand simple vibrations, or five hundred double vibrations, in a second, which
is somewhat below the number corresponding to the tenor C, and that the
amplitude of each vibration, measured between the extreme limits of its excur-
sions in both directions from the position of equilibrium, is one twentieth of an
inch. In one second after beginning to vibrate it will have described only fifty
inches, but in the mean time the tremor generated by its first movement will
have passed over eleven hundred and thirty feet. In this case, accordingly, the
tremor will have more than two hundred and seventy times the mean velocity
of the vibration. Thus, while the spring is advancing from its first zero of
velocity to its maximum, a distance of one-forticth of an inch, the first and
feeblest tremor which it excited will have reached a point nearly seven inches
in advance .of it, and the stratum next before it will be receiving the most ener-
getic tremor which it is capable of imparting. When it reaches the second
zero the first tremor will be fourteen inches in advance, the middle or maximum
will be seven inches in advance, and the stratum next it will have just received
a minimum impulse corresponding to the first. Were the spring to remain in
this position, the undulation would pass on, leaving the air in its vicinity at rest.
But as it instantly commences its return, it withdraws from the stratum in con-
tact with it the support it afforded against the repulsive forces of the more ad-
vanced particles ; and accordingly that stratum follows the spring, producing a
rarefaction, or increase of distance, between the first and second. 'The repellent
forces between the first and second strata will thus be diminished, so that those
between the second and third will predominate. The second stratum will con-
sequently follow the first, and in like manner each successive stratum throughout
the fluid will successively move backward toward the one before it; or a tremor
will affect every stratum of particles, as in the case before considere d, but will
differ from that in this particular, viz: that, in the latter case, the particles are
moving in one direction, while the tremor is advancing in the contrary direction,
whereas in the case we first considered the movement of the particles is the
same in direction with that of the progress of the tremor.

It is easily seen that the whole series of tremors produced by the return
Vibration will generate an undulation equal in length to the former, and differing
from it only in the direction of movement of the particles. This is called the
~

UNDULATION. . 153

wave by rarefaction; the former, the wave by condensation. The two are com-
plementary to each other, and both are to be understood as included when in
optics we speak of ‘an undulation.”

A visible illustration of the relation between vibration and undulation, which
we have been endeavoring, in what precedes, to explain, may serve a useful
purpose in facilitating the formation of correct conceptions. Let AB represent

Fig. 31.

the range of movement of a vibrating body, C being the centre of force and
the position of equilibrium. Upon AB describe the circle ADBE. Divide
the semi-cireumference A D B into any convenient number of equal parts,
say eight, and from the points of division drop perpendiculars upon AB. ‘Take
AA! equal to the entire length of a wave, and bisect it at b’. Divide AB’
and B’A/ each into eight equal parts. From the points so found draw per-
pendiculars, upward on B/A’, and downward on AB’. Cut off these perpen-
diculars to equality with those before drawn in the circle, in reversed order for
A’B/, and in the same order for AD’, and through their extremities, as thus
determined, draw the curve AL’B/D'A’. The ordinates to this curve will
represent the velocities of the molecular movements which will be in activity
along the line AB/A’, at the end of one complete double vibration of the excit-
ing body in AB. -

The point in which this illustration fails to convey a correct impression is in
the immense exaggeration of the extent of the range AB, of the vibrating
body, as compared with AA’, the length of the undulation. In sonorous
undulations this latter usually exceeds AB some hundreds of times. Of course,
no figure which could be introduced here could preserve these proportions
without making AB imperceptible.

Let us now return for a momenf to the assumption, which, as we have said,
experiment, in the case of sound, confirms, that the velocity of waye propaga-
tion will be uniform. This assumption, antecedently to any experiment on the
subject, might be justified by the consideration that each successive molecule,
or stratum of molecules, commences its motion under preciscly the same cir-
cumstances as those of the molecules before it; taken along with the ascertained
fact that the forces of recoil of elastic bodies in general are proportional to the
extent of disturbance. ‘There is no circumstance which could make the time
occupied by one stratum of particles in transmitting the movement to the next,
longer or shorter than that similarly occupied by any other; unless it should
be the decreasing amplitude of the molecular excursions, as, in the expanding
wave, the motion is divided among a greater number of particles ; and this cir-
cumstance, under the observed law of elastic force just stated, can have no effect
upon the time of completing the oscillation.

But the proposition admits of a more direct and not a diflicult proof. If AB

to A’B. Let the natural elasticity of the air be called e. By this natural
elasticity we mean that force with which the air would tend to expand into a
vacuum, or crush in the sides of a vessel from the interior of which the air has
been removed. It is measured by the weight upon a square inch, of the column
of mercury required to balance it, and this is compared with gravity by con-
sidering that it would move a body of a unit in bulk and density (say a cubic
inch of water) as much faster than gravity alone, as it is greater than the weight
of such a unit. If, then, g represent the velocity which gravity can impart in
a second, if 4 be put for the height of the barometric column, and if D stand
for the density of the mercury in the column,

e=ohD.

Employing e’ to denote the increased elasticity of the compressed air between
A’'T’ and BE, and putting AB=a, A'B=a', and AA'=2", we have

; xz ; gl!
e'=e—-; e'—e=e Se,
x x

This difference, e’—e, is the effective force by which BE is acted upon; for
the space between BE and CD is filled with uncompressed air, which opposes
the movement of BE by the force e, while the compressed air between A'F’
and Bi urges it with the force e. Now, the velocity of movement imparted to
a body by a given force ix dependent not on the time and force only, but also
on the mass to be moved. And it will evidently make no difference in the
rapidity of propagation of movement, whether—mass remaining the same—we
suppose BEE to be the stratum of molecules which is nearest to “AR , or whether
we suppose it to be the middle stratum of a number filling the space half way
between it and AF on the one hand, and CD on the other. In either case
there will always be the same mass (m) which will be proportional to the length
of the column a, and its density, which we may represent by d:—or m will
always be as xxXd. Now the velocity v. which any foree (as e'—e) will gene
rate in the minute time ¢ in this mass, will be

or, substituting the values of e’—e and m,

And the velocity of wave-propagation (which may be denoted by V) multi-
plied into the time ¢, will give a, the distance the tremor has advanced in that
time; or z—Vé. Moreover, since x” is the distance moved by the molecules
in the time ¢, it must have the same ratio to 2, or to 2’, (for the ditierence is so
slight as not sensibly to affect the ratio) that v has to V.

Hence,

Substituting these values, we have

V= ayo? OF N72 —-s- and “V EE [4.]

But e and d are constants. Hence the velocity of the wave is uniform. *

Tn this demonstration it has been tacitly assumed that the expansive force of
a confined body of elastic fluid is inversely proportional to its bulk. This is
called the law of Mariotte; and it is true if the temperature of the fluid, when
UNDULATION—DISPERSION. 155

in a state of dilatation, is the same as when it is compressed. But compression
developes heat, and the expansive force increases directly as the temperature.
On this account it is necessary to introduce into the expression for the value of
V another constant, which is the quotient which arises from dividing the capacity
of air for heat when it is expanded under a constant pressure, by its capacity
when its pressure is raised under a constant volume. ‘These capacities being
represented by ¢’ and ¢, the velocity becomes

<
|
O

in which all the factors are still constant, and the velocity is uniform.

It will be further observed that the demonstration is independent of the am-
plitude of the vibration, and also of the length of the wave. The distance AA‘
has no necessary relation to either the one or the other of those dimensions.
The waves will be longer as the ¢2me occupied in a vibration is greater, and
shorter as the time is less; but this will be only because, in the first case, a
larger number of tremors by condensation occur, before the tremors by rarefac-
tion commence, than in the second. These tremors, in longer and shorter waves,
are arranged in larger or smaller groups, but every tremor, of whichever species,
advances with the same velocity.

Observation proves that in sonorous waves this theoretic influence is true.
In the range of musical tones, the waves corresponding to the deepest notes are
two or three hundred times longer than those belonging to the highest; yet at
any distance at which music is audible all the notes of a melody come to the
ear without the slightest perceptible disturbance of their order.

As we shall presently have to apply the undulatory theory to the explana-
tion of optical phenomena, this seems to be the proper place to anticipate an
objection which has been made to such an application of it, founded upon this
presumed constancy of velocity of propagation for waves of all lengths. The
dispersion of light by refraction, or the separation of the elementary components
of light by the prism, must, upon any theory, be regarded as irrefutable evi-
dence that the velocities of these components are unequal.* If the undulatory
theory be the true one, it is demonstrable that the undulations of the more re-
frangible rays are shorter than those of the less refrangible; and it is also neces-
sary, on that theory, to admit that in point of fact the velocities of the same
rays are less. ‘This fact so directly conflicts with the proposition just now
demonstrated, that for a long time it was regarded, and by some continues still
to be regarded, as an almost insuperable objection to the wave theory of light.
If we refer once more, however, to the demonstration, we shall see that it
involves one assumption which is not strictly truac—the assumption that AA’ is
too insignificant a quantity to be regarded when subtracted from AB, and in
therefore making AB=A'B. In the case of acoustic waves this assumption
is admissible, and observation proves that it introduces no sensible error; but
if the wave theory of light be the true one, the undulations themselves must be
excessively minute; so that it is not only quite possible, but even probable, that
the amplitude of the molecular excursions may have a very sensible ratio to the
undulation length. Observe, however, that the admission of this supposition
does not draw after it the consequence that the velocity of wave propagation

“must, as a necessity, vary with the varying lengths of the waves; it only viti-
ates our previous demonstration that this velocity is constant for waves of all
lengths. ‘The same constancy may continue to exist, but we must establish the
truth, if it is one, by different methods of proof. It is even possible that it may
exist under certain circumstances—that is, in certain media, and not in others.
This last is the conclusion which was reached by Mr. Cauchy after an examina-

tion of the question in its most general form. If we put 2 for the wave length

The velocity in the same medium is therefore a function of the length of the

insensible, the equation will become V?—=ay, or the velocity will be constant for
all the rays. ‘This he supposes to be true in a vacuum and in media which,
like the air, do not sensibly disperse the light. *

in which » is put for the index of refraction. This index is therefore a function
of the time of vibration in vacuo, which time is necessarily unaltered by refrac-
tion; since the period in the second medium is determined by the period of the
impulses, which impulses are the vibrations in the first. But the time of vibra-
tion in vacuo is inversely as the length of the wave. Hence, if we determine
by observation three wave lengths in vacuo, and three Gomres pontine indexes of
refraction, we shall have the data for determining the three unknown constants,
Aj, Ag, and A;. For all other wave lengths the indexes may then be computed.

These theoretic conelusions can only be thoroughly tested by comparing the
values deduced from the formula with the results of observation upon media of
high dispersive powers. A very elaborate series of such comparisons was made
by Prof. Baden Powell, which exhibits a general agreement between the com-
puted and observed values quite within the limits of the probable errors of ob-
servation. We are therefore justified in saying that the different velocities of
propagation of luminous undulations of different. le ngths no longer constitute a
serious objection to the undulatory theory. :

Jt will now be easily seen that so long as the movements of the vibrating
UNDULATION —PRINCIPLE OF HUYGHENS. 157

body continue, undulations will continue to flow off from’it through the air; but
that the moment they cease, the undulations will cease also. Also that during
the existence of any undulation there are actually and simultancously existing,
somewhere in its length, all the various velocities, positive and negative, which
belong successively, ‘and one at a time, to the v ibrating body. Also that, as the
progress of the undulation is uniform, its fractional parts are proportional in
length to the times of performing them; and finally that the molecular velocity
at any point may be represe mted by observi ing to what fractional part of a whole
undulation that point corresponds, and taking the sine of the same fraction of
an entire circle multiplied by the maximum velocity.

It must not be understood, because, in what has been said, mention has only
been made of tremors in the direction of the original vibration, that therefore
undulations are confined to that direction. It is impossible to disturb the equi-
librium of the molecules of an elastic fluid, at any point or in any direction
whatever, without disturbing that of all the adjacent molecules, and giving rise
to tremors in all directions. Ata distance from the vibrating body which is
considerable compared with the size of the body, therefore, the front of the
wave will be sensibly spherical, and when the body is small it may be regarded
as strictly so.

Tt is furthermore manifest that the molecular movements need not be, as we
have hitherto supposed them, dizear, nor directed to and from the centre of the
wave. As they may be derived from any of the forms of vibration which
have been described, they may be circular or elliptical; and they may be
performed in the tangent plane of the wave itself; instead along its radius.
In the ease of circular movements performed around the radius as an axis,
an undulation will then consist of a chain of particles occupying positions
less and less advanced, in the direction of progress, in their respective circles,
until the last differs from the first by 360°. At any instant, therefore, the par-
ticles in such undulations, or series of undulations, will present the exact counter-
part, direct or reversed, of the thread of a screw.

At a very great distance from the centre of disturbance the curved front of
the wave will become sensibly plane. If a solid obstruction be placed in the
way of such a plane wave, having in it a small aperture through which a minute
elementary portion of the movement may be propagated, while all the remain-
ing part is arrested, then this aperture will become the centre of a new spherical
wave on the other side of the obstruction. If the solid be perforated by a great
number of apertures, each of these will generate its own independent wave;
and all these waves, as, in their progress, they encounter each other and become
blended, will ultimately reproduce anew the plane wave from which they origi-

nated. By supposing the number of these apertures infinitely great, and the
spaces between them infinitely small, we shall arrive at the conclusion that a plane
wave is equivalent to an infinite number of spherical waves, whose centres are
infinitely near to cach ocher im that plane, and of which the plane wave is the
resultant; so that if, at any time, we intercept any number of these component
waves, either such as are contiguous to each other, or such as are separated by
determinate intervals, the consequences of the proceeding may be calculated a
priori by finding the resultant of those which remain unobstructed. This princi-
ple, which is of the highest importance to the physical theory of undulation as
applied to optics, was first laid down by Huyghens. We shall presently see
how it was applied by him to explain the phenomena of the reflection and re-
fraction of light.

§ 3. REFLECTION AND REFRACTION.

If light is to be regarded as an effect of undulation, the elastic fluid in
which its undulations are propagated must be inconceivably more rare than the
air, ‘This fluid must be supposed not only to fill all space, but also to occupy
158 UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT.

all the intervals which separate the particles of ponderable bodies; as well of
those which are opaque as of those which are transparent. It is furthermore
necessary to suppose that within these bodies it is possessed of a density or of
an elasticity different from that which belongs to it in free space ; or that the
molecules of the bodies themselves, in some manner, retard its movements
among them. Assuming for the preseut the first of these suppositions to be
the true one, it will follow that when a luminous wave encounters the surface of
a ponderable medium, its velocity of progress must undergo a change. The
nature of the change may be best understood by referring once more to the laws
which govern the impact of elastic solids. If a non-elastice ball impinge upon
another equal to it at rest in the line which joins their centres, it will divide
with the latter its motion, and the two will go on together with half the origi-
nal velocity of the first. But if the balls are elastic they will be in a state of
compression at the instant in which the motion is equally divided, and the re-
coil from this compression, acting with a force equal to that of the impact
which produced it, will destroy the remaining half of the velocity of the first,
and communicate an equal addition to the velocity of the second, so that the
latter will proceed with the entire velocity which belonged to the impinging
ball, and this will remain at rest. But if the impinging ball be heavier or
lighter than the other, the motion will not be equally divided at the moment
a ae the impact brings them to a common velocity—that is to say, at the mo-
ment when, if non-el: astic, they would begin to move together ; and the recoil,
which doubles the effect of impact, will destroy less or more than the entire
motion of the first and will add an equal amount to the motion of the second.
If less than the entire motion of the first is destroyed, that body will continue
to advance; if more, it will move ina contrary direction, or rebound. If the
second, at the noes of maximum compression, has received less than half
the motion of the impinging body, (in which case it is the lighter of the two,)
the joint velocity with which both tend to advance together will be greater than
half the original velocity; and as this will be doubled for the body originally
at rest, by the recoil, the second body wiil go on with a velocity greater than
that of the impinging body. But if the second in the collision receives more
than half the motion of the impinging body, (in which case it will be the heavier,)
the joint velocity will be less than half the original velocity, and accordingly
the final velocity of the second will not be so great as that with which the first
encountered it.

Regarding the successive strata of the ether in a luminous wave as elastic
Bodies, it will follow that so long as they are equal in mass (which will be the
case when the density is uniform) the passage of an undulation or tremor will
leave all the ether behind it at rest. But if, at any given point, a stratum of
greater mass (that is, an ether of different density) ‘be encountered, there will
be a movement of retum as well as a movement of advance; that is to say, there

will be a reflected undulation which, in the view we are now taking, will be an
undulation by condensation. If the change of density be from denser to rarer,
then the advance movement of the impinging tremor will not be entirely arrested,
and there will be a reflected undulation by rarefaction. We have here sup-
posed the impinging wave to be in that phase in which the molecules are mov-
ing in the same direction as the wave itself. Lut the consequences will be
entirely analogous if we suppose it to be in the opposite phase: only that, on
that supposition, the phases of the reflected waves will also be the reverse of
what is stated above.

It appears, therefore, that at any surface at which the luminiferous ether
undergoes a change of density, an impinging wave will, in general, be divided
into two parts, one of which will be propagated beyond the surface, while the
other will be reflected from it. It remains to be considered what. should be the
laws governing the directions in which these two waves will proceed.
REFLECTION AND REFRACTION. 159

For this purpose let us assume a
plane surface, as MN, bounding a trans-
parent medium more dense than air.
Let AA’ be the point of a plane wave
advancing in the direction PA, P’A’,

wand passing from the air into the medi-
um between the points A and B. We
have seen that this wave will be par-
tially reflected from AB. In order to
determine the front of the reflected
wave let us suppose, according to the
Pig. 33. principle of Huyghens, that every point
of the surface of AB is the origin of a new spherical wave propagated in every
direction from that point. It will be sufficient for the illustration to attend to
a few only of these poiuts, as, for instance, A, C, and B:—C being taken half
way between the other two. By hypothesis AA’ is perpendicular to PA.
Draw CA” parallel to PA. The velocity of the reflected wave being equal to
that of the incident, when the wave front AA’ reaches the position Cd, the ele-
mentary reflected wave from A will have travelled to a distance equal to CA.”
When’ A’ reaches B the reflected wave from A will have reached a distance
AB’ equal to A’B. Also, at the same instant, the elementary wave from C will
have travelled a distance CB” equal to 6B=A'S. With A and C as centres de-
scribe the small circular ares shown at B’ and B”, and from B draw BB’ tangent
to the first of these ares. It will also be tangent to the second. For if AB’Q’
be drawn from A through the point of contact B’, and CB’Q” parallel to
it, then, because AB is bisected in C, CB” is half of A B'; and it is also
perpendicular to B’B, consequently B’ is a point in the spherical wave front
which originates from C. And as similar reasoning may be applied to all the
elementary waves reflected from the points between A and B, it follows that
the tangent BB’ is the resultant reflected wave front moving in the direction
AQ’ or BQ. Also, from the similarity of the triangles AA’B and AB’B, it
is evideut that the inclination of the wave front AA’, or of the ray PA to the
reflecting surface MN, is equal to that of the wave front BB’, or of the ray
BQ to the same surface. The incident and reflected rays are therefore equally
inclined also to the zormal to the surface: or, in other words, the angle of re-
flection is equal to the angle of incidence.

If we turn our attention to that portion of the incident wave which is propa-
gated into the medium beyond the surface, the construction which determines
the refracted wave front is analogous to the foregoing. Only, in the second
medium, as it is the denser of the two, the velocity of ‘propagation will be
diminished. Suppose it to be so in the ratio of » to 1, the circles described
from A and C must have their radii, AB’/” and Ce reduced below A’'B, and
5B in the same proportion.* The wave front of the refracted wave will then
be the common tangent BB!” of these circles. Also, if we observe that A’B—=

AB sin. A‘'AB, and AB!’ = AB sin. B'” BA, we shall obtain the proportion,
sin A’/AB: sin B’’BA:: A’B: AB” :: x: 1.

But these angles, being the inclinations of the wave fronts to the refracting
surface, are also the inclinations of the rays themselves to the zormal to the

* A diminished velocity might be a consequence of a change in the time of a vibration
without a corresponding change in the undulation length; or it might be caused by a change
af both. But, in the case in hand, we are not at liberty to assume any change in the time
of the vibration, because the impulses which produce the molecular movements in the second
medium are the vibrations themselves of the first. The undulations in the two media are,
therefore, isochronous; and it is only possible to explain the difference of velocity of undula-
tion progress by supposing a change of undulation length.
160 UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT.

surface; that is, they are the angles of incidence and refraction. The law of
Snellius is thus very simply deduced from the theory of undulation. It also
appears from the foregoing proportion that the velocity before refraction. is to
the velocity after remachen as the sine of incidence is to the sine of refraction,
or as the index of refraction is to' unity.

It was not until after Huyghens had perfected his theory of refraction, that
he became acquainted with the remarkable case of Ieeland spar. In order to
reconcile the phenomena presented. by this crystal with his theory, it was
necessary to suppose that the incident wave is divided at the refracting patie
into ¢wo waves having unequal velocities. But, inasmuch as one of these wave
must, on this hy pothesis, and, in order to meet the phenomena, have a eine
greater in some directions than in others, it occurred to him that the second
wave must probably be spheroidal, and not spherical. Following out this in-
genious idea, he presently discovered that it contained a pertect explanation of
all the apparent anomalies of double refraction; and by generalizing the
method which has just been given for finding the direction of a ray after re-
fraction, and extending it to embrace spheroidal as well as spherical wave
surfaces, he contrived a geometrical construction by which the path of the ex-
traordinary as well as of the ordinary ray may, in all cases, be exactly deter-
mined.

In order to understand this, let it be observed that the greatest and least
axes of the spheroidal wave will evidently be proportioned to the greatest and
least velocities of the ray in the crystal; and these velocities are inversely as
the corresponding indexes of refraction. Also, as the least index, in the case
of Iceland spar, is that which is found in the plane perpendicular to the optic
axis, and as the refraction is there conformable to the law of Snellius, it is
manifest that this is the plane of greatest velocity, and is the equatorial plane
of the spheroid. The polar axis of the wave corresponds in direction, therefore,
with the optic axis of the crystal. Let it also be remembered that the least
velocity of the extraordinary ray is the constant velocity of the ordinary ray ;
or is, in other words, the radius of the spherical wave.

If, now, a plane wave of light fall obliquely upon the surface of a erystal of
Iceland spar, intersecting it in a straight line, any point of this line of inter-
section may be assumed as the common centre of a spherical and a spheroidal
wave, having one diameter in common, parallel to’the optic axis of the crystal,
which common diameter is the axis of revolution of the spheroid. Moreover,
as this supposition may be made of every other imaginable point of the line of
intersection, it follows that there will be an infinite number of elementary
waves, spherical and spheroidal, simultaneously generated. As the incident
wave advances, the line of intersection will advance along the surface of the
crystal; and in every position of this line a new set of elementary waves will
in like manner originate. By reasoning similar to that which was employed in
the illustration of ordinary refraction, it may be shown that, in any position of
the incident wave, all the elementary spherical waves will be touched by one
and the same tangent plane; and all the elementary spheroidal waves will be
touched by one plane likewise. These two tangent planes must intersect each
other in the line in which the incident wave intersects, at the moment, the sur-
face of the crystal, or the plane of that surface; but they will not coincide ex-
cept in the single case in which the velocities of wave progress are equal; that
is to say, when the movement of progress within the crystal is in the direction
of the optic axis.

The geometrical problem of determining the path of the extraordinary ray
reduces itself, therefore, to this. With the point of incidence as a centre
deseribe a sphere. Upon that diameter of the sphere which coincides with the
optic axis deseribe a spheroid of revolution, whose revolving axis is to its fixed
DOUBLE REFRACTION. 161

axis as the greatest index of refraction is to the least. In the plane of inci-
dence lay down the path of the ordinary ray according to the law of Snellius.
Through the intersection of this path with the surface of the sphere pass a
plane tangent to the sphere; and through the intersection of this tangent plane
with the plane of the refracting surface pass another plane tangent to the
spheroid. The radius of the spheroid drawn to the point of contact will be the
path of the extraordinary ray.

The following is the construction usually given in this case. It has the
advantage of involving only the angle of incidence. Let the velocity before
refraction be represented by unity; and after refraction let the velocity of the
ordinary ray be v, and that of the extraordinary ray perpendicular to the optic
axis be wv’. With the point of incidence ‘as a centre let there be described a
sphere and a spheroid, as before, the radius of the sphere being =v, and the
revolving axis of the spheroid being v'. On the plane of the refracting sur-
face and in the plane of incidence take a distance (in the direction of progress)
equal to the cosecant of the angle of incidence, and through the point so de-
termined draw a perpendicular to the plane of incidence. The plane passing
through this perpendicular and touching the spheroid, determines the direction
of the extraordinary ray, which, as before, coincides with the radius to the
point of contact.

To illustrate by a comparatively simple case. In figure 34, let MN be the
surface of the crystal, and CD the direction of the optie axis. Let also the plane
of incidence (represented by the plane of the figure)
be a principal section. RC being the direction of
the ray and C the point of incidence, make RC =
unity, draw CG perpendicular to RC, and RG par-
allel to MN, cutting CGinG. Draw GQ parallel
to RC. Then GQ being made radius, QC is the
cosecant of QCG = PCR = the angle of incidence.
Then if, with the centre C, a sphere be described
whose radius is CD = v, and also a spheroid whose
polar radius is CD also, and whose equatorial radius is made = v’, the tangents
QE, QI’, drawn through Q to the sphere and spheroid respectively, will deter-
mine the directions of CK, CF, the ordinary and extraordinary rays.

The hypothesis of Huyghens completely determines the geometrical law of
double refraction, but it leaves the physical cause of the phenomenon unex-
plained. It is easy to understand how the disturbance at a single point of the
molecules of an ether of uniform density and elasticity should produce a spheri-
cal wave; and it is also easy to comprehend how a similar disturbance in an
ether of variable density or variable elasticity should produce a wave having
a surface not spherical; but, as undulation was understood in the time of
Huyghens, it was not easy to comprehend how waves of both these descriptions
should be generated in the same ether simultaneously. We have already seen
that Huyghens himself was very greatly astonished to observe that, when the
two rays into which a single incident ray is divided by double refvaction in a
erystal of Icland spar, fall, after emergence, upon a second similar crystal, they
are, each of them, in some, and in fact, in most positions of this second erystal,
again divided, so as, of the single original ray, to make four; while in other
positions they are not so subdivided, but remain two only. But, in fact, this
new phenomenon presents no really new cause of astonishment. The thing
which ought to have surprised him, the point which involved, in truth, all the
difficulty of the conception, lay in the actual coexistence of dissimilar waves in
the same ether. No mode of explaining this fact could well have failed to ex-
plain the other at the same time.

It was only, however, after the entire inadequacy of any theory of light which

162 UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT.

had been suggested, to explain the multiplied and brilliant phenomena of polari-
zation and double refraction had been universally felt and acknowledged, that an
idea presented itself (and this simultaneously, or nearly so, to two distinguished
physicists) which contained within itself the key to the original and to all sue-
ceeding difficulties. In undulation, as understood by Huyghens, Newton, and
others, the molecular movements were supposed to be always in the direction of
wave-progress and the contrary. ‘Though this is the case with the atmospheric
undulations which produce sound, it was ingeniously suggested by Fresnel and
Young that it is probably not so with the ethereal undulations which produce
light. Polarized rays are differently affected to reflecting surfaces on their dif-
ferent sides. Suppose the movements of the molecules to be nurmal to the di-
rection of progress, and this fact is easily explained. And not only that, but a
whole class of perplexing, and previously, in fact, entirely inexplicable phenom-
ena, to which we shall have presently to attend, are, by this simple supposition,
rendered, not merely intelligible, but so necessary consequences of the hypothe-
sis, that they might have been predicted (as some of them actually were) before
having been ever observed.

Though the idea of transverse vibrations occurred, as just remarked, to Young
as well as to Fresnel, it is, nevertheless, to Fresnel alone that the credit is due
of having made it the basis of a theory fully wrought out and est :blished, as well
upon the basis of a thorough mathematical analysis, as of an elaborate and ex-
tensive experimental verification. ‘To apply it at present to explain the possi-
ble coexistence of two independent waves of different curvature and different
progressive velocity, originating simultaneously from a common centre in a
doubly refracting medium, we have but to make the two assumptions follow-
ing, Viz:

1. ‘The molecular movements, being in both of the two waves at right angles
to the direction of progress, are performed in planes which are at right angles
to each other.

2. The elasticity of the ether which determines the velocity of a tremor is
not the same in all directions within the medium.

It will presently be more part.cularly shown in what manner those two as-
sumptions serve to explain all the phenomena which appeared so unaccountable
to Huyghens, as well as many others which were not known to him.

§ IV. INTERFERENCE.

We will now proceed to apply briefly the theory of undulation to the expla-
nation of some of the phenomena which we have heretofore detailed without
accounting for. Many, or most of the phenomena depend on the mutual influ-
ence of different undulations conspiring or conflicting in consequence of the
superposition of one upon the other. A gross illustration often employed in
explaining this idea is to refer to the appearances presented by the intersecting
rings formed in water into which two pebbles have been thrown. The elevated
rings and their intervening depressions are undulations; the molecular move-
ments are vertical, while the undulation progress is horizontal. When the rings
intersect, the points where two ridges cross are doubly elevated; the points
where two hollows cross are doubly depressed; while the points in which a
ridge in one system crosses a hollow of the other are neither elevated nor de-
pressed. The term applied to this influence of one undulation upon another is
enterference.
PRINCIPLE OF INTERFERENCES. 163

The interferences of liquid
waves are finely illustrated in
the undulations of mereury con-
tained in a vessel of elliptical
figure. Ifa disturbance be pro-
duced at one of the focal points of
the ellipse, the circular waves pro-
ceeding from it will, by reflection
from the sides of the vessel, form
a second similar system having
for its centre the other focus. If
the corresponding points of in-
ferference be connected, they will
form, as the figure shows, two
sets of curves, elliptical and hy-
perbolic, having for their com-
mon foci the foci of the original
ellipse.

The interference of waves of
sound is often very perceptible. It is observed only in musical sounds because
it can only be observed in those whose undulations are continuous and uniform ;
and such sounds are musical. It is best observed when the waves are long—as
in the case of the grave tones of the heavier organ-pipes. The sinking and
swelling of the sound, called by musicians the deat, is owing to one of the inter-
fering waves being slightly longer or shorter than the other. In many r-peti-
tions this slight difference of length accumulates until it reaches half an undu-
lation, when, if the two waves originally conspired—that is, (to borrow again an
illustration from the water,) if their two crests were originally superposed—-thy
will, after this difference has crept in, be in conflict; or the crest of one will fall
upon the hollow of the other. During this interval a sink’ng of the sound will
have been observed; but immediately after, as the difference of path goes on
increasing from a half to a whole undulation, the sound will swell again as the
two crests once more approach superposition. Weneed hardly remark that the
interference of waves of sound of perfectly equal length would not be pereepti-
ble to us; for, in that ease, the resultant sound would be a coastant. If we en-
deavor, by moving about while two bodies of precisely similar pitch are sound-
ing. to pass from the points of conspiring to those of conflicting undulation, we
shall not find it easy to detect these points for several reasons

In the first place, when the molecular movements are normal to the way.
front, as in the ease of sound, there is no complete interference, or approach to
complete interference, except when the waves are tangential, or approximately
so, to each other; except, therefore, in or near the line of the centres, and except,
it may be added, when the distance between the centres is an exact number of
half undulations. Again, at the intersections of sonorous waves, whether the
molecular movements conspire or conflict, their resultant is never so great as the
sum, nor so small as the dsference of the two components. The difference of
intensity between the maxima and minima of sound in such cases will not be
striking, unless they succeed each other with brief intervening intervals of time,
as in the case of the beats.*

It is, however, by this second method that we detect the interferences of light,
and not at all by the first. That is to say, we discover these interferences by
moving the eye through the space where they exist, when the points of maxi-
mum and minimum brightness are easily observed ; or we let fall the interfering

ferences of sound from two pipes in perfect unison,

rays upon a white surface, when the same points will become manifest by their
difference of illuminating power. The first method is best, especially if the eye
be assisted by a lens, but the second is that which was used by the earliest
observers.

We cannot detect the interferences of light by observing periodical maxima
and minima, like the beats in music, because of the almost inconceivable short-
ness of the undulations. But if the waves of light were as long as the waves
of sound, interferences might easily be made to manifest themselves, something
in the manner of the Senuillation of the stars, though with a regularity ee
that phenomenon does not possess

Before proceeding now to a more ¢ particular inquiry into the laws of the inter-
ference of luminous waves, it is proper to make two or three preliminary ex-
planations. ‘The phenomena compel us to the assumption that the molecular
movements in these waves are normal to the direction of progress; that is, to
the direction of vision. In other words, they are in the plane of the wave itself,
and at right angles to the ray. If we suppose that all ethereal tremors have
this character, we must account for the fact by presuming that the ether is
nearly incompressible. If this is the case, the vibrations of the luminous body,
at its surface, may move /ateral/y the whole stratum of ethereal particles which
is most nearly in contact with it, though they produce little if any motion per-
pendicular to the surface.

If MN, for example, be the surface of the luminous body, A,A,A, &c., the
row of ethereal particles next it, A’,A’,A’, &c., the row beyond this, and so on,

the arrangement of these particles will, on the

, principle roe equilibrium, be such that the dis-

Fig. 36. &c., on account of the very difficult compressi-
bility of the ether, they may, nevertheless,
move them all sideways in the direction AB. ILct the entire force of this
movement be represented by AB. Join AA’, and draw BC perpendicular to
it. The foree AB may be resolved into the two forees CB and AC, of which
the second is directed toward the centre of A’. This again may be resolved
into the two, AD and DO, of which the first is normal to MN, and, by hy-
pothesis, produces no sensible movemeut. But DC is parallel to MN, and, as
all the other particles in the stratum A’,A’, and are simultaneously acted upon
by similar forees, they will all move in the direction of DC, without changing
their distances from each other.

It is not necessary to suppose that the ether has absolutely no compressibility.
In fact, if it had none at all, it could have no elasticity ; or, what is, singularly
enough, practically the same thing, its elasticity would be infinite. But its
compressibility must be esteemed very slight, and its elasticity accordingly very
high, not merely because of the necessity of admitting lateral or transverse
vibrations, but because of the immense velocity of light. It is easy to see that,
if the ether were totally incompressible, the velocity of light (if in such cireum-
stances there could be any such thing as light) would be infinite; that is to say,
any movement in the ether, if it could be produced at all, must be produced
simultaneously through the whole extent of the ether. In proporticn as com
pression is easy, the rapidity of the propagation of a disturbance (density re-
maining the same) must be less. The immense velocity of light affords, therefor. ,
« strong ground for believing that the compressibility of the ether is very small.
Still, it is hardly conceivable that there should exist absolutely no molecular
movements normal to the wave at all; and, in fact, the existence of such vibra-
PHYSICAL THEORY OF POLARIZATION. 165

tions is now generally admitted, though they are usually assumed to be incapable
of impressing the organs of vision.

But while the molecular movements in luminous waves are assumed to be at
right angles to the direction of progress, or of the ray, there exists no natural
necessity to determine them in azimuth toward one direction rather than toward
another. It is accordingly capable of easy demonstration that ordinary light
has no determinate plane or azimuth of vibration, but that its successive undu-
lations assume every variety of azimuth. ‘There is no proof, however, that
changes of azimuth are incessant; in other words, that many undulations, in
fact, many thousands or perhaps millions, do not follow each other usually, in
the same azimuth, between the changes. This, indeed, is probable, since the
ethereal vibrations take their character from those of the luminous body, and
these may reasonably be presumed to have a certain persistence in their modes
of vibration, or at least not to undergo incessant and abrupt changes. Beyond
a certain limit, however, this persistency could not continue; nor could there,
among the changes which occur, be a predominating disposition to return to one
azimuth oftener than to another, or to remain in it longer, without imparting to
the light, more or less decidedly, the character of polarization. If five hundred
millions of the mean undulations of white light were to follow each other in a
single azimuth, they would occupy less than the millionth part of a second ;
and, accordingly, if five hundred millions of such undulations should take place
in each of a million different azimuths successively, the whole would be per-
formed in one second, and no instrumental test could detect polarization in the
aggregate beam.

The polarization of light consists, therefore, in the determination of all its
vibrations to a single plane. The effect of double refraction is to do this with
both the rays into which the incident common light is divided; and the effect
of reflection at certain definite angles, from certain bodies, as heretofore ex-
plained, is to do the same with the reflected ray.

Prof. Dove, of Berlin, has illustrated in a very ingenious manner the physical
relation of common to polarized light. A Nicol’s prism having been mounted
in such a manner as to admit of being rapidly rotated about its axis, he trans-
mitted through it a ray of common light, which gave, of course, an emergent
polarized ray capable of traversing a crystal of Iccland spar (having its princi-
pal plane coincident with the plane of polarization) without double refraction.
On setting the prism into rotation double refraction instantly appeared, and the
ray was equally divided by the crystal in all azimuths.

When two polarized rays follow each other in the same path or intersect un-
der a very acute angle, it is obvious that, if their planes of polarization agree
in azimuth, they are in condition to interfere. If in phase of undulation they
are perfectly accordant, the two waves will be superposed, and the molecular
velocity of the resultant wave will be equal to the sum of the velocities of the
two components; but if there is a difference of phase between them amounting
to exactly half an undulation, then the crest of one wave will fall on the hollow
of the other, and the resultant molecular velocity will be equal to the difference
of velocities of the components. If the difference of phase is any other frac-
tion of an undulation, the circumstances of the resultant are determined by
precisely the same equation as that which has been given for the resultant mo-
tion of a vibrating solid, (equation [3],) in the same case. If a vibrating solid
derive its motion from two impulses which are not synchronous, we have seen
that its phases of vibration will be somewhere between those which the im-
pulses would have separately produced. Its actual vibration will therefore
produce an undulation or series of undulations, which will occupy the same
situation in space relatively to those which the separate impulses would have
produced, a8 the generating vibration occupies relatively to the component vi-
brations, in time. And it matters not to the result, whether we suppose two
166 UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT.

component systems of undulations to be first generated by independent vibra-
tions and then combined; or suppose the two vibrations to be first combined,
and then to generate a single resultant system of undulations—the resultant
system is the same in both cases. On the first hypothesis, we allow two forces
to work out their effects separately and then unite the effects; on the second,
we unite the forces themselves, and make them unite their effects from the start.

Referring to the equation just cited, we see that the resultant molecular ve-
locity, when the movements are in the same plane, takes every value according
to the difference of phase of the components, from the sum to the difference of
the two component velocities. Thus, if @ be put — 0°, the equation

A— V@+a?-+ 2aa’ cos0, will become A= Va?+a?+2aa'—=a+a’,

It may aid in obtaining clear conceptions of this subject to employ a graphic
illustration. Such notions are very desirable at this point of our progress, if
we would understand the application of the theory of undulation to the expla-
nation of optical phenomena; and especially of those of highest interest. In
the annexed figure, let the two curves PHA, QMN, represent two undula-
tions, whose molecular velocities are the ordinates drawn to the common axis,
MNAGC, and whose maxima velocities are PP’, QQ’. The undulation PHA
is the more advanced in position; but, referred to any common intersecting
line as LA, the undulation QMN is the more advanced in phase.

Now we have seen that the resultant maximum molecular velocity, when
these undulations are combined, will be the diagonal of a parallelogram, of
which PP’ and QQ’ are the sides, and of which the angle of inclination of
the adjacent sides shall be equal to the difference of phase between the compo-
nents. Accordingly, from the point A, where the curve representing the undu-
lation least advanced in phase crosses the axis, measure off AC, in the direction
of progress, equal to QQ’, the maximum velocity of the wave most advanced
in phase. From ©, measure backward, CB, equal to PP’, the other compo-
nent maximum velocity. From the centre ©, with the radius CA, describe

Draw AL perpendicular to the axis at A. Upon this take AK, the devel-

Ad is the development of the are AED, which measures the angle DCA, the
difference of phase. For HA is to NA as a half undulation is to the difference
of phase:—that is, as a semocircumference is to the arc which measures the

KH, we have.

HA: NA::KA: Ad: ACXz: are AED(—Ad.)

Join therefore CD, and complete the parallelogram CDGB, drawing the
diagonal CG. ‘Then from what has been before demonstrated, the angle ACE,
or the are AK, is the measure of the interval in phase between the resultant
and the component CB — PP’. The curve of that component crosses the axis
in A. Let, then, Ae be the development of AE, and draw eF parallel to KH.
F is the point at which the curve of the resultant undulation will cross the axis
in ascending. Making FS — AH, S is the point where the same curve crosses
in descending. And making SR’ = HP’, R’ is the point of maximum resultant
velocity. Draw R’R perpendicular to the axis, and make it equal to GC, the
diagonal of the parallelogram; R is the vertex of the r sultant curve. Any
other points of this curve may be found by taking the sums of the ordinates of
the two components corresponding to the same absciss or point of the axis,
with like sigus when both components are above or both below the axis, and
with unlike signs when one is above and the other below, for the ordinates of
the resultant curve. The curve itself may then be drawn through the points
so determined.

This construction enables us visibly to verify the analytical results which
were just now presented. Let the radius, CD, revolve round the point C. the
parailelogram changing its figure as the revolution advances, and the variations
in the value of CG may easily be conceived.

Thus, when 6 = DA = 0°, the point D will fall upon CA, and the point
G upon BH. CB and BG will then be ina straight line, and CG will equal
CB + BG =a+a'. ween 6 = 90°, DCA and GBC are right angles,
and CG = VBu? + BG, or, A= Va + a”. When 0 —180°, CD falls
on the axis to the right of C, and BG falls on BA. Hence, CG = a—a’.
In this case, if a = a’, <oee = 0; or if equal waves differ in phase by half an
undulation they destroy each other. The two curves intersect the axis in the

same points, but the convexity of one of them corresponds in position to the
concavity of the other. Also, if equal waves differ in phase in any manner,
the crest of the resultant will fall half way between the crests of the two com-
nents.

When @ exceeds 180°, or the waves are more than half an undulation apart
the angle of the paraliclogram must still be measured from A through D round
to D’, and the inclination of the diagonal must be taken in the same way, from
A through ED and D’ round to KE’. These ares being developed on AL
produced, will give the position of the movable component and of the resultant
by drawing parallels to cut KH, as before. It will be seen in this case that, in
effect, the wave which we have regarded as the preceding wave becomes the
Allowing wave, and vive versa; for if we consider the crests that nearest agree
in position as forming pairs, these pairs will be broken up by a discordance of
more than half an undulation, and new pairs will be fermed—the lagging crests
ceasing to agree with those crests of the other component which are before
them, and beginning to agree with those behind them. Hence, as the resultant
crest must fall between the two components of a pair, it in this case goes further

back than the wave which our construction makes the following wave. This
construction, therefore, embraces all possible cases.

But if the rays which are thus brought together are polarized in planes at
right angles to each other, then it will be manifest that the movements of neither
can interfere with those of the other; but, as in the case of the vibrating solid
again, they may produce a resultant of which the character may vary from a
plane vibration through every form of ellipse to a circle. Equation [1] ex-
presses the circumstances of this ease.

Thus, if, in that equation, we assume the difference of phase represented by
8 to be 90°, cos 6 becomes 0, sin 61, and the equation is

Coy 4 Gana:
which is the equation of the ellipse when the axes of figure coincide with the axes
of co-ordinates. If we make a = a’, then we have

which is the equation of the circle.

which is the equation of a straight line; and if @ once more be put =a’, z= y.
or the straight line makes equal angles with the directions of the original
molecular movements.

If the planes of the two undulations are neither normal to each other, nor co-
incident, there will be an interference which will be more or less complete, as
the inclination of the planes is less.

Rays of common light, if the difference of their paths be not very great, will
interfere, notwithstanding the fact that their undulations are confined to no
determinate azimuth. This fact proves, what has been above assumed, that the
changes of azimuth in common light cannot be incessant. But there is one con-
dition absolutely indispensable to produce interference in any case; it is that
the rays shall have a common origin.

If the light subjected to experiment be unpolarized, the necessity of the con-
dition is easily explained. The changes of the azimuth of vibration in two
such rays could not, except upon a supposition which has an infinity of chances
against it, take place at the same intervals and in the same order; and if they
did, the chances would be equally great against the coincidence of those planes.
It appears, however, to be true, as well of polarized rays as of common light,
that they will not interfere unless from the same origin. Weare obliged, there-
fore, to resort to the supposition, which has @ prieri, moreover, strong
probability in its favor, that there are irregularities at the very origin of the
undulations, or at the surface of the luminous body, which are propagated
with the undulations, and which will prevent the permanent coincidence or
conflict of two sets of undulations, unless both are equally affected by the same
irregularities. hus, if we observe the flame of a candle, we shall see that its
wavering motion will make the point of departure of the undulations it gene-
rates unsteady. But a difference of a single one hundred-thousandth part of
an inch in the position of the origin of two successive sets of undulations,
would put them into entirely opposite phases. Considering the activity and
the energy of the forces at work at the surfaces of incandescent bodies, it is
impossible to believe that the luminous waves which they generate can have
their origins absolutely invariable in position.

These things premised, we are prepared to apply the theory of undulation
to the explanation of all the phenomena of diffraction, polarization, and the
colors of thin or thick plates, in regard to which we have heretofore stated only
the facts. It is worth while, however, in the first place, to give a moment’s at-
tention to an experiment first suggested by Vresnel upon purely theoretic
grounds, and afterward made by him with complete success; in which the cir-
cumstances preclude the application of any of the special hypotheses which
had been previously conceived, for the purpose of accounting for the phenomena,
INTERFERENCE—FRESNEL’S MIRROR EXPERIMENT. 169

while the observed effects are consequences absolutely necessary of the undu-
latory theory.

Two mirrors, AB and AC, meet at a very
obtuse angle at A. JR is a minute radiant
point. The best radiant for this purpose is
the concentrated light from a small solar beam
introduced into a dark room and brought to a
focus by a lens of small focal distance. Rays
of light from R, reflected by the mirrors, pro-
ceed as from the points S and §/, which are
in the perpendiculars let fall from R on the
planes of the mirrors severally, and as far
behind them as LR itself is before. If the mir-
rors AB and AC were in one and the same
plane, the points S and 8’ would coincide, or
there would be but one image of R formed by
the reflection; and the two images will be
nearer to each other, just in proportion as the
angle CAB approaches to two right angles.
The spherical waves proceeding from R as a
centre would be reflected from a single mirror in a system entirely similar to the
original one, proceeding apparently from the image behind the mirror. When
there are two mirrors and two such images, there will be two such systems of
spherical waves, which will intersect each other in ares more and more nearly
coincident, as the images which are their centres are nearer together. In the
figure there are drawn, with equal radii, from S and 8’, a succession of equidis-
tant circular ares, which may be considered to represent the crests of the suc-
cessive waves. The intermediate dotted ares may be taken for the hollows.
According to the principles already laid down there should be increased energy
of movement—that is an increase of brightness—wherever two ridges or two
hollows cross each other; and diminished movement, or a diminution of light
where a hollow crosses a ridge. And as it is obvious, on inspection, that the
intersections will be more widely separated from each other in proportion as the
centres are nearer to each other, it follows that these theoretically predicted
effects will be more conspicuous and more decided in proportion as the planes of
the two mirrors approach coincidence. If the light reflected from such a pair
of mirrors be received upon a screen, it will be obvious that, whatever be the
distance from § and 8’, there will be a point, as a, where the radii Sa and S/@
will be equal ; and as this will be true of all points in a line through @ parallel
to the intersection of the planes of the mirrors, there should here be a coincidence
of movements, and accordingly a bright stripe. At a little distance on each
side of this stripe there will be found parallel lines, in which the radius from
one of the centres will exceed that from the other by the length of one entire
undulation; and in these lines the movements will be once more in coincidence,
and the light will again be in excess. But between them and the central line
there will be found other positions in which the radii will differ by only half an
undulation ; and, as the movements in these positions will be directly opposed
to each other, the light should disappear. Extending this reasoning, we should
look for a series of stripes alternately dark and bright on each side of the cen-
tral bright stripe, at distances sensibly equal to each other. ‘These conclusions
are fully confirmed by experiment.*

* Prof. Potter, of London, affirms, in opposition to all other experimenters, that the centrak
stripe in this experiment is often seen dark instead of light; and in fact more usually so
than otherwise.—[ London Journal of Science, XVI, 1840. Also, Physical Optics, London,
1856.] Prof. Baden Powell, on the other hand, states that he has endeavored to verity this
assertion with every possible attention to the conditions prescribed by Prof. Potter, but
entirely without success.—[ A General and Elementary View of the Undulatory Theory, &¢.,
London, 1841. ]
170 UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT.

’

By means of a movable eyepiece, provided with a micrometrical apparatus,
Fresnel accurately measured the distances of these stripes from each other,
and thus deduced the lengths of the undulations by which they are produced.
In fact, as the Zocus of the central bright stripe is in the line of intersections, of
which a is one, and that of the adjacent bright stripe is in the line of intersee-
tions, of which 4 is one, we have a small triangle aéc, whose sides are severally
perpendicular to those of the triangle a8’; and accordingly,

2.SS/
aS:S8S!:: 6c: ac; or bale = : [7.]

But ac is the length of the undulation, whence it appears that this length is
equal to the distance between two adjacent similar stripes multiplied by the
distance between the two radiant centres, and divided by the distance of either
centre from the screen. As the radiants in this experiment are merely virtual
and not actual, the values of SS’ and aS cannot be conveniently measured. But
it may be observed that the fraction

Od

Hence, ac=bc.2sin $8a8/—6c.2sin BAA’. [8.

The angle SaS’ may be directly measured by an instrument placed at a, o
the angle BAA’, which is the inclination of the mirrors, may be vtherwise deter-
mined.

Putting 2 for the length of the undulation, ¢ for the angle $Sa8’, and 0 for
the distance between the stripes, the foregoing equation gives

i—=2sing X06; or 0=

2sing ; [9.]

Whence it appears that the distance between the stripes will be greater as
g is less, or as the radiant centres are nearer together. ‘The same process
applied to the distance from the middle stripe to the second one on either side
will give—

2a g BA

2sing 2sing

So that the successive stripes are equidistant from each other.

Grimaldi’s case of diffraction, in which the radiant centres were two minute
apertures very near to each other through which light was introduced into a
dark rocm, was manifestly analogous in principle to this. To that case the first
of the formule just given may be directly applied.

The mirrors in the experiment of Fresnel require very careful adjustment.
If, at the edges where they meet, one or the other projects, however slightly,
the effect will be sensibly impaired. A prism of glass having two adjacent faces
very slightly inclined to each other might be used to produce the interferences
by total reflection from these inclined surfaces, without being subject to this ob-
jection. ‘The other faces of the prism would require to be so adjusted that the
light might enter and emerge through them sensibly at right angles. The dis-
advantage would be that the angle of the reflecting faces would be invariable.
The experiment admits of being performed, and has been performed, by the
help of asingle mirror, placed almost but not quite parallel to the original rays,
so as to cause a portion of the wave very slightly to deviate, and thus to inter-
fere with the portion which is not reflected. In this case it is obvious that the
system of fringes produced can embrace only one-half of those which are seen
in the experiment of Fresnel.

In place of Fresnel’s mirrors Mr. Arago employed a glass prism to produce
interference by refraction instead of by reflection. Arago’s prism has a cross
section of the form of a very obtuse angled isosceles triangle; the light being
received in the experiment perpendicularly upon the base, and emerging at the
UNDULATION LENGTHS AND NUMBERS. 141

obtuse vertex in two interfering waves. The effects correspond in all respects
with those produced by I’resnel’s mirrors.

Mr. Arago also introduced a modification of the experiment, which, though
simple, is very interesting in the bearing upon theory, of its results. In the
path of one of the interfering rays he interposed a thin lamina of mica. As
mica is transparent, it was to be expected that fringes would continue to ap-
pear after the interposition as well as before; and this expectation is realized.
But as the undulation length cannot be the same in the mica as in the air, since
the refracting power of mica exceeds that of air, it was also to be expected that
the fringes would chang» their place; and this expectation also is fulfilled. The
direction of the displacement will depend upon the question, which of the two
waves, after the lamina is interposed, will be found, when they reach the position
of the originally luminous central stripe, to be advanced beyond the other in its
phase of undulation. This will of course be true of that which has the least
average length of undulation. If the undulations in mica are of less length
than in the air, (a necessary supposition, as we have already seen,) the average
length of undulation on the side of the mica will be less than that on the other side ;
and accordingly the phase at the central line of meeting will be most advanced
on the side of the mica. We must therefore assume a line upon the screen par-
allel to the central line, such that the length of path from the radiant on the side
of the mica shall be as much less than the length of path from the other radiant
to the same line, as the thickness of the lamina of mica is less than that of a
lamina of air embracing the same number of undulations would be, in order to
find the position of the bright stripe which is central in the displaced system.
The whole system is of course moved toward the side of the mica.

If homogeneous light be employed in the experiment with Fresnel’s mirrors
or Arago’s prism, equation [7.] or [8.] furnishes the means of measuring the
undulation lengths in different parts of the spectrum. In the following table
are embraced the results of such a measurement, made by Fraunhofer and
expressed in decimals of an inch, for fourteen different positions determined by
their relations to the colors or to the fixed lines of the spectrum. ‘The undulation-
lengths in this table are taken from Fraunhofer: the numbers per second are
computed on the supposition of a velocity of light of 192,700. miles to the
second.

172 UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT.

If we compare the numbers of undulations per second in the foregoing table
with the numbers per second of acoustic undulations corresponding to a given
pitch, we shall observe that, if these vibrations had power to affect the sense of
hearing, the middle yellow would produce a tone forty-one octaves above the
fundamental C, or C between the staves; and the middle red would be forty
octaves above the “ Stuttgard pitch,” or normal A, taken at 440 complete vibra-
tions. The entire interval covered by the visible spectrum would be about a
major fifth ; between line B and line H, or the part easily visible, a major fourth.

§ V. DIFFRACTION. ;

We are now prepared to understand the causes which produce the stripes or
fringes observed by Grimaldi, bordering the shadows of opaque bodies intro-
duced into a divergent pencil of light from a minute radiant point. Let R, Fig.
39, be the radiant centre, and PQ the spherical wave front, at any determinate
distance from I, as RA. In this case, as in the former, and generally in all
analogous experiments, the best radiant for the purpose is obtained by concen-
trating a small solar beam, (introduced into a dark room,) by means of a lens of
short focus. Suppose an opaque screen § to be advanced to A, so as to inter-
cept the half wave AQ. The light which reaches the
point B, in the line RA produced, will be the resultant
effect of the unobstructed half wave PA. Let AQ
be divided, at a, 4, c, &e., into parts, such that the
lines Ba, Bd, Be, &c., drawn from the point B ona
screen BO, to the points of division, may successively
exceed each other by the length of one-half an undu-
lation; or such that, drawing the are AT with B asa
centre, the intercepts aa’, bb’, cc', &c., may have
the successive values $A, A, 34, &c. Now, if the
screen S be drawn upward from A to a, the light which reaches B will be the
resultant effect of the half wave PA, combined with the resultant effect of the
small additional wave surface Aa. This latter resultant will be compounded
of the molecular movements produced at B by the infinite number of minute
elementary waves, which may be supposed to originate from all the points of
the given wave front between A and a. Since all these elementary waves
originate simultaneously, their relative phases, when they reach B, will depend
on the differences in the lengths of their paths; and as these differences are the
intercepts between the arcs AQ and AT, there will be none, until we reach a,
which will differ from the wave proceeding from A by so much as half an undu-
lation. Assuming, then, that their several intensities are equal, there will be no
complete conflict between any of the elementary waves within these limits ; and
accordingly their resultant effect must be positive, or must add to the intensity
of the light at B. If, however, we raise the screen S higher, the intercepts
will begin to exceed half the length of an undulation, and some of the element-
ary Waves originating just beyond a will neutralize the effect of some of those near A.
Raising it to 4, there will be a complete series of waves originating between @
and 6, which will be in absolute conflict with the series which originate between
A and a; so that, if Aa and ad were exactly equal, and their separate intensi-
ties, as above supposed, equal also, their resultant ‘effect at B would be zero.
Aa is, however, a little larger than ad, both because of the inclination of Ba
to BA, and because of the curvature of AQ. ‘The intensities of the elementary
derivative waves are also presumed to be greater in the direction of the radius
of the original wave than in directions inclined to it, though the law of such
variation of intensity is not known. These causes of difference will, neverthc-
less, exist to no very marked degree in the immediate vicinity of the line RB,
and consequently the total effect at B of the portion of wave front Ad will be sen-
sibly null. If, now, the screen S be further raised to c, the elementary waves

DIFFRACTION—GRIMALDI'S FRINGES. 173

originating between b and c will be in complete conflict with those between a
and 6. ‘Thus the power of ad to interfere with Aa will be nearly neutralized,
and the point B will receive, once more, nearly all the illumination which Aa
is capable of sending to it. And in like manner, if the screen be successively
raised to the points d, e, &c., similar alternations of diminished and increased
brightness may be inferred. After passing the fifth or seventh division, how-
ever, these successive maxima and minima cease to be perceptible in white light :
a consequence partly due to the unequal lengths of the undulations of the differ-
ent colors, and partly to the diminishing length and increasing obliquity of the
successive divisions of the wave front.

Dr. Lloyd has illustrated this case in the following felicitous manner. Let
the light received at B from the half wave PA be represented by 1, and that
from the total unobstructed wave by 2. Represent the effect of Aa by +m,
that of ab by —m’', that of dc by +m", and so on. Then we have, ;

2=14 m—m! +m"'—ml"", &e.

Now as each of the successive literal terms is greater than that which follows
it, if we cut the series at any point the value of all the terms which succeed on
the right will have the same sign as the first of them; and the sum of the remain-
ing terms on the left will be less than 2 if the value cut off is positive, and
greater than 2 if the value cut off is negative.

Should these popular illustrations of a somewhat difficult subject appear un-
satisfactory, it may be observed that analysis leads to the same results, although
the processes are complicated. Without going into details, we may remark
that the intercept aa’ is evidently a function of the angle ARa. Put % for the
intercept, » for the angle, and V for the resultant molecular velocity at B.
Then, if all the derivative waves begin simultaneously in the are AQ, the com-
ponent molecular velocity at B, due to any elementary wave will be expressed by

vsin2a-, .dw; v being the maximum molecular velocity of the derivative wave,

and A the length of an undulation. Hence—

As fiw), which is the intercept, is always increasing with , and its differ-
ential coeflicient also, this expression makes it evident that the value of V
must pass through a series of maxima and minima, since the expression

1—cos22l¥) undulates between the values 0 and 2. These maxima and minima

become, moreover, less marked as w increases, since F(w), whatever it may be,
must increase also.

This illustration, however, excludes an important consideration, which is,
that, owing to the constantly increasing obliquity of the are w to the direction

and of the intercept itself. When » has any considerable magnitude, this

factor rapidly reduces the value of = 5 indicating a similarly rapid diminu-
Aw

tion in the fluctuations of value of the integral. On the other hand, when w

is very small, this factor may be regarded as a constant, and assumed, without

sensible error, as equal to unity.

The distance of these fringes from the boundary of the shadow may be de-
termined as follows. Suppose the screen § to be at a, and let the straight line
RaC be the boundary of the geometrical shadow. Draw aN perpendicular to

¥rom this expression, which is the equation of an hyperbola, it appears that,
if the screen B move toward A, the /ocus of all the points in space correspond-

ilar inference may be drawn from considering that, in all positions of the

RA+BA—Ba, or RB—Ba—RA—}, which is also constant. But this
is the property of a hyperbola whose foci (not the vertices) are It and
a,and whose major axis is r—4A. This latter result is the strictly correct
one. The discrepancy between it and the former is owing to the omission of
minute terms in obtaining that result. Put the major axis equal A, and the
minor axis equal B. Then, by the law of the hyperbola,

Be=7?— A? = 7? — (r — 31) = rl —47"; or B= Vr,

which, when the minute terms are dismissed, simplifies itself to the expression
found before.

The semi-axis major of this curve being 47—J, it appears that the curve
itself passes behind the obstructing edge at the distance of 44, at which distance
a wave reflected from the obstacle would meet a wave advancing with a differ-
ence of $4. Whether this theoretic indication is actually realized, it would
perhaps be difficult experimentally to determine. Such a reflected wave, con-
sidering only the difference of path, would be out of harmony with the advancing
wave; but, considering that its molecular movements would be reversed by
reflection from the dense ether of the obstacle, the harmony would be restored.

For the distance of the second fringe from the shadow, the expression already

The second hyperbola passes at the distance of #4 behind the obstructing edge,
and the third at the distance of $4. Owing to the great disproportion between
the axes, 7—#4, and YrA—4/?, which are very nearly in the ratio of V7: VA,
the curvature is very slight except for a short distance from the vertex; so that
the branches in fact sensibly coincide with their asymptotes. But near the vertex
the curvature is very decided.

evident that when the obstruction
presents a salient angle instead of a

round the angle in circular ares, instead
of making an angle also. Indeed, the

Fig. 40. angles of 90° or less, the fringes cross
each other without interference, and
are continued up to the edge of the shadow on each side of the angle. These
are casily seen to be necessary consequences of the theory of their formation.
The annexed figure exhibits the phenomena.

When the obstructing body is large, no f.inges are seen within the shadow.
Some light strays beyond the geometrical boundary of the shadow, but it rapidly
fades away, and produces no very sensible effects. If, however, a very narrow
object be employed, the waves from opposite sides may mingle and interfere.
In this case fringes or stripes will be scen within the shadow. The light con-
cerned in producing these fringes comes from the portion of the main wave
which is c'ose to the obstruction, as the more distant parts of cach half wave
will hold each other in check in the manner heretofore explained. Points being
taken at a, 6, ¢, a’, b,c, &e., such that the succes-
sive differences of distance of these points from B
may be $2, we shall have, on each side, a series of
resultant actions alternately positive and negative, as
illustrated in the foregoing case, such as—

+ m—m! + m!!—ml"'4-m'""', &e.

And as the effect of any portion of this series, left
by cutting off terms from the beginning, depends on
the sign of the first of the remaining terms—that is
to say, as the effect due to the first of these terms
exceeds the joint effect of all that follow—it is evident that no part of the main
wave can have anything to do with producing fringes in the shadow, ex-
cept Ca and Aa’. And since there can be no fringes produced at all, unless
the light from both sides reaches the same point, the centre of the shadow, which
is equidistant from the edges of the obstacle—that is, from the front of the
main wave—must exhibit alight stripe. On each side of this will be found posi-
tions, as for instance B’, where the distances from A and © differ by half an
undulation; and here the darkniss will be complete. At distances a little greater
will be found positions where the differences of distance from A and C amount
to an entire undulation; and here will be found once more bright stripes. If the
object be very narrow, these interferences may occur not only throughout all

the shadow, but to some distance into the light on each side. Should any evi-
dence seem to be needed to confirm the theory on which the formation of these
fringes has been explained, it may be found in the fact that if, by an interposed
card, the light from one side of the opaque object be arrested, all the fringes
will instantly disappear from the shadow.

As for the form of the /oct of these fringes in space, since each is determined
by the intersection of radii from A and C, having a constant difference, they are
necessarily hyperbolas, having A and C for their foci. But in this case it is the
principal axis which is small, while the conjugate axis is comparatively very
great; so that the curves are widely open, having but slight curvature even at
their vertices.

Let B/A—B’/C=2x 44, n being any integral number, even or edd. It is
evident, from the law of the hyperbola, that 3x is the principal axis of the
trajectory of B’. And, putting CA=c, the conjugate axis will be Y¥?—jn*?.

curve gives us—

According to the notation heretofore used, y, which is the distance of B from
the object AC, may be replaced by s. Also c’, in the numerator under the
radical, may be dropped without appreciable error, except when B is quite near

to the object. The simplified expression will then be— :

By substituting different numerical values for x, this equation serves for all
the fringes, light or dark. ‘The even numbers give the loci of the bright stripes,
and the odd those of the dark. The distance 0 is in all cases measured from
the middle of the central bright stripe.

The expression for the value of 6 indicates, at sight, that the fringes will
increase in breadth, as the opaque intercepting object diminishes in diameter.
In fact, 0 is inversely as ec, and to double the
breadth of the fringes, we have only to reduce
the diameter of the object one-half. Accord-
ingly, if a tapering object, as a sewing needle.
be employed, the fringes will spread out toward
the top with a beautiful plumose appearance.
This becomes still more striking when the taper
is is more rapid, as when we use an acute-angled

Fig. 42. or even a right-angled plate of thin metal. ‘The
fringes, which in this case are very remarkable, have been called Grimaldi’s
crests. .

DIFFRACTION BY MINUTE APERTURES. Ad’,

The next case which presents itself is that in which a small portion of the
wave only is allowed to pass through a narrow opening in the obstructing
screen, having straight and parallel sides. In this case a position may be found
for the screen B, in which, if RAB (Fig. 43) be
drawn from the radiant through the centre of the
aperture, Ba and Ba’, drawn from B to the edges,
may exceed BA by one-half an undulation. All
lines drawn from B to points of the wave front
nearer to A than aor @’, will differ from BA less
than half an undulation, and the point B will be
fully enlightened. If then the screen B be advanced
toward A, there will be found somewhere another
position in which Ba and Ba' will exceed BA

Fig. 43. by an entire undulation. The spaces Aa, Aa’,
may then be divided somewhere, so that lines drawn from the points of
division to B shall once more differ from BA by half an undulation. All the
molecular movements excited at B by the segments next to A will then be in
conflict with those which are generated by the segments next to a and a’; and accord-
ingly in this position of B the middle of the luminous image will be occupied
by a dark stripe. By advancing B still nearer, another point may be found,
where Ba and Ba’ will differ from BA by three halves of an undulation; and
in this case the ares Aa and Aq’ may be divided each into three parts, such that
the distances of the points of division from B may successively exceed each
other by half an undulation. The pair next to @ and the pair next to a’ will
then neutralize each other, while the central pair will be efficient, and the point
B will be again illuminated. Thus, by varying the distance of B from a, the
dark stripe in the centre of the luminous image will alternately appear and dis-
appear. It is obvious, however, that when the distance is fcund at which
Ba—BA is exactly one-half an undulation, the dark stripe will not return at any
greater distance. As the screen B approaches A, on the other hand, the entire
bright image becomes filled up with fringes, increasing in number, with the
central one alternately dark and bright. It is also sufficiently remarkable and
striking that if, when B is at the maximum distance producing a dark centre, a
very narrow opaque object be placed over the aperture, parallel to its edges, so
as to intercept exactly one-half the light, leaving equal portions on each side of
it to pass, the brightness of the centre will instantly return. It will disappear
again when the opaque object is removed. When B is at other positions nearer
to A, producing the dark centre, the restoration of central brightness will not
necessarily take place on cutting out the central half of the beam; but it may
be effected by cutting out a portion which is somewhat more or less than half.

In order to understand the conditions upon which this difference depends, we
must consider that the dark stripe appears in the centre only when La—BA is
equal to an even number of half undulations. But even numbers of two kinds,
the even-even, and the odd-even.. The even-even are all of them multiples of
2 by the arithmetical series of even numbers 2, 4, 6, &e.; the odd-even are mul-
tuples of 2 by the odd numbers 1, 3.5, &e. If, then, Bea—BA—nx d,, the light
will be restored to the central dark stripe by stopping out the middle half of the
beam, whenever » is an odd-even number; and the interposed opaque body
must exceed or fall short of half the breadth of the beam by the breadth of two,
at least, of the divisions of the wave front, (2z in all,) into which the space aa!
is Supposed, in the foregoing explanation, to be divided, in order to restore the
brightness when x is an even-even number. We here assume the several divi-

178 UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT.

sions of the wave front to be equal in extent, which is sufficiently exact for the
purpose in view. The other dark stripes which form
within the bright image of the opening aa’ are sub-
ject to fluctuations of intensity similar to those of the
central one. ‘lo understand this, let 6 be a point so

far as this portion of the wave is concerned, the

point J will be obscure in every position of & which

preserves this relation, whatever be the distance from

A. Also, at any distance of 4 for which the divisions

» Fig. 44. of the wave front ac, made as heretofore described,

are an even number on each side of Rd, the whole effect of the wave at & will

be null, and the point 4 will be obscure. But if the number of these divisions

on each side of R& be an odd number, there will be a portion of the wave un-
neutralized, and 4 will be illuminated. :

The fringes exterior to the bright image of the opening are more beautiful
than those interior to it, being, especially when the aperture is very narrow,
richly colored. They are not subject to the fluctuations of brightness, as the
distance of B from the aperture varies, which attend the interior fringes; since
the lines da and ba’, drawn to any point in any of those fringes from @ and a’,
the limits of the aperture, will be both on the same side of Ré.

The distances 0 from the central line B are all determined by the same
equation which was found for the fringes formed by a narrow opaque object.
Indeed, the geometrical conditions in the present case are identically the same
as those in that. he optical difference is, that the even values of 2 give the
loct of the dark stripes, and the odd those of the bright. The breadths vary,
as before, inversely as ec, which is the diameter or width of the aperture. With
apparatus in which the opposed edges are movable, the expansion of the
fringes, as these edges are made gradually to approach each other, is very
striking. When the aperture is a very slender isosceles triangle, they spread out
widely toward the vertex. The expression,

R

=

patet
2c

also shows that the breadth varies directly as the length of the undulation. © In
homogeneous light, therefore, the broadest fringes are obtained with red, and
the narrowest with violet. In such light, a dozen or twenty may easily be
counted. When white light is employed, the overlapping of the colors, while
it improves the beauty of the display, reduces very much the number that can
be distinguished. When monochromatic light eannot conveniently be obtained,
the same effects may be substantially produced by viewing the fringes made by
white light through colored glasses.

When, instead of a long and narrow aperture, a small circular opening in an
opaque plate is used, the fringes are, of course, circular. In this case, the cen-
tral dark stripe of the preceding experiment becomes a central dark round spot.
This spot disappears and reappears as the screen is brought nearer the plate, at
the same distances at which this effect was observed in the-central stripe in the
image of the oblong aperture. Referring to the last figure, and regarding aa!
as the diameter of the circular opening, when Ba—BA=2 x3), there will be
some point between a and A (suppose a’) which, if joined to B, will give
Ba” —BA=32. Now, it has been shown that Ba—BA varies as y’; the radius
of the aperture (or of the part of it considered) being represented by y. Hence,
for the point supposed, a”, we have Aa@?=A2a'”; or the circle of which Aa is
DIFFRACTION OF OPAQUE DISK. 179

the radius, is double in area of the circle of which Aq” is the radius. But since
Ba—Ba"'=3A, and Ba” —BA=d,, it is obvious that the resultant molecular
movement produced at B by the circle of which Aa” is the radius, will be in
total conflict with that produced at the same point by the portion of wave front
which forms the ring between this circle and the circumference of the orifice. It
is this conflict which produces the dark spot at B. If now a small opaque disk
could be introduced into the middle of the orifice, exactly equal to the circle Aa”,
stopping out the central pencil of light, B would immediately become bright
again.

If Ba—BA=4x #, the circular aperture will be made up of a central
circle and ¢hrce concentric rings, of equal areas, producing movements at B
alternately equal and opposite. B will accordingly be obscure. If we stop out
now one-half the area in the middle—that is to say, the central circle and the
first ring—B will still be obscure; but if we stop out the central circle and the
two interior rings, the light at B will be restored. Or if we stop the central
circle only, or, instead of that, the exterior ring, or (which is the same thing)
apply over the aperture a smaller one, having only three-fourths the area of the
first—in either case the light will be restored. But if we stop the central circle
and the outer ring a¢ the same time, B will remain ovscure.

Generally, if Ba—BA=x x $A, m having any integral even value, the centre
of the bright image of the aperture will be dark. If'z be odd-even, stopping
out one-half the area from the middle of the aperture will restore the light. If
n be even-even, stopping out one-half the area will produce no change ; but the
light may be restored by stopping a portion of the area which is by a certain
amount greater, or by the same amount less, than one-half. In all these cases
the light at the centre, when restored, will be sensibly equal in intensity to that
which would reach B through an orifice of the size which would give
Ba"—BA=3,.

This incidentally leads us to the remarkable result that if, in this experiment,
instead of a circular aperture in an opaque plate, we employ an opaque disk
attached to a transparent plate, ‘the centre of the shadow will be as highly
illuminated as it would be if the wave were not interrupted at all. For an open
circle whose centre and circumference give the relation Ba’—BA=3#), and
a ring whose exterior and interior circumferences give Ba—Bu'’—$)/, pro-
duce sensibly the same illumination at B. In either case all the remaining ob-
structed portion of the wave exterior to them may be divided into rings, whose
relation to the unobstructed part will be alternately negative and positive,
and whose total resultant (which takes the sign of the first term) will be op-
posed to that of the unobstructed portion. If then this exterior portion be
allowed to pass, the etiect, in either case equally, will be somewhat to diminish
the intensity of the brightness at B, which brightness therefore will still remain
equal for the circle and for the ring. But in the first instance, this is to allow
the entire wave to pass; while in the second it leaves the disk. ‘The centre of
the shadow of ihe disk, therefore, which is the point B, is as much illuminated
as the same point is when the wave is wholly unobstructed. ‘This curious cir-
curnstance, wh'ch was first announced by Poisson from theoretic considerations,
is easily verified by experiment.

When it is said that an open circle which gives at its centre and its circum-
ference the relation Ba’—BA—x x $/, ora ring of which the outer and inner
circumferences furnish a similar relation, will exhibit a dark spot at B whenever
m is an integral even number, it must be remembered that this proposition is
true only of the rays whose undulation lengthis 2. If 2 is the undulation length
of the red rays, and 2! that of the blue or violet, then at the distance at which
red disappears, the blue or violet will not be entirely suppressed. We have

seen that Ba'—BA has a value expressed by the formula A= 5
rs

y”, y being the
radius of the circle. This may be resolved into the paris,

ya

2r Qs’
of which the first is constant when y is constant, and the second varies inversely
as s, which is the distance BA. ‘The less the value of 2 (=n x 42), the greater
will be the distance at which the color corresponding to 2 will be suppressed.
And as the color which remains is the difference between the color suppressed
and white, it follows that, as the eye approaches A, in the line BA, the ring or
the aperture will assume successively all the tints of the spectrum from red up-
ward, and that this series may be several times repeated. Moreover, putting A
for the length of the red, and i’ for the mean length of undulation in the com-
pound color complementary to red, which will correspond nearly to the wave
length in the green, when Ba’—BA=—(2n+1) X$4' <(2u+1) x $4, a point }
may be found on any side of A, but very near it, at which 6a’—bA—(2n+1) x44.
A green circle will therefore appear surrounding A, while A itself, whether
it be an aperture or a ring, will be red. Also, at other distances, greater or less,
circles of other tints will appear; so that the ring or aperture will be encircled by
a corona displaying all the prismatic colors, from red to violet, shading outward.

As the eye approaches A, the equation da’—bA=(2n+1) X42 will be true of
points nearer and nearer to B, until 4 and B coincide. 'The rings will therefore
appear to be successively absorbed into the aperture. In withdrawing the eye, they
will seem to be, in like manner, evolved out of it. In this experiment the aperture
should be very small or the ring very narrow, in order that the tints may be vivid.

It will readily be understood that the obscurity and the sharp edges of shadows
of bodies of considerable size are owing to the smallness of the values of 2 for
all the rays of light. On this account, if any point be taken within the line of
the geometrical shadow, and if the wave front, beginning at the edge of the
opaque body, be divided into portions whose extremes are remote from that
point by distances differing $2, these portions will neutralize each other’s effects,
except for positions of the assumed point for which the divisions have (as they
may near the shadowing body) some slight inequality, and no material obliquity.
Such positions can only be found very near the line of the geometrical shadow.

To the same cause it is owing that, in
refraction and reflection, the beam re-
fracted or reflected is as sharply defined
as the incident beam. ‘The demonstration
which we have given of these effects, from
Huyghens, contains an imperfection on
this point, which I'resnel has supplied.
Referring to the figure, suppose that an
undulation originating at b should take
the direction BA, different from that of
the main reflected wave, BQ’. There

Vig. 33. will always be found, to the left of B, a
point, as 7, from which another undulation will follow in the parallel and nearly
coincident line xh, differing from the first by half an undulation. Draw wo per-
pendicular to BB’ and Be perpendicular to 2h; onB is the angle of incidence.
Put p for xBé. Then Bo=Bn sin:, and xt—Bz.sinp.

Now, when the wave whose front is Bé starts from 2, the movement which is
to produce the wave from Bis ato. There will accordingly be interference, if
nt—Bo—3A; that is, if Bu.(sine—sin:)—=$4. But since 4 is very small, if sinp
sensibly exceed sint, Bn will be very small; showing that interference will
take place from a point very near B. As sing approaches sins, the distance of
the origin of the iuterfering wave will be greater; but there will de an interfering

wave, (if the surface AB is unlimited,) in every case except that in which
sinp—=sin ¢; that is, in which Bé coincides in direction with the regularly re-
flected wave. ;

In like manner, in the case of refraction, if we suppose a wave to diverge in
the direction Br, draw ng parallel to Br and Bp perpendicular to it. Call the
angle nBp, p, as before. Then Bo=Bu.sin:, and xmp—Bn.sinp. But np being
the path of a wave in the denser medium, it must be multiplied by the index of
refraction, in order to obtain the equivalent distance, or distance which the wave
would have moved in the same time, in the rarer. Let x be the index of re-
fraction, and we have, for the condition of interference, By.(msinp—sin:)—=dA.
If nsinp is sensibly greater than sins, Bx must be very small. And for any
value of xsinp—sin:, there will be a distance Bx furnishing a wave of inter-
ference, if the surface AB is unlimited; except only for the value xsinp—sin:—0,
when the ray Br ceases to diverge from the direction of the main refracted wave.

These reasonings assume that the forces of the elementary derivative waves
are the same in all directions. But it is probable that these forces are less in
lines oblique to the direction of progress of the primitive wave than iz that di-
rection. How far this is true could be casily investigated experimentally, by
employing apertures less than the length of a haJf undulation in diameter, were
it not that the extreme minuteness of such apertures (the mean length of a half
undulation not exceeding one one-hundred-thousandth of an inch) would render
the light too feeble for the purpose.

Some material for the formation of an opinion on this subject may, however,
be gathered from certain phenomena of diftraction first observed by Fraunhofer,
more remarkable and more brilliant than any which have been thus far men-
tioned. If a single very minute aperture will not furnish light enough for
experiment, an assemblage of very many very minute apertures, closely grouped,
may do so; and if these be so arranged that, for any determinate point in the
shadow, they shall allow only such portions of the wave front to pass as conspire
in their effects at that point, while the intervals between them obstruct those
portions which conflict, we shall possibly find that the tendency of a wave
originating in a single molecular impulse to expand equally in all directions, is
much more decided than had been supposed. Fraunhofer’s original experiments
were made with gratings formed by stretching an exceedingly fine wire across
two parallel screws of a great number of threads to the inch—the threads
serving to keep the wires equidistant. He subsequently employed gratings
formed by cementing leaves of gold to glass and cutting them through in very
fine parallel lines ruled with a sharp instrument. Instead of these, also, he
employed similar lines ruled with a diamond on glass itself.

The results of such an arrangement may easily be predicted. The image of
an aperture closed by such a grating will appear bright, as though the obstruction
were not interposed. But toward either side, in the direction perpendicular to the
lines of the grating, will be found several points for which the part of the wave
which the grating obstructs would if allowed to pass be more or less in conflict with
those which it transmits; and which, therefore, are bright when the grating is pres-
ent, and dark when it is absent. Suppose, for simplicity, that the open spaces and
the opaque bars are equal in breadth. Let
d, a, a, represent several of these open spaces,
and 4, b, b, &c., the intermediate bars. A
point, P, may be found from which lines being
drawn as in the figure, and perpendiculars le:
fall upon them from the edges of the aper-
tures, as at c, c, d, d, will give cd = $A,
db =4$A, and therefore ch 2. ‘The distances
from P to the corresponding parts of the sev-

Fig 45. eral openings will thus differ by an entire un-
dulation, and beszee the waves which reach P through them will be in harmony.

182 UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT.

The distances from P to the corresponding parts of the obstructing bars will
differ from the distances to the adjacent openings by half an undulation; and,
accordingly, if the bars were removed, the wave which would proceed from those
points would neutralize the effects of the former: but being obstructed, P remains
illuminated by the resultant effect of all the first set of waves.

Furthermore, since the position of P is determined by the condition that cd
shall be the length of an undulation, it will be necessary to take P further from
B for the longer undulations and nearer for the shorter. The different colors
will thus be separated, and a perfect spectrum will be formed on the screen.

Should the point P be taken so that cd is equal to two undulations, there will
be no spectrum: for in this case ed will.be equal to one undulation, and as in
the cases we have considered of a single aperture, one-half of each opening, a,
will hold in check the other half. If we find still another point where dc is
equal to three undulations, then ed will equal one undulation and a half; two-
thirds of each opening will then be neutralized, but the remaining third will be
effective; and there will be another spectrum, but less brilliant than the first.
If dc = four undulations, the spectrum will again fail. If de — 52 it will return,
and so on.

If the bars are broader than the open spaces, there will. be a spectrum for
beni, m being any integral number; until the light is too feeble, or until
cd wd, n! being also any integral number. If the spaces are broader than the
bars, there will be a spectrum for every integral value of min be== nd until

If, however, an is not integral, take g— the greatest common measure of a

Put this value of 2 equal to m, and we may say generally that the mth spectrum
will fail, and also the mmth, m being, as before, any integral number. If @ and
6 are incommensurable, there could be theoretically no perfect spectra, or spectra
of maximum brilliancy; nor would any spectrum absolutely fail: but a near
approach to failure would occur for approximate values of g. All these propo-
sitions result so obviously from the construction above given, that they require no
demonstration.

The same construction indicates a simple expression for the deviation of each
spectrum from the directio.’ RB, of the radius of the original wave. For rep-
resenting this deviation by 0, we have—

will give the number of the first spectrum which will fail.

sind=——. [17.|

Putting » = 1, Aone fifty-thousandth of an inch, the length of the mean
undulation, and supposing one thousand opaque lines to the inch, the formula
gives us, by substitution, sind—0.02—sin 1° 9’. As the sines of small angles
are very nearly proportional to the angles themselves, the deviations of the suc-
ceeding spectra will be nearly the double, triple, &c., of this. And as thé de-
nominator, a+, is the reciprocal of the number of lines to the unit of measure-
ment to which 4 has been referred—in this case to the inch—it is evident that
the sines of the deviations will increase directly as this number. With five
thousand lines to the inch, the fifth spectrum will have a deviation of thirty
degrees. The force of the derivative waves from minute apertures thus appears
to be great even at large obliquities, when the obstructing effects of interference
are removed.

In the above expression for sind, if 2 be put equal to 1, and a6 equal to 4,
COLORS OF THIN PLATES. 183

sind is unity, indicating a deviation of 90°. A grating, therefore, in which the
number of lines to the inch is equal to the number of undulations in the same
space, will produce no spectra. The same is true, @ fortiori, of still finer
gratings.

The spectra formed in this way by diffraction will easily be understood to
form the best of all possible measures of the lengths of the undulations corres-
ponding to the different colors. They exhibit very distinctly the principal lines
of Fraunhofer; and these lines, as might be inferred as a theoretical necessity,
preserve invariably the same relative distances from each other. 'The spectra
formed by refraction afford measures, not of the relative lengths of the undula-
tions in vacuo, but of those lengths as modified by the media of which the
refracting bodies are composed. “App: wently these modifications are not simply
proportional to the lengths of the undulations. Mr. Cauchy’s investigations
upon dispersion show, as we have scen, that they ought not to be.

Light veflected from finely ruled surfaces exhibits colors, as well as that which
is transmitted through them. These efiects are produced by interference, and
are explained upon principles analogous to those we have been considering.
Some substances are naturally marked with sinuosities which produce these
effects. A familiar example of this kind is seen in mother of pearl. Sir David
Brewster found that an impression of the polished surface of this material taken
in wax, exhibited the same colors as the substance itself.

The effects produced by diffraction may be endlessly varied, by employing
(instead of gratings) reticulations, and groups of apertures, of various figures,
symmetrically disposed. Many of the phenomena are exceedingly rich and
beautiful. We must content ourselves with the examples which have been
given, and which illustrate the general principles on which they all depend.

§ VI. COLORS OF THIN PLATES.

We will now proceed, very briefly, to apply the theory of undulation to the
explanation of the colors seen in thin transparent plates ; or, as they are com-
monly called, Newton’s rings. These, when scen by reflected light, are caused
by the interference of the wave which proceeds from the lower surface of the
plate with that which is reflected by the upper. Let us suppose, at first, for
simplicity, that the light employed is homogeneous. Where the dark rings
occur, there must be a difference of path between the interfering waves, of one-
half an undulation. Now the wave which is reflected from the lower surface,
passes through the thin plate twice; and that which is reflected trom the upper
surface does not enter the plate. - The difference of path is therefore twice
the thickness of the plate; and this ought apparently to be equal to half an un-
dulation, or to some uneven multiple of half an undulation. Let @ represent
the thickness, and » any integral number; then—

20==(2n4+-1)x4A: and when n=—=0, 204), or 0= HA.

Tt should seem, accordingly, that the first dark ring should appear, where the
thickness is equal to one-quarter ef the length of an undulation. As the thickness
increases toward 0=-5/, or diminishes tue 0=0, the light should gradually
appear; aud when cither of these valucs is reached, we should have the maximun of
brightness. The centre of the system should then be bright. It is not so, how-
ever, but on the other hand is entirely dark. The reason of this apparent dis-
Coetnnice with theory will be understood, when we recall the circumstance,
thus far disregarded, that the reflection at the lower surface takes place as
the ray is proeceding from a rarer to a denser medium; while that at the
first surface occurs as the ray is passing from a denser and to a rarer.
It has been already shown that, in the latter of these cases, the molecular move-
ments maintain their original directions; while in the former, these movements
184 UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT.

are reversed. But to reverse the molecular movements of a wave is to change
its phase half an undulation. Accordingly, at the points where 0=}A, and
where the difference of path is $A, the difference of phase is $A+42=2. This
thickness should accordingly give a bright ring, and not a dark one; and so it
is in fact observed to do.

If there could be any hesitation about receiving this explanation of the
phenomenon, it may be entirely removed by considering the following two
experiments. My. Babinet having produced, by means of Fresnel’s mirrors, the
fringes of interference already described, recived the interfering pencils upon
a glass mirror, of which one half was transparent and the other half silvered
on the back. The reflected pencils, thrown upon a screen, still exhibited the
fringes. When both the pencils were reflected from the silvered part of the -
mirror, or both from-the transparent part, the fringe in the middle continued to
be bright, as in Fresnel’s original experiment. But when one of the pencils
was reflected from the transparent glass and the other from the metal, the middle
fringe became immediately dark. "The other experiment alluded to consists in
introducing between the two lenses, in Newton’s experiment, a fluid having a
refracting power intermediate between that of the upper and that of the lower
glass. With a crown glass above, having the index 1.5, and a flint glass beneath,
with the index 1.575, the oil of sassafras (index 1.53) or that of claves s (index
1.539) introduced between will convert the dark rings into bright ones, and vice
versa. In this case the rays, at both surfaces alike, are passing from a rarer to
a denser medium.

When the rings are viewed by oblique light the undulatory theory requires
that their apparent magnitudes should be governed by the following law. If
MM’ be the upper of two glass plates, with par-
allel surfaces, enclosing a lamina of air between
them, and if IPQSTVR be the path of a ray
incident obliquely at P, and reflected at the lower
surface of the lamina at the point §S, this will fall
= in at T with another, reflected from the upper

ae surface at T, whose path is NOTVR. When
ey the first is at P the other is at N, in PN, drawn
from P perpendicularly to NO. These two have the same length of path in
the medium MM’. Their difference of path will therefore be QS+ST_NO,
or 2ST—NO. As the angle NPO is equal to the angle of incidence (which
put == ¢,) and also KST, we shall have—

appears Is greater than at a perpendicular incidence, in the ratio of ‘the secant
of ineidence to unity, or in the inverse ratio of the cosine of incidence to unity.
But this is the law which observation had established before the theory of
undulation had indicated its necessity.

There is still one point to be attended to before the theory of the phenomenon
is complete. The dark rings, as seen by reflection in homogeneous light, are

absolutely dark, showing that the interference is total. But the amount ‘of light
COLORS OF THIN PLATES. 185

in the two conflicting rays ought to be equal in order to produce this effect. Now,
if we assume (what will hereafter be proved) that the amount of light reflected
at either surface is in a constant ratio to the amount of light inc ident upon it,
when the angle of incidence and the index of refraction are ‘themselves constant,
we shall perceive that the ray which emerges after one reflection at the lower
surface is feebler than that which is reflected at the upper: for the light incident
upon the lower is already enfeebled by the loss at the upper, and the reflected
ray is again diminished by the second reflection which occurs at its emergence
through | the upper. But the light which is thus turned back at the upper surface
is again reflected at the lower, and at its return another portion emerges through
the upper. A series of reflections thus goes on between the two surf: 2CeS, each
one contributing to strengthen the emergent ray; and the resultant of all these
contributions is to bring the ray from the lower surface, in the end, up to exact
equality with that which is originally reflected from the upper without entering
the lamina. This will appear to be rigidly true if we consider the following
statement. ‘he intensity of light is measured by the living force which ani-
mates the mass of ether in which the molecular movements are going on. Let
the masses in the two adjacent strata of the two media which act upon each
other be distinguished by the letters m for the denser and m! for the rarer. Now
it is true (as will hereafter be proved) that the velocity of molecular movement
in a wave reflected from the separating surface of two given media, at a given
incidence, bears a determinate ratio to the molecular v elocity i in the incident wave.
Let this be represented by the ratio v: 1, the incident velocity being unity.
Then the living force of the reflected wave will be mz?, and that whic hh passes
into the sag me dium and forms the transmitted wave will be m(1—z?). Ac-

cordingly ~~ “(le ) is the square of the molecular velocity in the transmitted

wave. ee it be represented by «’.

By reflection at the second surface, w becomes ew, and this, by another reflee-
tion of the returning wave at the first surface, becomes vz. From the living
force of the wave returning from the second surface subtract the living foree
which it loses by the second reflection at the first, and the remainde xv, which is

the living force transmitted through the first surface, will be m'v?u? (L—v?).

And this, divided by the mass m, gives mew (1—v”) for the square of the first

component of the molecular velocity in the wave which reaches the eye from the
second surface. In like manner v7 becomes vw by second reficction at the
second surface; and v*u becomes v*u by the eceediae reflection at the first
surface. And the expression for the aa of the second component of the

By substituting ‘the value of wv, taki ing the square roots of these squares and

from the second surface, equal to v’, we shall obtain—

two surfaces, are equal.

It is assumed in the foregoing that all these components agree in phase. But
this is evidently true at the points where the dark rings, as seen by reflection,
appear. For at these points the first return wave from the lower surface is in

conflict with the advancing wave, which it meets at the first surface. This
advancing wave does not change its phase by refraction, but the reflected part
of the return wave does so, and is therefore in harmony with the advancing
wave which it joins. The two accordingly conspire from that time forward ;
their emergent portions at the second surface producing a bright ring by trans-
mitted light, while their reflected portions, returning to the first surface, conflict
with the zext advancing wave which they mect there.

But at the points where the drzght reflected rings appear, the case is different.
The return wave is in harmony with the advancing wave which it meets at the
first surface, and its emergent part conspires with the reflected part of the
advancing wave. But its reflected part, losing half an undulation, conflicts with
the transmitted part of the advancing wave, and thus produces, by subsequent
transmission through the second surface, a ring partinly obscure, but not entirely
so, from the great inequality of the conflicting molecular velocities. If we
disregard the successive advancing waves, and consider the successive values of
the terms vz, v"v, 7u, &e., at these points, proceeding from a single original
wave, we shall find them alternately positive and negative. Their emergent parts
must be so likewise. And since they are decreasing, their sum takes the sign
of the first term, which is positive; so that their resultant conspires with the
wave reflected to the eye from the first surface. The components, simultaneously
reflected to the second surface from the ‘first, form a similar series with signs
reversed, and therefore have a negative resultant, conflicting with the wave
emergent at that surface.*

* This matter may perhaps be made more clear as follows:

Calling, as above, wu the value of the molecular movement in the ray transmitted through
the first surface, and v the ratio of reflected to incident light, the advancing and returning
waves within the lamina will have the successive molecular velocities—

1. Advancing wave, uw, UU, vu, vou, eu, &e.
2, Returning wave, vu, vu, vu, vu, &e.
And the squares of the velocities of the emergent components will be—

Consider the movement in the incident wave to be positive. Then if the lamina were
without thickness, the successive reflections still going on, the sign of the movement in the
diminished waves successively emergent would ke always positive for the second surface,
(for which the number of reversals by reflection is always even, ) and always negative for the
first, (for which the number of similar reversals is always odd.)

By giving greater or less thickness to the lamina, any difference of path may be introduced
for either the rays seen by reflection or those seen by transmission. If @ represent the thick-
ness, the differences of path which wiil exist, after the several successive reflections, will be
20, 40, 60, or generally 2m0, m being any integral number. If G=2 X dA, or ZO=2n X fA=—nd,
2 being also any integral number, it is manifest that 2m$=mn2, being a number of complete
undulations, cannot change the sign of the movement, whether 2 be even or odd.

But if 26==(2n--1) X}A, then 2mP=m(2n--1) x 4A will be an odd number of half undula-
tions when m is odd, and an even number of half undulations, or an integral number of
complete undulations, when m is even. Accordingly, the wave changes its sign for every
odd value of m.

Hence, if 26=n2, or =n XA, the movement will be negative for all component waves
emergent from the first surface, and positive for all emergent from th

he second.
Also, for 26=(2u-+1)X4A, or 6=(2n-+1) XFA, the signs will be alternately positive and
negative at the first surface, and negative and positive at the second.

For the first case, if we take the square roots of the squares of the’ emergent components
given above, substituting the value of z, we shall have for the resultant v’ at the first surface,
p'=(v2—1).(v--v3-Lv5....ad inf.) Whence v'=—2.

The interference is therefore absolute, and the rings formed at these thicknesses will be per-
fectly dark. :
For the rays emergent at the second surface we obtain the expression—

w/=(1—v2).(1-e?-+et....ad inf. )=—08), a,

COLORS OF THICK PLATES. 187

In these explanations we have supposed the incidence perpendicular, and
have regarded the faces of the laminw as parallel. In the case of Newton’s
rings, neither of these suppositions is usually true; and the second can never
be so. The inclination of the faces is not, however, great enough sensibly to
affect the conclusions. In the case of oblique incidence, it is obvious that no
ray reflected from the second surface can return to the same point of the first
surface (supposed parallel) at which it entered. But the loss occasioned by
this deviation is made good by the reflected component of some other ray
parallel to the first, in the plane of incidence and on the other side of it rela-
tively to the point of emergence.

It will thus be seen that the colors of thin plates, for which, on the theory of
emission, it is difficult to assign a cause which does not introduce as many dif-
ficulties as it removes, are all necessary consequences, on the undulatory theory,
of the simple principle of interference. 'The hypothesis devised by Newton to
account for them has not been presented, since it is now generally abandoned,
and the limits of these lectures would not allow its introduction.

The colors of thick plates, of which some examples were noticed in the intro-
ductory lecture, depend on causes similar to those above explained. In the
case iustrated in Fig. 8, which we here introduce again for the sake of the
explanation, if the light entering at 0 be composed of rays
perfectly parallel, and be reiurned from the spherical sil-
vered glass mirror, by a perfect specular reflection, to the
perforated screen ¢, placed at the centre of curvature, it
will all of it pass through the perforation toward 0, and
no rings will appear; or at least only such as might be

Fig. 8. due to the diffraction of the aperture, very much enfeebled
by the reflection. But if the first surface of the glass be
imperfectly polished, the specular reflection will not be perfect, but there will
be a reflected cone of scattered light at the first incidence. This has nothing
to do with the phenomenon. There will, however, be also a transmitted cone
of scattered light, which will become at the second surface a reflected cone,
having a virtual apex behind the mirror. Moreover, the light transmitted and
subsequently reflected regularly, will, at its emergence after reflection, form a
second scattered cone, the rays of which will have a virtual origin behind the
mirror, though the apex of this cone is at the first surface. The condition of
the light of these two cones is easily seen to be such as to produce interference ;
hence the formation of the rings observed in the experiment.

That is to say, the brightness of these transmitted rings is equal to that of the incident light.
In the second case, the equation for the first surface is,
v'=(1—2?).(v—v3--v— 07... .ad inf.)
This may be separated into two equations, thus:
Put v’=w-+w’,
Also w=(1—v?).(o--v°-++v9-+-013_.. ad inf.)
And w/=(v?—1).(v3--v7--vl! +015... ad inf.)
Then wary) wr sland wpulao'ao
ine value is positive, and shows that the rings by reflection at these thicknesses will be
right.
At the second surface, for the same thicknesses, we shall have,
u/==(1—v?).(1—v?-+- 0105... .ad inf.).
And, by proceeding as before,

w—-w'=u'=—_— E

Showing that the rings scen at these thicknesses by transmitted light are obscure, but not
dark, because u’, which embraces all the light transmitted, Las still a value,
188 UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT.

In the other case, it will be observed that the rays I and I’ undergo repeated
reflections between the surfaces of the plates—a
portion of the light escaping and being transmitted
at each reflection. If the plates are of perfectly
equal thickness and all the surfaces perfectly par-
allel, there will be no interference. Suppose, how-
ever, that one of them is slightly thicker than the
other. Then, if we attend first to the transmitted
rays, T’, T’, we shall see that the path of T, after
incidence and up to final emergence, is made up of
three times the thickness of the first plate, once
the thickness of the second, and once the distance between the plates. Put 6
for the first thickness, 0’ for the second, 6 for the distance between, and L for
the length of path. Then—

Fig. 9.

—=36-F6!--o.

Tracing back 'T’ in the same way, and denoting its length of path by L’', we
have—
L'=0+36!-+6.
Hence L’/—L=2(6’—0).

And when this value is so small as to be comparable to the absolute thicknesses
which produce the colors of Newton’s rings, similar colors may be seen here.

If we attend to the reflected rays R and R’, we shall see (employing the same
notation as before) that—

L==40--20:
Li=20+20'+20.
Hence L’/—-L—2 (0'—0), as before.

It will be noticed that there are other rays, as 7 and ¢, which do not form tints,
their differences of path, as compared with R, R’, or with T, T’, being too great.

§. VII —POLARIZATION BY REFLECTION AND BY REFRACTION.

We will now proceed to give a physical theory of the phenomenon called
polarization of light, and of its production by reflection and refraction. It has
already been hinted that the phenomenon itself consists in the determination of
the molecular movements in the suecession of undulations which constitutes a
ray or beam of light, to one constant azimuth, or definite direction in space ;
those which exist in common light being distributed impartially through all
azimuths. In order to simplify the problem of the influence of reflection upon
molecular movement Mr. Fresnel commenced this investigation by consider-
ing first the case of a wave polarized already in the plane of incidence. In
such a wave the molecular movements are (for reasons which will appear here-
after) presumed to take place in a plane whch is at right angles to the plane of
polurization. At the reflecting surface, they are therefore coincident with the
surface itself. If the ray is passing from a medium of less refracting power
into one of greater, we must suppose that the ether possesses either a different
elasticity, ora different density, or both, in the two media. Mr. Fresnel assumed
a difference of density without a difference of elasticity. He assumed, secondly,
that in the common surface or stratum bounding the media, the movements
parallel to the surface are common to both media, so that the components of
velocity in the incident and refleeted wave, parallel to the surface of reflection,
are together equal to the component of velocity in the transmitted wave parallel
to the same surface. Or, if unity represent the incident molecular velocity, o

We may regard the incident undulation as a mass
whose bulk is the prism abcd, and de: isity d, impinging upon a mass w hose bulk
is efgh, and density 0’. Since the molecular movements in this case are im the
the common surface of the media, the dreadths of the prisms, according to the
second assumption foregoing, are equal to each other. Their lengths will be A

:m!::bcXAx0: efx2'x 6! Now, the wave lengths are proportional to the
Cale of progress of the wave in the two meni a, (which we may denote by
Vand V’.) Hence, if we put + for the angle of incidence, and p for the angle
of refraction, we shall have, 4:4’::V: V’::sine:sinp. Also, ech=:, and

The value of the radical diminishes with the increase of the incidence; but
it diminishes less rapidly than cos:. For, the form of a binomial square being—

and as cose diminishes, the other part of the root of the radical increases, so
that the value of the entire radical diminishes less rapidly than cose. The
numerator ef the expression accordingly increases with increase of incidence,
and the denominator diminishes: and both these changes increase the value of
». Hence, the amount of light reflected increases from incidence —0° to inci-
dence —90°. It is worth observing that the expressions we have obtained
above for the molecular velocities of the reflected and refracted wave, are also
deducible directly from the ordinary formule for the impact of elastic bodies.

POLARIZATION BY REFLECTION. 191

Let us next examine the case of a wave polarized in a plane at right angles
to the plane of incidence. In this case, the molecular movements are in the
plane of incidence. ‘The expressions for the masses will be the same as before ;
but the components of the molecular velocities parallel to the reflecting surface
are to'be taken, instead cf the velocities themselves. These components are,
for the incident wave, 1 Xcosc; for the reflected wave, v’ Xcose; and for the trans-
mitted wave, w/Xcose : and the assumption of Fresnel is—

(1+ ')cose= w/cosp.*

* Tn the attempt to apply the theory of undulation to the case of reflection and refraction
at the surfaces or crystalline media, it has been found more satisfactory by Profs, McCullagh
and Neuman to employ the following assumptions, viz:

I. The vibrations of polarized light are parallel to the plane of polarization.

Il. The density of the ether in both media is the same as in vacuo.

III. The vis viva-is preserved.

IV. The resultant of the vibrations is the same in both media; and therefore, in singly
refracting media, the vibration of the refracted ray is the resultant of the vibrations of the
incident and reflected rays.

On these principles, the case of reflection in the plane of polarization is simp'e. Let the
refracted ray be extended backward, and it will divide the angle between the incident and
reflected rays (which equals 2c) into two parts, which are, respectiveiy, +p and c—p. Upon
this retroduced line as a diagonal, if a parallelogram be constructed with the incident and
reflected rays as sides, this diagonal and these sides will be proportional to the amplitudes,
and therefore to the velocities, of the mo'ecular movements which are perpendicular to them
severally. Employing then, as before, unity and the symbols v and wu to designate these
velocities, we shall have directly—

sin(c—p) sin2e
== — —, w=.
sin(t+p) sin(t-+p)

Tn the case of reflection in a plane at right angles to the plane of polarization the vibra-
tions are al] parallel, and the fourth principle above gives—

1+-0/=w’.

Also the third principle gives (m and m' representing the masses of the ether put into mo-
tion in the contiguous strata of the two media)—

m(1—v’?)—m'u®,

These equations lead to the values—
m—m' 2m

v=- . u=—— >:

The same values may also be deduced from the laws of impact of elastic bodies

According to the second principle, the masses m and m‘ are proportional to their volumes ;
and these volumes have been found in the text to be proportional to sinzcose and sinp cosp.
Substituting these expressions in place of m and m/’ in the foregoing fractions, we shall
obtain—

‘ Comparing these values with those of ihe text, we find those or v alike, but with reversed
signs and interchanged—that which represented the velocity of molecular movement nor-
mal to the plane of polarization before, now denoting the velocity of movement in the
plane, and v.v. In the expressions for the transmitted rays there is a difference which
results from the adoption of the second of the principles foregoing, making the densit of
the ether in the two media the same, which is not the supposition of the text. if

However strongly on some accounts this view of the subject may seem to recommend
itself to our accepiance, it introduces a difiiculty (elsewhere noticed) into the theory of double
refraction, which has never yet been met, and which scems to have been singularly ignored
by many who have engaged in this discussion. : shee

of elastic bodies, because, the density of the ether being by hy pothesis the same in both
media, the masses iepcting ¢ on each other will be as sine to sinp, or as to Ai

As the incidence inercases, the variations of the value of v and v’ will be dissimilar.
When vib.a.ion is in the piane of refiection and n exceeds unity, the positive term ncosp
is necessarily a'ways meater than the negative term cose. Both these terms diminish as ¢
increases. I! they dinumished at the same rate, the value of v would be constant. But
as 4 is always g@icater than p and neither excee sds 90°, the rate of diminution of cose is more
rapid than iha: of cos :p, and the value of v increases with the incidence. The same is true
when 7 is less than unity; only in that case the increasing value of v is negative. When
the incidence is maxinmuni, or -=9L°, x being greater than 1, cose=0 and v=1; that is te
say, the reflecied is equal to the incident light.

For the ainownt transmilicd in the same case, we have, at a perpendicular incidence—

. Qn
n--1°
And for .=90°, or the maximum incidence, » being greater than 1,
u=0.
It is also apparent that the amount transmitted constantly diminishes as ¢ increases.

When vibration is normal to the plane of reflection, the positive term in the value of v’,
which is neoss, is at fils gieater (2 being greater than unity) or less (” being less than unity)
than the negauve term cosp. But since at the maximum incidence cosi=0, there must be
some value of ¢ which wvl give ncosi=cosp, or ncost—cosp=0. Accordingly, at this inci-
dence no light wi:l be reflected.

The two conditious—

neosi==cosp, and nsinp=sinz,
give immediately—
sinp=cosl, or 1-+p=90°.

The incidence ¢ is the polarizing incidence; and we here sce that it fulfils the law of
Brewster.

At the maximum incidence, n being hates than 1, o'=—1. The sign of the molecular
movement, therefore, changes at the polarizing angle.

The agreement of these formulas with those obtained in the other case, is
what ought to be expected, since, at a perpendicular incidence, the direction of
molecular movement can have no influence on reflection; and at 90° impact ceases.
But if we examine the first value of ov! given above, we shall perceive that it
does not constantly increase with the increase of the incidence ; for the denom-
inator, tan (t+), becomes infinite when ¢+-+p=90°; and at this incidence »/~0,
or there is no reflection. If then, in the originally incident beam, there had
been a succession of waves, some of them polarized in the plane of’ incidence,
and the rest polarized at right angles to that plane, all this latter class of waves
would, at this particular incidence, be transmitted, while a portion of the others
would be reflected. The incident light, from the mixture of the two classes of
waves, would be imperfectly polarized, or not polarized at all: but the reflected
light would be wholly polarized in the plane of reflection.

In the result just reached, we see a reproduction of the law experimentally
established by Brewster, viz., that, at the polarizing angle, the transmitted ray
is at right angles to the incident ray, or -+p—=90°.

If we now take the case of a wave whose plane of polarization is in any azi-
muth to the plane of reflection between 0° and 90°, we may apply the principles
already illustrated, by decomposing its molecular movements into components,
one of which shall coincide with the plane of reflection, and the other with the
reflecting surface. If the given azimuth be a, the azimuth of the molecular
movements will be 90°—a. ‘Phe molecular movement in the plane of reflection
will therefore be cos(90°—a)—sina ; and that in the reflecting surface will be

That is to say, at this incidence the entire molecular movement normal to the plane of reflec-
tion is transmitted.

In this case the condition 14-v'=w' is always fulfilled. When vibration is in the plane of
reflection it is fulfilled only for the perpendicular incidence. At other incidences the fourth
principle of McCullagh and Neuman, quoted above, necessarily involves the truth of Fresnel’s
assumption for this case, viz:

(1+-v')cosi=w'cosp.

When x is less than 1, these formule fail for incidences beyond the limiting angle of total
reflection. : ;

This might easily be anticipated by considering that, in the supposed oa
the incident beam is equivalent to two beams, each having an intensity of 4,
and polarized—one in the plane of reflection, and the other in the plane perpen-
dicular to it. he reflected beam should contain one-half the force in each
plane which it would have done had each intensity been = 1.

Let there now be two beams each ==4, incident together, and polarized in the
azimuths a and a’. From what has just been said, it is evident that the value

R becomes, therefore, equal to the sum of the intensities of two rays each —$,

azimuths, follow each other in so close succession as to blend their impressions

equal, then the resultant effect of the whole must necessarily be—

But this is the condition of common light. The formula just stated, there-

the second term disappears. The reflected 'beam is then entirely polarized.

than the numerator. It follows that in the reflection of common light, a larger

or, in other words, that the reflected beam will be more or less polarized in the
plane of reflection.

In order to estimate the amount of this polarization, we must take the differ-
ence between the two terms in the value of R. And if we desire to find the
proportion of light polarized, we must divide this difference by the sum. Or

Reverting once more to the case of a wave polarized in azimuth a to the

§ VIIL—CIRCULAR AND ELLIPTICAL POLARIZATION BY REFLECTION.

In all that precedes it has been tacitly assumed that the initial phase of the
reflected undulation is a continuation of the final phase of the incident, or of
the same reversed ; and also that the virtual origins of the elementary waves of
which we suppose the resultant refle;.ed wave to be composed, are in one tnva-
riable surface, whatever be the azimuth of the incident molecular movements.
If these assumptions are entirely true, the expressions for the molecular velo-
city of the reflected wave ought to correspond with observation in all cases.
‘These expressions, nevertheless, fail for the case of total reflection at the second
surfaces of denser media, as will be apparent if we substitute the value of x,
which, in the cas¢ supposed, is less than unity in the formule.

——{ |
V n?—sin®:-+ cose
When sin: x”, v? and v”? each == 1; or the reflection is total. We know,

experimentally, that it continues to be total for all higher values of ¢; but the
radicals in the foregoing become imaginary. Mr. Iresnel, therefore, concluded
that reflection in some manner modities the phase of the undulation. Experi-
ment proves that it does so, and also that the degree of the modification depends
upon the azimuth of the molecular movements, and upon the incidence,

The conversion of plane into circular polarization by reflection in “ Hresnel’s
rhombs ” has been deseribed. ‘Che manner in which this change takes place
may now be understood. If the plane ray is incident in either of the principal
azimuths 0° or 90°, its plane of polarization is not affected by reflection. But
if its azimuth be 45°, it emerges from the rhomb after having undergone two
total reflections circularly polarized. Now the plane polarized ray in azimuth
45°, is equivalent to two plane polarized rays of half the intensity in azimuths
0° and 90.2 And as these components would singly undergo no sensible
change of plane by reflection, while jointly they produce a circularly polarized
ray, we infer that one of them has been advanced or retarded upon the other
by a quarter of an undulation. If the ray had undergone only one reflection
in the rhomb, or if it had undergone three, it would have emerged neither plane
polarized nor circularly polarized. If it had undergone four, it would have
emerged plane polarized again, with a change of 90° from its original azimuth.
Now, all these phenomena are represented by the equation [1] for the resultant
of vibrations at right angles to each other, which is as follows :

multiple of 4. It is therefore evident that, at each reflection in the rhomb, one
of the component waves is accelerated or retarded one-eighth of an undulation
upon the other.

The restoration of the plane polarization, after four reflections, in an azimuth
902 removed from the azimuth of incidence, may be understood by considering
the following illustration. Let the
arrow PP’ represent the amplitude
of movement in a polarized wave at
a given moment. Let this be re-
solved into two rectangular compo-
nents 45° inclined to it on each side,
represented by the arrows QQ! and
RR’. Suppose the molecule, at a
given instant, to be situated at the
point C* of its path. CP’ is the direction in which it is moving, and the length
of the line is the extent of its range. By two reflections in Fresnel’s rhomb,
or by any other cause, let the component IR’ be so advanced upon QQ! that,
at some future instant, the molecule shall have reached the limit of its range in
the horizontal direction, and shall be about to return (as at R in the second
system of arrows) when, in the vertical direction it is in the middle point, and
going toward Q'as before. This would be in CO’, but for the horizontal displace-
ment. In point of fact, it is at It. The vertical velocity, (represented by the
dotted arrow Q’Q',) is at its maximum, and the horizontal velocity is zero.
‘The conditions are such as, in the section on vibration, are shown to produce :
revolution of the molecule in a cirele. The path of the molecule will accord-
ingly be RQ’'R’Q. After two additional reflections in the rhomb, the horizontal
movement will be advanced over the vertical by another quarter of its double
vibration, and will bring the molecule, in its progress from right to left, to the
middle point, C", in the third system of arrows, at the same instant at which
the vertical movement, in the direction Q’, brings it to the same point. The
velocities are now both at their maximum, and are equal. The molecule takes
the mean direction, PP”, between them, and the ray is plane polarized in an
azimuth 90° from the original plane.

Suppose the eye of the observer to be at E, the revolution of the molecule is
dextrogyre, or, as it is also called, dextrorsum. Conceived as viewed in the oppo-
site direction, it would be levogyre, or sinistrorsum. In the earlier history of
this subject, some confusion arose from the fact that different observers applied
these terms in different ways. Since observation, however, is only made upon
rays approaching the observer, this is the point of view now universally adopted
in naming the direction of gyration. It appears, then, that the advance of the
left-hand component, by a quarter undulation, produces a dextrogyration, and
vice versa. If the plane of original polarization were P’P’”, then, iv the resola-
tion, RR! would be reversed, and the advance of RR’ would be the advance of
the right-hand component, producing levogyration. In this case, after four
reflections in F'resnel’s rhomb, the resultant plane of polarization would be PP’.

If we distinguish, as positive, the azimuths to the right of the plane of reflee-
tion, and, as negative, those to the left, we may say that a plane polarized ray
in original azimuth —45°, is circularly polarized dextrorsum by passing through
one of Fresnel’s rhombs; and becomes plane polarized again in azimuth + 45°,
after passing through two. If the original azimuth be +45, the circular polar-
ization is sinistrorsum, and the final azimuth of plane polarization, negative.
One of these rhombs may, therefore, be used as a polariscope, to detect the
direction of rotation of a circularly polarized ray.

If two rays, one in azimuth +459, and the other in azimuth —45°, were to
be reflected simultaneously in one of Iresnel’s rhombs, the two consequent

198 UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT.

gyrations, being in opposite directions, would produce a rectilinear resultant. In

; this case, suppose the molecule, M, to be in any part of the
circumference in which either of the gyrations would cause
it to revolve; it will be subject to the action of three forces:
one, MC, directed toward the centre of its orbit, and the
other two, represented by P and Q, equal and opposite. The
two latter neutralize each other, and the molecule pursues the
path MC. When the molecule is at M’, the tangential forces
P and Q, which will then have the directions P’ and Q’. will
not directly balance each other, but will have a resultant in
the direction RC. And for all other points in the path of
the molecule, as M”, M’”, &c., the resultant of the tan-
R eential forces will always be in the diameter, MN, of the

Fig. 49 orbit.

In Fig. 48 we have supposed the arrows PP'and P’'P’” to represent not only
the positions of the planes of molecular vibration, but the direction of the move-
ments. heir resultant plane is accordingly QQ’. If the dircction of one of
them, as of P’P”’, had been opposite, the resultant would be RR’. If the two
were in any equal positive and negative azimuths, greater or less than 45°, their
resultant gyrations would be elliptic; but the ellipses, being equal and similar,
and similarly situated to the plane.of reflection, while they are opposite in move-
ment, would still produce the vibration QQ. And two movements in azimuths
equally above and below 909, cither positive or negative, would in like manner
produce the plane vibration RR. Now the condition ef natural light is such
that, for every azimuth of its successive plane vibrations, as PP, producing, by
total reflection, a gyratory molecular movement, whether cireular or elliptic,
there will always be found another which will produce an equal and opposite
gyration. And, although these gyrations are suecessive and not simultancous,
though, therefore, there is never, in this case, any real composition, like that
illustrated in Fig. 49, neutralizing, im fact, the gyratory movements, yet the
compensatory effects follow each other with such rapidity that, to our instru
ments and our powers of vision, they are as if they did not exist. Common
light cannot, therefore, be polarized by total reflection. Moreover, common
light need not, in any case, be supposed to be made up strictly of plane. vibra-
tions. It is only necessary to suppose its gyratory movements to be as impar-
tially distributed as we have heretofore presumed its plane vibrations to be.

If, however, we suppose a surface which is not a surface of total reflection to
possess the power of accelerating or retarding one of the rectangular components
of the incident molecular velocity over the other, then the reflected light will,
in general, be elliptically polarized. For the two components are never equally

efleeted except in total reflection. Now there are very few substances capable

of reflecting light which do not possess this power, and, accordingly, ellipticak
polarization is the effect most usually attending reflection. As has been else-
where stated, it is only those substances whose indexes of refraction are very
near to 1.414 that produce a kind of polarization that is sensibly plane.

This subject has been very thoroughly investigated, theoretically, by Mr.
Cauchy, and experimentally by Mr. Jamin, with results mutually corroborative
of each other. In order to clearly understand the experimental methods
employed, let us observe that, if a plane polarized wave be supposed to be
decomposed into two rectangular component undulations, the curves represent-
ing these components will cross the common intersection of their planes in the
same points. These crossing points may be called nodes. In the case sup-
posed, the nodes of the two components are coincident. ‘The effect of reflection
is, in general, (2. e., in all cases except those which have the index of refraction
just now mentioned,) to throw the nodes of the components out of coincidence.
And the original plane polarization will be restored by bringing back the nodes

CIRCULAR POLARIZATION. 199

to their original coincidence, or by encreasing the discrepancy between them by
repeated reflections until it amounts to half an undulation. In the first case, if
the reflection were total, as at the second surface of glass. the plane of’ polari-
zation, after restoration, would be unaltered. In the second case, on similar sup-
positions, it would be changed 96°. When the reflection is not total, the
resultant plane, after the reunion of the displaced nodes, will differ from the
original plane in consequence of the unequal losses experienced by the two com-
ponents in reflection.

Both those methods have been employed in experimentally determining the
dislocating effects of different media, at diiferent incidences, upon the rectangular
components of plane polarized light. Many of Mr. eal $ more recent and
élaboratex -esearches have been made by the method first mentioned. The esseatial
part of his apparatus consisted in a double prism, formed of two equal acute
wedges of rock crystal, cut parallel to the axis, and combined as shown in the
figure annexed. The wedge ABC has the edge AB par-

iP, LB
Pi FB Ei allel to the axis, and’ the wedge ADC has the edge DC
A} $$ 2B perpendicular to the axis. The surfaces AB and DC are

both parallel to the axis. If a plane polarized ray, PQ,

Di | .4, @ pass at right angles to AB through the middle of this

a plane polarized, and the position of its plane will remain
Fiz. 50. unaltered whatever be the azimuth of incidence; the dis-
locating effect of the double refraction of one of the wedges being compensated
by an equal and opposite effect of the other. But if the system be moved
the right or to the left, the two opposite effects will no longer be equal. This
being a positive e crystal, the component of molecular movement parallel to AB
will be in retardation of that perpendicular to AB, for the position of the ray,
P’Q’. and will be in advance tor the position P'Q’. But if the ray has been
alr ready dislocated by reflection, some part of the prism may be found which
will produce an equal and contrary effect, so as to restore the plane polarization
All that is necessary, then, to make this instrument a measure of the dislocation
is to connect it with a scale and a screw movement, and to determine the value of
the seale divisions. This last determination is easy. since a run which converts
a plane polarized ray into a ray plane polarized with a difference of azimuth of
90°, is equivalent to half an undulation. Mr, Jamin’s apparatus accomplished
this change in twelve complete turns of the screw. Smaller divisions were
measured by the graduation.of the serew-head, of which there were two hun-
dred divisions to the revolution. The deli icacy of the contrivance may be appre-
ciated from this statement. It is known as Mr. Jamin’s “compensator.”

It would occupy too much space to attempt here to give a full account of Mr.
Jamin’s interesting researches, or of the methods employ ed by him auxiliary to
that just described. The most important results of his investigations are the
following :

Nearly all transparent bodies produce, by reflection from their surfaces, a
difference of phase between the component waves polarized in the two principal
planes. All whose indexes of refraction exceed 1.414, advance the phase of the
component polarized in the plane of incidence. All those whose indexes are
below that value retard the phase of the same component.

The difference of phase augments with the incidence from 42 at 0° to 2 at
90°, and becomes #4 at the polarizing angle. The variations are slow and
almost insensible for some distance from either 0° or 90°. ‘They usually become
sensible near the polarizing angle. ‘The limits are nearer together as the polari-
zation under that angle is wreater.

Beyond these limits the polarization is plane, but imperfect. Within them it
is elliptic.

The two limits are nearer to each other as the index of refraction approaches
200 UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGH&T.

1.414. They wnite, for substances whose index has that exact value. Mr.
Jamin found but two substances in which this condition is falfilled. They were
a specimen of menilite, and a crystal of alum cut perpendicularly to the axis of
the octahedron. Water and glass, which under ordinary light appear to polarize
perfectly, are easily seen not to do so under the strong light of the sun.

In the cases in which the index has the particular value just mentioned, the
advance of phase at the polarizing angle is “brusque” from 4 to 2. This is
very nearly the case with water and glass.

teflection from the surface of metals always produces elliptical polarization.
‘The advance of phase is progressive from incidence 0° to incidence 90°. 'There
are, however, very large differences between metals in this respect.

§ IX. ROTATORY POLARIZATION.

We are now perhaps prepared to understand the reason of the rotation of the
plane of polarization of a ray transmitted along the axis of a crystal of quartz.
We have seen that Fresnel, by an ingenious combination of prisms, succeeded in
demonstrating the existence within the crystal of two cireularly polarized rays,
gyrating in opposite directions. And we have seen that the resultant effect of
two opposite gyrations is to produce a movement in a plane. ‘Phe gyratory
movements within the crystal are then not actwal but virtwal—in other words
there are forces constantly tending to produce these gyrations, which hold each
other in equilibrio or at least nearly so. We must consider these forces as suc-
cessively traversing all azimuths within the length of each undulation. If the
wave were of the same length for both gyrations, the forces being presumed
equal, the molecular movement would be constantly rectilinear, and the plane
of polarization would not change. But, as the plane does in fact change, we are
led to infer that the undulation lengths for the two rays are xo¢ equal. The
annexed figure may serve to illustrate the mutual action of
these rays. Suppose MADB to be the orbit in which a
force P tends to urge a molecule, M, to revolve around the
centre, C, to which it is drawn by the foree MC. Suppose
the equal force Q to urge the same molecule to describe the
same orbit in the opposite direction. 'These forces holding
each other in equilibrio, the molecule will follow the direc-
tion of the third force, MC.

Now suppose the force Q suspended, the molecule will
take the direction of the circle ADB, and will continue te
revolve in it so long as the force P (supposed always tan-
gential) continues to act. But its movement will impart to
the molecule next below it a similar motion, and that to the
next, and so on; so that, as these successive molecules take
up their movement later and later, there will be a series in
different degrees of advancement in their several circles,
forming a spiral; and when the molecule M shall have
returned to its original position, the series will oceupy a position like the curve
MEFLN'OR. If now P be supposed to be in turn suspended, while the force @
continues to act, the effect of @ will be to produce a contrary spiral, which may
be represented by MSK'TV. If MD be a diameter of the cirele MADB, drawn
from M, and DNHN’ be a line parallel to the axis CG of the cylindrical surface
which is the locus of the spirals, then, if the undulation lengths are the same
for both movements, the two spirals will intersect DH in the same point, the
intersections marking the completion of a half uadulation for each. But if these
lengths be unequal, the intersections with DH will take place at different points,
as N and N’.

Let now a plane intersect the cylinder at any distance below MADB, as at

INDEX OF ROTATORY POLARIZATION. 901

FE, parallel to MADB. It is conceivable that this plane may be made to pass
through the point where the spirals intersect each other. If I mark the point
of intersection, and we draw the tangents IP’ and IQ’ in the plane of the circle
HI, then there will be a molecule at the point I which will be in the cireum-
stances of the molecule in Fig. 49 at the point M—that is to say, solicited by
three forces, of which two, IP’ and IQ’, are equal and opposite, and the third is
directed in the line IG toward the centre. The molecule will, therefore, move
in this line, and not in a circle; and if the plane of the cirele EHIH’ be the
bounding surface of the crystal, or the surface of emergence of the light, IG will
mark the azimuth of the molecular movement of the emergent ray.

But if the plane of KHIH’ do not pass through the point of intersection of
the spirals, it must cut each spiral in a different point. ‘The figure is drawn to
represent this more general case, the points of intersection with the spirals being
severally Land K. By joining LK, and drawing the radius GI perpendicular
to it, G1 will bisect the angle LGK, and M’, at the intersection of GI and LK,
will be the position of the molecule in the plane EHLIK, which, if the tangen-
tial force P only were acting, would be at L, and if the tangential force Q only
were acting, would be at K. The tangential forces acting ‘at the moment on
this molecule will not be represented by IP! and IQ’, but by tangents at K and
L, like RP’ and RQ’ in Fig. 49, in which figure the position of the molecule M!
corresponds to that marked by the same letter in the present figure ; but in that
figure the resultant of the tangential forces is RC, directed to the centre, and in
this it will, in like manner, be IG.

Now, as DH, the distance between the planes ADB and EHI, is a larger
art of the length of an entire turn of the spiral MSNK than of the spiral
{I LN’, the line GI will fall on the right of GH, the position it would

oceupy if the two undulations were equal in length. We may therefore say, as
before, that if the plane EHI were the surface of emergence of a ray froma
crystal, in which it had been subject to the action of the forces supposed, its
plane of polarization, GI, would be turned toward the right from its original
azimuth. ‘The plane of polarization turns, therefore, in the direction of the
winding of the closest spiral, or of the ray of shortest undulation; but it turns
in the direction of the gyration of the ray of longest undulation.

This rotation of the plane thus demonstrates that the two rays advance with
unequal velocities in the axis of quartz—a remarkable fact which is not true of
any crystal which produces plane polarization only.

It also enables us to determine the relative velocities, or to ascertain the index
of rotatory polarization. For since GI bisects the angle between the points K
and L, which mark the relative degrees of advancement of the two rays in their
respective rotations, if we take a thickness, 0, which produces a rotation of 90°,
we know that the difference of phase is then one-half an undulation. If 2 de-
note the length of the longer undulation, and /’ that of the shorter, then—

known for rotatory polarization.

When light is transmitted through quartz at right angles to the axis, the
emergent rays are plane polarized. My. Airy has proved that, for directions
oblique to the axis, the polarization is elliptic, the ellipticity increasing from
the direction perpendicular up to the direction parallel to the axis, where it
becomes circular.
202 UNDULATORY THEORY OF LIGHT.

It is dificult to conceive exactly the physical action by which rotatory polari-
zation is produced. But there is no difficulty in imagining such a decomposition
of the molecular movements in a plane polarized ray, as shall represent the
relations which exist after the rotatory polarization has been established. We
have seen that when a plane undulation has been resolved into two equal rectan-
gular components, if the nodal joints of these components become dislocated by
a quarter of an undulation, the resultant will be a movement in a circular orbit.
We have also seen that when the left-hand component is advanced by this
amount, the motion becomes dextrogyre; and whea the right-hand component
is advanced, it becomes levogyre. In order, then, to explain the co-existence
of two opposite circular polarizations, we must suppose two sets of equal
rectangular components dislocated in these two opposite ways. This was the
hypothesis of Fresnel.

In order to facilitate the conception, suppose the arrow P to represent, in
quantity and direction, the molecular movement, at a given instant, in the origi-

nal plane polarized wave. Imagine it to be
AR aresultant of two other waves, Q and R,
one in front of it, and the other behind it,
reach at the distance of one-eighth of an un-
dulation. ‘these will then be a quarter of
an undulation distant from each other. Let
Q and R be again resolved, each into two
equal rectangular components, in azimuths
Fig. 52. + 45° and —45°; Q, into g and7; and R
into g’ and 7’. Consider all these four component movements, at the instant
supposed, and in the positions represented, to be at their maximum of velocity,
in the direction of the several arrows denoting them. Then, if we consider the
relative stages of advancement, or phases of: movement, of the pair g and 7, in
respect to g/ and 7’, when both are referred to a common plane, it will be seen
that the latter, though most advanced in position, are least advanced in phase
For, if we conceive the curves of these waves to be drawn, the ascending node
of g/ will be found in the plane of gr, and the descending node of q in the plane
of q'r’. Hence, at the point where the wave g! begins, the wave g is one-quarter
advanced.

We have, then, two pairs of plane undulations, g and 7’ and 7 and q’, severally
normal to each other, and with nodes dislocated to the extent of one-quarter of
an undulation; g and 7 being the members of the pairs which are most advanced
in phase. In the case of the pair g and 7’, the right-hand component being that
which is most advanced, the resultant movement is a revolution sinistrorsum.
In the case of 7 and q' the resultant will be a revolution dextrorsum.

The values of these several components are determined from the general
equation following, which is simply equation [3,] with the symbols changed:

P*=—Q-_ RR? 20 eos’:

By hypothesis R=Q, and 0—90°. Hence P?==2Q?, and Q=55

It appears, therefore, that the molecular velocity in each of the component
waves q,7, q',7', is equal to one-half that of P, as it should be, in order that the
sum of their living forces may be equal to the living force of the primitive wave.

Since the two circularly polarized rays in the axis of quartz have unequal
INTERFERENCES OF CIRCULARLY POLARIZED RAYS. 203

velocities, there must be certain thicknesses of the crystal, which will make the
difference of their paths equal to half an undulation, or to an odd multiple of
half an undulation. It might be supposed, therefore, that in such cases inter-
ference would occur, so that the crystal should naturally exhibit colors. The
fact is not so; and if we consider the conditions we shall discover without diff-
culty the reasons why it is not. If, in Fig. 52, the two components g a and 7‘ of
one of the circularly polarized rays be supposed to advance or ga 1in upon g’ and
r, the distance between g and q‘ will diminish until ¢ passes q’, ‘and the distance
between 7 and 7’ will constantly increase. If e¢ represent the amount of advance,
the distance of 7’ from the plane of gr in the figure will be c+4/, and the dis-
tance of g from the same plane will be c only. Now, since g and q’ are equal,
the resultant to which they are equivalent will fall half way between them,
(page 167.) The same is true in regard to the resultant of 7 and 7’. But the
point half way between g and q! will be situated at a distance frora the plane
gr which is the mean of the distances of g and q’; thus—

Distance of Tae aay jesse
Distance of q/= ws bc a a aad

In like manner—

Distance of r=0
Distance of 7? ==c+4iA ; Mean =7\ra)) 304 a
That is to say, the resultants of the components in ec ach plane always coincide
in position. We have next to consider their values. From the statements
above it appears that the distance between r and 7’ is the entire distance of 7”
from the plane gr—that is, =c++44. And the distance between g and q' is the
difference of the distances of g and q! severally from the same plane gr—that is,
c—yi.
Tn the general equation for the resultant of two waves whose molecular move-

ments are in the same plane, (equation [3,]) we must accordingly introduce the
following values of 0:

For g and q/, 9=25(5—2).

For 7 and 7, 6=2z (+4).

Then putting Pp for the first resultant, and p’ for the second, and remembering
that g— g’—=r=r’, the equations become,

PHP+q?+2¢qq' cos: a(S — iS =P+q?4+2¢q' sindn5 = 2¢° (1+sinzc€),

_ Whence pt pr=297+2r=con-tant. And the intensity of the light is inva-
ree considering the foregoing values of p? and p”, however, it will be seen

that they are severally variable, though their variations are always compen-
satory. Ifé be any number of half undulations—

decrements of the other, and each becoming periodically zero. It accordingly
follows that if two circularly polarized rays, whose molecular gyrations are
performed in opposite directions, be thrown together in a nearly common direc-
tion, and observed by means of an analyzer, fringes of interference may be de-
tected in the two principal azimuths, those in one of these azimuths being com-
plementary to those in the other.

Mr. Babinet made this observation, employing Arago’s prism to produce in-
terfering pencils of plane polarized light ; which pencils he polarized circularly
by means of “ quarter-wave lamin ”’ of mica placed in their paths. ‘The gyra-
tions were made of opposite kinds in the two pencils, by placing the two laminz
so that their principal planes should be at right angles to each other. As an
analyzer, he employed a doubly refracting prism. ‘The fringes immediately
appeared; thus furnishing a very interesting experimental corroboration of a
theoretic anticipation.

In the year 1845 Mr. Faraday communicated to the Royal Society of London
a very remarkable discovery which he had made, of the apparent influence of
magnetism upon light. If any homogeneous transparent body be placed under
the influence of a powerful electro-magnet, it will possess the property, while
the magnetism is maintained, of turning the plane of a ray of polarized light
traversing it in the direction of a line joining the magnetic poles, in the same
manner as such a ray is turned by quartz, or by liquids possessing the property
of rotatory polarization. Mr. Faraday was at first disposed to attribute this effect
to a direct action of magnetism on light, but that idea is now abandoned; and
the received opinion on the subject supposes that the molecules of the medium
undergo some modification during the continuance of the magnetic influence,
which assimilates their action upon the ether to that of substances which pos-
sess permanently the power of rotatory polarization. ‘The direction in which the
plane of polarization was turned in these experiments depended on the direction
of the electric currents. When the currents were reversed, the rotation was
reversed also. It is impossible in this place to do more than to allude to this
interesting discovery.

§ X. CHROMATICS OF POLARIZED LIGHT.

We will now proceed to apply the principles we have been considering to the
explanation of the colors produced in doubly refracting substances by polarized
light. We have seen that double refraction consists in the generation of two
waves of unequal velocity and of dissimilar form in the doubly refracting body.
We have also seen that the molecular movements in the two waves are at right
angles to each other. In consequence of the inequality of velocity the two rays
into which a doubly refracting body divides a single incident ray may emerge
from a surface opposite and parallel to the surface of incidence in different
phases. If not entirely separated by the deviation of their paths, they may
thus, so far as phase vs concerned, be in condition to interfere. But we have
seen that interference is impossible between waves whose molecular movements
are perpendicular to each other. If, then, by any contrivance, we can turn the
planes of polarization of two rays which, by double refraction, have been made
to differ in their length of path by half an undulation, or by any odd number
of half undulations, so that these planes shall coincide, interference will be pro-
duced. It is this which is done in the arrangements which have been described,
by which the gorgeous colors first observed by Arago in plates of doubly re-
fracting crystals, are made to appear. In the first place, the lamina must be
doubly refracting, in order that there may be two rays. In the second place,
it must be thin, that the difference of length of path may be small. In the third
place, the original light must be polarized, otherwise there will be two systems
of interferences compensating each other, and obliterating each other’s effects.
CRYSTALLINE PLATES IN POLARIZED LIGHT. 205

In the fourth place, the principal plane of the lamina should, in order to produce
the most complete interference, be at an azimuth of 45° to the plane of original
polarization—the two rays being, in this position of the crystal, exactly equal
to each other. In the fifth place, we must observe the phenomena by means of
an analyzer, which allows only the light polarized in a single plane to come
to the eye, or which, like a doubly refracting prism, separates the emergent
light which is polarized in one plane from that which is polarized in the trans-
verse plane; otherwise in this case again we shall have the blended effeets of
two compensatory interferences. Tinally, the principal plane of the analyzer
should, in order to produce the best effect, be at an azimuth of 45° from the
principal plane of the lamina. The necessity of this condition may be readily
deduced from the law of Malus. ‘The annexed figure may illustrate the changes
which take place in the passage of the ray
