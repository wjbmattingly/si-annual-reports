Each year the Smithsonian Institution and certain of its branches—
notably the U. S. National Museum, the Bureau of American Eth-
nology, and the Astrophysical Observatory—send into the field expe-
ditions for the purpose of obtaining information and collections needed
in the pursuance of their researches in biology, geology, anthropology,
and astrophysics. The results of these researches are published sooner
or later, usually as technical papers, in one of the series issued by the
Institution. In the meantime it is considered desirable to present in
this annual explorations pamphlet brief articles on the field expeditions
themselves. The articles, written by the field workers, tell of the
purpose of the expeditions, the methods of acquiring the desired ma-
terial, something of the results obtained, and perhaps a little of the
interest of scientific work in the field, often in places seldom visited
by man. The whole gives an idea of the wide scope of the Institution’s
scientific activities, undertaken with the sole purpose of increasing
knowledge and diffusing it.

By GG. ABBOT,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, and Director of the
Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory

For many years we have operated stations on high mountains in
distant desert lands making daily observations of the intensity of the
sun’s rays, on which all life and weather depend. This tedious cam-
paign is just reaching its victory.

As shown in figure 1, short-interval changes of solar radiation,
taking four or five days in which to produce a rising or a falling
sequence of solar change averaging only 0.8 per cent, obviously cause
changes in the temperature and barometric pressure at Washington.’
Opposite causes in solar change plainly produce opposite effects in
weather. Some of the effects are simultaneous with their solar causes.
Others are delayed 10 or more days, probably drifting down in waves
from distant centers of direct solar action. These delayed effects, as
well as the direct ones, are often large, equalling or exceeding 5°
Fahrenheit in their average values.

The conclusion is surprising. Hitherto it has commonly been sup-
posed that weather is merely the fluctuation effected by local terres-
trial conditions in the orderly periodic march of climate. These new
results indicate, on the contrary, that weather is principally caused by
frequent interventions of variations of the sun, affecting terrestrial
affairs.

The delayed effects just pointed out give promise of long-range
forecasting values. It would be still more promising if regular perio-
dicities should be found in the solar variations. This is the case.
Figure 2 shows that from 1918 to 1930 the principal variations in the
solar radiation, as given by monthly mean values, are well represented
as the sum of five periodicities, and five only. They are of 68, 45, 25,
Ir, and 8 months, respectively, and are all closely related to the 114-year
sun-spot cycle and the 33-year Bruckner cycle. The search for shorter
periods is beginning, and, as curve H shows, reveals a period of 45 days
and another one-eighth thereof as having continued through the
year 1924.

The expected march of solar variation in the years 1931 and 1932
is shown in curve I.

Our three observatories in the field at Montezuma, Chile, Table
Mountain, California, and Mount Brukkaros, South West Africa, have
carried on as usual. The following extracts from the diary of
Mrs. Sordahl, wife of the director at Mount Brukkaros, show some of
the unusual incidents of life in a Hottentot reservation.

January 2, 1930. The blue cats of Mount Brukkaros celebrated the New Year
by raiding our chicken house at two o’clock this morning. Adam woke us up,
and Louis jumped out, grabbed his pistol and rifle and flash light and went
up to the chicken house. The wild cat was still inside. Louis shot it with his
.32 Luger. Adam skinned the cat and I prepared it as a flat skin. We had a
chicken dinner.

January 24, 1930. During last night’s storm, the lightning had struck the
tunnel. The cotton wrapping on the wires was burned, also the wires, box,
shunt, resistance box and Wheatstone bridge; both strips in the bolometer were
broken, lights burned out, second Wheatstone damaged, and theodolite blackened.

Alfred went to town, sent cablegram to Dr. Abbot. .... 4 January 25, 1930.
The men worked all day repairing instruments. ..... January 26, 1930. The

men worked all day at the tunnel. I stood by and tried to be of help, but per-
haps was more of a hindrance. They ran a plate test at 5:30 p. m. Had a ter-
“stopped up” so the men had to fix
that too, and the whirlwind took the sacks off the coleman lamps. Trouble
never comes singly.

May 18, 1930. Went back to Berseba and waited to see the wedding. The
Hottentots perform their own pagan ceremonies of marriage first, and the next
day they have the missionary marry them according to Christian rites. The
bride was hidden away from all the ceremony and celebration. This is done to
test her faithfulness as a lover. The groom walked about with a look of loneli-
ness and despair as he could not take part in the gayeties either. He wore a
bright orange pair of trousers, black pointed shoes, and a felt hat, all of which
made a peculiar combination of Hottentot and European styles. The groom’s
relatives form a procession and go to the bride’s parents’ home with the inheri-
tance. The bride’s relatives do likewise to the groom’s home. The groom’s

rific whirlwind today. The stove became

train consisted of seven yoke of oxen drawing a wagon load of food. The wagon
was covered with green foliage. Behind the wagon, the men drove teams of
goats. A long line of women walked on either side, carrying green branches
forming an arch over the oxen and goats to conceal the gifts that the bride was
to receive. The two parties met half way between the homes, crossed paths
and proceeded to the opposite home. After this ceremony the celebration
begins. They build a large fire to barbecue the meat and cook the mealy meal.
Mr. Mutz told us that in good years they kill as many as twenty head of oxen
for a wedding, but during poor years such as this one the number seldom exceeds
seven. They eat, drink, dance and sing all night. The next noon the missionary
marries them again.
PURSUING MICROFOSSIES

Brak sy BAS SIEHIR:
Head Curator of Geology, U. S. National Museum

During the last quarter of a century the Smithsonian Institution has
fostered the study of three groups of micro-organisms, the Bryozoa,
Ostracoda, and Foraminifera, originally as a contribution to pure
science, and later, when their value in determining oil and other zones
in the earth’s crust became evident, as a distinct aid to economic
progress. In this work the Institution has had the valuable assistance
of two collaborators, Dr. Joseph A. Cushman of Sharon, Massachu-
setts, the well-known authority on Foraminifera, and Dr. Ferdinand
Canu of Versailles, France, one of the foremost students of post-
Paleozoic and Recent Bryozoa. Since 1909, it has been my privilege to
be associated with Doctor Canu, not only in research on the Bryozoa,
but also in building up the Museum's study series of this class.

Our first extensive work, based on the Tertiary rocks of North
America, was prepared under the joint auspices of the Smithsonian
Institution and the United States Geological Survey. Its purpose was
to work out a classification for the group, and also to learn the strati-
eraphic occurrence of the numerous American species to further their
utilization in geologic work. Our later studies have included both the
Mesozoic and Recent faunas, while there was recently completed a
monographic study of the Philippine fauna in which many of the post-
Paleozoic genera are described and illustrated.

Our collaboration has been carried on almost entirely through corre-
spondence, and it was not until the past summer that Doctor Canu
found an opportunity to make his first visit to the United States.
Meeting in New York upon his arrival early in June, we immediately
started on a field trip through the New England States, during which
we combined the collecting of Recent bryozoans along the coast with
explorations for suitable exhibition material from the igneous rocks
of Massachusetts and Maine. We were fortunate during part of our
trip in being the guests of our friends Dr. and Mrs. J. A. Cushman.
They took us by automobile to the various areas we wished to study,
and most kindly entertained us at their home in Sharon, also the site of
the Cushman Foraminiferal Laboratory. This laboratory is of such
interest to scientific students that I am including an account of its work
and aims, furnished me by Doctor Cushman :

SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1930 9

The Laboratory was built in 1923 to serve as a private research laboratory
connected with problems on the Foraminifera. Later one room was opened for
graduate students of Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Tech-
nology who received instruction here. There is also room for visiting workers
on the Foraminifera. The building consists of laboratory rooms and rooms for
clerical work, library, etc., on the main floor, together with a steel and con-
crete addition somewhat separated from the main building but connected with
it, in which are housed the collections, special library, card catalogue, etc. The
basement is given up to rooms for preparation of material, photographic work,
and a room for carpentry work such as building cases, etc. There is gathered
together here a great deal of material from classic localities representing vari-
ous parts of the world, which has been acquired through exchange, collecting,
or purchase. There is a library of between 2,000 to 2,500 separates, including
practically all the important works on the Foraminifera. There is also a unique
card catalogue of figures and references to published records on the Foramin-
ifera. These, which number at the present time about 75,000 cards, have a copy
of the original figures pasted on the card with the references given, the original
place of publication, formation and locality, with often times the complete
description and notes. These are arranged by genera, by species under each
genus, and the references under each species chronologically. In addition there
is a separation of Recent, Tertiary, Cretaceous, Jurassic, and Paleozoic, indi-
cated by colored tab cards. This makes it possible to very quickly find the
original figure of any species, or the records for a given formation. There
are also collections containing many thousand slides of identified species, many
of which are from the original type localities, together with a very consider-
able number of actual holotypes and figured specimens. These collections are
being augmented rapidly, and are eventually to go to the U. S. National
Museum where it is hoped active work will be continued on the group for a
long time as is now being done here.

After several days at the Laboratory spent in reviewing past work
and planning for the future, and studying Doctor Cushman’s methods,
we motored north along the Atlantic Coast from Cape Cod to Portland,
Maine. On this trip my attention was given over to the location of
outcrops of igneous rocks from which large specimens showing geo-
logical phenomena could be quarried for exhibition at the Museum.
Doctor Canu’s interest, on the other hand, was concerned with the
collecting of Recent Bryozoa, which he found encrusting pebbles of
the igneous rocks or attached to the seaweed. Our present studies were
therefore far apart in time, his relating to the present while mine
dated back millions of years—almost to the beginning of earth history.
Figure 8 illustrates how a small area can serve such widely divergent
interests. Doctors Canu and Cushman are seen collecting Recent bryo-
zoans in the rocky cove (near Scituate, Mass.), while nearby can be
observed a dike of dark igneous rock cutting through the light colored
granite.

classic geologic areas of America, was next in order. Here Doctor
Cushman pointed out the complicated structure of the Paleozoic rocks,
particularly the Roxbury conglomerate and the associated beds of
tillite. The origin of these two formations was much in doubt until,
in 1910, a resemblance of the tillite to present day glacial bowlder clay
was recognized by Dr. R. W. Sayles. This tillite, now known to be of
Upper Paleozoic age, is especially well exposed at Squantum Head
(fig. 9), the peninsula jutting out into the southern part of Boston
Bay. The outcrops here are of such interest that the area has been
presented to the city as a public park. Consequently no exhibition
specimens could be collected, but Doctor Sayles, who is much interested
in having a display of the conglomerate and associated bowlder clays
in the National Museum, holds out a hope that permission may be
granted for obtaining such an exhibit in the near future.

Since two of the main building stones of our Natural History
building came from adjacent areas—the granite used in the construc-
tion of the basement from Milford, Massachusetts, and the white mica
granite used in the first and second stories from Bethel, Vermont, |
was naturally interested in spending some time in a study of their
characteristics and occurrence.

Continuing north, other regions along the coast were explored, the
last being the Leda clay district of Maine where the possibility of
securing a considerable section of this interesting laminated clay was
investigated.

On the return trip we took the route through the White Mountain
district and the peneplain area of lower New England, securing photo-
graphs illustrative of the physiographic development of these regions.

Leaving New England, where we had enjoyed such pleasant associa-
tions and gained important geological information, Doctor Canu and |
proceeded to Washington. After spending several weeks together at
the Museum in preliminary work on our next bryozoan monograph,
several short trips were made to Atlantic Coastal Plain areas to study
at first hand the geological relationships of faunas under consideration.
Our particular interest lay in the bryozoan fauna of the so-called
Vincentown, New Jersey, marl, whose close faunal relation to the
Upper Mesozoic of Europe is most striking. Until recently this marl
has been regarded as marking the top of the Mesozoic era, but Ameri-
can students who have investigated the other classes of fossils of this
fauna and associated strata, now question the Cretaceous age of the
deposit, believing it to be Middle Eocene, a much younger formation.
As the Vincentown marl is at the boundary between two great eras of

2
12 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

geologic time, the Mesozoic and Cenozoic, and apparently shows rela-~
tionship—at least in its bryozoan fauna—to certain strata in Europe,
it is desirable that a detailed study be made, not merely to present
descriptions of the species, but to bring out principles involved in
intercontinental correlation. Our collections of Bryozoa secured from
Vincentown, New Jersey (fig. 10), and other points along the Atlantic
Coastal Plain, assure us of abundant material from which to obtain
tangible results. The work had progressed so far by July, the time
of Doctor Canu’s return to France, that completion of the monograph

is practically assured.
POSSIE HUNTING IN THE BRIDGER BASIN
OF WYOMING

By CHARLES W. GILMORE,
Curator, Division of Vertebrate Paleontology, U. S. National Museum

In the southwestern part of Wyoming an extensive area of badland
country known as the Bridger Basin has long been a fertile collecting
field for those in quest of the remains of fossil vertebrates. This basin,
the formation, and the early military post called Fort Bridger were all
named in honor of Jim Bridger, that intrepid frontiersman, scout, and
Indian fighter who pioneered this region.

The first collection of fossils from the Bridger formation was made
in 1870 by a Yale party under the leadership of Prof. O. C. Marsh,
and it marked the beginning of a long series of expeditions which have
disclosed the varied and abundant animal life that existed here in
Eocene times. The need of an adequate representation of this impor-
tant fauna in the National Museum collections has been long felt,
and it was to supply this need that in the spring of 1930 plans were
consummated for an expedition into the Bridger area.

In the latter part of May, I left Washington for Green River, Wyo-
ming, the base of operations, where I was joined by Messrs. George F.
Sternberg and George B. Pearce, both of Hays, Kansas; the former as
field assistant and the latter as cook for the party. From Green River
we proceeded almost immediately to Fort Bridger in the southwestern
part of the Basin where supplies were obtained, and our first camp was
established on Smith’s Fork, near the small town of Mountain View.

Prior to entering the field my tentative plan of operations was to
begin in the southwestern part of the Basin and work eastward,
searching in succession the exposures which are to be found paralleling
the courses of the several creeks that flow northward into the Basin
from the foothills of the Uinta Mountains to the south. In the main
this plan was adhered to.

Failing to find much of interest along Smith’s Fork, we soon moved
camp to the head of Little Dry Creek where better success awaited us.
Several weeks were spent here in systematically searching the denuded
breaks and hills that form the escarpment along this creek and our work
was well rewarded. In the first few days here an incident occurred
that is so unusual as to seem worth relating. One day in crossing a
small water course the car became stalled in the soft mud of the creek

bottom. Looking about for stones with which to block up the wheels,
we noticed a rocky layer protruding from the bank and Pearce was
instructed to get the pick and pry out some of it for ballast. A stroke
or two with the pick brought an exclamation of surprise, for on the
under side of the first slab detached was the complete skull of a croco-
dile in excellent preservation. A most happy surprise and a valued
addition to our then small accumulation of fossils.

On June Ir, camp was moved to a site on Leavitt Creek and here
we were successful in finding some of the best collecting ground yet
encountered. Four weeks of collecting here brought us past the middle
of the season and inasmuch as all of our work had been in the lower
half of the formation, it was decided to move to a locality where the
upper measures offered good collecting ground. Accordingly on
July 16 our fourth and last camp was established on Henry’s Fork,
about a mile north of Lone Tree postoffice and here the remaining
weeks of the season were profitably spent.

As a result of this work a great mass of material was accumulated
which is thought to contain much of scientific interest and importance,
in addition to some few specimens of an outstanding character. The
collection filled 24 large cases having a combined weight of 7,430
pounds.

Among the specimens of outstanding interest are an almost complete
articulated skeleton of Hyrachyus, a rhinoceros-like animal about the
size of the modern tapir ; a skeleton slightly less complete of Orohip pus,
a small primitive horse; two partial skeletons of Palacosyops and two
crocodile skeletons that are more or less complete. At least four mount-
able skeletons for the exhibition series will result from the above
mentioned materials. In addition there are many parts of skeletons,
i. ¢., skulls, jaws, articulated limbs and feet of both large and small
mammals.

Irom a scientific point of view, the small mammal material such as
tooth-filled jaws and parts of skulls in some instances associated with
parts of skeletons, may prove to be the more important part of the
collection. In all there were nearly 200 such specimens coming from
all horizons, ranging from near the base to the top of the formation,
representing beds of not less than 1,000 feet in thickness.

In this connection it is of interest that in two instances we definitely
located the source of certain elements of this micro-fauna by finding
a considerable number of specimens actually in situ. The importance
of thus locating them may be better appreciated if I explain that
perhaps 50 were thus located, whereas 150 others were collected from

the weathered surfaces and their precise position in the geological
section could not be accurately determined.

Thirty-eight turtle specimens representing several genera and
species and varying in size from those with shells a few inches in
length to giant tortoises nearly a yard long are also included in the
collection. In two instances complete skulls and other bones of the
skeleton were found associated with the carapace and plastron. Turtle
skulls are extremely rare, and both of those obtained appear to be
perfect with the lower jaws in place. Perhaps in no other formation
of North America is there such an abundance of turtle specimens
as are found in the Bridger. They occur almost everywhere in the
formation both horizontally and vertically. In one locality we found
an outcropping layer 50 feet or more in length that was composed
almost exclusively of turtle shells. These were packed together so
closely that it was impossible to remove one specimen from the mass
without damaging a number of others. So far as could be determined
in the field all appeared to pertain to a single genus.

Although there can never be more than surmise as to the catas-
trophe that brought about this great destruction of chelonian life,
several possibilities might be mentioned. A shower of volcanic ashes,
any one of

noxious gases, or a sudden flow of superheated water
these would be capable of destroying these animals. That volcanoes
were active in Bridger times is abundantly proved by the well estab-
lished fact that many of the layers of this formation are composed
exclusively of volcanic ash.

The concentrated accumulation of so many turtles in this one spot
may possibly be explained as having been brought about by current
action. A flowing stream during a freshet may have assembled the
shells from a considerable area and floating down stream these were
caught in an eddy or were stranded on a sandbar and thus were
brought together in this one spot. The many broken shells and the
manner of their overlapping, one shell upon another, would make
such an explanation plausible.

Despite their abundance, however, well preserved turtle specimens,
while not rare, are found only occasionally. Crocodiles are also com-
mon and in the collection made there are no less than nine skulls, two
of which are associated with much of their skeletons. A considerable
variety of lizards is known from the Bridger and of these small
reptiles several specimens of a fragmentary nature were collected.

The value of the collection was greatly increased through the coop-
eration of Dr. W. H. Bradley of the United States Geological Sur-
vey, who secured the necessary field data from which he will prepare

a scale map on which all of the more important finds will be accu-
rately located. This mapping, combined with the several geological
sections measured by him, insures the accurate placement both geo-
logically and geographically of the specimens collected. This phase
of the work should be of the utmost importance in making this a basic
collection for the more exact determination of the faunal zones as
well as assisting in a more precise correlation of the horizons with
those of the other Tertiary basins of the Rocky Mountain region. So
far as I am aware never before in the work on the Bridger formation
has a paleontologist had the cooperation of a trained geologist in these
determinations, and it is felt that the final results will prove of great
importance.
THE SEARCH FOR ANCIENT LIFE FORMS IN THE
ROCKS OF THE WESTERN UNITED STATES

By CHARLES: E: RESSER;
Curator of Stratigraphic Paleontology, U. S. National Museum

The geologist, in his endeavors to obtain the minutiae that will even-
tually yield an understanding of the laws of his science, must spend
many hours of patient toil climbing steep mountains, penetrating deep
canyons, or tramping the bare expanses of deserts. From year to year
he must take advantage of favorable weather and of every other oppor-
tunity to seek details for completing the picture he is attempting
to draw.

My quest for facts to assist in depicting earth conditions that pre-
vailed when the earliest life record was in the making took me over
a considerable part of the western United States during the field sea-
son of 1930. Two general problems were chosen for attack. In view
of the increasing interest of geologists in the earliest forms of life
on the earth as well as the role played by algae as rock makers, the
purpose of the first explorations of the season was to study the
ancient sedimentary rocks exposed in the Grand Canyon of the Colo-
rado River. The search for organic remains in these old, relatively
unmetamorphosed sediments was particularly desired by Dr. David
White, Research Associate of the Carnegie Institution, in conjunction
with his studies at the Grand Canyon, and it was through his arrange-
ments with the Carnegie Institution and the National Park Service
that the trip was made possible.

The second general field of inquiry to be given consideration was
Cambrian geology, in which I am especially interested and which I had
previously studied in the Great Basin and the Rocky Mountains to
the north. As I had never seen the geology of Arizona, it was with
eagerness that I seized the opportunity to make a hurried visit to most
of the more important Cambrian exposures in that state.

In order to do the contemplated work in the Grand Canyon before
hot summer weather, I left Washington May 13. At the Grand Can-
yon, I found everything in readiness. The party consisted of Dr. A. A.
Stoyanow, of the University of Arizona, and myself as geologists, with
Ernest Appling as guide and Howard Childers as packer. Upon the
arrival of Doctor Stoyanow we immediately crossed the Canyon to
the North Rim. We planned to traverse the narrow peninsula which

separates the head of Bright Angel Creek, up which the Kaibab trail
leads to the North Rim, from the pass into Nankoweap Creek, where
our field investigations were to be conducted. However, as the winter
snow still lay deep in the woods, offering too much difficulty for laden
pack animals, our plans had to be changed. Doctor Stoyanow and J,
with food and equipment, were transported by a Park Service auto-
mobile 90 miles to South Canyon. Meanwhile our riding and unladen
pack animals were driven by a straighter route through the forest to
the rendezvous.

In order to understand this narrative more fully, both the geography
and the geologic structure of the Grand Canyon must be called to
mind. The Grand Canyon of the Colorado is developed where the
river cuts deeply into almost horizontal strata on the flanks of the
Kaibab Plateau, the higher portions of which attain an elevation of
9,500 feet above sea-level. As this mountainous mass was bowed up,
the river, which previously probably followed a rather straight south-
west course, was forced to make a wide sweep to the east, where, after
notching into the surface, it cut the canyon. As a consequence, the
Grand Canyon is now a great curved gorge.

Work in the canyon is very difficult. Besides the obstacle of its
vast depth, the harder horizontal strata everywhere form cliffs, and
since several of the geologic formations are rather thick, these vertical
faces often reach several thousand feet in height. However, a thou-

sand foot cliff is not needed to stop one’s progress—a vertical wall

only a few feet high, adjacent to steep slopes, becomes unscalable when
the footing is insecure. The uplift of the Kaibab Plateau having
occurred rather gently, few breaks in the horizontal formations re-
sulted, and therefore weathering has not torn the rocks to pieces to
form talus slopes over which trails might be made. Furthermore, in
this dry region few side streams enter the river, particularly on the
south rim where the gentle dip of the beds carries all water southward
from the margins of the uplift. Therefore trails in the Grand Canyon
exist only where advantage can be taken of slight natural breaks, and
there only by the expenditure of considerable sums of money.

South Canyon, just east of the Park boundary and south of House
Rock Valley, is a small dry valley cutting into the Kaibab Plateau and
draining into the Marble Canyon. Our camp was made in the former
home of “ Uncle” Jim Owen; now a subsidiary National Forest
ranger station

and some of the claws of the 2,200 cougars he is
said to have killed are still seen tacked to the barn. In the cool Kaibab
forest nearby, deer as well as the big cats are exceedingly plentiful.

SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1930 25

We noted many scores of hoofs and other parts of deer killed in the
great slaughter of the previous fall.

The morning following our arrival, our pack train was organized
and we made our way through the juniper forests up into the pines
of the higher levels to the peculiar gap that breaks through most of
the thickness of the massive Kaibab limestone and Coconino sand-
stone which form the unscalable cliffs just under the rim of the Can-
yon. From this point into the Nankoweap Basin, we traversed a trail
built in 1881 by Major John W. Powell, then Director of the United
States Geological Survey, and used the following winter by Dr. Charles
D. Walcott, who succeeded Major Powell and who later became
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. Today there stands on the
South River a finely executed monument commemorating Major
Powell’s successful navigation of the Colorado River throughout the
Grand Canyon.

It is assumed by the general public, and even by most students, that
the geological history of the major national parks is well known.
Thousands of people from all over the world who visit these parks
each year seek an explanation of the things seen—rocks, fossils, ero-
sional features, or plants and animals. Notwithstanding this wide-
spread interest, little has been accomplished toward mastering the
geologic history of the Grand Canyon since the studies that resulted
from Major Powell’s and Doctor Walcott’s explorations 50 years ago.

As the Nankoweap trail has not been repaired since it was first
constructed, except casually by a prospector or two, travel was quite
precarious and at places even dangerous, especially for the pack ani-
mals. Fortunately no accidents happened, although several of the
animals had very narrow escapes from falling over the cliffs, which
at places drop away from the trail-side 3,000 feet. Nankoweap Creek
is the most easterly in the Grand Canyon National Park and hence
lies below Point Imperial. Its valley is variously referred to as a
valley or a basin, the latter designation being unusual for a tributary
to the Colorado in the canyon country. Nankoweap valley like its
near neighbors is basinlike in its openness, which simply reflects the
local structure. With the uplift of the Kaibab plateau, some faulting—
slipping of the strata along lines of weakness—took place. These
basins lie inside the row of buttes margining the river for many miles,
beginning at the up-river edge of the Kaibab Plateau and extending
below the mouth of the Little Colorado. The Colorado River cut its
channel beyond the fault, and erosion, operating in the usual manner
along the fault, produced a high ridge in the intervening space, which
was cut into rectangular buttes by the side washes. Nankoweap Creek,

SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1930 27

where it cuts across this block, has the usual steep canyon, but up-
stream it widens into a basin where softer rocks have been removed.
Doctor Walcott’s interpretation of this unorthodox fault is sometimes
questioned, but Doctor Stoyanow and I, after considerable discussion
of several alternatives, think Doctor Walcott is correct; in fact, we
found further corroborative evidence not mentioned in his publica-
tions.

Our chief task on this expedition was to search the rocks thoroughly
for traces of animal remains. As expected we found abundant im-
prints of delicate plant tissues and rather large masses of algal lime-
stones, but nothing that can really be regarded as animal, though the
limey and carbonaceous shales are fitted in every way to preserve a
record of the life extant in the waters by which the sediments were
deposited. Just what significance the barrenness of these sediments
has, 1s not yet apparent. We camped, without tents, in the channel of
Nankoweap Creek under a cutbank where one of the half-dozen siz-
able trees in the basin is located at the only campsite in the valley near
water. Each day the search for fossils was extended to new ground
so that almost every exposed bed was investigated in the eight days we
remained in this basin.

When we prepared to climb out of the Nankoweap basin, I did not
care to trust my notes or photographs to the mule but carried them in
my pack. Fourteen hours of strenuous work were required to climb the
vertical mile between our camp and the north rim, and to traverse the
15 miles of trail to the point on the road where the Park Service auto-
mobile could pick us up. Within the Canyon the last few days had
become quite hot, but on the north rim we found early spring, with
the snow bank just shoveled from the hotel porch and spread in the
sun for quicker melting. The crossing to the South Rim, which was
completed in a snow storm, seemed very cold, since we were outfitted
for the heat of the canyon depths.

Now that the Nankoweap trip was completed, Doctor Stoyanow
kindly arranged for use of the State Geological Survey automobile
to afford us means for a brief examination of other Arizona Cambrian
outcrops. This interesting journey began with the study of the Music
Mountain section west of Peach Springs. A day here showed us how
this section, which offhand would be assumed to coincide exactly with
its apparent continuation northward in the Grand Canyon, differs in
lithologic detail and relative thickness of beds. From Peach Springs
our course naturally led southeastward diagonally across the State, for
the older strata outcrop only along the northeastern edge of the old
basement rock mass forming the southwestern portion of the State.

SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1930 29

The rocks in this old land mass are quite similar to the gneisses in the
inner gorge of the Grand Canyon, and must have furnished the
material now composing much of the Cambrian and subsequent strata
offshore to the north.

The Cambrian series exposed in Music Mountain outcrops south-
eastward for a short distance, extending perhaps to the vicinity of
Seligman. In the middle portion of the above-mentioned diagonal
boundary of the sedimentary plateaus, no Cambrian is present, and a
much younger series of beds rests directly on the ancient weathered
rock surface. Southeastward from Globe, however, Cambrian sedi-
ments reappear, but contain no beds correlative with the Grand Canyon
sequence. Doctor Stoyanow had worked out these general strati-
graphic facts by years of patient work and it was a great privilege and
pleasure to have him point out the evidence on which he based his
conclusions.

In a trip across Arizona, it is interesting, especially to one who has
not previously seen the southwest, to note how very sensitive the flora
is to elevation. The various cacti seem to have exact physiologic re-
quirements, and therefore even a low hill will often rise above the
level required by a conspicuous cactus. Another exceedingly interest-
ing experience was a visit to Natural Bridge, which is situated not far
from the villages of Pine and Payson. Here one finds both unusual
geologic features and interesting human activities. A deep, V-shaped
canyon was cut by a small stream flowing apparently along a fault
zone, as the rock series in the two walls of the canyon are not the
same. Several large springs issue from the east side of the canyon
several hundred feet above its bottom. Algae living in the abundant
waters from these springs have precipitated enormous quantities of
lime, until a level fill several hundred feet deep and 25 acres in extent
was formed across the canyon. Subsequently, the creek dissolved a
channel through this fill, thereby forming a large natural bridge. More
than 50 years ago a Scotch family occupied this level tract which is
naturally very fertile but almost completely shut off from the world.
Mrs. Goodfellow, the wife of the original settler, is still living, and
it is very interesting to hear her accounts of the early days. Fruit
trees of many sorts were planted when the Goodfellows first arrived.
An apricot tree planted 52 years ago beside one of the irrigation ditches
apparently found its situation most favorable. Its trunk is now more
than 3 feet in diameter, with a spread of branches exceeding 100 feet,
and this summer the tree bore approximately 100 bushels of fruit.
After an extended survey the Los Angeles papers are reported to have
admitted that this is the largest apricot tree in the world!
30 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

About the middle of June I returned to the Grand Canyon, where
the Park Service again kindly put at my disposal equipment and ani-
mals. I now had the pleasure of studying the well exposed rocks along
the Kaibab and Bright Angel Trails. This work was done in conjunc-
tion with Edwin McKee, the efficient Park Naturalist, who is carrying
forward investigations that will contribute much to our deficient
knowledge of Grand Canyon geology.

My journey to Salt Lake City was made via San Francisco, where
I examined certain type specimens in the University of California
collections.

At Salt Lake City, I was joined by Dr. Riuji Endo of Mukden,
Manchuria, who was to accompany me during the remainder of the
season. After organizing for camping, we went to Delta, Utah, pre-
paratory to a trip into the Utah desert. Here we were joined by
Mr. Frank Beckwith, editor of the local paper, who is greatly inter-
ested in the geology of his country. At this point the unusual weather
of the season began to impress itself upon us. During May and June
rains fell when none were due, but the departure from normal was
not so great as to attract more than passing notice. The past several
years had been dry throughout all the west and consequently rain was
greatly desired. At Delta much rejoicing was apparent when heavy
rain began to fall particularly on the watersheds that fed the irriga-
tion canals. Cloudy, threatening weather attended our departure into
the desert, making the temperatures very comfortable where we ex-
pected to experience the usual burning heat.

In the House Range Mr. Beckwith took us to Antelope Springs, a
small permanent flow of water near the fossiliferous outcrops studied
many years ago by Doctor Walcott. After reviewing these sections
we crossed the range by Marjum Pass and then followed the usual
rough desert track that by courtesy is called a road. Travel was
exceedingly rough as heavy showers had either washed ridges of dirt
and stones across the road or cut parallel grooves.

Saturday evening we reached Ibex in the Confusion Range. Mr.
Beckwith introduced us to Jack Watson who has lived there for many
years, mostly alone. No springs or streams occur here, as the nearby
ranges do not attain the height of 10,000 feet necessary to cause
sufficient precipitation to insure springs. Consequently Mr. Watson
must depend solely on rain water captured in tanks formed by dams
across gullies. When we arrived we found that he had no water left
in his tanks, since the regular spring showers had not materialized, nor
had the rains that began ten days previously in the higher mountains
to the east yet spread this far into the desert. He was particularly

annoyed a few days earlier by having a heavy shower pass within a
few miles of the bare rock expanse that catches most of his water.
Consequently he had to get up each morning at 2:30 and haul water
in barrels on a truck from Wah-Wah Spring, 31 miles away for 33
head of cattle! Information he was able to give us and the fact that
our engine was functioning perfectly caused us to risk a reduction of
our car’s water supply and we gave one of the cows 9 gallons.

Upon returning from our investigations in the desert ranges, we
decided to visit the nearby Zion National Park. Quite unexpectedly
we found that, as in the Algonkian rocks of the Grand Canyon, the
much younger sediments in Zion Canyon also lack fossils except algal
limestones.

The final field for investigations before beginning our homeward
journey lay in the vicinity of the Yellowstone Park plateaus. Conse-
quently we went north from Zion by way of Bryce Canyon and the
Sevier Valley through the Salt Lake region, then by way of Star Val-
ley to the Tetons.

From about the 24th of July onward the rains that had been increas-
ing in frequency all summer began to interfere with our travel and
work. In the Teton Range, where last season not a drop of rain fell
all summer, it was almost continuous. Our tents were wet for weeks
at a time. Finally rain became so frequent and so violent that few
roads remained open. For this reason we abandoned our attempts
to reach several localities and went northward away from the high
regions. During our investigations in the Tetons and the Yellowstone
we were accompanied by Dr. Curt Teichert and Mrs. Teichert of
Freiburg, Germany.

Our final studies in the Rocky Mountains were in the Beartooth
Range near Red Lodge, Montana, where Princeton University has
begun geologic studies. Scarcely another region in North America
exhibits such varied geology, and if researches are continued for a
sufficient length of time, important results may be expected. This
appears to be the focal point where the Rocky Mountains change their
general type of structure, and the extensive Yellowstone Plateau with
its lava flows ends, joining both the central and northern types of
ranges, and where the results of glacial, erosional, and other geologic
processes are clearly exhibited.

ley, Idaho, in 1929, were so encouraging that it was decided to con-
tinue operations for another season or two. Accordingly, early in
May, 1930, preparations were made to resume work at the site of our
former collecting ground.

For five days, rain, snow, and general bad weather held our party
in the little town of Hagerman, Idaho. But on May 9, high winds and
a brilliant sun gave promise of drying up the county roads sufficiently
to make possible a move into camp, and no time was lost in loading
a two ton truck with camp equipment, a week’s supply of rations,
boxes, lumber, and about 30 gallons of water. Our trusty Ford was
also loaded with baggage and lighter material, and we were soon on
our way. Our objective, a camp site at the edge of the desert near
the fossil bone deposit worked last year, was only two miles in an air
line from Hagerman, but there intervened the canyon of the deep
and swiftly flowing Snake River, and on its bank to the west a sloping
sandy escarpment of over 600 feet elevation above the river bed. To
reach this camp, therefore, it was necessary to cross the river on the
main highway bridge about four miles south of Hagerman and make
a detour of about 25 miles over a hilly and little-used country road
through the border of the desert country. Part of this route was over
a portion of the picturesque Old Oregon Trail, hallowed by the strug-
gles and privations of a pioneer people opposed by the stubbornly
waged warfare of the Indians, who were fighting for their beloved
lands and hunting grounds. Over this trail during the following weeks
we made our biweekly trips to town for water, supply provisions, and
materials as they were needed. I learned from the early settlers in
the region that this was a particularly hazardous stretch of trail in
the early days. Here the old trail left the river to wind its way up the
steep divides to the top of the plain about 5 miles to the west, whence
it continued westward over a dry sage-brush-covered desert to the
next place where water was to be found, a total distance between
watering places of over 20 miles. In these days of automobiles this
journey is so easily accomplished that the word hardship does not
occur in connection with it.

3ut not so with the early users of the trail. To them it was a real
hardship to be overcome. [ven for the stage coach, drawn by four or
occasionally six light horses, it was a long and tedious day’s travel.
And for the heavier loaded and slower moving emigrant and freight
outfits a single day did not suffice for the journey. It was their cus-
tom, I was told, to divide their wagon trains at the Snake River, tak-
ing one half up the first five miles of heavy climb to the top of the
divide and leaving them there for the night, while the oxen or horses

were taken back to the river to bring on the remainder of the wagons
early the next morning, when the journey through the sandy sage
brush country to the next water hole was resumed. The necessity of
breaking up the wagon trains at this point naturally weakened their
defense against attack by hostile Indians. This fact was evidently
recognized and taken advantage of by the latter, for it was here some
of their most successful attacks were made. It was said that here one
whole emigrant train was surrounded and burned. Mute evidence of
the tragedy is still perceptible in the form of occasional pieces of
wagon irons that may be found scattered through the sage brush near

the top of the hill. I here secured for the National Museum’s histori-
cal collection three of the old cast iron hub-thimbles.

Our party this year included Mr. C. P. Singleton, chief field assis-
tant; Mr. S. P. Welles, graduate student of the University of Cali-
fornia; Mr. Frank Garnier, cook and camp assistant ; and as occasion
permitted Mr. Elmer Cook, the discoverer of the fossil bone deposit.
After a week’s service Mr. Garnier was replaced by Mr. J. Young
Rogers as camp man.

Camp established, the work of the summer began where we left off
the previous season in the development of the fossil bone deposit.
This deposit is situated at the southern extremity of a short hill or
spur that juts out from the border of the plain, about a quarter of a
mile from our camp and about 45 to 60 feet below the top of the
hill. (See fig. 28.) It is evidently the remnant of a stream channel
deposit made up of cross-bedded layers of coarse and fine sand with
occasional pebbles and here and there patches and lenses of almost pure
clay, forming a part of the horizontally laminated beds of the Idaho
formation. hese beds reached a thickness of several hundred feet and
at one time extended many miles in every direction, completely occupy-
ing the area now excavated by erosion to form the Snake River Valley
of this region, and the present day rough terrain to the west and
south of Hagerman. The bone deposit was evidently at the time of
its formation a boggy, springy terrain, perhaps a drinking place for
wild animals in a semi-arid country where water holes were not abun-
dant. This assumption is based on the general character of the de-
posits as stated, and the fact that it contains the bones of literally
hundreds of animals, mostly belonging to an extinct species of horse.
For the most part the bones are disarticulated, intermingled, and
scattered in a way to suggest that they represent the slow accumula-
tion of many years rather than the sudden overwhelming of a large
herd in one grand catastrophe. Springs and swampy conditions are
indicated from the fact that there are in the deposits the remains of
frogs, fish, swamp turtles, beavers, and other water living animals,
and abundant evidence of vegetation as shown by remnants of coarse
grass stems, leaves, and even small pieces of wood. The best evidence
of the former presence of springs is the fact that numerous pebbles
are found scattered throughout many of the layers of both coarse and
fine sand, although there are no distinct layers of gravel. In the lower
stratum of this deposit the sand is heavily stained and many of the
fossil bones are encrusted and stained with light accumulations of bog
iron.

38 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

Regardless of its origin, two seasons’ work has developed the fact
that this fossil bone deposit is one of the important discoveries in the
field of vertebrate paleontology of recent years. The outcome of these
operations by the Smithsonian Institution parties has been most grati-
fying. As already stated the principal yield of the deposit consists of
abundant remains of a hitherto unknown species of horse belonging to
the rare genus Plesippus, an animal which stands directly intermedi-
ate between the horses of the Pleistocene and present day, and the
three-toed kinds of still more ancient time. The material collected from
this deposit in the two seasons includes more than 40 more or less
complete skulls and sufficient bones of other parts of the body to
restore at least three or four entire skeletons. The bones collected
represent all stages of growth of both sexes from embryo to old age.
Thus they afford an unusual opportunity for a systematic study of
the species, especially in reference to the limits of individual and sex
variations.

Other fossil remains found associated with the much more abundant
horse material were those of a large beaver, an otter, a mastodon, a
large peccary, a rodent of the muskrat group, a frog, a swamp turtle,
and a small fish. From exposures of the same formation in the gen-
eral vicinity were also collected remains of these and additional extinct
species of mammals, the latter including several species of rodents, a
large cat, two species of camel, and a small ground sloth. These,
together with the animal remains of the fossil bone deposit, when
studied, will give rather definite evidence regarding the true age of
this mass of sedimentary accumulation to which has been given the
name Idaho formation. Vhis formation has hitherto been regarded
by some authorities as belonging to the Pleistocene, or so-called Ice
Age, and by others as representing the upper member of the next older
geologic period, the Pliocene. The preliminary study of the fossils
collected by our party in the Hagerman locality seems strongly to favor
the placing of their age as Upper Pliocene. This marks their time of
deposition as not less than a million years ago.

To the fossil hunter such a deposit as the one here described is of
much more than passing interest. First there is a satisfaction in work-
ing out a successful technique for collecting and preparing the bones
for shipment to the laboratory; and there is the added keen pleasure
of anticipation and expectation, as foot after foot and yard after yard
of undisturbed ground is worked over, that the next bone to be dis-
covered and developed will prove to be new to science or at least a
better specimen than has before been found of an already known
species. Such collecting also has its monotonous and prosaic side. At

the Hagerman locality it is often necessary to spend hours and even
days in just plain shoveling of many cubic yards of sand to come to
the bone-bearing layer. Once reached the bones are for the most part
well mineralized, or petrified, and although more or less scattered are
usually complete. But often the separate bones are much broken or
cracked up, especially where they have lain for a long time near the
surface of the sloping hillside from which they outcrop. This neces-
sitates working very carefully around each bone, as developed, and
giving many of them special treatment to prevent their being pulled
apart in removing them from the loose sandy bed.

The first care, therefore, was to make long strippings to remove the
overburden from the bone bearing layers. Then as the bones were
uncovered one by one or in groups and brushed clean on top and sides,
the cracks and soft places were saturated with a thin solution of gum
arabic (acasia). Following this treatment, as their condition and the
collector’s experience suggested, they had to be still further protected
by pasting them with strips of burlap dipped in raw flour paste or
thin plaster of paris. This, when dry, forms a light, tough jacket
which securely holds each piece in its original position, and the speci-
men then may be turned over and the jacket completed on the lower
side to finish its preparation for packing and shipping. For skulls and
articulated sections this method had to be followed in nearly every
case. In certain sections in the deposit the bones instead of being sur-
rounded by a soft sandy mass, were completely incased with a nodular
or concretionary formation of varying thickness of very hard sand-
stone that is very tenacious and most difficult to break free from the
bone without injuring its surface. Sometimes the bones were thus so
deeply and solidly embedded as to make them almost worthless as
specimens.
FURTHER INVESTIGATIONS ON EVIDENCE OF
BAREY MAN IN FLORIDA

By JAMES W. GIDLEY,

Assistant Curator of Mammalian Fossils, U. S. National Museum

Following the controversy raised in scientific circles several years
ago by the discoveries of Dr. E. H. Sellards at Vero, Florida, regard-
ing the antiquity of man in that region, the Smithsonian Institution
has conducted a series of investigations at various localities along the
east coast of Florida, but principally at Melbourne and Vero. The
results of these expeditions, which were placed under my charge, have
been reported on from season to season, the last report appearing in
last year’s number of this publication, Thanks to an extension of the
kind generosity of Mr. Childs Frick, who for the past few seasons has
shared with the Smithsonian the expenses of these expeditions, work
in Florida was continued this year.

Melbourne was again chosen as the base of operations, and during
the greater part of February and March Mr. C. P. Singleton, my chief
field assistant of former years, and I carried on explorations, excavat-
ing considerable areas especially at Melbourne and other nearby locali-
ties. Fair success crowned our efforts, though perhaps not to the
same degree as on some of our former expeditions. The most impor-
tant discoveries of the season at the Melbourne locality included the
finding of two artifacts under circumstances that constitute additional
evidence of early man in Florida. The first of these is a crudely
formed arrow or spear point found by Mr. Singleton in situ in the
undisturbed upper layer of the fossil-bone-bearing deposit known as
“bed No. 2” of Sellards. It was lying directly under one of the large
bones of a poorly preserved skeleton of a mastodon.

The other artifact is a small bone awl taken from the undisturbed
sand of the No. 2 bed somewhat below its middle section. In both
instances the excavated areas were originally covered with a few feet
of loose but characteristically stratified swamp deposit composed of
alternating layers of sand, leaf mould, and swamp muck, positive evi-
dence that the artifacts were a part of the formation in which they
were found and not to be accounted for on the assumption of later
intrusions. Several good specimens also were added to our growing
collection of fossil mammal bones from this locality.

During the season we had occasion to examine a reported find of
mammoth and mastodon bones on a truck farm near the ocean below
St. Augustine. Here we found that the workmen, under the direction
of the son of the farm foreman, had excavated the large part of a
skeleton of the mammoth, but as they then planned to keep the speci-
men for private exhibit we did no excavating there and returned to
Melbourne. The most important work done other than at Melbourne
was along the St. Lucie Canal, about 12 miles east of Lake Okeechobee
near Indiantown. Here we secured a well preserved pair of lower
jaws and a few other parts of a mammoth, and did sufficient develop-
ment work to determine that the general geologic structure is the
same as that at Vero and Melbourne. The formation underlying the
No. 2 bed in the Indiantown locality, however, seems to vary in
character more than at Melbourne, where marine shells form the
greater part of the mass. At Indiantown large masses of sand under-
lie thin layers of shells or in certain areas replace them entirely. The
item of greatest value, perhaps, resulting from our work in this lo-
cality, was the finding of a molar tooth of one of the more primitive
mastodons. This tooth came from a consolidated bed of sand about
20 feet below the present surface of the land and underlying a thin
shell layer of supposedly older age than our fossil-bearing beds known
as the Melbourne or No. 2 bed formation. The mastodon tooth in
question is of the type of those found commonly in the Pliocene, and
thus implies either that the lower strata of the fossil beds at Indian-
town are Pliocene in age, or that here in Florida this particular species
of mastodon lived on into the Pleistocene, or still more probably, the
tooth may have been redeposited, in the place where found, from an
older deposit of Pliocene age.

This and other interesting problems in connection with the early
history of Florida remain still to be solved, and it is only by a con-
tinuation of systematic work similar to that which the Smithsonian
Institution has been carrying on for the past few years that this can
be done.
COLERPCHING SILVER’ MINERALS IN ONLARIO;
CANADA

By EDWARD P. HENDERSON,
Assistant Curator of Geology, U. S. National Museum

For the purpose of acquiring a series of silver minerals for exhibi-
tion, I left Washington late in August on a collecting trip into the
Province of Ontario, Canada, the National Museum’s collections being
badly in need of material from the rich silver camps of this nearby
region. Practically the entire month of September was spent in north-
ern Ontario, and it would be difficult to select a more delightful sea-
son in which to visit this magnificent country.

At Toronto I spent several days in inspecting the collections at the
Royal Ontario Museum of Mineralogy, selecting exchange material,
and consulting with the mineralogists of the staff as to the best areas
and mines to visit.

Leaving Toronto, I first visited the Cobalt district some 300 miles
north, where the country in general is rather rough with many rocky
ridges, between which are lakes, swampy wastes, or agricultural low-
lands. These lowlands and therefore the streams, lakes, and high-
ways generally lie in a north and south direction. There is abundant
timber, mostly spruce, birch, balsam, and jack pine. Many forests have
been swept by devastating fires leaving only charred stumps stand-
ing; in other areas, where more time has elapsed since the fires or
original clearing for lumber, a dense, almost jungle-like growth has
taken possession, the new growth being less suitable for lumber than
the original stand of virgin timber.

Previous to 1903 the area around Cobalt consisted of wooded land
which served as a source for lumber and constituted a natural bar-
rier to the agricultural lands farther north, but in that year, during
the excavating for the Temiskaming and Northern Railroad, narrow
veins of phenomenally high silver values were discovered. The silver
content was so great that trained engineers who came to examine the
find thought that the quantity could not be large because of its rich
quality but time has proved these conclusions to be erroneous. The
history of this celebrated silver camp is very dramatic and has been
told so often that it need not be repeated here.

The silver veins vary from minute seams up to a thickness of ten
inches. In places the veins are almost solid silver and again the metal

occurs as a fine network of delicate veins or small irregular masses in
both calcite and cobaltite.

As simple a statement of the geology as can be given is that when
this basic rock, called Nipissing diabase, was intruded into the older
rocks, fractures were developed along the contacts and in these frac-
tures the ore was undoubtedly deposited by solution originating in the
cdiabase.

A large irregular mass of silver found at the Keeley Mines, Silver
Centre, Ontario, was exactly the type of material needed for our exhi-
bition, provided some of the ragged appendages which marred the
symmetry of the specimen could be removed. This operation developed
into a thrilling experience. Hammering, even with a sledge, made no
impression except a small bruise on account of the toughness of the
silver. Finally, in despair, the mine captain suggested a shot of dyna-
mite. Two sticks were plastered on the side of the specimen under a
damp blanket of sand, the fuse was lighted, and we retreated to safe
quarters to await the report. And what a report it was! Strangely
enough very little silver was removed. One small fragment made a
non-stop flight through the side of the mill house and several windows
in nearby buildings were shattered, but most important, from my point
of view at least, was the small crack which had just started through
the specimen. Smaller charges of dynamite were carefully placed and
exploded and little by little the irregular silver prongs were removed.
Perhaps few geologists have had the experience of trimming such a
precious sample by so unique and striking a method.

The next district visited was Sudbury, the most important nickel
district in the world. Much of the region surrounding the city of Sud-
bury is practically barren of vegetation and perhaps to the tourist
appears as a desolate waste, but to the geologist it is an admirable ex-
posure of a series of interesting rocks. The igneous rock in which the
nickel ore is found is a norite, this intruded rock forming a laccolithic
sheet some 36 miles long and approximately 17 miles wide. This
nickel eruptive was intruded under a thick blanket of older sediments
and the slow cooling permitted the ore minerals to separate out
towards the bottom of the laccolith. The ore is monotonously uni-
form in character over much of the district. It consists of pyrrhotite,
pentlandite, and chalcopyrite, and appreciable quantities of platinum
metals are also recovered from the ore body.

A rather rapid series of visits was made to a number of the different
pegmatite dykes in this province, resulting in the acquisition of sev-
eral rather recently described minerals which were lacking in the
48 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

National Museum’s collections. These pegmatite dykes are located in
two rather widely separated districts surrounding Parry Sound and
farther east toward Bancroft. Several large and a few small specimens
were collected which are now in the Museum’s exhibit.

The success of the trip was due in a large measure to the hearty
cooperation of mining companies, quarry owners, and of the staff of
the Royal Ontario Museum of Mineralogy.
APL ED RWitih, ik BIRDS OF NORTHERN, SPAIN
By ALEXANDER WETMORE,

Assistant Secretary, Smithsonian Institution

Landing in the little seaport of Vigo in northwestern Spain late in
the evening of April 23, 1930, I was awakened at dawn the following
morning by the cheerful twittering of swallows at my window, the
first species of living bird seen on a continent whose life was entirely
new to me. Formalities for the entry of my scientific equipment were
soon completed, thanks to arrangements made by the American Am-
bassador to Spain, the Honorable Irwin B. Laughlin, a Regent of the
Smithsonian Institution, and ina few hours I was en route for Madrid,
where through the same interested official necessary permits for field
collecting were granted.

As an introduction to what was in store for me, friends at the
Museo Nacional de Ciencias Naturales arranged an excursion into
the nearby pine forests of the Sierra de Guadarrama where I spent
three days quartered in the Estacion Alpina de Biologia at a little
more than 5,000 feet above the sea. In spite of almost continuous
snow and rain I found here numerous birds, including among others
two species of titmice, the nuthatch, robin, stone-chat, hedge sparrow,
and goldcrest, all common birds but of keen interest to one who had
not before seen them alive.

Field work began in earnest on arrival at the little town of Puente
de los Fierros at an elevation of 1,800 feet above the sea on the north
slope of the Sierra Cantabrica, the great range of rugged mountains
that as a continuation of the Pyrenees extends across northern Spain.
The town lay in a deep valley that led up to the Pajares Pass, with the
lower slopes divided by stone fences or lines of brush into pastures
and cultivated fields frequently pitched at an angle of 45°, while wind-
ing lanes crossing the hill slopes led to higher levels grown with brush
and occasional groves of trees. The country people told me that I had
brought spring, as the grass became green, fruit trees blossomed, and
violets and other spring flowers appeared during the few days that I
was there.

Trees in Spain are as much a crop as grass, and impress one as
having a hard and cheerless life. The forests in the Cantabrians are
principally of oak and chestnut, growing to a diameter of four to six
feet, there being no native pine in this range of mountains. The tops

and larger limbs are cut off 20 to 30 feet from the ground, leaving the
huge trunks grotesquely gnarled and twisted to stand in irrregular
array, a hobgoblin woodland that often appears dark and gloomy with
little animal life in evidence. When new shoots grow from the pol-
larded trunks these are cut at intervals of a few years until with the
passing of time decay creeps in through these repeated wounds, the
tree trunk gives up the uneven battle with man, and is finally cut down
and made into fire wood, Extensive forests are distant from the
towns and in the better settled regions are of little area.

Travel along the numerous footpaths at Fierros ordinarily was
not difficult, except that one was continually climbing or descending,
but the intervening slopes were steep and high so that collecting speci-
mens was attended with considerable labor. The higher slopes had
huge exposures of massive rock while far beyond were peaks covered
with snow. Trees and bushes along the rushing streams of the lower
valleys were half in leaf but a thousand feet above on exposed slopes
the winds blew chill and buds were barely opening.

Small birds were common, particularly in the shrubbery along the
lower footpaths. The wren, a counterpart of our winter wren, sang
gaily from tangles of weeds and brush, searching for holes in which
to place its nest. The chiff-chaff, an Old World warbler of tiny size,
sang its insistent song from low trees while hunting busily for insects
in company with the black-cap, a larger species of the same family,
with more musical song and quieter movements. The meadow bunt-
ing, a sparrow with gray and black streaked head, was found in pairs
through the open pastures, and on occasion I found its more brilliant
relative, the yellow-hammer. Both are like our crowned sparrows in
habit. Titmice were found in profusion ranging from the delicately
colored blue tit to the slender bodied long-tailed tit, five species rang-
ing through the same thickets and woodlands.

Boarding the Mixrto one morning—a train that carried both pas-
sengers and freight—I arrived within a short time at the little village
of Busdongo on the northern side of the Pajares Pass at an elevation
of about 4,300 feet with the summit of the pass a few hundred feet
above. In the valleys here were little squares of cultivated fields and
pastures separated by rock fences, and above, slopes covered with
green grass or mats of heather and gorse. Banks of snow lay every-
where, their melting feeding the little streams, and the higher hills were
entirely white except where naked rock projected in rough, angular
spires and massive blocks of cold, blue-gray stone. Flowers. dotted
the meadows, clear bird notes and songs came to the ear, and over all

lay a golden sunshine bathing the world with a warm light that miti-
gated the chill of breezes blowing over the snowbanks. Pajares Pass,
the frontier of the ancient kingdom of Asturias from which I had just
come, was a sharply cut dividing line between the better watered brush-
and tree-grown slopes descending steeply to the northern coastal plain
toward Oviedo, and the more arid gradual decline toward the broad
plains of Leon on the north with scattered mats of low brush as the
principal woody vegetation.

In this world of open mountain slopes and meadows, birds were
abundant. Chaffinches, pipits, and yellow-hammers were everywhere.
Whin-chats and stone-chats were common, and skylarks sang above
the higher meadows, appearing as tiny specks hovering high against
a sky of the clearest blue. Wheat-ears followed stone fences or rocky
ledges, and white wagtails were found along the rough stream beds.
The latter, called locally Javanderas (washerwomen) because like the
native laundresses they had their principal activities along the streams,
on alighting after a short flight twitched their long tails rapidly a
dozen times and then stood motionless. On the rocky slopes above
were found occasional rock thrushes singing clearly from open ledges,
and approached only by arduous climbing. With them were alpine
accentors, cousins of the little hedge sparrows that abounded in the
matted brush above the valleys. One morning among the higher ridges
a curious birdeall came for a time without visible source, until finally
I located a black shadow moving along the mountain slope far below
and, tracing it to its source toward the sun, saw a crowlike bird sweep-
ing in bounds and circles over the mountain ridges. The binoculars
revealed the curved red bill of a chough, and I watched its graceful
evolutions for some time with keen delight.

The heat of the city of Leén in the lowlands was almost oppressive
after the sharper air of the mountains, and after a day during which
I visited the cathedral, with jackdaws and merlins flying about its
huge tower, I was pleased to continue by auto to Cistierna and from
there to the inland village of Riano located in an open valley among
mountains at an elevation of 3,500 feet. The little fonda where I
obtained quarters was clean and comfortable, the people of the village
were friendly, and the weather was pleasant ; and I was told again that
spring had arrived in my company. Buds were already opening on
the trees near the village, and during the next two weeks leaves grew
apace until the lower slopes were entirely green and buds were burst-
ing on the trees at the upper edge of the forests.

At Riafo the Esla and Yuso rivers joined in a large stream abound-
ing in trout. The open valleys were cultivated, while the slopes of the

hills were given to the grazing of herds of sheep, goats, and cattle.
On many of the lower slopes were extensive forests of oak, beech,
and chestnut, while above were open meadows dotted with low mats

clustered in little towns and villages, where their houses of stone with
roofs of tile and slate huddled closely together. Daily men and women
went out to tend their flocks or work their fields so that there were
few country habitations.

In the village, storks built huge nests in poplar trees, with one on
the tower of a little church, wagtails nested under loose tiles in the
roofs, and chaffinches and bright colored linnets chattered gaily.
Northward migration among the smaller birds was in full course so
that daily there were new arrivals. The song of the cuckoo—of which
the striking of the cuckoo clock is so exact an imitation—was heard
through the hills, with the rolling calls of the green woodpecker and
the harsh notes of jays that inhabited the scrub and seldom came into
the open.

As days passed excursions were made steadily farther afield. Below
the pass known as the Collado de Terguena was a fine forest of beech
with the trees so heavily hung with moss that small birds were seen
among the branches with difficulty. In the Sierra de Ormas was a
great woodland of oak and chestnut as yet largely untouched by the
ax of the woodchopper. From the snow-covered slopes above there
was a wonderful view across wild, uninhabited mountain country in
which wolves, wild boars, and bears were reputed to range. From the
more distant Sierra del Ponton I had a view of the jagged Picos de
Europa, the highest points in the Cantabrian Range, inaccessible
however until later in the season because of the depth of snow in the
intervening mountain passes. Work here was finally concluded because
of the necessities of a schedule including other duties, though another
month might have been profitably spent in this area.

From Riafo I continued by motor to Cangas de Onis toward the
north, passing through a remarkably deep and narrow defile, cut in
places to a depth of more than 1,500 feet, at times with barely room for
a stream and the auto road at the bottom, with cliffs rising precipi-
tously on either hand. Field work was at an end; the interesting col-
lections of specimens included a number of local races of birds new
to the collections of the National Museum, where the birds of Spain
had been previously almost unrepresented, and I came finally to
Santander and the French frontier with the hope that some future
journey might let me see more of the pleasant lands of Spain.

The Parish-Smithsonian Expedition to Haiti, organized by the late
Lee H. Parish, with the financial assistance and cooperation of his
father S. W. Parish, left Miami, Florida, in the 80-foot ketch-
rigged auxiliary yacht Esperanza, on February 15, 1930. In addition
to the two mentioned the party included Mrs. S. W. Parish, who
assisted in radio communication, in photography, and in other ways,
and Watson M. Perrygo of the staff of taxidermists of the United
States National Museum. Lee Parish served as captain and navigator
and head of the party, and in addition assisted his father and Perrygo
in collecting specimens, being indefatigable in his efforts to promote
the success of the work. The work of the expedition was concerned
with the collection of zoological material, particularly of birds and
reptiles. The Esperanza, thoroughly seaworthy, offered an excep-
tional opportunity for work on islands lying off the Haitian coast, and
it was to these little-worked areas that the major part of the time in
the field was directed.

The route to Haiti led along the north coast of Cuba with stops
for the collection of specimens at Gibara, Port Tanamo, and finally
at Baracoa. The first specimen of the expedition was a migrant
Maryland yellowthroat obtained as the Esperanza passed near Bimini
in the Bahamas. Numerous birds were obtained at Gibara, and in the
better watered region about Port Tanamo, with its dense forests, col-
lecting continued apace. Cayo Grande de Moa and the Moa and
Fabrico River were fruitful spots. Birds abounded, with trogons,
parrots, todies, and others of brilliant plumage giving a touch of color
to the daily bags of the collectors.

On March 9 after a delightful trip through waters where imagina-
tion might picture the passage of pirate ships and Spanish galleons of
earlier days, the Esperanza anchored in the harbor of the quaint tropi-
cal town of Baracoa. Bananas and cocoa-beans are the two chief
products here and the plantations from which they come are well
worth seeing. The party again set sail two nights later by the light

of a tropical moon, passed into the Windward Passage between Cuba
and Haiti, and then on March 13 anchored in the harbor at Port-
au-Prince.

After obtaining the necessary permits for scientific collecting
through the kind offices of Gen. J. H. Russell, American High Com-
missioner, and others, the Esperanza with Col. and Mrs. Coyle and
Lieut. Wirkus added to the party, crossed to Gonave Island, working
first at Petite Gonave, where the anchor was dropped in crystal clear
water in which schools of brilliantly colored fish swam among beauti-
ful coral formations.

Petite Gonave, east of La Gonave Island, has an area of approxi-
mately 15 acres, most of which is of a very sharply eroded limestone
formation, with the center a mangrove swamp. Dozens of rhinoceros
iguanas sunned themselves on the rocks, and when approached bobbed
their heads up and down, swelling their throats like the Anolis before
disappearing clumsily in the crevices of the rocks.

Gonave Island proper, more than 30 miles long and from 7 to 8
miles wide at the widest point, in general is arid and open, rising in
hills like those of Haiti opposite. Collections were made at the western
end and at Anse-a-Galets, the headquarters of the Gendarmerie for
the island. Native dances executed to the barbaric rhythm of wooden
drums with heads of hide stretched while green, and the weird and
mournful accompaniment of bamboo flutes added to the interest of the
work.

On March 23 the party returned to Port-au-Prince for supplies and
then, reduced to the original personnel, sailed for the Cayemite Islands
on the northern coast of the southern peninsula.

Ién route they anchored for a time in Baraderes Bay. After show-
ing credentials to the chief of the section at Grand Boucan, the collec-
tors crossed Baraderes Bay in one of the small boats to Mapou te
explore two caves for extinct animal bones. The first one was small
and very dry, and several tests there produced nothing. A barn owl
was shot, and ona shelf some human remains were found. The other
proved to be equally barren; it was a deep cave with water seeping
through the ceiling, the moisture destroying any bones that might have
been preserved there. Many birds were seen in the banana, cocoanut.
and mango trees.

An expedition on horseback up the fertile valley of Petite Trou de
Nippes, grown with royal and cocoanut palms, high bush cotton,
bananas and coffee, with the chief of the section as guide led to an-
other very large cave containing a pool of crystal-clear water, which
was said to have been used by natives as a place of worship. Birds,

reptiles, and mollusks were collected, and the natives captured 100
live lizards for exhibition in the National Zoological Park in Wash-
ington.

Grand Cayemite, the next stop, is a rather large island, rough and
rocky, with large patches of Madame Michel grass. Parrots and white-
winged doves were abundant. More detailed work was done on Petite
Cayemite, little or no collecting having been done there previously.
Petite Cayemite is a small island of roughly eroded limestone covered
with Madame Michel grass, which grows densely in some sections.
Travel was difficult, but the collectors were persistent, securing excel-
lent series of birds and reptiles, with some fine specimens of fish and
crustaceans.

On April 19 the Esperanza left for Ile 4 Vache, stopping for mail
at Jéremie, an old French town, and then sailed west along the coast
to Dame Marie. A rough sea forced the yacht to anchor for two days
in Bigie Bay, a small indentation on the extreme western end of the
peninsula. Fish, crustaceans, and other aquatic creatures were col-
lected at night by lowering a light over the side of the boat, attract-
ing hundreds to the surface where they were easily secured with a net.

After a brief lay-over at Aux Cayes for supplies, the Esperanza
anchored in Feret Bay, Ile a Vache Island, on April 27. This island
is approximately 8 miles long and 4 miles wide. Feret Bay is on the
west end, surrounded by sandy beaches, behind which large cocoanut
palms, cashew, and mango trees grow. The natives as a whole are
much healthier looking than the average Haitian of other regions and
are well-to-do through their crops of bananas, sugar cane, and sweet
potatoes as well as their cattle. Crocodiles were obtained from one
of the two lagoons on the western end of the island; lizards, boas and
vine snakes were very common; and over one hundred birds were
obtained. The island had previously been unknown zoologically.

Returning to Bigie Bay, under favorable weather conditions, the
Esperanza sailed 30 miles west to Navassa, an island seldom visited
by naturalists, or for that matter by others, except for the lighthouse
tender that comes to it periodically. Navassa is a rocky mass about
14 miles long, a 20-foot cliff around its entire shoreline making it
inaccessible except in Lulu Bay, a small indentation in the rocky wall
where there is a steel ladder leading down to the water. Because it
is exposed to the open sea, this little bay is unsafe for ships except in
the quiet seas of the early morning. The Esperanza anchored there
in the calm of the morning of May to. The island itself is uninhabited,
and is covered with low trees and thorny bushes. The rough, eroded

surface rock makes travel extremely difficult. Multitudes of red-
footed boobies and frigate birds nested and roosted everywhere, and
doves and a vireo were the common land birds. Lizards abounded,
and black marine iguanas were reported but were not found. A very
fair collection was made in the few hours that it was possible to
remain, though the blazing sun over the dry scrub nearly prostrated the
collectors.

On the return to Port-au-Prince a second stop was made at Petite
Gonave to secure living iguanas for the National Zoological Park. The
native fishermen who live there are very much afraid of these great
lizards, but said that they could be captured by putting rum in hollows
in the rocks where the iguanas would drink it, making it an easy matter
to catch and handle them, The six obtained however were captured
by hand, the dangerous attributes of these animals being wholly
imaginary.

The Esperanza sailed from Port-au-Prince for Miami on May 24,
leaving Mr. Perrygo to return a few days later on the steamer Ancon
to New York.

In its objective of collecting specimens on remote islands little
known zoologically the expedition was singularly successful, the many
specimens obtained, particularly of birds and reptiles, forming a valu-
able addition to the Haitian collections of the United States National
Museum. The birds will be the subject of a special report, and the
notes on the reptiles will be included in a complete account of the
herpetology of this region. The success of the work was due largely
to Mr. Lee H. Parish, who was responsible for the organization and
plan, and whose skill as a navigator, and resourcefulness under the
trying conditions of this type of travel in waters remote from facili-
ties and assistance, made possible the itinerary followed. He assisted
constantly in the zoological work, both in collecting and preparation,
in addition to his other duties. His untimely death a few months after
the close of the trip, on the eve of development of plans for further
work of a similar nature, is mourned by his many friends.
BIOLOGICAL -COELECTING ON ~ TEN-CAN: ISEAND”

BY HENRY (C) KELEERS;
Umted States Navy

Niuafoou Island in the Toga Archipelago, nicknamed “ Tin-Can
Island” for reasons explained later, the last independent kingdom
in the South Seas, was the site selected for the operations of the
1930 United States Naval Observatory Eclipse Expedition. Through
the courtesy of the Naval Observatory and the friendly cooperation of
the Navy Department, I was again detailed to act as representative
of the Smithsonian Institution for the purpose of making biological
collections. The expedition left San Francisco July 31 and arrived at
Tutuila, American Samoa, August 13. We remained at Samoa four
days while the U. S. S. Tanager was loaded with the 60 tons of stores
and scientific apparatus, and the 12,000 feet of lumber required in
setting up the various cameras and astronomical instruments. Leaving
Samoa August 18, we arrived off Niuafoou Island August 21. The
shore is rocky, with lava benches backed by cliffs 70 to 100 feet
high rising abruptly from the ocean. Landing on the lava rocks at
the village of Angaha was a most difficult feat, but luck was with us,
and the sea was calm for 48 hours, a very rare occurrence. All the
equipment, including the tube of the Einstein camera which weighed
T100 pounds, was transferred from the small boats to the lava rocks
with the assistance of the natives without accident. The equipment
was then hauled up a steep trail to the top of the cliff 70 feet high and
the camp site was located on the summit near the village of Angaha.

Niuafoou Island, pronounced New-ah-fo-oh, latitude 15° 33’ 52” S.,
and longitude 175° 37’ 46” W., was discovered by Captain Edwards
in the British Naval vessel Pandora, August 3, 1791, and named by
him Proby Island; it was afterwards named Good Hope Island by
the Dutch navigator Schouten, and is still so designated on the hydro-
graphic charts. The nickname “ Tin-Can Island” was given to it
from the unique method by which mail is delivered there. The mail
steamer, which comes about every six weeks, throws the mail over-
board in a sealed can and the natives swim out and tow it to the
shore. The outgoing mail is carried out to the steamer by the swim-
mers, who hold it on poles above the water. Niuafoou Island, one of
the Toga Archipelago, is the last independent kingdom in the South
Seas, ruled over by Queen Salote Tabou and a parliament, foreign

affairs being looked after by the New Zealand Government under the
mandate.

Niuafoou is one of the world’s famous volcanoes. It is a crater
island 44 by 5 miles in size, inclosing a circular lalze about 2 miles in
diameter. The narrow circular ridge of land around the lake is 200 to
800 feet high, forming steep cliffs facing the lake. The lake has three
small wooded islands in it, one of which contains two smaller crater
lakes. The island is the peak of a volcano rising 6,500 feet from the
ocean floor, which in that vicinity 1s formed by a flat shoulder of the
Australian continent about 6,000 feet below the surface. Upon this
the volcano rises as an immense cone 25 miles in diameter at the base.

direct view camera, the 65-foot reflecting camera, and the Einstein double
camera on the right. (Photograph by Kellers. )

The known eruptions occurred in 1853, 1886, 1912, and 1929. All
started with the splitting of the mountain across its flank except that
of 1886, which was in the old crater lake, explosive in type, and mostly
of ash, forming sand hills and lagoons. These ash hills are being
gradually covered with a dense growth of ironwood trees, the only
trees that appear to grow and thrive in the volcanic ash of the island.

The 1929 eruption was on the western side of the island, the fis-
sure system bursting open at 3 a. m., July 25, 1929, near the south-
west corner of the island, and line northward in a series of
fissures until it nearly reached the shore at the northwest. The cracks
were more than 33 miles long, requiring several hours in opening the
full length of the line of fracture. This delay gave the natives of the
village of Futu time to escape to the ridge. The sick and the aged were

bundled up and many fled naked, a drizzling rain adding to their
misery. Over all hung the pall of smoke from the oncoming fire at
the south, the trade winds bringing the menacing odor of deadly sul-
phurous fumes. The Futu-ites got across the northern crack before
it opened, but when it did open, what a flood of fiery lava poured
down on the ill-fated village! Two-thirds of the village was com-
pletely wiped out by the lava, and at least ten lava flows reached the
sea along a three-mile front. The chasms are 30 feet across where the
lava came in greatest volume. Cocoanut trees by thousands were
molded in lava casing, some of which were measured and found to be
13 feet high. They stand now in groves of rocky sentinels, the largest
field of tree molds anywhere in the world. The eruption lasted until
10 a.m. on that day, and many of the fissures are still smoking and
giving off sulphurous fumes. Fortunately, no lives were lost, and the
natives of Futu have now settled near the village of Angaha.

As soon as we were settled in camp intensive collecting began.
Using the lure of candy, chewing gum, and bead necklaces, I soon had
all of the children and many of the grown folks of the island working
for me as collectors, and numerous specimens of crustacea, shells,
lizards, and insects were brought in that I could not otherwise have
obtained in the eight weeks allowed for collecting. Owing to the
rough and rugged coast line, only three outrigger canoes were used
about the island, and consequently the natives do very little fishing.
The large seine I had with me was a curiosity to them, and as no
beaches suitable for hauling it were found, it could not be used.

When the native does go fishing he uses a large pole called Vaca-
IKauhaga, which has two small pieces of wood lashed to the sides at
the end, on which the catch of fish is strung. The native dives into the
ocean with the pole, swims out for some distance and rests on the
pole, fishing with a hand line often for hours at a time. The natives
are good swimmers and divers; one boy was adept in diving and pick-
ing starfish off the rocks in water four and five fathoms deep. Each
time he emerged with a number of specimens he was rewarded with a
corncob pipe and tobacco, which meant as much to him as the star-
fish did to me.

Dragonflies were very numerous, and many were collected. Only
one kind of butterfly—a world-wide species, Anosia plexippus
seen, and several were collected. All the birds, 20 in number, noted

Megapodius pritchardi, and is among the smallest of the genus but lays
a very large egg. The average measurements of the bird are: length
304 mm., circumference 228 mm., and spread of wings 609 mm. The
average measurements of the light buff-colored egg are: long diameter
70 mm., short diameter 45 mm. The bird lays its egg in the ash hills
of the 1886 eruption on the western side of the lake shore. It then
buries the egg I to 2 meters deep in the ash and fills up the hole all the
way to the surface. The temperature of the ash at the spot where the
egg is laid is 98.1° F.; this heat is not connected with the heat of the
volcano, but is rather a Dutch-oven effect. When the chick is hatched
it scratches its way out of the ash and is ready to begin life’s battles.
I could not find any evidence of the male bird tending the young
chicks, as is usual with this genus in Australia and the Philippines.

The most important product of the soil is the cocoanut. The island
is a veritable paradise for cocoanut palms, for they have never been
attacked by the rhinoceros beetle, Oryctes rhinosccrae, the scourge of
the South Sea Islands. It is one of the few islands in the Pacific free
of that pest, probably because of its isolated position and consequent
lack of communication with other islands. The trees here grow very
tall, the roots forming a dense network extending out in all directions
for many feet, enabling them to withstand the intense trade winds.
This tree gives the natives shelter and food; it also furnishes a wel-
come substitute for drinking water, as there is no fresh water on the
island except the rain water that is caught in small tanks, which is
quickly used up in the dry season. The water of the green cocoanuts
is therefore the natives’ only beverage, and on the warmest days it is
found to be cool and a very refreshing and wholesome drink. The
extensive use of cocoanuts for domestic purposes by the natives does
not seem to decrease the crop to any extent, for copra (the meat of
the ripe cocoanut) 1s the one and only export from the island.

There 1s evidence that the western side of the island is rising. The
western shore of the lake shows an uplift and the lava is covered with
lime deposits in the shape of large blisters, probably formed by blue-
green algae. Under these blisters were found numerous small crabs
of the genus A/etasesarma. Vow-net hauls were made from time to
time in the lake with good results, one of the interesting specimens
thus collected being a small shrimp of the genus Caridina, but no fish
were found in the lake The water is no doubt accumulated rain water,
and its alkalinity is due to the volcanic gases bubbling up from below.
Five small sulphur lakes are located on the southern end of the island
near the crater lake, one a bubbling lake giving off sulphuretted hydro-
gen gas, the temperature of which was 98° F. Samples of water from
all the lakes and craters were collected and brought back for analysis.

The natives are true Polynesians, light reddish-brown in color, well
formed, erect in bearing, and handsome in features. The women in
early womanhood have beautiful figures, but like all native women
of the tropics, they soon lose them as they grow older. Their eyes are
dark, with an expression of gentleness. They do not like to work, their
wants are few, and little clothing is worn, although foreign clothing
adapted to the climate is being worn more and more by both the men
and the women. The men consider it undignified to appear without a
shirt or coat, and always wear them on ceremonial occasions.

The natives are expert weavers of rough baskets, taking from three
to five minutes according to size to weave a basket out of the frond
of a cocoanut palm. They are also adept in making fire by the primi-
tive method of rubbing two sticks of wood together, 30 seconds being
the time required to perform the feat.

The natives were friendly, hospitable, and curious ; they were in and
around the camp at all hours of the day or night, except when attend-
ing one of the missionary churches, where they sang interminable
hymns with much gusto, but very pleasing harmony. They were at all
times quiet, dignified, and extremely interested in all the eclipse activi-
ties, and they had offered many prayers for our success. A few of
the ‘‘ Doubting Thomases ” wagered a pig against a shirt with the son
of one of the traders that nothing would happen and that the sun
would not be darkened, so that the young lad now owns more than his
share of pork, which, next to roast dog, is their favorite food. Among
other good qualities, these natives are absolutely honest and extremely
virtuous.

Towards the end of our stay on the island they brought in presents
of many fine grass mats—Falas—and Tapa cloths. Finally on the
morning of our departure, at least half of the population of the island
including the High Chief Fotofili, his son-in-law and future successor,
and the Magistrate, with their families, were down to bid us farewell.
They all expressed genuine regret and many sincere Tofas (goodbyes )
at our departure, and were particular to inform us through the trader
interpreter how much they had enjoyed having our party honor Niua-
foou with such a noteworthy visit.

The collections which have been forwarded to the National Museum
as its share of the results of this expedition include 100 bird skins and
over 7,000 alcoholic specimens of various kinds, as well as numerous
geologic specimens, stalactites of lava, lava tree molds, and water sam-
ples from the alkaline and sulphur lakes on the island.
EXPLORATIONS, OFTHE REV. DAVID 'C.:.GRAHAM
IND SZECHUAN, CHINA

By HERBERT FRIEDMANN,
Curator, Division of Birds, U. S. National Museum

The Rev. David C. Graham has continued his missionary work in
the province of Szechuan, western China, during the past year, and
as usual has utilized his spare time in collecting for the Smithsonian
Institution. Although no outstanding trip was made during the year,
much material of value was gathered at or near Graham’s station
at Suifu, all of which supplements previous collections from that area.
During the year something over 62,000 specimens were received by
the National Museum. Dr. Graham has also made plans and already
taken care of the advance details for two trips of importance which
he hopes to be able to realize next year—one to eastern Tibet, and
the other to Tatsienlu.

Just as last year the excessive rains made the journey to Moupin
unusually arduous, so in the beginning of this year a prolonged gen-
eral drought made collecting rather disappointing for a while at Suifu,
and it was not until later in the year that rains began to fall and condi-
tions were much improved. The drought caused a general scarcity of
insects and other forms, and this scarcity considerably increased the
effort involved in making collections.

As in previous years, the hordes of bandits and robbers have been
the greatest obstacles to travel and collecting. Thus, Graham writes
in his diary on August 24, “. . . . we took a boat from Suifu to San
Kuang, crossed overland at San Kuang, and went sixty li up the San
Kuang River to Yo Keo. We could have gone farther, but there is
a place between Yo Keo and Sa Ho where robbers constantly
appeals seus) ;

That robbers are not the only source of annoyance is evidenced by
the following entry on September 4. “ When we were coming down
the high mountain towards Tsanglinshien, I noticed that there was
no one else on that road either going or coming. After reaching
this city I learned that both leopards and robbers are fierce at the
top of the high mountain between here and Tseo-Jia-Geo. Leopards
were fiercer and more common over a wide territory than they have
been known to be before, and probably hundreds are killed every year

country around Tsanglinshien is described by Graham as a beautiful
district with high mountains, perpendicular limestone cliffs, and great
forests. Coal, iron, and sulphur occur plentifully and all are being

lecting in out-of-the-way places that probably would not occur to

the most trying experiences to a foreigner in West China, when travel-
ling, comes from the fact that a foreigner expects and loves privacy
when sleeping, studying, and working. It is nearly impossible to get
privacy in Chinese homes (as a guest) and in Chinese inns, The
Chinese have little conception of it. You try to work in a Chinese inn,
and the first thing you know the room is packed, and crowds are peek-
ing through the cracks and looking through the windows.”

The great bulk of the collections sent in this year is made up of fine

of this year’s explorations and collections are undoubtedly in the field
of entomology. Other groups, both of vertebrate and of invertebrate
animals, are also represented, as well as a number of interesting and

ANGIE ND REECATIVIES OF LIVING WHALES

By REMINGTON KELLOGG
Assistant Curator, Division of Mammals, U. S. National Museum

Nearly one hundred years have elapsed since the attention of the
readers of the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society was
directed to the finding of an extinct relative of living whales in a
marl bank within the present boundaries of the State of Louisiana.
In the ensuing years numerous dissertations have been written in
regard to this animal and yet many details of its bodily construction
remained unknown. Notwithstanding the rather wide distribution of
deposits in which such fossil remains occur, there still exists a sur-
prising scarcity of material suitable for critical study of the peculiari-
ties of this animal. In connection with a general interpretation of the
geological history of the cetaceans, an effort has been made to augment
available evidence by further field work in areas that gave some prom-
ise of increasing our knowledge of these animals. Accordingly plans
were made for a visit to one of these fossil bearing deposits and
on October 2, 1929, the writer and Mr. Norman H. Boss left Wash-
ington for Alabama under the joint auspices of the Carnegie Institu-
tion of Washington and the Smithsonian Institution.

The Jackson formation of the Gulf Coastal Plain, which consists of
calcareous fossiliferous sands and clays of marine origin, outcrops in
eastern Texas in the region between Trinity and Sabine Rivers, and
also extends eastward across central Louisiana, Mississippi, and Ala-
bama. This formation extends up the Mississippi embayment to near
Forrest City in St. Francis County, Arkansas. In northern Louisiana
the Jackson formation is concealed over a large area by swamp de-
posits, but crops out in southern Caldwell Parish. It was in this
parish that Judge H. Bree in 1832 found a partial skeleton of an at
that time unknown colossal animal. Some 28 vertebrae were exposed
by the slump of a hill near the Ouachita River after long continued
rains. One of these vertebrae was sent to Dr. Richard Harlan at
Philadelphia who hastened to publish an account of the discovery. On
account of its supposed reptilian affinities, Harlan proposed to call this
animal the king of lizards, Basilosaurus. The supposed affinities of
Basilosaurus immediately aroused a world wide controversy. It was
not until January, 1839, when Dr. Harlan arrived in London, England,
with additional fossil remains which had been found on the plantation

of Judge J. G. Creagh in Clark County, Alabama, in 1834 that the
precise relationships of Basilosaurus were recognized. Included among
the fossil bones that Dr. Harlan brought with him were teeth which
Professor Richard Owen was permitted to section and study. On the
basis of a microscopic examination of these teeth, Professor Owen was
enabled to demonstrate conclusively the mammalian nature of the
animal. Consequently, Owen proposed to substitute for Basilosaurus
the name Zeuglodon cetoides, in allusion to the yoke-like appearance
of the cheek teeth.

The next important discovery was made on the plantation of Judge
Creagh in Clark County, Alabama, in 1842 by Mr. S. B. Buckley, who
excavated a skeleton of Basilosaurus that consisted of portions of the
head and of the fore limbs, and a vertebral column extending to a
length of 65 feet. These remains were shipped to the office of the
Geological Survey of New York at Albany where they were studied
and described by Ibenezer Emmons. The subsequent history of this
particular specimen is somewhat interesting in that some time later
it passed into the possession of the Warren Museum at Boston. In
time the Warren Museum passed out of existence and some years
past this skeleton along with other vertebrate fossils was purchased
by the American Museum of Natural History in New York City.

The interest aroused by these discoveries induced Dr. Albert Koch,
a German collector, to visit Alabama. Koch arrived at Claiborne, Ala-
bama, in January, 1845, and after a brief reconnaissance in that vicin-
ity moved his headquarters three weeks later to Clarksville. He was
not entirely successful there, although portions of a zeuglodont were
found nearby. While at Clarksville, however, Koch received the news
that remains of this animal were rather plentiful near the Old Court
House in Washington County. Arriving at the Old Court House on
March 16, 1845, Koch immediately commenced excavating a skeleton
that was found in the same neighborhood. Several wagon loads of
bones were assembled at Washington Old Court House, from which
Koch reconstructed an animal measuring 114 feet in length, but com-
posed of five or more individuals. This composite skeleton of Basilo-
saurus was exhibited for some weeks as a sea serpent in the Apollo
Rooms on Broadway in New York City.

Later on this skeleton was shipped to Germany and exhibited in the
principal cities of Europe. The King of Prussia having purchased
this skeleton for the Anatomical Museum in Berlin, Dr. Koch with
the proceeds of the sale was enabled to visit Alabama again in 1848
and to resume his search for zeuglodont remains. A second skeleton
was assembled in the vicinity of Washington Old Court House and
86 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

shipped to Dresden where the work of preparation for exhibition was
begun. This zeuglodont was exhibited for some weeks at Vienna,
Austria, and later, although the exact details are unknown, it was
sold to the Chicago Academy of Sciences where it remained until
destroyed during the Chicago fire of 1875.

These discoveries and current stories in regard to the unusual abun-
dance of remains of zeuglodonts in the Gulf states led the United
States National Museum in 1894 to consider field work 1n this region.
Accordingly Professor Charles Schuchert was detailed to investigate
these occurrences and to collect if possible a specimen for the exhib1-
tion series. On arrival at Cocoa, Choctaw County, Alabama, on
November 2, 1894, Schuchert began his search and within a short
time successfully excavated the head of one individual and twenty-
four consecutive vertebrae of another, beginning with the atlas and
ending with the third lumbar vertebra, in addition to the ribs and the
major elements of the fore limbs. This material formed the basis
for the restoration of the asilosaurus skeleton exhibited at the At-
lanta Exposition in 1895. Inasmuch as the assembled skeleton was
incomplete, Schuchert again returned to Alabama and in November,
1896, found near Fail in Choctaw County the tail portion of another
zeuglodont which consisted of thirty-five consecutive vertebrae count-
ing from the penultimate one forward, as well as the pelvis and one
vestigial thigh bone (femur). This material was prepared for exhibi-
tion in the laboratory of the United States National Museum and
for some years this mounted skeleton has been on exhibition in the
hall of fossil animals.

After a rather hasty trip through Clark County, Alabama, Mr.
30ss and [| arrived at Silas, where we began our paleontological ex-
ploration of the Jackson exposures in Choctaw and the adjoining
Washington County. Inasmuch as we were unsuccessful in our search
for well preserved specimens of zeuglodonts in this area, we departed
for Melvin, also in Choctaw County. In that vicinity and under the
guidance of Mr. Robert Land, we were shown the places where
Schuchert had excavated the major portion of the material now in
the United States National Museum.

Associated with the gigantic Basilosaurus cetoides, which attained
a length of from 50 to 70 feet and whose skull measured approxi-
mately 5 feet from extremity of snout to back of braincase, was the
little short bodied Zygorhiza kochii, which may have had a maximum
length of from 12 to 15 feet. In the vicinity of Melvin and across
the line in Clarke County, Mississippi, we were fortunate enough to

locate an exceptionally well preserved skull and both lower jaws of one
individual, and other portions of the skeleton of five additional indi-
viduals of the little zeuglodont, Zygorhiza, which was our chief objec-
tive on this trip. In many places remains of this little zeuglodont
are almost as numerous as its larger relative. Among the contem-
porary inhabitants of the same coastal seas were a large aquatic snake
and a large tortoise-like turtle. Fish vertebrae measuring two or more
inches in diameter, teeth of sharks, and the curiously ridged rod-like
beaks of an extinct sword fish (Cylindracanthus ornatus) are fre-
quently noticed in the washes. An abundance of rounded shells of
small sea-urchins (Schizaster armiger and Macropneustes mortont),
a small scallop (Pecten perplanus), a little oyster (Ostrea falco),
with a thin shell fancied to resemble a hawk, and a large nautilus
(Aturia alabamensis), the chambers of which are locally known as
‘ goat’s heads,” occur in the “ Zeuglodon ”’ horizon.

The yellowish or gray marl, in which these zeuglodonts occur, 1s
often hardened around the bones. From two to four hard ledges, a few
inches in thickness and separated by layers of this marl, are also gen-
erally present in the “ Zeuglodon”’ horizon. These ledges are quite
resistent to the effects of erosion. Bones found in such ledges are
generally difficult to extricate on account of the hardness of the matrix
and the rather soft consistency of the bones themselves.

The typical outcrop of the Jackson formation is located near Jack-
son, Mississippi, from which locality it takes its name. The exposures
of this formation in the prairie region of central Mississippi occupy
an irregular belt that ranges in width from about 6 miles near the Ala-
bama line in Clarke County to a maximum of more than 35 miles 1n
the region west of Jackson. The total thickness of the basal member,
consisting of quartz sand and glauconite, and the overlying clay mem-
ber is approximately 150 feet in eastern Clarke County. This forma-
tion increases in depth in a westerly direction and attains a thickness
of more than 600 feet in Yazoo County. Inasmuch as the “ Zeuglo-
don” horizon is relatively thin and is situated near the base of the
upper clay member, which attains a total thickness of 70 feet in
Clarke County, one usually has to locate deeply eroded prairies to be
successful in a search for this fossil-bearing horizon. Several skele-
tons of the gigantic Basilosaurus were located along the eastern border
of Clarke County, but erosion and cultivation of the land had de-
stroyed whatever value they may have originally possessed for
paleontological study. Portions of two skeletons of the diminutive
zeuglodont, Zygorhiza, were excavated in this area.

In central Alabama, the Jackson formation occupies the prairie
region 1n Choctaw, Clark, Monroe, and Conecuh counties, but the
exposures are often restricted to narrow belts by the overlapping of
more recent formations. Although most of the territory, which was
settled by the early pioneers, was at that time covered with coniferous
and deciduous woods, there were small treeless tracts here and there
which were called “ prairies.’ These open spaces were the first to be
farmed and upon them flourished fields of cotton, which were culti-
vated with the assistance of slaves. In time the natural fertility of
the soil was greatly depleted and many of these prairie fields were
allowed to revert to their natural condition. Others became impos-
sible to cultivate because in plowing the furrows were thrown in such
a way that the fields were subjected to severe erosion during long con-
tinued rains. [ach drainage path in time became a deep gully and
ultimately the field was so cut up that further cultivation was 1mpos-
sible. For years the destructive action of erosion has been allowed to
continue without any serious effort being made to check its ravages
until now many of these fields are criss-crossed in every direction by
deep gullies. In some places the * Zeuglodon ”’ horizon was so close
to the surface that the skeletons were thrown out by the plow. These
bones were gathered up by the negroes and dumped along the edges
of the fields where occasionally they may now be found partially
buried in the accumulated debris. Some twenty occurrences of remains
of the gigantic zeuglodont that had been destroyed either by the plow
or by erosion and weathering were observed in Choctaw County dur-
ing the period of our visit. It is in these so-called ‘* washed-out ”
prairie fields that one finds today numerous exposures of the “ Zeu-
glodon ” horizon. In such fields were found a number of more or less
complete skeletons of the small zeuglodont, Zygorhiza, and various
portions of the skeleton of the gigantic Basilosaurus. In one instance
various fragments of a skeleton of Zygorhiza were found scattered
along an abandoned logging road. This skeleton has been exposed by
the iron-rimmed wheels of lumber trucks and subsequently destroyed
by the same agency. At another place a skeleton of another individual
lay in a cow-path where it had been trampled on for many years
by the feet of innumerable cattle.
POUR TER EXPLORATIONS FOR MOLLUSKS IN
(ele, MVS ONDINE

By PAU BART SGEH:
Curator, Division of Mollusks, U. S. National Museum

The granting of the Walter Rathbone Bacon Travelling Scholarship
to me for the third year made it possible to explore some of the West
Indian territory much in need of investigation. Two years ago this
same scholarship made it possible to subject all the provinces of
Cuba, except Oriente, to a close scrutiny for land mollusks. The three
and one-half months spent in this island, which supports a greater
land shell fauna than any other equivalent area in the world, yielded
an enormous amount of material. The same grant made it possible
to spend the summer of last year in an exploration of Porto Rico
and the Lesser Antilles lying between this and the island of Trini-
dad, as well as the islands of Margarita, Orchilla and the Dutch West
Indies lying off the coast of Venezuela. This year our efforts were
focused on the southern Bahamas, the islands off the south coast of
Cuba, and the Caymans.

After a futile attempt to obtain a suitable vessel in northern waters
to take the expedition to the Bahamas, contracts were finally closed in
Mianu, Florida, for the use of the Jsland Home, a boat that seemed
to meet our needs. The reason for again securing a vessel for this
cruise was the fact that commercial transportation in the area to be
visited was non-existent, for most of the territory to be explored con-
sists of islands rarely visited by man. For this reason also, it became
necessary to provide food for the trip at the outset. The large territory
to be covered—some 2500 miles—made it desirable to secure sufficient
assistants to reduce to a minimum the time spent upon each of the
many islands visited. For this reason I tendered an invitation to Mr.
Harold Chittick, one of my students at the George Washington Uni-
versity, and to two Washington Boy Scouts, Ray Greenfield, who ac-
companied me to Cuba two years ago, and Alva G. Nye, Jr.; also to
Mr. Harold S. Peters of the Bureau of Entomology of the United
States Department of Agriculture. To this staff were added the Cap-
tain of the [sland Home, E. Roberts, and the engineer, B. E. Lowe.

The Island Home was a 33-ton vessel, flat bottomed. 59 feet in
length, with a 21 foot beam, and a draft of 44 feet, and provided with

a 60 H. P. engine. Leaving Miami June 9, we reached Key West after
a two-day interval in which engine trouble developed, which, combined
with fueling, delayed our sailing for the Bahamas until June 16. Here
should be mentioned the kind assistance rendered our expedition by the
United States Navy Department. Not only were we permitted to
draw fuel and other supplies needed, but the engine shop made the
necessary repairs to our engine and rendered every possible assistance
to have us adequately equipped for the cruise.

Leaving Key West June 16, we headed for the Cay Sal Bank, an
irregular, pear-shaped submarine flat, a little more than 60 miles in
length in a southeasterly and northwesterly direction. This bank is
covered by a shallow sea, ranging from 34 to 15 fathoms, and fringed
by a chain of cays on all but the southern side. The bank, while only
some 20 miles from the central portion of the north coast of Cuba, is,
nevertheless, separated from that island by very deep water—the
Nicholas Channel—ranging from 212 to 534 fathoms. This great
depth does not bespeak land connections with Cuba. From Florida it
is separated by some 50 miles of equally deep water, and since the
whole bank slopes abruptly on all sides to great depth, the land mol-
luscan fauna was looked for with considerable interest.

Each of the cays, beginning with Cay Sal on the southwestern edge
of the bank and ending with Anguilla Cay, was explored, and the many
interesting things thus obtained are now resting in the Museum, await-
ing analysis. How little visited some of these cays are may be in-
ferred from the fact that on one of the Damas Cays we found an ele-
vated stake and curled about its base the white bleached bones of a
man who had evidently been shipwrecked here and perished.

On June 24 we left the Cay Sal Bank and crossed the deep Santaren
Channel to the Great Bahama Bank. The 25th and half of the 26th
were spent sailing some 180 miles over an almost calm shallow sea,
out of sight of land but with the glaringly white calcareous sand of
the bottom constantly in view. Like the northern Bahama Bank, this
reach appears almost devoid of life

at least visible life. We came
to anchor at about 11 a. m. in the snug little harbor formed by islets,
collectively known as Jamaica Cays.

From this date until the evening of July 3 we explored the cays
which stretch in an open looped chain southeastward to Great Ragged
Island. These islands, which mark the western limit of another deep,
are all composed of elevated reef rock less than 100 feet in height,
and vary in size from mere rock points to miles in extent. They are
94 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

very rugged and may be barren or covered in spots with a growth of
Sesuvium or Portulaca or a dense, almost impenetrable, thicket of
Platopuntia or other cacti.

Some of the larger cays, on the other hand, bear tangles of brush,
or even what might be called trees, all of the vegetation, however,
being of the drought-resistant type, save here and there where tangles
of mangrove jut into shallow bays. On these cays the most conspicu-
ous elements were the land mollusks of the genus Cerion, of which we
gathered thousands, though these were by no means the only land mol-
lusks of the region as evidenced by the collection now resting in the
National Museum.

Early on July 4 we left our anchorage in the Great Ragged Island
harbor and headed for Cay Verde. All along our course we had met
with many breeding colonies of sea birds, but Cay Verde is the only
cay boasting a breeding colony of Man-o’-War birds in the Bahamas.
Dull skies, squalls and heavy seas constantly breaking over our decks,
somewhat modified our looked-for celebration of the day. Our ship
soon had the putty, which had been used to close the seams of the ves-
sel in place of oakum, pounded out by the waves, and a call to man the
pump was in order. To make a short story of the longest day of our
cruise, I will say, simply, that the ship slipped entirely off the Colum-
bus Bank upon which Cay Verde is located, and we failed to sight
Cay Verde, but were greeted about 2 o’clock the next morning by
the welcome faint flashes of Castle Island lighthouse.

The next two days were spent in an attempt to repair our ship, which
was only in part successful, since we were unable to careen her on
account of her flat bottom. From this time until August II we were
forced to pump one hour out of every three, day and night, to keep the
ship habitable, and even then the leaky decks soaked most of our
belongings stored below.

July 5 to 15 we spent exploring the Crooked Island group, a tri-
angular bank about 45 miles in a north and south direction, and 35
miles east and west. This bank consists of Castle, Aklin, Crooked,
Fortune Islands, and the Fish Cays. Here again the sea drops imme-
diately off shore to a great depth, in places to almost 3,000 fathoms.

The group is isolated from all the adjacent groups of islands by
more than 1,000 fathoms. Some of its hills attain an elevation of 200
feet and habitats for our mollusks vary from bleak and barren sand
spits to mangrove tangles, and from dense grass flats and brush land
to small timber, as well as cultivated fields. The days spent here
again proved worth while and very profitable.

July 16 we sailed for the Plana Islands from Jamaica Bay, Aklin
Island, reaching our destination late in the afternoon. The evening
of this day and the next day were spent collecting on the westernmost
of the two cays. July 18 we attempted a landing on the eastern cay,
being particularly anxious to do so because this cay appears to be the
only one in all the Bahamas upon which Hutias, the large West Indian
rodents are present, and we had been asked especially to secure a series
of these for the National Museum. High seas and a very effective bar-
rier reef frustrated all our attempts at landing, and as there are no
residents on the Plana Islands who might have guided us through
some narrow passage in the reef, we were compelled, very reluctantly,
to forego an exploration of this island. The Plana Islands are also
bounded by deep water.

We next headed for Mariguana Island, a large cay some 25 miles
in length and 8 in its largest diameter, with a shallow flat at the eastern
extremity. This cay rises to an elevation of 80 feet at Abraham’s Hill,
and presents all the varied habitats listed for the Crooked Island group.
Here again we have deep sea on all sides immediately off shore.
Mariguana and Booby Cay on its southern flat yielded many interest-
ing mollusks, as well as a fine collection of birds, bats, and reptiles.

At the crack of dawn July 22 we headed for the Caicos Bank, cross-
ing the long stretch of the Caicos Island passage with some apprehen-
sion, but we reached Malcolm Bay without mishap. From then until
July 30 we explored the various cays bordering the Caicos Bank on
the north and east side between Blue Hills and Cockburn Harbor. The
Caicos Bank, like the other banks examined, rises abruptly from the
sea, practically forming an atoll. It is some 72 miles in a southeast
by northwestern direction, and about 58 miles in its widest east to
west diameter. Its highest hill is said to be 280 feet. The same diver-
sity of habitat mentioned for previous groups exists here, but in addi-
tion, at least one cay—Pine Cay—of the Fort George group, west of
North Caicos, boasts a fine stand of pine. The group as a whole yielded
a fine series of mollusks, as well as many other things.

July 30 we crossed the deep narrow channel known as Turk’s Island
passage, and from then until August 2 devoted our time to an explo-
ration of the cays situated upon the Turk’s Island Bank. The Turk’s
Island Bank is the easternmost bank of the Bahamas that has habitable
land projecting above the sea. Most of its cays proved rich in mol-
lusks. On the afternoon of the second of August we re-crossed the
Turk’s Island passage and explored the small cays at the southern

end of the southeast Caicos group. We then crossed the Caicos Bank
and devoted August 3 and 4 to an exploration of the cays off the
south coast of Providentiales and of West Caicos, all of which yielded
rich collections. August 5 we crossed the deep channel between west
Caicos and Little Inagua, and the remainder of this day and part of
the next were spent in a search for the mollusks which it harbors.

On the afternoon of August 6 we headed for Great Inagua Island,
which is by far the largest of the southern Bahamas. It has a length
of almost 45 miles in a southwest by a northwesterly direction, and a
north by south width of about 18 miles in its largest diameter. In
reality it is another atoll which has emerged from the sea. Its high-
est hill is said to be 132 feet. Its shores slope precipitously into the
great depths of the sea on all sides. This island, as its wonderful
molluscan fauna indicates, in reality represents a host of cays fused
by elevation. We explored not only the ocean rim in our boat, but
also the interior of the island, in a Ford truck. Inagua proved by far
the richest of all the Bahamas in diversity of molluscan fauna.

The barometer indicating fine weather, we put to sea at 4 p. m. on
August 10 from Matthewstown for our naval station at Guantanamo,
southeastern Cuba, a distance of some 120 miles. We selected a night
run for its calmer sea. Favorable winds enabled us to sight the Cape
Macy light in eastern Cuba a little after 10 o’clock, and we rounded
the Cape at 2:30 in the morning of the 11th of August, reaching
Guantanamo about 1:30 in the afternoon.

The Naval authorities, at my request, examined the [sland Home
and pronounced her unseaworthy and recommended her abandon-
ment until suitable repairs could be made. Since it was impossible to
obtain the necessary repairs for some weeks at the Station, other ves-
sels being on the ways, I informed the owners in Miami of the fact
and set about finding another suitable vessel in Cuban waters.

The José Enrique, a 35-ton sailing bark, equipped with a 22 H. P.
gasoline motor, carrying a complement of five men, was finally chart-
ered at Santiago, Cuba, and after fueling at the Naval base we set sail
for Santiago. On August 28 we again set sail westward, stopping at
convenient intervals along the south coast of Cuba and exploring the
many low keys in the embayment between Cabo Cruz and Bretton
Cay, the westernmost of that labyrinth of keys in that part of Cuba,
which we reached September 10. While these keys did not yield an
enormous catch, many of them proving entirely barren of land mol-
lusks, the specimens obtained nevertheless furnished information very
desirable to our studies.

On September 10 we headed southward for the Cayman Islands,
a group of three peaks whose molluscan fauna proclaims them a con-
tinuation of the Sierra Maestra range of southeastern Cuba, from
which they are separated by about 115 miles. About noon the follow-
ing day we reached Cayman Brac, which looks like a block of honey-
comb limestone elevated out of the sea to a height of about 130 feet.
It is 10} miles long and about 14 broad. The top of the block is rough
and covered with brush, and its sides are almost perpendicular. A
coastal plain strip on the north and west furnishes arable land and
good roads. We engaged an automobile and soon covered all parts
sufficiently to get a representative collection of its molluscan and other
faunas by the end of the next day.

On the evening of September 11 we sailed for Little Cayman some
4 miles west of Cayman Brac. Engine trouble caught us at sea after
dark. Approaching the northeastern end of Little Cayman we almost
came to grief on a fringing reef. The coolheadedness and good
seamanship of our captain, however, saved the day. Little Cayman,
to which we devoted September 11 to 13, is about 9 miles long and
1 mile wide. Its highest peak is said to be about 100 feet. As a whole,
it appears much lower than Cayman Brac and has less tillable land
than that island and only a very scant population. Most of the island
is covered with brush and timber. We found it splendid collecting
ground for mollusks and other things, and made a large catch.

On September 13, we left our anchorage in Blossom Village harbor
and proceeded west toward Grand Cayman, which is about 60 miles
distant. This is the largest of the three Caymans, having a length of
about 20 miles and a breadth of about 8 miles. Its highest point is
said to be only about 50 feet. Much of the island consists of sand
dunes. North Sound, a great bay on the northwestern end, is man-
erove-fringed.

At Georgetown, the capital of Grand Cayman, we were met by one
of my former students, Dr. Overton, the Chief Medical Officer of
the Cayman Island, and thanks to his assistance and the kind helpful-
ness of the Commissioner, we were enabled to explore the island
thoroughly and to secure a large amount of material in the short time
allotted to us. September 18, at 4a. m., we set sail for the Cuban coast,
and reached the shores of Sandy Cay at about 9 a. m., on the roth, after
sailing 145 miles. From this time until September 24 we cruised
along and collected on the keys between Cayo Largo and the Isle
of (Pines.
SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1930 IOT

At dusk on the 24th we tied up against the dock of the Customs
House at Nueva Gerona, Isle of Pines, where we were graciously
and helpfully received by the Government officials. By the use of an
automobile we were able to visit all the desirable parts of the island,
securing a magnificent catch of much needed material.

On September 27 we headed for our final port, Batabano, which we
reached on the morning of the 29th with all things packed ready for
transmission to Havana. The Port officials here, as elsewhere, had
been apprised of our coming, which made it possible to have all things
aboard a freight car within two hours after docking. A motor bus
carried our party to Havana where we were met by Cuba’s grand old
naturalist, Dr. Carlos de la Torre, who helped me with all my needs
and gave to the rest of my staff a real glimpse of Havana.

All things settled, we left Havana September 1 with 4 young, live
tortoise-shell turtles purchased at Cayman Brac, 2 huge live iguanas
captured on Cayo Rosario, and 120 huge hermit crabs caught on one
of the Doce Leguas Cays as our chief baggage. These live animals
were intended for the Zoological Park at Washington. In this connec-
tion it might also be mentioned that I shipped by parcel-post from
Guantanamo to the same institution 22 live iguanas which we had
caught on various cays in the Bahamas. All of these animals arrived
in good condition. Our main collection was shipped by freight, in
part from Fortune Island, in part from: Guantanamo, and the rest
from Cuba. We returned to Washington on October 3.

This cruise has yielded a larger amount of molluscan material than
any other in which I have had a part, excepting the U. S. Bureau
of Fisheries expedition in the Philippines in 1907-1910. We obtained
some 250,000 specimens of mollusks, and in addition 925 bird skins
and 596 reptiles and batrachians ; likewise some mammals, fish, insects,
and marine invertebrates.

Great credit for the securing of these splendid collections is due to
my energetic associates mentioned at the beginning of this article. The
Cuban crew of the José Enrique also deserves special mention, from
the captain to the cabin boy. Foremost of all, however, thanks are
due to our Department of State for having secured not only free
entry to all foreign ports for our expedition, but also that good will
and helpfulness on the part of all officials in the places visited that
makes an expedition of this kind a real joy. It would take more space
than all these notes to adequately express thanks for all the favors
102 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

received. To the officers of our Navy at Key West and Guantanamo
great credit is due not only for the assistance rendered in equipping
both vessels, but the kindly way in which hospitalities were extended
to us, which will always leave a pleasant memory of the occasion,
RAVING HOR, CRUSTACEANS Ad PORTUGAS,
FLORIDA

By WALDO Ly SCHMITT,

Curator of Marine Invertebrates, U. S. National Museum

The richness of the crustacean fauna at Tortugas, Florida, and its
importance in relation to the food habits and movements of certain
fishes, led me to continue investigations at the Carnegie Marine Bio-
logical Station from July 9 to August 8, 1930, through the kindness of
the Carnegie Institution of Washington. It is planned as a point of
departure for further studies on the crustacea to complete a survey
of their kinds and distribution. Judging from the results already
obtained, it is anticipated that at least 200 species will be found to occur
at Tortugas and vicinity.

This year was the first in which a preliminary investigation of the
deeper waters readily accessible to the laboratory was undertaken. In
the course of some 20 hauls made with the 30-foot otter trawl, two
hauls between 180 and 237 fathoms brought to light 16 species of
“deep sea’’ crustacea. Most noteworthy among these were eight
specimens of that giant among isopods, Bathynomus, and a new
Portunid crab of the genus Benthocascon, heretofore known only from
a single specimen taken between 185 and 440 fathoms in the Andaman
Sea.

Three specimens of Bathynomus were obtained from the first haul
in 180 to 220 fathoms, and five specimens in the second haul in 220
to 237 fathoms. The largest specimen measures 10$ inches long by 44
inches broad. In length it is only an eighth of an inch shorter than the
record specimen taken at a depth between 225 and 594 fathoms off
the northeast coast of Ceylon. The species is comparatively rare in col-
lections. Between 1890 and 1906 nine specimens were taken by the
Royal Indian Marine Survey Ship /nvestigator in Indian Seas in the
course of six hauls in from 195 to 740 fathoms, while seventeen speci-
mens have been secured by various American vessels. The first speci-
men known to science was taken by the Blake in 1878 from 955
fathoms in the Caribbean Sea; two specimens were secured by the
Albatross in 1885 and 1888 in the Gulf of Mexico and the Bahamas
in 730 and 1,186 fathoms respectively; six specimens were taken by
the Bingham Oceanographic Expedition of 1925 off the coast of Brit-
ish Honduras north of Glover Reef in 366 fathoms and, finally, the

eight specimens recorded above were taken by the Yacht Anton Dohrn
of the Carnegie Institution on July 31, 1930.

Many species of corals flourish in these semitropical waters, and as
a result dredging is carried on with considerable hazard to one’s gear,
nets on occasion becoming hopelessly torn or caught on the huge coral
heads. On one occasion our steel cable parted in ten fathoms of water,
and the only large net seemed irrevocably lost. The swift run of
tidal currents so stirs up the sediment in these otherwise unusually
clear waters that the bottom can be seen only with difficulty. The buoy
which marked the net was carried away in rough weather a day or
two after its loss, but a week later, just at slack water when the sedi-
ment disturbance was practically at a standstill, Captain Mills of the
Laboratory’s yacht with rare good fortune saw the mud-covered
meshes of the net on the bottom with the aid of a water glass. It was
caught by several grapnels but could not be raised, and Captain Mills
with the aid of only a metal diving hood descended in the 60 feet of
water to affix a line to a strategic point of the net. He found that the
net had at the time of towing brought up under a coral head not less
than 12 feet high and thick and solid in proportion. Even a steel cable
had to give way before such a mass of coral. It was with this net,
after its recovery, that the most notable of the dredge hauls ever made
by the Anton Dohrn were accomplished.

I returned to Washington by way of Tampa and Tarpon Springs
for the purpose of visiting this headquarters of the Gulf sponge fish-
ery. It is conducted almost entirely by Greek spongers, who, with
their families, form a considerable percentage of the population of
Tarpon Springs. On the way to Tortugas, I called upon Mr. Robert
Ranson of St. Augustine, Florida, and upon Will Wallis at Braden-
ton, both of whom have contributed a number of interesting speci-
mens to the invertebrate collections of the Museum from time to time.
Iam very grateful to them for the many courtesies shown me in their
respective cities, and to the Carnegie Institution for the opportunity
afforded for studying the Decapod Crustacea of the Tortugas region.
COVER CHING REIS IN THE WESt

By J. M. ALDRICH,
Associate Curator, Division of Insects, U. S. National Museum

Continuing work which has now extended over a period of 40 years,
I spent part of June and July, 1930, in making collections of flies in
Idaho, Washington, California, and Colorado.

The vicinity of Lewiston, Idaho, offers a great variety of climate,
the city being situated in a deep valley only about 800 feet in altitude
while nearby are foothills and mountains rising to about 5,000 feet.
The low altitude has a warm climate, with sage-brush and other plants
characteristic of the plains region, as well as some which occur much
farther south. The higher altitudes are cooler, with more rainfall, and
above 3,000 feet are generally forested. Thus there is a wide range of
plant life, and a correspondingly great diversity in the insect inhabi-
tants. Having lived for 20 years at Moscow, Idaho, altitude 2,700 feet,
I have collected extensively over the region; but there were many flies
that I had found only once in the whole time, and undoubtedly others
yet undiscovered. In the recent visit I endeavored to collect in as
many places as possible in the time at my disposal, with especial
attention to those which previous experience had shown to be richest
in flies.

Across the Snake River west of Lewiston Hes the city of Clarkston,
Washington, at the same altitude. In this warm climate the collecting
is better early in the season, and only the late species were obtainable
in June. I visited the canyon of Asotin Creek, above the town of
Asotin, Washington, on several days, with fair results. Two visits
were made to Lake Waha, a small mountain lake 25 miles south of
Lewiston at 3,500 feet elevation, among coniferous forests, where
many interesting species of flies were found; this is one of the best
places in the region in June. Lapwai Creek ten miles south of Lapwai,
Idaho, at an elevation of about 1,500 feet, yielded some valuable infor-
mation about the distribution of species and also about their habits.
Juliaetta, Idaho, elevation 1,200 feet, in a deep, rocky valley with tim-
ber on the precipitous sides, was not so good as on some former visits,
the best time for collecting having passed. About 12 miles northeast
of Moscow, Idaho, is a small mountain range called Thatuna Hills on
government maps, in which the main peak is called Cedar Mountain,
but is locally known as Moscow Mountain. This is about 4,900 feet in

altitude, and a splendid place for collecting in June. I visited the
summit twice. It is becoming well known to students of the flies from
the considerable number of new species which have been described
from specimens captured there. Entomologists stationed at the Uni-
versity of Idaho (in Moscow) and those at the Washington State
College (in Pullman, Washington, only ten miles west of Moscow)
have done a great deal of collecting on Moscow Mountain, which
is the “type locality’ of the new species just mentioned. Some 20
years ago I collected a new species of flesh fly at the summit, described
afterward as Sarcophaga thatuna; curiously enough it has never been
found anywhere except at the extreme summit of this mountain, and
was common there on both my visits this year.

The vicinity of Spokane, Washington, is also a diversified, semi-
forested region lower in altitude than Moscow, but with many fine
streams and lakes, which improve the collecting, as flies are generally
fond of moist places. I collected at several places along streams in
the outskirts of Spokane, and twice ascended Mount Spokane, the
summit of which reaches an altitude of 5,808 feet. Little or no collect-
ing of flies has been done on this mountain hitherto. The species are
mostly the same as found on Mount Moscow, but there is a much
larger alpine area. There is a fine road to the summit, and I should
have spent more time there but for the fact that the mountain is 35
miles from Spokane. Moreover, I found the summit to be decidedly
colder than that of Moscow Mountain, so that bright sunshine was
necessary to make collecting of flies successful, as these insects are
very sensitive to cold and disappear when the sun clouds over, even on
warm afternoons. The total time that I was able to collect near the
summit was much reduced by cloudy intervals during the two days
I was there. There are a number of kinds of large, showy flies here,
which are very characteristic of alpine situations in western North
America, the same ones with some exceptions being found on many
different mountains over a wide area. It is always thrilling to the
entomologist to attain the altitude where they occur, even though
many of them are well represented in collections and are therefore not
especially desirable to collect.

Leaving the region in which many years of collecting had made me
rather familiar with the species, I devoted a week to collecting in the
vicinity of the town of Smith River, California, situated on the shore
of the Pacific Ocean at the mouth of the Smith River, about six miles
south of the Oregon state line. Being at sea level this locality might
be thought to compare with Lewiston, Idaho, in its insect population ;
but this is not at all the case, as the narrow coastal strip is notably cool

SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1930 IU4

in its summer climate, so that the vegetation and insect life are very
unlike those of the interior. They are in fact largely a continuation
southward of a flora and fauna which extend in some of its members
all the way to Alaska. A few species of flies of more southern coastal
distribution also come up this far. The forms characteristic of the
seashore, living in the larval stage on seaweeds, coastal species of
plants, or on other coastal species of animals, are by far the most
important and interesting of the flies which I collected here.

On seaweed-covered rocks washed by the ocean waves, I found the
two known species of the singular genus Paraclunio. It belongs to the
midge family, but is robust and strong. Its leathery wings are unaf-
fected by sea-water; coming out of the receding wave it runs with
fluttering wings over the wet rock until submerged again. One of the
species has a range extending to Alaska, the other one being more
local along the Oregon and California shores. The larvae live in the
seaweeds on the rocks, but I could not find any present at the time of
my visit.

Another remarkable fly that I found is Melanderia mandibulata,
previously known only from the Washington Coast immediately north
of the mouth of the Columbia River. In this fly, the mouth is de-
veloped into a pair of pincers for holding its prey—a_ structure
unknown in other Diptera, as the real mandibles or pincers, such as
occur in lower orders of insects, are reduced in other flies to small
blades or needles, or more often to rudiments hardly recognizable. In
Melanderia the organs are derived by modification of other mouth-
parts, and only imitate true mandibles. Professor Melander, for many
years connected with the Washington State College, is the only col-
lector who had previously found this species. One of his specimens
which I took to Europe last year and showed to many entomologists,
excited the liveliest interest there. I found this species on the wet
rocks above the ocean, where it finds its prey among the soft-bodied
organisms occurring there. By spending much time for several days
I obtained a large enough supply to enable me to present the species
as a gift from the National Museum to several of the principal
museums of the Old World, as well as those in North America; one
went to Australia. This species was the principal find of my trip.

Returning through Colorado, I stopped as I have done several times
at Tennessee Pass, on the divide of the Rocky Mountains at 10,290
feet altitude. Being on one of the main railroad lines, this is a very
convenient stopping-place. There is no hotel, but as before I was
indebted to Mr. L. E. Maupin, a pioneer who arrived at the Pass in

LIZ SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

1879, for accommodations and pleasant intercourse. The evenings by
his fireside were, as in previous years, a memorable part of my trip.
The coldness of the nights makes a fire always necessary; there was a
heavy frost on one of the nights. The climate in midsummer com-
pares with that of the far north, and the insects also are very similar

to those occurring at lower levels near the Arctic Circle. My visit
was at an earlier date in the summer than my former ones; conse-
quently I was able to get some species not before collected here.

While the total number of flies collected on my trip was not impres-
sive as such things go—about two thousand—the collection included
a larger number of interesting kinds than I have ever obtained before
in the United States in a single season.

Pp bOnANiCM Visit tO SOUTH AND HAST ABRICA:

Bye JN, Sy JaUM Clay COXON
Custodian, Section of Grasses, U. S. National Museum

In June, 1929, I started for London on my way to South Africa to
attend the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement
of Science. The sessions were held partly in Capetown (July 22-27)
and partly at Johannesburg (July 30-August 5). Leaving London
on the Llandovery Castle the latter part of June we arrived in Cape-
town July 19. The passengers included 160 scientists bound for the
meetings, and other boats brought their quota. We stopped a few
hours each at Teneriffe, Ascension, and St. Helena but did not land at
Ascension. Certainly good old St. Helena never saw such a swarming
of scientists over her hills and valleys as took place on that day.

Every effort was made by those in charge of arrangements in South
Africa to make the visitors comfortable. Excursions permitted an
examination of the local flora. Though it was winter many plants were
in bloom. A two-day excursion on a special train through the Karoo
allowed botanists to examine the curious xerophytic flora of this arid
region. A stop was made at Kimberley to inspect the diamond mines.
There the members saw the method of mining, the separating of the
diamonds from the pebbles and gravel by means of “ grease tables,”
and great piles of the diamonds themselves worth hundreds of thou-
sands of dollars.

After the conclusion of the meetings I joined an excursion to Vic-
toria Falls and other points in Southern Rhodesia. We lived on a
special train for 12 days, visiting points of interest to botanists, zoolo-
gists, geologists, and archeologists. At Bulawayo motor cars took our
party to a cave to inspect Bushmen drawings and to Motopos Hills
to see the grave of Cecil Rhodes, for whom Rhodesia was named. On
a high round-topped hill overlooking the country for many miles
around lies the grave surrounded by huge boulders.

The Victoria Falls of the Zambesi River are one of the wonders
of the world. The river flows through a great lava bed and the surface
of the surrounding country is the same above and below the falls. The

falls are 420 feet high and about a mile and a quarter wide, thus ex-
ceeding Niagara Falls by a considerable margin. But the view of
Niagara is much more impressive because the whole of the falls may
be seen at once and the volume of water is little obscured by spray.
The Victoria Falls can be seen in their entirety only from the air and,
especially at high water, the view is almost obliterated by the spray.

One other point of particular interest in the province, especially to
the archeologists, was the Zimbabwe Ruins, about 12 miles south of
Fort Victoria, the nearest railroad station. The ruins are in part well
preserved and indicate that an earlier race extracted gold here and
used the stone structures for defense.

The excursion ended at Beira in Portuguese East Africa, where
the party embarked for home. It was interesting to note that four
important food plants in South Africa came originally from America,
maize (called mealies in Africa), white potatoes, sweet potatoes, and
cassava. The last is a Brazilian plant whose fleshy starchy roots yield
the tapioca of our markets.

Some of the party went directly to London; others left the boat
at Mombasa and spent two weeks at Nairobi. In company with
Mr. Cotton, Keeper of the Herbarium at Kew, and a few others
I disembarked at Tanga in northern Tanganyika. On the way from
Beira we stopped a few hours at Dar-es-Salaam and Zanzibar.

Mr. Cotton and I first went to Amani where is located the Amani
Agricultural Institute. This was previously a scientific station in Ger-
man East Africa. There are here good laboratories and a herbarium.
We next went by rail to Moshi for the ascent of Mount Kilimanjaro
but found that the most favorable starting point was Marangu, a
village 10 miles to the northeast. From Marangu we had an easy
climb on mule back by a good trail, taking a cook and four porters.
The first night was spent at Bismark Hut, a resthouse near the upper
limit of the forest at about 8,000 feet. The second and third nights
were spent at Peters Hut, a resthouse in the alpine region at about
12,000 feet. On the third day I ascended to the limit of vegetation
at about 14,000 feet where there was a good view of Kibo, the western
rounded snow-capped peak of Kilimanjaro (17,910 feet). The alpine
grasses belong to such temperate genera as Festuca, Poa, Trisetum,
and Deschampsia. On the fourth day we descended to Marangu.

Our next stop was Nairobi which we reached by rail from Taveta
via Voi. Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, lies on a grassy plateau at an
altitude of 5,500 feet, inland from Mombasa 330 miles. This is the
point from which parties start on the big game hunts to the surround-
ing territory.

A two-day trip by motor car was made to the vicinity of Mount
Kenya (17,000 ft.), but there was not time for the ascent. Through
the courtesy of Government officials a trip through Uganda was ar-
ranged. The route was by rail to Kisumu, by steamer across Lake
Victoria (26,828 sq. mi.; altitude 3,700 ft.) to Entebbe, the adminis-
trative center for Uganda, by motor car to Kampala, the center of
agricultural and botanical research, by motor car to Jinja, the term1-
nus of the Uganda railroad, by rail back to Nairobi, with one-day
stops at Eldoret, Nakuru, and Naivasha in Kenya.

On September 28 I sailed from Mombasa for London via the Red
Sea. Although I left the boat at Marseilles, crossed France and made
close connections with a fast Atlantic liner, it took nearly a month to
reach New York.

The collecting (grasses only) in the Union of South Africa was
meager because I was there in the winter season (112 numbers col-
lected here). Through Southern Rhodesia the collecting was re-
stricted because it was the dry season, though at Victoria Falls the
spray from the falls gave moisture in the immediate vicinity (204
numbers in Southern Rhodesia, including 87 numbers at Victoria
Falls). At Beira on the coast the collecting was better (56 numbers).
The stops at Dar-es-Salaam and Zanzibar were short, but by going
immediately beyond the limits of the town one and one-half hours
were utilized for collecting at each place (Dar-es-Salaam 27 numbers,
Zanzibar 23 numbers). At Amani the collecting was good (63 num-
bers) and at Moshi also, except on the open ground where it was too
dry (41 numbers). On Kilimanjaro the grasses were of much inter-
est, especially in the alpine regions (89 numbers).

In Kenya and Uganda the collecting was good though it was the
dry season around Nairobi. At Eldoret and Nakuru the grasses were
abundant and in fine condition (the numbers were as follows: Nairobi
117, Kisumu 35, Entebbe 52, Kampala 22, Jinja 50, Eldoret 51, at
stations between Eldoret and Nakuru 35, Nakuru 42, Naivasha, in
a much-erazed region, 19, Mombasa in about one hour’s collecting
40). The numbers for each locality represent for the most part differ-
ent species.

So far as collecting was concerned my attention was given exclu-
sively to the grasses. But my interest, of course, extended to other
plants. The peculiar flora of the Cape region, so rich in Proteaceae,
was of interest to all the botanists present. The many succulent plants

of the Karoo reminded me of our own arid regions of the West. The
grotesque baobab tree with its great trunk all out of proportion to the
branches was photographed by everyone who had a camera.

Altogether the trip was noteworthy because of the opportunity to
meet the South African botanists, to renew acquaintance with the
British botanists, to gain first-hand information concerning the floristic
conditions of another continent, and to obtain a fine collection of
grasses for the National Herbarium.
ANTHROPOLOGICAL WORK ON THE KUSKOKWIM
RVR Ae Se

By ALES HRDLICKA,
Curator of Physical Anthropology, U. S. National Museum

The work of the summer of 1930 was devoted principally to the
Kuskokwim River, the second largest stream of Alaska and hitherto
unknown to physical anthropology. The Kuskokwim flows to the
south of the Yukon, from the McKinley range of mountains to the
Kuskokwim bay or bight; and like the Yukon it has been partly peo-
pled by the Indian and partly by the Eskimo. In the thirties of the last
century it was discovered and sparsely colonized by the Russians. It
has at present a fairly large native and a small white population, the
latter consisting almost exclusively of traders, Government employees,
and, in the upper parts of the river, miners. It can only be reached
by the costly airplane, or over a broad and at times difficult portage
from the Yukon, or twice a year by a freight steamer from Seattle.

The route chosen was that across the portage. The trip from Wash-
ington took a whole month, due partly to the delayed season. Head-
quarters were established at Bethel, and from there two trips were
made, one down the bay as far as Apogak, the other upstream as far
as Stony River. The rapidity and success of the work were due largely
to the long days, and to aid received through the U. S. Bureau of
Fisheries and the Government Bureau of Education.’

The natives themselves were all that could be desired. To make the
work on the living more intelligible and sympathetic to them, it was
combined with examination of the lungs and heart, which led to the
learning of collateral facts of decided value. And the pathological
factor was accentuated with much benefit also in making the skeletal

or

collections. The latter was carried on with the full knowledge of the
natives and often in their view and with their assistance. They were
told that I wanted only the old ‘* heathen ” remains, in which no living
person had any interest; that the bones were needed for studies and
for comparisons of the development, the type, and the diseases of the
old with those of the present people; and that they would be treated
with all possible consideration. The results both with the living and
with the skeletal remains were very gratifying. They comprise the
measurements of every fullblood male that could be found along the
lower 400 miles of the river and bay; observations on many of the
women, children, and mixedbloods; and collections filling over 50
boxes of precious old skeletal material. An unexpected but welcome
feature was the willingness of all the natives to be photographed, but
unfortunately the prevalent drizzles and cold weather of this year pre-
vented full success in this direction.

At Bethel, thanks especially to Mrs. Heron and Miss Martin, con-
tingents of Eskimo were obtained from a much larger territory than
could be visited. There were numerous individuals from the “ tundra ”’
(Johnson River) and some from as far as Nelson Island and Good-
news Bay. This gave valuable insight into conditions over a large and
hitherto unknown region.

More in detail, the results of the work were manifold. They may
briefly be enumerated as follows:

Population.—The native population of the Kuskokwim River is re-
stricted to the lower 350 miles of the stream with its affluents and to
its bay. It is estimated collectively at 3,000 individuals. It extends
up to the Stony River. In the 200 miles between the Stony and
McGrath there live now but three families of about 25 persons, a
large proportion of whom are young children, with very few if any
of the adults native to that region.

Race.—The entire region, up to near the Stony River and includ-
ing the Hoolitna River, is now and has apparently always been occu-
pied by the Eskimo. Only three Indians were encountered in this
region, all close to Stony River and all from elsewhere. The current
notion that the Eskimo reached to Sleitmute and the Indians began
above that was not borne out by the finds; the present extension of the
IXskimo certainly reaches to and includes the Hoolitna, and there
are no old sites between this and the Stony River which would show
a previous existence here of the Indian. The Indian territory if it
may be so called—for there are hardly any of them there—begins
close to the Stony River. But an occasional Indian type of face may
be noticed as far down as Napaimute and there are indications that

some Eskimo-Indian mixture has taken place in these reaches. The
Kuskokwim Indian below McGrath has practically vanished. The
strong probability is that he was never over this part of the river in
any larger groups or numbers and that the Kuskokwim was not an
old home of the Indian. From Napaimute down to the bight there
is no trace of anything Indian excepting a few individuals (one a
Cherokee, another a Cree) who came here accidentally and merged
with the Eskimo.

The Eskimo.—tThe Eskimo of the Kuskokwim and the neighboring
regions are of a remarkably homogeneous and interesting type. This
type is characterized by short to medium stature, meso- to subbrachy-
cephalic head, mostly a rather short and broad face, large malars, small
prominence of the not very narrow nose, mongoloid eyes, full, dusky
red cheeks in the children and young, black straight to broadly wavy
hair, light brown (tan to submedium brown) skin, full chest, and
often relatively short limbs.

From Akiachok and especially Napaimute up the river, this type
shows a somewhat higher stature and greater robustness. It is poor-
est in the tundra region and in the coast villages towards Nelson Island.
Those differences correspond directly to differences in environment
and food—the worse these are, the lower in general is the physique
and also the energy of the people.

In the upper half of the Eskimo territory on the Kuskokwim, there
are numerous traces of Russian admixture. This is generally easy to
recognize by a greater stature and robustness, by the physiognomy, by
lighter eye color, by nearly white color of the skin of the body (the
face may be much as in fullbloods), and by greater and more white-
man-like beard. In some of the native fullbloods of the lower river
and the tundra the face is quite hairy, but the beard is not so thick
and soft as in whites. A few mixedbloods were seen on the upper river
that looked like Mexicans, indicating some Mediterranean admixture.
In but one case was there an indication of negro blood; the Eskimo as
a whole have been more fortunate in this respect than some of our
Indians.

Skeletal remains—The skeletal remains along the Kuskokwim
occur in two forms. The old burials, from the pre-Russian to about
the mid-Russian times, were all above or on the ground, in boxes or
“ houses of the dead ”’ made of roughhewn thick slabs, joined in dove-
tailed manner without nails. The bodies in these boxes lay invariably
in the contracted position, on their side, and with the head in generally
the same direction in one burial place, though this was not always the
same as that in other burial grounds. The boxes were constructed

much as were those on the Yukon, and many were evidently decorated
by paint and even with animal and human figures. The body was
covered with caribou skin, or laid in with just what little it had on. In
some instances earth was placed about the corpse, but mostly there
was no earth in contact with the body. A clay dish (lamp) was
placed inverted in one corner, generally at the head but occasionally
at the feet, especially with the males; and there was nothing else of
value left or placed with the body. Above Bogus Creek, where the
lamps must have been scarce, even they were usually absent in the
burials.

Above the body in the box was a “ roof” of supports, in some in-
stances thick wooden slabs, and these were covered with birch bark;
or there was only a birch bark cover, taken generally from a canoe
and showing the sewing of the strips together. Then came 6 to 12
inches of earth; perhaps another birch bark layer and more earth;
and finally slabs or flat rafters, forming the top of the box burial, the
whole being supported by two side posts set in the ground and held
together by cross-pieces.

The details of the burials differed at different villages, but in any
one burial place there was great similarity, suggesting that all or most
of the burials at a given site were made by some one individual, an
“undertaker.” The nature of the burial in these cases had a great ef-
fect on the preservation of the remains, some of these being in excel-
lent condition, some crushed more or less and rotted. The burials
under Russian influence were all ground burials, with simple, nailed
coffins, two to three feet of earth and a sod or plank covering on the
top, headed by a Russian cross.

The skeletal remains from the older box burials have proved to be
of much more than usual interest from both the anthropological and
the medical points of view. Over one hundred of the older skeletons
were collected and more examined. They showed the following prin-
cipal features :

1. The type of the skull and the stature are about the same as
those of the people of today on the river. No marked change has
taken place in these respects evidently within many generations of
these people. The nature of the type, its sameness over a large ter-
ritory, and its extension well into the pre-Russian times, are facts of
much anthropological importance.

2. There is a remarkable freedom from fractures. There were
found no wounds of the skull or face, no fracture of the ribs, and
only two breaks of the long and other bones. These surely were no
fighting people or people given to violent exercise or sports.

3. There is no trace in the older burials of tuberculosis. Two cases
that were encountered, were from burials of late Russian or earlier
post-Russian times (near or after 1867). It is positive therefore that
tuberculosis had not existed among these people before the contact
with whites. It was evidently brought here by the Russians. This
explains the present general lack of immunity against this scourge.
Every one of these people must be regarded as predisposed to the
disease, which is of consequence in dealing with them medically, in
schools and otherwise.

4. None of the bones collected or seen showed any trace of cancer,
tumors, inflammation, syphilis, or rachitis; and there were no signs of
Scurvy.

5. The prevailing pathological conditions in the older individuals
were those of the spine, accompanied occasionally with those of the
joints, and were arthritic in nature. All grades of arthritis deformans
were seen in the spine, from the beginning of marginal exostoses in
the lumbar and lower dorsal region to an ankylosis of the whole spine
due to fusion of those exostoses. In several cases two and in one
instance three of the cervicals were fused, with the rest of the spine
not much affected; in these cases there may have been some special
factor at play.

6. There were but a few really old people in these burials, show-
ing that real old age was rare; on the other hand there were but few
young adolescents or adults of both sexes, indicating lower mortality
among especially the young women than was found last year to have
prevailed on the Yukon. This indicates the absence on the Kuskokwim
of some pernicious habit that was present on the other river and that
probably related to the period of child bearing in the young women.

7. There were no perceptible traces in the burials of any Indian
influence or admixture.

The whole study shows the presence, along the 400 miles of the
lower Kuskokwim River and its bay, of a rather large and, in many
parts of the region, still mostly fullblood population, of remarkably
homogeneous character, and constituting the bulk of the western
Eskimo. It makes it certain that this type did not arise through mix-
ture with the Indian, but that it represents a pure old Eskimo strain, to
which conform a large majority of the Eskimo people in the Bering
Sea together with such important groups as those of Point Hope,
Smith Sound and elsewhere. This is, according to present indications,
the parental or basic type, from which the narrower and more keel-
shaped skull type of parts of the Seward Peninsula and the Arctic, and

especially that of southeastern Greenland and of Labrador, has been
developed.

Thus the work of the last few years throws a new light on the whole
Eskimo problem and brings it near, it would seem, to its final solution.

The work of the last two years indicates also much as to the future
of the Alaska Eskimo. He has a high mortality, but even higher
fecundity. He is not dying out and will not do so. But he is becoming
rapidly admixed with white blood. Part of this came from the Rus-
sians, part from marriages or unions of later whites with the attrac-
tive native women; and the mixedbloods are diffusing the blood among
the rest of the people. In all probability no pureblood Eskimo will
be born a century from now. Thus as a pureblood the western Alaska
Eskimo will in a few generations become largely if not entirely a
matter of scientific history. But the Eskimo-white population promises
to increase rather than decrease. The tuberculous troubles are already
frequently assuming a chronic form, and there are many cases of
partial and even complete recovery. With increasing knowledge the
people will also be able to better care for themselves. Thus it may
safely be expected that the Eskimo population, though more or less
altered in blood, will remain to form the human backbone of these
far away coasts and rivers. With this in view, everything possible
should be done towards curing and safeguarding this good, happy,
tractable, and already fairly civilized people, from their one great
scourge, tuberculosis, which is of white man’s introduction.

Assistant Curator, Division of Ethnology, U. S. National Museum

On May 13 Mr. J. A. Ford and I sailed from Seattle on the Coast
Guard Cutter Northland for the purpose of conducting archeological
investigations on St. Lawrence Island, near Bering Strait. This was
my third consecutive cruise on the Northland and again I wish to thank
Capt. E. D. Jones and the officers and men of the ship, especially
Lieut. Comdr. N. R. Stiles, and Mr. H. Berg, for the many courtesies
shown us.

In 1928 and 1929 my excavations on Punuk and St. Lawrence
Islands had revealed the existence of a prehistoric phase of Eskimo
culture ancestral to the modern in that region and derived apparently
from a still earlier phase, the only evidence of which was a few elabo-
rately decorated artifacts of walrus ivory that had been found at
various old sites in the vicinity of Bering Strait. This oldest phase of
Alaskan Eskimo culture, the Old Bering Sea culture, appears to be the
oldest that has been found anywhere in the Eskimo regions. It also
possessed an art richer and more complex than that of any later Arctic
culture. The intermediate or Punuk stage showed similar implement
types, but the decorative designs, while they bore sufficient resem-
blances to those of the Old Bering Sea culture to warrant the assump-
tion that they had been derived therefrom, had become less flowing and
profuse and had taken on a rigidity more like that of modern Eskimo
aides

While such a development of Alaskan Eskimo culture seemed cer-
tainly to have taken place, much of the evidence was of an indirect
nature, for at the sites excavated in 1928 and 1929 I had found an
abundance of the Punuk art but hardly more than traces of that of
the Old Bering Sea period—not enough to afford evidence of the exact
relationship at these particular sites of the two old art styles. It was
very desirable, therefore, to find some old site at which occurred

both the Old Bering Sea and the Punuk cultures, so that by strati-
graphic excavation their relationship might be determined definitely.

In 1928 and again in 1929 the Northland stopped for a day at Gam-
bell (Sevuokok) at the northwestern end of St. Lawrence Island and
I had an opportunity to examine several deserted village sites in the
immediate vicinity. From the nature of the artifacts that had been
excavated from them—some collected for me by Paul Silook, an Es-
kimo at Gambell, and some shown to me by Mr. Otto Wm. Geist, who
had been collecting for the Alaska Agricultural College—it was plain
that these villages were of different ages. Only one of them had yielded
artifacts bearing the Old Bering Sea ornamentation, and this was also
the site which from its position in relation to former beach lines
appeared to be the most ancient. Here then, at Gambell, was a series
of old sites which gave promise of yielding the precise information
needed as to the cultural changes that had taken place on St. Lawrence
Island in prehistoric times, and it was accordingly selected as a place
for investigation.

Situated at the northwestern extremity of St. Lawrence Island,
the Eskimo village of Gambell is only 40 miles from the Siberian coast
which on any clear day is plainly visible. The 200 inhabitants live dur-
ing the winter in domed skin-covered houses with inner skin sleeping
room such as are also used by their Eskimo kinsmen in Siberia and
by the coast dwelling Chukchee ; the smaller skin structures formerly
used as summer dwellings have been almost entirely replaced by neat
lumber houses, outward evidence of the-prosperity that has lately come
to these Eskimo, principally from furs.

The present houses are built at the far end of a flat gravel spit
which extends westward for three-quarters of a mile from the base
of the low Gambell Mountain. From the top of this mountain one has
a clear view of the old beach lines, which, extending east and west
on the gravel spit below, show the manner in which the spit has been
built up. At the base of the mountain is the old village of Miyowagha-
meet, enclosed within the first and second (the earliest) beach lines,
and at the present time three-fourths, and half of a mile distant from
the sea. Since all maritime Eskimo villages are built close to the
sea it is only reasonable to assume that when Miyowaghameet was
occupied the sea was much nearer and that the greater part of the
present gravel spit has been built up subsequently.

Some 200 yards to the northward is a smaller village site, levog-
hiyogameet, its grass covered midden rising like a small island from
the flat gravel plain. This village is separated from Miyowaghameet
by four old beach lines, while to the northward six more beach lines

lie between it and the sea. Its position would thus indicate that it had
been built later than Miyowaghameet and that during the time of its
occupancy and after its abandonment the sea had receded still fur-
ther, piling up still more gravel ridges.

Toward the end of the spit, behind the present village is the third
old village, Seklowaghayaget, but its position with reference to the
old beach lines is not so clear. Finally, immediately to the south of
the present village are the ruins of the semi-subterranean houses of
wood and whale bones, the last of which were occupied as late as 40
years ago.

In the kitchen-middens and house pits of these old villages we and
our Eskimo helpers excavated from June 20 to October 20. Our
method of excavation was to sink pits 12 feet square at various places
in the middens, taking them down in sections of a few inches thick-
ness as the frozen ground slowly thawed upon exposure to the atmos-
phere. As the work progressed we began to uncover a great variety
of objects—ivory, bone, stone, pottery, wood, baleen—representing
the hunting implements, tools, household equipment, ornaments and
other possessions of a people who were seen to have been uncommonly
skillful in shaping to their ends the material resources at their com-
mand. The objects excavated number several thousand, and repre-
sent a complete cross section of Eskimo culture at this one spot from
the earliest known period down to the present.

We had been excavating about a week when almost by accident we
made a discovery that added greatly to the significance of these old
villages as landmarks of Eskimo chronology. Just back of Miyo-
waghameet, on the lower part of the mountain slope, we found a site
of pure Old Bering Sea culture. The trail to the top of the mountain
passed over the surface of this old village and although many genera-
tions of Eskimo had followed it not one of those now living had sus-
pected that anything lay beneath the moss and rocks. But this is easy
to understand for the surface showed not the slightest irregularity, nor
were there any timbers or whale bones or shallow depressions of house
pits, such as usually mark the sites of old Eskimo villages. Only at
one place was any refuse visible and this a small patch less than two
feet square which by weathering had become exposed in a rock crev-
ice. The rest of the midden for many yards around was so completely
covered with moss and sod and fallen rocks that it blended perfectly
into the hillside. As our work progressed it became clear that this
site had been both settled and abandoned within the period of the Old
Bering Sea culture, for from top to bottom of the small midden the
about 30—were all of the Old Bering Sea style

decorated objects

with no trace of the later Punuk art. Many undecorated objects
were also found, revealing for the first time the common implement
types of the Old Bering Sea culture. Harpoon heads were of various
types: with closed and open shaft sockets, with one, two, or three
spurs, with end blades and with side blades.’

At Miyowaghameet, the next oldest site, the eastern and southern
parts of the midden were found to continue deep below the sod and
to be practically continuous with the old hillside midden. The deco-
rated objects from this section of Miyowaghameet belonged also to
the Old Bering Sea period, but already a change was noticeable; the
designs, while still very elaborate, were somewhat uniform, in con-
trast to those of the hillside site which displayed more freedom in
the utilization of the various design elements. However, the most
beautiful objects were those belonging to this later stage of the Old
Bering Sea Culture. At the upper levels of the eastern and southern
sections of the Miyowaghameet midden were found a few scattered
objects bearing the simple line and dot ornamentation of the Punuk
period. At the opposite or northern and western parts of the midden
Punuk art was found from the surface to a depth of about 5 feet,
but below that Old Bering Sea pieces were the prevailing forms. A
similar condition was found in regard to harpoon heads. Those from
the older sections were mostly of the complicated Old Bering Sea
types while the later ones, of Punuk age, were simpler in form as
well as decoration.

It is evident, therefore, that when the first settlers came to Miyo-
waghameet—no doubt from the hillside village—they brought the
Old Bering Sea culture with them. Somewhat later, as the village
expanded to the northward and westward the rich old art had been
replaced by the simplified art of the Punuk period. New types of
harpoon heads appeared and some of the old types were discontinued.
There were likewise changes in some of the other implement types but
on the whole the material culture was not greatly altered.

The Punuk art, which had appeared in the later sections of Miyo-
waghameet, had continued to flourish at the next oldest village, now
represented by the levoghiyogameet midden. But here it underwent
certain changes ; the lines became straighter and deeper, and mechani-
cally made circles appeared. Harpoon heads became simpler in form

*Harpoon heads are seen to have assumed a wide variety of forms on
St. Lawrence Island in prehistoric times but their development was along lines
that to a considerable degree can be traced; there is reason to believe that
these implements will have relatively as important a role in the elucidation of
problems of Eskimo prehistory as pottery has had in the Southwest.

and included a few examples typical of the Thule culture, an extinct
Eskimo culture which formerly centered about Hudson’s Bay.

At Seklowaghayaget we found again only the Punuk art. The
harpoon heads from the lower levels of the midden were of the type
found at levoghiyogameet but the simplification that had been in proc-
ess at that place had here gone still further, for those found in the
upper levels of the Seklowaghayaget midden were mainly of two types,
one, evidently local, a small flat undecorated head with open shaft
socket which in cross section approaches a triangular shape, and the
other a small open socket head of Thule type without end blade.

As Seklowaghayaget became abandoned, houses were built near by,
immediately to the south of the present village, and these and the mid-
dens about them represent the latest of the five abandoned sites in the
vicinity of Gambell. The two types of harpoon heads last mentioned
had continued in use but the local type with almost triangular socket
underwent a series of rather rapid changes and emerged as the thick,
iron-bladed, closed-socketed form of the present time. The refuse
about these latest ruins yielded a few examples of Punuk art, but more
of the modern. Glass beads and iron were also found as well as a
number of modern types of implements that had not appeared at the
older sites.

In addition to the stratigraphic excavations made in the middens,
ten house-pits were dug, one or more at each of the old sites. The
houses of the Old Bering Sea period, heretofore unknown, were found
to be small semi-subterranean structures, square in outline, with stone
floors and walls of small driftwood timbers laid horizontally. There
was a narrow entrance passage at a slightly lower level, with stone
floor and walls and flat wooden roof.

The earlier houses of the Punuk period were of exactly the same
type but of larger dimensions. At one place in the Miyowaghameet
midden, evidence of direct superposition was found: the corner of
one of these larger houses, in which only Punuk art was found, had
been built over the fallen wall of a smaller house from which came
decorated pieces only of the Old Bering Sea type. In the later part
of the Punuk period, house walls were made of stones and bones,
principally whale vertebrae and walrus skulls. There was also an
enlargement of, and sometimes an annex to the entrance passage, for
use as a store room or for cooking. Wooden floors and walls of small
upright timbers were found only in the latest house ruins.

The excavations at Gambell have thus revealed in considerable detail
the long succession of cultural changes that came about in past cen-
turies as one village after another was established and then abandoned.
SMITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, 1930 143

The resulting chronology, as outlined above, is based on three main
lines of evidence: stratigraphy, the evidence of the old beach lines,
and the demonstrable succession of art styles and implement types.
The value of the chronology that is thus set up will in a wider sense
be determined by the extent to which it can be applied to the elucida-
tion of cultural sequences elsewhere in the Eskimo regions. We know
that the material culture of the modern St. Lawrence Island Eskimo
stands somewhat apart from the rest of Alaska, being derived for the
most part from the Siberian Eskimo who in turn have been strongly
influenced in comparatively late times by the Chukchee. As we go

trance shown in background. At center foreground the rear wall extends

further back, however, it is seen that the St. Lawrence Eskimo,
instead of being isolated, shared in the earlier and artistically more
highly developed culture that formerly extended over a large part of
northern Alaska and northeastern Siberia. For the Old Bering Sea
culture is known to have existed also on the Siberian coast, the
Diomede Islands, at Cape Prince of Wales, Point Hope, and Point
Barrow, while the later Punuk art has been found at the Diomedes
and at Point Hope. With regard to the relationship of the old Thule
culture of the East, it is significant that on St. Lawrence Island definite
Thule types do not appear until well into the Punuk period. This is
in keeping with the general situation in Alaska wherever Thule types
I44 SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

are found; they seem to be always later than those of the Old Bering
Sea culture. From present indications it appears probable that careful
excavations around Point Barrow would reveal the best evidence of
the exact relationship between these two old Eskimo cultures. Equally
important is the question of the relation of the Old Bering Sea cul-
ture to the existing Eskimo groups between Bristol Bay and the Yukon
and even to the Indians of the Northwest Coast, such as the Tlingit
and Haida. Then there remains the most important problem of all—
the origin of the Old Bering Sea culture itself; but this, as well as the
other problems of Eskimo archeology can only be solved by further
excavations.

While the Northland was staying at Unalaska for a few days in
June and again in November we were able to make limited excava-
tions at three ancient Aleutian sites on Amaknak Island. The midden
deposits were of considerable size, ranging in depth from 5 to 15
feet. They were also easy to excavate, for unlike those on St. Lawrence
Island, they were not frozen. However, compared with the Eskimo
middens, they yielded but few artifacts, none of which were compar-
able either in art or craftsmanship with ancient Eskimo specimens.
The prehistoric Aleuts seem to have possessed a rather simple mate-
rial culture which continued with little or no change during the cen-
turies that they inhabited these barren and inhospitable islands.

Fifty skulls and skeletons were collected at an old Eskimo site
near Rocky Point, on Norton Sound, but probably none were over 100
years old. Twenty King Island Eskimos at Nome were measured
and 60 St. Lawrence Islanders at Gambell; on the latter group hand
and foot prints were also taken.

The most interesting feature of the season’s work, aside from the
archeological finds at Gambell, was the discovery of a fossil-bearing
coal and shale outcrop of Tertiary age, rich with the remains of
sequoia, poplar, and other plants. Prof. R. W. Chaney, of the Carnegie
Institution of Washington, is responsible for the discovery, for it
was he who requested that I try to locate such fossils. The existence
of fossils of sequoia and other trees on the now barren St. Lawrence
Island is regarded by Professor Chaney as affording conclusive evi-
dence of a former land connection between Asia and America; for
sequoia, which at the present time are restricted to California, have
been found as fossils in Southeast Alaska, Northeastern Siberia and
Mongolia. Paleontologists have long assumed that there must have
existed a land bridge between Asia and America in the region of
Bering Strait, in Tertiary times, for in no other way could the simi-
larity of the fauna and flora of the two continents be explained.
PREHISTORIC SANTO DOMINGAN KITCHEN-MIDDENS.
CEMETERIES, AND EARTHWORKS

By HERBERT W. KRIEGER,
Curator, Division of Ethnology, U. S. National Museum

The third consecutive season of archeological work in Santo
Domingo was begun in January and concluded in May, 1930. As
in preceding years, the work was made possible through a subvention
of Dr. W. L. Abbott, who had previously conducted biological investi-
gations principally in the high mountains surrounding Constanza val-
ley, and on the southern slopes of the Central Cordillera in the prov-
ince of Azua.

The season’s work opened on the south coast, at the little Domini-
can village of Andres on the Bahia de Andres, an arm of the Carib-
bean, situated approximately 30 kilometers east of the capital city of
Santo Domingo. The writer first became interested in what had been
reported as an Arawak burial ground at Boca Chica, when viewing in
March, 1929, the collection of Senor Andres Socias, of Copey, Monte
Cristi Province. In that collection was an earthenware vessel differ-
ent from the usual type of pottery from the north coast of Santo
Domingo. Senor Socias had obtained the vessel several years previ-
ously from a friend residing at Boca Chica. The Indian burial ground
at Boca Chica (Andres) had in the meantime been worked by Mr.
Thomas Howell, of New York, the president of the Compania
Azucarera Boca Chica. In 1928 while excavating for a new sugar
warehouse many skulls, skeletons, and accompanying pottery vessels
were uncovered. Before Howell’s attention was directed to these finds
a large number of earthenware vessels had been wantonly destroyed
by the laborers.

In 1930 the writer proceeded to Andres hoping to learn more of
the culture stratification in the adjoining kitchen-midden. Mr. Fox,
the resident manager of the concern, during the absence of Mr.
Howell, kindly granted the writer permission to carry on investiga-
tions for the Smithsonian Institution on the property directly in
front of the sugar warehouses where most of the finds were being
made. Local officials of the Dominican Government granted permis-
sion to explore within the confines of the adjoining village of Andres.
Living quarters were supplied by the Compania Azucarera, the offi-
cials of which assisted the undertaking in every possible manner.

The former aboriginal village site at Andres extends along the
coast all the way from Boca Chica, at the eastern end of the Bay of
Andres, through the village of Andres near the western end of the
bay, where it terminates abruptly in front of the warehouses of the
Boca Chica Sugar Central. The unusually extensive shell midden
characterizing this ancient Arawak settlement rests directly on a bed
of coral rock. Directly fronting the warehouses and refinery build-
ings is a large sand spit projecting out into the bay and covering to a
depth of 3 to 10 feet or more the coral rock which underlies the entire
area. This sand spit was utilized by the former aboriginal occupants
of the region as the only possible burial ground within an extensive
area along the southeastern Santo Domingan coast. It was here that
they buried with their dead many bowls, food dishes, and water jars.

The Andres-Boca Chica site is perhaps the most extensive of any
West Indian archeological station known at the present time. More
skulls and earthenware vessels and other objects representative of
Arawak culture have been recovered intact than from all other known
sites in the West Indies combined. There is a remarkable uniformity
throughout, both as to midden deposits and as to burial offerings,
which had apparently not been disturbed, a favored position for the
water jars being at either side and for the food dishes directly in
front of the flexed skeleton.

After making a representative collection of anteriorly deformed
Arawak crania through excavating in front of the sugar warehouse
and later within the village of Andres, studies were made of the
midden deposits. These consisted for the most part of a dense layer
of conch shells (Strombus pugilis L.) intermingled with fish bones,
leg bones and carapaces of turtle, and of mandibles of several species
of crab. The midden deposits resting on the solid coral do not
exceed 5 feet in depth. A thin stratum of soil covers the midden. No
stratigraphic changes within the midden were apparent at the places
where test excavations were made.

The next project to be undertaken during the 1930 season was in
the nature of an archeological reconnoissance in the high mountain
valleys of the provinces of La Vega and Azua. The mountainous
backbone of the island, the Cordillera Central, starts from low hills
in the Republic of Haiti on the east and attains its greatest height in
the west central part of Santo Domingo. The range appears as a
jumble of ridges and peaks and flat valleys. There are outcroppings of
many different kinds of rocks—effusive and intrusive igneous rocks,
schists and other metamorphics, and a great variety of sedimentary

rocks, including coral beds in the vicinity of Loma de Rio Grande
south of Constanza.

The highway across the Cordillera Central from Santo Domingo
City by way of the carretera Duarte passes through the town of
Bonao, a town of 1,000 inhabitants, and terminates at La Vega. This
is a well improved automobile highway and even from the seat of
a speeding automobile one obtains a view of the surrounding country-
side remarkable for its native and undeveloped beauty. La Vega
is reached all too soon and the hunt is begun for a light car to take
one on the first lap of the journey into the heart of the Cordillera.

The goal of the journey is the valley of Constanza, well known to
naturalists from the days of Humboldt, Schomburgk, and Gabb. In
recent years Abbott, Wetmore, Ekman, and others, including Wythe
Cook of the survey party conducting a geological reconnoissance of
the Dominican Republic, have carried on investigations in their re-
spective fields along the Constanza trail.

One branch of this trail starts at Santiago de los Caballeros, passes
southward along the east side of the Rio Yaque del Norte to the town
of Baitoa. Later the Santiago trail is united with the La Vega branch
of the Constanza trail which is passable for light automobiles, and
trucks as far as Jarabacoa, although much work remains to be done
in the way of bridge building and grading. The Rio Yami must
be forded, as must also the Rio Jimenoa, before the immediate goal,
the town of Jarabacoa, is reached, where the automobile is discarded
for pack saddle and mule train.

After leaving the valley of the Jimenoa and the proximity of
Jarabacoa, the climb up the steep and rocky defile of the Arroyo
Baiguate brings one to the top of El Barrero. The narrow trail, fol-
lowing the crests of ridges that buttress the narrow mountain crest,
descends the southern slope and again ascends to El Paso Bajito,
once more encountering the Rio Jimenoa which is forded at El Rio.
Here, in the narrow flat valley may be seen aboriginal earthworks
resembling very much those to be described later from Constanza.
After leaving El Rio one must ascend another mountain crest, the
Loma del Hato Quemado which marks the watershed between the
waters flowing east into the Camu and Yuna Rivers which empty
themselves into the Bay of Samana on the Dominican east coast.

Circling along the crests of ridges in a general southerly direction,
the trail descends to the narrow valley of the upper Tireo River, a
tributary of the Yuna River, where several aboriginal earthworks
of the Constanza type were observed. There were also observed
scattered groups of the peculiar natural mounds, resulting from ex-
foliation, but which are locally known as Indian burial mounds.

From the valley of the Rio Tireo, the final ascent up the flank of
the Loma del Valle brought into view the panorama of the flat valley
of Constanza framed by encircling mountains. The valley occupies an
area of 30 square kilometers and lies at an altitude of 1,100 meters
above sea level. At its southeastern corner two tiny rivulets, the
Pantufle and the Rio Constanza, drain the valley and unite to form
the Rio Limon. The village of Constanza is sheltered under tower-
ing mountains at the northeast corner of the valley. Just north of the
village is the largest of the series of parallel aboriginal earthworks,
first described by Schomburgk in 1851.

Living quarters were obtained in the house of Senor Felix Matias,
a kindly Dominican, whose aid in obtaining permits to carry on exca-
vations was much appreciated and is here gratefully acknowledged.
Laborers were readily obtained and within a few days a system of
procedure was developed. Two apparently “ natural born” archeolo-
gists, Antonio M. Garcia, the local weather observer for the Domini-
can government, and a campesino who answered to the simple name
of Pong, began a systematic survey of the surrounding mountains
in search of caves or rock ledges containing Indian burials. In this
they were quite successful.

In the rock ledge burials on the flanks of the Loma la Cumbre
between the Rio Tireo and the Jimenoa; on the slopes of Loma de
Rio Grande, Monte Culo de Maco, Loma Rucilla, or Pico del Yaque,
Loma Chinguela, and Monte Cucurucho, and of the hills in the more
immediate vicinity of Constanza careful search was made for burial
offerings. A few stone beads, pendants, zemis, fragments of burial
pottery, also a small number of intact earthenware vessels were dis-
covered in juxtaposition to the skeletal remains.

Under the tutelage of a Dominican whose family name is forgotten,
but whose given name of Josesito seemed particularly appropriate,
the writer began a search within the valley of Constanza for a domi-
ciliary midden sufficiently well preserved to yield cultural material
for stratigraphic study. At many places in Constanza valley, also in
the upper valley of the Tireo, pottery sherds were examined. Upon
investigation the culture deposit invariably proved to be merely a few
inches in depth and unsuitable for excavation. Opportunity was seized
on these reconnoitering trips to purchase any archeological specimen
offered. Soon the entire countryside became engaged in commercial
archeology, but the ideal midden deposit remained undiscovered.

Many natural formations resembling small circular artificial earth
mounds, said to be Indian burials, were reported from widely sepa-
rated locations, but on investigation they proved to be unusually ex-
SM ITHSONIAN EXPLORATIONS, I930 153

foliated masses of rock and pebbles in circular heaps from five to eight
feet in diameter projecting from one to four feet above the surround-
ing soil level under which lay rock fragments and pebbles similarly
exfoliated and disintegrated. The regularity of these natural mounds,
dotting a flat valley floor in a striking way, is remarkable. The proof
that they could not be aboriginal burials was near at hand if one were
provided with pick and shovel. Test holes were made of these peculiar
formations at Manabao, also in the valley of the Rio Tireo, and in
the valley of Constanza on the otherwise level valley floor between
the village of Constanza and the streamlet named Pantufle.

Sir Robert Schomburgk in an article in the Athenaeum published
in 1851 reported the presence of an Indian cemetery in the valley of
Constanza and offers as evidence the following data: “ Nearby is a
burial ground toward the foot of the southern mountains of the
valley—one hour of brisk walking through pine forests brought us to
a rivulet. Here were earthworks of semi-circular form. Crossing the
brook were burials covered with greenstone in circular form bounded
by the mound, the rivulet, and the pine forest.’’ Obviously Schom-
burgk did not dig into these mounds as he makes no further mention
of them. His observation has, however, been recorded on his map of
the Dominican Republic, and for many years thereafter all maps of the
country indicated the presence of an Indian cemetery in the valley of
Constanza. Nearby, just above the waterfall locally known as El
Chorro southeast of Constanza village, begins the rocky crest of a
hogback, a long upward-sloping hill, under the scattered comb of
which the writer was successful in recovering skeletal and cranial
fragments along with pottery offerings. This cyclopean-like outcrop-
ping of faulted rock has been mistakenly cited by some writers as an
aboriginal monumental wall erected for defense.

The culturally more advanced Arawak of the mountainous in-
terior of Santo Domingo deserve to be classified with the Mississippi
Valley mound builders, even though they did not construct burial
mounds. Many artificial structures of earth were erected by them
principally in the uplifted valleys of the northern central mountain
ranges of Santo Domingo. Some of these mounds, varying in height
but never exceeding more than a few feet at most, are round, others
are rectangular. Most of them, however, are in the form of two par-
allel embankments. Four series of these parallel embankments were
observed by the writer in the valley of Constanza. Their average
height is from 3 to 10 feet, with a width of 20 feet in transverse sec-
tion at the bottom. The mounds are free from rocks and contain

practically no artifacts except occasionally a broken celt, hammer-
stone, or broken sherd from some water vessel or food bowl. At their
bottom beneath the embankment at a level with the adjoining terrain,
we again find the same soil that normally appears elsewhere as a
surface stratum, showing that the entire structure had been laboriously
piled up by the natives with earth from nearby fields for some un-
known purpose.

The 1930 season concludes the series of archeological investiga-
tions conducted by the Smithsonian Institution and the United States
National Museum in the territory of the Dominican Republic. Ac-
knowledgment is made of the courtesy and aid extended by Domini-
can government officials both in the capital city of Santo Domingo
and in the provinces. It is hoped that the work accomplished may be
of benefit to students of West Indian archeology generally and to
those interested in correlating the northern and southern affiliations of
Floridian and of Gulf State mound cultures.
ARIZONA'S )}PREHISTORIC CANALS, FROM THE AIR*
By NEIL M. JUDD,

Curator, Division of Archeology, U. S. National Museum

Out in central Arizona, where cotton fields, citrus groves and date
palms reach out across endless miles to caress jagged igneous and
sandstone buttes, prehistoric peoples once erected a noteworthy civilt-
zation upon an agricultural foundation. That ancient civilization 1s
gone now—lost with the desert acres on which it flourished—and
few traces remain of the gigantic canals that made its primitive agri-
culture possible.

But those few traces merit careful preservation. They are all we
have left to remind us of that unnamed, aboriginal folk whose engi-
neering achievements rightfully arrest the attention of our mechanical
age. For those prehistoric canals—it has been estimated that half a
century ago there were no less than 300 miles of them in the Salt
River valley alone—were so accurately and efficiently constructed that
portions of them, taken over by white settlers of 1870 and thereabouts,
are actually in use at the present time. And here is another point we
are apt to overlook: Every mile of those ancient channels was lit-
erally dug by hand, since the Arizona Indians knew nothing either
of beasts of burden or metal tools until well on in the seventeenth
century.

Following the old canal banks, one occasionally happens upon the
fragment of a stone “ hoe ”—a thin blade of igneous rock, chipped on
one side to a cutting edge. With such rude tools, with fractured cob-
blestones and sharpened sticks, the canal builders hacked and prodded
at the hard desert soil. In baskets and blankets, we may safely con-
jecture, women and children carried the loosened earth out from the
excavation. Thus, mile after weary mile, an entire community labored
to construct the canals that watered their communal fields.

Nowhere else in the New World has evidence been found of pre-
historic irrigation systems comparable to those of central Arizona.
They may even have surpassed, both in size and in the number of
acres served, those famous systems of the Tigris and Euphrates val-
leys—irrigation works that watered the seed of native ability and

In December, 1930, Mr. Odd S. Halseth, of Phoenix, was continuing cer-
tain studies connected with this aerial survey, in behalf of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology.

brought forth into full bloom high civilizations that made Mesopo-
tamia known throughout the ancient world.

With prodigious labor, the Peruvians of pre-Spanish times led ir-
rigation ditches along craggy heights of the Andes to their terraced
gardens. Among the highlands of Mexico and again in various sec-
tions of the southwestern United States, Indian farmers had learned
that irrigation was necessary to the successful cultivation of food
crops. In November, 1694, Padre Eusebio Kino stood before the drab
walls of Casa Grande ruin and speculated upon the feasibility of
restoring its abandoned, overgrown canals. Five hundred years before
Kino was born the inhabitants of Pueblo Bonito, in Chaco Canyon,
New Mexico, were capturing the mid-summer rains, taming and guid-
ing them onto thirsty fields. But none of these efforts matched the
colossal, prehistoric irrigation systems of the Gila and Salt river
valleys.

We wanted maps of these latter, hand-made Indian canals. We
wanted to know their extent, their position relative to each other, the
approximate acreage they once watered. Similar desires on the part
of other observers had prompted surveys which were not altogether
successful for the very simple reason that so little is now visible of the
ancient ditches. Modern agriculture has been too destructive; it has
plowed and planted until the aboriginal farming communities and their
works were pretty thoroughly obliterated. From the ground, one’s
range of vision is too limited; from the air it might be possible to
recover data for the maps we had in mind. At least this seemed the
most promising, expeditious method when I made a preliminary study
of the situation in the autumn of 1929."

So, at the solicitation of United States Senator Carl Hayden, the
Smithsonian Institution and the War Department cooperated in an
aerial survey of the Salt and Gila river valleys, beginning late in
January, 1930. Lieutenant Edwin Bobzien and Sergeant R. A. Stock-
well, pilot and photographer, respectively, were detailed from the
Air Corps unit at Crissy Field, San Francisco, and I was designated
Smithsonian representative, to advise with the aviators.

Our small party assembled at Phoenix, blocked out the areas to be
photographed and speedily set to work. Smoke and ground haze drew
an impenetrable blanket over Salt River valley each morning and
evening, thus restricting flying time to a brief two hours at midday
when shadows are at a minimum. The longer shadows of early morn-

ing and late afternoon would naturally have thrown into greater relief
those slight elevations which mark ancient house sites and irrigation
ditches.

But, despite handicaps of various sorts, our air survey proceeded
about as we had planned it. First of all there was the Gila River val-
ley, from its union with the Rio Salado to the northwestern slopes of
the Tortilla Mountains—a far-reaching plain whereon Pima and
Papago farmers tilled favored patches of irrigable land long before
the advent of missionaries, trappers, Pony Express riders, and other
pioneers of a period now all but forgotten.

American settlers trailed into the upper Gila valley during the third
quarter of the nineteenth century and drew so heavily upon the avail-
able water supply that the Indian farmers below were finally brought
to a state of destitution. Government promises of relief were made
and remade but a half century passed before the Coolidge Dam was
completed and provision thus made to meet the needs of whites and
Indians alike. The great reservoir 1s slowly filling and, 70 miles away,
farm lands wait thirstily for the life-giving waters.

With huge, snorting machines that make an Indian’s home-made
tools seem, by comparison, as nothing at all, 56,000 acres of desert
land are being cleared, leveled, and otherwise prepared for irrigation
at the rate of 20 acres a day. But the mechanical monsters of the
modern engineer are no respecters of prehistoric canals! The latter
were being destroyed along with other heritages from the past. Ours
was the task of discerning and recording some vestige of those ancient
irrigation systems while fleeting opportunity permitted.

Up one side of the Gila and down the other, Lieutenant Bobzien
held his blue Douglas observation plane on a fixed course at 10,000
feet elevation while Sergeant Stockwell pointed his camera through a
hole in the floor and snapped the shutter with clock-like precision to
picture a square mile on each successive negative. Over famed Casa
Grande ruins the ship sailed lower in search of those ancient canals
seen by Kino and which new cotton fields seem to have erased abso-
lutely. And then back to the Indian gardens that border the meander-
ing Gila from Sacaton to Pima Butte and beyond.

Like strips of Grandmother’s quilt those gardens are! Queer, mis-
shapen patches with thin ribbons of dark green running this way and
that where lesser irrigation ditches crazy-stitched the variegated scraps
together. Yet, hopelessly confused and insignificant as these minia-
ture farms appear from a height of nearly two miles, they played a
not unimportant part in the conquest of southern Arizona.

Indian farmers tended those fertile fields for untold generations
before Francisco Vasquez de Coronado and his band of resolute ad-
venturers marched gayly northward out of Mexico in 1540 to dig
mythical gold from the Seven Cities of Cibola. When Padre Kino
came plodding his patient way toward salvation of the Pima and
Papago tribes late in the seventeenth century, those funny Indian gar-
dens fed his men and mules. And they supported, too, the westward-
bound gold-seekers of ’49; the animals and personnel both of the
Pony Express and the later stagecoach companies; the U. S. Army
units stationed in Arizona before and after the Civil War. Except for
those gardens and the Pima and Papago scouts who served so faith-
fully throughout the protracted Apache campaign, Victorio and
Geronimo doubtless would have continued their murderous depreda-
tions for still another decade. The peaceful Indian tribes of the Gila
valley have well merited, and with interest, the Government-aided
irrigation system which once more makes possible the successful cul-
tivation of their Lilliputian farms.

In the Salt River valley, prehistoric peoples also converted cacti-
covered wastes into gardens of maize, beans, and squashes. They
built, nearby, thick-walled, flat-roofed homes of mud, pressed and
patted into layer upon layer. Here, as along the Gila, industrious
generations dwelt in peace and plenty, tending their growing plants,
digging new ditches, hunting deer among thorny mesquite, until some
great, irresistible force came finally to claim possession. What that
force really was no one knows today. It may have been a slight diminu-
tion in annual rainfall; more likely, it was increasing pressure from
nomadic tribes. But, in either case, after a period which none may
yet measure, the Indian farmers of the Rio Salado vacated their
cultivated fields, abandoned their compact settlements and moved on
to other, perhaps less favored localities. Substantial dwellings
crumbled into low, spreading mounds ; irrigation systems slowly filled
with wind-driven sand; the desert crept back to claim its own.

Not until the middle nineteenth century did Salt River valley re-
awaken to such industry as it had known in prehistoric times. Not
until 1865, or thereabouts, did hardy pioneers follow in on the dim
trails of the beaver trappers and the gold-seekers to select the thorny
plains of the Rio Salado as a likely place in which to build their
humble homes.

Among these pioneers was one Jack Swilling, somewhat more
imaginative than his neighbors, who appears to have been the first to
recognize the possibility of local irrigation. Obviously influenced by
the nearby prehistoric canals, Swilling started to clear out one of

these as a ready means of watering his own fields. And then, in
1867, he organized the company which constructed the first modern
canal in Salt River valley.

Remnants of this old “ Swilling ditch ” and sections of three ancient
Indian canals are still visible in ““ The Park of Four Waters,” wisely
preserved by the city of Phoenix. Close by stands the ruin of Pueblo
Grande, a huge pile of crumbling walls and pale yellow clay, excava-
tion of which was initiated in 1929 by City Archeologist Odd A.
Halseth.

Largest surviving example of the communal dwellings which dotted
Salt River valley in prehistoric times, Pueblo Grande marks a former
center of population from which industrious Indian farmers trudged
forth to their daily toil. From the flat roofs of their earth-walled
homes those same farmers saluted the rising and setting sun as the
father of all living things. For in olden times, no less than today, the
sun meant life to dwellers in Salt River valley.

Over on the south side, Pioneer Charles T. Hayden camped one
day at the foot of Tempe Butte and watched the swollen river race
past. Then he constructed a rude ferry to float his wagons across;
remained to transport other early settlers, to build the first local store,
walled with mud-plastered willows. More than this, he cleaned out
an old Indian canal and drew into it, from the Rio Salado, water with
which to turn the wheels of his primitive mill. The new Hayden mill,
erected on the same site, is no longer powered by an irrigation ditch
but it served, nonetheless, as one of our principal landmarks in the
recent aerial survey of Salt River valley.

Mormon settlers came, in 1878, to found the contented village of
Mesa; to recondition other abandoned Indian canals and thus save
their pioneer community an estimated $20,000 in labor alone. Part of
one such rebuilt ditch is still in use but, as elsewhere in the valley,
increase in population has brought about larger, more serviceable
canals with their far-flung network of laterals.

Inquiry elicits the information that there are no fewer than 1,200
miles of these modern watercourses. Most of them measure from
18 to 90 feet wide at the top and average about five feet in depth; sec-
tions of them have cost as much as $22,000 a mile to construct. But
the prehistoric canal builders, with barefooted helpers instead of
caterpillar tractors, with stone hoes as precursors of the steam shovel,
unhesitatingly set about the completion of comparable works. I pho-
tographed one aboriginal canal north of Mesa that stands today 66 feet
wide and 8 feet deep. It led from the Rio Salado far across the valley ;
as the river cut its channel below the canal floor, the useless ditch

was replaced by another which connected with a new intake, farther
up stream. Such substitutions were necessitated by altered conditions
in prehistoric times no less than today.

Modern irrigation canals and the industry they symbolize have done
most to erase from central Arizona former vestiges of that native
civilization which once prospered there. The sad ruins of aboriginal
homes have been leveled with their neighboring fields; the ditches
which once watered those fields have been filled or scraped away.
Where Indian farmers eight or ten hundred years ago cultivated gar-
dens of beans, maize and squashes, vast acres of cotton, lettuce and
melons are now harvested. Neat orchards of dates and grapefruit
flourish where catclaw and mesquite stretched their spiny branches
only a generation ago. The diabolical Apache has been tamed if not
conquered. Bow-legged cowboys, garbed according to the latest fash-
ion notes from Hollywood, ride herd on eastern “ dudes.” Attractive
dwellings and sumptuous winter resorts, with green lawns and flower-
bordered walks have replaced the mud-walled habitations of the
ancient folk.

As one looks down from the air upon this Paradise that 1s Salt
River valley today, one is impressed first of all by the orderly habits
of mankind. At least there is a semblance of order, from a height of
2,000 feet or more. Long, straight roads on which autos slither away
like headless roaches; brown and yellow fields all nicely squared;
orange trees that seem as tiny pellets of dark green, patiently arranged,
row upon row; little cubed houses, fringed with flat green things.

Reaching across these fields and under these houses, light or dark
streaks mark former prehistoric Indian canals which only the avia-
tor may readily detect. Silt deposited in those old ditches shows
dark brown against the drab desert soil; pale yellow lines remain
where embankments have been smoothed away. Slight differences in
vegetation, imperceptible when close at hand, take on color variations
that enable one at a considerable height to retrace works which other-
wise have been wholly effaced.

The blue Army plane glides down from the clouds and back to port
with numbed crew and empty cameras. Camel Back Mountain squats
complacently at one side and looks out across the valley where such
momentous changes have taken place within memory of men still
living. Squaw Peak lifts her unkempt bulk to frown upon this new
civilization, as she did upon the old. A setting sun momentarily gilds
the giant sahuaro whose long, fingered shadows point eastwardly to
rugged mountain ranges whence flow the life-giving waters of the Gila
and the Rio Salado.
MOUNDS OF THE VANISHED CALUSA INDIANS
OF FLORIDA

By ME We Sie TRIEDNG,
Chief, Bureau of American Ethnology

When the Spaniards first visited the west coast of Florida early
in the sixteenth century, the region from Tampa Bay southward to
the Keys was occupied by the Calusa Indians. At this time they were
an important tribe, but in common with the other aboriginal Indians
of Florida they disappeared rapidly upon contact with the whites. Un-
fortunately no early traveler has left an adequate description of this
interesting group. As a result we must depend almost entirely upon
the results of archeological investigations in reconstructing their mode
of living.

It was for the purpose of continuing such researches that the writer
visited Florida during February, March, and April of 1930. Through
the kindness of Mr. Lee Parish, the writer was enabled to accompany
him on his yacht Esperanza through the intricate channels of the Ten
Thousand Islands, where a number of old village sites were located
and excavations conducted on a typical southern Calusa mound on
Horr’s Island. Numerous trade objects of European manufacture
discovered in course of the excavations helped to confirm the writer’s
previous view that the mounds of the Ten Thousand Island district
are probably the most recent in Florida. It was in this hidden and
comparatively inaccessible region that the Calusa Indians finally re-
tired as a result of pressure from the north and here made their
last stand against encroaching civilization. Here and there among
the maze of keys comprising the Ten Thousand Islands is one which
has caught the wind-blown sand in such a manner as to build it up,
forming “ high ground ” above the level of the surrounding mangrove
swamps. Such localities were invariably utilized by the Indians as
places of abode, the height of the ground in most instances being con-
siderably augmented by the accumulation of shells and village débris.

On the east end of Horr’s Island is a rather extensive shell deposit
now overgrown with a dense underbrush. Three hundred yards to
the eastward of the village site is a sand burial mound 35 feet in
diameter and 7 feet in height. Working among dense clouds of mos-
quitoes and sand flies, we excavated a sector of the mound compris-
ing about one-third of its volume. Seven burials were encountered,

all within 3 feet of the surface. These were secondary interments and
in no instance was the skeleton complete. Objects accompanying the
burials were scarce, consisting only of glass beads, an unidentified iron
object with crude repoussé designs upon it, perforated Arca shells and
conch shell cups.

After completing the work in Ten Thousand Islands the writer
proceeded to Lacoochee, Florida, where a mound on the south bank
of the Withlacoochee River was excavated. Upon the completion of
this task a site was selected at Safety Harbor, at the head of Old
Tampa Bay, where excavations were undertaken on the property of

Col. Thomas Palmer, to whose interest is due the preservation of this
interesting mound group. Permission was generously given to the
Bureau for the excavation of the large burial mound.

The principal mound of the group is a large, flat-topped shell mound
with precipitous sides. The waters of the bay have gradually en-
croached upon the site until the northern and eastern edges of the
mound are but a few yards from the water. Extending eastward from
the mound is a long sand spit which was formerly dry land and the
site of part of the village to which the mound belonged. Fifty yards
west of the large mound is a small shell mound about 7 feet high,
while 50 yards west of this is a low circular shell mound 45 feet in

diameter.

Four hundred yards to the west of the large mound is a sand burial
mound. This mound had been considerably dug over on the surface
by pot hunters, but it was so large that none of the diggers had pene-
trated very far. Just east of the mound was a deep circular depression
from which the material was taken for its construction. The complete
excavation of this mound showed that it had been raised by gradual
stages, the burials being of a secondary nature and placed without
order. Over 100 burials were removed and a considerable archeo-
logical collection obtained. The presence of such articles as a silver
tubular bead and an iron ax with burials in the top portion of the
mound showed that the latter stages were post-Columbian. No such
objects were found in the lower levels of the mound, where artifacts
of any kind were rare. Pottery, except for a few shards, was found
only on the surface at the base of the mound where food bowls had
evidently been placed as offerings, without interring them.

From the evidence gathered from the mound and village site it is
probable that this village was occupied at the time De Soto visited
Tampa Bay and continued to be inhabited for a considerable period
subsequently. Because of the fact that it bridges the period between
the historic and the prehistoric, it is of unusual interest to archeology.
ARCHEOLOGICAL RECONNAISSANCE IN TEXAS
AND NEVADA

By M. W. STIRLING,
Chief, Bureau of American Ethnology

An important area marginal to the well-known culture centers of
the pueblo section of the Southwest is the so-called Big Bend region
of Texas. During the latter half of July, 1930, the writer went to
Marfa, Texas, for the purpose of examining a number of caves which
had been reported to the Bureau of American Ethnology from that
region. Through the kindness of Mr. L. F. Curl of the Department
of Agriculture, it was possible to visit all of the more promising locali-
ties within a radius of 30 miles from Marfa. Several caves containing
pictographs were examined in the vicinity of Limpia Canyon north
of Marfa, and on the Knight ranch 18 miles southwest of Valentine
a number of very interesting caves were examined and selected as sites
for excavation in the near future.

Leaving Texas the writer proceeded to Deeth, Nevada, where in
company with Mr. William Murdock a number of caves and archeo-
logical sites were examined in the territory lying between the Ruby
and Jarbidge Mountains. On the west side of Marys River, about 10
miles north of Deeth, a low flat-topped hill about 75 yards wide and
200 yards long rises from the sagebrush plain. It is capped by a con-
glomerate rock which has been undercut by the river so as to form
a number of rock shelters, most of which are now almost entirely
filled with débris. Most of these are smoke-blackened and show abun-
dant evidences of habitation. About 10 yards below the largest of the
shelters is a large flowing spring. A test pit dug in the floor of this
cave revealed fragments of badly decayed matting, burned bones,
flint and obsidian rejects. The flat top of the hill is littered with arrow-
heads, flint implements and rejects.

Several miles northwest of this site in the midst of a large bowl
of barren desert hills stands a giant geyser cone about 300 feet in
diameter. The Ute Indians of the region have the tradition that in the
old days captives were disposed of by throwing them down the crater
of this cone into the boiling water which still fills the throat of the
cave. The geyser is no longer active as the water has broken through
at the base, where a large hot spring now flows.

Northward from this point the watershed between the Snake River
and the Humbolt is crossed. Here on the headwaters of the Bruneau
River several caves were visited. In the vicinity of Coyote Lakes a
very interesting outcrop of white opal was discovered. This had been
intensively quarried by the Indians. Most of the implements dis-
covered for many miles around appear to have been made of material
from this quarry or from obsidian obtained from the lava beds farther
to the north. The entire region, which is well watered and abundantly
supplied with game, made an ideal environment for the Indian, except-
ing for the one drawback of a very severe winter climate.
