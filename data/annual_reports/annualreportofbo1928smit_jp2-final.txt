OF THE

. SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN
INSTITUTION

C. G. ABBOT
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1928

Vo the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith my report show-
ing the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution and
the Government bureaus under its administrative charge during the
fiscal year ended June 30,1928. The first 28 pages contain a summary
account of the affairs of the Institution. Appendixes 1 to 10 give
more detailed reports of the operations of the United States National
Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the Freer Gallery of Art, the
Bureau of American Ethnology, the International Exchanges, the
National Zoological Park, the Astrophysical Observatory, the United
States Regional Bureau of the International Catalogue of Scientific
Literature, the Smithsonian library, and of the publications issued
under the direction of the Institution; and Appendix 11 contains a
list of subscribers up to October 15, 1928, to the James Smithson
Memorial Edition of the Smithsonian Scientific Series.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of Eng-
land, who, in 1826, bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
Inowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting
the trust, Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and therefore con-
stituted an “ establishment ” whose statutory members are “ the Presi-
dent, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the
executive departments.”

1
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928
THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The affairs of the Institution are administered by a Board of
Regents whose membership consists of “the Vice President, the
Chief Justice, three Members of the Senate, and three Members of
the House of Representatives, together with six other persons other
than Members of Congress, two of whom shall be resident in the
city of Washington, and the other four shall be inhabitants of some,
State, but no two of them of the same State.” One of the Regents is
elected chancellor by the board; in the past the selection has fallen
upon the Vice President or the Chief Justice; and a suitable person
is chosen by the Regents as Secretary of the Institution, who is also
secretary of the Board of Regents, and the executive officer directly
in charge of the Institution’s activities.

The following changes occurred in the personnel of the board dur-
ing the year: Senator Woodbridge N. Ferris died on March 23, 1928,
and Senator Claude A. Swanson was appointed to succeed him on
March 28, 1928. The board also lost by death the Hon. Henry White
and Mr. Charles F. Choate, jr., and their places were filled by the
appointment of the Hon. Charles Evans Hughes on December 21,
1927, and Dr. John C. Merriam on December 21, 1927.

The roll of the Regents at the close of the fiscal year was as fol-
lows: William H. Taft, Chief Justice of the United States, chan-
cellor; Charles G. Dawes, Vice President'of the United States; mem-
bers from the Senate, Reed Smoot, Joseph T. Robinson, Claude A.
Swanson; members from the House of Representatives, Albert John-
son, R. Walton Moore, Walter H. Newton; citizen members, Robert
S. Br ookings, eeu Irwin B. Deer Pennsylvania; Frederic
A. Deiano, Washington, D. C.; Dwight W. Morrow, New Jersey ;
Charles Evans Hughes, New York: and John C. Merriam, Wash-
ington, D. C.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

Elected on January 10, 1928, to be Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution, it became my duty to study the nature of the Institution,
its sources of strength, and the most effective ways in which it may
advance the mission of its founder, James Smithson, “ for the increase
and diffusion of knowledge among men.”

To the casual observer it may appear that the most important func-
tion of the Smithsonian is the administration of the public Museum,
art galleries, and Zoological Park confided to its direction. In these
days of easy travel the number of those who walk through the Na-
tional Museum, the Freer Gallery, and the Zoological Park reaches
several i eo each year. The educational value is great, though
doubtless the influence exercised on the minds of many visitors is
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 3

rather of the nature of the agreeable spending of a few hours. It
would be interesting to determine the geographical dispersion of the
benefits from these exhibition features of the Smithsonian. Almost
certainly, however, it would be found that chiefly the District of
Columbia, Maryland, and Virginia, after them the Eastern States,
and then, with rapidly growing sparseness of distribution, the mere
distant States and foreign countries partake of these benefits.
Contrast with this comparatively local influence the wider reach
of the International Exchange Service, as associated with the pub?i-
cations of the Institution. Its first Secretary, Joseph Henry, per-
ceiving the isolation of science in the America of 1850, created, as
one of the first Smithsonian activities, a system of exchange of its
publications, receiving in return those of the learned institutions of
the Old World. Having established at strategic points in other coun-
tries many agencies for such exchange, he offered the use of the sys-
tem freely to the learned institutions of the United States. Along
with this new departure he also inaugurated that of the free distri-
bution of numerous copies of Smithsonian publications to selected
libraries all over this country and the world. From such exchanges
came to the Institution that still-continuing steady stream of foreign
and domestic scientific literature which largely makes up the Smith-
sonian deposit of some half million volumes in the Library of Con-
gress, and the eight extensive libraries retained in the Institution
itself. This Government, and foreign governments as well, have
appreciated the merit of this world-wide interchange of ideas which
Secretary Henry inaugurated, and by treaty have built on the Smith-
sonian’s foundation the present International Exchange System.
Here, then, is a permanent and world-wide activity, originally
Smithsonian, promoting international good will at the same time that
it gives a powerful stimulus to the promotion of science and to the
initiation of good intellectual activities, wherever instituted. As
evidences of its effectiveness for good will, let me only say that owing
to it one finds the golden torch symbolic of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion shown with pride on the shelves of libraries all over the world;
that it was through the exchanges that Belgian libraries recovered
many sets of American and other publications after the Great War;
and that Japanese libraries were rehabilitated after the disastrous
earthquake.
In the west hall of the Smithsonian Building the visitor sees a
column of books four square, 23 feet high, with this legend:
Smithsonian Institution publications only. No duplicates. One thousand
five hundred copies of each distributed world-wide free.

In the last 50 years scarcely one scientific textbook has appeared which does
not owe something to these publications.

1See report on p. 85.
4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

They include not only technical descriptions of original research
of specialists in many lines, but also timely, readable, yet authoritative
accounts of many of the principal scientific developments of our
time.

Not less world-wide in distribution and value than its activities
for its diffusion are the Smithsonian’s accomplishments for the
increase of knowledge. In consideration of our present status let
me draw attention to several unique advantages which render the
Institution responsible for the cultivation of research. The Na-
tional Museum, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Freer collec-
tions, and, to a lesser extent, the Zoological Park, contain much of
the basis on which research in natural history and ethnology must
forever depend. What the public sees in the National Museum is not
a tithe of its national wealth. The study collections which crowd
the laboratories and corridors of the Natural History Building and
Smithsonian Building represent the fauna, flora, geology, paleontol-
ogy, and ethnology of our country and other regions. They contain
thousands of type specimens, to which the scientific world looks as
standards. They include thousands of series exhibiting the modi-
fying influences of environment. They contain specimens which
were collected many years ago, and of which the march of progress
has now forever cut off the possibility of duplication.

Extensive researches of scientific value, and not infrequently of im-
mediate practical utility, have already been based on this material.
But one who has any conception at all of the opportunity can not
but be impressed with Smithsonian responsibility. Not only must
the task of collecting and preserving specimens of the fauna, flora,
ethnological, and paleontological material at present available be dili-
gently pushed forward, lest they be forever lost, but the intensive
study of the collections must also be a major task, lest the lessons
they might teach should be lost to our generation.

Joseph Henry was not only one of America’s foremost men of
vision and of action, but a great physicist. In his time the physical
sciences, physics, chemistry, mathematics, astronomy, meteorology
were ardently cultivated by the Smithsonian. Yet for many years
past the Institution’s principal contribution to research in such lines
has been in its administration of the Astrophysical Observatory.
There has been trained there a corps of investigators whose expert
knowledge of the conditions governing the flow of radiation and of
heat is a valuable asset, and a large collection of special apparatus les
in their care. During the years that they have devoted to studies of
solar and terrestrial radiation there has at length developed a public
demand for progress in our knowledge of the relations of radiation
to climate, to the growth of plants, and to the health of human
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 5

beings. I feel that to march resolutely into these fields of investiga-
tion, which involve not only physics but chemistry, mathematics,
meteorology, and astronomy, is a policy dictated to the Smithsonian
not only by its possession of these assets of experience and apparatus
but by the traditions of its early history, by the interests of its
founder, James Smithson, who was a research chemist, and by a
proper appreciation of the salutary influence which such a rounding
out of the scope of Smithsonian researches would exercise on studies
in the other lines associated with the national collections.

Thus I am led to feel that the care of the public exhibits, educa-
tional and interesting though they are, after all is not the greatest
duty of the Smithsonian Institution. I see in the collection of new
specimens which the passage of a few more years might prevent for-
ever; in the study of existing national collections to unlock the treas-
ures of knowledge which they certainly contain; in the promotion of
researches growing out of our expert experience in the field of radia-
tion; in the publication of knowledge in both technical and popular
forms; and in the wide diffusion of knowledge through exchanges and
correspondence in all these lines, avtivities entirely suited to the
genius and situation of the Smithsonian, which in their world-wide
application and future promise, outrank in value the more local in-
fluence of the public exhibitions.

Only one thing is lacking to promote these researches. We have
the foundation equipment, we have the trained experts, but we lack
adequate means. The Government appropriations are mainly de-
voted, according to the terms of law, to expenditures incident to the
preservation of collections. But a small proportion of these annual
congressional appropriations is available to be expended on collect-
- Ing specimens or on researches. An exception occurs, it is true, in
the Bureau of American Ethnology and the Astrophysical Observa-
tory, where research is supported by Government. For research in
far eastern lands, the Freer bequest is available, but, agreeable to the
donor’s wishes, only in a restricted sense. Also the Roebling and
Canfield foundations have made possible a certain amount of collect-
ing in the field of mineralogy.

Aside from these and certain other lesser financial resources for
specified purposes, there remains the annual income of the Smith-
sonian endowment, which at present yields about $65,000 annually,
and such temporary grants for special researches as interested
friends from time to time place in the hands of the Institution.
Secretaries Henry, Baird, Langley, and Walcott all deplored the
disparity between Smithsonian endowment and Smithsonian oppor-
tunity, but until recently the outlook for increased support has been

24034—29 2

6 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

discouraging. Nor is it very adequate even yet. However, I note
with satisfaction the following items of gain or promise.

1. Gifts to the unrestricted endowment from donors mentioned last

We hope to enlist the interest of other donors to build up the unre-
stricted endowment of the Smithsonian to such an extent as to yield
an assured annual income of not less than $500,000.

While it has not been possible under existing financial circum-
stances to push strongly into the fields of research and publication
which I have indicated above, gratifying progress has been made
with the means we have. A fuller account of the researches will
appear from place to place below, but I note among indications of
progress the following:

1. To make space for laboratories and offices associated with the
work proposed in radiation and its applications to plant growth and
human health, improvements planned to include an elevator, lighting,
heating, and finishing, at the estimated expense of $15,000, will make
available eight rooms, each of nearly 200 square feet, in the flag tower
of the Smithsonian Building, which hitherto, being inaccessible to
humans, has been occupied mainly by owls, bats, and pigeons.

2. In cooperation with the New York Commission on Ventilation,
Mr. Aldrich, of the Astrophysical Observatory, bas done a novel,
interesting, and successful research on the cooling of the human body
by radiation and convection.

3. In cooperation with the Fixed Nitrogen Laboratory, research
has been started on relations of radiation to plant growth and on
the measurement of certain ultra-violet rays.

4. Among 30 expeditions relating to the natural-history sciences,
and reported upon in later pages by the chiefs of the National
Museum, the Bureau of American Ethnology, and the Freer Gallery,
an important group relates to the archeology, the fauna, the flora,
and the paleontology of the West Indian Archipelago. This group
of islands, so near our continent, yet separated from it for several
geological epochs, is of interest as illustrating the cumulative influence
on life of moderate changes of environment continued over a long
period of time. Other newly worked and interesting fields of recent
Smithsonian exploration lie as far apart as Alaska, Mexico, South

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

During the past year the Smithsonian conducted 30 expeditions,
a few of them financed solely from the meager funds of the Institu-
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

tion itself, but the majority made possible through the generosity of
friends of the Institution or through arrangements with other
agencies equally interested in the advancing of knowledge.

Besides 18 States of the United States, Smithsonian parties worked
in Alaska, the Canadian Rockies, Labrador, Mexico, Colombia,
Chile, Argentina, Brazil, the West Indies, including Hispaniola,
Cuba, and Jamaica, several countries in Europe, South West Africa,
Formosa, Sumatra, Siam, and China. The branches of the Institu-
tion interested in field exploration are the National Museum, the
Bureau of American Ethnology, the Astrophysical Observatory, and
the Freer Gallery of Art. Many of the expeditions are described in
the reports of these bureaus, which form appendixes to this report,
or in the Smithsonian Exploration Pamphlet, published annually.

SMITHSONIAN SCIENTIFIC SERIES

During the year a definite agreement became effective with the
Smithsonian Institution Series (Inc.), of New York, to publish and
distribute a series of 12 books, to be known as the Smithsonian Scien-
tific Series, under the editorship of the Secretary. The books are
intended to present an interesting picture of many of the scientific
activities of the Institution and its branches, and are to be written
in popular style, profusely illustrated. The first four volumes are
expected to appear in the autumn of 1928 and the other eight will
follow in two groups of four at intervals of several months.

The first four books were in proof at the close of the fiscal year and
the others were in various stages of preparation. The titles of the
first four books are as follows:

1. The Smithsonian Institution, by W. P. True.

2. The Sun and the Welfare of Man, by C. G. Abbot.

3. Minerals from Earth and Sky, by G. P. Merrill and W. F.
Foshag.

4, North American Indians, compiled from the source material of
the Bureau of American Ethnology by R. A. Palmer.

Two motives prompted the Institution to undertake the publica-
tion of this series: First, the desire to promote the diffusion of
knowledge, and second, the desire to add to its insufficient resources
for research and publication. It is hoped that the royalties accruing
to the Institution from the sale of these books will continue over
a long period and will contribute substantially to its available
resources for scientific work.

The list of subscribers to the James Smithson Memorial Edition
will be found* in Appendix 11.

the printer.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY ig |
RESEARCH CORPORATION

The Research Corporation of New York, for the administration of
inventions and new industrial processes in the public interest, was
founded in 1912 through the gift by Dr. Frederick G. Cottrell and
his associates of valuable patents covering processes for the electrical
precipitation of dust, smoke, and chemical fumes. The net profits
from the commercial application of the patents are used to aid and
encourage technical and scientific research. The Smithsonian has
always been in close relationship to the Research Corporation, the
late Secretary Charles D. Walcott having served as a director since
its inception, and this year the present Secretary was elected to
membership on the board of directors.

In February, 1928, the directors of the corporation having ex-
pressed an interest in the solar radiation research program of the
Institution, a statement of the proposed work was given them, with
the result that in March a grant of $15,000 was made to the Institu-
tion to promote investigations on the relation of radiation to the
growth of plants, the effects of radiation on the health and growth of
animals and human beings, and the dependence of world weather on
solar radiation.

COOPERATIVE ETHNOLOGICAL AND ARCHEOLOGICAL INVESTIGA-
TIONS BETWEEN THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION AND STATE,
EDUCATIONAL, AND SCIENTIFIC INSTITUTIONS

At the past session of the Congress, the following act authorizing
cooperation in ethnological and archeological investigations was

enacted:
[Publiec, No. 248, Seventieth Congress]

Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United
States of America in Congress assembled, That the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution is hereby authorized to cooperate with any State, educational In-
stitution, or scientific organization in the United States for continuing eth-
nological researches among the American Indians and the excavation and pres-
ervation of archeological remains.

Sec. 2. That there is hereby authorized to be appropriated, out of any money
in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, the sum of $20,000, which shall be
available until expended for the above purposes: Provided, That at such time
as the Smithsonian Institution is satisfied that any State, educational institu-
tion, or scientific organization in any of the United States is prepared to
contribute to such investigation and when in its judgment such investigation
shall appear meritorious, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution may
direct that an amount from this sum equal to that contributed by such State,
educational institution or scientific organization, not to exceed $2,000, to be
expended from such sum in any one State during any calendar year, be made
available for cooperative investigation: Provided further, That all such coopera-
tive work and division of the result thereof shall be under the direction of the
Seeretary of the Smithsonian Institution: Provided further, That where lands
.

iP 4 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

are involved which are under the jurisdiction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs
or the National Park Service, cooperative work thereon shall be under such
regulations and conditions as the Secretary of the Interior may provide.

Approved, April 10, 1928.

The appropriation of $20,000 authorized by the above act was
made in the deficiency act, approved May 29, 1928. The following
regulations for the carrying out of the project were promulgated by
the Institution:

1. From the above appropriation, the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution
may approve expenditure of a sum equal to that provided by any State or
educational or scientific organization, not exceeding $2,000 in any one State
in any one year, when satisfied that such State or organization is prepared to
contribute to such investigation, and when in his judgment cooperation by the
Institution in such investigation is justified.

A. Requests for cooperation should be made by the responsible officer of the
State, educational institution, or scientific organization interested.

B. Applications should be accompanied by full explanatory statements of the
work proposed, the location, purpose, and any other pertinent details, the
name of the field representative, if any, of the applicant, and should state
whether any supervisory salaries are to be paid from that portion of the joint
fund provided by the applicant; and if so, the amount thereof. It is intended
that all funds provided for such cooperative work shall be devoted strictly to
the prosecution of definite projects contemplated by the act and shall not be
used for the payment of regular salaries or other regular expenses of any
organization.

C. Applicants must present Suitable evidence of the availability of funds for
cooperative use and will present at regular intervals detailed accounts of
expenditures therefrom. Full instructions will be furnished regarding expendi-
tures from allotments by the Institution, which must be made to conform with
the accounting regulations of the United States Treasury Department.

D. A report covering each cooperative investigation, including copies of all
maps, charts, photographs, or other notes relating to the work shall be filed
with the Smithsonian Institution by the leader of the joint investigation within
a reasonable period following its completion. It is contemplated that a proper
report embodying the results obtained will be prepared for publication by the
leader or his agent within a reasonable time.

2. The act provides that “all such cooperative work and division of the
result thereof shall be under the direction of the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution.” The leader of any joint investigation must be approved or desig-
nated by the Secretary, who may at any time, if in his judgment it be desirable,
send a representative to the scene of operations to inspect the work, at the
expense of the allotment made for the particular investigation concerned.

8. Any cooperative investigation involving lands under the jurisdiction of the
Departments of the Interior, or of Agriculture, will be subject to such rules as
the secretary of the department having jurisdiction may impose.

In accordance with the terms of the act cited above, an allotment
of $500 was made on June 19 to Mr. P. E. Cox, State archeologist of
Tennessee, to be used in conducting an ethnological and archeological
survey of that portion of the proposed Great Smoky Mountains Park
lying within the State of Tennessee. As the work had not actually
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 13

been begun at the close of the fiscal year, it will be described in
my next report, together with such other cooperative projects as may
be undertaken during the coming year under the congressional appro-
priation for that purpose.

PRESENTATION OF THE LANGLEY MEDAL TO COL. CHARLES A. LIND-
BERGH AND THE DEPOSIT OF THE “SPIRIT OF ST. LOUIS” IN THE
NATIONAL MUSEUM

In my last report, announcement was made of the award on June
11, 1927, of the Langley medal to Col. Charles A. Lindbergh for his
nonstop flight from New York to Paris.

The actual presentation of the gold medal to Colonel Lindbergh
took place in the Smithsonian Building on December 8, 1927, at the
annual meeting of the Board of Regents. In presenting the medal
Chief Justice Taft, chancellor of the Institution, said in part:

Colonel LINDBERGH :

The Langley medal was established in memory of the third secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution, Samuel Pierpont Langley. During the last 15 years
of his life Doctor Langley’s primary interest was in making possible man’s
flight. In this research he conducted active experiments in the lift and drift
of planes, and the properties of curved surfaces, constructed large steam-driven
models as early as 1896, which flew long distances, and finally he attempted to
construct a man-carrying machine, which was wrecked in the two trials which
it had during his lifetime. * * * Following the advice of an eminent com-
mittee of award, the medal is now presented to you, sir, in recognition of your
daring nonstop flight from New York to Paris of May 20 and 21, 1927. I have
the honor and pleasure of presenting the medal to you on behalf of the Regents
of the Smithsonian Institution.

Permit me to add that the whole bearing and tendency of your life prior to,
during, and since your memorable flight, as the light of publicity is more and
more thrown upon it, has greatly enhanced the pleasure which my colleagues
and I take in presenting you this award. May your future work go far to
establish the dream of your desire, the wide and useful promotion of the sub-
ject of commercial aviation.

In accepting the medal, Colonel Lindbergh said:

First, I want to express my appreciation of this honor which you have just
given me, and also to thank you as the board of the Smithsonian Institution for
the interest you have taken in aeronautics. At a conference in St. Louis among
those interested in these fields it was decided that when the Spirit of St. Lowis
was taken from service it would be offered to the Smithsonian Institution for
permanent exhibition here.

The Spirit of St. Louis was piloted on its last flight from St. Louis
to Washington by Colonel Lindbergh on April 30, 1928, and turned
over to the Institution. It was placed on public exhibition in the Arts
and Industries Building of the National Museum on May 13, 1928,
where it faces the main entrance in a pose strongly suggesting actual
flight, and immediately became the mecca for thousands of visitors
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

daily. It promises to be for a long time to come the most popular
exhibit in the whole National Museum, and the thanks of the Nation
are due Colonel Lindbergh and his friends in St. Louis for placing
the famous plane in the national collection.

WALCOTT MEMORIAL MEETING

In accordance with resolutions adopted by the Board of Regents on
the day following the death of Charles Doolittle Walcott, Secretary
of the Institution from 1907 to 1927, a memorial meeting was held on
January 24, 1928, in the auditorium of the National Museum, which
was attended by a large number of Doctor Walcott’s friends and
official associates. Chief Justice William H. Taft, chancellor of the
Institution, presided. In his introductory remarks he reviewed very
briefly the many-sided career of Doctor Walcott in scientific research
and in public service, and concluded by saying that the meeting was
being held “in memory of a man whose work promoted real scientific
investigation and discovery in his particular field, who was a shining
example of a Government civil servant of the highest ideals and suc-
cess, and who for 20 years gave greatly of his energies and the
hardest kind of labor to expanding the usefulness of the Smithsonian
Institution.”

The first speaker was Dr. John C. Merriam, president of the
Carnegie Institution of Washington, who considered Doctor Walcott’s
scientific work, emphasizing particularly his contributions to the
study of the early life of the earth, as to the structure of ancient ani-
mals, their biological classification, their faunal grouping, or their
succession in time. “ In all these aspects of the problem,” said Doctor
Merriam, “ his accomplishments belong to the first rank of the world’s
researches.” He spoke also of Doctor Walcott’s continuous service to
the Carnegie Institution from the time of its organization until his
death. He was one of the original incorporators and a member of
the first board of trustees, and contributed largely to the accomplish-
ments of the Carnegie Institution during the 25 years of his asso-
ciation with it.

Dr. Joseph S. Ames, professor of physics at Johns Hopkins Univer-
sity and chairman of the National Advisory Committee for Aero-
nautics, spoke of Doctor Walcott’s relations with that committee.
With the coming of the World War Doctor Walcott was one of the
few who realized the importance of a national survey and study of
aeronautics, and it was he who secured the passage of an act estab-
lishing the National Advisory Committee. His relations with it
were summed up by Doctor Ames thus: “ He created it; he planned
its duties wisely; he guided and inspired it; he secured the appro-
priations for its support. Each year he took more interest and price
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

in its operation. ‘There can be no doubt that from all this he himself
received his reward of pleasure and satisfaction.”

Doctor Walcott’s service to the United States Geological Survey
was presented by Dr. George Otis Smith, director of the survey.
Here was shown Walcott’s exceptional capacity for the dual duties
of research and administration, and during the 13 years of his direc-
torship the Geological Survey had its greatest growth. He found
time also at this period to sponsor the development of reclamation
projects, national forests, national parks, fuel-testing plants, and
mine-safety stations. “Charles Walcott was great as the scientist,
famed the world over; he was great as the public official, honored the
length and breadth of his own country; he was also great as the
man in his home, among his friends in this community.”

Dr. Charles G. Abbot, present Secretary of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, spoke in conclusion of “ Doctor Walcott, the Smithsonian
Secretary and National Academy President.” His successful meth-
ods of administration of the Institution were touched upon, and his
long service to the National Academy outlined. In closing Doctor
Abbot said that “the Smithsonian Institution may well be proud
of its fourth secretary and the National Academy of its ninth
president.”

The full proceedings of the Walcott memorial meeting were printed
in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, the pamphlet including
a complete bibliography of Doctor Walcott’s published writings,
numbering 272 titles.

PRESENTATION OF PORTRAIT OF THE SECRETARY

Mrs. Samantha L. Huntley presented to the Institution a portrait
of Dr. C. G. Abbot, fifth secretary. In offering the portrait, Mrs.
Huntley wrote:

It has given me much pleasure to paint this portrait, and I hope you will

accept it for the Institution with my sincere wishes for your success in the
administration of its affairs.

The portrait is at present hung in the National Gallery of Art.

PUBLICATIONS

The four series issued by the Institution proper are the Smith-
sonian Annual Reports, the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowl-
edge, the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, and Smithsonian
Special Publications, while other series are published by several of
the bureaus under the direction of the Institution, including the
National Museum, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the Astro-
physical Observatory, and the National Gallery of Art. Copies of
all of these publications are distributed free to a large list of libraries.
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

learned societies, and specialists throughout the world, and certain of
the less technical publications, such as the Smithsonian Reports and .
Smithsonian exploration pamphlets, are widely distributed among
the general public.

In the General Appendix to the Smithsonian Report of each year
are included 25 to 30 articles selected from the periodical literature
of the world to show advances and interesting features of all branches
of science.

During the past year the Institution published 117 volumes and
pamphlets, of which there were distributed altogether 183,196 copies,
including 29,720 volumes and separates of the Smithsonian Annual
Reports, 26,099 volumes and separates of the Smithsonian Miscel-
laneous Collections, 5,878 Smithsonian Special Publications, 111,405
publications of the National Museum, and 9,126 publications of the
Bureau of American Ethnology. The titles of the papers, number
of pages, and other bibliographical information are given in the
report of the editor of the Institution, Appendix 10.

The following sentence occurs in a letter received by the editor
from the chief of the Smithsonian Division in the Library of
Congress:

The Smithsonian Report is one of the most constantly called-for publications
we have here in the Library of Congress.

The annual pamphlet issued by the Institution describing the
year’s explorations and field work covered 30 expeditions to all parts
of the world and was illustrated with 213 photographs taken by the
Smithsonian field workers. An innovation in the latest pamphlet, in
the desire to make it more attractive to the general reader, was to
present the accounts in the form of short separate articles, written in
the first person and each signed by the author, instead of as im-
personal reports as heretofore.

Allotments for printing—The congressional allotments for the
printing of the Smithsonian Report to Congress and the various
publications of the Government bureaus under the administration of
the Institution were virtually used up at the close of the year. The
appropriation for the coming year ending June 380, 1929, totals
$95,000, allotted as follows:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 17

Committee on printing and publications—AlIl manuscripts sub-
mitted to the Institution for publication either by members of the
staff or by outside authors are referred for consideration and recom-
mendation to the Smithsonian advisory committee on printing and
publication. The committee also considers matters of publication
policy. During the past year seven meetings were held and 107 manu-
scripts were considered and acted upon. The membership at the close
of the year was as follows: Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, head curator of
biology, National Museum, chairman; Dr. George P. Merrill, head
curator of geology, National Museum; Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, Bureau
of American Ethnology; Dr. William M. Mann, director, National
Zoological Park; Mr. W. P. True, editor of the Institution, secretary ;
Dr. Marcus Benjamin, editor of the National Museum; and Mr.
Stanley Searles, editor of the Bureau of American Ethnology.

LIBRARY

The Smithsonian library comprises the Smithsonian deposit
in the Library of Congress, which is the main brary of the Insti-
tution, 8 divisional libraries relating to the work of the bureaus
under the Institution, and 36 sectional libraries maintained for use in
individual offices. The accessions for the year, exclusive of those
of the Bureau of American Ethnology, were 6,838 volumes and
16,203 pamphlets and charts, a total of 23,041 items. This brings the
estimated total of volumes, pamphlets, and charts in the Smithsonian
library to 709,584, not including the library of the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology, at present administered separately by the chief of
that bureau, or the thousands of volumes awaiting completion or as
yet uncatalogued.

The staff was augmented by provision for a second position of
assistant librarian to act as chief of the accessions department—the
department which acquires publications for the library, partly by
purchase and gift, but mainly by exchange.

The two most noteworthy gifts for the year were the Chinese
library of the late William W. Rockhill, consisting of 1,100 volumes,
presented by Mrs. Rockhill, and a collection of 3,500 serial and
society publications presented by the American Association for the
Advancement of Science. A large number of the latter, including
some that were out of print and very rare, were needed to complete
sets in the various libraries of the Institution.

As usual many volumes and parts of volumes wanted for the
Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress were obtained, and
with the reorganization of the accessions department it is expected
that this service will soon be greatly enlarged. Notable progress
was made on the union catalogue of the Smithsonian library, espe-
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

cially in connection with the Smithsonian deposit, the office library,
the Langley aeronautical library, and the libraries of the National
Museum and the Astrophysical Observatory. The technological
library was reorganized, and the reference room was greatly improved
and made more attractive.

A number of special activities were undertaken during the year,
including the sorting and distribution of a large accumulation of
reprints; the making of a list, preparatory to cataloguing, of some
of the special collections, including the Casey, Dall, Gill, Henderson,
Lacoe, Roebling, Schaus, Springer, Teller, and Vaux; and work on
the reorganization of the west stacks in the Smithsonian Building.

NATIONAL MUSEUM

The appropriations for the maintenance of the National Museum
totaled $650,960, an increase of $41,640 over the preceding year. A
large part of the increase was for the purpose of providing for a
much-needed one-rate promotion for the staff, leaving a small sum
available for purchase of specimens and certain other necessary mat-
ters. A special appropriation of $12,500 permitted the construction
of a gallery in the National Herbarium, which was completed during
the year, nearly doubling the available space for plants.

The two most important needs of the Museum to enable it to func-
tion efficiently and expand normally are for additional personnel
and more adequate housing. There are several groups of collections
with no specialist in charge, and in a number of divisions there are
no assistants in training to carry on the work when the older men are
gone. The two buildings of the Museum are filled to overflowing,
both in the exhibition halls and in the study rooms. The older struc-
ture, built in 1881, is antiquated and should be replaced by a larger
and more modern one, and the newer Natural History Building
should be enlarged by the addition of two wings, as originally planned
for by the architect.

Additions to the collections during the year reached the total of
832,912 objects, more than twice the number received during the
previous year. Specimens given to schools numbered 6,267, and
more than 25,000 specimens were loaned to specialists for study. I
will mention here only a few of the outstanding accessions, and others
will be found listed in the report of the assistant secretary, Ap-
pendix 1.

In the department of anthropology there was received an excellent
series of ivory, bone, stone, pottery, and wooden objects representative
of the Eskimo culture of Nunivak Island, Alaska, collected by Messrs.
Collins and Stewart, of the Museum staff; a series of objects collected
by the Bureau of American Ethnology from a basket-maker village
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 19

site in New Mexico; and a collection of stone graters, pestles, celts,
and clay figurines collected by Assistant Secretary Wetmore in the
mountains of the Dominican Republic. In the same Republic Mr.
H. W. Krieger, working under the auspices of Dr. W. L. Abbott,
collected an excellent series of bone and stone implements and
potsherds near Samana Bay.

The department of biology received the large majority of the year’s
accessions, the total for the department being 680,350 specimens.
This great number is accounted for largely by the receipt of several
extensive private collections, among them the C. F. Baker collection
of insects of the Philippines and the East Indies generally, be-
queathed to the Museum by the late Doctor Baker; the C. G. Lloyd
mycological collection of 75,000 specimens of the larger fungi; the
Charles W. Hargitt collection of hydroids; and the George M. Greene
collection of Coleoptera. Important collections of natural history
material came from Dr. Hugh M. Smith, in Siam, and from Mr.
A. de C. Sowerby, working under the auspices of Col. R. S. Clark,
in China. Mr. W. L. Brown, of the taxidermy staff, joined an expe-
dition to the Sudan and brought back a valuable set of mammals,
birds, and fishes. Important collections from Hispaniola came to
the Museum through the work there of Assistant Secretary Wetmore,
Dr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., and Mr. A. J. Poole. Accessions to the
division of plants included 9,000 specimens collected in Honduras by
Mr. Paul C. Standley and 3,000 from Formosa and Sumatra, col-
lected by Prof. H. H. Bartlett through cooperation of the Museum
and the University of Michigan.

In geology many rare and important minerals were acquired under
the Roebling fund established last year. Several beautiful gems and
minerals were obtained through the Chamberlain fund, including a
65-carat cut gem of alexandrite; and the Isaac Lea collection received
an unusual series of cut stones of sphene given by Miss Nina Lea,
granddaughter of the founder of the collection. Dr. W. F. Foshag, of
the Museum staff, collected a striking group of gypsum crystals and
sets of valuable ores in Mexico. The Frank Springer collection of
fossil echinoderms, a complete library on this subject, and a fund
to promote work in connection with the collection came to the
Museum through the bequest of the late Doctor Springer. In ver-
tebrate paleontology there were acquired a skeleton of the extinct
lizard Clidastes, one of the rare three-toed horses from the Miocene
of Wyoming, and a further series of fossil footprints collected by
Mr. C. W. Gilmore.

The outstanding accession in the arts and industries department
and the object of greatest popular interest to be received by the
Museum in many years is Colonel Lindbergh’s Spirit of St. Louis.
Other interesting accessions in this department include the Pan
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

American good-will flyer San Francisco, a White-Stanhope steam
automobile of 1901-2, a collection of ancient and modern watch and
clock movements presented by the New Haven Clock Co., an auto-
matic gingham loom of the latest type presented by the Crompton
& Knowles loom works, and the apparatus used in receiving the first
photoradiogram across the Atlantic on November 27, 1924, when a
picture of President Coolidge was sent from London and received in
New York City in the office of the Radio Corporation of America,
by whom this apparatus was deposited in the Museum. The division
of history received an interesting series of relics of Rear Admiral
Charles D. Sigsbee, given by Mrs. Nellie C. Gunther, and a number
of ancient Roman and modern European and oriental coins deposited
by the Treasury Department.

The Museum took part during the year in numerous field expedi-
tions in this country and abroad, through which large and important
collections were brought back for study and exhibition. A brief
account of these will be found in the report on the Museum appended
hereto. The auditorium and lecture rooms of the Museum were
used for 115 meetings of governmental agencies, scientific bodies,
and other associations and societies. The number of visitors to the
Museum totaled 1,413,286 for the year, an increase of 260,000 over
the previous year. There were published 10 volumes and 59 separate
papers, and 111,405 copies of Museum publications were distributed.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

The need of an adequate National Gallery building is more urgent
than ever. Present quarters occupied by the gallery in the Natural
History Building of the National Museum are grossly inadequate
and are much needed by the Museum.

At the seventh annual meeting of the National Gallery of Art
Commission, a resolution was adopted favoring the assemblage at
some future date of the purchases made from the Henry Ward
Ranger fund since its establishment, now numbering nearly 70, in
order to enable the commission to make a selection of such works as
the gallery desires to claim.

Lists of the art works offered to the gallery during the year and
accepted by the commission and of the accessions to the gallery col-
lections during the year, subject to the approval of the advisory
committee of the commission, will be found in Appendix 2.

Four special exhibits were held in the gallery during the year:
A collection of portraits by Bernard Osterman; the annual exhibit
of the Society of Washington Artists; a collection of paintings by
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Zt

contemporary British artists; and the annual exhibition of the Wash-
ington Water Color Club. Among the withdrawals of loans to the
gallery should be mentioned 20 old masters lent by Mrs. Ralph Cross
Johnson in 1924, 14 paintings by British and Dutch masters lent by
Henry Cleveland Perkins, Esq., in 1922, and the John H. McFadden
collection of 48 British masters temporarily placed in the gallery
in 1922.

Accessions to the gallery library numbered 1,096 volumes, pam-
phlets and periodicals, and 12 water-color paintings by Doctor
Holmes, the gift of the artist. .

FREER GALLERY OF ART

Additions to the collections in the Freer Gallery during the year
include two pieces of Persian pottery, three of Chinese porcelain, and
six Persian paintings dating from the thirteenth to the seventeenth
century. The most important addition to the library was the Chinese
hbrary of the late William Woodville Rockhill, comprising 1,100
volumes.

Two hundred and twenty-four objects were submitted for expert
opinion or for translation of their oriental inscriptions, and 34 trans-
lations were made of inscriptions from photographs submitted to the
curator. In answer to a constantly increasing demand, there are now
available for purchase 1,491 photographs of objects in the gallery in
addition to 829 negatives of the Biblicai manuscripts. The gallery
sold during the year 1,089 photographs, 2,017 post cards, and 1,031
copies of gallery publications.

The total attendance for the year was 111,288; of these, 1,218 came
to the office for special information, to study the building and meth-
ods, to see objects in storage, to make drawings, or for similar pur-
poses. Thirty-three classes were given instruction, four groups were
given docent service in the galleries, and two lectures were given in
the auditorium.

The gallery’s field work in China, in charge of Mr. C. W. Bishop,
was suspended, owing in part to conditions there, and Mr. Bishop
returned to Washington temporarily, visiting en route important
archeological collections and sites in Egypt and the principal western
European countries. In Washington he has been occupied chiefly in
studying the material collected during four and a half years in China.
Dr. C. Li and Mr. K. Z. Tung, the Chinese members of the field staff,
stayed in China to maintain the contacts established there and to
prepare for future field work. Mr. Li came to Washington in the
summer of 1928 to discuss plans for future work in China.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, chief of the bureau since March 1, 1918, re-
tired on January 15, 1928, but was continued on the staff as associate
anthropologist. °

To facilitate the appointment of Doctor Fewkes’s successor as chief
of the bureau, a special unassembled examination was arranged by
the Civil Service Commission, in consultation with the Secretary, for
the purpose of establishing a list of eligibles. The ranking of appli-
cants was done by a committee comprising a representative of the com-
mission, the secretary of the Smithsonian, and Dr. A. V. Kidder, rep-
resenting ethnological and archeological science at large. As a result,
the appointment of Mr. Matthew William Stirling was made, to take
effect August 1, 1928, just after the close of the fiscal year.

The work of the staff of the bureau has included ethnological re-
searches relating to the Indians of the Southern States, the Sauk and
Fox, the Northern Arapaho, the Mission Indians of California, the
Six Nations, the Chippewa, the Winnebago, and the Osage. Arche-
ological work by Doctor Roberts in Chaco Canyon, N. Mex., and near
Arboles, Colo., uncovered interesting village sites. Cooperating with
the bureau, Messrs. Judd, Krieger, and Collins, of the National Mu-
seum, made archeological investigations in Kentucky, in the Colum-
bia Basin of Oregon and Washington, and in western Alaska. <Ac-
counts of this ethnological and archeological work appear in the re-
ports of the bureau and the Museum.

The bureau published during the year one annual report and one
bulletin, and 9,126 copies of bureau publications were distributed.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES

A total of 542,233 packages of publications were handled during the
year, including those sent abroad and those received for distribution
in this country. The total weight of this material was 584,121 pounds,
an increase of 40,996 pounds over the previous year’s total.

Burma and Bombay were added to the list of foreign depositories
that receive sets of United States official documents, bringing the total
number of such sets sent through the exchange service to 105. Ru-
mania, which, since 1903, has received a partial set, now receives a
full set. Shipments to Turkey, suspended since the World War, were
resumed, the ministry of public instruction at Angora acting as the
depository. The daily issue of the Congressional Record is now ex-
changed for the parliamentary journals of 101 foreign governmental
bodies. Brazil, the Irish Free State, and Turkey were added to the
list during the year.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 23

The Italian Office of International Exchanges, formerly under
direction of the Victor Emanuel National Library in Rome, was
placed under the ministry of public instruction. The Dutch Central
Scientific Bureau, exchange agency fox the Netherlands, is now under
the direction of the Royal Library at 'The Hague.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Although there was no important increase in the collection of ani-
mals during the year, nevertheless a number of interesting species
new to the collection was added.

The total number of animals added was 336, while 459 were lost
through death, return of animals, and exchange, leaving the collec-
tion at 2,273 individuals of 582 different species. A considerable
number of animals was born in the park, as usual. Among the more
serious losses by death were the two giraffes, Dot and Hi-boy, secured
by the Chrysler expedition, a Kadiak bear which had lived in the
Park for over 23 years, the last cheetah in the collection, a jaguar,
and an anaconda which had been at the Park for just 28 years, a
notable record of longevity for this snake.

The attendance for the year, although somewhat smaller than last
year when the animals brought back by the Smithsonian-Chrysler
African expedition attracted great crowds of visitors, was neverthe-
less higher than for any other year in the history of the park. The
total number of visitors was 2,298,449. Classes from 445 different
schools visited the park, comprising 27,959 students. A number of
scientific societies officially visited the park, including the American
Society of Mammalogists, the American Ornithologists’ Union, and
the Society of Icthyologists and Herpetologists; the Vivarium
Society held monthly meetings at the Park.

The new bird house, mentioned in last year’s report, was com-
pleted in June, 1928, and the installation of the birds was com-
menced, so that the building will be opened to the public during the
summer. The structure has been highly praised by officials of other
zoological parks and by the public. It is divided into four rooms,
together containing 145 indoor cages, and in the center is a ereat
flight cage 58 feet long, 22 feet wide, and 32 feet high, containing
rocks, a large tree, a pool, and running water.

This new bird house is a great improvement to the park, but the
director calls attention to the fact that after 20 years of earnest
appeal for more adequate buildings to house the splendid collection
of animals, the bird house is practically the only entirely satisfactory
building in the National Zoological Park, the others being a con-
tinual source of unfavorable comment by visitors. He lists seven
24 ANNUAL. REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

urgently needed structures which would cost in the neighborhood of
$1,000,000, namely: 1. Exhibition house for reptiles, amphibians,
and invertebrates. 2. Ape, lemur, and small mammal house. 3.
Pachyderm house. 4. Remodeling of the carnivore house. 5. An-
telope, buffalo, and wild cattle house. 6. A wing to be added to the
-bird house, with open air aviaries. 7. A proper fence around the
entire park.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

The three field stations of the observatory, located at Table Moun-
tain, Calif.; Montezuma, Chile; and Mount Brukkaros, South West
Africa, have continued sending to the Smithsonian results of daily
observation of the intensity of solar radiation, and the United States
Weather Bureau published the daily values from Montezuma on the
Washington weather maps.

A statistical study of the data accumulated at the Table Mountain
station led Mr. Fowle to discover a hitherto unsuspected influence of
variability in the ozone content of the atmosphere. Regular obser-
vations of ozone are now made at Table Mountain in cooperation with
Doctor Dobson, of Oxford, England.

A new research undertaken by Mr. Aldrich under a grant from the
New York Commission on Ventilation was on the proportion of loss
of heat of the normally clothed human body which should be ascribed
to radiation rather than to convection by the air. Long series of
novel and valuable experiments were made, using the melikeron, or
honeycomb pyranometer, for observing radiation of bedies at low
temperature, and a special thermoelectric temperature tester con-
structed for the research. ‘The interesting results obtained, which
are summed up in the director’s report appended hereto, will shortly
be published.

The director undertook at Mount Wilson in the fall of 1927 and
again in the summer of 1928 to continue radiometer measurements of
the distribution of energy in the spectra of the stars. In the 1927
experiments the radiometer vanes, made of bits of house-flies’ wings,
were sealed into a glass case in hydrogen, but after many trials the
apparatus proved useless because the mechanism required to rotate
the system so stirred up the gas that wholly unexpected motions re-
sulted. In 1928 an optically figured, fuzed quartz cylindrical vessel
was used, which was mounted on a brass support rotatable in a
ground joint. With this apparatus a high degree of success was
achieved, but as the results were obtained after the dag of the year
under Cpenhinnn they will be described in next year’s report.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 25

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC
LITERATURE

Since actual publication of the International Catalogue was sus-
pended in 1922, owing to the inability of the foreign bureaus to con-
tribute their quota of the necessary financial support, the United
States bureau has continued to compile the necessary records of cur-
rent scientific publications. As explained each year to Congress and
to the Bureau of the Budget, the expenditures for this purpose have
been kept at the lowest possible level.

An effort was made to inaugurate a practical plan for resuming
publication of the catalogue and the matter is still under negotiation.
It seems probable that the various countries previously represented
will again cooperate by furnishing the necessary bibliographical data
if the small capital fund needed to start the operation of the central
bureau and begin publication can be raised.

NECROLOGY

The Institution suffered the loss by death during the year
of three distinguished members of the Board of Regents—Senator
Woodbridge Nathan Ferris, Mr. Charles Francis Choate, jr., and the
Hon. Henry White. These three men, in serving for varying periods on
the board, have aided materially in advancing the work and reputa-
tion of the Institution, and their names will be added with gratitude
to the long roster of distinguished men who have so served since
1846.

Woodbridge Nathan Ferris, United States Senator from Michi-
gan, was born at Spencer, N. Y., January 6, 1853. He was principal
successively of several academies and colleges in Illinois until 1884,
when he founded the Ferris Institute, of which he thereafter served
as president. In 1913 he was elected Governor of Michigan, being
reelected in 1915. He was elected United States Senator from Michi-
gan for the term 1923 to 1929, but died on March 23, 1928, before the
completion of his term. Senator Ferris served on the Board of
Regents for three years.

Charles Francis Choate, jr., lawyer, of Boston, Mass., had at the
time of his death served on the Board of Regents for a longer period
than any other living member, having been first appointed on Feb-
ruary 24, 1908. He was born at Cambridge, Mass., on October 23,
1866, and was educated at Harvard University. He became presi-
dent.of the Appleton Co., and was a director of the New York, New
Haven & Hartford Railroad Co., the Merchants National Bank of
Boston, and the American Telephone & Telegraph Co. Mr. Choate
died on November 30, 1927, having therefore been a Regent -of the
Institution for nearly 20 years.
=

26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

Henry White, diplomat, was born at Baltimore, Md., March 29,
1850. He received the degree of LL. D. from St. Andrew’s Uni-
versity of Scotland, from Johns Hopkins University, and from Har-
vard University. He held various posts in the American diplomatic
service, and was appointed secretary of the embassy at London in
1897. This office he held until 1905, when he was made American
ambassador to Italy, and two years later ambassador to France.
He represented the United States at a number of important confer-
ences, including the Fourth Pan American Conference at Buenos
Aires in 1910, when he acted as chairman of the American delega-
tion. In 1918-19 he was a member of the American commission to
negotiate peace, at Paris. Mr. White died on July 15, 1927. He
served on the Board of Regents from January 15, 1917, until the
time of his death.

JOSEPH NELSON ROSE

Joseph Nelson Rose, associate curator of botany in the National
Museum, died at his home in Washington, May 4, 1928. Born at
Liberty, Ind., in 1862, Doctor Rose received his education at Wabash
College. In 1888 he was appointed assistant botanist in the Depart-
ment of Agriculture. When the National Herbarium was trans-
ferred from that department to the Smithsonian Institution in 1895,
Doctor Rose joined the Smithsonian’s staff and here his botanical
work was done for the rest of his life.

During his 40 years of original research Doctor Rose became a
recognized authority on certain difficult families of plants. Most of
his work was done under the Smithsonian Institution, but his well-
known investigation of the cactus family was conducted under the
auspices of the Carnegie Institution of Washington. In the course
of this investigation he traveled extensively in the western United
States, Mexico, and South America, and the results were published
in four imposing volumes by the Carnegie Institution.

The gift of the private herbarium and botanical library of Capt.
John Donnell Smith, of Baltimore, one of the most important ever
received by the Institution, was brought about largely through the
efforts of Doctor Rose. His published contributions to botanical
knowledge number over 100,

IMMANUEL MOSES CASANOWICZ

Immanuel Moses Casanowicz, assistant curator of the division of
Old World archeology in the National Museum, died September 26,
1927, at the age of 74. He was born at Zholudok, Russia, July 25,
1853, and studied at the University of Basle, Switzerland. Between
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 2

1880 and 1886 he was an instructor, first at the Evangelische Predi-
gerschule at Basle, and later at the German Theological School of
Newark at Bloomfield, N. J. In 1892 he received the degree of
Ph. D. from Johns Hopkins University, and the same year entered
the service of the National Museum, where he remained for the rest
of his life.

Doctor Casanowicz was a recognized authority in the field of Old
World archeology, specializing in the subject of comparative re-
ligions. He published several papers on the various religions of
man, and at the time of his death another was left practically com-
pleted, which would have closed the series. He was a member of the
American Oriental Society and vice president of the Anthropological
Society of Washington. Doctor Casanowicz was a man of broad
culture, and his place on the Museum staff will be difficult to fill.

FRANK SPRINGER

Frank Springer, associate in paleontology in the National Museum
and a benefactor of the Institution, died September 22, 1927. He
was born June 17, 1848, at Wapello, Iowa, and received his education
at the State University of Iowa. Admitted to the bar in 1869, he
went to New Mexico, where he soon became a leader of the bar of
that State. He was instrumental in having a law passed by Congress
establishing a tribunal for the settlement of titles under Spanish and
Mexican land grants, and his greatest professional success was at-
tained as attorney for the Maxwell Land Grant Co. He retired
from active practice in 1906, and from that time on he devoted him-
self largely to the scientific work that he loved and that has placed
him among the front rank of American paleontologists.

Doctor Springer’s connection with the Smithsonian Institution
began in 1911, when he brought his collection of fossil echinoderms
to Washington and installed it in the National Museum, where office
room and storage space for the collection were assigned him. He
spent the winter and spring months of each year at the Museum
carrying on his scientific work, and many of his papers were pub-
lished by the Museum. His well-known quarto monographs, “ The
Crinoidea Flexibilia,” “American Silurian Crinoids,” and others
were issued by the Smithsonian Institution.

By a deed of gift Doctor Springer’s valuable collection and funds
provided by him for its upkeep came to the Institution immediately
after his death.

BRADSHAW HALL SWALES

Bradshaw Hall Swales, honorary assistant curator of birds in the
National Museum, died January 23, 1928, at his home in Washington.
Mr. Swales was born in Detroit, Mich., June 30, 1875, and graduated

? ? ? p] >
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

from the University of Michigan in 1896 with the degree of LL.B.,
receiving his LL.M. the following year. In the latter part of 1897
he was admitted to the bar of Michigan and entered the practice of
law in Detroit. In 1898 he went to Pasadena, Calif., to engage in
his profession, but was forced by ill health to return east later in the
same year.

Mr. Swales’ interest in birds began early in life, his first published
paper appearing in 1889 when he was only 14 years of age. His
complete bibliography of ornithological papers numbers just over
a hundred titles, a large proportion of them relating to the birds of
his native State of Michigan. From 1914 he was a member of the
governing board of the zoological museum at Ann Arbor, and for
some years was honorary assistant in ornithology. In 1918 he was
appointed honorary custodian of the section of birds’ eggs of the
National Museum, and in 1921 was made honorary assistant curator
of birds. He contributed to the Institution a fund known as the
Swales fund, through-which were added to the Museum’s collections
many genera and species of rare foreign birds. For several years he
studied the birds of Haiti, and at Fe time of his death, had partly
completed a work on the ornithology of that island undertaken
jointly with Dr. Alexander Wetmore.

Mr. Swales was a member of many ornithological and natural his-
tory societies, and was a founder of the Baird Ornithological Club of
Washington, D. C.

JOSEPH MACE

Joseph Mace, driver of the Smithsonian freight wagon for over
50 years, died on January 26, 1928. Mr. Mace served the Institution
faithfully and with quiet loyalty under all five of its secretaries—
Henry, Baird, Langley, Walcott, and Abbot—and his devotion to
duty merits the highest praise.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 1
REPORT OF THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the condi-
tion and operations of the United States National Museum for the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1928:

The total appr “peusioee for the maintenance of the National
Museum for this period amounted to $650,960, an increase of $41,640
above the appropriation for the year 1927. ‘This additional amount
included an increase of $23,510 under the principal appropriation,
that for preservation of collections, which provided funds for a one-
rate promotion for the staff in accordance with efficiency attained in
the performance of duty as indicated in the annual survey and rating
of the efficiency of all employees, the total sum required for this being
$19,070. An additional $2,280 was required for additions to the
salary roll through reallocations of certain. employees to higher
grades made by the Personnel Classification Board. The remainder,
which came to $2,160, was allotted to miscellaneous purchase of speci-
mens required for the collections, to supplies, and to additional ‘ex-
penditures for freight. The small amount added for the purchase
of specimens has been especially important since it has brought to us
material of great scientific value, and has filled gaps of long standing
in our collections. An increase of $2,770 under the appropriation for
furniture and fixtures allowed $770 for new curtains in certain exhi- |
bition halls in the Natural History Building, and $2,000 for storage
cases, drawers for insect collections, and additional jars, vials, trays,
and other devices for general use in the handling and safeguarding
of our tremendous collections. The addition of $1,360 in the appro-
priation for heating and lighting permitted a one-rate increase to
employees with proper efficiency standing on the salary roll in ques-
tion. Of $1,000 added to the amount available for building repairs,
$60 was for a minor promotion to one employee, and $940 was provided
to cover, in part, replacement and repair on the concrete roadway on
the east side of the Natural History Building. The amount of $500
additional allotted to the sum for printing and binding raised this
sum to $44,000. <A special appropriation of $12,500 covered the con-
struction of a gallery over the west end of the great hall housing the
collections in the Division of Plants. Construction of this gallery,
which was completed during the year, practically doubled the avail-

29
30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

able space for plants, and besides permitting proper expansion of the
collection, allowed for the incorporation of over 200,000 specimens,
the accumulation of a number of years that it had been impossible
to place in their proper series because of lack of space. ‘This gallery,
next to the provision for increase of salaries, has been the most im-
portant improvement that addition to appropriations has permitted
during the year.

The increase in salaries, the first promotion of the kind that has
been possible since the classification act was put into effect on July 1,
1924, has resulted in appreciably higher morale on the part of the
personnel and has reacted most advantageously to the Museum. All
promotions have been well merited.

To look ahead to a matter not properly included in this report but
one pertinent in the present connection, an additional one-rate in-
crease was provided by Congress for the fiscal year 1929, which, with
the Welch Act put in effect at the same time, has placed the staff of
the National Museum generally in greatly improved economic posi-
tion and has thus reacted in producing greater efficiency in the
performance of the work of the Museum. To carry out the full intent
of the reclassification act there is required a further general increase
in pay to place those of the staff with proper efficiency rating at the
average rates of their respective grades. It must be noted also that
there are several groups, particularly among the skilled mechanics,
where the Personnel Classification Board, recognizing that the per-
sons in question were being paid at lower rates than in other Gov-
ernment departments, has given reallocations to Iigher positions.
Promotions should be given to these persons to give them proper com-
pensation. Further additions to the appropriations, so that the vari-
ous groups of salaries may attain the averages provided by law, are
earnestly urged, as such action is eminently and properly the reward
for conscientious performance of duty on the part of the staff and
will react wholly to the advantage of the Institution.

The question of additional personnel is one of considerable impor-
tance, as there is growing necessity for further workers, both on the
scientific staff and in the clerical force. The National Museum,
through the many years of its growth, has developed along broad
lines and now maintains extensive collections. In several groups in
these collections there is now no specialist in charge, and in a number
of divisions assistants should be provided for the older men now in
charge who should be training others in proper methods to carry on
when they themselves are gone. Each year additional cataloguers,
stenographers, typists, and laborers must be employed temporarily to
assist in the work of the Museum. It is often difficult to secure em-
ployees properly equipped for this work on short notice and, further,
it is not always possible to give the considerable training that may be
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 31

required for proper performance of duty in a period of limited
employment. At the present time men of high scientific training
must take time for routine work that could properly, and with
advantage to the public welfare, be done for them by others.

Congestion in our present housing space increases annually in
spite of careful effort to select for preservation only the objects that
must be kept and to eliminate all material that is not permaneatly
desired. As an asset to the Nation the collections of the National
Museum should be made as complete as possible, since in many
instances, unless the materials are secured now, the opportunity to
obtain them will be lost. Growth in our collections is therefore
steady and must continue. In the last 10 years the exhibition halls,
particularly those devoted to arts and industries and to history, have
become increasingly more crowded. Exhibits in the Natural His-
tory Building have been curtailed to make way for historical objects,
and space designed for anthropology has been preempted for dis-
play of objects of art. All this has led, in many instances, to
decided incongruity in association of exhibits, which can not be
avoided under present conditions. Conditions are equally bad in the
laboratories. In the entire Museum the collection of plants is now
practically the only research unit that*has available the requisite
amount of floor space. To provide room in other laboratories there
has been gradual utilization of halls designed originally for passage-
ways, until now cases for the storage of study specimens line the
walls and to some extent close these passage lanes. The situation
is such that the limit of expansion is practically reached, and a
number of divisions are already urgently in need of more space to
house their valuable research collections. Though to one with casual
knowledge it might appear that one or two examples of each kind of
thing is sufficient, it is actually true that good series are imperative
for the scientific investigations of the workers to whom we look for
increase in our knowledge. It is found on close examination that
insects, birds, mammals, fossils of all kinds, plants, mollusks, or, in
fact, any other natural materials or organisms, differ from each
other individually in form, color, dimension, and structure, so that a
series of specimens is required to show the characteristics of a single
species. Such series must be assembled in our national collections,
where they will be available for the workers of the Nation, so that
inevitably our research materials, as well as our exhibitions, increase
and demand more room.

Further housing for the National Museum, as indicated in the
preceding paragraph, is imperative. The collections in arts and
industries are found at present in the old museum, a building that
when completed in 1881 was a model of its kind for the world, but

with modern progress is as much out of date as vehicular trans-
portation of the same period when compared with our modern
facilities. This building should be replaced now by one of modern
design, that will afford a much greater area of floor space and will
have halls properly designed for modern needs in exhibition. The
new building should occupy the site now given to the one in use, but
sho id cover considerably more ground to provide the needed space.
Modern-advances in commerce and industry are tremendous and so
overshadow their modest beginnings that these will be completely
forgotten by coming generations unless the essential steps in their
development are Leena The various stages of growth in all
branches of transportation, engineering, and commerce are of ines-
timable value in affording material stages on which further advances
may be made, to say nothing of their educational importance in their
effect. on the minds of our modern youth. They must be carefully
preserved for this purpose.

When a national gallery of art to house our wonderful art col-
lections shall be constructed the removal of these will free a certain
amount of space in the Natural History Building, but the area left
vacant will be automatically absorbed by the natural-history exhibits

“retired onl jinally to make room for art. There should be added

to the,
_one on.

ral History Building two wings, one on the east and
rest, in accordance with the original plan of the architect,
th-the same height as the present building, will give needed
space for our laboratories.and will house our tremendously valuable
research collections. In some divisions, as, for example, the rooms
assigned to the collections of insects, working conditions have become

.almost intolerable because of the increasing number of persons neces-

sarily engaged in important research, so that now in some instances
four persons must depend upon the light from a single window for
illumination in work requiring delicate examination under the micro-

scope. Additional, gpace in this building would provide for a more

fogical arrangementgef many exhibits and a remodeling of some in
a more modern form, which can not be attempted at present, and
would also give relief from present crowding, which often is tiring
and confusing to the visitor.

-The division of history, a division of the greatest importance to
every patriotic American, with its wonderful series of memorabilia
of those to whom we owe our country and our freedom, its collections
of weapons, war materials, historical objects of all kinds, its great
series of coins and stamps, at present has its exhibits distributed
through the Natural History and the Arts and Industries Buildings
in a manner which does not permit orderly display. There should
be provided for it a separate building, where its treasures may be
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 33

adequately shown for the admiration and:reverence of our people for
generations to come. Certainly all these historic objects, not to be
_ duplicated at any price, should be displayed under the best of condi-
_ tions as a monument to those whom they represent and to the earlier
generations of those who have built our Nation.

With. increase.in material wealth in the United States there has
been developed a steadily growing class of persons who turn to intel-
lectual labors for occupation and aesthetic enjoyment. Many of
these, carefully trained in some one of the sciences, make definite
contributions to knowledge. Others deeply interested care rather to
assist in the labors of others than to make definite additions through
personal efforts. Al are of tremendous assistance in carrying on
the important work of science. All have a sincere belief in the value
of scientific research in all.branches and are deeply interested in
furthering it in any way possible. When it is remembered that these
persons, through their economic situation, make large and definite
annual contribution to the support of the Federal Government
through the sums that they pay in the form of income tax, it must be
admitted that.1t is only logical to take a small part of this contribu-
tion and devote it to the maintenance, growth, and preservation of
the valuable materiais found in the National Museum.

COLLECTIONS

Additions to the collections of the National. Museum during the
fiscal year have reached the tremendous total of 832,912 separate
objects, the largest number: coming to the department of biology.
Material sent fhe examination and report amounted to 1,481 lots, in-
cluding many thousands of specimens. Gifts to schools and other
educational institutions:‘numbered 6,267 specimens, while in exchange
there were sent out 33,724 specimens, these being duplicate materials
for which other things were received in return. More than 25,000
»- specimens of all kinds, many of them highly valuable, were loaned
for study to specialists and other workers outside of Washington.

Following is a. digest of the more important accessions for the year
in the various departments and divisions of the Museum:

_ » Anthropology—During field work on Nunivak Island, ‘Mince Mr.

- Henry B. Collins, jr., and Mr. T. Dale Stewart collected an excellent
series-of ivory, bone, stones, pottery, and wooden objects that give a
_ comprehensive index to the culture of the Eskimo on this igiand. Mr.
Oscar T. Crosby presented a series of specimens, personally collected,
representing the ethnology of the African bushmen.

‘Among valuable collections which have been received through the
field work of the Bureau of American Ethnology there may be men-
. cone especially a series of materials from a basket-maker village
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

site and a near-by pueblo in Chaco Canyon, N. Mex. There may be
noted also a small collection of stone graters, pestles, celts, and a con-
siderable number of clay figurines collected personally by the assist-
ant secretary in the mountains of the Dominican Republic, and a
further series of earthenware vessels and stone and bone ornaments
secured by Mr. Neil M. Judd from Pueblo Bonito and presented by
the National Geographic Society.

Through work financed by Dr. W. L. Abbott, Mr. H. W. Krieger
secured an excellent series of bone and shell implements and pot-
sherds near Samana Bay, Dominican Republic. Excellent series of
prehistoric stone implements were secured by exchange with the
Indian Museum in Calcutta, and the National Museum of Australia.
Further accessions from the Old World include collections made in
France by Dr. George Grant MacCurdy and deposited by the Archee-
ological Society of Washington.

The Division of Physical Anthropology obtained a fine collection
of human skeletal material from the work of Mr. Collins and Mr.
Stewart on Nunivak Island already mentioned, and a further collec-
tion of skulls and skeletons from the west coast of Florida obtained
by Mr. Collins, in work financed by the Bureau of American Eth-
nology.

Biology.—Specimens received in the department of biology during
the fiscal year reached the enormous total of 680,350, a large increase
over the preceding year due principally to certain extensive private
collections that have come to the Museum. Chief among these is the
C. F. Baker collection of insects, formed by Doctor Baker, dean of
the College of Agriculture in Los Banos, P. I., and left by him on his
death to the Museum. In order to obtain this material it was neces-
sary to send Mr. R. A. Cushman, of the Bureau of Entomology, as-
sistant custodian of hymenoptera in the Museum, to Manila to pack
the collection and see that it was transferred safely to Washington,
an arrangement that was possible through the cooperation of the
United States Department of Agriculture. The series included is one
of the finest ever assembled of the insects of the Philippine Islands,
and is also rich in general East Indian material. The C. G. Lloyd
mycological collection, comprising 75,000 specimens of the larger
fungi, was transferred to the Smithsonian Institution during the year
by the trustees of the Lloyd estate. There are included in addition
10,000 photographic negatives of fungi, a voluminous series of notes
pertaining to the specimens, and a comprehensive card catalogue.
The whole comprises one of the largest and most important collec-
tions in the group ever brought together. Among other accessions,
the Charles W. Hargitt hydroid collection is especially important, as
't represents the lifetime work of this well-known specialist.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 35

Through Dr. Hugh M. Smith, associate curator in zoology, director
of fisheries of Siam, there came important collections of mammals,
birds, reptiles, fishes, insects, mollusks, and miscellaneous inverte-
brates. Further series came from China through the courtesy of Col.
R. 8. Clark from the work of Mr. A. de C. Sowerby, of especial im-
portance being some excellent series of fishes. Through the coopera-
tion of Mr. William N. Beach, Mr. Marcus Daly, and Mr. Osgood
Field, the Museum was able to send Mr. W. L. Brown, of the staff in
taxidermy, to the Sudan, where he obtained a valuable set of mam-
mals, birds, and fishes of importance in our collections. A group of
gazelles obtained will be mounted for the exhibition halls. Eight
female gorilla skulls were acquired by purchase.

Mr. B. H. Swales, honorary assistant curator of birds, whose death
came during the year, contributed 4 genera and 26 species of birds
new to the Museum collections. The collections of Doctor Wetmore,
assistant secretary, made last year when traveling under the Swales
fund in Hispaniola, included series of birds, reptiles, and amphibians,
and other zoological collections of a miscellaneous nature. The work
of Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., curator of mammals, who visited the
Dominican Republic at his own expense, and that of Mr. A. J. Poole,
of the division of mammals, who carried on extensive explorations in
the caves of Haiti, under funds provided by Dr. W. L. Abbott,
brought important collections of bones of extinct animals and birds,
as well as excellent series of existiny reptiles and amphibians and
other specimens of value.

Among accessions in the division of insects there may be mentioned
the gift of the George M. Greene collection of coleoptera, including
nearly 50,000 specimens, and representing many years of careful and
painstaking work. Through Dr. R. C. McGregor, the Philippine
Bureau of Science has forwarded large series of Philippine insects,
while other important additions to these collections have come through
the work of the Bureau of Entomology. Prof. T. D. A. Cockerell
presented a collection of insects from Russia and Siberia.

The Amory-Bowman Labrador expedition, arranged through co-
operation with Mr. Copley S. Amory, brought collections from the
coast of Labrador, including a comprehensive set of arthropods. The
Bureau of Fisheries, United States Department of Commerce, trans-
ferred 5,467 specimens of marine invertebrates, the most important
being from the Albatross expeditions of 1907-1909, which have been
in the hands of specialists for study to this time, and a series of
crustacea procured from Harvey C. McMillan.

Through the Frances Lea Chamberlain fund the division of mol-
lusks obtained over 50,000 specimens of land shells from Jamaica,
which were collected by C. R. Orcutt. Dr. Charles de la Torre, of
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

Habana, Cuba, presented 185 lots of mollusks, mostly ieee of new
species.

In the division of plants important accessions have included 9,000
specimens collected in Honduras for the Museum by Mr. Paul C.
Standley; more than 5,000 specimens, mainly grasses, transferred
from the Bureau of Plant Industry; and nearly 3,000 from Formosa
and Sumatra, representing a complete set of the material ‘collected
by Prof. H. H. Bartlett, collaborator of the Museum, under the joint
auspices of the National Museum and the University of Michigan.

Geology—Under the Roebling fund, established last year, there
have been secured by purchase examples of four new species of min-
erals; some rare minerals from Franklin Furnace, N. J., now difficult
to procure; a large mass of strongly magnetic lodestone from Utah,
which attracts much attention in our exhibition halls; and a number
of beautiful minerals for the exhibition and study series. These
constitute highly important additions to our collections which other-
wise it would have been impossible to procure, illustrating the value
of special funds under the Smithsonian Institution for the purchase
of needed specimens. Fait

There may be mentioned also a 65-carat cut gem of alexandrite, one .
of the finest in existence, secured under the Chamberlain fund,
together with a fine Mexican opal, a brown diamond, and some other
beautiful minerals. Miss Nina Lea, grandaughter of Isaac Lea,
founder of the Isaac Lea collection, presented an unusual series of
cut stones of sphene. Mr. William P. Pitts, of Sunnyvale, Calif.,
presented five varieties of cut semiprecious stones, with examples of
the rough minerals from which they were derived.

iene field work in Mexico by Dr. W.. F..¥Foshag, assistant
curator of mineralogy and petrology, working in cooperation with
Harvard University, groups of gypsum crystals, sets of valuable
ores, and many other important specimens were collected.

Through the bequest of Dr. Frank Springer, late associate in
paleontology, the Museum has received the Frank Springer collection
of fossil echinoderms, together with a very complete library on this
subject. The collection, considered the most complete assemblage of
fossil echinoderms in the world, comprises upward of 75,000 speci-
mens, including many types. Ww ith it has come the Springer fund,
established by the donor to promote work in connection with his
collection.

A second gift of value is.the private collection of Paleozoic He sui:
brates from Dr. August F. Foerste, collaborator in paleontology,
containing types of many species. The field work of Mr. E. R. Pohl
in Michigan and ‘Ontario yielded important series of Ordovician,
Devonian, and Mississippian fossils.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 37

Transfers from the United States Geological Survey have included
collections of Upper Cambrian fossils secured by T. S. Lovering in
Colorado, and other important collections.

The division of vertebrate paleontology acquired by purchase the
skeleton of an extinct lizard, Clidastes, and one of the rare three-
toed horses from the Miocene of Wyoming. A further collection of
fossil footprints came through Mr. Gilmore’s third visit to the
Grand. Canyon, while work in Florida by Dr. J. W. Gidley has
brought important material from the Pleistocene deposits of that
State.

The types of five species of fossil birds described recently by
Doctor Wetmore have been deposited by the Colorado Museum of
Natural History.

Arts and industries —The single object of greatest popular interest
that has come to the National Museum in many years is Colonel
Lindbergh’s airplane, the Spirit of St. Lowis, deposited with the
Smithsonian Institution, which has drawn large crowds since the
first day of its installation... There may be mentioned also the Pan
American good-will flyer San Francisco, transferred from the War
Department, with the Army Curtiss racer airplane which won the
Pulitzer and Schneider races of 1925. A Curtiss pusher type air-
plane of the period 1909-1914 is also an important addition. For
the land transportation section there was secured a White-Stanhope
steam automobile of 1901-2. Mr. Guy M. Gest, who piloted the first
electric railway car operated in Baltimore in 1885, presented a series
of photographic enlargements of this vehicle from his original nega-
tives. The Hudson River Day Line presented two steamship models,
one of Fulton’s steamboat of 1807, and one of the Hendrich-Hudson
built in 1906 and still in service. |

The New Haven Clock Co. presented to the section of horology 75
objects illustrating ancient and modern watch and clock movements,
together with an exhibit demonstrating how standard time is ob-
tained, the whole constituting a visual history of American clock
and watch making since 1775.

The Eddystone Cement Co., through Mr. E. R. Wilmer, pre-
sented a 5-foot section of an ancient Roman aqueduct built in 86
A. D. in Germany. The structure, which resembles rough concrete,
is in a remarkable state of preservation, being apparently as strong
to-day as ever.

The division of textiles received further exhibits dealing with
rayon or artificial silk. The Crompton & Knowles Loom Works pre-
sented an automatic gingham loom of the latest type. The Bureau
of Agricultural Economics of the Department of Agriculture trans-
ferred three sets of official standards of the United States for grades

24034—29——4
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

of wool. A series of the new print silks, prepared by H. R. Mallin-
son & Co., was another important addition.

In the section of organic chemistry there was received an exhibit
dealing with pyrolin, manufactured by the Du Pont Viscoloid Co.,
and from the Shawinigan Products Corporation a series of chemical
specimens obtained from limestone and coke. An additional exhibit
dealing with disease-carrying insects was prepared in the Museum
during the year and added to the hygiene and sanitation collection.

In the section of wood technology arrangement was made for the
loan of a collection of walking sticks belonging to Mr. Rudolph
Block, the collection consisting of the interesting woods of the world
prepared in the form of canes, a series unique so far as is known.

In the division of graphic arts the Misses Dodge presented a set
of 24 engravings by Moseley Isaac Danforth, one of America’s fore-
most engravers. Through exchange the division obtained a copy of
a book by Dard Hunter entitled “ Primitive Paper Making,” made
entirely by hand. Mr. Wiliam Edwin Rudge donated four ex-
amples of microform printing, including a volume of Mark Twain’s
The Innocents Abroad, in which 93,000 werds are printed on 13
pages measuring 534 by 384 inches. A collection of the work of
Henry Fox Talbot was presented by a descendant, Miss M. Talbot,
O. B. E., of Lacock Abbey, Wiltshire, England. Mr. I. N. Phelps
Stokes presented a series of specimens of considerable historic impor-
tance relating to Muybridge’s work on motion pictures.

The Radio Corporation of America deposited the apparatus used
in receiving the first photoradiogram across the Atlantic—a picture
of President Coolidge sent from London and received on November
27, 1924, in the office of the company in New York City.

History —Mrs. Agnes K. Brent, through the Missouri Historical
Society, gave a silk flag presented by the ladies of Nashville, Tenn.,
to the Nashville Battalion during the Creek War in 1813. The naval
collections were increased by a series of interesting relics of Rear
Admiral Charles D. Sigsbee, given by Mrs. Nellie C. Gunther.

From the Treasury Department there was received a series of
United States gold, silver, and bronze coins struck in the mints of the
Government in 1927; also a series of ancient Roman and modern
European and oriental coins. Mr. Isaac M. Weills presented a col-
lection of American and European coins and tokens.

The philatelic collection was increased by more than 27,000 speci-
mens, in part transferred from the Post Office Department and in
part presented by Mr. Weills, with the coins mentioned above. Two
United States 5-cent stamps found in the seam folds of the mail bag
carried by Commander Byrd on his flight to France in the airplane
America were also placed in this collection.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 39

The Precancel Stamp Society, through Mr. Walter L. Gates, con-
tinued its development of the collection of precancel stamps, a series
augmented by gifts from Mr. Gates personally.

To the Loeb collection of chemical types 102 samples were added
during the year, bringing the total number of specimens to 1,092.
There is assurance of hearty cooperation in developing this collection.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

Through explorations financed by special funds made available by
friends of the Institution, through a variety of cooperative arrange-
ments with other organizations, and to some extent from funds pro-
vided under the Museum appropriations, there have come many
valuable specimens and much new information in various fields of
science. A brief résumé of some of the important explorations and
field work under the National Museum follows:

In the Alaskan field, Mr. Henry B. Collins, jr., and Mr. T. Dale
Stewart, under funds supplied by the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, the Council of Learned Societies, and the
United States National Museum, conducted field work during the
summer of 1927 on Nunivak Island, on the Bering Sea coast of
Alaska. Explorations of several ancient village sites were carried
out and anthropological measurements of the natives and observa-
tions on their social life were made. In addition much anthropo-
logical material was gathered during landings along the coast on the
journey to the site of the season’s investigations. The material col-
lected includes an excellent series of skeletal remains and numerous
valuable objects of material culture.

Mr. Herbert W. Krieger, through a grant from the National
Academy of Sciences, and funds supplied by the Bureau of American
Ethnology, visited the old site at Bonasila, Alaska, for remains that
had attracted Doctor Hrdlicka’s attention the year before. Unfore-
seen high water in the Yukon prevented complete examination, but
important information and specimens dealing with ancient Eskimos
were obtained. He also collected ethnologica from Eskimo in several
villages on the Yukon. During this same season Mr. Krieger con-
tinued archeological investigations along the Columbia and Snake
Rivers, bringing in many specimens, some of which, from the Snake,
appear to represent an outlying site of Pueblo Indian culture.

Mr. Neil M. Judd, on detached detail, worked for the seventh field
season at Pueblo Bonito, in Chaco Canyon, N. Mex., as director of
the National Geographie Society’s archeological exploration of
that ancient pueblo. Through the interest of the society there has
been uncovered and set in order for inspection of the public one
of the largest pueblos of the prehistoric period as it stood perhaps
1,000 years ago. Mr. Judd was occupied this season principally in
40) ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

obtaining final data for incorporation in his report. The investiga-
tions as a whole have given extensive and valuable series of objects
dealing with comparatively late pueblo. culture, which through the
generous gift of the National Geographic Society have greatly en-
hanced the Museum collections in the pueblo culture of the Southwest.
At the close of the fiscal year Mr. Judd was in-the field for the
Bureau of American Ethnology, examining caves in Russell County,
Ky., where textiles and other interesting specimens had been exhumed.
Dr. Ales Hrdlicka, traveling partly under a grant from'the Smith-
sonian Institution and partly at personal expense, was in Europe

for seven weeks in the fall of 1927 for the purpose of viewing the

latest discoveries of early man. He examined sites of important
finds in southern France and then proceeded to Belgium and later
to Germany, where he visited the localities in the Neander Valley
typical for the race of Neanderthal.man. In southern Moravia
he investigated the area that had recently given important finds
in Aurignacian man, and continued then to hae for work on the
material accumula a there in the Museum of Natural Histor y and

to London for examination of the collections in*the College of Phy-'

sicians and Surgeons. -While in London he was the recipient of the
Huxley medal of the Royal Society for his extensive investigations
and researches in anthropology and delivered the Huxley lecture on
“The Neanderthal Phase of Man.”

Dr. Walter Hough in the early fall of 1927 examined for the
Bureau of American Ethnology a large burial mound at Indian
Mound, Tenn., to determine the type of slab-box burial. He also
visited near-by village sites, flint quarries, and burial grounds, obtain-
ing a considerable amount of material. In one of the village sites on
the Cumberland River there were obtained numerous shells oH mol-
lusks of a species now extinct in that stream.

Mr. H. B. Collins, jr., during January, 1928, visited for the Bureau

of American Ethnology areas near Fort Myers, Fla., where mounds of

the Calusa Indian type were reported. He atta skeletal remains."

people, who, though they existed within historic times, have become
extinct and are comparatively little known.

paragraph. Mr. Krieger visited a number ‘of caves in the San
Lorenzo Bay section, excavating extensive middens found therein, and
obtaining much information of value. The middens, composed prin-
cipally of shells and other kitchen refuse, were in places from 4 to 8

feet in thickness, and contained artifacts of various kinds. Follow-
ing this, two Arawak village sites at Anadel and the mouth of the
Rio San Juan on the Samana Peninsula, whose location had been
indicated by Doctor Abbott from earlier observations, were excavated
carefully with the recovery of many articles of scientific importance.
Officials of the Dominican Republic cooperated most courteously in
furthering this work, which it is expected will be continued in the
coming year.

The travels of Gabb in the seventies of the last century brought to
Washington a few bones of curious mammals from the caves of San
Lorenzo in the Dominican Republic, to which have been added fur-
ther specimens obtained within recent years by Dr. W. L. Abbott.
In May, 1927, Assistant Secretary Wetmore in travels in this region
observed extensive midden deposits in these caves still untouched that
gave promise of further material of importance. Mr. G. 8. Miller,
jr., curator of mammals, deeply interested in the extinct mammals of
the island, visited this area at his own expense in. February and
March, 1928, accompanied by Mrs. Miller. As the excavations to be
made were also of great archeological interest, Mr. H. W. Krieger,
as already stated, was detailed to conduct that phase of the work
through funds provided by Dr. W. L. Abbott. These joint investi-
gations proved of great importance as there were obtained through
them extensive series of bones of mammals and certain birds long ex-
tinct, from which there will come fuller understanding of their form
and structure. The work was continued at the mouth of the Rio San
Juan and at Anadel on the Samana Peninsula, resulting in additional
osteological specimens of importance. The material obtained is now
being studied.

Through the further interest of Dr. W. L. Abbott, Mr. Arthur J.
Poole, of the division of mammals, was occupied from December 8,
1927, to March 21, 1928, in a thorough exploration of the well-known
caves near San Michel, Haiti, obtaining large collections of bones of
the extinct animals which occur in these deposits. It was particu-
larly important that these specimens be collected at this time, since
the earth on the cave floors was being removed for use as fertilizer,
and in a short time all material of scientific value would have been
destroyed. As incidental to this work Mr. Poole secured considerable
collections of herpetological material and other zoological specimens.
Reconnaissance of other caverns may indicate desirability of further
work in these deposits from which many bones of mammals and birds
have been obtained.

Mr. W. L. Brown, of the taxidermist staff of the Museum, was de-
tailed to accompany an expedition to the Sudan organized by Mr.
William N. Beach to secure large mammals, The original party con-
42 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

sisted of Mr. and Mrs. Beach, Mr. Marcus Daly, and Mr. Osgood
Field. Sailing from Hoboken on January 4 on the S. 8S. George
Washington, Mr. Brown and Mr. Field proceeded to Cherbourg,
France, and from there continued by rail to Marseilles, where they
joined the rest of the party and took steamer to Port Sudan, continu-
ing from there by train to Khartoum. In a chartered boat, the Lord
Oromer, they navigated as far as Malakal, about 50 miles up the
White Nile, where the sudden illness of Mr. Beach made it necessary
to return to Khartoum and prevented his continuing with the party.
The others proceeded, working the territory between Khartoum and
Rejaf. During 20 days in the field Mr. Daly, Mr. Field, and Mr.
Brown collected many scientific specimens, as well as material for
an exhibition group of gazelles, with all necessary accessories of
earth, ant hills, thorn bushes, and other vegetation. Apart from the
specimens obtained for the Museum collections, Mr. Brown observed
in a wild state, elephants, lions, antelopes, hippos, wart hogs, buffa-
loes, giraffes, zebras, several cats, monkeys, crocodiles, and birds of
many varieties, including the shoe-bill stork—experience of great
profit to a taxidermist. He returned to Washington in April. The
collections brought home included 49 mammals, 83 bird skins, 103
alcoholic birds and skeletons, and a large number of reptiles and
fishes.

In November, 1927, following a stay in this country, Dr. Hugh M.
Smith, director of fisheries of Siam and associate curator in zoology
of the National Museum, returned to Bangkok, where he resumed
active collecting of zoological materials. Word has already come of
large gatherings of specimens.

In spite of the political situation in China, Mr. A. de C. Sowerby,
under the auspices of Col. R. S. Clark, continued his researches and
collecting. A large consignment of reptiles, fishes, and marine
invertebrates has come from him during the year.

Dr. D. C. Graham, who has forwarded such splendid collections
from western Szechuan, China, returned in the late fall of 1927 to
Suifu, where he began at once his zoological studies. The first fruits
of his endeavors have been received and include interesting collec-
tions of birds, reptiles, and invertebrates.

Dr. J. M. Aldrich, associate curator of insects, who at his own
expense was in the field at the end of June, 1927, continued entomo-
logical collecting during the months of July and August at various
points in the West, eastern Nevada, the higher parts of the Sierra
Nevada in California, and the Yellowstone Park, which proved to be
localities of greatest interest. While the principal object of his work
was the collecting of Diptera, valuable material in other orders of
insects was secured.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 43

Mr. James O. Maloney, aide in the division of marine invertebrates,
while on a vacation tour at his own expense, secured many valuable
specimens of terrestrial isopods in Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama,
and Mississippi.

At the invitation of Mr. Copley Amory, of Washington, D. C.,
Mr. and Mrs. Paul Bowman of George Washington University, and
Doctor Bartsch, curator of mollusks, proceeded in June, 1927, to Mr.
Amory’s summer home on Matamek River on the north shore of the
Gulf of St. Lawrence, where Doctor Bartsch initiated plans for a
study of the local flora and fauna which were continued by Mr. and
Mrs. Bowman until September. Mr. Amory placed a laboratory pro-
vided with the needed equipment for research and other facilities
at the disposal of the party, and was ever ready to give the benefit
of his knowledge of local conditions acquired through many years
of residence, as well as personal help. In addition to marine dredg-
ing, careful collecting was done along the beaches, in the shallow
lagoons and tide pools, and in the inland pools, lakes, and streams
of the region for fresh-water organisms. Collections were secured
of the ectoparasites and endoparasites of fishes and careful analyses
of the stomach contents of fishes were made. Mr. Bowman devoted
time to the plants, covering all groups from marine and fresh-water
algae to the flowering groups. Serial cores of the peat bogs were
taken and the samples shipped to Washington for microscopic study.
A large amount of material, both animals and plants, was collected
which is to be worked up later.

In continuation of Cerion studies mentioned in previous reports,
Doctor Bartsch visited the laboratory of the Carnegie Institution
at the Tortugas from August 16 to 27, 1927. The year had been an
unusually dry one at the Tortugas, affecting adversely some of the
groups of Cerions under observation. Visits were made to all the
colonies of Cerions in the Tortugas, and material-collected for study
in Washington. <A series of specimens of Cerion viaregis from the
Tortugas and Cerion incanum from Key West, and of a hybrid
Cerion from Newfound Harbor Key, were gathered and sent to Prof.
Edward C. Jeffrey, Harvard University, for a comparative study
of their chromosomes.

Botanical field work during the year 1927-28 has been conducted
in Honduras by Mr. Paul C. Standley, associate curator; in the
islands of Formosa and Sumatra by Prof. H. H. Bartlett, col-
laborator; in Texas by the late Dr. J. N. Rose, associate curator; in
Oregon and Washington by Dr. A. S. Hitchcock, custodian of grasses;
and in California by Mr. J. R. Swallen, assistant in the grass herba-
rium. Mr. Standley’s botanical exploration in Honduras was made
possible by the generous cooperation of Prof. Oakes Ames, of Har-
vard University, and the United Fruit Co. Work began in December
44 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

and was conducted from headquarters at Tela, being mainly confined
to the lowlands.and adjacent low mountains along the north coast.
During four months upward of 9,000 specimens were collected, these
representing the largest single botanical collection ever procured in
Honduras. The material is of unusual interest, since it contains many
new specimens and others not known previously from that region.
Professor Bartlett’s field) work in Formosa and Sumatra, financed
from personal funds, was conducted under the joint auspices of the
National Museum and the University of Michigan. The period of
exploration in Formosa, though short, yielded specimens of many
endemic species, chiefly from the higher mountains, which were not
previously represented in American herbaria. In Sumatra the field
work was continued from December, 1926, to the middle of July,
1927, and resulted in the accumulation of a large collection consisting
of about 2,400 numbers, mostly represented by 5 to 10 specimens each.
The exploration included the ascent of several. volcanoes and lesser
mountains and a reconnaissance of the Asahan region. The impor-
tance of this collection can scarcely be overestimated in view of the
rapid destruction of the Sumatran jungle, whose components are
still very imperfectly known.

In connection with current investigations of native plants as
potential sources of rubber, the late Dr. J. N. Rose, associate curator
of plants, was detailed to field work in Texas during October and
November, 1927, through funds supplied by Mr. Thomas A. Edison.
From the economi¢ standpoint the results were chiefly negative, but
a considerable collection of herbarium material was obtained for use
in other current studies, chiefly an investigation of the families.
Caesalpinaceae and Mimosaceae. In this work Doctor Rose was ac-
companied by Mr. Paul G. Russell, on detail from the Bureau of
Plant Industry.

Field studies of grasses for the United States Department of Agri-
culture were conducted during the summer of 1927 in the Pacific
coast region of the United States by Dr. A. S. Hitchcock, custodian of
the section of grasses, and Mr. J. R. Swallen, assistant in the grass
herbarium. Doctor Hitchcock spent about 10 weeks in the mountains
of Oregon and Washington, in cooperation with the Forest Service,
and a similar period was spent in California by Mr. Swallen. In
both cases the object of the investigation was to determine the amount
and character of variation in the grass species due to environmental
and other factors, and to discover differential characters for the vari-
ous species. Excellent collections of illustrative material were ob-
tained. At the present time Mr. Swallen is absent on a similar field
trip in the southwestern United States.

Under an allotment from the Roebling fund, Dr. W. F. Foshag
visited several mineral localities in the State of Sonora, Mexico. The
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY  - 45

chief point of interest was the Chispas mine, near Arispe, where Doc-
tor Foshag procured a series of the magnificent silver minerals found
there. During several days spent at Bisbee, Ariz., in collecting min-
—erals and examining material offered for sale, some very interesting
specimens were added to the collections. . In cooperation with the
‘mineralogical museum of Harvard University, and accompanied by
a representative of that institution, Dector Foshag spent three months
collecting minerals and examining mineral deposits in the States of
Guanajuato, Zacatecas, Durango, and Chihuahua, Mexico. <A consid-
erable amount of excellent exhibition and study material was ob-
tained, including groups of large gypsum crystals, a fine series of
lead and zinc minerals, and complete sets of ores and rocks from all
of the important mining districts visited. These will be used as the
basis of a report on these districts.

Drs. C. E. Resser and R. S. Bassler spent two ninth in the Rocky
Mountain region in a reexamination of certain Canadian sections for
stratigraphic details necessary for the completion of Doctor Walcott’s
unfinished manuscript summarizing the knowledge gained in his
years of extensive research. The area examined was covered by
motor and the researches were at various times greatly facilitated by
the cooperation of other geologists familiar with local sections. The
territory covered included the Wasatch Mountains, Yellowstone Na-
tional Park and the mountains immediately north, and the area along -
Newland Creek, Meagher County, Mont. Stops were also made in the
Little Belt Mountains. The main objective of the summer’s work,
however, was the general region of the Bow Valley, Canadian Rocky
Mounting: north and west of Banff, Alberta, and certain other locali-
ties well en from Doctor Walcott’ s investigations.

In cooperation with the Milwaukee Public Museum, Dr. Erwin
Pohl continued a detailed study of the little known but highly im-
portant stratigraphy of the Middle Paleozoic of the mid-EKastern and
Central States. The researches of the season covered portions of
eastern Wisconsin, southern Michigan, northern Ohio, and southern
Ontario. Nearly 2 tons of selected and beautifully preserved fossils
resulted from the trip.

Dr. Joseph A. Cushman, collaborator in paleontology, spent the
greater part of the summer of 1927 in a field trip through various
countries of western Europe primarily to secure collections of fossil
foraminifera from classic areas. He was highly successful in his
work, and as a result, large numbers of types will come to the Museum
upon the completion of his studies.

Late in the fiscal year Mr. Gilmore was detailed for an expedition
in the Two Medicine formation in Montana to search for dinosaur
and other vertebrate remains, with Mr. George F. Sternberg, who
has had long and varied experience in fossil collecting, as his assist-
46 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

ant. Incomplete reports to date indicate the finding of valuable
material. As the expedition will continue into the next fiscal year,
a detailed report will be given later.

Exploratory work in the Pleistocene was again taken up by Dr.
J. W. Gidley at Melbourne and other localities in Florida. The
expedition, which covered a little more than two months, was made
possible through the generosity of Mr. Childs Frick, who furnished
half of the funds necessary for carrying on the work, the remainder
coming from the Smithsonian Institution. Doctor Gidley was as-
sisted by Mr. C. P. Singleton, of Melbourne. Two principal prob-
lems involved in this research included the further search for evidence
on the contemporaneity of man with an extinct fauna in Florida, a
much-disputed question, and the collection of additional material for
the purpose of fixing more definitely the age of this fauna. The
results in both cases are regarded as highly satisfactory.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

Minor repairs of various kinds have been required to keep the
buildings housing the Museum in proper condition during the year.
In the Natural History Building, woodwork of windows on the
ground and third floors was repainted, and the interior woodwork
on windows on the third floor was refinished. The ceiling and
walls in the bird range were pointed up and painted, and wooden
floors in rooms occupied by the division of mammals and the Bio-
logical Survey and in the office of the assistant secretary were refin-
ished. ‘Tin-lined gutters on the roofs were given a coat of metallic
and oil paint; broken glass in various windows was replaced; wooden
ladders were installed for use in inspecting the walls supporting the
dome on the attic floor, and down pipes leading from the roof were
repaired.

In the Arts and Industries Building metal roofs were repainted,
ventilating windows were repaired and provided with screens, and
wooden window frames and sash recoated with lead and oil paint.
The southwest range was repainted, as well as the gallery, and an
iron-pipe railing installed on the latter to replace a temporary guard
rail formerly in use. The composition floor of the reading room
in the library was covered with cork carpet. A wire screen parti-
tion was built on the third floor of the northeast pavilion to pre-
vent unauthorized persons from entering the Mechanical Technology
Laboratory; a concrete floor was laid about the mine exhibit in
the southwest pavilion; and sheet-iron hoods were made for radi-
ators in the Lace Hall to protect the walls from accumulation of dirt.

In the Smithsonian Building a hot-water system was installed;
stairs leading to the comfort rooms were repaired; the doors in the
disbursing agent’s office were remodeled; the east entrance vestibule
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 47

was repaired and painted; and doors in the storage room were made
fireproof by covering with sheet iron,

The exterior of the Aircraft Building was repainted and broken
glass replaced.

The work of replacement of the main portion of the concrete
service road east of the Natural History Building was continued,
18014 linear feet being laid during the year.

The power plant was in operation from September 21, 1927, until
May 29, 1928. The consumption of coal was 3,416 tons, an amount
in excess of that used in 1927. The average cost of coal was some-
what greater than for the preceding year, being $5.87 per ton. ‘The
Steamboat Inspection Service of the United States examined the
boilers during the summer and reported them in good condition,
stating that they complied with all regulations governing steam
boilers of this type. The elevators have been regularly inspected
by the District of Columbia inspector, and are now equipped with
all necessary safeguards to protect passengers. ‘The total electric
current produced amounted to 603,343 kilowatt-hours, manufactured
at a cost of 1.89 cents per kilowatt-hour, including interest on the
plant, depreciation, labor, and material. The engineer reports a
decided increase in efficiency in the production of electric current,
due to installation of new pistons in the operating engines, an essen-
tial increase, as the demands for light and power from all the build-
ings grow larger each year. The ice plant manufactured 354.3 tons
of ice at an average cost of $2.4114 per ton, which is slightly less than
the cost for the previous year.

During the year 23 exhibition cases and bases, 226 pieces of storage,
laboratory, and office furniture, and 2,178 drawers of various kinds
were added, practically all of these being manufactured in our shops.

MEETINGS AND RECEPTIONS

The lecture rooms and auditorium of the National Museum during
the present year were used for 115 meetings, which covered a wide
range of activities. Governmental agencies that utilized these re-
sources for hearings, meetings, lectures, and exhibitions of pic-
tures included the Commission of Fine Arts, the Graduate School
of the United States Department of Agriculture, the Federal Hor-
ticultural Board, the Forest Service, the Federal Radio Commission,
the Bureau of Plant Industry, and the Extension Service of the
United States Department of Agriculture.

Members of the Forest Service held a series of meetings during
the year dealing with various phases of their work. The Smithsonian
staff was convened on February 17, 1928, for an address with motion

Mothers, District of Columbia Chapter, met on April 27 for addresses
by Representative Royal C. Johnson, of South Dakota, and Gen.
Amos A. Fries. Music was furnished by the United States Marine
Band.

The Fifth National Oratorial Contest was held in the auditorium
on May 10. The Fourth Annual National Spelling Bee came on May
22, with 25 boys and girls entered for the contest. The first prize was
won by Miss Betty Popa Noe atom the South Bend News-
Times.

The Veterans of Foreign Wars of the United States, Federal Post,
No. 821, United States Department of Agriculture, met on May 28
for addresses by R. W. Dunlap, Assistant Secretary, United States
Department of Agriculture, and Maj. Gen. Charles P. Summerall,
United States Army. Music was furnished by the Navy Band.

Other agencies using the auditorium or lecture room included the
Washington Times, the National Association of Retired Federal
Employees, classes from George Washington University and Howard
University, the Boy Scouts, groups from the public schools of the
District of Columbia, and the Smithsonian Relief Association.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 49

On January 24, 1928, at 11 a. m., there-was held a special memorial
meeting under direction of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution to commemorate the life and work of Charles Doolittle
Walcott, fourth Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution. The gath-
ering was presided over by the chancellor of the Institution, the
Hon. William Howard Taft, Chief Justice of the United States.
Addresses were delivered by Dr. John C. Merriam, representing the
Carnegie Institution of Washington; Dr. Joseph 8. Ames, for the
National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics; Dr. George Otis
Smith, for the United States Geological Survey; and Dr. Charles G.
Abbot, for the National Academy of Sciences and the Smithsonian
Institution.

Special exhibitions in connection with various meetings included
an historical exhibit dealing with ornithology arranged in connection
with the convention of the American Ornithologists’ Union during
November, and one concerned with the work of American artists
portraying mammals in connection with the annual meeting of the
American Society of Mammalogists from April 1 to 15.

On the evening of February 28 members of the Geological Society
of Washington were given a special view of the geological collections
im the National Museum. From March 1 to 3 there was a special dis-
play of the work in nature study in the fourth to the eighth grades in
the District of Columbia schools arranged under Miss Esther W.
Scott, teacher of elementary science.

On June 21 there was a special meeting in the Arts and Industries
Building of a group of 100 persons representing the Chamber of
Commerce of St. Louis and other backers of the Lindbergh flight,
who assembled for a ceremony beneath Colonel Lindbergh’s plane,
the Spirit of St. Louis, when a silver medal commemorating the first
New York-to-Paris flight was presented to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution. The Secretary responded with a brief address, in which he
expressed the thanks of the Institution to those closest to Colonel
Lindbergh in his great venture for the privilege of exhibiting the
plane in the Museum halls.

MISCELLANEOUS

The exhibition halls of the National Museum were open during
the year on week days from 9 a. m. to 4.30 p. m., while in addition
the Natural History Building and the Arts and Industries Building
were opened Sunday afternoons from 1.30 to 4.30. From January
22 to the close of the year the exhibits in the Smithsonian Building:
were also opened to the public on Sunday afternoon for the hours
indicated, All buildings were closed on Christmas Day and New
Year’s Day.
50 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

Visitors to the Museum during the year totaled 1,413,386 persons,
an increase of more than 260,000 over the previous year, an excellent
index to the number of Americans who come to visit the National
Capital. Attendance in the several buildings was recorded as fol-
lows: Smithsonian, 175,190; Arts and Industries, 517,238; Natural
History, 618,773; Aircraft, 102,185.

The average daily attendance for week days was 3,901 and for
Sundays 3,761. The public has shown great appreciation of the
privilege of entrance to our exhibits on Sunday afternoons.

During the year the Museum published 10 volumes and 59 sepa-
rate papers, while the distribution of lterature amounted to 111,405
copies of its various books and pamphlets.

Additions to the Museum library have included 3,015 volumes
and 1,165 pamphlets, obtained partly by exchange and partly by
donation. The library of the National Museum, as separate from
that of the Smithsonian Institution proper, has now 72,315 volumes
and 106,881 pamphlets. Though most of the accessions for the
present year, as usual, came through an exchange of publications,
there may be noted the donation of 595 volumes and many additional
separate papers from the American Association for the Advancement
of Science, among them many works now out of print and very rare,
which have served to complete a number of important sets on our
shelves. Mr. William K. Vanderbilt presented a copy of his pri-
vately printed work entitled “'To Galapagos on the Ava.” Mr.
Thomas A. McCaslin presented a bound manuscript entitled “A
Souvenir of Wyoming,” including a diary of a trip in Jackson Hole
and Yellowstone Park, with many remarks on early history and his-
torical geography. The Librarian of Congress transferred 68 vol-
umes and 47 parts to supplement our reference works, and about
300 volumes, chiefly on the religions of the Old World, were received
from the estate of Dr. I. M. Casanowicz, late assistant curator of the
division of Old World archeology. During the year the library
staff completed the sorting of a large accumulation of reprints, which
were placed in the hands of the curators to whose work they were
most related. A number of special collections of books, including
the Casey, Dall, Gill, Henderson, Lacoe, Roebling, Schaus, Springer,
and Teller libraries were listed in preparation for cataloguing.

Dr. Samuel W. Woodhouse, for some time associated with the
Institution in connection with the art collections presented to the
National Gallery of Art by the late Alfred Duane Pell, was given
honorary appointment as collaborator in ceramics. Mr. Robert A.
Cushman, of the Bureau of Entomology, United States Department
of Agriculture, was made assistant custodian of hymenoptera. Mr.
Arthur Cleveland Bent, of Taunton, Mass., well known for his com-
prehensive volumes on the life histories of North American birds,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY an

was appointed collaborator in the division of birds. Dr. Joseph A.
Cushman, an international authority on foraminifera, was appointed
collaborator in foraminifera in the division of marine invertebrates.
Dr. W. T. Schaller was given honorary appointment as associate in
mineralogy in the department of geology.

Mr. Ellsworth P. Killip, aide in the division of plants, was ad-
vanced on December 1 to assistant curator and, following the resigna-
tion of Mr. Paul C. Standley on May 31, to associate curator. On
June 1 Mr. Emery C. Leonard was made assistant curator in the divi-
sion of plants. Miss M. F. Willoughby was appointed senior clerk
in the division of stratigraphic paleontology on December 16. ‘The
division of Old World archeology, following the death of Dr, Casa-
nowicz, has been placed temporarily under the general supervision of
Mr. Neil M. Judd, curator of American archeology.

Turnover on the staff for the year was less than for the similar
preceding fiscal period, due to the action of Congress in making pos-
sible on July 1, 1927, the first promotions under the efficiency ratings.
The Museum force has now become more stabilized, with resultant
improvement in morale.

Three employees left the service through the operation of the re-
tirement act: Columbus M. Sorrels, watchman, after 36 years’ serv-
ice; Robert Campbell, a laborer at the Museum for 33 years; and
Thomas Hamilton, laborer, after 23 years of service.

Miss Elizabeth Ward Lamon, principal clerk-stenographer in the
administrative office, after a Government service of 30 years, was
granted an indefinite furlough to permit her to regain lost health.

The Museum lost through death a number of important members
of its scientific staff, all of whom had been long associated with its
scientific work. Dr. Immanuel Moses Casanowicz, assistant curator
of Old World archeology, died September 26, 1927. Dr. Joseph
Nelson Rose, assistant curator of plants, died May 4, 1928. Mr.
Bradshaw Hall Swales, honorary assistant curator of birds, died on
January 23, 1928. Other losses by death included Mr. Joseph Mace,
who served the Museum as teamster for over 50 years; Bernard W.
Burdine, oiler, with 40 years of service; Samuel J. Lancaster, watch-
man, with 33 years of service; Carter E. Collins, laborer for 30 years;
Edwin J. Weiskoff, electrician for 17 years; Edgar Furbush, watch-
man for 6 years; and Frank Nash, laborer for 2 years.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 2
REPORT OF THE N ATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the affairs
of the National Gallery’of Art for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1928:

The urgent need of a national gallery building has been a chief
concern of the gallery staff and of the commission during the year.
The poverty of space for the installation of collections already in
hand and for the encouragement of gifts and bequests of art works,
the sources of our present riches, has interfered seriously with prog-
ress in any direction. It is to be hoped that this condition may soon
be remedied. Upward of a year ago it was announced in the public
press that, under certain suggested conditions, private funds would
become available for the erection of a building. There is naturally
less inclination in Congress to consider grants for art while the pros-
pect of private munificence for this purpose is thus definitely fore-
shadowed. Moreover, the project of a great group of buildings,
manifestly necessary to the public welfare and requiring vast ex-
penditure of the public funds, took shape about this time and is now
being carried forward with commendable vigor. It is thus apparent
that for the present the realization of the gallery’s hopes seems de-
pendent. on the generous response of public-spirited citizens to a
manifest need. Undue delay in the struggle for national art appears
as a great misfortune, since we are compelled to remain inactive
during a period of exceptional art activity and art production and
distribution, and in which the art treasures of the Old World are in
a state of unparalleled flux.

THE GALLERY COMMISSION

The art collections of the Institution, which accumulated slowly
during the last quarter of a century, and largely within the depart-
ment of anthropology of the National Museum, had, in 1920, grown
so in bulk that the Regents of the Institution found it advisable to
establish the National Gallery as a separate bureau of the Institution,
and a commission was appointed to consider its interests and promote
its welfare. This commission comprises 16 members—5 public men
interested in the fine arts, 5 experts in the fine arts, and 5 artists, the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY aa

Secretary of the Institution becoming a member ex officio. The
membership at present is as follows: W. K. Bixby, Joseph H. Gest,
Charles Moore, James Parmelee, Herbert L. Pratt, John E. Lodge,
Frank Jewett Mather, jr., Charles L. Borie, jr., Edward Willis Red-
field, James EK. Fraser, Edmund C. Tarbell, Daniel Chester French,
Herbert Adams, Gari Melchers, William H. Holmes, and C. G. Abbot,
ex officio.

The Regents’ plan provided for two or more meetings of the com-
mission per year, but it was soon found that a single meeting only
was necessary to look after the affairs and to consider the problems
of the gallery. Meetings were held annually beginning in 1921, and
their proceedings are recorded in the annual reports of the Smith-
sonian Institution.

The seventh annual meeting of the commission was held in the
Regents’ room of the Institution on December 6, 1927. The mem-
bers present were Gari Melchers, chairman; Frank J. Mather, jr.,
vice chairman; W. H. Holmes, secretary; Herbert Adams; James E.
Fraser; John E. Lodge; James Parmelee; E. W. Redfield; and C. G.
Abbot, Acting Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

The annual report of the secretary of the commission reviewing
the activities of the gallery for the calendar year 1927 was then
presented. There was wide discussion of various matters treated in
the report, especially (1) the question of the development of a
national portrait gallery as a separately conducted branch of the
gallery proper, and (2) the possible assemblage in the gallery at a
future date of the Ranger-fund purchases now tentatively held by
various galleries throughout the country, the National Gallery having
the privilege of claiming such of these works, now numbering up-
wards of 60, as it may choose, after the lapse of a certain period.
The purpose of the proposed assemblage is to enable the commission
to keep in touch with the growing collection and to make tentative
selection of such works as appear worthy of a place in the National
Gallery. On motion of Mr. Adams, it was resolved that in the sense
of the meeting it is desirable to hold such an exhibit of the Ranger
purchases. On motion, it was further resolved that the Secretary
of the Smithsonian Institution be invited to ask the Bureau of the
Budget to recommend an appropriation of $1,000 to meet the expenses
- of the proposed exhibition of the Ranger paintings.

The secretary presented a request of the National Press Club of
Washington for the loan of gallery paintings for the embellishment
of the club’s reception rooms and principal offices, and after discus-
sion, on motion of Mr. Mather, it was Resolved: That it is the policy
of the National Gallery of Art not to lend works of art of public
ownership to private institutions.

54 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

Following adjournment at noon the advisory committee visited the
gallery rooms in the National Museum Building to consider accept-
ance of offerings of art works for the year. The following were
accepted: (1) Seven water-color paintings of Greek Temples, by
Henry Bacon, designed to serve as a nucleus for a prospective archi-
tectural department in the gallery; (2) a three-quarters length
portrait of Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont, by Daniel Huntington,
for the National Portrait Gallery; and (3) portrait busts of Gen.
Winfield Scott and Wiliam Cullen Bryant, by Henry Kirke Brown,
for the Portrait Gallery.

THE HENRY WARD RANGER FUND PURCHASES

The paintings purchased during the year by the council of the
National Academy of Design from the fund provided by the Henry
Ward Ranger bequest, which are under certain conditions prospective
additions to the gallery collections, are as follows, including the
names of the institutions to which they have been assigned:

THE ALFRED DUANE PELL COLLECTION

Thirty-six pieces of porcelain were added to the Alfred Duane
Pell collection, already installed, by Mrs. Pell, Mr. Pell having died
March 6, 1924. The lot includes 10 superb pieces of pate-sur-pate
by Solon and 4 by his pupil, A. Birks; 6 pieces of charming Old
Worcester ware; 1 piece of the hitherto unrepresented New Hall
porcelain; 1 piece of Meissen from a set made for the King of Hol-
land; and examples of Capo di Monti, Doccia, and other Italian
porcelains. The pieces by Solon are of special interest in rounding
out the gallery’s exceptional representation of this great master’s
work.

THE GEORGE DUPONT PRATT GIFT

The Thomas Moran painting of the Grand Canyon of the Yellow-
stone which has been exhibited in the gallery for a number of years
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 55

as a loan, first by the artist and later by his daughter, Miss Ruth B.
Moran, has been added to the gallery’s permanent collections. In
May of the present year during a visit of Mr. Pratt to the gallery
he became deeply impressed with the national importance of this
great work, and soon after announced his willingness to contribute
$10,000 to its purchase. Miss Moran was so greatly pleased with
the prospect of having the picture become the property of the Nation,
thus retaining its place in the National Gallery, that she decided to
accept this amount. Moran may well be regarded as our. greatest
master of landscape, marvelously skilled with the pencil, the graver,
and the brush, and he was a colorist unsurpassed. After three visits
to the Yellowstone he chose this as the subject most worthy of his
crowning effort, and prepared the way for its realization by a multi-
tude of studies in pencil and water color. ‘The canvas finally chosen
was so large—8 by 14 feet—that it could not be accommodated in
his East Hampton studio and a near-by carpenter shop was utilized
for the purpose. The acquirement of this work is a triumph for the
National Gallery.

SPECIAL EXHIBITS HELD IN THE GALLERY

With the opening of the calendar year 1928 the gallery entered
upon a period of exceptiona] activity. Four important exhibits
followed one another in quick succession. The space required for
their installation was obtained by removing to storage the contents
of four of the main exhibition rooms of the gallery. This was made
less embarrassing by the withdrawal at the particular moment of the
McFadden collection of British old masters, which had occupied two
of the rooms for a number of years awaiting the completion of the
Philadelphia Museum of Art, in which institution they are destined
to find a permanent resting place.

THE OSTERMAN COLLECTION

It happened also at this time that the Henry Cleveland Perkins
collection of British and Dutch masters, exhibited for several years
in the northeast room of the gallery, was withdrawn, and in this room
the first of the series of exhibits, the remarkable collection of por-
traits with one figure subject, by Bernhard Osterman, of Stockholm,
Sweden, was installed. This exhibit, held under the patronage of
His Excellency, W. Bostrém, the Swedish minister in Washington,
was opened to the public January 11, a private view by special invi-
tation having been given on the 10th. An illustrated catalogue was
supplied by the artist, the foreword to which, by Christian Brinton,
is in part appropriately quoted in this place.
56 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

The present exhibition offers a comprehensive résumé of Mr. Bernhard
Osterman’s work. From the early likeness of the ascetic, intellectual Bishop
of Lund to the latest products of his brush you observe an increased mastery
of the approved elements of pictorial representation. For aristocratic restraint,
coupled with clearly realized individuality, special mention must be made of
the seated figure of His Majesty the King of Sweden. In sheer vigor of
characterization the standing three-quarter length of Herr von Stubenrauch,
late president of the Berlin police, occupies a position by itself in the artist’s
gallery of international celebrities.

It happened that this collection at the close of the exhibition, Janu-
ary 24, was not scheduled for exhibition elsewhere for the remainder
of the season and the artist consented to have it remain on view in
the gallery until the next exhibition season opens.

ANNUAL EXHIBITION OF THE SOCIETY OF WASHINGTON ARTISTS

Early in 1928 it became known that the Corcoran Gallery, due to
the erection of the W. A. Clark Annex and the installation of his
great collection, could not hold the accustomed annual exhibits of
the local art societies. A plea was made by the artists, who were
at a loss for accommodations, to the director of the National Gallery
who was glad to grant the request, although the granting implied
a very great crowding of the season’s exhibits. The annual exhibi-
tion of the Society of Washington Artists followed the Osterman
exhibit and was opened to the public February 4. The society
printed its usual catalogue, which listed 119 paintings and 11 works
of sculpture. The installation in the three available halls of the
gallery proved highly satisfactory to the society and the exhibit
met with marked public appreciation.

COLLECTION OF CONTEMPORARY BRITISH ART

The exhibit of the loca] society was followed by a most interesting
collection of paintings, 91 in number, by contemporary British
artists, which remained on view from March 5 through April 1.
The paintings were assembled in London by Miss Charlotte Pearson
with the approval of the president of the Royal Academy, who
named as an honorary committee the Earl of Balfour, K. G., the
Earl of Birkenhead, K. G., Sir Frederic G. Kenyon, G. B. E.,
and His Excellency the Hon. Alanson B. Houghton, ambassador
of the United States to Great Britain. The committee of selection
was composed of Robert Anning Bell, R. A., Sir D. Y. Cameron,
R. A., Sir George Clausen, R. A., Julius Olsson, R. A., and Miss Char-
lotte Pearson, secretary, who accompanied the collection to Wash-
ington, and at the close of its presentation here directed its transfer
to the Toronto Art Gallery, Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

The exhibit was held under the patronage of His Excellency Sir
Esme Howard, G. C. M. G., the British ambassador to the United
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 57

States, and was opened by a public reception tendered by the Board
of Regents of the Institution. The foreword of the catalogue, by
Sir Frederic G. Kenyon, G. B. E., was introduced by the following
lines:

The object of the present exhibition is to bring to the notice of the American
people some part of the contemporary work of the artists of Great Britain.
It has the support of many of its leading painters, and it is believed that it
may fairly claim to be representative of much of the best work that is being
done there to-day. Merely as an exhibition of art it is hoped that it has
attractiveness and merit.

ANNUAL EXHIBITION OF THE WASHINGTON WATER COLOR CLUB

The annual exhibition of the Washington Water Color Club fol-
lowed the British exhibit and closed the loan exhibition program for
the season. There were 226 exhibits—i85 in water colors and 41
etchings, block prints, and drawings. The result in this case, as in
that of the local oil exhibit, was highly satisfactory. The works
were well shown and the attendance was gratifying.

It may be stated in this place that it is not a definitely authorized
privilege of the gallery, which is a Government bureau, to entertain
displays for individuals or private organizations of which an essen-
tial feature is the privilege of making sales. The admission of the
exhibits of the two local societies was, as stated above, due to a serious
emergency that had arisen, and no objection has been raised.

THE JOHN ROSS KEY COLLECTION OF PAINTINGS

In January, 1927, the gallery accepted for temporary exhibition a
large collection of paintings by John Ross Key, mainly landscapes
of the near-by States but including a number of interesting canvases
representing colonial mansions of Washington and near-by Maryland
and Virginia. These latter paintings have much sentimental inter-
est aside from the subjects represented, being the handiwork of the
grandson of Francis Scott Key, the author of our Star-Spangled
Banner. At the close of the exhibition the owner, Mrs. Ellenore
Dutcher Key, was permitted to continue the exhibition for several
months beyond the stipulated period, and the collection is still held
in reserve at the close of the fiscal year 1928.

REINSTALLATION OF COLLECTIONS

At the close of the loan exhibition season in July, reinstallation of
the gallery collections, largely in storage, was taken up and given
very careful attention, so that the appearance of the gallery to-day
is more satisfactory and the collections more fully representative than
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

at any previous period. Paintings of the highest order of merit were
chosen, and overcrowding was avoided. Many works are, however,
held in reserve, but all of these are hung where they may be seen to
advantage by visitors desiring to examine them.

LABELING OF COLLECTIONS

Upward of 100 metal labels have been engraved and attached
to the frames of the paintings to which they belong. Aside from
these labels, all necessarily of small size, and limited to the simplest
essentials of record, framed labels giving fuller data are attached to
the background in close proximity to the pictures.

CARE OF COLLECTIONS

Requisite care has been given to all paintings with respect to repair,
restoration, varnishing, and glazing, there remaining unglazed only
four works which are of such large size that glass can not be intro-
duced. Three paintings requiring expert treatment, Man Wearing
a Large Hat, by Rembrandt; portraits of Lord Abercorn, by Law-
rence, and of Viscount Hill, by Reynolds, were intrusted to the
expert restorer of old masters, Mr. H. E. Thompson, of the Boston
Museum of Fine Arts, and have been returned to the gallery in an
entirely satisfactory state.

transfer to the National Gallery on approval of the advisory com-
mittee of the gallery commission, are as follows:

assigned to the gallery as a studio and workroom.

MISCELLANEOUS

The wall coverings of the gallery, the background for the paint-
ings and other art works, are a consideration of first importance.
The burlaps applied to the walls six years ago gradually faded to a
golden brown, giving a rich effect to the halls, but later changed to a
dull brown so somber that it was removed and replaced in part by
burlaps of a light-green tone, a little too positive but contrasting
agreeably with the warm tones of the paintings.

A number of burlap-covered screens for gallery use, a prime
necessity in accommodating overflow of exhibits, were added to the
already large supply. Four easels required for the display of paint-
ings of special note were added, besides one exhibition case of the
gem type, eight mahogany settees, and four pedestals for the installa-
tion of portrait busts. The gallery to-day is not crowded as here-
tofore and presents a more finished and restful appearance than at
any previous date. Oil paintings, 337 in number, and 82 drawings
in various mediums by French artists of note are shown to good ad-
vantage on folding screens in the south room, and 70 works worthy
of a place in the gallery are held in reserve to be utilized as oppor-
tunity occurs.

LIBRARY

The gallery library has added by gift, purchase, and subscription
1,096 numbers to its upward of 1,500 volumes, pamphlets, and peri-
odicals, and 12 water-color paintings by W. H. Holmes, gift of the
artist.
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

It was found possible to enlist the services of Miss Helen V. Barnes,
junior librarian, for a period of two months, to assist in the Smith-
sonian library as a return for work done in that library for the
gallery.

The work of the care and preservation of objects in the collec-

remounting of four Japanese screens, in addition to completing the
work on Japanese screen 01.173, which was begun in the spring of
1927. Twenty-two paintings in the American section have been
put in condition. Changes in exhibition during the year have
involved 168 different objects, itemized as follows:

63 Whistler etchings.

40 Whistler and other oil paintings.
11 Japanese screens.

6 Japanese lacquer and sculpture.
7 Japanese panels.

4 Chinese pottery.
28 Near Hastern paintings.

1 Indian sculpture.

6 Near Eastern pottery.

2 Siamese sculptures.

Two hundred and twenty-four objects have been submitted for an
expert opinion upon them, or for translation of their oriental inscrip-
tions. Thirty-four other translations of inscriptions have been made
from photographs submitted to the curator.

Additions to the library include 26 volumes, 28 periodicals, and 59
pamphlets. ‘The Chinese library of the eminent oriental scholar, the
late William Woodville Rockhill, which was presented by Mrs. Rock-
hill to the Smithsonian Institution in the autumn of 1927 and de-
posited in the Freer Gallery, forms an important addition to the
Chinese section of the library. The Rockhill collection comprises
1,100 volumes, ranging in date of publication from 1659 to 1913.
A list of the new accessions accompanies this report as Appendix A
(not printed).

The books of the field staff comprise a separate and movable unit
of the general reference library and are at present installed at the
gallery. The total number of volumes in this branch is 661; unbound
periodicals, 134; pamphlets, 489; catalogues, 36; and bulletins, 9.
Thirty-six volumes have been added during the current year. A
complete list of books in the field library accompanies this report
as Part II, Appendix A (not printed).

As noted in the report of last year, the demand for photographs
by special students and others is constantly increasing the store of
negatives. The total number of these is now 1,491, in addition to
829 negatives of Biblical MSS. A certain number of prints from
these negatives are always kept in stock to meet the popular demand;
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 65

others can be obtained upon order. The total number of sales of
reproductions are as follows: Photographs, 1,089; negatives, 2; a
rubbing from a Chinese stone relief, 1; lantern slides, 100; post cards,
2,017. All of the foregoing are sold at their cost prices.

The pamphlets issued by the gallery have been increased by a
“List of paintings, pastels, drawings, prints, and copper plates, by

THE BUILDING

The shop has been constantly occupied during the year with the
making of necessary stands, frames, and cases, general repair work,
and the fitting up of two additional workrooms, namely, an office for
the field staff and a room for operating the mimeograph and photo-
graph press. <A detailed report made by the superintendent is sub-
mitted herewith as Appendix C (not printed).

ATTENDANCE

The gallery has been open every day with the exception of Mon-
days, Christmas Day, and New Year’s Day, from 9 until 4.30 o’clock.
The total attendance for the year was 111,288. The aggregate Sun-
day attendance was 32,279, with an average of 620. The week-day
attendance amounted to 79,009, with an average of 305. It reached
its highest totals in the months between April and October, inclu-
sive. The total number of visitors to the office was 1.218. Of these,
171 came for general information; 48 to study the building and
museum methods; 64 to submit objects for examination ; 262 to see ob-
jects in storage; 221 to study in the library; 80 to see facsimiles of
the Washington MSS; 23 to make drawings; 4 to make photographs;
and 182 to purchase photographs. Thirty-three classes were given
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

instruction, four groups were given docent service in the galleries,
and two lectures were delivered in the auditorium, as follows:

February 25: Dr. Alfred Salmony, on “ Les Problémes de la Sculpture dans
les Indes Orientales.” Illustrated.

March 16: Mr. Carl W. Bishop, on “Archeological Research in China.”
Illustrated. The latter lecture was given under the combined auspices of the
Archeological Society of Washington and the Art and Archeology League.

This report marks the close of the fifth year of the Freer Gallery
as an institution open to the uses of the public. During these years

the total attendance has been fairly constant, that of the first year
reaching 111,942; that of the fifth year, 111,288. The Sunday at-
tendance has noticeably increased, being slightly more than twice as
great as week-day attendance during the past year. Figure 1 indi-
cates in graphic form the total and average attendance since the
gallery was first opened to the public.

Last winter for the space of a month a record was kept of the
average length of time spent by visitors in the exhibition galleries.
During the time that this observation was being made the longest
visit lasted 2 hours and 45 minutes; the shortest, 11 minutes. Fig-
ure 2 indicates the average stay.

While the above records give some indication of the response of the
general public to the exhibitions, another survey indicates the demand
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 67

made upon the inner resources of the gallery by that smaller section
of the public which has an especial interest in the field of art rep-
resented in the collections. It is interesting to note the steady
growth of this group with its demands analyzed in Figure 3.

FIELD WORK

Owing in part to conditions in China and in part to the large
amount of material already secured for study, Mr. C. W. Bishop, as-
sociate curator, was, as stated in the report for last year, temporarily
recalled to the gallery. He traveled by way of Egypt and the prin-
cipal western European countries, where he visited collections and
sites of importance and held discussions with a number of promi-
nent archeologists. Since his arrival in Washington he has been en-
gaged principally in working up the material collected during his
four years and a half in the field.

FIGURE 2

Dr. C. Li and Mr. K. Z. Tung, the Chinese members of the field
staff, were left in China in order to maintain the contacts already
established with various Chinese scientific bodies and to prepare the
way for further field work at an early date. In both these tasks they
have achieved gratifying success. Negotiations are at present being
conducted with the newly-founded bureau of scientific research, an
organization whose character and aims correspond somewhat closely
to those of the Smithsonian Institution, for cooperation in archeo-
logical investigation.

Karly in the present summer Doctor Li was called to the gallery
to discuss future field work and to complete, with the aid of the facil-
ities now available in Washington, his report on his excavations in
southwestern Shansi Provinee. He plans, upon his return to China,
to establish a field station as a semipermanent base of operations, thus
permitting the uninterrupted prosecution of excavation for much
longer periods.

REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sir: The following report on the field researches, office work, and
other operations of the Bureau of American Ethnology during the
fiscal year ended June 30, 1928, is herewith submitted. ‘This work
was conducted in accordance with the act of Congress approved
February 11, 1927, which contains the following item:

American ethnology: For continuing ethnological researches among the Ameri-
can Indians and the natives of Hawaii, the excavation and preservation of
archeologic remains under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, includ-
ing necessary employees, the preparation of manuscripts, drawings, and illustra-
tions, the purchase of books and periodicals, and traveling expenses, $58,720,
of which amount not to exceed $48,000 may be expended for personal services in
the District of Columbia.

Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, chief of the bureau since March 1, 1918,
continued to occupy that position until January 15, 1928, when he
retired as chief but continued on the staff of the bureau as associate
anthropologist.

The general program of the bureau for the entire year has been
similar to that of the last fiscal year.

Doctor Fewkes’s scientific work has been mainly devoted to the
preparation of a report on his excavations at Elden Pueblo, Ariz.,
made during the summer of 1926.

Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, completed the proof reading
of his papers on the Social Organization and Social Usages of the
Indians of the Creek Confederacy, the Religious Beliefs and Medical
Practices of the Creek Indians, The Culture of the Southeast, and
a paper by the late William E. Myer on Trails of the Southeast, all
of which have appeared in the forty-second annual report of the
bureau, and of a short paper on the Social and Religious Usages
of the Chickasaw Indians which is to appear in the forty-fourth
annual report. He spent some time in continuing the preparation
of a tribal map of aboriginal North America north of Mexico and
the text accompanying, and assisted in the preparation for publica-
tion of James Mooney’s paper on The Aboriginal Population of
America North of Mexico, which appeared as volume 80, No. 7, of
the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.

Work in connection with the Timucua dictionary, with the help
of Miss Tucker, was continued during most of the year. In 1926,

70
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY rah

Miss Irene Wright, in the employ of the Florida State Historical
Society, discovered a letter in the archives of the Indies at Sevilla
written in the Timucua language. Part of the work of preparing
this material for publication by the society has been done by Doctor
Swanton, and in the same volume an earlier letter, discovered and
published by Buckingham Smith is to be included. Although this
publication is being done outside, it will furnish in more convenient
and reliable form all of the known material which we have not yet
drawn upon for the dictionary, some scattered words alone excepted.
Doctor Swanton has been called upon for an unusual amount of
advisory and other special work during the past year.

From July 1 to 22 Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist, continued
ethnological and linguistic work among the Sauk and Fox of Iowa.
From the latter part of July to the end of August he was engaged
in work on the Northern Arapaho, devoting his time mainly to
linguistics, and was able to unravel a number of complex phonetic
shifts whereby a larger proportion of Algonquian elements in the
language were made more certain than hitherto suspected. He also
took physical measurements of a number of Arapaho and Shoshoni
Indians. As far as the latter is concerned, the cephalic index of
his series agrees closely with that obtained under the direction of
Doctor Boas more than 20 years ago. After his return to Washington,
September 1, he corrected the proofs of his notes on the buffalo-
head dance of the thunder gens of the Fox Indians, which will appear
as Bulletin 87 of the bureau.

Doctor Michelson submitted for publication a work entitled “ Ob-
servations on the Thunder Dance of the Bear Gens of the Fox
Indians,” which is to be issued as Bulletin 89 of the bureau. He has
also submitted a manuscript designated “Sketch of the Buffalo
Dance of the Bear Gens of the Fox Indians.” He worked out a
complete translation of a syllabic text supplementary to his paper in
the fortieth annual report. A number of technical papers have
been prepared by Doctor Michelson and published in various scien-
tific journals. Doctor Michelson from time to time has furnished
data to answer official correspondence.

Mr. J. P. Harrington, ethnologist, spent the year in a study of the
Mission Indians of the Santa Barbara region of California and of
the Taos Tribe of north-central New Mexico.

Leaving for the field in the fall of 1927, Mr. Harrington resumed
his field studies at Santa Barbara with great success, securing a
mass of important linguistic information from the last few aged
survivors of the proud and highly cultured people which only a few
decades ago thickly populated the islands and mainland coasts of the
Santa Barbara region. The material covered the entire range of
knowledge of the informants and included difficult translations into
72 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

the Chumashan. These translations now include an almost exhaustive
study of the earlier period of Chumashan history. The grammatical
material was all perfectly heard and reaches into every corner of
phonetic phenomena and grammatical construction. The work con-
tains a new and exhaustive study of the early voyages, proving,
among other points that will have great popular interest, that Cabrillo
was the discoverer of Monterrey. It also contains translations made
by Mr. Harrington of the diaries of the early land expeditions,
throwing new light on hitherto dark chapters of the earliest history
of Alta California, since this history is here for the first time dealt
with from the Indian viewpoint. In this work Mr. Harrington has
cooperated with Fr. Zephyrin Engelhardt, custodian of the Santa
Barbara Mission archives, and with Dr. H. E. Bolton and other
friends at the Bancroft Library of the University of California.

Returning to Washington in March, Mr. Harrington elaborated
his recent notes and prepared his Taos material for publication.
This consists of a thorough presentation of the documents of Taos
Indian history, all of them worked through afresh and provided with
new original translations by Mr. Harrington, a presentation of Taos
ethnology, and a comprehensive vocabulary of the Taos language,
which, as Mr. Harrington has recently pointed out, has close genetic
relationship with the Kiowa language.

At the beginning of the fiscal year 1928 Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt,
ethnologist, undertook a detailed study and interpretation of certain
Onondaga Iroquoian texts recorded by him in former years relating
to the wind or air gods, who are in fact disease gods of Iroquoian
mythic thought. These texts are Delphic in their brevity, and so
are most difficult to interpret and to correlate. They are only brief
myths, most of the details of which have been forgotten, and so the
mode of telling them has become oracular.

Mr. Hewitt read the galley proof of his paper in the forty-third
annual report of the bureau, Iroquoian Cosmology, Second Part.
Severe illness during the early winter delayed this work, but upon
partial recovery he completed this task and also the final reading in
page proofs.

Mr. Hewitt also edited Mr. Edwin Thompson Denig’s manuscript,
Report on the Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri to the Hon. Isaac
H. Stevens, Governor of Washington Territory. He added an intro-
duction to the report, with a brief biography of the author.

As the representative of the Smithsonian Institution on the United
States Geographic Board, Mr. Hewitt attended the meetings of the
board and of the executive committee of that board, of which he is
also a member.

As custodian of the bureau manuscripts, Mr. Hewitt reports the
continuation of the work of recataloguing the manuscript material
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 73

and the phonograph music records belonging to the archives. Miss
M. W. Tucker typed the cards and stored the material, and also cata-
logued 250 cylinders of the Osage Indian songs and rituals. These
were verified by Doctor LaFlesche with the use of the phonograph,
and are therefore authentic. Mr. Harrington has also turned over
his collection of 100 cylinders. Miss Densmore has, to date, a total of
1,697 cylinders listed and filed.

There are now 3,079 manuscripts in the archives, and about 626
phonograph records, in addition to those of Miss Densmore.

On May 18, 1928, Mr. Hewitt left Washington to continue his
studies among the Iroquoian and Chippewa tribes in Canada. He
visited the Chippewa at Garden River to revise certain cosmic texts
acquired in 1900 from Mr. John Miscogeon, of Bay View, Mich., and
from Mr. George Gabaoosa, of Garden River, in 1921. He also
visited the Huron remnant at Loretteville, near the city of Quebec,
Canada, to ascertain whether any knowledge of an institution re-
sembling closely the League of the Five Iroquois Tribes formerly
extant among the Hurons then dwelling about Lake Simcoe still
existed among this remnant of the Hurons. But no remembrance of
it was found.

He also visited the Caughnawaga Mohawk living near Montreal,
where information regarding the league and its institutions was
sought, but he found only a jumble of ideas coming from the old
religious thought of the natives, from the so-called Handsome Lake
reformation, and from the hazy ideas instilled into them by the
missionaries. Here Mr. Hewitt also sought information tending to
identify the so-called Seven Nations of Canada, etc., who have re-
cently become a problem for the Canadian Department of Justice
and of the law department at Albany, N. Y.

Mr. Hewitt’s most fruitful field of research was among the Six
Nations of Iroquois living on the Grand River grant not far from
Brantford, Canada. Here he undertook the free translation of the
historical tradition of the founding of the League of the Five Iro-
quois Tribes in the closing decades of the sixteenth century, as related
by the Mohawk and the Onondaga, which embodies the farewell
address of Deganawide, the master mind in the work of establishing
that institution. He also revised the seven myths in native Onon-
daga texts relating to the gods of the air and the wind who control
diseases.

He also was fortunate enough to secure the emblem of official
authority of the fire keeper of the council of the league to open and
to close the sessions of the council.

Mr. Hewitt, as usual, has devoted much time to providing, through
careful research, data for replies to the many correspondents of the
bureau.
74 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

During the fiscal year ended June 30, 1928, Dr. Francis LaFlesche,
ethnologist, completed two manuscripts: Wa-sha-be A-thi*, contain-
ing 270 pages, and Wa-wa-tho", or Pipe Ceremony, containing 110
pages. Another manuscript is in the hands of the editor, entitled
“The Child-Naming Ritual.”

He started a dictionary of the Omaha language, obtaining about
7,000 words with both the Indian and the English meaning and
usage. In November he began the compilation of a dictionary of the
Osage language. About 20,000 words with their full meanings and
’ usage have been completed.

The month of July, 1927, and the first part of August were spent
by Dr. F. H. H. Roberts, jr., archeologist, in the Chaco Canyon,
N. Mex., completing the excavation of a late basket-maker site.
It was discovered that the latter had been a village consisting of 18
houses, a kiva or circular ceremonial structure; 48 storage bins; and
a court. Definite knowledge of the house type was obtained during
the progress of these excavations, as well as other information of
value concerning one of the lesser known stages in the cultural de-
velopment of the sedentary, agricultural Indians of the prehistoric
Southwest. The work in the Chaco added materially to the infor-
mation on southwestern archeology.

Two weeks of August were spent in southeastern Utah in a recon-
naissance along Montezuma Creek, one of the northern tributaries
of the San Juan. The purpose of this reconnaissance was to locate
additional late basket-maker sites which might warrant intensive
investigation. Despite heavy rains and flooded conditions of the
streams, he was able to make his way up Montezuma Creek a dis-
tance of 40 miles. Several late basket-maker sites were observed,
but in every case the remains were so eroded that it was not deemed
advisable to do any excavating. Several ruins were visited which
were of interest because they had been noted and described by W. H.
Jackson in the Hayden survey report for Colorado and adjacent ter-
ritory, 1876. Although unique from an architectural standpoint, the
ruins belong to the late Mesa Verde era, the period when the pottery
characteristic of the large Mesa Verde pueblos and cliff dwellings
was in vogue.

At the end of August Doctor Roberts went to Pecos, N. Mex.,
where he attended the conference of southwestern archeologists and
ethnologists held at the Pecos ruins, where the Andover Academy
expedition under Dr. A. V. Kidder was completing its extensive
investigations of that well-known pueblo. While at the conference
he assisted in the drafting of a new outline of the sequence of cul-
tural stages in southwestern prehistoric and early historic develop-
ment of the sedentary Indian groups.
~

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY (5,

The first week in September found him at Folsom, N. Mex., where
workmen of the Colorado Museum of Natural History, Denver, had
uncovered several projectile points in direct association with the
bones of an extinct species of bison, Bison taylori. Several days
were spent in investigating the fossil bed and the surrounding terri-
tory. Doctor Roberts was so impressed with the find that he sent for
Dr. A. V. Kidder, of the Andover Academy and the Carnegie Insti-
tution of Washington, and with him again went carefully over the
problem presented. At the conclusion of the investigations Doctor
Roberts and Doctor Kidder were convinced that the bones and the
projectile points had been deposited in the stratum contem-
poraneously. He returned to Washington early in October.

The winter was spent in the preparation of a manuscript on the
season’s work, entitled “ Shabikeshchee Village, a Late Basket-Maker
Site in the Chaco Canyon, New Mexico.” Another manuscript
entitled “ Recent Archeological Developments in the Vicinity of
El Paso, Tex.,” was also completed.

In February Doctor Roberts went to Melbourne, I'la., to view, in
situ, a projectile point which Dr. J. W. Gidley, of the United States
National Museum, had found in a stratum from which he was remoy-
ing the bones of extinct Pleistocene animals. The projectile point
and bones were from the same stratum which in previous work had
yielded the crushed skull of a human being. It is around the latter
that much anthropological and paleontological discussion has centered
during the last two years. Doctor Roberts took advantage of the
trip to Melbourne to visit a number of shell heaps and mounds left
by some of the earlier Indian inhabitants of the region.

In May, 1928, Doctor Roberts made a reconnaissance along the
San Juan River to a point about 10 miles south of Rosa, N. Mex.
Returning to Arboles, Colo., a short survey and inspection was made
of the ruins and ruin sites along the Piedra River, one of the larger
tributaries of the San Juan. As a result of the latter it was deter-
mined to excavate a site located on a bluff 100 feet above the river
on the east side of the Piedra 15 miles north of Arboles.

The month of June was spent in an intensive investigation of the
above site, which proved to be a Pueblo I village. Of the 24 houses
excavated, 21 were single-room structures. Of the remaining 3, 2
had been 2-room domiciles, while the third had contained three
cell-like rooms. It was found that the structures varied considerably
in size, some of them being but 5 to 6 feet square, while others were
25 to 30 feet in length by 6 to 9 feet in width, but all had been
constructed in the same manner. In most cases there had been a
shght excavation measuring from 6 inches to 1 foot in depth. This
pit portion of the dwelling, if the slight excavation may be so called,
76 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

was roughly rectangular in shape. At an average distance of 10
inches from each corner a large post had been set in the floor. These
four posts appear to have carried at their tops a rectangular frame-
work, which formed the support for the roof and walls.. Both the
roof and walis had had a framework of small poles, which was
covered with adobe plaster averaging 6 inches in thickness. The roof
proper seems to have been flat, while the walls had a slight slope due
to the fact that the poles which formed them had had their lower
ends embedded in the earth around the edges of the shallow pit, while
their upper ends leaned against the framework at the tops of the
large support posts. In most cases the rooms were entered by means
of a small doorway in the center of one of the side walls. One or
two of the structures gave the suggestion of a roof entrance. In all
cases the doorway seems to have had a large stone slab for a cover.

There seems to have been a definite method of grouping the houses,
from four to eight or more of them being grouped in a semicircle:
around a circular depression. ‘Two of these depressions were exca-
vated and two more were trenched in the hope that they might be
found to contain kivas or ceremonial rooms, but in all four cases
they were found to be nothing more than pits. It is quite possible
that the earth used in making the plaster to cover the wooden frame-
work of the structures was taken out of these pits; possibly the
plaster itself was mixed there, while the hole remained to serve as a
reservoir for the storing of water. In each case the lower portions
of the pits gave distinct evidence of having been filled with water.

Refuse mounds containing burials were found in most cases to lie
some distance south or southeast of the house clusters. The burials
were of the contracted form, the body being placed in the shallow
grave with the knees drawn up to the breast and the lower limbs
tightly fiexed to the upper. Accompanying each burial were two
or three pottery vessels as mortuary offerings.

A good collection of pottery and other specimens was secured
from the houses and graves.

An interesting sidelight on the village is that it was destroyed by
fire, presumably in the fall or early winter, as practically every
vessel found in the structures contained corn, beans, wild cherries,
or some other form of vegetal food. It appears that very little of
the harvest had been used when through some mischance or other the
village was devastated by flames. Two of the inhabitants were
trapped in the houses, as the findings of the skeletons on the floor
would indicate. In both instances the remaining fragments of bone
showed clearly the marks of fire, and there was every evidence to
show that the bodies had been consumed in the flames.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY Tin
SPECIAL RESEARCHES

Research in the music of the American Indians has been carried
forward during the past year by Miss Frances Densmore, a collab-
orator of the bureau. In October, 1927, Miss Densmore visited the
Winnebago in Wisconsin, recording songs and interviewing many
Indians within a radius of about 20 miles around Black River Falls.
Eighty-three songs were recorded, with data concerning their origin
and use, and the singers and their environment were photographed.
The winter feast (also known as the war-bundle feast) and the
buffalo dance received special consideration, as these are distinc-
tively Winnebago ceremonies. Twenty-five winter feast songs were
recorded, including those of the night spirit, morning star, sun,
bear, and thunderbird bundles. The songs were recorded and infor-
mation given by men who habitually attend this feast, given annually
in Wisconsin and Nebraska. The use of music in the treatment of the
sick was found to be similar to that of the Chippewa and, in some
respects, to that of other tribes. The principal informant on this
subject was John Henry, living at Trempeleau, who recorded the
songs used by his grandfather when treating the sick. Additional
old healing songs included those formerly used by a Winnebago
named Thunder and recorded by his sons. Herb remedies were
administered and songs sung to make them effective.

Among the war songs is a group composed by members of the
tribe when serving in France with the United States Army during
the recent war. These express a high patriotism and are interesting
examples of songs composed by several persons in collaboration.
This is a phase of musical composition which has been observed
among the Sioux and Makah, as well as among Indians of British
Columbia. Other classes of recorded Winnebago songs are those of
the Heroka (bow and arrow spirits), songs to calm the waves, songs
received in dreams, and songs of the moccasin game.

One purpose of the work among the Winnebago was to ascertain
whether their songs resembled those of the neighboring Chippewa
or the related Sioux. The songs show a distinct resemblance to the
Chippewa and to the Menominee. Each tribe has its own songs,
and exceedingly old songs of each tribe have been obtained, but
there is a general resemblance in the melodic trend.

The study of material obtained at Neah Bay, Wash., and in
British Columbia in 1926, as well as Menominee material obtained in
1925, was continued, together with the work on Winnebago songs.
Eight manuscripts were submitted with the following titles: “ Dance
and dream songs of the Makah and Clayoquot Indians”; ‘“ Miscel-
laneous Makah and Clayoquot songs and Makah customs”; “ Nitinat
war and dance songs and Menominee songs connected with stories
78 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

of Manabus, with catalogue numbers of 184 songs”; “Songs of
Nitinat medicine men and miscellaneous Nitinat songs, with catalogue
numbers of Nitinat songs”; “ Songs of Indians living on the Fraser
and Thompson Rivers in British Columbia”; “Winnebago songs
of the Winter Feast”; “ Winnebago songs used in the treatment of
the sick”; and “ Winnebago war songs, with catalogue numbers of
Winnebago songs.”

The paper on Makah customs includes a consideration of such
topics as the construction of houses and canoes, tools, rope, clothing,
fishing, cooking, tatooing, and wedding customs, also methods of
making observations of the sun, and beliefs concerning petitions for
supernatural help.

Early in June, 1928, Mr. H. Hughes, of Ono, Russell County, Ky.,
advised the Smithsonian Institution of certain Indian objects re-
cently exhumed from a cave in the bluffs bordering Wolf Creek, a
branch of Cumberland River. To examine these objects and the
scene of their discovery, Mr. Neil M. Judd, curator of American
archeology, United States National Museum, was directed to proceed
to Ono.

Accompanied by Mr. Hughes, Mr. Judd called upon the three gen-
tlemen concerned with the discovery of the material in question,
examined the specimens, and later visited the shallow cave from
which they had been removed. The collection included parts of three
skeletons—two adults and an adolescent—a fragment of a buckskin
head band with fiber ropes attached, fragments of an olivella shell
necklace, a covered basket, and portions of two others. The basket,
certainly the most important of the several items, was woven of split
reeds; it is about 20 inches long, 8 inches wide, and 8 inches deep,
and was provided with a cover of approximately equal size that fitted
completely over the container. The basket is doubtless of Cherokee
origin; pottery fragments found in the cave tend to confirm this
deduction.

Owing to the fact that the site of discovery is only a shallow shelter
in a thick stratum of disintegrating shale, it is truly remarkable that
these textile fragments should have been so well preserved. Layers
of burned clay and ash indicated frequent though intermittent use
of the shelter by Indian peoples. Fragments of corncobs, one small
red bean, gourd rind, and squash seeds were observed among the
shaly deposits covering the narrow floor space.

During the summer and early fall of 1927 archeological investiga-
tions for the Bureau of American Ethnology were continued by Mr.
H. W. Krieger, curator of ethnology, United States National Museum,
in the arid section of the Columbia Basin and in the lower valley
of Snake River. During the preceding year the region extending
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 79

from the mouth of the Yakima River to the Canadian border was
explored. During the season of 1927 exploration of archeological
sites was continued from the mouth of the Yakima River to Mosier,
Oreg., in the vicinity of The Dalles. At this point an appreciable
increase in rainfall and forest growth marks the dividing line between
the humid northwest coast and the arid plateau of the interior.

In most essentials the early occupants of the upper plateau
possessed a remarkably uniform culture. It was found that the sub-
culture arex of north-central Oregon appears to be distinguished by
the excellent chipping of weapon points and tools from obsidian,
jasper, agate, and chalcedony. ‘The subarea of The Dalles and Miller
Island, the so-called “ Dalles culture,” is characterized to a greater
degree than is the subarea of north-central Oregon by realistically
shaped animal and human figurines executed in stone and wood and
appearing on wooden combs, stone pestle heads, stone bowls, and as
stone plaques. The subarea of The Dalles is also unique in the
possession of a lozenge or ovoid-shape stone knife with beveled lateral
surfaces shaped by rubbing. This type of knife was found in
abundance at Lyle, Wash. In the Snake River Valley a form of bone
or horn knife supplants the knife of chipped stone which prevails
elsewhere in the Columbia Basin, except in the areas mentioned.

Materials used as tools or as media on which to execute art designs
are characteristic of very restricted localities and vary in many
instances from village to village. The distinctions are the more
clear cut the more ancient the site and the more free the area from
the influence of contiguous culture areas.

At Page, Wash., on the Snake River, about 20 miles from Pasco,
were noted definite departures from the general type of archeological
remains characteristic of the sites along the Columbia River. No
copper ornaments or other objects of metal were found; nor were
any objects uncovered, other than dentalium shell, that might indi-
cate intercourse with British Columbia or with the tribes of the
lower Columbia. Bone knives and scrapers here displaced those of
chipped stone; weaving implements and perforators were of antler
or bone instead of rubbed stone as on the Columbia. Pairs of sand-
stone arrow-shaft rasps; fine-grained, grooved stone polishers; bas-
ketry fragments, showing styles of false embroidery, lattice weave,
and simple coiling and twining; ovoid stone clubs; and burials either
with red paint or of the usual cremation group type—all these char-
acteristics indicate a subculture area transitional between the Sho-
shoni on the east and south and the Shahaptian tribes of the middle
Columbia Basin.

The type of early culture that existed within the arid sections of
the Columbia Basin has. become definitely established. Many of the
connecting culture and trade relationships are now known. The re-
80 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

lationship with the Shoshoni and with other cultures on the south,
those of the basket maker and the pueblo, is not yet clearly defined.
Further research along the Snake River and its tributaries in south-
ern Idaho, northern Utah, and Nevada will no doubt bring out addi-
tional evidence of relationships with the preagricultural peoples of
the Southwest.

Mr. Henry B. Collins, jr., assistant curator of ethnology, and Mr.
T. Dale Stewart, of the division of physical anthropology, United
States National Museum, were detailed to conduct field work along
the coast of western Alaska, including the island of Nunivak, for
the purpose of observing these people, their manner of life, and their
physical type, as well as to collect skeletal and cultural material from
inhabited, and abandoned villages. From the standpoint of the
anthropologist, the section of Alaska from Bristol Bay northward
along the coast to the mouth of the Yukon is one of much interest,
for here dwell the most primitive group of Eskimo to be found in all
of Alaska. The work was conducted under the auspices of the
Bureau of American Ethnology, the United States National Museum,
the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and the
American Council of Learned Societies.

Transportation to Nunivak Island was obtained on the U. S. S.
Boxer, through the courtesy of the Federal Bureau of Education,
which operates this boat in the interest of the native schools it main-
tains throughout Alaska. The Boxer stopped at Unalaska, Akutan,
and Ugashik on the Aleutian Islands and the Alaska Peninsula, and
later at Kanakanak on the upper part of Bristol Bay.

Leaving Bristol Bay, the journey was continued northward along
the coast, stopping at Kukukak, Togiak, Mumtrack, and Tanunuk.
The Eskimo here live in small villages, usually along the coast near
the mouth of a stream. They subsist principally on fish, seal, and
birds, together with berries and a few other native plants. The most
important item of their clothing is the parka, a long coatlike gar-
ment made of feathers or fur. Their dwellings are semisubterra-
nean, consisting of a square or octagonal excavation from 1 to 3
feet deep, with walls and roof built up of successive tiers of drift-
wood logs, for there is no timber anywhere along the coast north of
Bristol Bay. The outside is completely covered with sod.

For winter travel the Eskimo use sleds and dog teams, while in
summer most of their journeys are made in the kayak, the in-
geniously made skin boat so typical of the Eskimo everywhere.

On June 21 Mr. Collins and Mr. Stewart landed at Nash Harbor
on the northwestern end of Nunivak Island, 48 days after leaving
Seattle. Here at the small native village of Kligachimiuny is located
the school of the Bureau of Education. Nunivak Island is 70 miles
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 81

long and about 45 miles wide, but there are no dependable charts of
its shores except for two restricted localities.

While very little was definitely known of them, the Nunivak Eskimo
have long been regarded as the most primitive in this remote region.
This was found to be true. Women were found still wearing the lip,
ear, and nose ornaments of beads and walrus ivory that were given
up years ago by the other Eskimo of western Alaska. The elaborate
observances and ceremonies relating to the hunting of the seal, and
their social and religious life in general, furnish additional evidence
of the extreme conservatism of these people.

The first work accomplished at Nash Harbor was the taking of
measurements and physiological observations on the natives. Much
of the western end of the island was explored on foot, bones and
ethnological material being collected from several deserted villages
and finally from the village at Nash Harbor. After completion of the
work on the western end of the island, camp was removed to Amo-
lowikimiut, a native village at Camp [tolin, some 30 miles to the east.

In August the party left Nunivak Island, Mr. Stewart going to St.
Michael with the trader from Tanunuk village, Nelson Island, while
Mr. Collins stopped at Hooper Bay, an Eskimo village on the main-
land between Nunivak and the Yukon, where additional collections
were secured. From St. Michael the outward trip was made up the
Yukon to Nenana, and thence to the coast to Seward, affording an
opportunity to observe the Eskimo along the lower Yukon and later
the Tinné Indians farther up the river.

The development and printing of all photographic work was done
in the laboratory of the United States National Museum by Dr. A. J.
Olmsted in cooperation with the bureau in exchange for work done
by Mr. Gill for other branches of the Institution. This arrangement,
as in the previous year, has proved eminently satisfactory.

LIBRARY

The reference library has continued under the care of Miss Ella
Leary, librarian, assisted by Mr. Thomas Blackwell. The library con-
sists of 27,921 volumes, about 16,177 pamphlets, and several thousand
unbound periodicals. During the year 780 books were accessioned, of
which 115 were acquired by purchase and 665 by gift and exchange;
also 3,980 serials, chiefly the publications of learned societies, were
received and recorded, of which only 108 were obtained by purchase,
the remainder being received through exchange. A considerable
amount of time was given to preparing bibliographic lists for corre-
spondents. Requisition was made on the Library of Congress during
the year for an aggregate of 325 volumes for official use. An increas-
ing number of students not connected with the Smithsonian Institu-
tion found the library of service in consulting volumes not obtainable
in other libraries.

APPENDIX 5
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the
operations of the International Exchange Service during the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1928:

An appropriation was made by Congress for the support of the
system of international exchanges between the United States and
foreign countries under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution
for the fiscal year 1928 of $46,855, an increase of $595 over the appro-
priation for the preceding year. This increase in the amount made
available for the service was to enable the Institution to advance to
the next step in their respective grades such of the exchange em-
ployees as were eligible for promotion. In addition to the above,
$300 was allotted for printing and binding. The repayments from
departmental and other establishments aggregated $5,083.14, making
the total resources available for exchange purposes during the year,
$52,238.14.

The total number of packages passing through the service was
542,223, a decrease from the number for the preceding year of 48,656.
This falling off in the number of packages handled was expected.
However, it does not signify that the normal work of the office has
slackened to any extent, as the number of packages. passing through
the service during the preceding fiscal year was the largest since its
organization in 1850—the increase being over a hundred thousand
packages, while the annual increase usually averages five or ten
thousand. The increase in that year was due in great measure, as was
explained in last year’s report, to the action of the Department of
Agriculture in turning over to the exchange office large numbers of
small packages for distribution abroad that it formerly transmitted
through the mails. That department later discontinued sending the
material in question to the Institution.

The total weight of the packages was 594,121 pounds—a gain of
40,996 over the weight of those handled during the preceding twelve
months.

In a letter to the American legation in Peking regarding the inter-
change of governmental documents between China and the United
States the Metropolitan Library in Peking, which in 1926 was desig-
nated by the Chinese Government as the depository library for all
official publications of foreign governments received by China
through the International Exchange Service, makes the following
statement :

Special mention should be made of the monthly consignments of govern-
mental documents received from the Smithsonian Institution. The Metropolitan
Library maintains a reference card catalogue containing genera] and specific
information concerning these publications and endeavors to furnish informa-
tion to inquirers, either in person or by mail, involving the material over which
it has custody.

The official publications of the United States forwarded to China previous
to 1926 were scattered in different places. The Library of the Foreign Office,
Peking; the Library of the Science Society, Nanking; and the Library of the
Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai, are the three places where a portion of these
publications are kept. It is hoped that these publications will eventually be
concentrated in one large library where a complete file is available for refer-
ence and research.

The Metropolitan Library further adds in its letter to the legation:

In writing to the Department of State will you be good enough to convey our
high appreciation of the efficient service which the Smithsonian Institution has
been rendering to the Metropolitan Library.

The Smithsonian occasionally receives letters from its correspond-
ents testifying to the usefulness of the International Exchange Serv-
ice and expressing appreciation of the help rendered in diffusing
knowledge by distributing scientific and literary publications.
Among such communications received during the past year was one
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 87

from Mr. George S. Godard, Connecticut State librarian. A part of
that letter is given below:

Every time I make a call at your department I am the more impressed with
the most important service you and those associated with you in the Inter-
national Exchange Service are rendering to the several States, institutions, and
others scattered throughout the civilized earth.

As a representative of the State of Connecticut in charge of the State, na-
tional, and internAtional exchanges of Connecticut, I wish to again express my
thanks for the services you have rendered the good State of Connecticut both
in forwarding to others and sending to us.

Another correspondent, the Minister of Guatemala, states that:

It is my privilege to express to the Institution the sincere thanks of the Gov-
ernment of Guatemala for the interest manifested by the useful and abundant
material furnished.

As an example of aid rendered by the International Exchange Serv-
ice in securing publications on some particular subject, a request was
received from a correspondent in London for information as to what
America has done toward the important subject of enacting laws to
provide for compulsory automobile liability insurance, and the In-
stitution succeeded in procuring quite a number of publications on
the subject. In acknowledging their receipt, the correspondent wrote
in part as follows:

I have not up to the present time had the opportunity of reading more than
a few of the publications sent to me, but I should like to tender you my very
sincere thanks for sending me all the reports desired and in addition many
other highly interesting articles. I assure you I appreciate your action very
much indeed.

There were shipped abroad during the year 2,872 boxes, being an
increase of 264 over the number for the preceding year. Of the total
number of boxes sent abroad 643 contained full sets of United States
official documents for foreign depositories and 2,229 included depart-
mental and other publications for the depositories of partial sets and
for miscellaneous correspondents.

Occasionally, as explained in previous reports, it is found more
economical to forward packages direct to their destinations by mail
than to transmit them in boxes by freight. In addition, quite a num-
ber of packages are sent by mail to remote places which can not be
reached through the existing agencies. During the year the number
of packages thus forwarded was 47,851.

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTAL DOCUMENTS

The number of sets of United States official documents forwarded
abroad to certain designated depositories is 105, an increase of 2
during the year—Burma and Bombay having been added to the list
of those countries receiving partial sets. The partial set of govern-
mental documents which has been sent to Rumania since 1903 has
been increased to a full set.

Shipments of governmental documents to Turkey, which were sus-
pended at the beginning of the World War, have been resumed, the
Turkish Government having designated the Ministry of Public
Instruction at Angora as the depository.

At the request of the Government of Yugoslavia, the depository of
the full set of official documents in that country has been changed
from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to the Ministry of Education at
Belgrade.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 89

The depository of governmental publications sent to the Nether-
lands, at the request of that Government, has been changed from the
Library of the Second Chamber of the States General to the Royal
Library at The Hague.

The Government of the Commonwealth of Australia, which was tem-
porarily located in Melbourne, has moved into the recently founded
city of Canberra. The set of United States governmental documents
sent to the Library of the Commonwealth Parliament, therefore, is
now being forwarded to that city instead of to Melbourne.

INTERPARLIAMENTARY EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL JOURNAL

During the year, three additional foreign depositories were added
to the list of those ‘receiving the daily issue of the Congressional
Record, the depositories being located in Brazil, Irish Free State, and
Turkey.

The two chambers of the National Congress of Spain having been
superceded by a national assembly with but one chamber, only one
copy of the Record is now forwarded to the Spanish Legislature
instead of two. The total number of establishments receiving copies
of the daily issue of the Congressional Record is 101.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE AGENCIES

The Italian Office of International Exchanges, which since its
organization had been under the direction of the Victor Emanuel
National Library in Rome, was during the latter part of the year
placed under the ministry of public instruction.

The Dutch Central Scientific Bureau, which for many years con-
ducted the exchange agency for the Netherlands and was under the
direction of various scientific organizations, was made, on January
1, 1928, a subdivision of the Federal organization and placed under
the direction of the Royal Library at The Hague. Information has
been received from the latter to the effect that the name and address
of the agency is now International Exchange Bureau of the Nether-
lands, Royal Library, Kazernestraat, The Hague. A list of the

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1928. The appropriation made by Congress for the regular
maintenance of the park was $175,000, and there was the usual allot-
ment of $300 for printing and binding. Of the appropriation,
$126,000 was expended for salaries and labor in connection with the
maintenance of the park; $22,800 for food for animals; and $4,701
for coal.

There has been no important increase in the collection of animals,
though a number of species new to the collection have been added.

ACCESSIONS

Gijts——There were added to the collection by gift or deposit 188
specimens from 87 different donors. Notable among the gifts are a
shoe-bill stork and two red birds of paradise which were purchased
from the Chrysler fund. Mrs. James Cox Brady, of New York City,
presented a flock of six of the beautiful Forsten’s parrakeets. Col.
H. A. Shumaker, of McElhattan, Pa., presented three plains wolves,
a pair of which have since bred in the park.

From the United States Biological Survey, through its chief, Mr.
' Paul G. Redington, the park obtained a beautiful specimen of the
young Kadiak bear. The acquisition of young animals is of great
importance, for although the national collection is one of the most
notable, many of the animals are now very old. The Yakatat bear,
for instance, has been here 28 years, and young specimens, especially
of the Alaskan species, are highly desirable.

Through Dr. H. C. Kellers, United States Navy, now on duty with
the Marine Corps in Nicaragua, the park has received two original
collections of Central American birds and animals, among them
toucans, a cage of spider monkeys, and a cage of coatimundis, all of
which make attractive exhibits.

Mrs. Ethel E. Allicoate, Washington, D. C., screech owl.
American Nature Association, Washington, D. C., two European flamingoes.
Mrs. Anne Archbold, Washington, D. C., one kinkajou.

The office of the Chief Coordinator has again transferred certain

Births —Among the births of the park this year have been yak,
tahr, American elk, Alpine ibex, mouflon, barasingha deer, hog deer,
fallow deer, red deer, Sika deer, bison, mountain sheep, llama, gray
wolves, aoudads, wart hogs, agouti, rhesus monkey, and leopards.
Both pairs of leopards secured by the Smithsonian-Chrysler expedi-
tion mated in the zoo and each produced a litter of two cubs, which
are doing well. An American white pelican was raised in the pelican
pond near the Harvard Street entrance, which is the first breeding
record of this bird in captivity, and two more blue geese have been
hatched. The herd of Rocky Mountain sheep was augmented by
100 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

2 lambs, and at the close of the year there were 10 individuals—8 born
in the park and 4 of them grandchildren.

Eachanges-—The most important of the animals received in ex-
change were a mate to the Mongolian wild horse which we already
had, a pair of South African big-eared foxes, and a collection of
eight species of lories.

Purchases—The principal purchases of the year were a young
South African buffalo; an inyala, the first of its kind to reach
America; a pair of brown hyena, also unique of their kind in America;
three wolverines secured by Dr. W. H. Chase, of Cordova, Alaska; a
rhinoceros horn-bill; and a hyacinthine macaw.

La Société Nationale d’Acclimatation de France during the year
awarded the park its medal in recognition of the raising of the blue
goose.

Removals.—Losses by death include the two giraffes, Hi-boy and
Dot, both of which died of nephritis with complications. Other
serious losses are a Kadiak bear, which had lived in the park from
December 15, 1903, to August 28, 1927; white-tailed gnu, arrived
June 23, 1914, died November 21, 1927; a sambar deer, received May
22, 1912, died January 2, 1928; our last cheetah, which had arrived
August 8, 1913, died September 6, 1927; an American bison, born
in the zoo May 24, 1907, died September 4, 1927; jaguar, arrived
May 1, 1915, died June 28, 1928; European black stork, arrived May
18, 1902, died May 13, 1928; West African crowned crane, arrived
May 25, 1905, died February 21, 1928; gila monster, received Sep-
tember 21, 1910, died January 11, 1928; anaconda, received August
17, 1899, died August 26, 1927.

The long life of the cheetah is a record for an individual of its
apecies living in the North, and the anaconda, having lived for 28
years in the park, provides a most notable record for longevity of
this snake, which is usually not hardy in captivity.

The loss in the reptile collection has been great, as we have no
suitable quarters for them.

logical division of the Bureau of Animal Industry. The following
list shows the results of autopsies:

VISITORS
The estimated attendance as recorded in the daily reports of the

park was somewhat smaller than last year, when the interest of the
public in the Smithsonian-Chrysler expedition brought great crowds
of visitors; however, it is higher than any other year in the history
of the zoo, and from observation the number of out-of-town visitors
was unusually great. One morning there were 1,100 visitors from the
State of Pennsylvania and another morning 750 from the same State.
Automobile license tags show that visitors come from every State in
the Union.

During the year the park has been the center of a number of
scientific activities. The American Society of Mammalogists, the
American Ornithologists’ Union, and the Society of Ichthyologists
and Herpetologists all visited the park officially and had their annual
smoker at the administration building. The Vivarium Society has
held monthly meetings at the park.

The attendance of organized classes of students was 27,959, from
445 different schools.

IMPROVEMENTS

The bird house was completed in June and the installation of the
birds commenced, so the building will be opened to the public early
in the summer. This building is unique of its kind in providing four
rooms under one roof, with 145 indoor cages. The great flight cage
in the center room is 58 feet long by 22 feet wide and 30 feet high,
with rock work and running water at one end, a large pool in the
middle, and a fine tree at the oppesite end, and makes, with its con-
tents, a remarkably fine exhibit. Mr. Harris, the District architect,
and Arthur L. Smith, the contractor, deserve great credit for this
building, which has been highly praised by visitors from other
zoological parks and by the public in general.

Outdoor cages will be built during the coming fall, which will
make the bird house the center of the ornithological section of the
park. It is planned to develop the area about this building as runs
for outdoor birds.

In connection with the bird house, the maintenance force of the
park has done a great deal of work, cutting down a considerable hill
to permit a good approach to the building, building walks and roads,
installing sewers, and other details necessary to the new building, so
that in general we have been able to make few improvements in other
parts of the park.

NEEDS OF THE ZOO

At present a considerable part of the appropriation has to be spent each year
in repairing temporary structures. (Report of June 30, 1902.)

The inadequacy of the appropriations for the proper equipment of the park
has made it necessary to exercise an unwise economy in the construction of its
110 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

buildings and other shelters, the majority of which are of a cheap and tem-
porary character, and sooner or later must be replaced. (Report of June 30,
1906.)

It should be remembered that at the inception of the park the funds pro-
vided for buildings and improvements were entirely inadequate for its proper
equipment and that consequently the management was forced to construct cheap,
temporary shelters, roads, walks, and inclosures. These have now arrived at
about their limit of usefulness and do not admit of further economical repair.
(Report of June 30, 1909.)

The buildings mentioned in the above reports are still being used.

For more than 20 years earnest, but at the same time modest,
appeals have been made in each annual report for adequate housing
of the animals. Our buildings have been for years a source of most
unfavorable comment on the part of visitors. While other zoos
throughout the United States have been improving and enlarging,
the National Zoological Park, with the exception of the bird house,
has been able to do almost nothing in the way of construction, so
that at present, in comparison with a half dozen other American
zoos, our equipment is extremely shabby. It is impossible to main-
tain the collection at its present status if this condition is ignored.
The fine new bird house just completed is an indication of the condi-
tions that should be provided for other animals.

To house a collection of animals properly, suitable buildings are
needed, and the following building program is presented. This pro-
gram is limited to strictly essential buildings:

1. Exhibition house for reptiles, amphibians, and invertebrates, with
proper heating and lighting apparatus (based on cost of recent rep-
tile housesielsewhenre) - ee ee ee $220, 000

2. Ape, lemur, and small mammal house—this to house the collection of

APPENDIX 7

REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Sm: The Astrophysical Observatory was conducted under the fol-
lowing passage of the independent offices appropriation act approved
February 11, 1927:

Astrophysical Observatory: For maintenance of the Astrophysical Observa-
tory, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including assistants,
purchase of books, periodicals, and apparatus, making necessary observations
in high altitudes, repairs and alterations of buildings, preparation of manu-
scripts, drawings, and illustrations, traveling expenses, and miscellaneous
expenses, $32,060, of which amount not to exceed $29,000 may be expended for
personal services in the District of Columbia.

The observatory occupies a number of frame structures within an
inclosure of about 16,000 square feet south of the Smithsonian Admin-
istration Building at Washington, a cement observing station and
frame structure for observers on a plot of 10,000 square feet leased
from the Mount Wilson Observatory, and an observing station on
Table Mountain, Calif. This last station, provided by Mr. John A,
Roebling, includes a tunnel for instruments, small structures for the
field director and for the assistant, a shop, and a garage.

The Astrophysical Observatory also defrays a part of the cost of
the maintenance of the observing station at Montezuma, Chile, which
was erected in 1920 with means furnished by Mr. Roebling. The
constructions there comprise a tunnel for instruments, a small struc-
ture for observers, shop, garage, and a telephone line 12 miles to
Calama.

The present value of the buildings and equipment for the Astro-
physical Observatory owned by the Government is estimated at
$50,000. This estimate contemplates the cost required to replace the
outfit for the purposes of the investigations.

WORK AT WASHINGTON

(a) Reduction of observations.—Three field stations—Table Moun-
tain, Calif., Montezuma, Chile, and Brukkaros, South West Africa—
are now steadily sending results of daily observations of the intensity
of solar radiation to the Smithsonian Institution. The work of com-
paring these observations, of detecting and determining sources of
error, and correcting therefor, and the care of keeping the three
stations, thousands of miles away in the wilderness, supplied with

111
112 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

material and personnel has occupied much time of the director and
staff in Washington.

Several years having gone by since the station at Table Mountain
began its regular work, enough data had accumulated to justify a ©
statistical study over the whole period, to detect any systematic
errors. Minute systematic errors in the uncorrected results are in-
evitable. We are attempting to determine the intensity of the sun’s
energy not only as it is received at the observatory but also as it was
in free space outside the atmosphere. Humidity and dust produce
effects which it is impossible to ascertain precisely on any given indi-
vidual day by any method. Hence only by comparing the average
run of the results over a term of years with the average run of atmos-
pheric conditions during the same interval can these not quite negli-
gible residual systematic errors be determined and allowed for.
Such a study of the Table Mountain work has been in progress.
When completed there were revealed certain discordances between
Table Mountain and Montezuma which, though small, demanded still
further study.

As so often has happened in the history of science, this study by
my colleague, Mr. Fowle, of a perplexing discordance has brought a
new discovery of some importance. It is that the ozone existing in
the atmosphere at a level of 30 to 50 kilometers (18 to 30 miles), and
which is formed from the atmospheric oxygen by the action of
invisible ultra-violet sun rays, is variable in amount over Table
Mountain, though nearly constant in amount over Montezuma. The
discrepancy in the final results of radiation work between the two
stations appears to be due mainly to this variability of atmospheric
ozone at Table Mountain. Regular observations of ozone are now
in progress there in cooperation with Doctor Dobson, of Oxford,
England.

The tedious but necessary computations and statistical comparisons
involved in the work of systematizing and correcting the preliminary
results of the observations, only part of which is indicated in the
discussion above, have employed Mr. Fowle and two computers con-
tinually during the year.

(6) Apparatus—Under the direction of the writer and his col-
league, Mr. Aldrich, the instrument maker, Mr. Kramer, has con-
tinued to make apparatus for radiation investigations. One instru-
ment upon which much attention has been lavished is a new form of
pyrheliometer to measure more accurately and conveniently the sun’s
radiation. So accurate and stable is the silver-disk pyrheliometer
which we have employed for nearly 20 years, and of which over 50
copies have been furnished by the Smithsonian at cost to other insti-
tutions at home and abroad, that it is hard to prepare a new instru-
ment superior to it. Yet there are two or three slight sources of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 113

error, and a certain slowness of reading characteristic of the silver-
disk instrument which it is hoped to improve upon. Thus far the
new instrument, of a compensating electrical type, has not quite
reached expectations, but it is still hoped to overcome its deficiencies
and retain its advantages.

Attention was also paid to the improvement of the radiometer for
measuring the energy of the spectra of the stars. In this instrument
it was proposed to seal the sensitive element in a truly circular,
optically figured quartz tube containing a small pressure of hydrogen,
and to adjust the position and direction of the system by moving and
rotating the inclosing cylinder. The device was made ready for use
by the writer during the summer of 1928 at Mount Wilson, Calif.,
with good results, which will properly be described in next year’s
report.

In connection with a research by Mr. Aldrich on the radiation and
convection of the normally clothed human body, a number of instru-
mental appliances were also made.

(c) Research on the loss of heat from the human body.—Inquiry
was made of the writer by Mr. T. J. Duffield, secretary to the New
York Commission on Ventilation, as to the proportion of the loss of
heat of the normally clothed human body which should be ascribed
to radiation rather than to convection by the air. ‘The subject needed
investigation, and at the writer’s suggestion a grant of $1,000 was
made by the New York Commission on Ventilation to the Smithsonian
to promote it. My colleague, Mr. Aldrich, undertook the work and
made several long series of novel and valuable experiments, the results
of which will shortly be published. He employed principally two
instruments: First, the melikeron, or honeycomb pyranometer, for
observing radiation of bodies at low temperature, first described in
these reports for the years 1919 and 1920; and second, a special
thermoelectric temperature tester constructed for the research.

Mr. Aldrich sums up his results as follows:

(1) The radiation from the skin and clothing is approximately
that of a “black body ” or perfect radiator.

(2) Skin temperatures computed from melikeron radiation measure-
ments are about 1° C. higher than skin temperatures measured di-
rectly with the thermoelement. This is not true on clothing of
calorimeters. Apparently the melikeron sees deeper into the pores
of the skin than the level observed by the thermoelement.

(3) A cloth-covered, vertical, cylindrical calorimeter at body tem-
perature loses in still air 60 per cent by radiation, 40 per cent by
convection. <A similar horizontal calorimeter loses 54 per cent by
radiation, 46 per cent by convection. The human body convection
loss is probably similar to this; that is, the convection loss is roughly
114 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

one-third less than the radiation loss in still air and normal room:
temperatures.

(4) Increasing air motion rapidly decreases the percentage radia-
tion loss and increases the convectional. With the vertical calo-

rimeter:

greater than the corresponding skin temperature drop. Summary of

lows:

(9) Tests with the thermoelement show that the air temperature
falls to room temperature very rapidly as the distance from the body
increases. That is, there is a steep temperature gradient in the first
centimeter or so from the body surface. With the thermoelement 30
em. away no effect of the presence of the body could be detected.

(10) The Abbot-Benedict work (Table A) indicates that the radi.
ation loss from a nude subject is about twice as great for a room tem-
perature of 15° as it is for 2 room temperature of 26°. This evidence
does not entirely support the “ suit-of-clothes ” theory referred to by
DuBois. In explanation of this theory, he says (p. 885, 1927 ed. Basal
Metabolism) : “A constriction of the peripheral blood vessels (oc-
curs) and the amount of heat carried to the surface is relatively small
in proportion to the heat produced. * * * The patient really
changes his integument into a suit of clothes and withdraws the zone
where the blood is cooled from the skin to a level some distance below
the surface.”

(11) Normal fluctuations in humidity indoors produce negligible
effect upon the radiation loss. This is to be expected. Our bodies,
about 300° absolute, radiate almost wholly between the wave lengths
4u and 50% with a maximum at 10u. Water vapor absorption is so
strong for much of this range and so nearly negligible near the
maximum, that its possible effect is so fully produced, even by the
humidity of an ordinary room, that the effect of changes of the quan-
tity of water vapor in the ordinary room is small. Were the air of the
room exceedingly dry, changes might be noticeable.

WORK IN THE FIELD

(a) Solar radiation work at three desert mountain stations —As
far as possible, daily measurements of the intensity of solar radia-
tion have been made at the Smithsonian stations at Table Mountain,
Calif., and Mount Montezuma, Chile. Also similar measurements
have gone on regularly at the cooperating station of the National
Geographic Society on Mount Brukkaros, South West Africa.

Pending completion of the statistical investigations of the results
of the two last-named stations, as mentioned above, only the results
obtained at Mount Montezuma are being published at present. By
continued cooperation of the United States Weather Bureau, the daily
116 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

telegraphed values of the solar constant of radiation are being regu-
larly published on the Washington daily weather map.

As tentatively and privately forecasted in November, 1927, on the
basis of hitherto observed periodicities in solar phenomena, the
“solar constant ” values reached a high level in the spring months
of 1928, and were expected to reach a low level in the autumn.
Much interest attaches to these tentative forecasts of the solar energy
to be expected for Jong periods in advance, but several years must
yet elapse before (if ever) they can be made with sufficient confidence
to justify publication.

Although the solar radiation measurements have been reduced to
a routine for several years at all our stations, the very high degree
of accuracy now demanded and generally achieved is occasionally
marred by new and unexpected accidents and difficulties. Thus
internal evidence disclosed that some obscure error of very consid-
erable amount began in August, 1927, to affect the sky radiation
measurements of the pyranometer on Table Mountain. Our best
thought and many experiments had failed to disclose the obscure
cause up to the close of the period of this report, but by anticipation
I may say that at this time of writing (October 3) the error has been
detected, cured, and a beginning has been made to eliminate its
influence from the final results of the observations. This circum-
stance has prevented us from making public Table Mountain results
hitherto.

(b) Measurements of atmospheric ozone-—Doctor Dobson, of Ox-
ford, England, having perfected a spectroscopic method for deter-
mining the quantity of atmospheric ozone, has found that quantity
variable in most interesting relations to solar phenomena and to
weather. He has established a chain of cooperating observatories in
Europe, and, by aid of a grant from Mr. John A. Roebling, the
Smithsonian was able to equip the Montezuma station with the
necessary apparatus. For about one year daily measurements were
made at Montezuma by Field Director Freeman, aided by Mrs. Free-
man. The photographs taken were reduced in England by Doctor
Dobson and his colleagues, but, contrary to European experience,
showed almost zero variation. They also showed a much smaller
quantity of atmospheric ozone at Montezuma than in Europe.

Finding further observations at Montezuma unnecessary because
of the uniformly constant results, the apparatus was returned to
Oxford, restandardized, and sent to Table Mountain, Calif., where it
is now installed for daily observing.

(c) Expeditions to Mount Wilson.—As stated in last year’s report,
the writer undertook at Mount Wilson, in the autumn of 1927, to

1At this writing (October 3), this latter forecast also has been supported by September
results.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 117

continue radiometer measurements of the distribution of energy in
the spectra of the stars. This work was made possible by the availa-
bility of the 100-inch telescope of the Mount Wilson Observatory.
It had been proposed to substitute hydrogen for air in the radiometer,
on the theory that the radiometer reaction would be nearly the same,
but the damping and consequent sluggishness of action would be
much diminished in so hght and free-moving a gas as hydrogen.

Arriving in July, 1927, at Pasadena, the writer constructed the
radiometer vanes from bits of house-flies’ wings. Incidentally it was
observed that it requires about 6,000,000 house-flies’ wings to weigh
one pound. With a fragment of microscope cover glass (ground and
polished to about one-third the usual thickness) the mirror of the
radiometer system was prepared. Two such systems of unequal, but
both of almost microscopic size, were hung upon quartz fibers so fine
as usually to be invisible, and were tested in air and in hydrogen at
various pressures. With them was used also a bolometric element
designed to give basis for an estimate of the comparative rise of tem-
perature of the radiometer vanes, when exposed to a constant source
of radiation, but contained in the different test gases.

Hydrogen proved somewhat less efficient in regard to rise of tem-
perature and radiometer reaction than air, but abundantly justified
the expectation that its damping properties were much less objec-
tionable. On the whole, hydrogen appeared greatly superior as the
radiometer gas, and a carefully built system, with vanes 0.35 milli-
meters wide and 1 millimeter tall, was constructed. It had three
vanes in parallel on either side of the stem, separated 1 millimeter
between centers. This system was sealed into a glass? case in hydro-
gen under 0.23 millimeter pressure of mercury. Provision had been
made to rotate the system by a magnetic device.

After many trials, the device proved useless, because the mecha-
nism required to rotate the system so as to bring it to face in the
proper direction so stirred up the gas that wholly unexpected motions
resulted. After much labor the experiment was given up for the
year 1927.

For use in 1928, at Doctor Adams’s suggestion, there was prepared
an optically figured quartz cylindrical vessel. This fused quartz cyl-
inder, of beautiful clearness, was made to my order by the General
Electric Co., and was figured within and without at the Mount Wilson
Observatory shop. Being truly a circular cylinder with optically
figured concentric walls, it mattered not at all in what direction the
radiometer looked out. Thus by mounting the whole cylinder from a

‘LT am greatly indebted to the director and staff of the Bureau of Standards, especially

Mr. Sperling, and to the director and staff of the Mount Wilson Observatory, especially

Mr. Pompeo, for the construction of the special glass apparatus and the preparation for
its use on Mount Wilson.

brass support, rotatable in a ground joint, the radiometer could be
inclosed in an airtight outside case of brass having windows, toward
which the radiometer could at any time be made to look out by merely
rotating the brass piece in its well-ground seat.

With this simple but adequate apparatus the Mount Wilson expe-
dition was renewed by the writer in 1928, with a high degree of suc-
cess, which must be related in next year’s report.

Personnel.—During the year the personnel has been as follows:

At Washington :
Director, Dr. C. G. ABBOT.
Research Pete F. E. Fow te, Jr., L. B. ALDRICH.
Temporary assistant, M, KK. BAUGHMAN.
Computers, Mrs. A. M. Bonn, Miss M. A. MARSDEN.
Instrument maker, A. KRAMER.
At Table Mountain:
Field director, A. F. Moore.
Field assistants, H. H. Zoprnrer, H. B. FREEMAN.’
At Mount Montezuma :
Field directors, H. B. FREEMAN, H. H. ZopTNer.
Field assistants, E. E. WARNER, M. K. BAUGHMAN.
At Mount Brukkaros:
Field director, W. H. Hoover.
Field assistant, F. A. GREELEY. ;

Summary.—A. novel research on the relative cooling of the human
body by radiation and by air convection has yielded unexpected and
valuable results. Improvements in instruments include a new form
of sensitive radiometer in which by the substitution of hydrogen for
air a great increase in quickness of response permits the use of exces-
sively light systems and promises a great development of sensitive-
ness. Continued progress in the reduction and systematization of
the results of solar radiation work have brought the study of the
ozone content of the atmosphere as a new element in the determina-
tion of the solar constant of radiation. Daily observations have been
continued at Table Mountain, Calif., Mount Montezuma, Chile, and
(in cooperation with the National Geographic Society) at Mount
Brukkaros, South West Africa. By cooperation with the United
States Weather Bureau, daily publication of the values of the solar
constant of radiation for the use of meteorologists has been effected.

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE

Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith the following report on
the operations of the United States Regional Bureau of the Inter-
national Catalogue of Scientific Literature for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1928:

Since actual publication of the International Catalogue was sus-
pended in 1922, owing to the inability of the foreign bureaus to
contribute their quota of the necessary financial support, it has been
the policy of this bureau to keep its expenditures at the lowest pos-
sible amount consistent with the need of keeping the organization
operating sufficiently to compile the necessary records of current
scientific publications. This policy has been explained each year to
the Bureau of the Budget and to congressional appropriation com-
mittees, the understanding being that until publication was resumed
some part of the appropriation would revert to the surplus fund of
the Treasury. Each year a surplus has reverted, and this year it
was found possible to allow the classifier to take seven months’ fur-
lough without seriously interfering with the necessary routine. By
this means an additional saving of $1,225 was made, the gross ex-
penditures of the year being $5,867.29 out of the appropriation of
$7,260, the remainder, $1,392.71, reverting to the Treasury.

As the financial status of a number of the cooperating foreign

countries now appears to be established on a firmer basis than at any

time since the war, this bureau is making an effort, through corre-
spondence, to formulate a practical plan whereby the necessary sup-
port may be had to enable the Central Bureau to resume publication.
To this end letters were sent to the several members of the executive
committee of the catalogue and to the director of the London Central
Bureau in whose hands control of the organization is vested. As
these letters outline the situation and are self-explanatory, I submit
copies herewith.
May 22, 1928.

DeEaR Sir: As a member of the executive committee of the International

Catalogue of Scientific Literature, to which the International Convention in

Brussels in July, 1922, referred the question of the future of the undertaking, I
beg to submit the following:

119
120 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

Among the resolutions adopted, 4 and 5 read as follows:

(4) That the convention is of opinion that the international organization
should be kept in being through mutual agreement to continue as far as pos-
sible the work of the regional bureaus until Such time as it may be economically
possible to resume publication.

(5) That it be referred to the executive committee to consider and, after
full consultation wi:h interested bodies, to make proposals as to the form of
future publication and to report with some definite scheme to a meeting of the
international council, to be summoned as soon as it appears possible that publi-
cation can be resumed,

From the implied agreement in resolution 4, I assume that the organization
may still look to the regioial bureaus to take up again their former work
when called on by the central bureau to do so, and from resolution 5 it is clearly
the duty of the executive committee to formulate a definite scheme as soon as
it appears possible that publication can be resumed.

As a preliminary step to the preparation of such a scheme an exchange of
views by correspondence among the several members of the executive committee
seems desirable, in order that all local and personal ideas may be assembled
and coordinated before summoning a meeting of the international council.

Among the questions which might be satisfactorily settled through corre-
spondence are the following:

To what extent could the central bureau depend on each regional bureau
(1) to supply classified data and (2) to secure subscriptions for the support of
the Catalogue.

Could an edition of 1,000 sets be disposed of at $50 per set?

Could a catalogue aggregating 10,000 pages be produced for $50,000 per year?

I am of the opinion that this sum would be sufficient, and submit with this
copies of two letters sent to Doctor Morley and Professor Armstrong on January
12, 1928, cutlining the present condition as I see it and giving an estimate of
the probable cost of publication.

I would appreciate detailed suggestions which would further in any way our
common aim and, as I think, duty to prepare and report a definite scheme
whereby this unique and valuable international work may be enabled to resume
publication.

I am most anxious also to have such a definite and well-considered plan
available to submit to possible donors, should any appear, before a meeting of
the international council is held.

Trusting that this move may meet with your approval and gain your
cooperation, I am

Sincerely yours,
LEONARD C, GUNNELL.

JANUARY 12, 1928.
Dr. H. Forster MoRr.Ley,
Director, International Catalogue of Scientifie Literature,
London, England,

Dear Docror MortEY: I am sending with this a copy of a letter sent to-day to
Professor Armstrong and trust that you and he will be able to outline some plan
of action whereby the Catalogue may again be published. With 10,000 pages to |
be printed each year, or about 33 pages per day of printed matter that could be
made simple and uniform in character, I believe that the organization could
profitably run a plant of its own and issue classified cards, or advance sheets, of
the material to be later assembled and published in annual catalogues.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 121

* * * JT have just consulted a practical printer and he states that our re-
quirements could be met with two typeseiting machines and one high-grade press,
costing approximately a total of $10,000. * * * I believe the whole yearly
eost of printing could be met for $17,500. These are American estimates and
the cost should be materially less in England, but even this figure is half the esti-
mated cost at $3.50 per page. Although the figures are necessarily only approx-
imate they are encouraging enough to warrant looking into the matter in de
tail. With your central bureau and printing plant wnder one roof the organiza-
tion would certainly be in a position to overcome the most serious faults charged
against the Catalogue, high price, and delayed publication.

I did not want to complicate my letter to Professor Armstrong, but the cost of
production is the only really serious question to confront us for there is no
question in my mind as to the need of the Catalogue, and as we produced it once
Wwe can produce it again. Every dollar cut from the subscription price will,
without doubt, increase the number of subscribers, therefore I am most anxious
to get your opinion of this phase of the problem. Editing, assembling, and print-
ing in our case is a question of uniform and continuous production and can cer-
tainly be greatly simplified and cheapened if we consider it in that light.

With kindest regards, I am

Sincerely yours,
LEONARD C. GUNNELL.,

JANUARY 12, 1928.
Prof. HENRY E. ARMSTRONG,

Chairman, Executive Committee International Catalogue of
Scientific Literature, Royal Society of London, London, England.

DEAR PROFESSOR ARMSTRONG: I feel that if the International Catalogue is ever
to resume publication some definite steps should be taken looking to that end.
Assuming that the agreement made by the delegates at the Brussels convention
of 1922 to keep the organization in being is still in force, the question of resump-
tion is in the hands of the executive committee named at that time and author-
ized to report with some definite scheme. As I am one of that committee, of
which you are the chairman, I feel that any steps I might take, after consulting
you, in an attempt to forward the interests of the Catalogue would be within
my province and can be taken quite independently of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, which need not appear in the matter until some assurance of success is
evident.

The situation as I see it is: That the International Catalogue of Scientific
Literature, to supply an authors’ and classified subject catalogue of the cur-
rent literature of pure science, is as much a necessity now as it was in 1900,
since no similar service or publication has taken its place.

That the organization still exists duly authorized to prepare and publish such
a catalogue.

That the enterprise can be made self-supporting if financial support sufficient
to cover one year’s editorial and printing expenses can be procured.

That if an edition of 1,000 sets can be sold at $50 a set the publication costs
can be covered.

I am led to this opinion by the fact that a prominent American publisher has
offered, if furnished regularly with manuscript to fill 10,000 pages of printed
matter, to print, publish, and bind, in paper, an edition of 1,000 for $8.50 a page,
or $35,000. Adding $15,000 as the approximate cost of a central bureau staff,
the total would be $50,000 needed for an edition of 1,000. I believe that regular
subscribers to take this edition of 1,000 sets could be readily enrolled at a price
of $50 per set and the organization would thus become self-supporting. I assume
122 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

that if American publishers could print the Catalogue for $3.50 per page, in an
edition of 1,000, some English printer would do the work for that sum or less.

Before any financial aid could be reasonably applied for the “ definite scheme,”
which the executive committee was authorized to prepare, would have to be
submitted, and I think that it is time for the committee to take some action.

A definite scheme could be prepared after taking the matter up with the
regional bureaus and determining the probable support each could be depended
on to provide in material for the Catalogue and subscribers. It would then be
necessary to prepare revised schedules of classification and lists of journals
to be indexed. From previous experience I am sure that you will agree with
me that the schedules should be far more simple than those previously used
and that the journals and papers indexed should be limited strictly to pure
science, else the whole undertaking would be too ponderous at the very begin-
ning. I feel that after a start has been made an allied though supplementary
index of the applied sciences would be feasible and certainly most desirable,
but this could not be attempted until the more simple index to pure science is
provided and put on a paying basis. What in your opinion would be the
attitude of the Royal Society and the Zoological Record?

The plan published in the acta of the convention of 1922 included disposal of
the stock of complete sets at a reduced price, when publication should be
resumed, as a means of repaying the debt to the Royal Society, and this plan
would still hold.

With kindest regards, I am

Sincerely yours, Lronarp C. GUNNELL.

While it is as yet too soon to forecast what the result of this move
toward reorganization will be, it seems probable that the various
countries previously represented will again cooperate by furnishing
the necessary bibliographical data to the central bureau, but it is
doubtful if they are in a position to subscribe to the capital fund
necessary to start the operations of the central bureau.

The French bureau’s reply, dated June 22, 1928, seems to bear out
this idea, the reply stating: “If therefore the Catalogue were resumed
we could immediately furnish everything relating to France.” ‘The
French bureau, however, could promise nothing toward the support
of the central bureau, but has requested the director of public instruc-
tion to canvass the French universities for subscribers.

If during the coming year a definite scheme can be agreed upon by
the countries formerly cooperating in the work, it appears likely that
the comparatively small sum needed to begin publication could be
raised in the United States. It would appear both fitting and
proper to have aid extended from this country to reestablish a great
and useful enterprise originally founded on the idea and suggestion
of an American pioneer in science, Joseph Henry, first secretary of
the Smithsonian Institution.

Respectfully submitted.

Lronarp C. GUNNELL,

Assistant in Charge.

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.

APPENDIX 9

REPORT ON THE LIBRARY
| Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activi-
ties of the library of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year

ended June 30, 1928:

THE LIBRARY

|

|

| The Smithsonian library, or, more properly speaking, the Smith-
-sonian library system, comprises the Smithsonian deposit in
| the Library of Congress, which is the main library of the Institu-
tion, the library of the United States National Museum, the Smith-
_sonian office library, the Langley aeronautical library, the technologi-
cal library, and the libraries of the Astrophysical Observatory, the
National Gallery of Art, the Freer Gallery of Art, and the National
) Zoological Park, together with the 36 sectional libraries of the Na-
tional Museum. To these may later be added a tenth divisional
library, namely, that of the Bureau of American Ethnology. With
its 700,000 volumes, pamphlets, and charts, chiefly scientific in char-
acter, including especially society and serial publications, the Smith-
sonian library not only is an invaluable instrument in the work of
the Institution and indirectly of other research institutions through-
out the country, but represents an important link in the chain of
libraries in the service of the Federal Government.

THE STAFF

It is gratifying to report that during the last fiscal year a way
was found of providing for a second position of assistant librarian—
the first, that of chief of the reference department, having been
established two years before. This new position will be set up
immediately and will be filled by the appointment of a chief for
the accessions department—the department which acquires publica-
tions for the library, partly by purchase and gift but mainly by
exchange; which carries on an extensive correspondence, particu-
larly with the learned societies and institutions of the world, keeps
a file of this correspondence and a record of the items acquired,
with their sources, and assigns them to the divisions and sections
of the library in which they promise to be of most use.

123

124 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

Several changes occurred in the personnel during the year. Mrs.
Natalie M. Bennett, junior librarian, resigned and her place was filled
by the appointment of Miss Gertrude L. Woodin, a graduate of
Wellesley College and of the Albany Library School, who has had
many years of experience in library work. Miss Woodin is direct-
ing the preparation of the union catalogue. Mr. R. Webb Noyes,
junior librarian, also resigned and was succeeded by Miss Elisa-
beth Hobbs, a graduate of George Washington University and
of Simmons College Library School. At various times during the
year the following persons were members of the staff on tempo-
rary appointment: Miss Helen V. Barnes, Mrs. Adeila E. Blanchard,
Mr. Arthur W. Gerth, Miss Elisabeth Hobbs: Miss Josephine H.
Kinney, Miss Mary dal Mrs. M. Landon Reed, Mrs. Hope H.
Simmons, and Mr. Giles E. Taggart.

EXCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS

Since its founding in 1846 the Smithsonian Institution and its
branches as one by one they have come into being have sent their
publications to other learned institutions and societies and to editors
of scientific journals throughout the world, and have received their
publications in return. Although from the beginning the increase
of the Smithsonian library has been due partly to purchases and
gifts, it has been due chiefly to this exchange. ‘These publications
have come to the library direct, or through the International Ex-
change Service, which is Hintaaene by the Institution. During
the fet fiscal year 26,316 packages, of one or more publications each,
came by mail, and 6,231 through the exchange. After these 32,547
packages had been opened the items were stamped, entered, and sent
to the appropriate units of the library, but chiefly to the Smithsonian
deposit in the Library of Congress and the lhbrary of the United
States National Museum. In connection with the acquiring of this
material the library wrote about 1,100 letters, sent out thousands of
acknowledgments, and took up exchange relations with many new
societies.

As usual dissertations were received from various universities and
technical schools both at home and abroad.

GIFTS

The gifts for the year were many. ‘Two were especially note-
worthy. One was the Chinese library of the late Hon. William

Woodville Rockhill, well-known traveler, scholar, and United States _

minister to China. This was presented to the Institution by Mrs.

Rockhill, and was deposited in the Freer Gallery of Art. It con- |
sisted of 1,100 volumes on the history, geography, literature, and

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 125

culture of Central Asia, particularly of Mongolia and Thibet, and
included a number of rare items, several in manuscript, and various
works of general reference, among which was a copy of the Palace
Edition of the Imperial Dictionary issued in 1716 in 40 volumes by a
commission of scholars under the personal supervision of Emperor
K’ang Hsi. This gift constitutes a most valuable supplement not
only to the Chinese works in the library of the Freer Gallery but to
those in the oriental division of the Library of Congress.

The other noteworthy gift came from the American Association for
the Advancement of Science. It comprised approximately 3,500
volumes of serial and society publications, from all parts of the world
and in nearly all Janguages, many in almost unbroken sets extending

over years. From this collection have already been selected more
— than 1,500 volumes and parts needed in the Smithsonian deposit and

the libraries of the National Museum and the Astrophysical Observa-
tory. Among these were some that were out of print and very rare,
including not a few that these libraries had been trying for some
time to get to complete their sets. The gift is one of the most useful
that the library has received in recent years.

Among other gifts worthy of especial mention were scientific publi-
cations in 68 volumes and 47 parts, lacking in the Smithsonian library,
from the Library of Congress; North American Wild Flowers,
volumes 1 to 38, by Mary Vaux Walcott, from the artist-author; a
collection of 70 volumes and 174 pamphlets, mainly on art, from

Dr. William H. Holmes, director of the National Gallery; various
_ works, in 50 volumes, chiefly on Egyptian art and archeology, from
Mrs. George Cabot Lodge; To Galdpagos on the Ara, 1926, by Wil-

lam K. Vanderbilt, from the author; A Souvenir of Wyoming—an
illustrated manuscript in 3 volumes, with text by John G. White,
being a diary of a fishing trip in Jackson Hole and Yellowstone Park,
with remarks on early history and historical geography—from

Thomas A. McCaslin; the Ronald Aeronautic Library, in 12 volumes,

presented by the publishers at the suggestion of Mr. Paul E. Garber,
assistant curator of the divisions of mineral and mechanical tech-
nology; and about 300 volumes, pertaining largely to the religions of
the Old World, from the estate of Dr. I. M. Casanowicz, late assistant

curator of the division of Old World archeology.

Many other gifts were also received, especially from Secretary

: Abbot, Assistant Secretary Wetmore, Mr. A. H. Clark, Dr. Walter

Hough, Dr. Ale’ Hrdli¢ka, Dr. W. R. Maxon, Mr. J. U. Perkins, Miss
M. J. Rathbun, Dr. C. W. Richmond, Mr. Robert Ridgeway, the late

| Dr. J. N. Rose, Mr. R. C. Smith, Dr. L. Stejneger, Mr. B. H. Swales,
-and Dr. J. R. Swanton.
126 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928
SMITHSONIAN DEPOSIT

The Smithsonian deposit, which, as has been said, is the main
library of the Institution, dates from 1866, when by an act of Con-
gress the Institution was authorized to deposit its library of 40,000
volumes in the Library of Congress. It is, of course, distributed
according to classification, but because of its prevailingly scientific
nature it is chiefly in the Smithsonian division, which was established
in 1900 to take care of the scientific publications in the deposit,
together with the works of like character belonging to the Library of
Congress.

The deposit has grown steadily by additions from the Institution,
and is now recognized as one of the outstanding collections of its
kind. It is especially rich in serial publications and in the reports,
proceedings, and transactions of the learned societies and institutions
of the world.

During the fiscal year just ended the Institution sent to the deposit
13,558 publications, of which 2,292 were volumes, 9,773 parts of vol-
umes, 988 pamphlets, and 505 charts. Documents of foreign govern-
ments, largely statistical in character, to the number of 7,376, were
also sent, without being stamped or entered, to the document division
of the Library of Congress. In addition to these, 13,187 disserta-
tions, most of which had been received in previous years from forty
or more universities and technical schools in different parts of the
world, but which the Institution, for lack of help, had not been able
to catalogue, were forwarded to the deposit, that they might be made
available to scholars at the earliest possible moment. Short title
cards for these dissertations will be sent to the Institution as soon as
they are prepared for filing in the union catalogue.

In response to special requests from the Library of Congress for
publications wanted for the deposit, the Smithsonian library was able
to obtain, as usual, many volumes and parts of volumes by exchange.
It is expected that this service will be greatly enlarged in the course
of a few months, as the result of the reorganization of the accessions
department of the library.

OFFICE LIBRARY

The office library consists of some of the more important society
publications that the Institution needs to have continually at hand,.
a set of its own publications and of those of its branches, the art-
room collection, the employees’ library, and various reference books,
some assigned for special use to other divisions of the library or to.)
the administrative offices of the Institution. To this library were—
added during the year 108 volumes and 34 pamphlets.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 127

The progress made on the union catalogue of the Smithsonian
library, which was kept until lately in the office reading room—the
room that now has become the catalogue room of the Institution—
was notable, especially in connection with the material in the Smith-
sonian deposit, the office library, the Langley aeronautical library,
and the libraries of the National Museum and the Astrophysical
Observatory. Cards were also added to the catalogue for the Rock-
hill collection of 1,100 volumes in Chinese recently given to the Insti-
tution and deposited in the library of the Freer Gallery of Art.
This progress is shown in detail by the following statistics:

MUSEUM LIBRARY

The library of the United States National Museum, which ranks
next in size and importance to the Smithsonian deposit in the library
system of the Institution, is composed principally of works on the
different branches of natural history represented in the Museum. Its
collections increased during the year by 3,015 volumes and 1,165

pamphlets, totaling more by several hundred than the increase even
_ of the year before when there was an unusually large gain in acces-
sions. The library now numbers 72,315 volumes and 106,881
_ pamphlets. Some of the additions came, of course, by purchase, but
' most came, as usual, by exchange and gift. The outstanding gift,
which, with other gifts to various divisions of the library of the Insti-
tution, is described earlier in this report, was received from the
American Association for the Advancement of Science.

In the course of the year 10,526 parts of periodicals were entered,
_ 821 volumes and 1,039 pamphlets were catalogued, and 2,382 cards
_ were added to the shelf list. The number of books and pamphlets

sent to the sectional libraries was 6,683. The loans to members of
the scientific staff numbered 5,013, of which 2,118 were borrowed
from the Library of Congress and 236 elsewhere. The other loans
totaled 89. These were made chiefly to Government libraries, but
| a score or more to libraries outside of Washington, including those
_ of the American Museum of Natural History, Archeological Institute
of America, Berkshire Atheneum, Carnegie Museum, EK. I. du Pont
' de Nemours & Co. Experimental Station, Rockefeller Institute, West-
_ field Normal School, Williams College, and the following universities :
_ Maryland, North Carolina, Princeton, and Toronto. The number of
128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

books sent back to other libraries was 2,451, of which 2,262 were
returned to the Library of Congress. The volumes prepared for
binding numbered nearly 2,200; of these 1,701 were sent to the bind-
ery during the fiscal year. As usual, thousands of publications were
consulted in the reading room, not merely by members of the Museum
staff, but by investigators from other departments of the Government
and elsewhere, including some from abroad. In connection with their
work an increased reference service was rendered by the library staff,
as was the case in connection with the many inquiries for information
that were received from different parts of the country.

The sectional libraries, which now number 36, were brought into
closer working relation with the main library of the Museum and
with the other units of the Smithsonian library system. The work
of completing their sets of society and serial publications was
continued, their binding was considerably advanced, and marked
progress was made in cataloguing their collections. The sectional
libraries are as follows:

Administration, Marine invertebrates.
Administrative assistant’s office. Mechanical technology.
American archeology. Medicine.

Anthropology. Minerals.

Biology. Mineral technology.
Birds. Mollusks,

Botany. Old World archeology.
Echinoderms. Organie chemistry.
Editor’s office. Paleobotany.

Hthnology. Photography.

Vishes. j Physical anthropology.
Foods. Property clerk’s office.
Geology. Reptiles and batrachians.
Graphic arts. Superintendent’s office.
History. Taxidermy.

Insects. Textiles.

Invertebrate paleontology. Vertebrate paleontology.
Mammals. Wood technology.

TECHNOLOGICAL LIBRARY

The reorganization of the technological library, which is housed
in the Arts and Industries Building, received particular attention.
Many thousands of Government publications not related directly to
the work of the institution and its branches, which had been accumu-
lating in the library for years, were returned to the Superintendent
of Documents, thus releasing space for the much needed rearranging
and expanding of the collections now going on. The most noticeable
change was made in the reference room. The cement floor was
covered with a cork carpet, many new shelves were built in, some
of the furniture was done over, and, to make the room still more

attractive, several ferns, palms, and other plants—the generous gift
of the Bureau of Plant Industry—were placed on the floor and in
the gallery. The collections in this room were entirely reorganized,
the less used books being removed to other parts of the library, and
those in constant demand by the curators put where they would be
immediately available. Among the latter were the standard refer-
ence works that belong to the library and a set of Smithsonian publi-
cations. To this room were also transferred from the Smithsonian
Building the current files of scientific and popular periodicals, and
the employees’ library. Finally, a trained assistant was put in
charge, and the room opened to the public, with the result that the
library increased its usefulness many fold, not only by making its
collections more accessible to the curators, but by providing material
and information, both directly and _ indirectly, for the readers and
other visitors who came to it daily.

The accessions for the year are included among those to the
Museum library.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY LIBRARY

The library of the Astrophysical Observatory, which occupies part
of the main hall of the Smithsonian Building and part of the ob-
servatory itself, comprises about 3,767 volumes and 2,725 pamphlets,
chiefly on astrophysics and meteorology. It is one of the most impor-
tant of the smaller units of the Smithsonian library system, and is
of especial value in connection with the well-known researches in
solar radiation that are being carried on by the Institution. During
the past year the catalogue for this hbrary, which was begun the
year before, was finished, and the collections were labeled and rear-
ranged. The accessions to the library were 130 volumes, 64 parts of
volumes, and 25 pamphlets. The number of volumes bound was 121.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY LIBRARY

The lbrary of the Bureau of American Ethnology, which is in
the Smithsonian Building, consists almost exclusively of works on
anthropology, particularly those pertaining to the American abo-
rigines, and covers especially the linguistics, history, archeology,
myths, religion, arts, sociology, and general culture of the American
Indian. It contains 27,921 volumes and 16,177 pamphlets. In its
special data files are manuscript material, photographs, Indian
vocabularies, etc. The activities of this library for the last fiscal
year are described in the report of the chief of the bureau, by whom
the library is administered.
130 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928
LANGLEY AERONAUTICAL LIBRARY

The Langley aeronautical library, as the aeronautical collection
of the Institution is now called, is rapidly coming to be a prominent
division of the Smithsonian library. While it is still comparatively
small, numbering only 1,612 volumes and 700 pamphlets, together
with a large number of photographs and newspaper clippings, it
includes many rare items, some of which were in the original gift
as it came from Samuel Pierpont Langley, the third secretary of the
Institution, after whom the library was named, and others among
the additions made since by Alexander Graham Bell, Octave
Chanute, and James Means. During the last year the recataloguing
of this library was begun, and well advanced. The accessions were
12 volumes. Much use was made of the collection, especially by
Government experts and others from different parts of the United
States and Europe, who were investigating matters of aeronautical
interest.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

The library of the National Gallery of Art, which occupies for
the present part of the Natural History Building, concerns itself
chiefly with the art of the United States and Europe. The collection,
while small, totalling only 848 volumes and 1,024 pamphlets, consti-
tutes a carefully chosen nucleus for the larger library that will be
formed when a special building is provided for the gallery. The
library was increased during the last year by 144 volumes, 714 parts
of volumes, and 288 pamphlets. The most important gift was
received from Dr. William H. Holmes, director of the gallery.
This is mentioned in more detail earlier in this report.

FREER GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

The library of the Freer Gallery of Art holds a unique place in
the Smithsonian library system. It contains many works in the
Chinese and Japanese languages, some of which are very rare, and
for purposes of research supplements to an important degree the
oriental division of the Library of Congress. It has to do mainly
with the interests represented by the collections of art objects
pertaining to the arts and cultures of the Far East, India, Persia,
and the nearer East; by the life and works of James McNeill Whistler
and of certain other American painters whose pictures are owned by
the gallery; and, further, to a very limited extent, by the Biblical
manuscripts of the fourth and fifth centuries, which, as the pos-
session of the Freer Gallery, are known as the Washington manu-
scripts. Additions to the library during the year numbered 1,126

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 131

volumes and 59 pamphlets. These included the William Wood-
ville Rockhill collection of 1,100 volumes in Chinese, which was
given to the Smithsonian Institution by Mrs. Rockhill and deposited
in the library of the gallery. This valuable gift is described else-
where in this report. The lbrary now has a total of 4,038 volumes
and 2,578 pamphlets. It also has a special collection of about 700
volumes and 500 pamphlets for the use of the field staff of the
gallery.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK LIBRARY

The library of the National Zoological Park, which is housed
in the administration building at the park, consists of about 1,200
volumes and 300 pamphlets on animals and other subjects of special
interest to the curators there. Its accessions during the last year
were 11 volumes and 2 pamphlets.

SUMMARY OF ACCESSIONS

The accessions for the year, with the exceptien of those to the
library of the Bureau of American Ethnology, may be summarized

The estimated number of volumes, pamphlets, and charts in the
Smithsonian library, not including those in the library of the Bu-
reau of American Ethnology, on June 30, 1928, was as follows:

This number does not include the many thousands of volumes in
the library still uncatalogued or awaiting completion.

SPECIAL ACTIVITIES

It was possible for the staff to undertake a number of special
tasks during the year, several of which may be mentioned.
132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

One of the larger accumulations of reprints was sorted according
to subject and distributed to the curators. This was an important
step in disposing of material valuable to the Institution but not
needed for cataloguing. As soon as help becomes available another
accumulation, much larger than the first, will be treated in like
manner.

A list was made, in preparation for cataloguing, of some of the
special collections, including the Casey, Dall, Gill, Henderson, Lacoe,
Roebling, Schaus, Springer, Teller, and Vaux, and of the volumes
in the John Donnell Smith botanical collection and the Watts de
Peyster library that had not already been catalogued. ‘To expedite
this work the Library of Congress was generous enough to contribute
for a few weeks the services of two typists, in return for which the
Smithsonian library will later provide manuscript cards for the
items in these collections, as well as in its other collections, that are
not in the library of Congress. These cards will be prepared pri-
marily for the national catalogue that is in progress there under the
direction of Dr. Ernest C. Richardson, consultant in bibliography
and research.

The generous contribution of material (see “Gifts,” p. 124) that
was received during the year from the American Association for the
Advancement of Science was carefully checked up and many of the
items were selected to fill gaps in the sets of serial and society pub-
lications. The rest of the contribution will be used in various ways
later.

Most of the uncatalogued Russian publications were looked over
and those with Roman titles were entered in the catalogue; the rest
were put aside, to be sent, with other publications in Russian,
Turkish, and Japanese, and probably some in Hungarian, Polish, and
Bohemian, to the Smithsonian deposit, that they may be made
available to scholars, and cards prepared for them in due course and
returned to the Institution.

The organization of the west stacks in the Smithsonian Building
was considerably advanced. Many thousands of college and univer-
sity publications, not needed by the library, were sent to the Bureau
of Education, where they would be at hand for completing sets and
for exchange. The files of popular and semipopular periodicals,
which had for many years been kept in these stacks, were trans-
ferred, through the courtesy of the curator of textiles, to a room in
the basement, to await final disposal. The geological material was
brought together and arranged. The publications that lay in heaps
on the floors were grouped roughly on the shelves. This work was
all preliminary to the final step in organizing this heterogeneous
mass, which contains almost countless items of value, many of which,

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 133

it will probably be found later, will serve a purpose either in the
library of the Institution or in other Washington libraries. ‘Those
that will not, will be used for exchange toward further completing
the Smithsonian collections.

During the year the librarian gave 14 public lectures and addresses,
2 on the Smithsonian Institution, the others on literary and educa-
tional subjects. In addition to his three regular reports, namely,
to the Secretary of the Institution, the Assistant Secretary in charge
of the National Museum, and the Librarian of Congress, he prepared
for the Secretary two special reports, entitled, respectively, ‘“ The
Smithsonian Library—an Interpretation” and “Accomplishments of
the Smithsonian Library, 1924-1928.” In connection with the latter
_ he checked up and listed the special collections in the library. He

- also contributed descriptions of the various libraries in the Smith-
sonian library system to the ‘“* Handbook of Washington’s Informa-
tional Resources ”—a recently published directory of libraries in the
District of Columbia; and prepared a bibliography of significant
works in American history and literature for one of the French
colleges.

REPORT OF EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE 155

The secretary recalled to the board that at the meeting of Febru-
ary 17 last it was stated that the Research Corporation had indicated

The Vice President congratulated the secretary upon this result,

mitted a detailed statement of the financial needs of the Institution.

ommendation in regard to the campaign for the endowment fund

the board for consideration and, after discussion, the following
resolution was adopted:

Resolwed, That the matter of increasing the unrestricted endowment fund be
placed in the charge of Mr. Frederic A. Delano, with power to appoint the

members of a committee who shall aid him in perfecting and executing plans
for this purpose.

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1928

a

ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Genera Aprenprx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions, reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution, and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such
papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific
progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previously had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geol-
ogy, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology,
and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not alto-
gether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them origi-
nal) embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and
discussion. This method has been continued in the present report
for 1928.

THE WIDER ASPECTS OF COSMOGONY !

Bynes lew, JAN Se SeGh russ.

{With three plates]

Interest in scientific cosmogony is a recent and still a very tender
growth. Anthropologists and geologists tell us that man_ has
existed on earth for something like 300,000 years; we must go this
far back to meet our apelike ancestry. Between them and us some
10,000 generations of men have walked the earth, most of whom have
probably given some thought, in varying degree, to the significance
of their existence and the plan of the universe.

Of these 10,000 generations of men, the first 9,990 unhesitatingly
regarded the earth as the center, and terrestrial life as the central
fact, of the universe. As was suited to its majesty and dignity as
the abode of man, the earth stood still while the celestial sphere spun
around it, covering in the earth much as a telescope dome covers in
the telescope; and this dome was spangled with stars, which had
been thoughtfully added so as not to leave the central earth unillu-
mined at night. Ten generations at most have been able to view
the problem of their existence in anything lke its proper astronom-
ical perspective.

THE POSITION OF MAN IN THE UNIVERSE

The total age of the earth far exceeds the 300,000 years or so of
man’s existence. The evidence of geology, and of radioactivity in
rocks in particular, shows that it must be something like 2,000 million
years, which is several thousand times the age of the human race.
Old Mother Earth must regard man as a very recent apparition
indeed; he has just appeared to burrow into her, burn her forests,
put her waterfalls into pipes, and generally mar the beauty of her
features. If he has done so much in the first few moments of his
existence, she may well wonder what is in store for her in the long
future ages in which he is destined to labor on her surface.

For in all probability the life in front of the human race must
enormously exceed the short life behind it. A million million years
hence, so far as we can foresee, the sun will probably still be much as
now, and the earth will be revolving round it much as now. The
year will be a little longer, and the climate quite a lot colder, while
the rich accumulated stores of coal, oil, and forest will have long
been burned up; but there is no reason why our desendants should
not still people the earth. Perhaps it may be unable to support so
large a population as now, and perhaps fewer will desire to live on
it. On the other hand, mankind, being three million times as old
as now, may—if the conjecture does not distress our pessimists too
much—be three million times as wise.

Looked at on the astronomical time scale, humanity is at the very
beginning of its existence—a newborn babe, with all the unexplored
potentialities of babyhood; and until the last few moments its interest
has been centered, absolutely and exclusively, on its cradle and feeding
bottle. It has just become conscious of the vast world existing out-
side itself and its cradle; it is learning to focus its eyes on distant
objects, and its awakening brain is beginning to wonder, in a vague,
dreamy way, what they are and what purpose they serve. Its interest
in this external world is not much developed yet, so that the main
part of its faculties is still engrossed with the cradle and feeding
bottle, but a little corner of its brain is beginning to wonder.

Taking a very gloomy view of the future of the human race, let
us suppose that it can only expect to survive for 2,000 million years
longer, a period about equal to the past age of the earth. Then, re-
garded as a being destined to live for threescore years and ten, hu-
manity, although it has been born in a house 70 years old, is itself
only 3 days old. But only in the last few minutes has it become con-
scious that the whole world does not center round its cradle and its
trappings, and only in the last few ticks of the clock has any adequate
conception of the size of the external world dawned upon it.

For our clock does not tick seconds, but years; its minutes are the
lives of men. A minute and a half ago the distance of a star was
first measured and provided a measuring rod for the universe. A
quarter of a minute ago, Hertzsprung and Shapley showed how the
peculiar stars known as Cepheid variables provide a longer measuring
rod, and taught us to think in distances so great that light takes
hundreds of thousands of years to traverse them. With the very
last tick of the clock, Hubble, using the same measuring rod, has
found that the most remote objects visible in the biggest telescope on
earth are so distant that light, traveling 186,000 miles a second, takes
about 140 million years to come from them to us.

Not only is our vision of the universe continually expanding, but
also it is expanding at an ever-increasing rate. Is this expansion des-

COSMOGONY—JEANS 167

tined to go on forever? So far as we can at present see, no; for a
general guiding principle, that of generalized relativity, fixes a
limit, which we are fast approaching. According to this theory,
space can not extend forever; it has no limit, but is nevertheless finite
like the surface of the earth. Without exploring and surveying the
whole of the earth’s surface, we can make a fair estimate of its total
area by measuring its radius, which we can do by measuring its
curvature at any one point. In the same way the total volume of
space is fixed by a quantity, the curvature of space, which can be
determined by measuring the density of distribution of matter in
space. Space which contained no matter would go on forever, but
the parts of space we can survey with our telescopes contain enough
matter to show that we already see an appreciable fraction of the
whole of space. It is as though our baby, watching ships coming
from over the horizon, concluded that the earth’s surface was curved
and formed a general rough conception of its size by imagining the
observed curvature continuing until the earth’s surface rounded back
on itself.

Exact figures are impossible, but Hubble has calculated that space
is not likely to extend to more than about a thousand times as far
as the farthest nebula visible in the biggest telescope. Nothing pre-
vents our going on and on in space beyond this distance, but if we
do we merely come back to ourselves. The possessor of a sufficiently
sensitive wireless apparatus may emit signals and pick them up a
seventh of a second later after they have traveled round the world.
In the same way a not inconceivable increase in the size of our tele-
scopes would take us around the whole of space, and we should see

the stars surrounding our sun by light which had traveled round the

universe, not of course as they now are, but as they were 100,000

million years ago.

Such considerations make it improbable that the expansion of the
universe can continue at its present rate for much longer. Having

grasped that the world is round, the infant speedily forms a fair
idea of its size. Our particular infant, mankind, has made the great
discovery of the existence of the outer world, has formed some con-

ception of its size, and adjusted his ideas, not by a process of slow
revelation, but by a brain flash of the last few seconds. In his
mature years and his staid old age he is no doubt destined to make
many sensational discoveries, but he can never again live through

the immortal moment at which he first grasped the immensity of the

outer world. We only live through a few ticks of his clock, and
fate might have ordained that they should be anywhere in the three
days that the child has already lived, or in the 70 long, and possibly
tedious years yet to come. The wonderful thing is that she has
168 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

selected for us what is, perhaps, in some ways the most sensational
moment of all in the life of our race.

The child sets its newly awakened mind to work to adjust and
coordinate a new array of facts. If the world was not made to
surround its cradle, what purpose can it serve? If the lights of the
great ships in the harbor were not designed to light its nursery at
night, what can they possibly be for? And, most interesting prob-
‘em of all, if the world is such a big affair, can there be other cradles
and other babies?

These remarks will have served their purpose if they suggest that
what I am rashly trying to set forth here should not be judged as a
finished science or the solution of a problem; it is rather the first
confused gropings of the infant mind trying to understand the world
outside its cradle. And if the impression produced by its first inex-
perienced glance at the outer world had to be described in a single
word, it would probably select the word “immensity.”

THE IMMENSITY OF SPACE

The immensity of space is measured by the figures already men-
tioned. Light and wireless signals travel at the same rate because,
of course, they are essentially the same thing; and this thing takes
a seventh of a second to travel round the world, and probably some-
thing like 100,000 million years to travel round the universe. ‘The
ratio of these times (2101) measures the dimensions of the uni-
verse in terms of the familiar dimensions of the world; incidentally,
it also measures the expansion of our spatial ideas since Copernicus.
The disparity of size is too great to be easily visualized.. Suppose
the size of our earth were represented by a single atom. Then the
range of vision of the biggest telescope is about represented by the
whole earth, and the size of the whole universe, according to the
theory of relativity, is represented by a stack of 1,000 million earths.

Scarcely less bewildering than the immense extent of space is the
immense amount and variety of matter it contains. The sun, which is
a million times as big as the earth and three hundred thousand times
as massive, proves to be something less than a grain of sand on the
seashore. It forms one of a family whose number must certainly be
counted in thousands of millions; Seares has estimated it at 30,000
millions. This is not the only family of stars in space. Each of the
great spiral and other extragalactic nebulae, such as are shown in
Plates 1, 2, and 3, is either a family of stars, or consists of stars in the
making, or of matter which is destined ultimately to form stars.
We can estimate the masses of these great nebule by gravitational
means, and each is found to contain enough matter to make 1,000
million suns. This of itself will give some conception of the vast

COSMOGONY—JEANS 169

size of these nebulz, but to tell the whole story, it must be added that
their colossal masses are so tenuous that each millionth part of an
ounce is, on the average, as big as the Matterhorn. Think of a body
which is bigger than the Matterhorn by as much as 1,000 million suns
is heavier than a millionth part of an ounce, and we have the size of
any one of these great nebule. Any one of the three photographs
here reproduced would have to be enlarged so as to cover the whole of
Asia before a body of the size of the earth became visible in it at all,
even under the most powerful of microscopes.

Hubble estimates that about 2,000,000 such nebule are visible in
the great 100-inch telescope at Mount Wilson, and that the whole
universe has abcut a thousand million times the volume of that part
of space visible in this telescope. Let us now multiply 1,000 million
by 2 million, and the product by 1,000 million. The answer (2 10°)
wives some indication of the probable number of stars in the universe ;
the same number of grains of sand spread over Engiand would make
a layer hundreds of yards in depth. Let us reflect that our earth is
one millionth part of one such grain of sand, and our mundane affairs,
our troubles and our achievements, begin to appear in their correct
proportion to the universe as a whole.

While the stars may fairly be compared to grains of sand in num-
ber, they differ too much inter se for the comparison to be carried
further. There is an enormous variety of big and little stars, of
bright and faint stars, of red and blue stars, and of hot, hotter, and
still hotter stars. The faintest of known stars (Wolf 359) emits only
a fifty thousandth part of the light of the sun, while the brightest
(S. Doradus) emits three hundred thousand times as much light as
the sun. The smallest known star (Van Maanen’s star) is about the
size of the earth; a million such stars could be packed inside the sun
and leave room to spare. The largest known star (Betelgeuse) is so
large that 25 million suns could be packed inside it. Their ranges
are greater than those between a searchlight and a glowworm, or
between balloons and birdshot.

Yet the stars are essentially similar structures. A normal atom
consists of a central nucleus round which a number of electrons re-
volve like planets round the sun—a miniature solar system, in fact,
in which the vacant space far exceeds that occupied by matter.
With great heat the electrons begin to break loose and fly off at a
tangent. The central temperatures of the stars can be calculated
with fair precision, and prove to be so high that most of the clectrons
must have already broken loose from their atoms. Of recent years,
a great deal of labor has been devoted to testing the hypothesis that
practically all the electrons have so broken loose, the stripped atoms
and electrons flying about in a general hurly-burly like the molecules
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

of a gas. But the hypothesis has proved disappointing, and a much
more probable hypothesis is, 1 think, that the atoms are not stripped
quite bare, but that in most stars they retain a few rings of electrons
which give the atoms so much size that they jostle one another about
like the molecules of a liquid. This hypothesis explains beautifully
the otherwise puzzling fact that stars of large mass fall into distinct
eroups of what may almost be described as “ standardized ” sizes.
On the “ liquid-star * hypothesis, these different sizes correspond to
the different sizes possible for the stellar atoms which may have 0,
1, 2, or 3 rings of electrons left, but can not have fractional numbers.
The largest stars of all, such as Betelgeuse, have three rings left,
while minute stars, such as Van Maanen’s star, consist of atoms most
of which are stripped quite bare, so that there is almost no limit to
the closeness with which they can be packed together. An average
handful of the matter of which this star is composed would contain
about 10 tons.

Thus the observed sizes of the stars proclaim the secret of the
structure of the atom. The sizes of the stars are discontinuous
because the sizes of atoms broken down to different stages are dis-
continuous. These discontinuities can be traced in turn to the discon-
tinuities which form the central feature of the new quantum dy-
namics. Thus the distinguishing characteristic of the laws which
govern the most minute processes in nature is transmitted directly
into the large-scale phenomena of astronomy and governs the dis-
tribution of the huge masses of the stars. ‘The infinitely great is
never very far from the infinitely small in science, but it would be
hard to find a more sensational illustration of the unity of science
than that I have just given.

On this hypothesis, not only do the observed sizes of the stars dis-
close the general structure of the atom, which is old knowledge, but
they also reveal the detailed structure of the particular atoms of
which the stars are composed, and this is new knowledge. To be
precise, the observed sizes of the stars disclose the atomic weights of
the stellar atoms; they indicate that the stellar atoms are probably
rather heavier than the heaviest atom, uranium, known on earth.
The atoms which reveal their presence in stellar spectra are, of course,
atoms of the ordinary terrestrial elements—hydrogen, iron, calcium,
and the like. These, being the lightest atoms in the star, must natu-
rally float up to its surface, and as the earth was originally formed
out of the surface of the sun the earth is necessarily composed of
them. But it now appears likely that down in the depths of the
stars are other unknown and heavier atoms. We may almost say
that it must be so, for no terrestrial atoms, not even radium or
uranium, can produce anything like the amount of energy which these
stellar atoms are observed to produce.

COSMOGON Y
THH IMMENSITY OF TIME

The immensity of space is paralleled by that of time. We can
estimate the ages of stars from the impression that time has made
upon them, just as we estimate the age of a tree from the number of
subdivisions of its stem, or of rings in its cross section. ‘There are
three principal methods of doing this. The orbits of binary stars,
which are circular at birth, are gradually knocked out of shape by
the forces from passing stars. As we can calculate the rate at which
this process occurs, the shape of stars’ orbits can be made to reveal
their ages. The moving clusters provide a second method. Groups
of bright stars such as the Great Bear, the Pleiades, Orion’s Belt,
are often found to consist of exceptionally massive stars which move
in regular orderly formation through a jumble of slighter stars, like
a flight of swans through a confused crowd of rooks and starlings.
Swans, however, are conscious beings and continually adjust their
flight so as to preserve their formation. ‘The swanlike stars can not
do this, so that their orderly formation must in time be broken by the
gravitational pull of other stars. When this happens, the lighter
stars are naturally knocked out of formation first, while the most
massive stars retain their formation longest. This agrees with what
is observed, and as we can calculate the time necessary to knock out
the lighter stars, we can at once deduce the ages of those which are
left in. A third method of investigation rests upon a rather abstruse
dynamical theorem, which shows that after a sufficient time the
energies of motion of the different types of stars must tend to
equality, the little stars making up for the smallness of their mass
by the rapidity of their motion. Seares has shown that the stars
near the sun have nearly attained to this ideal state, and as we can
calculate the time needed to establish it we can again deduce the ages
of the stars.

It is gratifying and significant that all three lines of investigation
lead to the same result: The stars are found to be some millions of
millions of years old, perhaps from 5 to 10 millions of millions.
We can not state their age with much precision, but it is the general
order of magnitude, not the exact figure, that is important.

STELLAR RADIATION

Year after year, century after century, for millions of millions of
years, the sun radiates enough energy from each square inch of its
surface to keep a 50-horsepower engine continually in action; still
hotter stars may radiate as much as 30,000 horsepower per square
inch. If this energy were produced by the combustion of coal, the
stars would all be completely burnt out in a few hundreds or thou-
172 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

sands of years. Where, then, shall he find a source of energy to
last millions of millions of years?

More than 20 years ago I directed attention to the enormous
store of energy made available by the annihilation of matter, by
positive and negative electrons falling into and annihilating one
another, thus setting free the whole of their intrinsic energy as
radiation. On this scheme neither energy nor matter had a perma-
nent existence, but only a sort of sum of the two; each was, the-
oretically at least, convertible into the other. Whether energy ‘s
ever transformed into matter we do not know; probably not. But
the falling together of electrons and protons forms the obvious
mechanism for the transformation of matter into energy, and it
now seems practically certain that this is the actual source of the
radiation of the stars. A beam of radiation exerts pressure on
any surface it falls upon, just as a jet of water does or a blast of
air. The reason is that radiation carries mass about with it, and
electromagnetic theory tells us the amount of this mass. For ex-
ample, we can calculate that a searchlight which is radiating 50
horsepower of energy is discharging mass into space with the radia-
tion at the rate of a gram and quarter a century; with sufficiently
delicate adjustments it might even be possible to observe the recoil
of the searchlight. Indeed, the pressure of radiation has actually
been measured although not in this particular way. New mass is of
course being continually fed into the searchlight by the electric
current.

Each square inch of the sun’s surface is in effect a searchlight
discharging radiation into space at the rate of 50 horsepower, and
so is discharging mass at the rate of a gram and a quarter a century,
and the sun’s surface is so large that the sun as a whole is discharg-
ing mass into space at the rate of 250 million tons a minute. Now
the sun has no source of replenishment. It must have weighed
360,000 million tons more yesterday than to-day, and by to-morrow
will weigh 360,000 million tons less. These are not mere speculative
statements; they rest on observation, and on generally accepted
principles which are directly confirmed by observation.

Allowing for the fact that a more massive star emits more radiation
than a less massive one, we can calculate that 5 or 10 million million
years ago the sun must have been several times as massive as it is
to-day, so that it has already lost most of the mass it had at birth.
Of each ton it had at birth only a few hundredweights at most re-
main to-day. The loss of mass which accompanies radiation is,
then, no mere academic hairsplitting. It is a real astronomical
phenomenon, and young stars must be many times as massive as
old stars.

ees

COSMOGONY—JEANS 173

There is a certain amount of direct evidence of this change of
mass. The radiation of the stars imposes an endlessly recurring
capital levy upon their masses, which, as observation shows, 1s
graduated and increases very steeply indeed for the richest stars.
The levy makes all the stars poorer, but it also tends to equalize what
wealth remains; the older the stars get, the more nearly equal their
impoverished masses become. This is a large part of the reason
why the stars are nearly equal in mass. The process is most clearly
marked in the binary systems, which have been formed by a single
star breaking into two. The two component stars of such a system
are necessarily of the same age, and it is a matter of observation
that the small stars of old systems are nearer to equality of mass
than the massive stars of young systems.

Thus observation and theory agree in indicating that the universe
is melting away into radiation. Our position is that of polar bears
on an iceberg that uas broken loose from the ice pack surrounding
the pole, and is inexorably melting away as the iceberg drifts to
warmer latitudes and ultimate extinction.

Five million million years ago the sun had stored up within itself
che energy which was destined to provide its light and heat until to-
day, and the mass of this energy was many times the present mass of
the sun. No means is known by which so much mass could be
stored except in the form of electrons and protons. Thus we must
suppose that the radiation of the sun through these millions of
millions of years has been produced by the annihilation of electrons
and protons which existed in it originally, but no longer exist now.
These electrons and protons are pure bottled energy; the continu-
ous breakage of these bottles in the sun sets free the radiation
which warms and lights our earth, and enough unbroken bottles
remain to provide light and heat for millions of millions of years
to come.

The amount of energy made available in this way is amazing.
The annihilation of a pound of coal a week would produce as much
energy as the combustion of the 5,000,000 tons a week which are
mined in the British Isles; an ounce of coal a month would provide
locomotive power for all the British railways, while a single drop
of oil would take the Mawretania across the Atlantic. When we
speak of the efficiency of a steam engine as 5 per cent or so, we
regard complete use of the thermal energy of combustion as 100
per cent efficiency. If we measure the work done against the total
intrinsic energy of the fuel as made available by its complete anni-
hilation, the efficiency is more like 0.00000001 per cent. On this
scale the efficiency of the sun and stars is exactly 100 per cent.

.
174 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

Modern physical theory shows that the annihilation of an electron
must produce a single flash of radiation of wave length far shorter
than any we can produce on earth. As this radiation threads its way
through a star its wave length is continually increased, or to use
the technical term the radiation is continually softened. In time it
becomes y radiation, then hard X radiation, then soft X radiation,
and finally it emerges from the surface of the star as ordinary light
and heat. Consider, however, an clectron which is annihilated, not
inside a star but outside in free space, or in one of the almost trans-
parent nebule. The short wave-length radiation now undergoes no
softening, but travels on until it meets something capable of checking
it. Thus all astronomical bodies, including the surface of the earth,
cught to be under continual bombardment by radiation of shorter
wave length, and consequently of greater penetrating powers, than
any we can produce on earth.

Many years ago such radiation was detected in the earth’s atmos-
phere by McLennan, Rutherford, and other observers; it has recently
been studied in detail by Millikan and others. There is no reason
to doubt that it originates just where it ought to, namely, in the
great nebulz, and its amount is about what it ought to be if it is
evidence of the whole universe melting away into radiation. The
wave length of the radiation might be expected to reveal the physical
process by which it is generated, but the evidence is a bit puzzling.
The hardest terrestrial radiation penetrates inches of lead and
corresponds to a voltage of hundreds of thousands of volts. The
cosmic radiation penetrates about 5 yards of lead, and the hardest
rays are now found to correspond to about 60,000,000 volts.t. Millikan
was at one time inclined to attribute the rays to the combination
of 4 atoms of hydrogen to form an atom of helium, but rays so
produced would only be of the hardness corresponding to 30,000,000
volts. There ave many ways known to physics of softening radia-
tion, but none of hardening it. Thus we must look for some source
more energetic than the synthesis of hydrogen into helium, and I
can see no possible stopping place short of the annihilation of
matter. Again, we are not dealing with a minute phenomenon of
mere academic interest. In a sense this radiation is the most funda-
mental physical phenomenon of the whole universe, most regions of
space containing more of it than of visible light or heat. Our
bodies are traversed by it night and day. Short of going down
into a mine or in a submarine we can not escape it, and it is so
intense that it breaks up several million atoms in each of our bodies
every second. It may be essential to life or it may be killing us.

1 Added in proof: The recent complete theory of Klein and Nishina gives about
940,000,000 volts, which is precisely the voltage to be expected if the rays originate in
the annihilation of matter—J. H. J.

THE LIVES OF THE STARS

The stars are almost certainly born in nebule of the type of the
great extragalactic nebule, such as are shown in Plates 1, 2, and 3.
These nebule show a great variety of shapes, but a single thread
connects them all; they are the shapes of huge masses of gas endowed
with different amounts of rotation. So definitely is this the case that
when Hubble recently tried to classify the shapes of these nebule,
deliberately and avowedly shutting his eyes to all theoretical con-
siderations, he found that purely observational considerations com-
pelled him to classify them in precisely the sequence I had predicted
on theoretical grounds some 10 years earlier.

A huge mass of gas which was entirely devoid of rotation would,
of course, assume a strictly spherical shape; rotation would flatten
this shape out, just as the earth is flattened by its rotation, until
ultimately most of the matter was spread out in a thin disk. We
see the process beginning in Plate 1, and it is well advanced in
Plate 2. Plate 3 shows a nebula which is probably physically similar
to that shown in Plate 2, but viewed from another angle. Now,
mathematical theory shows that the thin disklike structure could not
remain a mere featureless mass of gas. Just as the cooling of a
cloud of steam causes it to condense into drops of water, so the
cooling of a cloud of gas causes it to condense into detached masses.
We see the phenomenon in progress in nebular photographs; it is
a necessary theoretical conseauence of the laws of gases and the law
of gravitation.

Now, the same theory which predicts that the phenomenon must
happen predicts the scale on which it will happen. We can calculate
how much matter will go to the formation of each “drop,” and the
calculated masses of the drops come out to be just about the same
as the masses of the stars. Indeed, these drops are stars, and the
process just described is that of the birth of stars. Unmistakable
stars have been observed in the outer regions of many of the spiral
nebulz. It is naturally not possible to identify every observed
spot of light with a star, but some of them show precisely the same
peculiar fluctuations of light as characterize a certain class of
variable star, the Cepheid variables already mentioned, and these
put the identity of these particular spots of light beyond all reason-
able doubt.

In these nebule, then, we are watching the birth of stars, the
transformation of an inchoate mass of gas into an “ island universe ”
of stars. Indeed Hubble found it necessary to end up his classifiea-
tion of nebule with clouds of stars. At one end of his continuous
sequence is a nebula shaped like a mass of rotating gas, in which not
a single star is visible; at the other end a star cloud in which nothing
176 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,. 1928

but stars are visible. Our galactic system of stars is probably the
final product of just such a transformation, the Milky Way still
recording the position of the equatorial plane of the original nebula.

Stars born in this way may meet with a variety of accidents, and
these result in different observed astronomical formations. A star
may rotate too fast for safety, just as a flywheel may; when this
happens it breaks into two, and the two stars so formed revolve
endlessly about one another as a binary system. Two stars may run
into one another, although this is very rare. A more common occur-
rence is for two stars to escape running into one another by a narrow
shave. When this happens, huge tides are raised on the two stars
involved, and these may take the form of long streamers of gas, which
ultimately condense into “ drops ” just as did the gas in the outlying
regions of the spiral nebule. It seems reasonably certain that the
planets were formed in this way.

The birth of the solar system, then, resulted from the close ap-
proach of two stars; if a second star had not happened to come close
to our sun, there would have been no solar system. It may be thought
that with a life of millions of millions of years behind it, one star
or another would have been certain to come near enough at some
time to tear planets out of the body of our sun. Calculation shows
the reverse; even after their long lives of millions of millions of
years, only about 1 star in 100,000 can be surrounded by planets bern
in this way. A quite unusual accident is necessary to produce planets,
and our sun with its family of attendant planets is rather of the
nature of an astronomical freak.

In the 1,000 million stars surrounding our sun there are, at a mod-
erate computation, not more than 10,000 planetary systems, because
there has not been time for more than this number to be born. They
are of course still coming into existence; calculation suggests a birth-
rate of about 1 per 1,000 million years. Thus we should have to visit
thousands of millions of stars before finding a planetary system of
us recent creation as our own, and we should have to visit millions
of millions of stars before finding a planet on which civilization and
interest in the outer universe were as recent a growth as are our
own. We are standing at the first flush of the dawn of civilization
and are terribly inexperienced beings. 5

It may be suggested that the creation of planetary systems is also
only beginning, and that in time every star will be surrounded, lke
our sun, by a family of planets. But no; the stars will have dissolved
into radiation or disappeared into darkness before there is time for
this to happen. So far as we can judge, our part of the universe has
lived the more eventful part of its life already; what we are witness-
ing is less the rising of the curtain before the play than the burning

out of candle ends on an empty stage on which the drama is already
over. There is not time for many more planets to be born.

LIFE AND THE UNIVERSE

The planets are the only places we know where life can exist. The
stars are too hot; even their atoms are broken up by the intense heat.
Nebuiz are in every way unsuitable; even if cool solid bodies exist in
them, they would probably be so drenched with highly penetrating
radiation as to render life impossible. Life demands a special type
of matter, such as does not produce intense light and heat by trans-
forming itself into radiation. We find it only in the surfaces of the
stars, which are too hot for life, and in the planets which have been
pulled out of these surfaces.

On any scheme of cosmogony, life must be limited to an exceedingly
small corner of the universe. To our baby’s wonderings whether
other cradles and other babies exist, the answer appears to be that
there can at best be very few cradles, and there is no conceivable
means of knowing whether they are tenanted by babies or not. We
look out and see a universe consisting primarily of matter which is
transforming itself into radiation, and producing so much heat,
light, and highly penetrating radiation as to make life impossible.
In rare instances special accidents may produce bodies such as our
earth, formed of a special cool ash which no longer produces radia-
tion, and here life may be possible. But it does not at present look as
though nature had designed the universe primarily for life; the
normal star and the normal nebula have nothing to do with life ex-
cept making it impossible. Life is the end of a chain of by-products;
it seems to be the accident, and torrential deluges of life-destroying
radiation the essential.

There is a temptation to base wide-reaching inferences on the fact
that the universe as a whole is apparently antagonistic to hfe. Other
quite different inferences might be based on the fact of our earth
being singularly well adapted to life. We shall, I think, do well to
avoid both. Each oak in a forest produces many thousands of
acorns, of which only one succeeds in germinating and becoming an
oak. The successful acorn, contemplating myriads of acorns lying
crushed, rotten, or dead on the ground, might argue that the forest
must be inimical to the growth of oaks, or might reason that nothing
but the intervention of a special providence could account for its own
success in the face of so many failures. We must beware of both
types of hasty inference.

in any case our 3-days-old infant can not be very confident of
any interpretation it puts on a universe which it only discovered a
178 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

minute or two ago. We have said it has 70 years of life before it,
but in truth its expectation of life would seem to be nearer to 70,000
years. It may be puzzled, distressed, and often irritated at the
apparent meaninglessness and incomprehensibility of the world to
which it has suddenly wakened up. But it is still very young; it
might travel half the world over before finding another baby as young
and inexperienced as itself. It has before it time enough and to spare
in which it may understand everything. Sooner or later the pieces
of the puzzle must begin to fit together, although it may reasonably
be doubted whether the whole picture can ever be comprehensible to
one small, and apparently quite insignificant, part of the picture.
And ever the old question obtrudes itself as to whether the infant has
any means of knowing that it is not dreaming all the time. The pic-
ture it sees may be merely a creation of its own mind in which nothing
really exists except itself; the universe which we study with such care
may be a dream, and we brain cells in the mind of the dreamer.

THE STARS IN ACTION?

By Atrrep H. Joy

This is an age of action. Progress and change are the order of
the day. Illustrated papers which can be read at a glance, motion
pictures for entertainment and instruction, and the ever-increasing
speed of locomotion by motor cars and airplanes indicate the popt-

lar tendency. Public interest and attention are rapidly diverted

from one activity to another. The ever-changing array of passing
heroes is the result of a common desire for novel activity in many
lines of effort. No matter how fine the museum exhibit of the re-
sults of art or industry, the crowds of young and old turn away to

surround the display with a mechanical adaptation which shows

some actual process at work.

Among the stars the lover of astronomy finds a fascinating story
of activity which claims his supreme interest. The heavenly bodies
reveal to the present-day scientist the irresistible charm of action
in many different aspects, from the tremendous bustle of atoms and
electrons to the stately movement of giant orbs three hundred times
the diameter of our sun.

Probably the recognition of life, especially intelligent life, on the
moon or one of the planets would be the astronomical discovery that
would evoke the greatest popular interest. In 1835 the New York
Sun printed an account of life on the moon which purported to
come from the observations of Sir John Herschel with a new mam-
moth telescope 24 feet in aperture located at the Cape of Good
Hope in South Africa. It was a most clever hoax, depicting forms
of life on the moon far different from those existing on the earth.
Trees, animals, and flying men were described in detail, and their
habits of life as observed were skillfully pictured. These stories
were continued in installments on several successive days. The office
of the Sun was stormed for copies and back numbers. New York
was almost frantic. All other topics of conversation were forgotten.
In a few days the Sun, which had been established only two years,

had the largest circulation of any newspaper in the world at that
time.

In recent years, on account of the failure to find any signs of life,
the study of the moon has been rather neglected by the large observa-
tories. For many years Mars has held the limelight of public inter-
est because of the possibility of life there. Recent observations
point to daytime temperatures favorable to life, but the nights are
excessively cold. Very meager amounts of atmosphere and water
vapor have been observed. In the sun and stars, all of which have
immensely high surface temperatures extending from 2,000° to
25,000° C., there is, of course, no possibility of life, for there all
chemical compounds, with few exceptions, are dissociated. In the in-
teriors even the atoms are broken up. The astronomer must confess
that he can not point with certainty to any form of life except on
our tiny earth. Nevertheless, much of interest is found in the physi-
cal activity of the stars.

The earliest astronomical discoveries were connected with the
bodies of the solar system and their movements, real or apparent.
After noting the daily rising and setting of the sun and stars and
the monthly changes of the moon’s phases and positions, as well as
occasional eclipses and comets, probably the first facts of astronomy
to be observed were the motions of the planets and the yearly motion
of the sun among the stars. Previous to the invention of the tele-
scope some attention was given to the position and brightness of
stars, but they were considered to be fixed in position and with few
exceptions constant in brightness.

With the invention of the astronomical telescope by the immortal
Galileo, intense interest, such as has never been felt at any other
time in the history of science, was awakened in astronomy. The
theoretical researches of Kepler and Copernicus appealed to a few
scientists and philosophers, but actually to see with the eye the
Milky Way and star clusters resolved, the spots moving across the
face of the sun, the satellites revolving around the planet Jupiter,
and to note the changing position of the rings of Saturn were facts
of such engrossing interest and concern to everyone that the prevail-
ing authority of the church and science were alike shaken to their
foundations because at that time they had no room for new facts in
their established dogmas.

The desire to know more of the stars led observers to make increas-
ingly accurate records of the positions and the brightness of the
stars, which resulted in the discovery that the stars are not at all fixed
in position but have individual motions and that some of them
even vary in brightness. These simple observations some 200 years
ago were the beginnings of modern observational astronomy. ‘The
motions of the stars furnish data for studying the unfverse as a

THE STARS IN ACTION—JOY 181

whole, while the discovery of variation of brightness was the first
step in the study of the stars as individual entities.

The total motion of a star may be resolved into two components,
one toward or away from the observer in the line of sight, called
radial velocity, and the other at right angles to it, known as proper
motion. Radial velocity of stars was thought indeterminable 60
years ago, but the use of the spectroscope—that beautiful optical
appliance which, by analyzing light and spreading it out into its va-
rious wave lengths and colors, has meant so much to astronomy and
physics in the last 50 years—has made it possible to measure the
velocities of the stars in the line of sight. Distance does not mat-
ter, provided only the star is bright enough to record its light rays on
the photographic plate. The largest telescope can photograph the
spectra of stars as faint as the tenth or eleventh magnitude and de-
termine their velocities from single plates.

Proper motion can be observed by noting the positions of stars as
compared with their positions observed 10, 50, or 100 years before.
The largest proper motion known is that of Barnard’s star, a faint
star of the tenth magnitude, which moves among its neighbors at the
rate of 10 seconds of arc a year. This motion would carry it across

‘a space equal to the moon’s apparent diameter in 180 years. Al-

though it seems slow, yet such is the extreme accuracy of modern
photographic methods that the motion could be detected on plates

separated by a time interval of only 24 hours. On account of their
great distances most stars have proper motions which are compara-
tively insignificant, as far as short periods of time are concerned.
The nearer stars have, on the average, the greater proper motion

because they mark out greater angular distances in the sky as they

move.

With proper motion and line-of-sight velocity known, we can

calculate the total motion in space of those stars whose distance

can be determined. Space motions are the foundations of the
study of the structure and dynamical behavior of our universe.

They give a clue to the origin and relationships of stars which can

be found in no other way. For the nearer stars, at least, it ap-
pears that there is a tendency to move through space in groups at
certain speeds and in certain directions. Many such groups, com-

posed of a few hundreds or thousands of stars, are known among

our nearer neighbors. Smaller groups composed of three or four

stars, or even two stars, are numerous. These have the same motion

in space and revolve about each other in orbits, as the moon revolves

about the earth. They can usually be resolved by the telescope and

ean be observed as they leisurely describe their orbits in periods

varying from a few years to many centuries. A number of the
24034—29 13

182 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

binary stars are so close together that they appear single as seen from
the earth, even with the most powerful telescopes, and their duplicity
is known only by the fact that their orbital motions in the line of
sight are shown by the spectroscope. Many of these spectroscopic
binaries have periods less than a day, and the two stars of the pair
are so close together that they almost touch each other. Our Milky
Way system, comprising billions of stars, is made up of such smaller
groups, while it, in turn, seems to be a larger unit, a cluster or perhaps
a spiral nebula, with a definite motion as a whole.

Another activity of the stars which has had an increasing import-
ance in astronomy since it was first discovered is the variation of
total luminosity as seen from the earth. This enticing field of obser-
vation has been so attractive to all interested in the heavens that
hundreds of amateurs all over the world are devoting their time and
talents to the observation of stellar hight changes. The thrill of see-
ing one of the lucid stars of the sky periodically dimming or en-
hancing its brightness is an experience never to be forgotten. The
study of stellar variation has been not only a hobby or useful diver-
sion for the amateur, but has commanded the efforts of nearly all the
greatest astronomers of the last hundred years. The brighter stars

have been observed with the naked eye; the fainter ones have required
the most powerful instruments that could be had. Much time is being.

given to these objects at the largest observatories. About one-third of
the time of the 100-inch telescope is now being devoted to variable
stars of different kinds.

The first scientific record of variation among the stars seems to be
that concerning the appearance of Tycho Brahe’s new star, or nova,
in 1572. ‘This was a very bright nova, appearing in Cassiopeia at a
point where no star had been known before. It was as bright as
Venus at its brightest and could be seen in the daytime. After a
few months it disappeared from view, as there were no telescopes at
that time to follow it further. On account of the lack of accurate
observations of its position, it can not certainly be located at the pres-
ent time, but it is probably identical with a faint star of the four-
teenth magnitude. It has therefore decreased in brightness at least
17 magnitudes, or six million times, since its historic and record-
breaking outburst.

Some 50 nove or temporary stars have appeared since that time.
The number has increased with the use of better instruments and
with the aid of photography. Many recall Nova Aquilz which was
discovered on June 8, 1918, as a first-magnitude star. Photographs
show that for 30 years previous it was an unknown and inconspic-
uous eleventh-magnitude star in the Milky Way. Some time about
June 6 the crisis of its history occurred. The next day it had
increased in brightness a hundredfold and was doubling its bright-

THE STARS IN ACTION—JOY 183

ness in an hour’s time. On the following evening, June 8, having in-
creased another hundredfold, it was independently discovered within
a few hours after it rose above the eastern horizon by a score of
astronomers and amateurs in Europe and America. This remarkable
example of the careful watch of the sky which is being maintained
at all times leads us to believe that not many bright nove have
escaped observation in recent years. ‘The outburst reached its max-
imum on June 10 when the star was equal to Canopus in brightness,
being second only to Sirius itself. To know the real time of the
outburst about 1,000 years must be subtracted from the date of its
appearance, for the star is so far away that it takes that time for its
light to reach us.

After its maximum the decline set in, but at a much slower rate
than the rise. What was gained in brightness in the 2 days before
maximum was lost in 200 days, and after that the decline was even
slower. It took about 2 years to return to normal intensity after its
4 days of dissipation.

The spectrum showed remarkable changes of a character observed
only in novae. At maximum, and presumably before, it resembled
the spectrum of a hot, massive star but with the lines greatly dis-
placed, indicating that the star was expanding at the terrific rate of
over 1,000 miles per second. In spite of this immense expansion to a
million times its original volume, the high temperature of over
10,000° was maintained so that the surface brightness did not change
much until after maximum. ‘The increase in ght seems to have been
largely the result of an increase in the dimensions of the star itself.
The outburst was, in effect, an explosion.

Soon after maximum a gaseous shell was formed, which has con-
tinued to increase in diameter for nine years up to the present time.
It now forms a neat ring of gas about the star similar to the ring
nebula in Lyra, but about one-fourth its apparent size. Whatever
may be the cause of the sudden outburst, we have observed in this
case the actual formation of a ring or planetary nebula in an insig-
nificant interval of time, astronomically speaking. A truly amaz-
ing phenomenon has taken place before our very eyes. The delib-
erate processes of celestial evolution have become a spectacle of ac-
tivity and change, speeded up, as it were, so that in the minute
span of time loaned to man for his mundane existence he may behold
and ponder an example of the splendor of creation.

As the shell of gas is thrown off from the star at a speed a thou-
sand times that of a projectile from a “big Bertha,” the character
_ of its radiation changes rapidly. In the emptiness of space, the atoms
of the shell are cooled so that they would not be able to radiate at
' all were it not that the intense ether waves of the central star are
continually bombarding them from behind and rousing them to
184 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

activity. The physicists tell us that the atoms are absorbing the
ether waves which overtake them and are re-emitting the energy re-
ceived in certain definite rays. Of course only the lightest elements
are thrown out of the star, and the rays which we actually observe
are those proceeding from hydrogen, helium, and nebulium atoms.
This latter is a hitherto unknown gas which Bowen has recently
shown to be merely oxygen and nitrogen, the elements so well known
in our own atmosphere. They were not recognized previously
because such rays could not be produced in the limited coniines of
the laboratory.

The cause of nove outbursts, which are the most violent of all stellar
activities, is still uncertain. We know much of the results of the
explosion, but the underlying cause can only be conjectured. Possibly
an encounter with nebulosity or another body may start the generation
of internal energy in large amounts near the surface of the star. It
can not be a deep-seated effect, for it is too sudden and ephemeral.
The central portions of the star are probably not affected by the great
display at the surface.

Only a few years later than Tycho’s famous nova, the first periodic
variable star was noted. In 1596 Fabricius, a Flemish clergyman,
noticed that the red star Omicron in the constellation Cetus, the whale,
was bright for a few months and then dropped below the limit of visi-
bility. He doubtless thought it a nova. It was 40 years before its
periodic character was discovered. Continued observation showed
that it returned to maxima easily visible to the naked eye every 330
days; that it was visible about 5 months and too faint to be seen for
6 months; and that its rise to maximum was about twice as rapid as
its decline. Because of its extraordinary behavior it was called Mira,
the wonderful. This name it has richly deserved, for it continues to
show peculiarities which can not be predicted and which are little un-
derstood. Its variations are somewhat uncertain but average about
six magnitudes or two hundred and fifty fold increase from minimum
to maximum light.

Although it received its name largely because of the surprise in-
duced by its periodic character and its great range of brightness, its
behavior as studied by the spectroscope has been even more wonderful,
and it has perplexed observers since its spectrum was first observed
more than 40 years ago. There are several facts in connection with
the star and others of its class which are of special interest. Its ap-
parent diameter is the largest thus far measured with the inter-
ferometer, and its real diameter, three hundred and fifty times that
of the sun, is second only to that of Antares. If brought to our solar
system and set in place of the sun, its boundaries would extend be-
yond the orbit of Mars, and the earth in its yearly motion would de-

THE STARS IN ACTION—JOY 185

scribe its orbit not much more than one-half the distance from the
center to the circumference. If its mass were proportionately large,
it would weigh twenty-five million times as much as the sun, and
according to Hinstein’s theory its own gravitation would be so great
that its light would be unable to leave its surface. The mass has not
been directly determined, but it is probably about five or ten times
that of the sun, instead of several million times. This low value
means that we have an exceedingly large body with comparatively
small mass, and the density comes out surprisingly low. It is, in fact,
on the average for the whole star, only one ten-thousandth that of our
atmosphere at sea level. ‘The outer regions which we see have a much
ereater tenuity, for a star’s mass is greatly concentrated toward the
center. These regions are much nearer to a perfect vacuum than any-
thing that can be produced in the laboratory. As far as our experi-
ence goes these stars are vast aggregations of nothingness. The po-
etical idea of tripping lightly from one star to another would be
difficult of realization in such cases, for we might approach one of
these giant bodies of gas and, except fan the inconvenience of a rather
torrid temperature of 2,000° or more, we might wander about indefi-
nitely inside the star and not even know that we had arrived. If we
wished to use an airplane, we should fall to the center of the star and
yet find no place where it could support itself as it does in the air of
the earth. At the surface, gravity is very small on account of the
ereat distance from the center of the star. It amounts to only one-
thousandth that on the earth. If one could get a solid footing there,
he could jump to a height of a mile.

Mira and the other long-period variables are the coolest stars we
know. ‘The temperatures of the regions which we see vary with the
brightness of the star from 1,600° to 2,500° centrigrade, absolute. Its
red color is easily noted by the eye. A limit of stellar temperature
