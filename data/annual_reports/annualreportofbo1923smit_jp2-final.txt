OF THE
SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
CuarLes D. WALcoTT

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1923

Z'o the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith the customary
annual report showing the activities and condition of the Smith-
sonian Institution and its branches during the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1923. The first 26 pages of the report contain an account
of the affairs of the Institution proper, with brief abstracts of the
work carried on by the various branches of the Institution, while
Appendixes 1 to 10 give more detailed reports of the operations of
the United States National Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the
Freer Gallery of Art, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the
International Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, the
Astrophysical Observatory, the United States Regional Bureau of
the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, the Smith-
gonian Library, and of the publications of the Institution and its
branches.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting
the trust Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and therefore
constituted an “ establishment ” whose statutory members are “ the
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of

the executive departments.”

2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The affairs of the Institution are administered by a Board of
Regents whose membership consists of “ the Vice President, the Chief
Justice, three Members of the Senate, and three Members of the
House of Representatives, together with six other persons other than
Members of Congress, two of whom shall be resident in the City
of Washington and the other four shall be inhabitants of some State,
but no two of them of the same State.” One of the Regents is
elected chancellor by the board; in the past the selection has fallen
upon the Vice President or the Chief Justice; and a suitable person
is chosen by them as secretary of the Institution, who is also secre-
tary of the Board of Regents and the executive officer directly in
charge of the Institution’s activities.

In regard to the personnel of the board, the following changes
occurred during the year: Robert Walton Moore, Member of the
House of Representatives from Virginia, was appointed a Regent
by the Speaker of the House, to succeed the late Lemuel P. Padgett.
Mr. Henry White was reappointed by joint resolution of Congress,
Mr. Irwin B. Laughlin, of Pennsylvania, was appointed to succeed
the late Dr. A. Graham Bell, and Mr. Frederic A. Delano, of the
District of Columbia, to succeed Mr. John B. Henderson, who died
during the year. The election of Representative Frank L. Greene
to the Senate on March 4, 1923, automatically terminated his term
as a Regent.

The roll of Regents at the close of the fiscal year was as follows:
Calvin Coolidge, Vice President of the United States, Chancellor;
William H. Taft, Chief Justice of the United States; Henry Cabot
Lodge, Member of the Senate; A. Owsley Stanley, Member of the
Senate; Medill McCormick, Member of the Senate; Albert Johnson,
Member of the House of Representatives; R. Walton Moore, Member
of the House of Representatives; George Gray, citizen of Delaware;
Charles F. Choate, jr., citizen of Massachusetts; Henry White, citi-
zen of Washington, D. C.; Robert S. Brookings, citizen of Missouri;
Irwin B. Laughlin, citizen of Pennsylvania; and Frederic A. Delano,
citizen of the District of Columbia.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

A systematic campaign was begun during the year to increase the
endowment of the Institution to more adequate preportions though
at the close of the year this has had no material success. It is felt
that there is considerable misunderstanding throughout the country
regarding the resources of the Smithsonian Institution, many per-
sons believing that it is supported, at least to some extent, by the
Government. As a matter of fact, though the Congress appropriates
funds annually for the maintenance of the various bureaus which
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 3

have grown up around the Institution and are administered by it, not
one cent from these appropriations can be used by the Institution
proper for the purpose for which “ pes created, “ the i mnerease and
diffusion of knowledge among men.’

These purposes, which are carried out through research, explora-
tion, and publication, must be supported by the funds of the Institu-
tion itself or by money contributed for special purposes by the friends
of the Institution. As the endowed funds of the Institution, con-
sisting of the original bequest to the Nation of James Smithson
and subsequent gifts and bequests, amount to only a little over a mil-
lion dollars, yielding an available annual income of approximately
$60,000 from which the administrative costs of the Institution and of
the general direction of its seven branches must be paid, it will be
readily apparent that but little remains each year for research and
exploration. It is believed that if the financial situation of the
Smithsonian Institution and its excellent position for carrying on
needed scientific work were more fully understood, there would be
ready response to its plea for a larger endowment, and its program
of scientific research and exploration could then be expanded and
pushed vigorously, to the ultimate benefit of mankind.

An outstanding event of the year was the formal opening on May
2, 1923, of the Freer Gallery of Art, the culmination of Mr. Charles
L. Freer’s splendid gift to the Nation, through the Smithsonian In-
stitution, of his unrivalled collections of American and Oriental art
and a beautiful building to house them. The opening was well
attended and was the cause of favorable comment in art circles
throughout the country, many of the leading art journals carrying
full accounts of the gallery and its contents. The building is now
open to the public daily except Mondays.

FINANCES

RESEARCHES AND EXPLORATIONS

In the Institution’s work in the “ increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge,” scientific exploration and research expeditions in the field play
an important part. There has been even more than the usual activity
in this phase of the work during the past year, the Institution and
its branches having initiated or taken part in 22 separate expeditions
in widely scattered parts of the earth, representing many branches
of science. The very limited funds of the Institution available for
this important work make it necessary each year to forego oppor-
tunities to send out or join forces with other scientific organizations
in expeditions which would result in valuable information and ma-
terial for study and exhibition to the public in the National Museum.
I will mention here only a few of the expeditions in the field during
the past year, in order to show the nature and scope of the work,
referring to the appended reports on the National Museum, Bureau
of American Ethnology, and other branches of the Institution for
accounts of the explorations undertaken by them.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY t
GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS IN THE CANADIAN ROCKIES

My geological field work in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, de-
seribed in previous reports, was continued during the past year,
special attention being given to securing evidence bearing on the
pre-Devonian formations north of the Bow Valley, Alberta, and
south along the new Banff-Windermere motor road. Difficulties were
encountered during the first part of the season, owing to dense
forest-fire smoke and unsatisfactory trail men, but during August
and September conditions were greatly improved and the work was
pushed vigorously.

A fine section of pre-Devonian strata was studied and measured
in the upper part of Douglas Lake Canyon Valley, and many pho-
tographs were secured. The measured geologic section was from the
base of the Devonian, above Lake Gwendolyn, across the canyon to
the deep cirque below Halstead Pass, where the great Lyell lime-
stone forms the crest of the ridge. The section includes the Ozarkian
Mons formation down to the Lyell formation of the upper Cambrian.

Going south from the Bow Valley, camp was next made on the
Kootenay River, about 6 miles below the mouth of the Vermilion
River. The Kootenay Valley is broad and deep, with the high
ridges of the Mitchell Range on the east and the Brisco Range on
the west. The limestones and shales of both ranges are upturned and
sheared and faulted, making it very difficult to work out the structure
and the complete stratigraphic succession of the various formations.
The Silurian limestones, with their fossil coral beds above the white
quartzite of the Richmond transgression, were found in the upper
portion of Sinclair Canyon, and not far away black shales full of
Silurian graptolites. Lower down the canyon thin-bedded gray
limestone yielded fossils of the Mons formation.

It is evident that in the ancient and narrow Cordilleran Sea, that
extended from the Arctic Ocean 2,000 miles (3,218 km.) or more
south, between the coast ranges of the time and the uplands of the
central portion of the North American continent, there was a sim-
ilarity of Lower Paleozoic marine life along the shores and its shal-
low waters. Evidences of this and of strong currents and persistent
wave action occur all the way from central Nevada to Mount Robson,
in British Columbia. The record of the marine life and deposits
of mud and sand is most complete.

PALEONTOLOGICAL FIELD WORK IN TENNESSEE

Dr. R. S. Bassler, curator, division of paleontology of the United
States National Museum, spent six weeks in June and July in a con-
tinuation of stratigraphic and paleontologic studies begun a year
before in the central basin of Tennessee, in collaboration with the
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Tennessee State survey. In 1921 the study and mapping of the
Franklin quadrangle, an area of about 250 square miles just south
of Nashville, was well advanced, and this year it was brought to com-
pletion and data secured for the preparation of a geological report
upon the area, to be published by the State. Stratigraphic studies
were then undertaken in contiguous areas, in which Doctor Bassler
was joined by Doctors Ulrich and Mesler. The classic section at
Nashville, in which the proper delimitation of the formations has
long been in dispute, was studied with especial care, and large col-
lections of fossils were secured to verify the stratigraphic results.

Regarding this section, Doctor Bassler says:

The deep-sea origin of all limestones has long been taught in spite of the
trend of evidence that many limestone formations were laid down in shallow
seas. The shallow-water origin of limestone is well illustrated in the sec-
tion of Ordovician strata exposed near the blind asylum at Nashville, which
has been studied by several generations of geologists. At the base of this
section is the Hermitage formation, which was evidently formed along ancient
shore lines because it is composed of beach-worn fragments of shells and other
fossils. Above this comes the Bigby limestone, the source of much of the
Tennessee brown phosphate, and which also is made up almost entirely of the
comminuted remains of fossils. Next is the Dove limestone, an almost pure,
dove-colored, lithographic-like limestone which shows its shallow-water origin
in the worm tubes penetrating it and its sun-cracked upper surface. A slab
of this limestone a foot thick, now on exhibition in the National Museum,
well illustrates the polygonal upper surface and the penetrating worm tubes,
both features indicative of the origin of the rock on old mud flats which were
periodically above water and thus became sun cracked. The succeeding Ward
limestone is of the more typical blue variety, but here the rock is filled with
millions of fossil shells which, under the influence of weathering, are changed
to silica and are left free in great numbers in the soil. This section is only
a portion of the entire geological sequence at Nashville, but it well illustrates
the various types of limestone outcropping throughout the central basin.

EXPEDITION TO EXAMINE THE NORTH PACIFIC FUR SEAL ISLANDS

Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, head curator of biology in the United
States National Museum, was detailed at the request of the Depart-
ment of Commerce, to accompany an expedition to Alaska and
adjacent regions during the summer of 1922 to ascertain the status
of the fur seal herds in the North Pacific Ocean since their protection
through the treaty of 1911 between the United States, Russia, Japan,
and Great Britain. The first seal rookeries visited were those of the
Pribilofs, where the increase in number of seals on the beaches is
very remarkable, and Doctor Stejneger predicts a complete resti-
tution of the fur seal herd to its former maximum for the not dis-
tant future. A new method of stripping the skin from the dead seal
and subsequent cleaning of the skin was being adopted on an ex-
tensive scale and was found to be a great improvement over the old
method.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9

On Bering Island of the Commander Islands, the next stop of the
expedition, conditions were quite the reverse of those on the Pribi-
lofs. The south rookery had long since ceased to exist and the great
north rookery had been greatly reduced. On his last visit to this
rookery in 1879, Stejneger had estimated the number of breeding
seals there at 30,000. At the time of the present visit, there were
scarcely 2,000 left.

The expedition next visited the Japanese fur seal island usually
known as Robben Island in the Okhotsk Sea. Here the number of
fur seals has gradually increased until now they occupy not only the
entire eastern beach but are extending the rookery at both ends on
to the west side of the island. The Japanese have followed closely
the methods employed in managing the American seal herd on the
Pribilofs, and the result is most instructive in showing conclusively
that “protection does protect.” Important information regarding
the Russian fur seal islands was obtained from Mr. Koltanovski and
Colonel Sokolnikof, and from Yokohama Doctor Stejneger took
passage back to the United States, having completed the inspection
of the fur seal rookeries.

BOTANICAL EXPLORATION IN COLOMBIA

From April to October, 1922, Dr. Francis W. Pennell, of the Phil-
adelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, and Mr. Ellsworth P. Killip,
of the National Museum, carried on botanical exploration in the
Republic of Colombia. The expedition was organized by several
institutions as part of a general plan for the botanical study of
northern South America. Financial assistance was also given by
Mr. Oakes Ames, who was especially interested in the orchids of the
region.

Entering the country at Buenaventura on the Pacific side, the
expedition established headquarters at La Cumbre in the Western
Cordillera, for the purpose of studying the vegetation of the central
part of this range. Descending to the city of Cali, the party pro-
ceeded up the Cauca Valley to Popayan, and from this point explored
the southern portions of both the central and western Cordilleras.
Later the expedition visited Salento, in the northern part of the Cen-
tral Range, and Ibagué and Bogota, collecting material at historic
localities along the Quindiu Trail. Approximately 7,200 members
were collected, sufficient material being secured to make up equal
sets for each of the institutions represented in the expedition.

In his report on the work, Mr. Killip says:

As might be expected from its physiography, the vegetation of Colombia is
extremely diverse. Within a few miles may occur a luxuriant tropical flora,
the more open woods of the temperate zone, and the low alpine growth familiar

on our American mountain tops. Again, as in the Dagua Valley, one may ride
through a dense rain forest, filled with ferns, mosses, and aroids, to emerge
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

suddenly in an arid desert-like region, where cacti and acacias are the con-
spicuous plants. -

So inadequately known is the flora of Colombia that even along the regular
routes of travel many species are found that are either new, unrepresented in
American herbaria, or known only from specimens preserved in European
collections.

The botanical collection resulting from this expedition is one of
the largest and most important ever obtained in Colombia.

EXPLORATION OF THE PALEOLITHIC REGIONS OF FRANCE AND SPAIN

During September, 1922, Mr. M. W. Stirling, of the National
Museum, explored the paleolithic regions of southern France and
northern Spain. Besides visiting all of the important sites where
remains of ancient man have been discovered, the expedition entered —
a great many caves previously unknown to science. Regarding the
great promise of the region for archeological work, Mr. Stirling
reports as follows:

The idea has become prevalent in America that this region has been practi-
cally exhausted archeologically. Although the previous existence of paleo-
lithic man in this locality has been known for half a century, it may be truly
said that the work of exploration has hardly begun.

The habitations of the Stone Age are closely linked with the limestone forma-
tion which overlies large areas in this part of Europe. These may be said to
fall into two classes, i. e., rock shelters and caverns. The former are under-
cuts in the limestone made by the rivers in the early Pleistocene or late Plio-
cene. A general elevation of the land has caused the streams to*deepen their
channels, thus leaving the undercuts well above the surface of the water.
These were utilized as dwelling places by paleolithic man and in many instances
were artificially modified. There are literally miles of relic-bearing deposits
of this class that have not yet been touched. The possibilities in this field are
very great.

The caverns of the Dordogne region are for the most part comparatively
small, while those in the department of Arriege are immense caves of a most
spectacular nature. Of the former class are the grottoes of Font du Gaume,
Combarelles, La Mouthe, Marsoulas, Montesquieu, and others. Of the latter
class are the immense caves in the neighborhood of Foix, as for example, Salig-
nac, Ussat, and Niaux. The tunnel of Mas d’Azil is the remnant of such a cave.

Many of these caverns have become blocked with sediment owing to the fact
that they frequently slope downward from the entrance. Messrs. Stirling and
Patton entered at least a dozen such caves which had become sealed at varying
distances from their mouths. The opening of such caves has heretofore been
left entirely to chance. Scientific endeavor at this work should produce most
fruitful results. The sealing of these caves has been a fortunate accident of
nature, since the contents are by this means preserved intact.

Of the regions visited, that in the neighborhood of Altamira, in Spain, and
Ussat, in France, give most promise of rich returns to the archeologist.

CENTENARY OF THE BIRTH OF SPENCER FULLERTON BAIRD

A meeting was held in the auditorium of the National Museum
on the evening of February 3, 1923, to celebrate the centenary of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY lal

birth of Spencer Fullerton Baird, second secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution, the virtual founder of the United States National
Museum, the creator and head of the United States Fish Commis-
sion, and a prime mover in the establishment of the United States
Geological Survey and the Bureau of American Ethnology. The
meeting was presided over by Representative Frank L. Greene, a
member of the Board of Regents of the Institution, and the following
addresses were delivered: “ Baird, the man,” by Dr. William Healey
Dall; “Baird and the Smithsonian Institution and its branches,”
by Dr. Charles G. Abbot; “ Baird at Woods Hole,” by Prof. Edwin
Linton; “ Baird and the Fisheries,” by Prof. David Starr Jordan;
and “ Baird, the Naturalist,” by Dr. C. Hart Merriam.

In the afternoon, preceding the formal celebration, the National
Baird Memorial Committee met in the National Museum to decide
upon the form of the memorial or memorials to Baird. The com-
mittee was composed of delegates appointed by 54 scientific societies
and institutions from various parts of the country, with the follow-
ing officers:

Honorary president, Dr. William H. Dall; president, Dr. Charles
D. Walcott; vice presidents, Mr. George R. Agassiz, Dr. Alexander
Graham Bell (deceased), Prof. Frank W. Clarke, Prof. Stephen
A. Forbes; Prof. David Starr Jordan, Prof. Edwin Linton, Prof.
Edward S. Morse, Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn, Prof. Addison
KE. Verrill, and Dr. Robert S. Woodward; secretary, Dr. Paul
Bartsch. At this afternoon meeting it was announced that appro-
priate exercises were held during the morning, when wreaths were
placed on the grave of Baird in Oak Hill Cemetery, the bust of
Baird in the American Museum of Natural History, the Baird
memorial bowlder of the American Fisheries Society at Woods
Hole, and the Baird memorial tablet at the Bureau of Fisheries
Building in Washington, and that the mayor of Reading, Pa., had
been requested to decorate the house in which Baird was born.

The report of the national committee, announced at the evening
meeting, is as follows:

1. That Congress be memorialized to establish in the city of
Washington a museum of fisheries and oceanography, with labora-
tories and a public aquarium, as a memorial to Spencer Fullerton
Baird.

9. That there be established a fund for the encouragement of
research and exploration in the directions in which Spencer Fuller-
ton Baird was a leader.

3. It was the sense of the meeting that the name of Baird be given
- to the laboratory of the Bureau of Fisheries at Woods Hole, Mass.
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923
PRESENTATION OF BUST OF JEANNE D’ARC

On February 23, 1923, there was presented to the Smithsonian
Institution for the American people a bronze bust of Jeanne d’Arc
by Madame Berthe Girardet, of Neuilly, France. This bust, accepted
by your secretary on behalf of the Board of Regents of the Institu-
tion, is a gift from the sculptress through Mrs. Grace Whitney Hoff,
“in memory of what the American soldiers did in France at a
crucial time of need—in gratitude to the mothers, to the wives, to
the sisters and sweethearts, and to all those who gave their dear
ones whose blood has mingled with the soil of France.” The bust
is installed in the National Gallery of Art.

HAMILTON FUND LECTURE

The Rev. James Hamilton, in 1875, placed under the administra-
tion of the Smithsonian Institution a sum of money, designated as
the Hamilton fund, the interest from which is to be used for “lec-
tures on scientific or useful subjects.” Under the auspices of this
fund there was delivered on April 18, 1923, an interesting lecture
by Dr. Sven Hedin, the noted Swedish explorer, on his discoveries
of ancient cities and manuscripts in eastern Turkestan and his latest
explorations in southern Tibet. The lecture was profusely illus-
trated with lantern slides, and Doctor Hedin described graphically
the dangers and hardships incident to a journey through the great
desert regions in which he worked. The lecture, to which the Wash-
ington public was invited, had a large attendance.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATURE STUDY EXHIBIT

Four of the foyer rooms in the New National Museum have been
set aside for a local exhibit, which, it is hoped, will meet a long-felt
want of teachers and students and people generally interested in the
fauna and flora of the District of Columbia and its immediate
vicinity.

Two of the rooms are devoted to the birds and it is intended to
install a complete representation of all species reported for the Dis-
trict. A third room is devoted to the mammals, reptiles, batrachians,
and fish of the District, while the fourth room has the commoner in-
sects—butterflies, dragonflies, beetles, etc——and swinging frames
containing beautifully pressed specimens of local plants. It is in-
tended to change the contents of these frames as the season advances,
so that anyone wishing to know what is in flower at the particular
time in question will find the specimen represented in the frame in
its regular systematic position, as well as a photograph of the habitat
and some detail pictures. Here, too, is installed a stereomotorgraph
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 13

which alternately shows series of pictures of plants and birds, the
plants as they come into flower and the birds about their nest, feed-
ing stations, or bird baths.

Judging from the attendance which these exhibits have already
called forth and the numbers of inquiries which have been made by
teachers and persons interested, there is no question about the ad-
visability of having furnished the school system and nature lovers
of Washington these aids to visual education.

TWENTIETH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF AMERICANISTS

The twentieth meeting of the International Congress of Ameri-
canists, held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August, 1922, was attend-
ed by Dr. Walter Hough and Dr. Ales Hrdlitka, of the National
Museum, who represented the Smithsonian Institution and were also
designated by the State Department to represent the United States.
Means were provided to repay the expenses of the delegates by the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. A great many papers
of scientific value were presented in several languages at the Con-
gress, and the delegates feel that a great stimulus was given to the
promotion of anthropological science, especially in Brazil.

PUBLICATIONS

The Institution and its branches issued during the year a total of
100 volumes and pamphlets, of which there were distributed 139,666
copies, including 130 volumes and separates of the Smithsonian Con-
tributions to Knowledge, 18,801 volumes and separates of the Smith-
sonian Miscellaneous Collections, 25,229 volumes and separates of
the Smithsonian Annual Reports, 3,016 Smithsonian special publica-
tions, 72,529 volumes and separates of the publications of the Na-
tional Museum, 17,694 publications of the Bureau of American Eth-
nology, 816 publications of the National Gallery of Art, 1,309 vol-
umes of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, 31 reports
on the Harriman Alaska Expedition, and 74 reports of the American
Historical Association.

Through its publications the Institution carries out one of its
primary functions, the “ diffusion of knowledge among men.” Many
of its publications are the results of scientific researches conducted
by members of the staff, others are prepared by outside scientists
who have carried on special investigations on the collections of the
National Museum and still others are intended for the general reader
who takes an interest in the progress of science but is not benefited
by the more technical papers mentioned above. In this last class
‘comes the General Appendix to the Smithsonian Annual Report,
which consists of a series of articles by authorities in the matters
treated, outlining the more noteworthy and interesting advances in
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

many lines of scientific work, including physics, chemistry, astro-
physics, geology, biology, and anthropology. These are written in a
style to attract the average intelligent reader, and there is a very gen-
eral demand for the reports. A cataloguer in the office of the Super-
intendent of Documents, where all public documents are distributed,
has placed the Smithsonian report first in point of number of re-
quests from libraries to receive this publication.

The publications of the National Museum and of the Bureau of
American Ethnology are mentioned in detail in the report on pub-
lications, appended hereto.

Nine papers were issued during the year in the series of Smith-
sonian Miscellaneous Collections, among which may be mentioned
one by your secretary resulting from his geological field work in the
Canadian Rocky Mountains; a timely paper by Mr. Mitman, of the
Museum staff, on “Some Practical Aspects of Fuel Economy ”;
and a contribution from Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, chief of the Bureau
of American Ethnology, on the “ Designs on Prehistoric Pottery
from the Mimbres Valley, New Mexico,” which was fully illus-
trated with striking Indian designs.

Allotments for printing.—The congressional allotments for the
printing of the Smithsonian reports and the various publications of
the branches of the institution were practically used up at the close
of the year. The appropriation for the coming year ending June
30, 1924, totals $77,400, allotted as follows:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

Committee on printing and publication—The function of the
Smithsonian advisory committee on printing and publication is to
make recommendations to the secretary regarding the technical merit
and suitability of all manuscripts submitted for publication by the
Smithsonian Institution or its branches, and also to consider all
other matters relating to printing and binding under the institution.
During the past year seven meetings were held and 104 manuscripts
acted upon. The membership of the committee is as follows: Dr.
Leonhard Stejneger, head curator of biology, National Museum,
chairman; Dr. George P. Merrill, head curator of geology, National
Museum; Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, chief, Bureau of American Eth-
nology; Mr. N. Hollister, superintendent, National Zoological Park;
and Mr. W. P. True, editor of the Smithsonian Institution, secre-
tary.

LIBRARY

Much has been accomplished during the year toward better
library service. The number of publications loaned during the year
reached a total of 12,076, and fully as many were consulted without
being taken out. A list has been prepared each day of the principal
contents of scientific and technical periodicals received for the Smith-
sonian Deposit at the Library of Congress, and copies are circulated
among the heads of scientific bureaus under the Smithsonian Insti-
tution. The subject catalogue of the Museum library has been
increased by 4,400 cards, and progress has been made in the arrange-
ment of cards of the Concilium Bibliographicum, received since the
close of the war.

The third volume of the “ Bibliography of Aeronautics,” covering
the years 1917 to 1919, inclusive, compiled by the assistant librarian
of the Smithsonian Institution, Mr. Paul Brockett, was issued dur-
ing the year by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.

Of the 10,938 volumes and other publications added to the library,
5,719 were for the Smithsonian Deposit at the Library of Congress,
4,285 for the National Museum, and the others for the remaining
libraries administered under the Smithsonian Institution.

NATIONAL MUSEUM

While without increased financial resources it has been impossible
for the Museum during the year to increase the scope of its exhibits
and of their usefulness to the public, nevertheless much has been
accomplished along the lines of filling in gaps in existing collections
and of increasing their value through classification and arrangement.
.The Museum has been fortunate in being able to keep together most
of its scientific staff. Im many cases this has been possible only
because of the devotion of the persons and their willingness to accept
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

employment in what should be their leisure hours in order to meet
living expenses. Better conditions are expected to result, however,
from the passage by Congress of the reclassification act of 1923,
which becomes effective July 1, 1924.

The Museum acquired during the year a total of 217,611 specimens.
While numerically this is only 60 per cent as many as received during
the previous year, many of the accessions are of exceptional value,
either intrinsically or from a scientific point of view. The distri-
bution of duplicate specimens, mainly to educational institutions,
totaled 9,131 specimens, classified and labeled. About one-half of
these were in regular sets already prepared for shipment, and the
other half were specially selected to meet particular needs. Nearly
35,000 duplicates, chiefly relating to botany and geology, were sent
out in exchange, resulting in the acquisition of much desirable mate-
rial. Over 12,000 specimens were lent to specialists for study pur-
poses. The material received by the Museum during the year is
described somewhat fully in the report of the administrative assist-
ant in charge, appended to this report, but it may be well to here
mention briefly some of the outstanding accessions. Among much
material in anthropology, there may be mentioned an expressive
carved stone figure from the Makah Indians; casts of the famous
La Quina and Obercassel skulls and skeleton; a series of archeo-
logical specimens from Haiti; an ethnological collection from For-
mosa; and casts of the busts of the heretic Pharaoh, Amenophis IV,
and his queen.

The biological specimens received during the year, while fewer in
number, compare favorably in scientific value with those of previous
years and probably are above the average. Perhaps the outstanding
accession in biology was the Evezard collection of recent mollusks
presented by the late John B. Henderson, while another of great
scientific interest is the series of Opalinid ciliate infusorians pre-
pared by Prof. Maynard M. Metcalf. A significant feature of the
year’s accessions is the fact that some of the most important are from
China as a result of a deliberate effort to improve systematically the
study material from the Palearctic region which is of fundamental
importance for a full understanding of our North American fauna.
Several expeditions from which biological material may be expected
to come to the Museum are now in the field in China. A number of
other expeditions to South America and elsewhere during the year
have resulted in much valuable material, the National Herbarium
especially being enriched. Striking new exhibits in the department
of biology include several species of Australian mammals, a Malay
tapir, and a gorilla collected in French Congo by Mr. Aschemeier,
of the Museum staff. The scientific staff has continued to carry on
research work on the study collections, resulting in the publication
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 17

of many papers in the various Museum series. The total number of
specimens of animals and plants now in the Museum collections is
estimated to exceed 7,000,000.

Among the important accessions in the department of geology may
be mentioned the valuable paleontological collection of the late
Orestes St. John, consisting principally of fossil fishes, donated by
Dr. Frank Springer, and a collection of not less than 10,000 speci-
mens, mainly fossil plants, presented by the heirs of the late R. D.
Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa. The residuary portion of the meteorite col-
lection of the late Prof. H. A. Ward was presented by Mrs. Coonley
Ward, and 18 additional accessions of meteorites were received. A
number of important mineralogical specimens were acquired, largely
through exchanges, including a portion of a large boulder of jade
received from Col. W. B. Thompson and a fine specimen of crystal-
lized descloizite from southwest Africa. Several unusual cut gems
were purchased through the Chamberlain endowment fund. An
important phase of the work of the department of geology consists
in furnishing assistance to schools and students, chiefly through the
distribution of materials needed in their studies. Eighty-one educa-
tional institutions were thus aided during the year.

The collections of textiles, wood technology, organic chemistry,
foods, and medicine, all under the supervision of the curator of
textiles, received many valuable specimens, numbering over 2,000.
Among the most important of these are a large series of specimens
of pyralin, bakelite, condensite, and cellulose acetate, all substitutes
for natural raw materials, such as ivory, bone, horn, tortoise shell,
amber, etc., the supplies of which are growing scarcer every year;
beautiful specimens of silks, woolen fabrics, and mohair upholstery
textiles; an exhibit showing the process of manufacture of double-
tipped matches; and specimens showing the use of chaulmoogra oil
derivatives in the treatment of leprosy in Hawaii.

In the divisions of mineral and mechanical technology, graphic
arts, and history, an unusually large and valuable series of objects
has been accessioned during the year. The divisions of mineral and
mechanical technology, in their conservation program, cooperated
with Mr. S. S. Wyer in preparing a work under the title “The
Smithsonian Institution’s Study of Natural Resources Applied to
Pennsylvania’s Resources,” which was distributed free to school
teachers throughout Pennsylvania and used in certain courses in the
grade schools. Seven loan exhibits shown in the division of graphic
arts brought the division prominently before the local public, and two
traveling exhibits prepared in the division were shown in various
cities. The division of history received, besides several other im-
portant accessions of military, naval and antiquarian material, the
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

entire collection of numismatic material formerly exhibited in the
United States mint in Philadelphia, transferred to the Museum
owing to the closing of the mint to the public.

A number of field expeditions in which the Museum was interested
resulted in greatly enriching the collections in all departments,
though mainly in biology and geology. These expeditions are de-
scribed in the report on the Museum appended hereto. The usual
large number of meetings, congresses, and receptions were held in
the auditorium and rooms of the Natural History Building. Visitors
to the Natural History Building totaled 508,518, to the Arts and
Industries Building, 259,542, to the Smithsonian Building, 95,168,
and to the Aircraft Building, 42,904. The Museum published dur-
ing the year 10 volumes and 42 separate papers, of which there were
distributed a total of 72,529 copies.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

In the National Gallery, the year has seen substantial advance in
a number of directions, although additions to the art collections have
not been so numerous as in several previous years. The time of the
staff has been devoted largely to the receipt, installation, and care
of the collections; to completing the records and labeling; and to the
preparation of matter for publication for the purpose of arousing
interest in the National Gallery, especially in its vital need of a
gallery building. A recent act of Congress authorizes the raising
of funds for a National Gallery Building and provides a site in the
Smithsonian Park for its erection, and the gallery has made every
effort during the year to bring forcibly to the attention of the public
the urgency of providing a suitable building to take care of the grow-
ing national art collection and to offer better inducements to pro-
spective donors to the Nation of valued art material. Furthermore,
there must be in America a National Gallery of Art Building if we
are to take a respectable place among the civilized nations of the
world in the field of art, and the director of the gallery has en-
deavored in several published articles to make known this national
shortcoming and to stir the pride of a people not accustomed to take
a second or third place in any field worthy of their ambition.

The National Gallery Commission held its second annual meet-
ing on December 12, and numerous important problems connected
with the work of the gallery and with its future were considered.
Following the reports of committees, a new committee was appointed
to look after the gallery’s interests in the final disposition of pur-
chases made from the Ranger bequest fund.

The 21 portraits of distinguished leaders of America and other
allied nations in the war with Germany, painted by a number of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY : 19

leading American pairiters under the auspices of the National Art
Committee, have now returned to the National Gallery and will re-
main on permanent exhibition, after having been displayed in 25
of the larger cities through the offices of the American Federation of
Arts.

The gallery received by gift during the year a number of paintings
and other art works, and several interesting collections were loaned,
among them the famous McFadden Collection of 43 portraits and
landscapes of the British School, which is deposited in the gallery
pending its permanent housing by the city of Philadelphia. Several
special exhibitions were held in the gallery, including an exhibition
of American Handicrafts assembled and circulated by the American
Federation of Arts, and a collection of antique Etruscan, Greco-
Roman, and Byzantine jewelry, ancient glassware, and pottery ex-
hibited under the auspices of the Archeological Society of Wash-
ington.

The first catalogue of collections to be issued since the establish-
ment of the gallery as a separate unit appeared during the year.
The catalogue contains an account of the development of the art
interests of the Smithsonian Institution and an outline of the or-
ganization of the gallery, followed by a list of the art works with
brief biographies of the artists, and is illustrated with 25 plates of
certain of the most noteworthy paintings and sculptures in the
gallery.

FREER GALLERY OF ART

The examination, classification, and preliminary cataloguing of
Chinese and Japanese stone sculptures and jades, begun in 1922, was
completed during the year. New work begun includes the prelimi-
nary cataloguing and final storage of Chinese and Japanese bronzes,
lacquers, and wood sculptures, Near Eastern and Egyptian pottery,
and miscellaneous objects of bone, ivory, metal, glass, etc. The
autumn, winter, and early spring were largely devoted to the installa-
tion of exhibits and preparations for the formal opening of the
gallery to the public on May 2, 1923.

For the opening week, there were issued 3,300 invitations, and the
gallery was then opened to the public. From May 9 until the
end of the period covered by the report of the gallery, June 30, the
tota attendance was 32,648. Beginning June 11, the building was
closed on Mondays, making the exhibitions available on Sundays to
many people who are unable to come on week days.

The field work of the gallery included a trip to Europe by Miss
Guest to attend as a delegate from the gallery the the meetings of the
Société Asiatique de Paris, held in Paris from July 10 to 18, follow-
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

ing which she devoted two months to a study of various collections
of Oriental art in France, England, and Germany. On February 12,
Mr. Bishop, of the gallery staff, left for China, in charge of an ar-
cheological expedition sent out under the joint auspices of the Freer
Gallery of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Up to the
close of the year, Mr. Bishop’s chief concern was with matters of
organization, which he has now settled very successfully. He also
visited several sites of great archeological interest and made observa-
tions of importance to the future work of the expedition.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

The chief has endeavored to expend in the most economical man-
ner the funds appropriated by Congress for “ continuing ethnological
researches among the American Indians and the natives of Hawaii,
etc.,” although considerable difficulty has been encountered owing
to the greatly increased cost of field work and maintenance. There
has been a great awakening of interest in matters concerning the
aboriginal inhabitants of America, and never before has there been
such a general demand for the published works of the bureau. The
great archeological discoveries in Egypt have created a new popular
interest in the Science of Man, and the chief is endeavoring to meet
this situation by increasing the output of the bureau in the form of
popular publications in addition to the usual technical works. The
past year’s work includes archeological and historical study of the
Indians as well as work on documentary history. Somewhat detailed
accounts of the various researches carried on during the year are con-
tained in the report of the chief of the bureau, Appendix 4 of this
report, so that it will here be necessary only to indicate the character
and scope of the work.

From July to September, 1922, the chief completed the excavation
and repair of Pipe Shrine House on the Mesa Verde National Park,
Colorado, begun the previous year. This exceptional ruin is now
open for the inspection of visitors to the park. He also excavated
and repaired Far View Tower, an instructive circular ruin with three
subterranean kivas, probably an outlook for observation of the sun
and ceremonies connected with the sky god. In June, 1923, the chief
visited various localities in the neighborhood of Deming, southern
New Mexico, for the purpose of examining and obtaining speci-
mens of a beautiful form of prehistoric Indian pottery which had
been discovered in that region. The remarkable pictures on this
pottery throw considerable light on the ethnology of an ancient
people of whom we would otherwise have practically no knowledge.

Dr. John R. Swanton completed three manuscripts for publica-
tion during the year, besides carrying on important linguistic and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 21

ethnological researches in the office. Dr. Truman Michelson began
the year conducting ethnological researches among the Fox Indians
of Iowa, where he collected sufficient material for a manuscript on
the origin of one of the Fox societies. Tribal dissensions cut short
Doctor Michelson’s stay among the Fox and he undertook a recon-
naissance among the Potawatomi of Wisconsin, the Chippewa at
Reserve in the same State, the Ottawa of Michigan, the Delaware-
Munsee of Lower Canada, and the Montagnais of Lake St. John.
In May, 1923, he left for the field to make a reconnaissance of the
Algonquian tribes of eastern United States and Canada, including
the Labrador peninsula.

Mr. John P. Harrington prepared several manuscripts for pub-
lication during the year, and carried out linguistic researches with
Mr. Cipriano Alvarado, a Quiché Indian of Guatemala. In May,
1923, Mr. Harrington went to Santa Barbara, Calif., for the pur-
pose of continuing his researches on the Indians of that State. He
secured a large quantity of manuscript material bearing on myths,
place names, historical notes, early life and customs, genealogies, and
Indian songs. He also participated in the excavation of the famous
Burton Mound on the beach at Santa Barbara, which resulted in the
discovery of a great mass of Indian skeletons, trinkets, and utensils.
Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt completed two manuscripts for publication,
and in May, 1923, left for ethnological field work among the Six
Nations of Iroquois near Brantford, Ontario, Canada, where he
elaborated and revised texts recorded there previously and also
recorded much valuable information relating to the institutions of
the league. Later he visited the Onondaga Reservation near Syra-
cuse, N. Y. Mr. Francis La Flesche was engaged during most
of the year in assembling his notes for the third volume of his work
on the Osage Tribe.

The report on the bureau then discusses, under special researches,
the work of Miss Frances Densmore on the Indian music of the
Yuma, Mohave, and Papago Tribes; the archeological investigations
by Mr. W. E. Myer of ancient Indian mounds in central Tennessee ;
archeological work on the Stratman cave in Maries County, Mo.,
by Mr. Gerard Fowke; and field studies by Mr. John L. Baer on
the banner stones and pictographs in the Susquehanna River region,
Pennsylvania.

The bureau published during the year two annual reports with
lengthy accompanying papers and two bulletins. Several other
publications were in press at the close of the year. Of the bureau
series, there were distributed during the year a total of 17,694
copies.

22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES

The total number of packages of scientific and governmental
publications sent abroad and received from foreign agencies for dis-
tribution in this country during the year was 377,826, weighing
492.816 pounds. This is a decrease in number of packages and in
weight from the previous year, owing partly to the smaller size
of the publications handled this year. These publications were for-
warded in 2,223 boxes, in addition to which 40,000 packages were
sent direct to their destinations by mail whenever a sufficient quan-
tity for box shipments had not accumulated when the regular
monthly consignments were forwarded.

Exchange relations were resumed with Roumania during the year,
the Institutul Meteorologic Central at Bucharest acting as the official
Roumanian exchange bureau. Conditions in Russia and Turkey had
not sufficiently improved at the close of the year to warrant the
establishment of official exchange bureaus in those countries, but
the Institution has arranged with the American Friends Service
Committee to forward to Russia the large accumulation of exchange
material for correspondents in that country. Seventy boxes were
thus forwarded to Russia during the year. The State Library
(Riigiraamatukogu), Reval, was designated as the exchange agency
for Esthonia.

There were sent to depositories abroad during the year 57 ful]
sets of United States official documents and 38 partial sets, and the
Congressional Record was exchanged with 44 establishments abroad.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

The actual number of animals on exhibition at the close of the
year was greater than in any previous year, and the scientific value
of the collection is greater than ever before. For the fourth suc-
cessive year the number of visitors to the park has exceeded 2,000,000,
and its value in natural history instruction is again shown by the
fact that 171 schools, classes, and other organizations visited the park
during the year, with a total of 14,185 individuals. Friends of the
park have been even more than usually generous in presenting
animals, 266 specimens having been thus added during the year.
Of special interest among these may be mentioned a number of
desirable animals presented by Mr. Victor J. Evans, including
specimens of the frog-mouth and New Guinea fruit pigeon; valuable
collections of South American animals contributed by Hon. Henry D.
Baker and Mr. William J. LaVarre; a collection of animals pre-
sented by Mr. Gordon MacCreagh, including the rare red ouakari
monkey and the matamata turtle; and a number of interesting
animals from southern Mexico collected by Dr. William M. Mann.
REPORI OF THE SECRETARY 93

At the close of the year there were in the collections a total of
1,768 animals, an increase of 87 over the previous year. This total
represents 498 different species, including 184 species of mammals,
271 of birds, and 48 of reptiles. There were born or hatched in the
park during the year 80 mammals and birds, while the death rate
has again been kept at a very low mark. Sixty-six surplus mam-
mals and birds were sent away in exchange to other zoological
gardens, which resulted in securing some-very desirable specimens
for the park.

Among the improvements undertaken during the year the super-
intendent’s report mentions the complete reconstruction of the wolf
and fox dens below the sea-lion pool, making the quarters for these
animals much more comfortable and sanitary and greatly improved
in appearance. The principal construction during the year was
the continuation of the grading of the area left vacant through the
changing of the main automobile road through the park. Here will
soon be available a large area of flat ground, on which paddocks are
being completed for Rocky Mountain goats, red deer, barasingha
deer, and Japanese deer, Indian buffaloes, tahr goats, aoudads, axis
deer, and similar species. The outdoor cages for rhesus and other
monkeys were all repaired, repairs to the ostrich inclosure were
made, and safety guards placed along the fence in front of the main
bear dens. The principal needs of the park, as enumerated by the
superintendent, are a suitable restaurant building, which has been
urged for many years, a new bird house to replace the old temporary
one, which is far too small and in very bad condition, and the es-
tablishment of a reasonable fund to enable the park to grasp the
occasional opportunities offered to secure rare and desirable animals
which otherwise it is impossible to obtain.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

The observatory now occupies a number of frame structures south
of the Smithsonian Building, at Washington; a cement observing
station and frame cottage for observers on Mount Wilson, Calif.;
an observing station at Montezuma, Chile; and a new observing
station on Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz.; the last erected from funds
donated for the purpose by Mr. John A. Roebling, of New Jersey.
At Washington no observations were attempted, but as much time
as possible was devoted to computations necessary to the following:

(1) The search for systematic errors in the work of Mount Harqua Hala,
Ariz., and the application of carefully determined eorrections thereto.

(2) The publication of a comparison of two years of observations at Mount
Harqua Hala, Ariz., and Mount Montezuma, Chile.

(3) The preparation of a new set of curves for use from January 1, 1923,
in the short method of solar constant determination at Montezuma, Chile.
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

(4) The search for systematic errors and the application of carefully de-
termined corrections to Montezuma results on the new basis.

(5) The reductions of observations made at Mount Wilson in 1922 on the
form of the solar spectrum energy curve and on the spectrum energy curves
of 10 of the brighter stars.

This large computing program has resulted in putting the two
stations on an equal footing in every possible way.

At Mount Wilson the director and Mr. Aldrich redetermined the
form of the solar spectrum energy curve, varying the procedure as
far as possible so as to get several independent checks on the results.
They also accomplished the difficult task of the observation of the
prismatic energy spectrum of 10 of the brighter stars in the focus
of the 100-inch reflector on Mount Wilson. The results of both
of these researches were published in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous
Collections, volume 74, No. 7, 1923.

The two observing stations at Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., and
Mount Montezuma, Chile, have continued in operation throughout
the year, and the results have been very numerous. They had not
been critically compared at the close of the year.

The work on solar radiation, begun in 1903, has been steadily im-
proved, until with the continuous year-round occupation for two
years of two first-rate observing stations the decisive test has been
made, proving the substantial character of solar variation. In short,
the director believes that there is no longer a reasonable doubt that
the sun varies or that the observations can reveal these variations
satisfactorily. It is now a question for meteorologists whether these
variations are of importance in weather forecasting.

Just after the close of the fiscal year some preliminary observa-
tions were made on changes in the appearance of the sun accom-
panying changes in the output of radiation. Two years of record
prints from direct photographs and spectroheliograms of the sun
made at the Mount Wilson Solar Observatory were compared with
the corresponding two-year records of solar radiation, and there
were established four general rules or principles connecting the
solar radiation with the sun’s visible appearance.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LIT-
ERATURE

In the report of the Regional Bureau of the International Cata-
logue of Scientific Literature for 1922 attention was called to an
international convention to be held at Brussels during July, 1922,
to consider the affairs of the catalogue and to the proposals to be
submitted by the Smithsonian Institution. It is satisfactory to be
able to report that at this convention these proposals formed the
basis of the resolution whereby all the countries represented agreed
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 25

to keep alive the various regional bureaus until international affairs
would allow reorganization and resumption of publication. There
‘appears to be no question of the need of an international bib-
liography of science and of international cooperation in its pro-
duction; therefore as the International Catalogue of Scientific Lit-
erature is the only such organization in existence it is the logical
foundation on which to base future operations, whether these opera-
tions are to be aided through private endowments or official
guarantees.

NECROLOGY

ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL

Alexander Graham Bell, a regent of the Smithsonian Institution
from 1898 to 1922, died at his summer home in Nova Scotia on
August 2, 1922. Doctor Bell, best known for his invention of the
telephone, was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1847, and was edu-
cated at Edinburgh and London universities. He later received
many honorary degrees from universities in this country and abroad.
A patent was granted on March 17, 1876, for his invention of the
telephone, and in 1883, with C. A. Bell and Sumner Taintor, he in-
vented the graphophone. His many other notable inventions for
the benefit of mankind include the photophone, induction balance,
and telephone probe for painless detection of bullets in the human
body.

He was deeply interested in the subject of deafness and its cor-
rection, and founded and endowed in 1887 the Volta Bureau for the
increase of knowledge relating to the deaf. He was the author of
many scientific and educational monographs.

Doctor Bell occupied a prominent place in the affairs of the
Smithsonian Institution during the 24 years of his membership on
the board of regents, serving continuously from the time of his
appointment to the board as a member of its executive committee.

The loss of his active interest and sound advice will be deeply
felt by the institution.

JOHN BROOKS HENDERSON

John Brooks Henderson, regent of the Smithsonian Institution
since 1911, died January 4, 1923, at the age of 53. Mr. Henderson
was early attracted to scientific work and shortly after his graduation
from Harvard undertook his first expedition to the West Indies in
quest of land mollusks. These, together with marine mollusks, he
made his special study, and in the course of his work he made many
collecting trips to the Greater and Lesser Antilles. His first paper on
mollusks was published in 1894, and in the succeeding years his con-
26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

tributions on this subject appeared in various journals and in the
publications of the United States National Museum. As a result of
his expeditions many thousands of valuable specimens have been *
added to the museum collections.

As a regent of the institution, Mr. Henderson took a keen and
active interest in all its affairs. During the year preceding his
death he served on the executive committee of the board of regents.

HENRY N. SPOTTSWOOD

Henry N. Spottswood, employed by the institution in various
capacities since 1889, died on December 1, 1922. Coming to the
institution as copyist in the National Museum and promoted through
various grades to clerk in the international exchange service, Mr.
Spottswood served the institution efficiently for over 33 years.

Respectfully submitted.

Cuartes D. Watcort, Secretary.
APPENDIX I
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the United States National Museum for the fiscal year end-
ing June 30, 1923.

Much has been accomplished this year along long- cent eee lines
of endeavor. Without increased financial resources to grasp the
many opportunities for widening the scope of the exhibits and of
their usefulness to the public, efforts were mainly concentrated on
filling gaps in existing collections and on increasing their value and
usefulness through classification and arrangement, the two primary
objects of the Museum as given in the fundamental act. The
Museum has continued, as in the past, to be greatly aided in this
work by workers in other governmental departments. For instance,
the Museum pays for the services of but three persons in connection

with the vast insect collection. However, this collection has had
during the year most of the time of 15 entomologists and a fluctuat-
ing number of preparators—usually about 25 persons in all. With
so many workers great progress has been made in studying and
arranging the collection. Here, as elsewhere in the Museum, prog-
ress was retarded tc a certain extent by lack of supplies, which the
Museum is unable to furnish with its very limited maintenance fund.

The organization of the Museum has been but slightly changed.
In August, 1922, the old collections of animal and vegetable products
were combined in a new section of organic chemistry in the depart-
ment of arts and industries, and an aid for that section was added to
the scientific staff.

An exchange of collections was made between two divisions of the
Museum on July 1, 1922, by which the division of history took over
the custody of tke small arms collection in the northwest court of
the Arts and Industries Building, which has been built up by the
division of mechanical technology, and the latter relieved the divi-
sion of history of the aircraft collection exhibited in the Aircraft
Building.

Great difficulty has been experienced in maintaining the quota of
watchmen necessary for guarding the buildings. The conditions
under which the watchmen are required to work here are more
onerous and exacting than in any other bureau of the Government.

27
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

With the funds at present available it has not been possible, especi-
ally since the Natural History Building has been opened on Sundays,
to grant the watchmen time off in lieu of Sundays and holidays. This
is done in some of the Government departments and every effort is
being made to secure the additional funds needed to make the watch
service in the Museum as attractive as elsewhere.

The Museum has, however, been fortunate in being able to keep
together most of its trained workers on the scientific staff. In a
number of instances this has been possible only because of the devo-
tion of the persons and their willingness to accept employment in
what should bé their leisure hours, in order to meet their current
expenses. This spirit of loyalty and devotion to the Museum is
appreciated.

A better era is anticipated. Nothing in the past has had a more
vital relation to the work ofthe Museum than the enactment by Con-
gress, on March 4, 1923, of the classification act of 1928, for a more
adequate pay schedule for the civilian employees of the Government,
with provisions for equal pay for equal services regardless of the
department in which the service is rendered. This reclassification
becomes effective on July 1, 1924, before which date much preliminary
work has to be completed. The writer was appointed liaison officer
for the Government bureaus under the institution. Tentative alloca-
tions of all the positions under the institution were made during the
latter part of the year and submitted to the personnel classification
board created to care for the matter.

The year just closed was the second under the operation of the
Budget system of estimates and appropriations, and necessarily in-
volved changes in many methods of planning and keeping accounts.
Operating as it has had to do on practically the same appropriations
for the past 10 or 15 years, the Museum has difficulty in making ends
meet, and it is only by rigid economy and by the omission of many
things that should be done that the year ends without a deficit.

The function of the National Museum as the depository of the col-
lections belonging to the United States is being recognized more, and
more, resulting, near the close of the fiscal year, in the transfer to
the Museum by the Treasury Department of the entire collection of
numismatic materials which the Government, up to a few years ago,
exhibited at the United States Mint in Philadelphia. Congress also
reaffirmed this function of the Museum in accepting the sword of
Maj. Gen. Richard Montgomery of the Continental Army, given to
the Nation by Miss Julia Barton Hunt, by directing that it be
deposited in the National Museum.

At the annual meeting of the American Association of Museums
in Charleston in April, 1923, the financial prospects were such that
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 29

arrangements were made for the establishment of headquarters in
the National Capital, with a salaried director and secretary, Prof.
Charles R. Richards and Mr. Laurence Vail Coleman, respectively.
The National Museum gave support to the movement by permitting
the association to have its offices in the Arts and Industries Build-
ing. Toward the end of the year headquarters of the association
were accordingly established on the third floor of the northwest
pavilion of that building. Professor Richards is spending his first
year on leave in order to make a survey of European museums, and
Mr. Coleman is in charge as acting director.

Three small rooms off the foyer in the Natural History Building,
which have been held exclusively for use of temporary loan ex-
_ hibits—usually in connection with gatherings in the auditorium—
were this year assigned to the department of biology for the display
of the animals of the District of Columbia. These collections, which
for lack of room had been scattered in various halls or stored away,
are now brought together and made available for students, amateurs,
and school children of Washington.

In the Arts and Industries Building a new exhibition hall was
prepared and opened to the public during the year, being a small
room on the second floor of the southeast range. Here is shown an
attractive display of historical relics received from the Military
Service Institution, including the famous horse owned by Gen. Phil
Sheridan.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

The National Museum, in its own buildings and in the Smithsonian
Building, occupies an aggregate floor space of over 670,000 square
feet, or over 1514 acres, with roof area of approximately 534 acres,
and some 2,000 windows. The upkeep is necessarily considerable,
especially when it is recalled that the Smithsonian Building has been
erected nearly 70 years, the Arts and Industries Building about 43
years, and the so-called South Shed about 25 years. The other
structures are more recent, the Natural History Building being about
14 years old and the Aircraft Building about 6. Most of the space
is used for exhibition. purposes and must at all times be kept in good
repair and in sightly condition. Constant vigilance is necessary to
properly maintain these buildings within the appropriation allotted
for the purpose, and it is only by strict economy that the present sat-
isfactory results are accomplished.

Early in the year an emergency arose, namely, the falling of large
pieces of plaster from the ceiling under the dome of the rotunda in
the Arts and Industries Building, which necessitated the expenditure
of 40 per cent of the entire appropriation provided for the mainte-
nance of the buildings.

1454—25—_4
30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

In the Natural History Building the most extensive repairs con-
sisted of painting the east and west hall attics, the watchmen’s room
on the first floor, and tin gutters of roof, and the replacing of worn-
out down spouts. The water table outside this building and the road-
ways on the south, east, and west sides of it were repaired. Meas-
urements made this year show that the movement of the keystones of
the stone arches in the rotunda has been but very slight. Observa-
tions and measurements will, however, continue to be made at inter-
vals of a few months. The most important item in the Smithsonian
Building was the repairing of a broken metal finial on top of the
tower at the northwest corner of the main building. ad

Through the courtesy of the Commissioners of the District of
Columbia and the cooperation of the fire department, the exterior
walls of the Natural History Building were thoroughly washed in
August, 1922, materially improving the appearance of the building.
In attempting to get water for this purpose, the fire department dis-
covered that all of the fire hydrants in the Smithsonian Park were
in bad condition and of an antiquated type, leaving the buildings
practically unprotected in case of fire. The District Commissioners
called the attention of the Institution to the necessity of installing
new hydrants and of adding to their number. An estimate to cover
the installation of four new fire plugs in the Smithsonian Park was
included in the estimates submitted by the Institution to the Bureau
of the Budget in September, 1922. The estimate failed to receive
favorable action, but will be again submitted for consideration. The
fire plugs in all the buildings and the fire hose are tested regularly.

As usual, the power plant was not operated during the summer,
a commercial company supplying the light and power required.
While the plant was shut down the old feed-water heater, which
had been in use ever since the plant was first put in operation, was
replaced by a new Cochran open feed-water heater and meter.
effecting a marked saving in the consumption of fuel. During the
year 8,052 tons of bituminous and 15.5 tons of stove coal were con-
sumed. Heat was supplied the buildings in the Smithsonian group,
including the Freer Building, from October 9, 1922, until May 19,
1923. The total electric current generated was 376,293 kilowatt-
hours. The electric load was greatly increased by the opening of the
Freer Building to the public, near the close of the year, so that on
dark and cloudy days it is greater than can be safely carried on
the cables leading into the Natural History Building from the lines
of the Potomac Electric Power Co. Additional cables will have to be
installed to take care of this increase. The ventilation plant in the
Freer Building was operated in the usual manner during the winter
and up to the time the building was opened to the public, since
which time the speed of the fans has been materially increased, to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 31

provide the additional air necessary for properly ventilating the
galleries. The result obtained by the system has been more satis-
factory than was anticipated. While the temperature of the gal-
leries has been somewhat high on extremely hot days, the circula-
tion of air was sufficient to produce the necessary cooling effect in
spite of the fact that no help was gained from the air washers.

The ice machine in the Natural History Building produced 279.6
tons of ice. The plant is gradually growing less efficient from year
to year. An item covering the purchase of a new ice machine
was included in the estimates for appropriations submitted to the
Bureau of the Budget.

COLLECTIONS

The total number of specimens acquired by the Museum during
the year was approximately 217,611, about 60 per cent as many as
received during the preceding year. The value of the yearly incre-
ment can not, however, be appraised from numbers only. Many of
the acquisitions this year are exceptionally valuable, either scien-
tifically, as types and as representatives of new species and new
localities, or because of great intrinsic worth. Additional material
to the extent of 1,155 lots, mainly geological, was received during the
year for special examination and report, a service of which the
practical value was demonstrated during the World War.

The distribution of duplicates, mainly to schools and colleges for
educational purposes, aggregated 9,131 specimens properly classified
and labeled and 100 pounds of material suitable for blow-pipe
analysis. These distributions were about equally divided between
the regular sets of specimens previously prepared for shipment and
those specially selected to meet particular needs. Nearly 35,000
duplicate specimens, mainly botanical and geological, were sent out
in exchange, in return for which much desirable material was re-
ceived. Over 12,000 specimens were lent to specialists for study on
behalf of the Museum and otherwise.

Anthropology.—In anthropology the more important additions
were a carved stone figure from the Makah Indians, showing a
mastery of expression by the artist; casts of the La Quina and Ober-
cassel skulls and skeleton; a noteworthy Chinese harvest bell of gilt
bronze; a superior stone collar from Porto Rico; a series of archeo-
logical specimens from Haiti; an ethnological collection from For-
mosa; an ancient stone pipe from Kentucky with remarkable incised
decorations; and casts of the busts of the heretic Pharaoh, Ameno-
phis IV and his queen, and a statuette of the latter.

Biology.—While the number of biological specimens received dur-
ing the past fiscal year falls short of that of some of the previous
years, there is no cause for alarm, as the scientific value of the col-
32 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

lections compares favorably with and probably exceeds that of the
average. .

No single collection stands out prominently, except perhaps the
Evezard collection of recent mollusks, which was purchased and
presented to the Museum by the late John B. Henderson. Another
collection of great scientific interest is the series of Opalinid ciliate
infusorians prepared by Professor Maynard M. Metcalf, of Oberlin,
Ohio, which forms the basis of his monograph published during the
year by the Museum as its Bulletin No. 120. The most significant
feature of the year’s accessions is the fact that some of the more im-
portant ones are from China, as a result of deliberate efforts at im-
proving systematically the study material from the Palearctic region
which is of such a fundamental importance for a full understanding
of our North American fauna.

This tendency toward a more conscious development of the weak
portions of our collections was made possible by the explorations
now on the way in China undertaken by friends of the Museum, such
as Mr. Charles M. Hoy’s trip financed by Dr. W. L. Abbott, and Mr.
A. de C. Sowerby’s by Col. Robert S. Clark. Rev. D. C. Graham’s
explorations in the Province of Szechuen were also fruitful of scien-
tifically valuable material, while an expedition recently sent into the
field by the National Geographic Society under the leadership of Mr.
Frederick R. Wulsin holds great promise for the future. Many im-
portant gaps in our South American collections were also filled by
Dr. Hugh M. Smith as a result of his expedition to Uruguay. Dr.
W. L. Abbott’s visit to the Dominican Republic added materially
to our botanical and herpetological series. Secretary Walcott’s ex-
plorations in the Canadian Rockies, as well as Dr. Paul Bartsch’s
trip to the West Indies, and that of Dr. Leonard Stejneger to the
Commander Islands were also productive of desirable material. The
botanical expedition to Colombia by Dr. F. W. Pennell and Mr.
Ellsworth P. Killip, undertaken in cooperation with the Phila-
delphia Academy of Natural Sciences, the New York Botanical
Garden, and the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University, brought
home one of the largest and most important plant collections ever
obtained in that country. Dr. William R. Maxon had not returned
from Central America at the end of the fiscal year.

The Australian mammal exhibit has been further strengthened by
the addition of several species, and a Malay tapir was incorporated
in the Oriental region exhibit. Several other large mammals were
likewise mounted and placed on exhibition, among which the gorilla
mounted by Brown and Aschemeier from a specimen collected by the
latter a few years ago while attached to the Collins-Garner Expe-
dition to French Congo, deserves special mention. Good progress
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 83

was made in the arrangement and cataloguing of the study series,
which are described as in excellent condition.

The research work of the staff has continued unabated and several
important manuscripts were brought to a close or nearly finished
during the year. A large number of smaller papers were published
as a result of the year’s work, but the great majority of the published
results date further back, partly due to the difficulties in obtaining
speedy publication, partly because their preparation extends over a
period of years. Some very important systematic works done by
scientists not members of the staff, but based on Museum material,
were published during the year as Bulletins No. 100, vol. 5, and
Nos. 120 and 123.

Loans of specimens to scientific institutions and individual investi-
gators have been made on the usual liberal scale. Duplicates dis-
tributed to high schools, colleges, institutions, etc., aggregated 3,545
specimens, of which 1,490 consisted of mollusks in 10 prepared sets
and 608 fishes in 8 sets. Exchanges to the number of 28,693 were
sent out, of which 2,491 were zoological and 26,202 botanical.

The total number of specimens of animals and plants now in the
national collection is estimated to exceed 7,000,000, of which 1,150,000
are plants.

Geology.—Although accessions in the department of geology are
smaller in number than in the year previous, a considerable increase
in individual specimens and in their scientific value is to be noted.

The paleontological collection of the late Orestes St. John, consist-
ing principally of fossil fishes, many of them types, adds material
of incalculable value to the specialist who may take up the study of
this group, and Dr. Frank Springer, who made this donation, has
earned the thanks of future workers in thus placing it where it will
always be available. Another most notable accession is the residu-
ary portion of the collection of the late R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa.,
presented by his heirs. This is estimated to contain not less than
10,000 specimens, mainly fossil plants, with some invertebrates and
vertebrates, from many localities in this and foreign countries, and
from various geological horizons. Supplementing the collection is
Mr. Lacoe’s paleontological library comprising, it is estimated, at
least 2,000 volumes and an equal number of pamphlets. Mrs. Coon-
ley Ward generously donated the residuary portion of the meteorite
collection of her husband, the late Prof. H. A. Ward. This is of
value not so much in adding new meteorites as in furnishing mate-
rial for study and exchange. Thirteen additional accessions of
meteorites, mostly new to the collections, are recorded, received
chiefly through exchanges.
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Continued activities of Mr. Victor C. Heikes have resulted in the
acquisition of the most interesting of the recent additions to the
economic collections.

The division of mineralogy has benefited largely through ex-
changes. A most important acquisition is a portion of a large
boulder of jade received from Col. W. B. Thompson, and an un-
usually fine specimen of crystallized descloizite from southwest
Africa, acquired through Ward’s Natural Science Establishment.
Other exchanges resulted in adding upward of 60 pieces new to
the collection. Several cut gems of unusual quality and size were
purchased through the Chamberlain endowment fund.

The continued acquisition of foreign paleontological material is
to be noted. Chief among the contributors are Dr. E. O. Ulrich,
who made collections in northern Europe; Mr. Stephen R. Capps,
in Palestine; various oil companies and private collectors in Mexico,
Central and South America; Mr. Edwin A. Walford, of Banbury,
England; and various universities and institutions in Europe.

Research work has formed an important part of the department’s
activities during the year, and assistance has been furnished to
numerous schools and students, chiefly through the distribution of
materials needed in their studies. The records show that 81 educa-
tional institutions, chiefly high schools and small colleges, have been
given such assistance.

Textiles, wood technology, organic chemistry, foods, and medi-
cine.—The collections under the supervision of the curator of tex-
tiles, which, besides textiles, embrace wood technology, foods, organic
chemistry, and medicine, were increased by many gifts and by
transfer and loan of property from other Government bureaus,
amounting to over 2,000 objects. The most important of these are
as follows:

A large series of specimens of pyralin, bakelite, condensite, and
cellulose acetate, showing the manufacture and use of these products
of modern chemical industry as substitutes for such natural raw
materials as ivory, bone, horn, tortoise shell, amber, etc., the sup-
plies of which are growing scarcer every year; and a set of pneu-
matic bicycle tires made in 1891 and believed to belong to one of
the earliest types used. There were added by gift beautiful speci-
mens of silks, woolen fabrics, and mohair upholstery textiles con-
tributed by American manufacturers to show the progress of textile
industries in this country.

To the collections arranged to show the importance of wood and
the industries based upon the use of that raw material, there were
added wonderfully well preserved specimens of the ancient cypress
wood brought to the surface during the excavation for the founda-
tion and basement of the new Walker Hotel, Washington, and be-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 85

lieved to be over 30,000 years old; an exhibit showing the manufac-
ture of double-tipped matches; and another pointing out the ravages
of the white pine blister rust and methods for its control.

The collections in the division of medicine were enlarged by a
large collection of Italian hospital supplies of the type used in the
World War ‘and carried as field equipment by the Italian troops;
specimens showing the use of chaulmoogra oil derivatives in the
treatment of leprosy in the leper settlement of Molokai, Hawaii;
several ancient surgical instruments and medical manuscripts; and
a portrait in oil of Dr. Crawford W. Long.

Mineral and Mechanical Technology.—The divisions of mineral
and mechanical technology had the experience of adding more objects
to their collections within the year than in any single year since
their inception and almost wholly as a result of their uwn efforts.
Practically every section within the divisions shared in this incre-
ment, but chiefly the sections devoted to mechanical communication,
general mechanical engineering, coal-products industries, land trans-
portation, and aerial transportation. The objects acquired for the
section of communication will now make it possible to visualize the
developments of methods of communication from those of smoke and
fire to those of wireless telegraphy, with all of the essential inter-
mediate steps. To the mechanical engineering collection there was
added a series of models made in the divisions’ workshops illustrating
mechanical principles and the fundamental elements and devices
used in machines. The subject is by no means covered by this
series, which represents simply the beginning of a new activity
possessing valuable educational possibilities. To the coal products
industries section there was added a model illustrating the manu-
facture of coal gas and carburetted water gas. With this addition *
the divisions have covered fairly completely the fuel situation both
in the home and in industry. In other sections of the divisions the
additions to the collections tend toward a rounding out of individual
subjects. Thus there were added several models of aircraft; a loco-
motive model; a boat model, and an automobile. The electrical
engineering collections were enhanced by a working model of the
Ford automobile ignition system which admirably illustrates the
principle of induction as applied to electric current generation, a
principle which Joseph Henry independently observed and an-
nounced about the same time as the accredited discoverer, Faraday.

The divisions’ cooperative educational work, particularly that with
the State of Pennsylvania, became more firmly established through
‘the preparation by Mr. S. S. Wyer, associate in mineral technology,
of the book “ The Smithsonian Institution’s Study of Natural Re-
sources Applied to Pennsylvania’s Resources.” Copies of the book
were distributed free to school teachers throughout Pennsylvania
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

designated by the board of education and used in certain fitting
courses of the grade schools. One of the interesting reactions re-
sulting from this work was the assistance rendered by Mr. Wyer to
the city of Erie, Pa., in an intensive educational campaign organized
by the local chamber of commerce in an endeavor to conserve the
city’s natural gas supply, which is rapidly declining, due largely to
preventable wastage.

Graphic Arts—The 1,146 specimens assigned to this division
covered a wide range, materially exceeded in number those received
the preceding year, and brought the total number of specimens in
the division up to 22,936. Almost the beginning and the latest de-
velopment of type composition were represented in the year’s acces-
sions by a leaf of the Gutenberg Bible, one of the first books to be
printed from movable type, and examples of the monotype system
of composing and casting justified lines of single type. Other im-
portant acquisitions included a newspaper exhibit; specimens of
bookbinding; a unitype typesetting machine, wood-block prints and
etchings by Helen Hyde; 50 proofs of etchings, aquatints, wood-
block prints, lithographs, etc., the gift of 24 contemporary artists;
Woodville Latham’s motion picture projector of 1895; notable addi-
tions of pictorial photographic prints and color collections in pho-
tography; and many additions supplementing and completing ex-
isting exhibits.

Seven loan exhibits, five in the graphic arts halls and two in the
gallery devoted to the photographic section, brought the Museum
collections in these lines prominently before the local and visting
public. Two collections of pictorial photographs were lent for exhi-
bition elsewhere and, in furthering publicity outside of Washington,
*two traveling exhibits of about 100 specimens each were prepared
illustrating the principal processes of the graphic arts. The first of
these was shown in seven different cities and the second, prepared
later in the year, was exhibited only in one city.

History.—During the past fiscal year the historical collections re-
ceived, in addition to the normal increase along this line, two acces-
sions of unusual size and importance and one of unparalleled in-
trinsic and scientific value. The first of these includes the large
ageregation of antiquarian, costume, military, naval, and miscella-
neous materials collected by Mrs. Julian James during a long period
for deposit in the National Museum, which by the terms of her will
have now become the permanent property of the Institution. This
collection has already been described in previous reports, but its
permanent acquirement by the Museum is worthy of special note.
The second accession of unusual significance is a large collection of
historical military materials deposited in the Museum by the Mili-
tary Service Institution. The collection was assembled by this
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY ov

society beginning at the time of its organization in 1878, and con-
sists for the most part of swords, guns, pistols, flags, and miscella-
neous relics of the period of the Civil War, but includes also relics of
the former wars in which the United States has participated.
Among the most notable objects in the collection are a bronze can-
non captured from the British troops commanded by Maj. Gen.
John Burgoyne at Saratoga in 1777; a mortar made by D. King of
Philadelphia; a sword owned by Commodore Stephen Decatur,
United States Navy, and the mounted figure of the war horse of
Gen. Philip H. Sheridan.

The accession of unparalleled importance is one including the en-
tire collection ‘of numismatic material formerly exhibited in the
United States Mint in Philadelphia, which, owing to the closing of
this mint to the public, was transferred to the Museum by the Treas-
ury Department in June, 1923. This collection includes a large num-
ber of ancient coins, a fair representation of medieval European
coins, a very complete aggregation of modern European coins and
commemorative medals, a large collection of the temporary coins of
the period of the World War, and an exceptionally fine and large
collection of United States coins, medals, and paper currency. While
the acquirement of this collection by the Museum is most gratifying
in that it adds such an aggregation of intrinsically valuable matter
to the Museum collection, the most essential fact in connection with
the transaction is the basis which it offers for the future develop-
ment of the collection and the encouragement of the science of numis-
matics in the United States.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

It is hoped that the falling off in biological exploration noted in
recent reports has reached its lowest ebb during the present year,
and that from now ou a turn of the tide may be expected. With
this possibility in view plans and problems for future biological
explorations and expeditions have been outlined, preparing the
Museum to take the greatest possible advantage of the hoped-for
improved conditions. The central idea proceeds from the fact that
the early biological problems and research of the Museum naturally
related to the fauna and flora of North America, especially that part
opened up by the War with Mexico and the explorations for rail-
road lines to the Pacific coast. The necessity of working up this
‘material was naturally paramount. With the purchase of Alaska a
hitherto unexplored territory on this continent naturally attracted
the attention of the National Museum, especially since the early ac-
tivities in Alaska were almost exclusively investigated by the Federal
Government with the result that nearly all the material collected
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

there came to Washington. So intensive was this study of the
native fauna, especially that of the vertebrates, that within a com-
paratively short time North America, from a taxonomic point of
view, was better explored and better known than any other part of
the world, Europe itself not excepted. At the time these intensive
studies began North America was regarded as one of the primary
zoogeographical divisions of the world, coequal with South America,
the oriental region, Africa, and the Europe-North Asian region, also
known as the palearctic region. Later on considerable collections
from the Pacific coasts of northern Asia and from Europe found
their way into the National Museum. It was then seen that the
North American fauna, at least that part which occupied the more
temperate portions of the continent northward, is most closely re-
lated to the palearctic fauna of temperate Asia and northward, and
it was realized that the dominant constituency of the North Ameri-
can fauna actually had its origin in the Old World. Here then is a
whole series of closely related problems seeking solution in Asia and
Europe. The circumstance that the United States Biological Sur-
vey has gradually taken over to a great extent the restricted North
American field for still more refined cultivation serves to stimulate
the interest of certain of the larger divisions of the National
Museum in the palearctic region. The Museum has already made a
good start in that direction. It has excellent collections in many
lines of the palearctic fauna. Its collection of European mammals
is one of the most comprehensive extent. It has excellent series of
birds, reptiles, and batrachians from Japan, Korea, and Kamchatka
in eastern Asia, besides a respectable representation in other classes.
It has also important material collected by the Lyman-Hollister
expedition to the Altai region some years ago, and the Koren-Avery
expedition to the mouth of the Kolyma.

It is, therefore, with special gratification that attention is called to
the work now in preparation and partly in progress for the biological
exploration of China in the interest of the National Museum. The
field work by Arthur de C. Sowerby, the expense of which is most
generously met by Robert S. Clark, which was started in the fall
of 1921, has continued during the present fiscal year, and very ma-
terial additions to our vertebrate collections have already resulted.

Of equal significance is the fact that Dr. W. L. Abbott, after the
return of Mr. Charles M. Hoy from Australia, decided to send him
to China to collect for the Museum. Mr. Hoy departed for his.
new field on December 15, 1922. Thus far no collections have been
received, due to difficulties of transportation and the political situa-
tion which has placed obstacles in the way of reaching the final
destination, but recent letters indicate that we may soon see tangible
results of his efforts.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 39

A third expedition in China, from which the National Museum is
expected to derive great benefit, is that of the National Geographic
Society, under the leadership of Mr. Frederick R. Wulsin who ‘is
already in the field.

In this connection should be mentioned the activities of Rev. D. C.
Graham, who, located at Suifu in the Province of Szechuen, China,
undertook an expedition to Mount Omei, from which the Museum
received very important collections, especially insects, birds, and rep-
tiles. He is planning to make an expedition to Tatsienlu, and pos-
sibly to Mupin, during the present summer, both localities of great
zoological interest.

Dr. W. L. Abbott revisited the Dominican Republic in February
and March, 1923, continuing his biological explorations of, recent
years. As his permit to collect birds was delayed until he was about
to leave the country he only obtained the skin of one bird and saved
its body in alcohol. His. collections of reptiles and amphibians,
however, were highly important, obtaining as he did a new species
of frog, recently described by Miss Cochran as Leptodactylus abbotti
from the specimen collected by him. It is nearly related to the one
from Porto Rico and establishes the genus as one definitely belong-
ing to the Antillean fauna. He also collected about 600 plants in
the southern part of the Samana Peninsula, which will doubtless
prove as interesting as the previous collections obtained in the same
region by Doctor Abbott, which have yielded a large number of new
species.

In connection with the heredity experiments conducted by Dr.
Paul Bartsch, under the joint auspices of the Smithsonian and Carne-
gie Institutions, it was found desirable to add several species of
Cerions in order to exhaust the apparent possibilities that this group
presents. For that reason Doctor Bartsch visited Porto Rico in
May, obtaining a large number of specimens of the desired Cerion,
as well as a large series of additional species. About 15,000 speci-
mens were added to the Museum collection as the result of the trip.

Dr. Hugh M. Smith, associate curator in zoology, spent several
months in South America, primarily for the study of the fur-seal
and other fisheries of Uruguay, during which time he made extensive
collections for the Museum in all branches, especially fishes, reptiles,
and marine invertebrates. He sailed from New York on September
23, 1922, returning in January, 1928. The opportunity to collect
in Brazil when the steamer stopped was improved, but the main
collections were made in Uruguay, especially at the Lobos Islands.
The collections form a most welcome addition to the Museum series,
which were very deficient in material from the region visited.

During the spring of 1923 Mr. C. R. Aschemeier, one of the taxi-
dermists, was given permission to accompany Mr. A. H. Fisher on an
expedition to the lower Amazon River, Brazil, the understanding

being that Mr. Aschemeier should devote his time to making collec-
tions of the vertebrates for the National Museum, with particular
reference to river dolphins and seacows. He left New York late in
April and no collections have been received as yet.

Dr. William M. Mann, assistant custodian, section of Hymenoptera,
undertook for the Department of Agriculture a trip to Mexico be-
tween January 19 and June 7, 1923, at the purpose of collecting and
studying certain fruit flies. the far as possible general collections of
insects were made and some reptiles and a few ethnological speci-
mens secured. The material has not as yet been accessioned, but
enough is known of it to prove its value, although owing to the
_extreme dryness of the season collecting was very poor. From
Nogales he went down the west coast of Mexico as far as Tepic,
making a 10-day side trip to Lower California in the district between
Loreto and Comondu. Afterwards the States of Jalisco and Colima
were visited and then a rather hurried trip was made to the Isthmus
of Tehuantepec and in Chiapas as far as Tapachula. He returned
by way of Loredo, Tex.

Secretary Charles D. Walcott’s expedition to the Canadian Rockies
was productive of valuable additions to the mammal collection, as
already mentioned. ,

The botanical explorations during the year have added materially
to the collections of the National Herbarium. Dr. W: L. Abbott’s
visit to the Dominican Republic has already been mentioned.

Mrs. Agnes Chase visited Europe from March until July, 1922, for
the purpose of studying the grass collections in the herbaria at
Vienna, Munich, Florence, Pisa, Geneva, Berlin, Leiden, Brussels,
Paris, and London, and many type specimens of American grasses
were examined. A large number of valuable specimens of grasses
also was obtained for deposit in the National Herbarium, including
fragments of many types and duplicates of early South American
collections.

Dr. William R. Maxon, associate curator of the division of plants,
left Washington in May, 1928, accompanying a party directed by
Mr. O. F. Cook, of the United States Department of Agriculture,
whose purpose is to investigate the rubber resources of Central
America. At the time of preparation of this report the party was
in Panama and it was expected that two months additional would
be spent in Central America.

Dr. A. 8. Hitchcock, custodian of the grass herbarium, left Wash-
ington in May, 1923, with the expectation of spending six months in
Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru, where he intends to devote particular
attention to the study of grasses, but will also make collections of
other groups of plants. The expedition is supported jointly by the
United States Department of Agriculture, New York Botanical
Garden, and Gray Herbarium.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 41

Dr. Charles E. Resser, under the auspices of the United States
Geological Survey, accompanied Dr. E. O. Ulrich in an investiga-
tion of the Cambrian and Ordovician rocks of the Valley of Vir-
ginia during May, 1923, and secured important stratigraphic col-
lections. Dr. Ulrich with his assistant, Mr. R. D. Mesler, continued
field researches during the month of June, studying various sections
of the Appalachian Valley in eastern Tennessee. During his trip
to the International Geological Congress at Brussels in the summer
of 1922, Doctor Ulrich visited important Paleozoic localities in va-
rious European countries and presented to the Museum all of the
material collected.

While traveling in Europe in the summer of 1922, Miss Jessie G.
Beach was detailed to study collections in various museums, and to
consult with European scientists regarding matters of interest to the
Museum. Miss Beach visited museums in France, Italy, Germany,
Belgium, England, and Scotland, listing and sketching various type
specimens of unusual interest, and studying methods of installation
and labeling.

Mr. C. W. Gilmore, under the auspices of the Museum, made a
trip to Roy, N. Mex., to investigate a reported discovery of elephas
remains. The specimen proved to be valueless for museum purposes,
and from that standpoint the trip was a failure. Mr. N. H. Boss
made several short collecting trips to the Miocene deposits along
Chesapeake Bay in search of fossil remains. As in previous years
these trips were productive in the recovery of well-preserved ceta-
cean remains.

Late in the fiscal year Mr. Gilmore and Mr. Boss were detailed to
excavate remains of dinosaurs in the Dinosaur National Monument,
Utah, an undertaking which has long been awaiting a favorable op-
portunity for its consummation.

Assistant curators Foshag and Shannon on their own initiative
made a brief trip to old copper mines in Carroll County, Md., a
district which despite its proximity to Washington was practically
unrepresented in the collections. A large suite of copper and iron
ores and associations was secured. A day was likewise spent at the
diabase quarry near Belmont Park, Va. So much material of interest
was found that Mr. Shannon conducted the Washington Mineralogi-
cal Society over the ground on their annual field trip. The speci-
mens collected have been turned over to the Museum. The limestone
quarry at Leesburg, Va., was also visited and interesting mineralogi-
cal material secured.

Investigations by Miss Frances Densmore among the Yuma In-
dians of Arizona and some tribes in northern Mexico for the Bureau
42 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

of American Ethnology brought to the Museum a collection of
desirable ethnologica.

The third year of the exploration of ancient Pueblo Bonito, to
which the National Geographic Society has devoted $75,000, under
Neil M. Judd, the curator of American archeology, was productive
of a number of specimens now deposited in the Museum. The jour-
neys of Dr. Ale’ Hrdlicka to Brazil and Europe resulted in enriching
the collections of the division of physical anthropology. In June
Mr. Matthew W. Stirling, of the division of ethnology, carried on an
exploration of several ancient villages at Mobridge, S. Dak., and
collected a valuable series of material for the Museum.

For several other important expeditions in which the Museum was
interested see under Researches and Explorations in the report of the
secretary, page 6.

MEETINGS, CONGRESSES, AND RECEPTIONS

The auditorium and adjacent council rooms afforded accommoda-
tions during the year for 145 meetings, covering a wide range of
subjects. An innovation this year was a series of free Sunday after-
noon lectures arranged by the Woman’s Welfare Association. Here-
tofore the auditorium has not been used on that day.

The governmental agencies taking advantage of the meeting
accommodations, besides, of course, the Smithsonian Institution and
its branches, included the Budget Bureau and the Public Health
Service of the Treasury Department; the War Department and its
Army Medical School; the Women’s Bureau of the Department of
Labor; the Bureau of Entomology, the Forest Service, and the
Federal Horticultural Board of the Department of Agriculture.
The scientific and other groups included the National Academy of
Sciences, the National Association of Postmasters of the United
States, the National Committee on Prisons and Prison Labor, the
National Association of Travelers Aid Societies, the National Con-
ference of Social Work, the National Consumers’ League, National
Amateur Athletic Federation of America, the National Medical
Association, the National Baird Memorial Committee, the Garden
Club of America, the Girl Scouts, World’s Dairy Congress Associa-
tion, the American Association of Museums, Women’s Welfare Asso-
ciation, the American Horticultural Society, the Anthropological
Society of Washington, the Archaeological Society of Washington,
the Art and Archaeological League of Washington, the Audubon
Society of the District of Columbia, the Washington (D. C.) Chap-
ter of the Wild Flower Preservation Society of America, the Ento-
mological Society of Washington, the Federal Photographic Society,
the Shakespeare Society of Washington, the School of Foreign Serv-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 43

Ice of Georgetown University, the American University, Howard
University, the Garden Club of Washington, the Southern Society
of Washington, and the Reserve Officers’ Association of the District
of Columbia.

At the Twentieth International Congress of Americanists at Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil, August 20 to September 3, 1922, the Institution
was represented by Dr. Walter Hough, head curator of anthropology
in the Museum, and Dr. Ales Hrdlicka, curator of physical anthro-
pology in the Museum, who served also as delegates on the part of
the United States Government. Another member of the Museum
staff, Dr. E. O. Ulrich, associate in paleontology, represented the
Institution at the Thirteenth International Geological Congress meet-
ing in Brussels, Belgium, August 10 to 19,1922. The Museum was also
represented at the eighteenth annual meeting of the American Asso-
ciation of Museums, held in Charleston, S. C., April 4 to 7, Mr.
F. L. Lewton and the writer serving as delegates.

The Museum was the scene of several receptions. On the evening
of December 19 the halls of the Museum assigned to the National
Gallery of Art were opened for a reception following a lecture in the
auditorium under the auspices of the Anthropological Society of
Washington and the Archaeological Society of Washington. Oppor-
tunity was thus afforded for inspecting the collection of Chihuahua
pottery belonging to the latter society. On January 9 the Archaeo-
logical Society and the Art and Archaeological League of Washing-
ton held a reception in the National Gallery of Art following an
evening lecture by Count Byron Kuhn de Prorok, with a first view
of a rare collection of antique jewelry recently lent to the society by
one of its members, Mr. Kurt Walter Bachstitz, of The Hague.
Another large reception was that to the National Academy of
Sciences on the evening of April 23, in honor of Dr. W. W. Camp-
bell. This followed a lecture in the auditorium by Doctor Campbell.

The exhibition halls on the first floor of the Natural History
Building were the setting for a conversazione on the evening of
February 3, as a part of the program in celebration of the centenary
of the birth of Spencer Fullerton Baird, the second secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution. The Marine Band furnished music during
the evening. A meeting of Girl Scout leaders in the auditorium on
the evening of April 25 was the occasion for opening all the exhibi-
tion halls in the building from 6.30 to 11 p. m. to enable the Girl
Scouts, their leaders, parents, and friends to view the collections.

MISCELLANEOUS

The number of visitors to the Natural History Building during
the year aggregated 508,518; to the Arts and Industries Building,
259,542: to the Smithsonian Building, 95,168; and to the Aircraft
44 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Building, 42,904. The national collections in the Natural History
Building are accessible to the public every day in the year, Sundays
as well as week days. Owing, however, to the limited appropriations
for the maintenance of the Museum, the other buildings are not epen
on Sundays.

The Museum published during the year 10 volumes and 42 separate
papers. The former comprised the Annual Report of the Museum
for 1922; volumes 60 and 61 of the Proceedings; Bulletin 100, volume
5; Bulletins 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, and 126. The separates included
1 bulletin article; 4 papers in the series, Contributions from the
United States National Herbarium; 5 papers from volume 61, 21
papers from volume 62, and 11 papers from volume 63 of the Pro-
ceedings. The distribution of volumes and separates to libraries
and individuals on the regular mailing list aggregated 63,869 copies
besides 8,660 copies supplied in response to special applications.

The Museum library, as one of the libraries administered under the
direction of the Smithsonian Institution, enjoys the close coopera-
tion of its associated libraries and in turn contributes substantially
toward the general library activities. Much has been accomplished
during the year toward better library service. The long-needed
subject catalogue has been started, and at the close of the year 4,400
cards had been made and arranged. The arrangement of cards from
the Concilium Bibliographicum distributed since the World War is
well under way, and progress is being made in the reclassification
and shelving of the technological collections. Work has, however,
suffered from a lack of funds for binding and renovating and from
a vacancy in the staff during eight months of the year. The receipts
for the year numbered 1,489 volumes and 2,796 pamphlets, bringing
up the total of books and other material in the library to 160,560
titles. The number of loans made was 9,220, of which 5,191 were to
the sectional libraries.

The death of John B. Henderson, a Regent of the Smithsonian
Institution, on January 4, 1923, deprived the Museum of a valued
friend, a constant contributor and an indefatigable worker on its
collections. The members of the scientific staff and other employees
of the Museum and Institution gathered in the auditorium on Janu-
ary 8, 1923, to pay respect to their colleague and adopted resolu-
tions expressing their deep sense of loss. Doctor Walcott presided
and brief addresses were made by Doctor Walcott, Dr. W. H. Dall,
Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, and Dr. Paul Bartsch.

Respectfully submitted.

Administrative Assistant to the Secretary in charge,

AEE NLA. 2
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith the report on the activi-
ties of the National Gallery of Art for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1923.

The third year of the existence of the National Gallery as a sep-
arate administrative unit of the Smithsonian Institution has wit-
nessed substantial advance in a number of directions, although addi-
tions to the art collections have fallen below those of several pre-
vious years. The activities of the gallery continued in most respects
in directions corresponding with those of the two preceding years,
the energies of the limited staff being devoted largely to the receipt,
installation, and care of the collections; to completing the records
and labeling; and to the preparation and publication of matter
intended to aid in awakening an interest in the welfare of the
gallery, and more especially in making known the vital importance
of a gallery building.

An illustrated lecture prepared by the director, with the purpose
of making the gallery and its needs better known to the public, has
been widely presented. One copy with 75 lantern views, illustrating
the gallery’s collections, is in the hands of Mrs. J. W. Summers, of
Walla Walla, Wash., who has associated with her Mrs. Henry
Osterman, and has been utilized largely under the auspices of the
Federation of Women’s Clubs, principally in the State of Wash-
ington. A second copy (with seven additional slides), intrusted to
Miss Leila Mechlin, secretary of the American Federation of Arts,
and utilized under the auspices of that important organization, is
being very generally presented in the smaller cities and towns of the
United States; and a third copy (with 83 slides), placed in the
hands of Mrs. Rose V. S. Berry, chairman of the fine arts depart-
ment of the Federation of Woman’s Clubs, is being featured at the
meetings of that club throughout the country.

A recent act of Congress authorizes the raising of funds for the
erection of a national gallery building in the following language:
“'The Regents of the Smithsonian Institution are authorized to pre-
pare preliminary plans for a suitable fireproof building with granite
fronts for the National Gallery of Art, including the National Por-
trait Gallery and the history collections of the United States National

45
46 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Museum, said building to be erected when funds from gifts or
bequests are in the possession of the said Regents, in sections or com-
pletely on the north side of the Mall between the Natural History
Building, United States National Museum, and Seventh Street, leav-
ing a space between it and the latter of not less than one hundred
feet and a space of not less than one hundred feet between it and
Seventh Street, with its south front on a line with the south front
of the said Natural History Building.

A two-page leaflet on the national gallery has been issued, which,
like the recent leaflets on the Smithsonian Institution, is to have
a wide distribution. It is intended to bring forcibly to the atten-
tion of the public the great need for a separate building to house
the national art collections.

Detailed information regarding the growth of the gallery within
the institution and as a feature of the United States National
Museum may be found in Bulletin 70 of the National Museum, and
its subsequent activities are recorded in the annual reports of the
institution and Musuem and in the annual reports of the gallery for
the years 1921 and 1922.

In two articles prepared by the director and published in art
journals during the year attention is called to the growth of the
national gallery and to the great need for a gallery building. The
first, under the title “The Story of the National Gallery of Art,”
appeared in Art and Archeology for June, 1923. The story of the
National Gallery of Art from its beginning nearly a century ago
is the record of the prolonged struggle of the art idea for national
recognition for a place in the serious consideration of the American
people, and it is to be regetted that to-day, although art institu-
tions are springing up on all hands, art has slight national recogni-
tion beyond the attention necessary to the care and display of the
art treasures acquired by gift and bequest. For nearly a century
the Smithsonian Institution has harbored the dream of a gallery of
art, but art has been in the shadow of diversified scientific activities
and in the deeper shadow of the all-absorbing material interests of
a rapidly developing Nation. To-day the conditions are far from
satisfactory. Growth of the collections through gratuitous contri-
butions, even, is embarrassed by the almost complete exhaustion of
space for the reception and display of all save accessions of very
limited extent, and the problem before the institution, and certainly
with equal insistence before the American people, is “ Shall America
have a National Gallery of Art, or a National Museum of Art, that
will give us a respectable place among the cultured nations of the
world?” The story of the vicissitudes of the incipient, struggling
national gallery is here presented with the view of making known a
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 47

great national shortcoming and stirring the pride of a people not
accustomed to take a second or a third place in any field worthy of
their ambition.

The second, with the title “Shall America Have a National
Gallery of Art?” was published in The American Magazine of
Art for July, 1923. This article is a plea for recognition of the
claims of the incipient national gallery upon the American people
and seeks to determine and enlist the agencies that may be brought
to bear upon the erection of a gallery building.

The great importance of prompt action becomes apparent when
it is recalled that the failure to provide housing for possible ad-
ditions to the national collections means a great annual loss to the
national gallery—to the Nation. The yearly addition of art works
between 1905 and 1920, the latter the date of the complete ex-
haustion of gallery space in Museum buildings, averaged upward
of half a million a year, while the entire increase per year for the
three years since the latter date has fallen below $40,000. The loss
to the gallery and to the Nation at this rate, would, in a score of
years, amount to a sum equal to the erection of a building worthy
of the name, and there can be little doubt that if a gallery building
worthy of the name awaited the inflow of gifts and bequests,
accessions would reach the substantial figure of half a million per
year, as heretofore, or who shall say not twice that figure? Private
owners, seeking a final resting place for their treasures, would
doubtless, in many cases, prefer to be represented in a gallery be-
longing to the Nation, to all the people alike, than in any other.
Our plea, then, the plea of the Smithsonian Institution, is not only
a worthy but an urgent one, and is now made to all the people of
the Nation, and for all the people of the Nation.

THE GALLERY COMMISSION

In 1921, the Regents of the Institution organized a commission
which should devote its attention to the promotion of the gallery’s
interests in various directions, and the second annual meeting of
this commission was held in the Regents’ room of the Institution
on December 12, 1922. The members present were: Daniel Chester
French, chairman; W. K. Bixby; William H. Holmes, secretary
ex Officio; Gari Melchers; Charles Moore; James Parmelee; Edward
W. Redfield; Charles D. Walcott, ex officio. At this meeting numer-
ous important problems were considered and steps were taken to
enlist national interest in the gallery and its development as an in-
dispensable national institution.

The report of the secretary of*the commission for the year was
followed by reports of the standing, special, and subcommittees,
48 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Attention was given to the previously much-discussed project of an
important exhibition of portraits, official and lay, to be held in the
gallery, but satisfactory arrangements for holding the exhibit in
1923 could not be made. The question of appealing to Congress
for a building for art and history was considered and discussion
took place as to the feasibility of having the building project in-
cluded in the program being formulated by Congress for prospective
public buildings. Secretary Walcott brought to the attention of the
commission the question of the advisability of an appeal to American
institutions and to the American people for aid in the building
project. Following a discussion of the Ranger bequest fund and its
administration, the commission appointed a committee of three—
Messrs. E. W. Redfield, Gari Melchers, W. H. Holmes—to look after
the gallery’s interests in the final disposition of the purchases made
from this fund by the National Academy of Design.

With this meeting, the inital one year terms of three members of
the commission—Herbert Adams, Gari Melchers, Charles Moore—
expired, and the Board of Regents at its annual meeting, December
14, 1922, elected these persons to succeed themselves for the full term
of four years.

The art advisory committee appointed at the last meeting of the
Board of Regents, examined the several paintings and other works
offered to the gallery as permanent accessions. The following were
accepted :

“ Signing of the Treaty of Ghent,” an oil painting by Sir A. Forestier, 1914.
Presented by the Sulgrave Institution.

A cameo-cutter’s outfit, consisting of wheel, dies, tools, etc., which formerly

belonged to and was used by Louis Bonet, an engraver on fine stone. Pre-
sented by Paul W. Bartlett.

THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT COLLECTION

As announced in the report for last year, a number of influential
citizens, desiring to preserve some pictorial record of the World War,
organized a National Art Committee immediately after the close of
the war, and arranged with a number of our leading artists to
paint portraits of certain distinguished leaders of America and other
allied nations in the war with Germany. The members of the com-
mittee as organized are: Hon. Henry White (chairman) ; Herbert
L. Pratt (secretary and treasurer) ; Mrs. W. H. Crocker, Robert W.
de Forest, Abram Garfield, Mrs. E. H. Harriman, Arthur W.
Meeker, J. Pierpont Morgan, Charles P. Taft, Charles D. Walcott,
and Henry C. Frick (since deceased).

Under this arrangement, 21 portraits were painted and assembled
in the national walter y during the “month of May, 1921. Later these
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 49

were turned over to the American Federation of Arts for purposes
of public exhibition. Before their final return to their place in the
national portrait gallery, they were exhibited as follows:

That the gift of these portraits might be distinctly national in
character, it was decided that a group of two or more, financed by
the art patrons of any city, should be inscribed as presented to the
Nation by that city and that a representative of that city should be-
come an honorary member of the National Art Committee. It was
further decided that a tablet or other permanent record in the gallery
should bear the names of the National Art Committee, including the
chairmen of all local committees, and that there should be a record
of the name of each subscriber to the purchase fund.

The cities which, to date, have made presentations are as follows:

The collection of 21 portraits was returned to the gallery by the
American Federation of Arts on June 12, 1923, and was hung in the
central hall of the ground floor in direct connection with the great
body of exhibits pertaining to the war with Germany. On its return
to Washington the collection was enriched by the three-quarter
length portrait of Her Majesty Elizabeth, Queen of the Belgians, by
Jean McLean (Mrs. John C. Johnaaenhs the completion of which
had been delayed.

form of the catalogues of the art collections of the National Museum pre-
pared by former Assistant Secretary Rathbun (Bull. 70, U. S. N. M., 1916),
which was published, however, before the gallery became a separate de-
partment of the Institution. It contains an introduction by the director,
giving a brief account of the development of the art interests of the Institu-
tion and an outline of the organization of the gallery. This is followed by a
list of the art works acquired previous to November, 1921, with brief biog-
raphies of the artists. It is illustrated with a ground plan and full page
halftone plates of 25 of the most noteworthy of paintings and sculptures in
the gallery.

APPENDIX 3
REPORT ON THE FREER GALLERY OF ART

Sir: I have the honor to submit the third annual report on the
Freer Gallery of Art for the year ending June 30, 1923.

THE COLLECTION

Work completed during the year includes the examination, classi-
fication, and preliminary cataloguing of Chinese and Japanese stone
sculptures and jades begun in 1922. New work undertaken includes
the preliminary cataloguing and final. storage of Chinese and Japa-
nese bronzes, lacquers and wood sculptures, Near Eastern and
Egyptian pottery, and miscellaneous objects of bone, ivory, metal,
glass, etc., from various sources. Much additional work has been
done on the preservation of oil paintings, and one Chinese kakemono
has been remounted in panel form. The autumn, winter, and early
spring were largely devoted to the installation of exhibits and to
other preparations for the opening of the gallery to the public on
May 2, involving the construction of cases according to designs pre-
viously made, the designing of pedestals, special stands, mounts.
and easels and the execution of these under direct supervision of the
curator and the superintendent, the choice, exhibition, and labeling
of objects, the transfer of books to shelves provided for them in the
east study room, and the preparation of a brief pamphlet setting
forth the history of the Freer collection, together with necessary in-
formation regarding the purpose and use of the building and col-
lection. This pamphlet was given to visitors during the opening
week and has since been sold for 5 cents a copy, having reached a
second printing of 3,000 copies. In June the making of identifica-
tion photographs for the catalogue cards was begun.

BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT

Work accomplished during the year includes the completion of
several undertakings mentioned in the second annual report, such
as finishing gallery walls and floors, picture frames and screen boxes,
as well as many new tasks completed or begun and the inevitable re-

59
~

60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

pairs due to normal settling of the building and to ordinary wear
and tear. For the exhibition galleries, the workshop has turned out
52 cases, and has 12 others “in work” ; also 9 easels, 22 pedestals, 15
special stands, 40 block plinths, 5 large frames for screens, stone
sculptures and tiles, 100 reeded frames for etchings, 3 molded com-
position bases for stone sculptures, and 5 sets of barricade stands
have been made; while 6 walnut panels for the exhibition of scrolls
and 19 benches were contracted for and built outside. On the ground
floor, the east study room has been furnished with cork flooring,
bookcases, and a desk, the latter made in the workshop. The offices,
storage rooms, workrooms, and lavatories have received additional
equipment, including desk lights with necessary floor outlets, metal
shelving, cupboards, a set of portable shelves for photographic work,
glass door panels, extra locks, electric fans, etc. The fan room floor
has been painted, and in the attic blue size has been applied to the
skylights and cotton curtains have been hung above the ceiling lights
for the purpose of modifying both light and heat. In the cellar
two columns have been constructed under the partition wall between
two rooms in the northwest corner of the building. To the equip-
ment of the court fresh soil and a few trees have been added, as
well as three peafowl from the National Zoological Park and a
supply of goldfish from the Fish Commission. Indebtedness to these
two organizations is gratefully acknowledged.

OPENING AND ATTENDANCE

The formal opening of the gallery took place during the week of
May 2 to 8, inclusive. It was preceded by a “press view” on the
morning of May 1, and a private view for the Establishment and
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution on the afternoon of the same
day. For the opening week 3,300 invitations were issued.

Total attendance for May, 19,274.

Largest attendance on Sundays, averaging 1,022.

Smallest attendance on Mondays, averaging 406.

Total attendance for June, 13,474.

Largest attendance during the week of the Shriners’ convention,
1,158 and 1,202 on June 6 and 7, respectively, with an average attend-
ance of 548 on other days. Barns the rest of the month the largest
attendance was on Sundays, with an average of 490, and the smallest
on Mondays, with an average of 211.

Attendance in the study rooms for May and June, 186 persons, of
whom 4 brought in objects for examination and 11 received permis-
sion to copy.

Total attendance for May and June, 32, 648.

After June 11 a new regulation went into effect, namely, that the
building should be open from 9 until 4.30 every day of the week
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 61

except Monday, when it should be closed all day. This serves a
double purpose in that it not only makes the exhibitions available to
many people who are unable to come on week days, but also gives
opportunities for necessary work which can not be so well undertaken
when the building is open to visitors.

FIELD WORK
IN EUROPE

The months of July and August were spent by Miss Guest in
Europe and were devoted to a study of various collections of Oriental
art, following her attendance as delegate from this gallery to the
meetings of the Société Asiatique de Paris, held in Paris from July
10 to 18, in celebration of the centenary of Champollion. somone the
most important groups of objects studied were:

The collections of the Mission Pelliot, exhibited in the Musée
Guimet and the Musée du Louvre.

The partly dismantled but important loan exhibition of Oriental
pottery and stone sculpture at the Musée Cernuschi.

The collections of M. Raymond Koechlin and M. Calmann.

The Central Asian paintings collected by Sir Aurel Stein and de-
posited in the British Museum.

The objects from Turfan collected by Professor Von le Coq and
now stored in the Vélkerkunde Museum, and those from Samarra
collected by Dr. Friedrich Sarre and now exhibited in the Kaiser
Friedrich Museum, Berlin.

Miss Guest spent several days also in the pottery works of Staf-
fordshire, England, where she was given every facility for examining
materials and processes of manufacture.

Miss Guest’s more detailed account of her field activities accom-
panies this report as Appendix A (not printed).

IN CHINA

On February 12, Mr. Bishop left here for China, in charge of an
archeological expedition sent out under the joint auspices of the
Freer Gallery of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Work-
ing in accordance with instructions, but of necessity largely at his -
own discretion, Mr. Bishop’s chief concern so far has been with mat-
ters of organization, which he has managed and now settled more
successfully than might reasonably have been expected. He has also
visited several sites of great archeological interest and made observa-
tions of importance to the future work of the expedition.

Mr. Bishop’s detailed account of his field activities accompanies
this report as Appendix B (not printed).

APPENDIX 4
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sir: In response to your request I have the honor to submit the
following report on the field researches, office work, and other opera-
tions of the Bureau of American Ethnology during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1923, conducted in accordance with the act of Con-
gress approved June 12, 1923. The act referred to contains the fol-
lowing item:

American ethnology: For continuing ethnological researches among the
American Indians and the natives of Hawaii, including the excavation and
preservation of archeologic remains, under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution, including the necessary employees and the purchase of necessary
books and periodicals, $44,000.

The chief has endeavored to expend the sum of money allotted
in as conservative and economical a manner as possible, although
confronted with many difficulties, among which is the increased cost
of field work. Since the bureau was first organized expenses for its
maintenance have greatly increased, and have doubled within the
last 10 years. Several other tendencies of the times have limited
the production of results. There has been a great awakening of
interest in the treatment of certain Indian tribes by Government
officials which has led to a corresponding increase in requests for our
publications. Never before was there a greater demand for the
published reports and bulletins of the bureau. The epoch-making
discoveries in the Valley of the Tombs in Egypt have very greatly
increased interest in the Science of Man and the desire for more
accurate knowledge of prehistoric man in American is very keen.
Newspapers, magazines, and: other periodicals have done much to
increase this interest and, as may be said with regret, many fake dis-
coveries have been foisted on the public. Never before have accurate
accounts of Indian life like those published by the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology been more in demand than at the present time.

Several wealthy institutions have been led to give more money to
American anthropology. Plans for archeological work in Yucatan
and Central America costing many thousands of dollars a year are
mentioned in some quarters, and many thousands are annually ex-
pended by another institution on pueblo archeology. For lack of
adequate funds, the bureau is unable to carry on extensive work of
this magnitude and it remains for the bureau to continue its work

63
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

along the lines already successfully followed—by researches and pub-
lication of the results of less ambitious plans. It can not be expected
that the quantity of field work with this handicap can be as great
as it was when the field was almost untilled, but the chief is striving
to keep the quality up to the past. For years to come as the culture
of our aborigines fades into the past there will be plenty of work to
do in gathering survivals and publishing reports to meet increased
demand for authoritative literature on our aborigines. As the work
of the bureau calls for increased popularization, in the judgment
of the chief, the bureau should enlarge the number of popular
articles which it publishes from time to time without decreasing
strictly technical discoveries. The pages of our reports are full of
the records of discoveries which are little known and at present
interest only a few persons because of that fact. This should be
obviated by putting into published form, suitable for the layman
or for students in schools and colleges, the vast stores of knowledge
which have been made by the staff of the bureau and its collabo-
rators. The great success of the Handbook of American Indians
clearly indicates the desire of the people for popular information on
our aborigines and the bureau with an enlarged appropriation would
be able to continue work of this nature.

In compliance with the act of Congress above mentioned the Bu-
reau of American Ethnology has continued its field and office re-
searches on the American Indians including the ethnology of the
Hawaiian Islands, and the inhabitants of Porto Rico and the Virgin
Islands. Later in this report is a list of the annual publications.
The high cost of printing has somewhat reduced the quantity but the
quality has been maintained.

The rapid modification in aboriginal culture perceptible year by
year in Indian manners, customs, and languages has led the chief
of the bureau to encourage archeological and historical study of the
Indians. Extensive researches have been carried on in Colorado,
in the Harpeth Valley, Tenn., in the Ozarks, Mo., and on the
Atlantic seaboard. In addition to archeological research consider-
able work has been done on documentary history, especially of the
Creeks, Choctaws, and other Muskhogean tribes.

Although the bureau has hitherto published many memoirs on the
Indians of the northwest coast, there still remains much ethnologi-
_ cal work awaiting investigation in this territory. A very promising
beginning was made in the study of the totem poles of this region
by Dr. T. T. Waterman, a temporary assistant on the staff of the
bureau who made a special trip to Alaska for that purpose. He not
only collected considerable new material on totem poles but also on
legends connected with them.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 65

The intention of the chief is to continue the work thus inaugurated
in Alaska, and to repair one of the old Indian villages for educa-
tional purposes. The former houses of the Alaska natives are now
rapidly going to destruction; Kasaan, one of the largest, was de-
serted and has been made a national monument but is suffering for
want of care. It is proposed to begin cleaning up this village, re-
pair it, in order to minimize the dangers from fire and vandals, and
put it in a condition to afford the greatest educational value to
future students and tourists.

The first duty of the chief being administrative in nature much of
his time is taken up by details of office work, in which, unless assisted
by the members of the bureau, he would be greatly handicapped.
The work of answering letters has greatly increased in the last five
years, and the demands on the time of those engaged in it have been
greatly multipled. This has affected all members of the staff, but
it is very satisfactory to record that the letters in reply to inquiries
are treated with the greatest respect and are looked upon as authori-
tative by the recipients.

When in Washington the chief has attended all meetings of the ad-
visory committee on publications and one or two other committees to
which he has been appointed. He has likewise accepted the welcome ~
duty of keeping in touch with all the archeological expeditions from
different institutions working on ruins in the area of the United
States in order that he might intelligently advise action to the sec-
retary on the requests for permits to carry on archeological excava-
tions, which each year are increasing in numbers.

The chief has made strenuous efforts to continue his studies of
previous summers on the Mesa Verde National Park in cooperation
with the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior.
In July, August, and a part of September he was absent from Wash-
ington and completed the excavation of Pipe Shrine House, a build-
ing in the Mummy Lake group of mounds. An account of the initia-
tion of this work appeared in the report for last year. This excep-
tional ruin was completely repaired and is now open for inspection
of visitors.

The excavation and repair of a circular tower situated 300 feet
from Far View House also engaged his attention from the middle
of July until the close of the season. The mound of stones cover-
ing this ruin was known as far back as 1915, but its hidden building
was not revealed until the close of June of the summer of 1922, when
it was found to be a tower with three subterranean rooms, called
kivas, which were evidently used for ceremonial purposes. Around
these rooms was formerly a crowded cemetery, of ancient date,
which led him to regard the whole area as a necropolis. The number
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

of interments was too large for the number of dwellings. The three
kivas belong to the highest type of these structures characteristic of
the Mesa Verde. In one of them there was a well-made wall of
secondary construction showing a secondary occupation and ruder
masonry. This kiva showed signs of having been abandoned and
later reoccupied, but how many years elapsed between the two occu-
pations was not evident from data available.

The excavation of this Mesa Verde tower led to new ideas of the
structure and use of these remains, hundreds of which are found
scattered in the canyons and on the mesas of the northern tributaries
of the upper San Juan River. This tower is a fair example of the
type of these buildings. It was probably an outlook for observations
of the sun and ceremonies connected with the sky god.

The first type of tower recognized in the Mesa Verde is a simple
lookout situated naturally on the summit of a hill or high elevation,
but unaccompanied by any other building; the second type has basal
rooms which apparently are used for storage of food or possibly
for habitation. Far View Tower is classified in a third type, in
which we have a tower rising from basal subterranean kivas,
granaries, and dwellings. The purpose of this type of tower is the
same as Pipe Shrine House.

During the greater part of August the tops of the walls of Far
View House were covered with cement to protect them from the
elements, and it is believed the protected walls will remain upright
for several years without further repair. The permanent protection
of these open ruins is always difficult and costly, but necessary.
There still remain many unsolved problems on the Mesa Verde
awaiting attention, but with small appropriations new ruins can not
be opened and those already opened can not be repaired.

Some distance north of Far View Tower is the depression long
ago christened Mummy Lake. Its true nature is unknown, though
it may have been a reservoir; but no mummies have ever been found
in its vicinity. In the thick cedars about it, situated on the right
hand of the road, there are several small mounds indicating ruins.
generally habitations, surrounding kivas. In one of these there are
walls made of large stones set on edge, standing above ground.
These stones project 4 feet above the surface, and their size has led
to the ruin being called Megalithic House. Excavation work on
this ruin was begun but not completed before the appropriation was
exhausted.

About every other night during the five months the chief worked
on the Mesa Verde he gave camp-fire talks to visitors and spent
considerable time daily in explaining the signification of the excava-
tions while they were in progress.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 67

In June, 1928, the chief made a trip to Deming, southern New
Mexico, and visited different localities, Fort Bayard, Central, Silver
City, and Pinos Altos, where pictured food bowls have been found.
He purchased a beautiful collection of pottery from the Mimbres
Valley, which supplements that already installed in the Museum.

In 1914 the chief first pointed out that the Mimbres Valley, in
which this pottery is found, was inhabited in prehistoric times by
a people who excelled all other pueblos in painting realistic figures
on pottery. The scientific value of these pictures is very great from
the fact that the prehistoric dwellers in the Mimbres Valley in this
way left a reliable and permanent record of certain occupations
(hunting, fishing, gambling), as well as wonderful representations
of mythological animals of all varieties. If we could truthfully
interpret these figures, our knowledge of the prehistoric mythology
of a people of whose history, language, and relationship we know
nothirig from documentary sources would be greatly increased.

Not far from the close of the fiscal year, President Harding issued
a proclamation declaring three’ groups of towers in southwestern
Colorado and southeastern Utah to be a national monument. This
announcement was particularly gratifying to the chief, not only
because it preserved for future generations good examples of unique
types of ancient buildings in our southwest but also because the idea
of the reservation of Hovenweep National Monument originated in
the Bureau of American Ethnology. The three groups composing
this monument lie within a few miles of each other and are locally
called Ruin Canyon group, Holly Canyon group, and the Tejon
Mesa group.

During the fiscal year Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, has com-
pleted the following manuscripts: “ Social Organization and Social
Usages of the Indians of the Creek Confederacy ”; “ Religious Be-
liefs and Medical Practices of the Creek Indians”; and “A Gram-
matical Sketch of the Alabama Language.”

Doctor Swanton also completed a card catalogue, arranged under
stems, of all of the linguistic material contained in the Arte de la
Lengua Timuquana, by Francisco Pareja, and an English-Indian
index for the same; and initiated a report on the stories of the south-
eastern Indians. By July 1 he had completed translations of stories
in the Koasati language and made a beginning on those in Alabama.
Material was added to his collection of references bearing on the
economic basis of American Indian life, and some map work was
done in connection with this phase of Indian life.

The ist of July, 1923, found Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist,
at work among the Fox Indians of Iowa. He collected sufficient
material for a manuscript entitled “ The traditional origin of the
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Fox Society, known as ‘They who go about singing’ (singing-
around rite).” This material will be published in the Fortieth
Annual Report of the bureau. A good beginning was also made on
the ceremonial “runners” and attendants. ‘Tribal dissensions at
Tama cut short Doctor Michelson’s stay among the Fox Indians and
he made a reconnaissance among the Potawatomi of Wisconsin, the
Chippewa at Reserve in the same State, the Ottawa of Michigan, the _
Delaware-Munsee of Lower Canada, and the Montagnais of Lake
St. John, returning to Washington near the 1st of October. He
definitely determined that there are several different Delaware dia-
lects spoken in Canada and the United States, and that some of these
dialects are not clearly related; so that the word Delaware is merely
a “catch all” term.

After returning to Washington Doctor Michelson devoted his time
to elaborating the paper above mentioned on “ The traditional origin
of the Fox Society, known as ‘ The Singing-around rite ’,” complet-
ing it for publication.

About the middle of May Doctor Michelson left for the field to
make a reconnaissance of the Algonquin tribes of eastern United
States and Canada, including the Labrador Peninsula. His obser-
vations lead him to conclude that the aboriginal culture of the
Penobscots at Old Town, Me., is disintegrating. None of the young
people speak the language, and with the constant intermarrying
with whites it will be but a short time when ethnology and folklore,
which are both well remembered, will be a thing of the past. The
Malecites living at the “village,” about 12 miles from Fredericton,
New Brunswick, cling tenaciously to the language, which is spoken
universally, though practically everyone also has a good command
of English. Their ethnology, on the other hand, is fast disappear-
ing. During his short visit with the Penobscots and Malecites,
Doctor Michelson determined a number of peculiar morphological
traits of the language as compared with central Algonquian. He
finds the phonetics of both languages extremely difficult, and on the
whole it may be said that neither language is archaic in type. On
June 13 Doctor Michelson arrived in Sydney Cape Breton, Nova
Scotia, en route to Labrador.

The beginning of the fiscal year found Mr. John P. Harrington,
ethnologist, engaged in the preparation for publication of his recent
field notes on the Picuris and Taos tribes of New Mexico and the
Mission Indians of California. All the notes on the Taos Indians
collected by the late Mrs. M. C. Stevenson were copied and arranged
for publication.

Mr. Harrington also prepared for publication a paper entitled
“ Picuris Children’s Stories with Texts and Songs.” This manu-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 69

script embraces Picuris stories in native text such as are told to the
Indian children on winter evenings in their little isolated village in
northern New Mexico. The stories have high literary quality, and
many of them hold the attention of child or adult throughout. The
volume is thought to be practical for school use. The 12 songs ac-
companying the stories are beautifully rendered by Mr. Rosendo
Vargas, and are transcribed into musical notation by Miss H. H.
Roberts.

Mr. Harrington also prepared an article on “ How the World
Grew,” which is an account of origins corresponding to the book of
Genesis of the Bible obtained from the Mission Indians of California.

Mr. Cipriano Alvarado, a Quiché Indian of the highlands of
Guatemala, was brought to this country for the purpose of ling?fstic
study by Mr. William Gates, who kindly allowed Mr. Harrington to
obtain from him a large amount of text material in this language.
The Quiché is the direct descendant of the tongue of the ancient
temple builders of the Central American jungles. In working with
Mr. Alvarado with the kymograph, Mr. Harrington discovered that
the Quiché and other Mayan dialects possess tones exactly like those
of Chinese, and that these tones, as in the latter language, are often
the sole means of distinguishing words that are otherwise pho-
netically identical. Work was also done with Mr. Alvarado and
Mr. Gates on the pallophotophone, a machine recently invented by
Professor Hoxie, of the General Electric Co. The pallophotophone
proved of the greatest value for the study of tones in Indian and
other languages, and its reproduction of the voice is true for all the
sounds, even including s, h, and those of like timbre which are im-
perfectly rendered on the phonograph.

On May 3 Mr. Harrington proceeded to Santa Barbara, Calif., for
the purpose of continuing his researches on the Indians of that State.
He succeeded in finding good informants for Indian songs as well as
stories and place names and obtained a large quantity of manuscript
material. This material consists of myths, place names, historical
notes, accounts of early life and customs, genealogies, and Indian
songs.

The Bureau of American Ethnology is doing cooperative work
with the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, of New
York City, which obtained permission from the Hotel Ambassador
Corporation to excavate the famous Burton Mound on the beach at
Santa Barbara. This mound has always been known as the site of
the principal rancheria of the Santa Barbara Indians, but former
owners of the property refused permission to excavate it, and when
the Potter Hotel was erected in 1901 hope of archaeological investi-
gation seemed forever lost. The site was unexpectedly made again
- -
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

available for study on account of the burning of the hotel a few
years ago.

The excavations began early in May and the Indian cemetery was
located on the slope of the mound toward the beach. The graves
that were opened were crowded with human bodies, trinkets, and a
great variety of utensils. Among the specimens are a fragment of a
soapstone canoe, soapstone pipes, fishhooks of abalone and bone,
sinker stones, arrowheads of great variety, spear heads, about 40
mortars, pestles, including some very long ones, beads of many kinds,
pendants, daggers, bowls and kettles of soapstone, native paint, ete.

Mr. Harrington has prepared for publication during the fiscal
year approximately 1,900 pages of manuscript.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, completed during the fiscal year
the second part of his Iroquoian Cosmology, the first part having
appeared in the Twenty-first Annual Report of the bureau. ;

During the year Mr. Hewitt spent some time editing a manu-
script entitled “ Report on the Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri,”
by Mr. Edwin Thompson Denig, to the Hon. Isaac Stevens, Governor
of Washington Territory in 1854 (?), which has been submitted for
publication.

Mr. Hewitt devoted much time and research in the preparation of
data for official replies to correspondents of the bureau. These in-
quiries in their scope touch almost the entire range of human interest,
very often seeking information quite outside of the specific field of
research belonging to this bureau. About 100 such replies were pre-
pared, although some of them required more than a day’s work in
preparation.

Mr. Hewitt also acted as the representative of the Smithsonian
Institution on the United States Board of Geographic Names.

On May 18, 1923, Mr. Hewitt left Washington on field duty. His
destination was the Grand River Grant to the Six Nations of Iro-
quois dwelling near Brantford, Ontario, Canada. At this place
Mr. Hewitt made an intensive study and revision and fuller inter-
pretation of his voluminous texts—texts which he had recorded so
fortunately in previous visits to this place. These texts embody the
traditions of the founding of the League or Confederation of the
Five Tribes of the Iroquois in the closing decades of the sixteenth
century. They contain also the principles and laws upon which it
was established, as well as the complete rituals and chants of the
Council of Condolence and Installation of the Federal Government,

was established, as well as the complete rituals and chants of the
kindreds composing the tribal members of the league.

He was also fortunate in recovering enough data relating to the
Federal and tribal chieftainesses to enable him to affirm the former
existence of a set of official names for every one of these women
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 71

magistrates. He also recorded much valuable information relating
to the several institutions of the league.

On June 24, Mr. Hewitt made a short visit to the Onondaga
Reservation, lying about 8 miles south of Syracuse, N. Y. He de-
voted his time on this reservation to a comparison of the limited
knowledge possessed by the only two men who had any definite
information of the various institutions and laws and installation
rituals of the Iroquois Confederation, with the records which he
possesses. The object was to ascertain, if still possible, how much
of his Canadian material, if any, could be said to be recent, or
whether the differences in the content were due merely to the break-
down of the traditions of the New York Onondaga. He convinced
himself that the latter was the sole cause.

Mr. Francis La Flesche, ethnologist, was engaged most of the time
during the fiscal year in assembling his notes for the third volume
of his work on The Osage Tribe. In this volume are recorded
two rituals of the Osage tribal rites. One is entitled Wa-xo’-be
A-wa-tho*, Singing of the Wa-xo’-be Songs, and the other, Ca Tha-ce
Ga-xe, Weaving of the Rush.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

In her studies of Indian music during the fiscal year Miss Frances
Densmore has included the songs of three tribes living in Arizona,
near the Mexican border. These tribes are the Yuma, Mohave, and
Papago. One of the manuscripts submitted this year deals with the
cremation ceremony of the Yuma, witnessed by Miss Densmore in
1922. The ceremonial songs of this rite were recorded and informa-
tion given by the oldest man, who has the hereditary right to sing
these songs. It is the custom of the Yuma Indians to hold a
memorial ceremony within a year after a death, at which an image
of the deceased is burned. After this ceremony the name of the
dead is never spoken. A full description of this ceremony was sub-
mitted, together with transcriptions of its songs.

The treatment of the sick by these tribes was also studied and
healing songs of each tribe were submitted. Among these were the
songs of a Yuma medicine man, who claims the power to cure per-
sons suffering from wounds in the chest, accompanied by hemor-
rhage. This shaman said that he did this by the aid of four insects
and birds, one of which has power over the fluids of the body. His
songs are cheerful and soothing in character, and it is interesting
to note that he forbade the people to weep during his treatment,
requiring that they “appear cheerful and act in a natural manner.”

Four manuscripts were submitted by Miss Densmore during the
year, bearing the following titles: “ Papago medicine and dancing
72 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

songs,” “ Dream and war songs of the Papago Indians,” “ Cremation
and memorial ceremonies of the Yuma Indians, with related songs,”
and “Lightning and medicine songs of the Yuma and Mohave In-
dians.” This material comprised 93 pages of manuscript and 84
transcriptions of songs, together with the original phonographic
records and tabulated and descriptive analyses of the songs. The
two most interesting musical discoveries made in this work are the
presence in these tribes of songs which may be termd “ pure melody
without tonality,” and the independent and elaborated rhythm of
the accompanying instrument, either a gourd rattle or a basket drum.
In many instances the accompanying instrument is transcribed sep-
arately from the melody in order to show its peculiarities.

During the summer of 1922 Miss Densmore visited the Chippewa
reservations at Lac Court Oreilles, Wis., and Leech Lake and Mille
Lac, Minn., collecting additional specimens of plants used in treating
the sick, and other data.

In the spring of 1923 Mr. W. E. Myer, special archeologist, spent
several months investigating archeological remains in central Ten-
nessee. He visited the ancient mound group of the Banks Link farm
on Duck River, in Humphreys County, Tenn., where was found the
celebrated cache of fine, long flint blades and other flint objects now
the pride of the collection of the Missouri Historical Society. He
made a map of this group and obtained additional information in
regard to these masterpieces of the ancient flint-chipper’s art.

Through the active aid of several citizens of Lincoln County he
was enabled to visit and study an important arid hitherto undescribed
mound group on Elk River, at the junction of Lincoln, Moore, and
Franklin Counties. He also obtained the definite location of over
75 unrecorded sites on which ancient man had lived in Lincoln
County.

He explored a small burial mound and other vestiges of an ancient
Indian village on the lands of Mr. L. W. Denny, Goodlettsville,
Davidson County, Tenn., where he found 20 skeletons. There was
evidence that two different tribes had occupied this site at separate
times in the past, and the mound yielded a number of fine artifacts
which throw light on the life of the people.

Mr. Myer spent two months exploring the remains of a great pre-
historic fortified Indian town in Cheatham County, Tenn., known as
the Great Mound Group on account of its great central mound.
With the assistance of Mr. Wilbur Nelson, State geologist of Tennes-
see, an excellent topographical map was made, and through the re-
peated efforts of Lieut. Norman McEwen, of the 136th Air Squadron,
Tennessee National Guard, some good airplane photographs of the
mound on the Harpeth River, near Kingston Springs, were secured.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 73

These remains cover approximately 500 acres in two bends of the
river. In one bend he found a bold projecting hill which had been
artificially shaped from bottom to top. Three wide terraces had been
formed along the side of this hill. The original rounded summit had
been leveled until a great plaza or public square, about 1,000 feet in
length and 500 feet in breadth, had been formed. Upon the sides
of this level plaza one very large mound and two smaller ones had
been erected. This section of the ancient town was protected on the
water side by the perpendicular cliffs of the Harpeth River. On
the land side it was defended by an earthen embankment or breast-
works surmounted by a wooden wall, from which at intervals semi-
circular wooden towers projected. These earthen breastworks, which
had formerly supported this wooden wall, were still to be found in
the undisturbed woodlands, where they yet extend about 114 miles,
and there is evidence that they originally ran much farther. Wooden
palisades, consisting of small tree trunks, had been driven into the
ground side by side and wedged together and the soil thrown against _
them until they were by this means firmly embedded in these earthen
embankments or breastworks. These palisades, bound closely
together and strongly braced, formed a wooden wall which had been
plastered on the outside in order to make scaling by an enemy
difficult. Earthen bastions projecting beyond this line of wall at
intervals of about 150 yards were still to be found. These had
formerly supported the semicircular wooden towers. The enemy
advancing to attack was therefore subjected to fire from the de-
fenders through portholes along the main wall and also to a flanking
fire from the warriors in the towers on these bastions. Faint traces
of some of the timbers of these palisades and wooden towers were
found in the soil of these embankments.

While the great central mount and terraced hill formed the most
striking feature of this ancient town, there were in the inclosure four
other eminences whose summits had likewise been leveled into plazas.
All these plazas yielded traces of earth lodges and other evidences of
former buildings. The earth lodges of the common people were
situated on the edges of the terraces. The larger mounds had prob-
ably supported important public buildings and the lodges of leading
personages. This grouping of important buildings around five sep-
arate plazas and in different parts of the town very probably indi-
cates that the population was made up of what had once been
four or five separate autonomous groups of kindred peoples. Here in
their later home each group had gathered around their own public
square in their own section of the town and thus preserved at least
some of their old ceremonials and held together in some fashion their
old organization.
74 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

It is impossible to determine even approximately the number of
inhabitants, but the large number of the buildings and the long ex-
tent of the walls indicate a population of several thousand. All the
buildings whose traces were uncovered appear to have been burned.
Below the fallen-in wall of an important building the charred re-
mains of the woven reed tapestry which had formerly hung upon
the wall were secured for the National Museum.

It is not as yet possible to determine the age of these remains.
Beyond all question this town had been destroyed long before the
coming of the whites. No object of white man’s manufacture was
found on this site.

Mr. Gerard Fowke carried on archeological investigations in the
Stratman Cave in Maries County, Mo. This cave, which is situated
a little more than 2 miles south of Gascondy, the point at which the
Rock Island Railroad crosses Gasconade River, has an opening on
the side of a hill about 150 feet high. The approach to the cave on
the river side is very steep, but from the top of the hill it is less
difficult. Mr. Fowke opened a trench on the outside slope of the
talus at a point 30 feet from the entrance of the cave and 16 feet
below the fioor level. He found most of the evidences of human
occupation in superficial black earth, scattered throughout which
from bottom to top were fragments of pottery, parts of vessels of
varying capacity and thickness; chert knives or spearheads, none
highly finished; hundreds of thousands of mussel shells more or less
decayed; and other objects so abundantly found on the numerous
camp sites and village sites along the Gasconade River. The arti-
facts were few in number and scattered throughout the mass,
nowhere more than a few pieces in a cubic foot of earth. This
denotes temporary occupation, at irregular intervals, over a long
period of time. Yet the cave was not altogether merely a resort for
temporary hunters or war parties. In addition to the pottery, which
shows at least occasional sojourning in the cave, there were frag-
mentary bones,.too fragile to preserve, of a child 2 or 3 years old,
of another somewhat older, and a small adult, possibly a woman.
These bones were found in different places but near the surface;
there were no other indications of burials. The only specimens
found worthy of note were a small hammer made of a chert twin-
concretion and bearing evidence of long service; a pebble, used for
sharpening small bone implements and for smoothing leather or
rawhide strings; and a double concave discoidal with V-shaped
margin.

While the results of the work at Stratman Cave contributed
little to the antiquity of man in Missouri, Mr. Fowke’s studies, which
are accompanied by a small collection, are valuable in a comparative
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY TA

way. The Ozark region in Missouri is yielding many surprises to
the archeologist and it is believed that there still remains much
field work to be done here-and in the neighborhood before the char-
acter and antiquity of the ®ndians of that region are definitely
determined.

With a small appropriation Mr. John L. Baer carried on instruc-
tive field studies on the banner stones in the Susquehanna River
region, and was able to make a good series reaching from the imper-
fect form into the more symmetrical objects. He also investigated
the pictographs found near Delta, Pa.

In November of last year Mr. Gill began to reclassify the large
collection of ethnologic and archeologic negatives with a view of
preparing a comprehensive catalogue of the linguistic families and
tribes with such historic data as is available. He has made good —
progress in this work. About 5,000 negatives have already been
catalogued.

LIBRARY

The reference library continued under the immediate care of Miss
Ella Leary, librarian, assisted by Mr. Roderick McPherson and later
by Mr. Thomas Blackwell.

During the year 500 books were accessioned. Of these 70 were
acquired by purchase, 130 by gift and exchange, and 300 by binding
of periodicals. The current periodicals annually received number
about 925, of which 35 are by subscription, the remainder being
obtained through exchange. The bureau has also received 200
pamphlets. The aggregate number of volumes in the library at the
close of the year was 25,061; of pamphlets about 15,100.. Satisfactory
progress was made toward the completion of the new subject cata-
logue from the old imperfect author’s catalogue.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY , fut

The most pressing need which confronts the library is shelving
for the ever increasing accumulations of books. Extensive shift-
ings and readjustments have been necessary during the year in order
to make space available where it is most needed, but the library is
totally lacking in facilities to allow for its expansion.

COLLECTIONS

The following collections, acquired by members of the bureau or
by those detailed in connection with its researches, have been trans-
ferred to the United States National Museum:

69367. Archeological objects from Alaska collected by Dr. T. T. Waterman in the

spring of 1922. (5 specimens.)

69530. Stone collar from Mayaguez, Porto Rico.

69660. Two incense burners found in a cave in southern Yucatan and presented
to the bureau by Maj. E. H. Ropes, United States Army.

69881. Archeological specimens collected along the Susquehanna River (Mary-
land and Pennsylvania) in October, 1922, by John L. Baer. (174
specimens. )

69885. Two stone pestles from the Isle of Pines.

MISCELLANEOUS

Clerical_—The correspondence and other clerical work of the office
has been conducted by Miss May S. Clark, clerk to the chief. Mr.
Anthony W. Wilding served as messenger and typist to the chief.

Mr. Roderick McPherson, messenger in the library, resigned March
31, 1928, and Mr. Thomas Blackwell, minor clerk, was appointed
May 1 to fill the vacancy.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 5
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the International Exchange Service during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1923:

The work of the service having returned to a normal basis, an
estimate of $45,000 was submitted for carrying on the exchanges
during the year, which is $5,000 less than that appropriated for the
fiscal year 1922. This appropriation was made by Congress and in
addition $200 was allowed for printing and binding. The repay-
ments from departmental and other establishments amounted to
$5,263.66, making the total resources available during the year,
$50,463.66. ;

The total number of packages handled during the past 12 months
was 377,826, a decrease from the number for the preceding year of
5,831. The total weight of these packages was 492,816 pounds, a
decrease of 99,784. This large decrease in the weight was due to
the fact that many of the packages sent abroad contained small
publications.

The number and weight of the packages of different classes are
indicated in the following table:

Although it is true that the United States Government sends
abroad more publications than it receives in exchange, the disparity
is not so great as appears in the table, for many foreign publica-
tions are forwarded by mail to the addresses in this country without
passing through the exchanges.

78
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 719

It was stated in the last report that the Government of Rumania
had been approached with a view to the reopening of exchange re-
lations with that country, and further that the Institution had ar-
ranged directly with the Institutul Meteorologic Central, at Buk-
harest, to take charge of the forwarding and distributing of exchange
consignments. During the past year a communication has been re-
ceived through the Department of State from the Government of
Rumania to the effect that the above-mentioned institute had been
designated as the official Rumanian Exchange Bureau. <A note was
received from Rumania, through the Relgian Government, stating
that under date of June 5, 1923, the Rumanian Government had
declared its adherence to the Brussels Conventions of 1886, pro-
viding for the exchange of official documents and scientific and lit-
erary publications and the immediate exchange of the official journal.
For a number of years the exchange of official documents has been
conducted with Rumania, although that country has only recently
given its formal adherence to the conventions.

The conditions in Russia ‘and Turkey have not yet improved
sufficiently to warrant the Institution in taking steps to establish
official exchange bureaus in those countries. The Institution has,
however, arranged with the American Friends Service Committee
to forward to Russia the large accumulations of scientific and literary
publications for correspondents in that country. Two consignments,
comprising a total of 70 boxes, have thus far been forwarded to
Russia in this way. The Academy of Sciences in Petrograd is act-
ing as the distributing agency.

There were shipped abroad during the year 2,223 boxes, being a
decrease of 995 from the number for the preceding 12 months. This
decrease in the number of boxes forwarded abroad, in comparison
with the number shipped during the previous year, is due partly
to the smaller size of many of the publications, to which reference
has already been made, and partly to the fact that the number of

boxes sent abroad last year was the largest in the history of the
' service, the usual number being about 2,400 annually. Moreover,
packages for certain countries were sent direct to their destination by
mail, owing to the fact that a suflicient number had not accumulated
to make box shipments when the regular monthly consignments
would have been forwarded. About 40,000 packages were forwarded
in this manner during the year.

Of the total number of boxes sent abroad 214 contained full sets
of. United States official documents for foreign depositories and 2,009
included departmental and other publications for the depositories
of partial sets and for miscellaneous correspondents.

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1923:

Since the expenses of the National Zoological Park, like those
of some other activities of the Federal Government, are borne in
part by the District of Columbia, the Bureau of the Budget has,
with the initiation of the budget law and for purposes of accounting,
included the estimates of the park within the District bill. The
act making appropriations for the Government of the District
of Columbia and other activities chargeable in whole or in part
against the revenue of such District, approved June 29, 1922, con-
tained an item of $125,000 for the regular maintenance of the park.
As an addition to the continuing appropriations available from
former years for the purchase of land near the Adams Mill Road
entrance, there was appropriated by Congress in the second defi-
ciency bill approved January 22, 1923, the sum of $3,096.34 to
complete the sum of $8,000 necessary for the termination of this
purchase. The bill providing for printing and binding, Smithsonian
Institution, contained an allotment of $300 for the National Zoologi-
cal Park. This was an increase of $100 over former allotments,
which had, during recent years, been insufficient for the needs of the
park.

Considerable progress has been made during the year in the work
of preparing for use the area between the great flight cage and the
main road in the western part of the park. This work was begun
* seven years ago but was discontinued during the war. Other minor
repairs and improvements have been made, and much effort has been
expended in beautifying the grounds, particularly in the parts of
the park most used by the public. The value of the collection is
greater than ever before; more species of animals are on exhibition
and the actual number of specimens of all kinds is greater than in
any previous year. Attendance records, for the fourth successive
year, have exceeded 2,000,000 visitors.

ACCESSIONS

Gifts—The number of animals presented by friends of the park
shows continued and gratifying increase from year to year. During
the past year 266 specimens were thus added to the collection. Many

87
88 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

of these are of particular value and, as in the previous year, special
mention should be made of important contributions from tropical
America.

Hon. Henry D. Baker, American consul at Trinidad, West Indies,
and Mr. William J. La Varre, of Georgetown, British Guiana, both
continued their gifts of South American animals. Interesting birds,
mammals, and reptiles were received from Mr. Baker, and included
in the collections made by Mr. La Varre were two fine specimens of
the dusky parrot (Pionus fuscus), a species of special interest to
the park. Mr. Gordon MacCreagh, of New York City, collected
and presented a specimen of the Brazilian red ouakari monkey
(Cacajao yubicundus), a species rarely seen in captivity and never
before represented, apparently, in any zoological garden in the
United States. Like the other members of its genus this monkey
is very difficult to keep, but this specimen presented by Mr. Mac-
Creagh lived in the park from August 25, 1922, until April 24, 1923.
a period of eight months. Among other animals from Mr. Mac-
Creagh was a specimen of the matamata turtle (Chelys fimbriata).

Dr. William M. Mann, of the Bureau of Entomology, while en-
gaged in work in southern Mexico, collected for the park a number of
interesting animals. Of special interest in Doctor Mann’s collec-
tion are two Mexican spider monkeys, four Maw’s turtles, and eight
specimens of Petz’s paroquet. The turtle and the paroquet are
species new to the park records. Dr. C. Bonne, of Moengo, Surinam,
presented to the park a fine young tapir; and Mr. C. E. Bergman, of
Norfolk, Va., contributed a specimen of the Magellan fox from
Chile, a species not before shown in the park.

The Canadian Government, through Hon. J. B. Harkin, Com-

Births—During the year 51 mammals were born and 29 birds
were hatched in the park. ‘These records include only such as are
reared to a reasonable age, no account being made in these published
statistics of young that live only a few days. Mammals born include:
European bear, 3; lion, 3; dingo, 3; gray wolf, 4; raccoon, 2; moun-
tain goat, 1; tahr, 1; bison, 2; Indian buffalo, 1; guanaco, 2; llama,
2; red deer, 7; American elk, 2; barasingha, 1; Japanese deer, 6;
hog deer, 1; Virginia deer, 2; Trinidad agouti, 1; rhesus monkey, 2;
mona, 1; rufus-bellied wallaby, 3; great red kangaroo, 1. Birds
hatched were of the following species: Mallard, black duck, wood
duck, silver pheasant, peafowl, and black-crowned night heron.

Exchanges.—Specimens received in exchange for surplus stock
include 27 mammals and 21 birds. Special mention should be made of
two Greenland musk oxen imported by way of Norway, the first ever
to be shown in the park; two mouflions, the wild sheep of Corsica and
Sardinia; a fine male nilgai from India; a clouded leopard, marbled
cat (Felis marmorata), and fire cat (Adlurin planiceps) from Su-
matra; a male panda from India; 2 black and 2 fulvous lemurs; and
a two-toed sloth. Birds received in exchange include, besides other
more common species, 3 kagus, 2 Victoria crowned pigeons, 3 black-
head ibises, 2 faleated ducks, and 2 eagle owls.

Purchases.—Among the mammals purchased during the year were
2 Alaska Peninsula bear cubs, 2 Alaskan black-tailed deer, an
ocelot, and 2 otters. Birds purchased include some very desirable
specimens: 2 Marquesan doves, 2 red-breasted mergansers, 2 sooty
shearwaters, 4 wood ibises, and a gannet. A number of more common
water birds, cage birds, eagles, and owls, as well as a number of
reptiles, were also acquired by purchase.

Transfers—Among the animals received by transfer from other
Government departments special mention should be made of a ship-
ment of 36 specimens of the Laysan finch, collected by Dr. Alexander
Wetmore while engaged in work for the Biological Survey, Depart-
ment of Agriculture, on the island bird reservations west of Hawaii.
The Laysan “finch” (Zelespyza cantans) is a member of an inter-
esting family of birds that is restricted to the Hawaiian Islands.
The specimens sent by Doctor Wetmore were all collected on Midway
Island. Some wood ducks, canvasbacks, and a collared lizard were
#lso received by transfer from the Biological Survey.
92 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

The Bureau of Fisheries, Department of Commerce, donated a
collection of 18 snakes of 5 species that were collected by Mr. F. E.
Hare at the biological station, Manchester, Iowa.

REMOVALS

Surplus mammals and birds to the number of 66 were sent away
during the year in exchange to other zoological gardens. Among
these were the following mammals that had been born and reared in
the park: Siberian tiger, 4; dingo, 1; red deer, 8; barasingha, 3;
hog deer, 2; Rocky Mountain sheep, 1; bison, 1; hippopotamus, 1;
Trinidad agouti, 2; rhesus monkey, 1.

A number of animals on deposit were returned to owners.

The death rate has again been kept at a very low mark. Except
for the loss of nine kangaroos from necrobacillosis, there has been no
evidence of contagion among the animals. Some of the losses of
animals long in the collection are as follows: A sandhill crane
(Grus mexicana) received January 30, 1899, died April 17, 1923,
from enteritis, after 24 years, 2 months, and 18 days in the park.
The great black-backed gull, “ Billy,” well known to thousands of
park visitors because of his long residence and sociable nature, died
April 18, 1923. “ Billy” came to the park from Labrador on No-
vember 22, 1905, and had thus been on exhibition for 17 years, 4
months, and 22 days. A male of the northern wild cat (Lynx uinta)
received September 3, 1907, died of old age on December 30, 1922,
15 years, 3 months, and 27 days after his arrival. A female guanaco
received January 20, 1908, died of disseminated tumors, after 14
years, 8 months, and 26 days in the park, on October 16, 1922. The
South American condor, male, received October 31, 1908, died June
15, 1923, 14 years, 7 months, and 15 days after arrival. The cause
of death, apparently, was lead poisoning, the bird having in some
manner swallowed a piece of lead of considerable size. A female
llama received March 14, 1908, died of anemia, July 25, 1922, after a
life of 14 years, 4 months, and 11 days in the park. A male
barasingha deer (Cervus duvaucelii) received October 1, 1908, died
January 10, 1923, 14 years, 3 months, and 9 days after arrival. A
female rhea (Rhea americana) received October 8, 1909, died May
1, 19238, after 13 years, 6 months, and 23 days in the collection. A
female brown macaque (J/acaca speciosa) received July 30, 1910,
died May 26, 1923, of broncho-pneumonia, after a life in the park of
12 years, 9 months, and 26 days. A boatbill heron (Cochlearius
cochlearius) received September 28, 1910, died from congestion of
the lungs, 12 years, 6 months, and 18 days later, on April 15, 1923.
The mate of this bird, received with it, is still living. A female
Woodhouse’s wolf (Canis frustror), born in the park April 17, 1911,
died at an age of 11 years, 8 months, and 15 days, on August 1, 1922.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 93

Two male Madagascar weavers (Youdia madagascariensis) , received
June 28, 1912, died on September 9 and October 14, 1922, respec-
tively; a record of 10 years, 8 months, and 16 days, for one of the
birds.

One of the most serious losses of the year was that of the female
whooping crane (Grus americanus), which died of aspergillosis on
April 16, 1923. The bird had always appeared in good health up
to shortly before its death; it was still comparatively young, and
had been in the collection since April 13, 1914, a period of nine years
and three days. It is perhaps doubtful if this rare species will
ever again be on exhibition in the park. Other serious losses in-
clude a female Rocky Mountain goat, June 13, 1923, metritis;
giant anteater, October 29, 1922; red ouakari monkey (Cacajao rubi-
cundus), April 24, 1923; frogmouth, November 1, 1922, tapeworm
infestation; and the Indian jabiru, March 29, 1923, from gastro-
enteritis.

As heretofore, postmortem examinations were made in most cases
by the pathological division of the Bureau of Animal Industry.
Fifteenth examinations were made by Dr. Adolph H. Schultz, of the
Carnegie Institution, Laboratory of Embryology, and one by spe-
cialists at St. Elizabeths Hospital, Department of the Interior.
The following list shows the results of autopsies, the cases being
arranged by groups:

of special scientific value, were Fe sei death to the
United States National Museum. A number of eggs of rare birds
were also transferred to the Museum. At the request of the Car-
negie Laboratory of Embryology, Johns Hopkins Medical School,
Baltimore, 27 specimens, mostly mammals, were delivered to that

institution for anatomical purposes.

One mammal was sent to

The number of species on exhibition on June 30 is 16 more, and the
total number of animals is 87 more than in any previous year.

VISITORS

The total number of visitors to the park, for the fiscal year, as
determined by count and estimate, was 2,393,428. This is 229,174
above the official record for 1922, and makes the fourth year in suc-
cession that the attendance has exceeded 2,000,000. The greatest
attendance in any one month was 330,700 in May, 1923.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 101
IMPROVEMENTS

The complete reconstruction of the wolf and fox dens below the
sea lion pool was finished early in the year. The quarters for these
animals are now much more comfortable and sanitary than before
and immensely improved in appearance. The outdoor cages for
rhesus and other monkeys were all repaired, covered with new wire,
provided with suitable water and sewer facilities, and generally put
into first-class condition. Repairs were made to the ostrich en-
closure, safety guards of electrically welded wire were placed along
the fence bordering the walk in front of the main bear dens, and
numerous minor repairs were made to cages and enclosures. In so
far as was possible with the limited funds, necessary painting was
done.

The principal construction for the year, however, has been the
continuation of work on the recently graded area in the west-central
part of the park, between the great flight cage and the hospital
building. This work was commenced seven years ago, but was dis-
continued during the war. It is greatly to be hoped that it may be
completed during the current year. After building a new road
from the hospital to the scales, near the Rocky Mountain sheep
inclosure, over the edge of the fill previously made, the old winding
road was abandoned and there was available a large area of flat
ground suitable for paddocks. Four extra large yards were designed
along the automobile road, where species commonly kept in breed-
ing herds may be shown. One yard has been especially designed for
Rocky Mountain goats and a miniature mountain of flint bowlders
has been constructed within it. The other large yards bordering the
automobile road have been prepared for red deer, barasingha deer,
and Japanese deer. On the south side, bordering the walk passing
the great flight cage for birds, are seven paddocks with shelters,
designed especially for Indian buffaloes, tahr goats, aoudads, axis
deer, and similar species. The water-buffalo yard has been provided
with a large tank for bathing, and the tahr and aoudad yards with
large rock piles. The axis deer shelter includes a closed room of
commodious size for breeding females, as this species commonly
brings forth the young in winter, when the weather out of doors
is unfavorable for young fawns. Passing directly through the center
of this system of yards from east to west is a service road along
which all of the shelter houses have been built. This system places
the retreats for animals at the rear of each yard, away from the
public, and, after proper planting, makes the buildings compara-
tively inconspicuous. It also simplifies care and the shifting or
transfer of animals without actual capture. At the end of the
102 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

year the yards and shelters were practically completed; the principal
work remaining undone includes sidewalks, parking space, tree
boxes, guard rails, and other minor accessories.

ALTERATIONS OF BOUNDARIES

With the approval on January 23, 1923, of the second deficiency
bill, there was available $8,000 for the purchase of the strip of land
between the park and Adams Mill Road between Ontario Road and
Clydesdale Place. The completion of this purchase adds about 8,000
feet of land to the area of the park and protects the entrance at
Adams Mill Road from unsightly development on one side. A new
danger that threatens the beauty of this entrance way to the park
has, however, most unexpectedly arisen. On March 4, 1923, an act
of Congress was passed and approved dissolving the cemetery asso-
ciation controlling the burial ground bordering the Zoological Park
on the south between Adams Mill Road and Rock Creek. The
trustees named in the bill are authorized to transfer the bodies in-
terred in this old cemetery and to sell the land. The permanent
highways plan of the District of Columbia shows a proposed road
across this property from Adams Mill Road to Calvert Street Bridge.
It will be necessary in order to protect this section of the park,
especially the beautiful roadway leading down from the Adams
Mill Road entrance, to acquire that portion of the cemetery lying
between this proposed roadway and the park boundary. It has been
suggested that the permanent highways plan be modified, and that
the proposed road across the old cemetery be made from Adams Mill
Road at the corner of the Zoological Park to join Waterside Drive
at Calvert Street Bridge. This would greatly reduce the area to be
purchased for park purposes and amply protect the interests of the

public.

Restaurant.—As pointed out in recent reports, a suitable restau-
rant building remains the most urgent need of the park. The old
refreshment stand was constructed many years ago of the cheapest
materials. At the present time it is in a bad condition and is wholly
inadequate to serve the needs of the public. The refreshment booth
at Connecticut Avenue, on land recently transferred to the Govern-
ment, should also be replaced by a new and more sightly structure.
The increased income from rental of these two concessions will well
repay for the construction of buildings adequate for the service of
the constantly increasing number of visitors.

Bird house-—The valuable collection of rare and interesting birds
now the property of the Government remains poorly housed for ex-
hibition purposes. Because of the great interest taken in this divi-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 103

sion of the collection and the numbers of beautiful and curious birds
from all parts of the world that are presented to the park, the col-
lection is constantly growing. The old bird house was built as a
temporary structure many years ago and, in addition to being in a
bad condition, is entirely too small either to accommodate the crowds
of interested visitors or to show to advantage the birds. Many rare
specimens, as a matter of fact, can not regularly be placed on ex-
hibition because of lack of room. It is greatly to be hoped that a
new bird house may be provided for in the near future.

Funds for purchase of animals.—The park has never had sufficient
funds for the purchase of animals. Rare specimens are from time to

-time offered for sale that would fill distinct gaps in the collection,

but because of lack of funds for their purchase these are frequently
lost to the park. Two conspicuous forms of mammal life—the In-
dian rhinoceros and giraffe—may be mentioned as examples. Oppor-
tunities to purchase good specimens of these spectacular species do
not often come, but because of lack of money for their purchase the
park has had to decline the few offered in recent years. In order that
special opportunities may be taken advantage of promptly, there
should be available from year to year a reasonable sum for the pur-
chase and transportation of animals.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Str: The Astrophysical Observatory was conducted under the fol-
lowing passage of the independent offices appropriation act approved
June 12, 1922:

Astrophysical Observatory: For maintenance of the Astrophysical Observ-
atory, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including assist-
ants, purchase of necessary books and periodicals, apparatus, making necessary
observations in high altitudes, repairs and alterations of buildings, and miscel-
laneous expenses, $15,500.

The observatory occupies a number of frame structures within an
inclosure of about 16,000 square feet south of the Smithsonian ad-
ministration building at Washington, and also a cement observing
station and frame cottage for observers on a plot of 10,000 square
feet leased from the Carnegie Solar Observatory, on Mount Wilson,
Calif.

A new solar observing station on Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., was
erected in July, 1920, at the expense of funds donated for the purpose
by Mr. John A. Roebling, of Bernardsville, N. J., and this station
has been occupied as a solar radiation observing station by the Astro-
physical Observatory since October, 1920.

The present value of the buildings and equipment for the Astro-
physical Observatory, owned by the Government, is estimated at
$50,000. This estimate contemplates the cost required to replace the
outfit for the purposes of the investigation.

Work at Washington.—No observations were attempted at Wash-
ington. Mr. Fowle, Mrs. Bond, and the director, as much of his time
as possible, were engaged in computations necessary (1) to the search
for systematic errors in the work of Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., and
the application of carefully determined corrections thereto; (2) to
the publication of a comparison of two years of observations at
Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., and Mount Montezuma, Chile (see
Monthly Weather Review, February, 1923); (8) to the preparation
of a new set of curves for use from January 1, 1923, in the short
method of solar constant determination at Montezuma, Chile; (4) to
the search for systematic errors and the application of carefully de-
termined corrections to Montezuma results on the new basis; (5) to

104
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 105

the reduction of observations made at Mount Wilson in 1922 on the
form of the solar spectrum energy curve and on the spectrum energy
curves of ten of the brighter stars.

It was apparent from the comparison just referred to between
the results of the two field stations that they were in close accord on
the sun’s variation. But the Chile station was employing in its
reductions the results of work prior to 1913 on the distribution of
radiation in the solar energy spectrum; while the Arizona station
was employing results of 1920. Moreover, the pyranometer in use
in Chile was of an old type unsuitable to the work. Furthermore, the
sharpness of definition of the spectrum employed at Mount Harqua
Hala was inferior to that employed at Montezuma. It seemed prob-
able that to remedy these defects and put the two stations on equality
in all respects would lead to even closer harmony in their results,
although it meant a revision of the whole scheme of reductions at
both stations, with a redetermination of the systematic errors at each.
This is very important, for the solar variations rarely exceed 5 per
cent, and are mainly less than 2 per cent. It taxes the best observing
to reveal them. These were the circumstances which led to the large
computing program stated in the preceding paragraph. It has re-
sulted in putting the two stations on equal footing in every possible
way. They are now capable of turning out jointly the best results
on the solar variation that our experience can suggest a means to
attain.

The instrument maker, Mr. Kramer, has been on detached service
for almost the entire year, engaged in the preparation, according
to plans of the director, of two solar radiation outfits ordered,
respectively, by a committee of interested gentlemen in Australia
and by the Government of Argentina. The Australian outfit was
finished and sent forward in June, 1923. The Argentine outfit will
go forward about December, 1923.

Field work at Mount Wilson.—Messrs. Abbot and Aldrich ob-
served on Mount Wilson in the months of July, August, and the
fore part of September, 1922. They redetermined the form of the
solar spectrum energy curve. For this investigation they employed
several different prisms, including two of rock salt. Their object in
this course was to vary the procedure, as far as possible, so as to
get several independent checks on the results. Upon reduction, all
of the results of 1922 came into good accord with one another, and
confirmed the work of 1920 very satisfactorily. It now appears
that a large part of the earlier work, on which results published in
Volumes III and IV of the Annals were based, was injured in ac-
curacy by the employment of a quartz prism of inferior transparency.
If this quartz prism work is rejected, the remaining early work is
106 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

in fair accord with that of 1920 and 1922. The new results, therefore,
now are accepted, and were published immediately after their com-
pletion. (Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, Vol. 74, No. 7,
1923.)

In the course of this solar energy spectrum work, the observers
made solar energy curves with rock-salt prisms at different hours
of the day, extending as far down the spectrum as to wave-length
14 microns. As yet these observations are not reduced.

A long and difficult task was undertaken in the observation of the
prismatic energy spectra of 10 of the brighter stars in the focus of
the 100-inch reflector on Mount Wilson. After much discourage-
ment in preparation of apparatus and preliminary trials, successful
results were obtained on three nights. The apparatus included a
special bolometer and a special galvanometer. Changes of tem-
perature of about one one-hundred-millionth of a degree Centigrade
were observable, and electric currents of about 10-?* amperes were
read with the galvanometer of 10 ohms resistance. So sensitive was
the device that it was affected to an almost incredible extent by
electromagnetic induction. It even appeared that the operation of
electric power in Pasadena and Los Angeles was effective to cause
disturbance through the transmission lines up the mountain though
cut off at the power house a thousand feet away from the telescope.
Accordingly, best observations were made after 2 o’clock in the
morning. The results are given in the paper just cited.

Field work in Arizona and Chile-—The Mount Harqua Hala sta-
tion observed solar variation throughout the year under the efficient
direction of Mr. A. F. Moore, assisted until April, 1923, by Mr. F. A.
Greeley. Mr. P. E. Greeley, who had been at Montezuma, exchanged
places with his brother and reported at Harqua Hala about June
8, 1923.

Mr. L. B. Aldrich assumed the directorship at Montezuma about
December 20, 1922, succeeding Mr. L. H. Abbot. At both stations
the results of 1923 have been very numerous. They had not yet been
critically compared at the close of the period covered by this report.

RESULTS OF THE WORK ON SOLAR RADIATION

As long ago as 1903, we found in the observations then being con-
ducted in Washington some indieation of a variation of the sun’s
output of radiation. These indications were pursued for several
years at Mount Wilson and Mount Whitney, and became so strong
that, in 1911 and 1912, expeditions were maintained in Algeria,
coincident with one at Mount Wilson, to test whether the supposed
solar variations were really of local character. The results seemed
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 107

confirmatory of real solar changes. The work went on in summer
months at Mount Wilson, with gradual improvements up to 1920.

In the meantime Mr. H. H. Clayton, forecaster of the meteoro-
logical service of Argentina, had communicated evidence, at first by
letter and later in two Smithsonian publications (Effect of Short
Period Variations of Solar Radiation on the Earth’s Atmosphere,
Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, Vol. 68, No. 8, 1917; and
Variation in Solar Radiation and the Weather, Smithsonian Mis-
cellaneous Collections, Vol. 71, No. 3, 1920), showing dependence of
the weather of various parts of the world on fluctuations-of solar
radiation. These indications he has now amplified and recently
elaborately published (H. H. Clayton, “ World Weather,” Macmillan
Co., New York, 1923). But even at the beginning, to one trained
by the late Secretary S. P. Langley to hope that some time some con-
nection would appear between solar and terrestrial changes, Mr.
Clayton’s work was very interesting.

At the writer’s suggestion, Secretary Walcott approved the ex-
penditure of accrued interest from the Hodgkins Fund to undertake
all-year-round observations of solar variation in a cloudless climate.
The Great War hindered the expedition, but it went forward in 1918
to Calama, Chile, a station chosen on the advice and extensive manu-
script data furnished by Dr. Walter Knoche, formerly in charge of
the weather service of Chile.

By that time Mr. Clayton’s researches had led him to believe that
actual forecasts might advantageously be based on solar radiation
work. Accordingly, soon after the establishment of the Chile sta-
tion, arrangements were made to telegraph its results to Buenos
Aires, and a system of forecasting based thereon has actually been in
use in Argentina for several years. Some of its results are quoted in
the book of Mr. Clayton, just cited.

The work almost immediately attracted the favorable attention
of Mr. John A. Roebling. By his advice and financial assistance,
the Mount Wilson work was transferred to a more cloudless locality
for all-year-round observing at Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., and also
the Calama work was transferred to a higher station, Montezuma,
outside the dust and smoke of Calama and Chuquicamata, which
had been serious inconveniences.

During these many years we had plodded on in hope of a satis-
fying fruition of our labors. Many signs there were that the solar
radiation varies sufficiently to be of importance in terrestrial con-
cerns. But they were of the nature of incompletely verified evi-
dences of various sorts, all pointing the same way, but none in itself
conclusive. With the continuous all-year-round occupation of the
two first-rate stations, made possible by Mr. Roebling’s generosity,
108 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

the matter could be put, for the first time, to a rigorous test. And
now we have made this test. It is conclusive and proves the sub-
stantial character of solar variation. Hereafter we walk by sight
where hitherto we walked by faith.

In the publication cited (Monthly Weather Review, February,
1923) -we show that in over 100 days, when results were obtained at
both Arizona and Chile, the average deviation of one station fromm
the other is 0.68 per cent, thus indicating a probable error of one
day’s observation at one station of 0.41 per cent. The average devia-
tion for two years of monthly mean values between the two stations
is 0.38 per cent, and this small value would doubtless be considerably
smaller if the individual days of the several months had always been
coincident. Although in opposite hemispheres, where winter at one
station falls in summer at the other station, there is no evidence of
seasonal divergence between the two stations. They unite in show-
ing solar variation. Indeed the march of the monthly mean values
from November, 1921, to September, 1922, in which they agree closely,
gives the most conspicuous instance of long-continued solar change
in a given direction which we have ever noted. The reader may
compare it with the four years of monthly means curve given at the
top of the illustration.

In short, there can not be, we think, any longer a reasonable ques-
tion that the sun varies, or that our observations can reveal these
variations satisfactorily. It is now a question for meteorologists
whether these variations are of importance in weather forecasting.
As we report these satisfying conclusions, it ought to be reported at
the same time that the financial support furnished the Astrophysical
Observatory by the Government would not have sufficed to obtain
these results without the aid of the Hodgkins fund of the Smith-
sonian Institution, and the generous financial support and wise
counsel of Mr. John A. Roebling.

Although done a few days after the close of the period covered by
this report, it will be fitting in this connection to mention some pre-
liminary observations on changes of the appearance of the sun accom-
panying changes in its output of radiation. Being at Pasadena in
July, 1923, the director availed himself of permission given by
Director Adams to examine two years of record prints from direct
photographs and hydrogen (H«) spectroheliograms of the sun made
at the Mount Wilson Solar Observatory. Four general rules or
principles seemed to be well established by the comparisons made.

1. When increased sun-spot activity appears, either by new spot
groups forming on the visible solar disk, by the growth of spots
already present, or by the coming on of a new group due to the
solar rotation, then on that very day the solar constant value in-
creases. :

b]
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY . 109

2. When a sun-spot group is carried by the solar rotation across
the central diameter of the visible disk, then the solar constant
value declines, and usually has a minimum on the day following
such central transit.

3. When many spot groups, faculae, or long strings of dark
hydrogen flocculi indicate that great solar activity is prevailing, the
solar constant is high.

4, When a long quiescent period occurs in solar activity, the solar
constant values steadily decline.

These rules connecting the solar radiation with the sun’s visible
appearance seem to hold some promise of quantitative development.
Possibly there may be found some formula for computing solar
constant values by the aid of direct solar photographs and hydrogen
and calcium spectroheliograms, which may enable the solar radiation
values to be expressed with fair approximation for the past quarter
of a century. If so, it will be of great advantage.

PERSONNEL

In addition to the changes of personnel above mentioned, Mr.
William H. Hoover was temporarily engaged as assistant beginning
March 12, 1923. He is in training to be director of the proposed
solar radiation observatory of the Argentine Government at La
Quiaca, Argentina. Mr. Hoover spent some time in Washington
and some upon Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz. Mrs. Arline Leary
served as temporary computer, beginning April 16, 1923. Both of
these assistants were paid from funds given for the purpose by
Mr. John A. Roebling.

SUMMARY

A comparison of two years of results on the variation of solar
radiation observed at Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., and Montezuma,
Chile, shows close accord between the stations and agreement be-
tween them in showing forth solar changes of both long and short
interval types. -Monthly mean values of both stations indicate a
long continued decline of the output of solar radiation beginning in
November, 1921, and continuing at least until September, 1922.
This is in some respects the most remarkable solar change on record.
Great improvements have been made at both stations, and their ob-
servations have been put as far as possible on exactly equal footing.
It is believed that beginning January 1, 1924, there will be still
closer accord in their reuslts. Definite correspondences have been
observed between the variation of the sun’s radiation and the varia-
tion of the most marked of its visible features. Several new deter-
minations of the form of the sun’s energy spectrum distribution
110 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

curve confirm the similar work of 1920, and lead to a revision of the
results of earlier work published in Volumes III and IV of the
Observatory Annals. Energy spectra of 10 of the brighter stars
were observed at the focus of the 100-inch telescope on Mount Wil-
son by means of a special spectrobolometric apparatus. Tempera-
ture differences of approximately one one-hundred-millionth of a
degree centigrade were measured in this investigation. Solar radia-
tion outfits have been prepared for Australia and Argentina, to be
installed in the year 1923.

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the United States Regional Bureau of the International
Catalogue of Scientific Literature for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1923.

As the success of this international enterprise, in common with all
undertakings dependent on international cooperation, is necessarily
controlled by world politics, it has been the hope of all interested in
the International Catalogue that each year conditions would develop
which would make reorganization possible and justify resumption of
publication. As international affairs, both political and financial,
are apparently still far removed from normalcy, the affairs of the
catalogue are practically in the same condition as they were in 1922.
As was noted in the last annual report, the Smithsonian Institution
submitted a statement of its position to an international convention
held in Brussels in July, 1922, to consider the affairs of the catalogue.
This statement carried with it a suggestion whose object was to keep
the international organization in existence, it being generally con-
ceded that should the countries who are now and have been for the
past 22 years officially cooperating in the support of the enterprise
be for any reason disunited it would be practically impossible to
ever regain their interest and support. Though these suggestions
were printed in the last report of this bureau, they are in part
reprinted here, as on them were based the resolutions to continue the
regional bureaus until reorganization could be accomplished:

It is the belief of the Smithsonian Institution

1. That a classified subject and author index to the literature of science is
needed.

2. That no better means exists of attaining the end sought than by carrying
out the original plan of the International Catalogue based on international
cooperation, guided by uniform rules and schedules modified to meet changes
in the several sciences, and, when possible, broadened in scope to include the
allied technical branches of these sciences.

8. That every effort should be made to cooperate with all similar enterprises.
including abstracting agencies, existing or projected, not only to prevent dupli-
cation of labor, but also to better serve the demands of those in need of
bibliographic aid.

111
112 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

4, That on account of abnormal conditions still controlling publishing costs
and monetary exchange, it is probable that actual publication can not be at
present resumed unless financial aid is had from some source outside the pres-
ent organization ; however, it is believed,

5. That the international organization should be kept in being through mu-
tual agreement to continue the work of the regional bureaus until such time
as it may be economically possible to resume publication. When that time ar-
rives the stock of complete sets already published should be advertised for sale
at a price within the reach of the smaller libraries and institutions, many of
whom, although desiring this unique reference work, were prevented from
subscribing on account of the high original cost.

Were the price reduced even to one-fourth of the original, stock in hand at
that figure represents a sufficient sum to meet all outstanding obligations and
leave a surplus for working capital.

This statement was read at the opening meeting of the conven-

tion and after a short discussion the following resolutions were
adopted :

That the convention is of opinion that the international organization should
be kept in being through mutual agreement to continue as far as possible the
work of the regional bureaus until such time as it may be economically possible
to resume publication.

That it be referred to the executive committee to consider and after full con-
sultation with interested bodies to make proposals as to the form of future
publication and to report with Some definite scheme to a meeting of the inter-
national council to be summoned as soon as it appears possible that the publi-
cation can be resumed.

The executive committee referred to consists of one representative
from each of the following-named countries; England, France,
Italy, Japan, Holland, Denmark, and the United States.

At this convention Prof. Henry E. Armstrong, chairman of the
executive committee, who is the only one of the founders of the cata-
logue remaining in the organization, submitted a report from which
the following items have been copied:

At the outset there was great enthusiasm for the work among those who
were its promoters in the different countries and great care was taken in the
preparation of the scheme; the organization that has been developed, in con-
sequence, has worked with remarkable smoothness. Bureaus have been estab-
lished in 32 countries, and the relations between these and the central office in
London have always been of the most harmonious character possible.

Most convincing proof has been obtained that international cooperation to
such an end is not merely possible but may be made most effective. That all
that was aimed at has been accomplished need not be contended; but the
obvious shortcomings of the catalogue have been almost entirely due to lack
of funds. To have established a system so widespread in its operations is no
small achievement in itself.

I am profoundly convinced that the principles underlying the preparation of
the catalogue are sound and that an international system of cataloguing
scientific literature is proved to be feasible and that its advantages are in-
contestable. -
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 113

-

It is the first work of the kind to be carried out in such detail and over
so long a period—more than 20 years. To abandon the enterprise after so
satisfactory a foundation has been laid would be to sacrifice an unique ex-
perience gained at the expense of great labor.

From the foregoing facts and opinions and from the experience
of all who have occasion to use bibliographical aids, in matters
relating to science and all its branches, it is apparent—

1. That there is a need for recording for the purpose of present and future
reference the published results of scientific achievements.

2. That such a record to be comprehensive and complete must be interna-
tional in its scope and therefore must necessarily be prepared through inter-
national cooperation.

3. That excepting for the organization known as the International Catalogue
of Scientific Literature, no such agency exists.

4. That, though not claiming perfection, the International Catalogue up to
the beginning of the late war was and had been for some 14 years answering
the demands and requirements of an international authors’ list and classified
subject index to the world’s literature of science.

5. That the principal defects of the International Catalogue were lack of
capital; lack of complete cooperation with enterprises similar in nature though
more limited in scope.

All of these defects had been recognized and their correction pro-
vided for by authority vested in the executive committee, whose plans
were frustrated by the beginning of war and consequent financial
collapse. It is believed and maintained by the advocates of the
International Catalogue that the foundation as it at present exists,
in spite of its financial difficulties, is the best and only one in existence
on which to build a new and more far-reaching organization, tres-
passing on no occupied fields, though cooperating for the common
good with all enterprises having the same or similar objects in view.

While many projects have been proposed and are now being advo-
cated, none either in plan or scope compare with the International
Catalogue and none have the international recognition and official
support necessary for success. The capital needed to refinance the
enterprise is so small in comparison with the results to be attained
that it would be strange indeed if in this day of large ideas and large
financial outlays this most promising bond between and aid for the
thinkers and workers of all nations should be allowed to remain so
crippled that its wealth of information must continue to be inacces-
sible because unpublished.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the
activities of the library of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1923.

Much has been accomplished, it is felt, toward better library serv-
ice. Principal original articles, appearing in scientific and technical
periodicals received for the Smithsonian deposit, have been brought
to the attention of members of the staff, through the continued
preparation of a daily list, circulated among heads of scientific bu-
reaus under the Smithsonian Institution. Books in the employees’
library have been rendered more accessible by their transfer to the
present quarters. Better protection has been provided for the older
accession books and other records by their removal to darker and less
frequented quarters, and congestion has thus been relieved in the
receiving room and in the filing cases. The number of publications
loaned during the year reached a total of 12,076, and fully as many
were consulted without being taken out.

Many rare volumes that otherwise would have required purchase
at great expense have been received in exchange or by gift. Back
numbers of publications required to complete sets have been re-
quested in exchange from societies and organizations abroad, and
many have generously responded during the year by presenting
valuable material, hitherto not available in American libraries. Spe-
cial attention has been given to the transmittal of Smithsonian pub-
lications in exchange.

FOREIGN PERIODICALS

A classified list has been prepared during the year of foreign
periodicals, exclusive of annuals and irregular serials, and the fol-
lowing table of subjects and languages is submitted:

BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESEARCHES

The third volume of the “ Bibliography of Aeronautics,” covering
the years 1917 to 1919, inclusive, compiled by the assistant librarian
of the Smithsonian Institution, Paul Brockett, was issued during
the year by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. The
first volume of this bibliography was issued in 1910 as volume 55
of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.

Efforts have been made for a number of years to compile a cata-
logue of the Watts de Peyster collection, Napoleon Bonaparte, and
a bibliography of scientific and technical periodicals, but up to the
past few years it has not been possible to devote much time to
these projects. During the past year, however, Mr. Condit has been _
able to bring together a catalogue of the rarer historical works in
the Watts de Peyster collection, and to prepare a classified list of
current foreign periodicals received for the library. The latter work
should not be confused with the larger plan, under way for many
years, for the compilation of a list of publications of learned societies
of the world in libraries throughout the United States. The com-
pletion of this project does not seem possible without the expen-
diture of a large sum of money, which is not at present available.
116 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

In the following reports of libraries administered under the
Smithsonian Institution, a decrease will be noted in accessions, the
natural consequence of the decline in publication abroad and the fact
that war accumulations were taken care of last year.

SMITHSONIAN MAIN LIBRARY

The additions to the main library, numbering 5,719, have been
transmitted to the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress,
where they are made available to the public. Documents of for-
eign Governments, received in exchange for Smithsonian publica-
tions, have been transmitted in accordance with the established
practice, without stamping or recording. The number of publica-
tions accessioned has now reached 893,307.

Theses were received from universities and institutes of technology
abroad located at the following places: Amsterdam, Basel, Berlin,
Bern, Bonn, Breslau, Clermont, Copenhagen, Delft, Dresden, Frei-
burg, Ghent, Giessen, Halle, Helsingfors, Karlsruhe, Kiel, Konigs-
berg, Leipzig, Lund, Rostock, Tokyo, Tiibingen, Utrecht, Ziirich.

A number of universities have temporarily discontinued the prac-
tice of sending the complete thesis, owing to the increased cost of
printing, and are now submitting them in abstract only.

Missing parts of incomplete sets were requested in exchange, as
in previous years, with an increased percentage secured, although
there was a decline both in wants requested and in wants secured.
Of 2,174 publications requested, 921 were secured, a percentage of
43.2 as against 39.1 for last year.

SMITHSONIAN OFFICE LIBRARY

The number of publications loaned from the office library was
2,756. The accessions numbered 378, of which 347 were volumes and
the remainder parts and pamphlets. Attention should be called to
the fact that no binding has been done for the office library during
the last six years, owing to lack of funds.

The progress of the cataloguing in the general library catalogue
of the Smithsonian Institution, kept in the office library, is shown

by the following statistics:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 117

Mention should also be made of the collection deposited by Mrs.
Charles D. Walcott, who has kindly extended the period of deposit.
It is frequently consulted by employees of the Smithsonian In-
stitution.

UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

The widespread interest of members of the staff and friends
of the museum is shown by the material donated during the year.
Among the donors are Messrs. H. E. Boving, A..H. Clark, F. W.
Clarke, W. H. Dall, Whitman Cross, C. G. Gilbert, O. P. Hay,
A. D. Hopkins, Ale’ Hrdli¢ka, Emmanuel de Margerie, W. R.
Maxon, W. de C. Ravenel, C. W. Richmond, 8. A. Rohwer, W.
Schaus, and Charles D. Walcott. The gifts of Doctor Dall to the
sectional library of mollusks numbered 168 titles.

Valuable material has continued to come in exchange from mu-
seums, research organizations, and scientific societies at home and
abroad.

The receipts of the year numbered 1,489 volumes and 2,796 pam-
phlets, bringing the total of books and other material in the library
up to 160,560. Of these there are 62,170 accessioned volumes. New
entry cards were made for 239 periodicals, and 138,314 parts were
entered.

Much of the library’s reference service is rendered through the
sectional libraries, under the immediate custody of members of the
scientific and administrative staff, located as follows:

NATURAL HISTORY BUILDING

American archeology. Mollusks.

Anthropology. Old World archeology.
Birds. Paleobotany.

Fishes, Physical anthropology.

118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

It will be seen that the use of the library can not be estimated upon
the basis of its loans alone. Many volumes are consulted in the
general library, the technological library, and the various sectional
libraries without being taken out. References are frequently re-
quested over the telephone by members of the staff of the Museum
and other Government bureaus, and every effort is made to comply
with these requests. Of the 9,220 loans made during the year, 5,191
were to the sectional libraries and 1,929 were borrowed from other
libraries.

The subject catalogue of the library has been increased by 4,400
cards. The arrangement of accumulated cards from the Concilium
Bibliographicum, received since the close of the war, has been
progressing and is well under way.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY LIBRARY

The requirements of the staff of the Astrophysical Observatory,
both in Washington and at the various stations, in the way of ref-
erence service, are met through the Astrophysical Observatory
Library. Loans are made through the Smithsonian Office Library.
There were added during the year 113 volumes, 27 parts of volumes,
and 54 pamphlets.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY LIBRARY

The activities of the Bureau of American Ethnology Library are
covered in the report of the chief of that bureau. The library is
administered under his immediate direction.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK LIBRARY

The library of the National Zoological Park, located three miles
distant from the Smithsonian building, contains supplemental ma-
terial of importance in the fields of zoology and park administration.
The increase for the year, as shown by accessions, was six volumes
and four parts.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

The National Gallery of Art Library is rapidly growing. Since
the gallery has begun the issuance of a separate series of publications
there has been a noteworthy increase in the material that has been
received in exchange. There were accessioned 128 volumes and 213
periodicals. Periodical parts numbered 740. The gift of the year
most worthy of mention is the large, handsomely illustrated volume
of paintings in the Bachstitz Gallery at The Hague.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 119
FREER GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

In connection with the art collections in the Freer building, a
large library was brought together by Mr. Freer. A catalogue of the
works contained in it has not been incorporated in the general library
of the Institution. There have been, however, 187 accessions in the
library, and 10 of these were added during the year. Many other
volumes belonging to the Smithsonian Institution have been depos-
ited in that building, to be retained indefinitely, most of these being
reference works and volumes relating to Oriental art.

SUMMARY OF RECEIPTS AND ACCESSIONS

The number of pieces of mail received during the year was 25,553,
of which 6,272 publications were Government documents, and were
sent to the Library of Congress, in accordance with the established
practice. Additions to the library, as shown by the accession records,
‘are given below.

128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

A piece of improved real estate, at 140 East Capitol Street, Wash-
ington, D. C., forming a part of the original bequest of the late
Robert Stanton Avery, has been sold. Payment in part was made in
cash and the balance by note. ;

The total amount of dividends and interest received by the Insti-
tution from the Freer estate during the year for all purposes was
$304,436.26. The increase in revenue was partly due to the settle-
ment of the estate by the administrators and also to the fact that
Parke, Davis & Co. declared a 100 per cent stock dividend to holders
of record December 18, 1922.

The itemized report of the auditor is filed in the office of the

secretary.

All payments are made by check, signed by the Secretary of the
Institution, on the Treasurer of the United States, and all revenues
are deposited to the credit of the same account, except in some
instances small deposits are placed in bank for convenience of col-
lection and later are withdrawn in round amounts and deposited in
the Treasury.

The practice of investing temporarily idle funds in time deposits
has proven satisfactory. During the year the interest derived from
this source, together with other similar items, has resulted in a
total of $1,732.50.

of the House of Representatives, and a regent of the Institution since January
9, 1920: Therefore be it

Resolved, That the board desire here to record their sorrow at the loss of a
colleague whose untimely death terminated a career filled with promise, and
whose interest in the affairs of the Institution made him a valued member of
the board.

The secretary also announced the death of the Hon. Lemuel P.
Padgett, who had been reappointed a regent by the Speaker of the
House of Representatives on January 4, 1922.

On motion of Mr. Greene, the following resolution was adopted:

Whereas the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution having learned
of the death, on August 2, 1922, of the Honorable Lemuel P. Padgett, a Mem-
ber of the House of Representatives, and a regent of the Institution since
December 15, 1917: Therefore be it

Resolved, That the board here place on record their deep sense of loss at
the passing away of their associate, whose career as citizen and statesman
was distinguished by lofty purpose and fulfillment, and whose wise counsel in
the deliberations of the board will be greatly missed.

DEATH OF FORMER REGENT

The secretary stated that Dr. A. Graham Bell attended the last
annual meeting of the board, although not in robust health; that
his fourth term as a regent expired on February 20, 1922, thus
completing 24 years of service; and that he had decided not to

133
134 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

accept another term. Doctor Bell’s illness terminated fatally on
August 2 at his home in Baddeck, Nova Scotia.

In view of Doctor Bell’s long service as a regent, it was suggested
that there be included in the records of the board a suitable brief
memorial of his life and work.

The Chief Justice then presented the following resolution, which
was adopted:

Resolved, That the executive committee be requested to prepare a memorial
commemorative of the life and work of Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, regent

of the Smithsonian Institution from 1898 to 1922, said memorial to be pre-
sented at the next annual meeting of the board.

A joint resolution providing for the appointment of Mr. John A.
Roebling, of New Jersey, to fill the vacancy created by the expira-
tion of Doctor Bell’s term, had been passed by the Senate and re-
ferred to the House of Representatives, but Mr. Roebling declined
the appointment on account of poor health.

VACANCY IN THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

The secretary stated that the expiration of Doctor Bell’s term as a
regent had caused a vacancy in the membership of the executive
committee, and that, under a resolution of the board of regents,
adopted December 10, 1914, the chancellor had appointed Mr. John
B. Henderson to fill the vacancy “until the next regular meeting
of the board.”

On motion of Mr. White, the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the temporary appointment of Mr. John B. Henderson as a
member of the executive committee be approved and continued until the expira-
tion of his term as regent.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

=
The annual report of the executive committee for the fiscal year
-ending June 80, 1922, in printed form, was submitted by the secre-

tary.
On motion, the report was accepted.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTER

This report was read by the secretary, as follows:

Hodgkins fund.—As stated in previous reports, $5,000 is allotted annually
from the Hodgkins specific fund for the maintenance of an astrophysical station
on the Montezuma Mountain, in Chile, where studies in solar radiation are
being carried on continuously. The work is under the direction of Dr. Charles
G. Abbot, Assistant Secretary of the Institution and Director of the Astrophysi-
cal Observatory.

Roebling contribution.—Mr. John A. Roebling, of New Jersey, has contributed
further funds to advance the work of solar research stations in Chile and
Arizona and the publication of results there attained. The contributions of
Mr. Roebling to date for this work aggregate more than $40,000.

Avery bequest.—All the real estate covered by this bequest has been sold.
The Avery fund now amounts to $41,283.

Poore bequest.—This bequest has reached the sum of $36,025. Under the
testator’s will, the fund must total $250,000 before its income shall be available.
Several lots of land in the city of Lowell remain undisposed of, but will be sold
as opportunity offers. A request has been made that the taxes on this property
be abated, but it has not yet been acted upon.

Freer bequest.—A note for $200,000 given for the purpose of liquidating
Federal and inheritance taxes against the estate has been reduced to $79,250.
A balance of $28,051.05 remains under the building fund and there are several
specific accounts with balances sufficient to meet current requirements.

Virginia Purdy Bacon bequest.—This bequest was given to establish the
Walter Rathbone Bacon (traveling) scholarship for the study of the fauna of
“countries other than the United States.” The invested fund now amounts to
$48,300.

Bruce Hughes bequest.—This bequest, which was given to establish the
Hughes alcove, has been settled and amounts to $11,604.53.

Frances Lea Chamberlain fund.—Founded by Dr. Leander T. Chamberlain
as a memorial to his wife, Frances Lea. It amounts to $35,000, and the in-
come is expended in the improvement and increase of the Isaac Lea collections
of ‘“ Mollusks ” and of ‘‘ Gems and gem material,” both in the National Museum.

Walcott fund.—The income of this fund, established by Charles D. and Mary
Vaux Walcott, is to be used for research and publication, and as time goes
on for such purposes aS may be designated by the Board of Regents. The
present market value of the securities deposited amounts to $10,460.

Addison T. Reid bequest.—This bequest, which is to found a chair in
biology aS a memorial to the testator’s grandfather, Asher Tunis, now amounts
to $15,079. The bequest was subject to the condition that the income was to
be paid in three shares to certain named beneficiaries until their death. Two
of these shares have been received and the remaining share will represent
approximately $5,000.
136 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Residual bequests—No change has occurred in the status of the following
estates, of which the Institution will become the residuary legatee, subject
to the death of certain specified beneficiaries:

The Joseph White Sprague bequest.
The Lucy Hunter Baird bequest.
The Riter Fitzgerald bequest.

The Caroline Henry bequest.

Consolidated fund.—This fund is composed of miscellaneous bequests and
moneys received in excess of $1,000,000, deposited in the United States Treasury
under the authority of the organic act. During the year several small bequests
have been added to the consolidated fund, which now aggregates $179,390.28.

On motion of Mr. Johnson, the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution accepts
the annual report of the permanent committee just read and approves and
ratifies the actions taken by the committee since the last annual meeting.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY

In submitting his annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1922, the secretary stated that since the last annual meeting of the
Regents 131 publications, comprising 7,785 pages, have been issued
by the Institution and its branches. The general appendix to the
annual report of the board to Congress contains a selection of pop-
ular illustrated articles describing recent advances in nearly every
branch of science, and the demand for the report soon exhausts the
edition of 10,000 copies.

On motion, the secretary’s report was accepted.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART COMMISSION

The annual meeting of the commission was held December 12,
1922, at which it was voted to recommend to the Board of Regents
the appointment for a full term of four years of Messrs. Herbert
Adams, Gari Melchers, and Charles Moore, their one-year terms hav-
ing expired. Messrs. Moore, Adams, and Parmelee were elected by
the commission to succeed themselves as members of the executive
committee.

The report of the National Gallery of Art for the year was sub-
mitted, as were also reports of the standing, special, and subcom-
mittees.

Messrs. E. W. Redfield, W. H. Holmes, and Gari Melchers were
appointed a committee to look after the interests of the National
Gallery in connection with the final disposition of purchases by the
National Academy of Design to be made under the Ranger bequest
fund.

The urgent need of a National Gallery building was emphasized
and discussion took place as to the advisability of applying to Con-
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS 187

gress for legislation to have the building project included in the
program now being formulated for prospective buildings.

On motion the report was accepted.

Senator Lodge offered the following resolution, which was
adopted :

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby
elects Messrs. Herbert Adams, Gari Melchers, and Charles Moore as members

of the National Gallery of Art Commission for the full term of four years,
their present one-year terms having expired December 14, 1922.

NEW BUILDING

The secretary spoke of the need of-space for the proper installa-
tion and exhibit of the Institution’s art and history collections,
and expressed the hope that a new building would be provided to
meet this need. No formal action was asked.

FREER GALLERY OF ART

ad
Work is being pushed as rapidly as possible in preparing the
collections, which it is hoped will be opened to the public in the
coming spring.
EXPEDITIONS

Through the generosity of Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia,
Pa., Mr. Charles M. Hoy continued his work of collecting for the
Museum specimens of the very interesting fauna of Australia. The
work was terminated during the winter and Mr. Hoy returned to
the United States in May, 1922. The specimens received during the
year bring the total up to 1,179 mammals, including series of
skeletal and embryological material; 928 birds with 41 additional
examples in alcohol, and smaller collections of reptiles, amphibians.
insects, marine specimens, etc.

Dr. Abbott’s unfailing interest in the national collections is shown
by the fact that he has now arranged to send Mr. Hoy to China for
the purpose of obtaining vertebrates from certain especially im-
portant localities in the Yangtze Valley, a region with which Mr.
Hoy has been familiar for many yéars.

Acknowledgment is made of Doctor Abbott’s generosity in financ-
ing previous explorations, and it is thought proper to state that up
to date he has contributed $31,500 for the expenditions to Borneo,
Celibes, Australia, and China, in addition to which he has con-
tributed largely from the results of his personal efforts in Haiti and
elsewhere.

In the summer of 1921 Mr. A. de C. Sowerby returned to China
to continue the work of exploration interrupted by the war. This
138 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

work, which is made possible by the generosity of Mr. Robert S.
Clark, of New York, will now be carried on in the region south of
the Yangtze, and the zoological results will come to the National
Museum.

Secretary Walcott, accompanied by Mrs. Walcott, continued his
geological work in the Canadian Rockies. Notwithstanding bad
weather and forest fires, the season was very successful.

THE SECRETARY’S SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT

The secretary presented a supplemental statement covering the
activities of the various branches of the Institution since the print-
ing of the annual report of June 30, 1922. These will be described
in detail in the annual report for 1923.

REGULAR MEETIN G, FEBRUARY 8, 1923

Present: The Hon. Calvin Coolidge, Vice President of the United
States, chancellor, in the chair; the Hon. William H. Taft, Chief

Frank L. Greene; Representative Albert Johnson; Representative
R. Walton Moore; Mr. Irwin B. Laughlin; and the secretary, Dr.
Charles D. Walcott.

DEATH OF REGENT

The secretary announced the sudden death of Mr. John B. Hender-
son, who had attended the last meeting of the board.

Senator Lodge offered the following resolutions, which were
adopted :

Whereas the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution having learned
of the death, on January 4, 1923, of John Brooks Henderson, a regent since
March 1, 1911, and since May last a member of the executive committee:

Resolved, That the board desire here to record that in the passing away of
their colleague biological science has lost an earnest worker, the Institution
a generous donor and ardent well-wisher, and the members of this board a
valued adviser and lovable friend.

Resolved, That these resolutions be made a part of the records of the board,
and that a copy thereof be transmitted to the family of Mr. Henderson as an
expression of the profound sorrow felt at his untimely death.

APPOINTMENT OF REGENTS

The secretary stated that the President, on January 22, 1923, had
approved a joint resolution reappointing Mr. Henry White; and
another appointing Mr. Irwin B. Laughlin, of Pennsylvania, in
place of Dr. A. Graham Bell, and Mr Frederic A. Delano, of the
District. of Columbia, to succeed Mr. John B. Henderson, deceased.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS 1389

VACANCIES ON THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

The secretary stated that the expiration of Mr. White’s term as
a Regent and the death of Mr. Henderson had caused two vacancies
in the executive committee, and that under a resolution adopted De-
cember 10, 1914, the chancellor had appointed Mr. White and Mr.
Delano to serve “ until the next regular meeting of the board.” These
temporary appointments terminated with this meeting, and it was
necessary that the board take action to fill the vacancies permanently.

Mr. Greene then’ offered the following resolution, which was
adopted:

Resolved, That the temporary appointments by the chancellor of Mr. White
and Mr. Delano as members of the executive committee be approved, and that

their membership on said committee be continued until the expiration of their
terms as Regents.

FINANCES OF THE INSTITUTION

The secretary placed before the board a number of financial tables
showing the resources of the Institution and the allotments for
carrying on its work; and urged the necessity for an increase of the
appropriations and of the Parent fund in order to provide for the
necessary extension of the Institution’s activities.

REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Senator Lodge, chairman, presented the report of a special com-
mittee approving drafts of a folder and a pamphlet intended for
wide distribution outlining the origin and purposes of the Institu-
tion, its various activities and resources, and its needs for the exten-
sion of its work. The report also contained a recommendation on
the question of the proposed recognition of the Institution’s bene-
factors and patrons.

The report was adopted.

NEW BUILDING FOR ART AND HISTORY COLLECTIONS

The secretary reminded the board that at the December meeting
he had called attention to the need for another museum building for
the exhibition of the Institution’s art and history collections. He
stated that he had taken this matter up with the congressional mem-
bers of the board, and that through their efforts an amendment had
been attached to the appropriations for the bureaus under the Insti-
tution, setting aside a site in the northeast corner of the Smithsonian
grounds. The act as passed by the House and Senate is as follows:

The Regents of the Smithsonian Institution are authorized to prepare pre-
- liminary plans for a suitable fireproof building with granite fronts for the

National Gallery of Art, including the National Portrait Gallery and the his-
tory collections of the United States National Museum, said building to be
140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

erected when funds from gifts or bequests are in the possession of the said
Regents, in sections or completely, on the north side of the Mall between the
Natural History Building, United States National Museum, and Seventh Street,
leaving a space between it and the latter of not less than one hundred feet
and a space of not less than one hundred feet between it and Seventh Street,
with its south front on a line with the south front of the said Natural History
Building.

The secretary added that it was his hope that the more progressive
American people would become interested in the development of the
National Gallery of Art and the history collections and in the pro-
vision of a suitable building to be erected on the site granted by
Congress.

HAMILTON FUND

The secretary stated that on January 23, 1895, the Board of
Regents adopted a resolution increasing the Hamilton fund from
$1,000 to $2,000 by the addition of accrued interest. He explained
that the increased fund yielded only a small income, and that it was
difficult to secure the services of suitable persons to give lectures
worth publishing, and also that there was another $1,000 in accrued
interest, and he recommended that the fund be increased from $2,000
to $3,000 by the addition of this sum.

Senator Lodge offered the following resolution, which was
adopted :

Resolved, That the secretary be authorized to increase the Hamilton fund
from two thousand to three thousand dollars by the addition of accrued
interest.

Other matters of interest and importance to the Institution were
considered and acted upon.

PROPOSED MUSEUM OF ARCHITECTURE

Senator Lodge brought before the board a letter from Mr. Horace
W. Peaslee, chairman of the Architects’ Advisory Council, on the
subject of a proposed museum where examples of the best archi-
tectural work of past generations could be preserved and urging that
the Smithsonian Institution should provide for such exhibits.

The secretary said that the matter had already been brought to
his attention but that the lack of funds would preclude any extended
arrangement at present.

After some discussion, Senator Lodge offered the following resolu-
tion, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the matter of the proposed museum of architecture be re-
ferred to the National Gallery of Art Commission for consideration and recom-

mendation at the annual meeting of the Board of Regents to be held December
13, 19238.

ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Gmnrrat Appenprx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such
papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific
progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previous had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geol-
ogy, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology,
and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not alto-
gether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1923.

THE CONSTITUTION AND EVOLUTION OF THE STARS?

By Henry Norris RUSSELL

The preceding lectures have, I hope, presented to you a picture—
drawn rather in outline, owing to the limitations of time—of the
stars as they are known at present, their dimensions, masses, densi-
ties, surface brightness, and the like. It remains to speak of what
has been done to correlate these facts into a theory of the constitution
of the stars, and their probable evolution and age.

What makes this problem tractable, in spite of the limitations im-
posed by the remoteness of the stars in space, and our ephemeral du-
ration in time, is that we have to deal only with the simpler and
more general properties of matter. The vast variety of the forms of
rock and mountain depends upon the solidity of their materials; the
still greater diversity of the forms of organic life is based on the
presence of chemical compounds of great complexity—and neither
of these conditions can exist at all in bodies as hot as even the
coolest stars. In the stars all matter must be gaseous, and the laws
of gases are among the simplest known to physics. Add to them the
still more general laws that govern gravitation, radiation, and the
structure of atoms, and we have the controlling factors in the evo-
lution of the stars.

Considering a star, then, as a mass of gas, isolated in space, we
notice first that it must be in internal equilibrium under its own
gravitation. The weight of the overlying layers produces a pres-
sure, increasing steadily from the surface to the center, which must
at any point be balanced by the expansive tendency of the gas, arising
from its high temperature. The temperature, too, is greatest at
the center, and decreases toward the surface. Hence, heat must flow
continually through the star’s substance, down the temperature
gradient, till it escapes by radiation at the surface. The supply of
heat must be kept up in some way; and one obvious process, as
Helmholtz suggested long ago, is the slow contraction of the star.
The work done by the gravitational forces in pulling the outer parts
of the star toward the center reappears as heat produced by the
compression, and maintains the star as a going concern. As the

star contracts, its density must increase; and the pressure will in-
crease too, for the various parts of the mass are nearer one an-
other, and attract one another more strongly. When the star has
shrunk to half its original diameter, the mean density will be eight
times as great.

If the star, after contraction, continues to be “ built on the same
model,” so to speak—that is, if the law according to which the
density increases proportionally toward the center remains the same,
except for the altered scale of miles provided by the shortened
radius, the density at any point, after contraction, will also be eight
times the original density at the corresponding point (distant fro
the center by the same fraction of the radius). :

How will the pressures at the two points compare? The portion
of the star nearer the center than the point under consideration is
compressed by the weight of the overlying portions. After the
contraction, every part of these is twice as near the center as be-
fore, and will, therefore, be attracted four times more strongly.
The whole compressive force will, therefore, be four times as great
as at first; but the area over which this force is distributed will
have shrunk to one-fourth of its former amount. Hence the pres-
sure per unit of area will increase sixteenfold, as against an eight-
fold increase of density. Applying the familiar laws of gases, we
find that the temperature of the gas, after contraction, must be
twice its original value in order that equilibrium shall still exist
when the star has shrunk to half its former size. More generally,
during the whole process of contraction, the temperatures at cor-
responding points will be inversely proportional to the star’s
radius—so long, indeed, as the star continues to be built on the same
model, and the simple gas laws hold good. This proportion was
first proved by Lane of Washington, in 1870, and is known as
Lane’s law.

It appears at first sight paradoxical that a star may grow hotter
by losing heat; but the difficulty disappears when it is realized that
the heat produced by the contraction exceeds the amount which is
required to raise the temperature of the mass to the extent de-
manded by Lane’s law. The remainder is available for radiation.
and it is only as it is gradually lost into space that the process of
contraction can take place. The manner in which the surface tem-
perature of a star, which determines its color and spectral type,
will vary as it contracts is somewhat different. As has already been
shown, the light from the far interior of a star stands no chance
of getting out to the surface, but practically all of it will be scattered
away by the gases through which it passes, and remain inside the
star. Light can only reach us directly from a relatively shallow
layer close to the surface, and it is a certain sort of average of the
CONSTITUTION OF THE STARS—RUSSELL 147
~

temperatures throughout this layer that gives the effective surface
temperature. As the density of the star varies, the depth of this
layer will alter, and in such a way that it always contains the same
number of tons of material per square foot, since it is upon this
quantity that the amount of scattering of light passing through the
layer depends. As the star contracts, the total quantity of matter
in this superficial radiating layer will therefore diminish propor-
tionally to the surface area; that is, the radiating layer will form
an ever decreasing part of the whole mass of the star, and its depth
will be a smaller fraction of the star’s radius. If the depth were a
fixed fraction of the radius, we could apply the law of correspond-
ing points and say that the temperature would vary inversely as
the radius; but, in fact, after contraction the new radiating layer
will form only the upper portion of the layer which “ corresponds ”
to the old radiating layer, and its average temperature will be lower
than that of the “ corresponding ” layer. On any reasonable assump-
tions regarding the way in which the temperature varies in the
outer part of the star, it is found that the effective temperature of
the surface will increase as it contracts, but much more slowly than
the central temperature.

All these conclusions are based upon the fundamental assumption
that the simple gas laws hold good throughout the star. This may
safely be assumed if the density is low—say, not more than 20 times
that of air—but when the density begins to approach that of water,
it will certainly be very far from the truth. As the density in-
creases, the compressibility diminishes, so that, at the same tem-
perature, it takes a greater increase of pressure to produce a further
increase of density than would be necessary in a perfect gas. In
other words, the material is better able than a perfect gas to stand
up under pressure. Hence, referring to the argument by which
Lane’s law was proved, we see that a smaller increase of temperature
than is demanded by this law will enable it to meet the changing
conditions resulting from contraction. Indeed, a point will in time
be reached when no further rise of temperature at all is needed, the
decreased compressibility of the dense gas taking the whole load.
Beyond this the increased pressure due to contraction acting alone
will be insufficient to produce the necessary increase in density, and a
fall in temperature must complete the adjustment.

We see, therefore, that a sphere of real gas, contracting under
its own gravitation, will follow Lane’s law only while its density
is small. As it contracts further its temperature will rise more
slowly than this law indicates, reach a maximum, and then gradu-
ally diminish. During this long process, the model upon which
the mass is built will itself gradually change—the increase of density
toward the center diminishing—but this will not alter the general
148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

character of the phenomena. We may at least say with confidence
that the surface temperature, as well as that in the interior, will
reach a maximum and then diminish, until at last the mass will
shrink nearly to the greatest density which it can possibly attain,
and end by cooling off almost like a solid body. During the early
stages, while the temperature is rising, the body will be of large
diameter. As it contracts its surface will diminish, but its surface
brightness will increase, so that the amount of light which it gives
out will not change much. It will, however, grow whiter as it
gets hotter, until it reaches its maximum attainable temperature.
By this time it will be much smaller in diameter than at the start,
but only a little fainter. But after it begins to fall in temperature,
while still contracting, the situation is different. There are now
fewer square miles in its surface, and less light given out per square
mile, so that its light will fall off rapidly, and it will grow fainter
and redder until at last it disappears.

During its history, therefore, it will pass through any surface
temperature lower than the maximum twice—once when of large
diameter, low density, great luminosity, and rising temperature, and
again when its diameter is small, density high, luminosity low, and
temperature falling. It is obvious that these contrasted groups of
characteristics are exactly those which differentiate the giant and
dwarf stars. The theoretical and observed pictures, indeed, agree
not merely in their general outlines, but in every detail. For ex-
ample, the lower the temperature selected for study, the greater will
be the theoretical difference between the groups of stars of rising
and falling temperature, and the greater is the actual difference be-
tween the giant and dwarf stars. The approximate equality in
brightness among the giant stars of the various spectral classes, and
the great differences among the dwarfs, find also a complete expla-
nation.

Stars of large mass, as can easily be shown, should attain a greater
maximum temperature than those whose mass is smaller, and should
be more luminous than the latter, for the same surface temperature,
especially in the giant stages. The great masses and luminosities of
the B stars are thus accounted for. They are not massive because
they are hot, but hot because they are massive. Lesser masses never
attain the B stage of temperature, but stop at A; and still smaller
ones may not get beyond class F, or even G. ‘As we go down the
spectral series, therefore, we are continually adding to our list stars
of mass too small to get into any of our earlier groups at all—so it
is no wonder that the average mass decreases for the redder stars.
The fact that the masses of the giants average high, whatever their
spectral type, is probably an effect of observational selection. We
have picked them from a list of naked-eye stars, and hence from one
CONSTITUTION OF THE STARS—RUSSELL 149

in which the brighter stars have an egregious preference, and it has
already been seen that, in these stages, great brightness means large
mass.

A more searching test is found in the densities of stars of the vari-
ous sorts; for here we can make our comparison quantitative in-
stead of merely qualitative. The stars of increasing temperature
should have densities at which the simple gas laws can be trusted
to apply, at least approximately; the dwarfs should be so dense that
we can be sure that these laws fail of application; while the hottest
stars should have an intermediate density corresponding to the
region in which the gas laws are strikingly at work. From a general
knowledge of the properties of matter, we can say with certainty
that a density less than ten times that of air falls in the first class,
one greater than that of water in the second, while the “ twilight
zone ” between corresponds to densities in the neighborhood of one-
tenth to one-quarter that of water, and perhaps a little higher. Now
we have already seen that the redder giant stars are less dense than
air—the whiter ones being probably from ten to fifty times denser;
that the average density of the A stars is one-fifth that of the sun,
or one-third that of water, while their individual densities range
from about fifty times that of air to that of water, and that the
dwarf stars have densities running from about that of water up
to four or five times as much. The agreement is perfect throughout
and there can be no remaining doubt that the proposed physical
model represents what actually happens in the stars.

This theory of stellar evolution was first propounded by Sir Nor-
man Lockyer, who outlines clearly the physical processes involved.
His criteria for distinguishing between stars of rising and falling
temperature were spectroscopic, and chosen in a rather arbitrary
way, with little explanation (though they were not very far fron.
anticipating Adams’ later discovery), and his views failed of
general acceptance. It fell to the speaker’s lot, some years later, tc
revive the theory, and point out the importance of the absolute
magnitudes, which, indeed, furnish the key to the whole problem.
This invaluable aid was not available when Lockyer began his
work—for in those days little indeed was known of stellar paral-
laxes—so that it is not surprising that his individual assignments
of stars to the classes of rising and falling temperature are ofter
erroneous. With the wealth of material now available, it is an easy
matter to point out stars in every successive stage of evolution, and
to assign the large majority of those for which we have data to
their place in its sequence. Mention should again be made, how-
ever, of the few, faint, but perplexing white stars of low luminosity.

1454—25——11
150 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

These do not fit into the scheme at all, and they present such an
extraordinary combination of high temperature, small luminosity,
and considerable mass that it is very difficult to form any consistent
idea of the physical conditions which exist on their surfaces. ‘There
are indeed more worlds for theory to conquer—and some of them
look as if it would take hard fighting.

But there are other ways in which our knowledge of the properties
of matter may be applied to the stars. A simple calculation shows
that the gravitational pressure at the center of the sun must be some-
thing like a hundred million tons per square inch. The pressures
in other dwarf stars are of the same order of magnitude. Those in
giant stars are smaller, but are usually measurable in thousands of
tons per square inch, even when the density can not be many times
greater than that of air. To withstand such a pressure, at this
density, the gas must have a temperature of many millions of
degrees.

What can we say of the properties which matter would exhibit
at these temperatures? Twenty years ago the only answer would
have been, “ Very little”; but now, with our knowledge of atomic
structure, we can say a good deal. The extreme violence of the
collisions between the atoms would knock off all the electrons of
the outer shells, and keep them off. The lighter atoms—perhaps as
far as sodium or even beyond—would lose all their electrons, and
be reduced to bare nuclei. The heavier ones would retain their
innermost one or two rings or shells of electrons, but lose the outer
ones, which contain a considerable majority of the whole number
of electrons originally present. We can be certain, however, that
the nuclei themselves would emerge quite unscathed from these col-
lisions, and that if an isolated nucleus, or the battered fragment of
a heavier atom, had a brief interval of relative quiet it would begin
to pick up electrons again from those which passed by slowly enough,
and to reconstitute the atomic structure. Could we remove a por-
tion of the matter in this strange state and let it cool, the familiar
atoms would thereupon rebuild themselves, bit by bit, and at the
end they would be the same as ever.

The principal differences at the high temperature, from our
present standpoint, are, first, there would be a vast multitude of
free electrons flying about, as well as the far heavier atomic nuclei,
so that the average “molecular weight”—in determining which
every free-moving particle in the gas counts as much as any other—
would be much diminished: Secondly, the gas at this temperature
would emit a tremendous flood of radiation, most of it of such short
wave length that it would resemble X rays rather than ordinary
light. This radiation would not go very far before it was scattered
CONSTITUTION OF THE STARS—RUSSELL 151

in all directions by the electrons, or absorbed in detaching some
fast-knit electron from the remnant of an atom, only to be re-
emitted when recombination took place. In either case the energy
would be relayed back and forth from atom to atom, now in this
direction, again in that, until in the lapse of ages it leaked gradually
outward to the cooler parts of the star, on its way to the surface.

Jeans was, I believe, the first to call attention to this extraordinary
state of things, and Schwarzschild to point out the fundamental im-
portance of the exchange of radiation in determining the conditions
of equilibrium within a star; but the general solution of the problem
came later, from Eddington, who was the first to appreciate one of
its most fundamental features.

The flood of entrapped radiation, in its attempts to escape, exerts
a pressure outward in all directions, just as a compressed gas would
do. The existence of this radiation pressure was pointed out long
ago by Maxwell’s theory of light. With any light obtainable on |
earth, even full sunlight, it is so minute that apparatus of the most.
delicate sort is required to indicate its existence; but at the tempera-
tures which prevail inside the stars it may amount (as Eddington
pointed out) to hundreds of tons per square inch and be an important
factor in preventing the collapse of the star’s interior under the
weight of the outer parts. Indeed, under some conditions, it may do
more than the gas pressure due to the motions of the atoms and
electrons, huge as the latter is. Following this lead, and working out
the laws of flow of energy outward down the temperature gradient,
he showed that certain simple and probable assumptions about the
opacity of the medium led to the conclusion that, all through the
star, the gravitational pressure would be proportional to the fourth
power of the temperature, and that the shares of this pressure which
were sustained by the gas pressure and the radiation pressure would
be everywhere in the same ratio. These conditions, combined with the
law of gravitation and the gas laws, suffice to determine completely
the model upon which the star is built, and to tell us practically all
that we need to know about it.

For the case where the simple gas laws hold, the mathematical
work had already been done by Emden, who found that the outer
regions of the star were of very low density, while there was a rapid
concentration toward the center, where the density reaches fifty-four
times the mean density. The central temperature of such a star
obeys Lane’s law, while the surface brightness varies inversely in the
square root of the radius. This means that the whole amount of
energy radiated from the star’s surface will be independent of its
size—the increase in surface brightness and decrease in area, as it
contracts, balancing one another exactly. The amount of the star’s
radiation depends upon the opacity of its material—diminishing as
152 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

this increases—and is also proportional to the ratio which the radia-
tion pressure bears to the total pressure at any part inside the star.
This ratio increases rapidly with the star’s mass, and the brightness
should do the same.

These conclusions form a theory of giant stars. To extend it to
dwarf stars Eddington repeated his calculations, taking into ac-
count the manner in which the compressibility of a gas decreases
with increasing density, and obtained a theoretical table which rep-
resents the way in which the absolute magnitude and temperature
of a star should depend upon its mass and density throughout the
whole range of these quantities. This table reproduces the actual
characteristics.of the dwarf stars and those of maximum tempera-
ture, as well as the giants, with a fidelity which is almost uncanny,
and far more than justifies its author’s modest claim that the theory
upon which it is based “ gives a fair approximation to the facts.”

But Eddington’s theory goes beyond this. It actually shows us
why the masses of the stars are so much alike, and why they are of
their actual order of magnitude. If @ is the fraction of the whole
pressure within the star which is balanced by the gas pressure, leav-
ing the fraction 1—§ for the radiation pressure, he derives by reason-
ing of a very general character, the equation

“Fe = 4.6 X 10-8 M?

where J/ is the mass of the star in grams. The extraordinarily small
numerical coefficient depends only upon a few very fundamental
natural constants—the gravitational constant, the quantum, and the
average mass of one of the “molecules” in the star (including in
this term atoms, nuclei, and free electrons). The numerical value
here given depends on the assumption that the last quantity is 2.8
times the mass of a hydrogen atom, an estimate which must be nearly
correct if the atoms are dissociated into nuclei and electrons to the
degree which has been described.

Now, following Eddington’s argument, we may imagine a set of
spheres-of gas, each isolated in space and in equilibrium under its
own gravitation and radiation, the first mass of 10 grams, the next
100 grams, the third 1,000 grams, and so on. Then, by means of his
equation, we find that the proportion which the radiation pressure
bears to the whole will be quite negligible in all the spheres up to
No. 32, will increase rapidly for Nos. 33 and 34; while for sphere
35 and all those beyond it the radiation pressure will be the dom-
inant partner, leaving little for the gas pressure to do.

Upon this long line of spheres, therefore, we find a small region
in which a certain natural factor changes from an insignificant to a
controlling réle. On general physical principles, therefore, as Ed-
CONSTITUTION OF THE STARS—RUSSELL 153

dington puts it, we would expect “something to happen” in this
critical interval, and “ what happens is the stars.” It is only when
the radiation pressure and the gas pressure share the gravitational
food that we get anything that can fairly be called a star. Smaller
masses do not give out light enough to make them visible at inter-
stellar distances, while the great ones, in which the radiation pres-
sure is almost sufficient to counteract gravitation, would be in an
almost unstable condition, so that a small disturbance, such as might
be produced by a moderate rotation, would cause them to break up
into parts. Hence smaller masses do not shine, and bigger ones
break up, and only those in the critical intervening range of mass
remain as luminous stars. We have seen that this should occur for
masses comparable with those of spheres 83 and 34 of the series.
Now the first of these is of half the mass of the sun, and the second
has five times the sun’s mass, so that the actual masses of the stars
fall very exactly into the range indicated by the theory. Since the
constants of this theory are derived from those which are the most
fundamental in modern physics, we may truthfully say that the
masses, and hence the sizes and brightness of the stars are deter-
mined directly by the fundamental properties of the very atoms
of which they are composed. It may be shown, for example, from
Eddington’s equation, that a mass of gas will shine as a giant star
when, and only when, the ratio of the diameter of the star to the
average distance between the atoms which compose it is about 20
times'the ratio between the charge of an electron and the average
mass of an atom (provided that this mass is measured, not in the
ordinary way, but, as in the electrical case, by its power of attract-
ing a similar mass at a given distance). The latter ratio is very
large, about 410’, so that the number of atoms in the star is enor-
mous, and the star itself a very large mass.

One of the most impressive consequences of the whole theory is
that the masses of the stars are determined by the interplay of
the two forces, gravitation and radiation pressure, which, among all
those in nature, are so feeble, under the conditions of ordinary ex-
periment, that it taxes the skill of the experimenter to build an
apparatus delicate enough to measure the effects of either one. Were
we confined to experiments in enclosed laboratories, isolated in space,
without the earth’s attraction to prove to us the existence of gravi-
tation, it would probably have been long before the very existence
of either of these forces would have been suspected; yet these forces,
and these alone, when working on the grand scale, are powerful
enough to shape the stars.

One question still remains. How long a time is required for
this sequence of evolutionary changes? What is the life of a star?
154 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Here, again, the answer which we would now give depends upon
knowledge which has come within the last decade or two. We have,
even now, no direct evidence regarding the age of the stars, or the
sun; but we have information about the age of the earth that has
magnified our conception of the duration of the universe in time, in
as startling a fashion as the study of the globular clusters has en-
larged our idea of its extension in space.

The new method of measuring time is really very simple. Ura-
nium is radioactive, and slowly “decays.” One by one its atoms
eject a part of their nuclei, and change into atoms of a different
element. These again break up, and so on through a long and
wonderful series of transformations, in which radium is one step.
The particle ejected from the nucleus is sometimes an electron, but
oftener an alpha particle, identical with the nucleus of a helium
atom. Finally, at the end of the list, there remains a stable atom of
lead—but not of ordinary lead, for its atomic weight is 206, instead
of 207 as usual. In the course of ages, this radio-lead must accumu-
late in all uranium minerals. The rate of accumulation is accurately
known, from a study of radioactive phenomena and we can be sure
that the weight of lead produced in a million years is one eight-
thousandth of that of the uranium which is present. By determin-
ing the percentages of uranium and lead now present in a mineral,
and applying this principle, we can find out how old the mineral
is—provided, of course, that it contained no lead when it was origi-
nally formed by crystallization in the molten rock mass. Such
primitive lead would, however, be ordinary lead, of higher atomic
weight, and a determination of the atomic weight of the lead de-
rived from our specimen will enable us to tell how much of it was
there when the mineral formed, and how much has been produced by
radioactivity since this time.

In this way reliable values can be obtained for the ages of various
minerals, and the dates of the eruption of the rocks in which they
occur. The latter can often be defined in geological terms, and
hence we can date the various geologic periods, finding a good
general agreement with the geological order of succession. The
oldest minerals so far studied are found in rocks of Middle Pre-
Cambrian age. Specimens from Europe. Africa, and America agree
in giving ages of between 1,000 and 1,200 millions of years. These
individual crystals have been in the rocks for all this time. The
earth, as a planet, must be older. The speaker, from consideration
of the whole amount of uranium and lead in the earth’s crust, showed
last year that its age is apparently less than eight billions of years,
and probably something like 4 billions. If, as seems most probable,
the planets were produced by eruptions from the sun, under the tidal
CONSTITUTION OF THE STARS—RUSSELL 155

influence of a passing star, the sun itself must have been already
formed at that remote epoch.

But we may go further. Life already existed on the earth in
Cambrian times, and it is a moderate estimate to say that the process
of organic evolution has lasted for a billion years. During all this
time the sun can never have been one stellar magnitude brighter
or fainter than it is now; for in the first case, its heat would have
raised the oceans to the boiling point, and, in the second, they would
have frozen solid—and either of these catastrophes would have put
an end to evolution and to all terrestrial life. Now the sun is a
typical dwarf star, and there is good reason to believe that it is now
well advanced in cooling and was once much brighter and hotter
than it is now—of class F, at least, though perhaps not of class A.
At such a time it must have been at least two magnitudes brighter
than at present. Yet in the whole of geological time it has probably
decreased half a magnitude or less. We may, therefore, say, with
considerable confidence, that the life of the sun, and doubtless also
of the stars in general, must extend over many billions of years.

But here we meet with a serious difficulty. We know the rate
at which the sun is radiating energy to the earth, and, from con-
sideration of the way in which the earth in turn radiates this energy
into space, we can be sure that the sun is also sending out an equal
amount of heat into space in every direction. The total output is
so great that it would exhaust the whole huge fund of energy which
would be made available by the sun’s contraction from an indefinitely
extended size, in about twenty million years, as Lord Kelvin showed
long ago. When we allow for the fact that some of this heat is
still stored in the sun’s interior, and that it was probably much
brighter in its earlier stages of evolution than at present, we see
that, if gravitational energy alone was available as the source of its
radiation, the sun’s past life as a star must have occupied but a very
few million years. In view of the geological and radioactive evi-
dence, there seems to be no escape from the conclusion that the sun
must have some other, and far greater, store of internal energy upon
which to draw.

Further evidence in favor of this view has been found by Edding-
ton in the behavior of the star Delta Cephei. This is a typical giant
star, about eight hundred times as bright as the sun. Eddington has
given good reason to believe that the cause of its variation in light
is a periodic expansion and contraction of the whole star by about
10 per cent on each side of the mean. The period of this change
would depend on the density of the star, and diminish if this im-
creased. Hence, if the mean diameter was gradually contracting,
the period should shorten. Eddington calculates that, if the radia-
tion is supplied by gravitational contraction alone, the period should

156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

decrease by about 40 seconds per year. The observations, which
cover more than a century, show indeed a decrease of period, but
at the rate of about a second in 12 years—five hundred times slower
than the previous theory would demand. Here again we have evi-
dence that the rate of stellar evolution—in a giant star this time—is
many hundreds of times slower than it would be if there was not
some internal store of energy to draw upon.

It is certain that no corresponding evolution of heat from any
source occurs within the earth, and we must therefore suppose that
energy from the “unknown source” becomes available only at
exceedingly high temperatures, such as prevail inside the stars. But
if this is the case, and a star, in contracting, gets hot enough inside
to start this process going, why does this not make the interior
still hotter, and so cause a still more rapid transformation of the
unknown energy into heat, till the process ends in an explosion on
wu colossal scale? I mulled over this idea for a couple of years
before I saw the simple answer. If heat energy is supplied to the
interior of a giant star, the star will have to expand, and if it ex-
pands, it must grow cooler. The process is the exact reverse of
that by which contraction makes the star hotter, and at the same
time compels the escape of heat from the surface into space. Hence,
if too much heat is supplied from the unknown source, the star
will expand and cool, shutting off further supplies. It is easy to
see that we have here a self-regulating process, which, in the long
run, will automatically adjust the supply of heat in the interior
so that it just makes up the loss due to leakage toward the surface
and radiation into space. In the short run, we might find alternate
overproduction, leading to expansion of the star and cooling, and
underproduction, permitting contraction and heating; and oscilla-
tions of just this sort appear to happen in the Cepheid variables.
Though the star may thus be kept shining for a very long time, it
can not go on forever, for the store of internal energy, however
vast, must be finite, and will gradually be used up. As this hap-
pens, the star will contract, although very slowly, and ultimately pass
through the various giant and dwarf stages, in substantially the man-
ner which was described earlier.

Such a store of available energy will account for the facts; but
how shall we attempt to account for the store of energy itself? One
thing is clear at the start. The only places small enough to contain
so huge an accumulation are the nuclei of the atoms. I say “small”
advisedly, for it is only when the constituent parts of which the
atoms are built come exceedingly close together that the forces be-
tween them can become great enough to account for their possession
of such an amount of energy. Radioactive energy, which comes
CONSTITUTION OF THE STARS—RUSSELL t57

trom atomic nuclei, represents indeed one such gigantic store. But
the amount of energy which must once have been stored in each
gram of the sun’s mass, to account for its past radiation of heat, is
even greater than that contained in uranium. We can not do more
than guess where it may have been hidden; but one verv recent piece
of work affords a possible clue.

Aston, in one of the brilliant researches which we have learned
to associate with the Cavandish Laboratory at Cambridge, has in-
vented a beautiful apparatus which sorts atoms, by giving them elec-
trical charges and shooting them through a vacuum under the in-
fluence of electric and magnetic fields. The resulting forces deflect
atoms of different weights in different directions, and bring each
kind to a separate focus upon a photographic plate, producing
images when the plate is developed. By measuring these plates the
atomic weights may be determined; and Aston has found that, in
every case but one, the true atomic weights are exact integers,
within the accuracy of measurement, which is about 1 part in 1,000.
When the chemist finds an atomic weight which is not an integer,
such as 35.46 for chlorine, this is really the average for two different
kinds of atoms of the same chemical properties, but different weights,
both of which are integers—35 and 37 in this case. The one ex-
ception is hydrogen, for which the chemist’s determination 1.008 is
exactly confirmed.

Now it is more than a century since Prout suggested that, since
the atomic weights are so nearly integers, the atoms themselves are
built up out of simple units. We now transfer this idea to the
atomic nuclei, which contain practically all the mass, and Aston’s
beautiful researches practically compel belief. The hydrogen nucleus,
or “ proton,” is the lightest of all, and we would naturally look
to it as the fundamental unit. Rutherford’s success in knocking
the nuclei of elements such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sodium to bits,
by collision with fast-moving alpha particles, has furnished a
definite proof that protons, and alpha particles as well, are actual
constitutents of these nuclei. Many nuclei must also contain elec-
trons, which prevent the net electric charge from getting too high.
It looks, for example, as if an alpha particle was built of four
protons and two electrons, held together by forces of whose nature
we are ignorant. This would give exactly the right electric charge;
but the mass of the four protons would be greater than that of
the alpha particle by 1 part in 130. (The electrons weigh next to
nothing.) This seems to spoil the explanation altogether, but an
escape is found in that great resolver of otherwise intractable dif-
ficulties, the principle of relativity. According to this, all energy
has mass, and all mass is equivalent to energy. The loss of mass in

1454—25——_12
158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

the formation of the alpha particle would mean that, in forming it,
energy would be liberated, which would have to be put back into
it again in order to separate the parts. The calculated amount of
energy is so enormously great that it is not at all surprising that the
alpha particle is so stable. Even in the collisions with other atomic
nuclei which shatter the latter into fragments, the forces (which can
be roughly calculated) are not nearly strong enough to disintegrate
it.

We may now suppose that, in the interior of the stars, and by
some process the details of which are still quite unknown, the atoms
of hydrogen are taken apart, and the pieces—protons and electrons—
built up into the nuclei of heavier atoms, with just enough elec-
trons left over to build the outer parts of these. We can not be
sure, of course, that such a thing actually happens; but if it does,
the energy liberated will suffice for the present demands of astro-
physics. If the sun, for example, was originally all hydrogen,
which was transformed in this fashion into other elements, the
energy which would be set free as a by-product would keep it
shining at the present rate for about 120 billions of years.

Such is our present conception of the stars, their distance, their
age, their nature, and their life history. In the grandeur of its
sweep in space and time, and the beauty and simplicity of the re-
lations which it discloses between the greatest and the smallest
things of which we know, it reveals as perhaps nothing else does,
the majesty of the order about us which we call nature, and, as I
believe, of that Power behind the order, of which it is but a passing
shadow.

THE SUN AND SUNSPOTS, 1820-1920?

By E. WALTER MAUNDER

[With 7 plates]

The Royal Astronomical Society was founded in 1820. At that
date it was known that there was a sun, that sometimes there were
spots upon its surface, and that the sun rotated on its axis. Prac-
tically that was all.

In 1826, the systematic study of the sun’s surface was commenced
by Schwabe, and it has been continued up to the present time.
Schwabe presented his drawings to the Royal Astronomical Society ;
and as it also possesses those of some of his predecessors in the same
field, this society now holds records of one kind or another showing
the changes that have taken place upon the solar surface from the
year 1820, and so continuously to the present date.

The question before us this evening is: What views do we now hold
of the constitution of the sun and the relationships of its spots, and
upon what facts do we base them?

A quarter of an hour is a short time in which to review the scien-
tific evolution of a century, even when the inquiry is restricted to a
single department of astronomy, so confined that it deals only with
sunspots as drawn at the telescope, or impressed upon the photo-
graph plate.

My first illustration (fig. 1) deals with the annual percentages of
spotless days, 1826-1923, and is an extension of that appearing in the
Monthly Notices, 74, Plate 4, between pages 114 and 115. It is based
upon Schwabe’s persistent daily count of sunspots. In itself, his
work was very simple and straightforward, but it was carried on
systematically and with the utmost patience. These qualities made
it great and epoch making, and they were acknowledged by the
award to him, in 1857, of the gold medal of this society.

The diagram is deduced, partly from the observations of Schwabe;
partly from those of R. Wolf; and from 1885 to the present time
from the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results. It exhibits for each

year from 1826 to 1923 the percentage of the days of observation
upon which the sun appeared to be free from spots. It shows clearly
that all years are not equally prolific as to sunspots. Confining
ourselves to the years represented, it appears that there were eight
cycles completed when there was a most marked absence of spots; a
ninth cycle being now nearly completed. The dates of such absences
are very clearly defined and are marked by the actual year inserted
just above the apices. In the ninety-eight years represented there
is in no case any doubt as to the year of the greatest solar quiescence,
and a simple examination of the curve demonstrates that the average
length of the interval, from one year of greatest quiescence to the
next, was nearly 111% years, and that the range in length of that in-
terval was from 10 to 13 years.

This interval is often spoken of as “the sun-spot period.” The use
_of the word “ period” has been unfortunate, for it has given rise to
an impression which is not in accord with the facts of the case.
Let us speak of it in future as “the sun-spot cycle.” A series of
events may be, and often is, “cyclical” without being in the usual
mathematical sense “ periodic”; but we are not, at present, justified
in applying the term “ period,” in its strictest mathematical sense,
to the interval that occurs between one sun-spot minimum and the
next.

The second illustration (fig. 2) gives a somewhat fuller study,
derived from the measures of the areas of sunspots made at Green-
wich Observatory on the photographs of the sun, taken during the
years 1874-1923; it is an extension of a similar diagram given in the
Monthly Notices, 64, page 748. It exhibits the mean daily spotted
THE SUN AND SUNSPOTS—MAUNDER 161

area of the sun; the total mean spotted area of the northern
hemisphere being shown separately from that of the southern.
The principal feature of the diagram therefore is the comparison of
the sun-spot areas in the two hemispheres. From this point of
view the diagram is worth careful consideration. Just as the first
illustration showed that during the years represented there was only
one sun-spot cycle—a cycle having a mean duration of about 1114
years—so the present diagram shows that the cycle holds good for
each hemisphere, as well as for both together. The solar cycle is one.
There is no question of the existence of submultiple cycles, or of
incommensurable cycles of greater length.

Further examination of the diagram shows that the maximum
activity in any particular cycle does not necessarily fall at the same
epoch for the two hemispheres; rather, a divergency appears between
them. In each of the four cycles represented, the northern activity
was developed before the southern; in each of them the curve in one
hemisphere attained a single crest, while in the other it attained a
double one; or, to put it in other words, the form of the curve was
not the same in the two hemispheres. We have therefore here a
solar dichotomy displayed. Had the results of the whole century
been presented in a like form, other peculiarities would have been
seen, but these would have strengthened, not weakened, the case
for the solar dichotomy. The solar cycle is one; its manifestations
in the two hemispheres, north and south, are different.
162 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

The third diagram (fig. 8) is an extension of that appearing in
the Monthly Notices, 74, Plate 3, between pages 114 and 115, and
brings out another relation. The solar dichotomy is not illustrated
here; we are dealing with the whole of the sun’s disk as we see it.
The points set forth are the variations in the area covered by sun-
spots, and the variations in the mean distance from the equator of
the sun of all spots. Area and latitude are the two factors brought
into notice. The period covered by the diagram is 1854-1923. The
statistics for the first two cycles are derived from the work of the
late Professor Spoerer; for the last four, from the Greenwich
Photoheliographic Results.

The continuous line shows the variation in the total daily spotted
area of the sun during the progress of each cycle; the dotted line

shows the changing distance from the solar equator of the center of
gravity of the sun-spot zones. In this latter curve, we have the
fact that the solar cycle is one, and one only, brought out in a most
unmistakable fashion; each cycle begins with an activity in high
latitude ; each cycle ends with the last remnants of activity transferred
to a low one; but, as the new cycle begins before the old cycle has
completed its course, the two overlap for a short time. This is what
is known as “Spoerer’s law of zones.” Broadly speaking, we may
say that the approach toward the equator is continuous from the
beginning of the cycle to its end. The distinction between the forms
of the two curves is emphatic. The area curve is continuous; it
begins practically at zero; it increases up to a certain point; it then
diminishes again to the next zero; and soon. Flow and ebb, flow and
ebb, follow each other continuously. But the latitude curve is dis-
THE SUN AND SUNSPOTS—MAUNDER 163

continuous. It always starts from high latitude; when it has reached
low latitudes it is cut off; there is no gradual return to the high
latitudes. The reappearance of spots in high latitudes is sudden.

There are now three facts before us. There is one solar cycie,
shown differently, in time and form of the curve, in the two hemi-
spheres, and now in two manifestations of quite separate character ;
one in area, a complete pulsation, and one in latitude, which moves
in one direction only; i. e., from high solar latitudes to low.

The fourth illustration (fig. 4) appeared in the Monthly Notices,
74, Plate 2, between pages 114 and 115. It deals only with the
distribution of spots in latitude, nothing being shown concerning the
areas of spots. The materials are drawn entirely from the Green-
wich Photoheliographic Results, and extend over the years 1874-1913.
Seven thousand spots are represented, but the short straight line
which indicates the latitude of a spot is drawn just as long and
as heavy for a small spot as for a large one; for one spot as for a
dozen. All spots occurring during the same rotation of the sun are
represented in the same vertical line. The diagram is concerned
only with the distribution of spot centers in heliographic latitude.

This diagram has been familiarly called “the butterfly diagram,”
as it seems to suggest three butterflies pinned down to a board with
their wings extended. Heads, bodies, and legs have disappeared,
but the outstretched wings remain. Each pair of wings is distinct
from the next; there is a clear V-shaped gap between each of the
three specimens. Here again the first deduction is reinforced from
an altogether different set of facts. The solar cycle is one.

This diagram further suggests that the origin of the solar spots
lies within the sun, not without. They come from below the sur-
face; they are not impressed upon the surface by some exterior
influence; neither by planets nor by meteors. No exterior influence
could invariably begin a fresh disturbance in a high latitude simul-
taneously on both sides of the Equator.

If we take a card with a narrow slit in it, parallel to the sun’s
equator, and move it up and down over the diagram, then, wherever
that slit is placed within the range of the sun-spot zones, the three
sun-spot cycles will be brought out clearly and unmistakably. Our
first conclusion, that the sun-spot cycle is one, is now extended; it is
true not merely for sunspots in general, but for the spots of any
special zone in particular. This conclusion goes deeper than our first,
which was merely that the sun-spot cycle, on the average, lasted for
about 1114 years. The sun as a whole is under the law of that cycle,
and edth individual zone has its own particular part to play in it.
But the sun as a whole is a unit, no matter how distinct its dichotomy
into two hemispheres, no matter how distinct may be the action in
any particular zone.

THE SUN AND SUNSPOTS—MAUNDER 165

Another feature is suggested by this diagram, but will be better
brought out in a different connection. It is that the southern hemi-
sphere appears to encroach slightly on the northern at the equator,
or at about the time of the close of one cycle and the beginning of the
next. The southern influence seems to cross the equator.

Since the origin of the solar spots les within the sun, and the
northern and southern spots show differences in their behavior, we
must conclude that the sun is not symmetrical in the constitution of
its interior. If then we assume, as the basis of any investigation,
that the sun is symmetrical in its internal constitution, we are making
an assumption contrary te the evidence supplied by the behavior of
1ts surface.

If there be this clear distinction between the two hemispheres, is it
possible that one of them might go out of action for a time, and if so,
what would follow?

This is not a mere oratorical question; the event supposed has
actually occurred. Dr. Rudolf Wolf, of Zurich, demonstrated, and
Spoerer developed that demonstration further, that in the latter part
of the seventeenth century and the beginning of the eighteenth the
northern hemisphere of the sun failed for many years to produce a
single recorded spot.

Was there any effect during that same period recognized here on
the earth that could be plausibly associated with this failure in spot
production in the sun’s northern hemisphere?

It is suggestive that, while the northern hemisphere was thus en-
tirely barren, the southern hemisphere of the sun had some spots, but
only few, and for nearly 70 years the sun showed a prolonged spot
minimum. ‘The failure in spot activity of the northern hemisphere
was not compensated by an increased activity in the southern.
Further, as Miss Agnes Clerke pointed out in Knowledge for Sep-
tember, 1894, no aurore were reported during these years; from
which we may infer that there were no great magnetic disturbances
taking place on the earth. It is also suggestive that Prof. A. E.
Douglass, who has been studying with great particularity the annual
rings of trees in relation to climate and the solar activity (Climatic
Cycles and Tree Growths), found that this same period “ was the
interval in the yellow pines” (i. e. of northern Arizona) “ which
gave me more trouble than any other in trying to work out the action
of the sun-spot cycle” (Journal of the British Astronomical Asso-
ciation, 32, 223). Professor Douglass added that it seemed to him
“a very important corroboration of the relationship between solar
activity and terrestrial conditions, for I presume that these tree
variations are related directly to the weather.”
166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Sunspots, if looked at casually, appear to differ widely in their
form and behavior, but a little systematic observation shows that, for
the most part, they conform in their history to a single type. As an
illustration we may take the group which attained its maximum de-
velopment in March, 1920, and of which the Rev. A. L. Cortie has
summarized the life history in the Monthly Notices, 80, 574-578,
where it is accompanied by seven drawings of its appearance. This
type is that of a more or less regular stream, of which the first and
last spots are usually the largest, best defined, and the most stable.
The straight line joiming the two chief spots—sometimes distin-
guished as the “leader” and “ trailer ”—was in this case parallel to
the sun’s equator.

Professor Hale has shown that all spots contain magnetic fields,
and that the strength of this field (up to a certain maximum) in-
creases with the diameter of the spot; and that the polarities in any
one cycle follow a definite law with respect to the position of the
spot on the sun according as it is north or south of the equator. If
the sign of the dominant charge remains always the same, then
opposite polarities may be regarded as representing opposite direc-
tions of whirl. Now in streams in which the “leader” and the
“trailer” are dominant, Professor Hale has pointed out that these
two are of opposite polarities; that is, of opposite directions of
whirl. Where, then, we have two “ bipolar ” streams, one north and
one south of the solar equator, we find that the two leaders have
whirls in directions opposite to each other, and, similarly, the two
“trailers” have whirls opposite. Further, during the cycle ending
in 1918, the leader spots in the northern and the trailer spots in the
southern hemisphere were of negative polarity; the sign of the
polarity being positive for the southern leaders and northern trailers.
But during the cycle after 1914, these relative whirls were inter-
changed, the northern leaders and southern trailers becoming positive
and the southern leaders and northern trailers negative, until June
24, 1922, when a small single spot (probably a leading spot whose
trailer had become invisible) in north latitude 31°, was found to have
south or negative polarity. This was the first indication that the
new cycle just beginning was again experiencing a general reversal
of polarities.

Thus during the minimum years of 1913-14 and of 1922-24, we
have not only the high latitude spots of the new cycle overlapping the
low latitude spots of the old, but also four spot zones, characterized
by distinct magnetic polarities coexisting together. But the general
magnetic field of the sun shows no reversal of polarity.

Professor Hale also points out (Contributions from Mount Wilson
Solar Observatory, No. 165) that the inclination of the axis of the
spot stream, which is in general represented by the line joining the
THE SUN AND SUNSPOTS—MAUNDER 167

“leader” and the “trailer,” bears a definite relation to the latitude
at which it occurs. The “trailer” tends to be further from the
equator than the “leader,” and “in low latitudes the axes are nearly
parallel to the sun’s equator; but with increasing latitude the mean
inclination increases to a maximum of about 11°” in the region of
latitude 30° to 35°.

To go back in the history nearly 60 years, one of the most notable
contributions to the answer to the question “ What is a sun?” was
supplied by the Redhill Observations of Sunspots made by R. C.

Carrington in the years 1853-1861, in which he redetermined the posi-
tion of the sun’s axis and the rotation period of the sun. In par-
ticular, he showed that each different zone of latitude, north and
south, has its own rotation period. The annexed diagram (fig. 5)
will roughly illustrate the general effect. It is drawn on the assump-
tion that there is a spot in every fifth degree of latitude, and that at
a given moment these 17 spots were all observed to be on the central
meridian of the sun’s apparent disk. If, then, each spot traveled
westward with the average speed of apparent motion appropriate to
its own particular latitude, then in 27% days the spots would be
found in the positions indicated on the curved line.
168 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

lieferring again to “the butterfly diagram,” the shift of the
habitat of spot groups during the progress of the solar cycle shown
therein would appear to be a sort of surface ripple on the sun, mov-
ing in both hemispheres from high latitudes to low, as each cycle
proceeds from its beginning to its close. The case of the Cepheid
variables has made us familiar in recent years with the idea of stars
which change their volume—stars with pulsating photospheres. In
the sun we have, as yet, no proof of a general pulsation of the photo-
sphere; only of this ripple of disturbance on its surface. But, since
the rotation period, as indicated by sunspots, is shorter as the
equator is approached, it follows that the mean rotation period of the
sun is quicker before minimum than after.

But the above diagram puts the fact of the difference in the rota-
tion periods of different latitudes in much too crude a form. A
paper on “ The solar rotation period from Greenwich sun-spot meas-
ures, 1879-1901,” appeared in the Monthly Notices, 65, and on page
817 a table was given (Table IL) which was intended to show how
wide are the differences of rotation period, as derived from different
spot groups even in the same latitude. Every group has a proper
motion of its own; even within the same group there are internal
movements. The leader spot in the early days of a group tends to
rush forward over the surface; in the group’s later history to slacken
speed and return on its track.? Also the groups which live the
longest, returning two or more times to the visible hemisphere of the
sun, move more slowly on the whole than short-lived spots, and yield
different rotation periods during their successive apparitions.

One remarkable peculiarity is common to both the cycles, 1879-
1891 and 1891-1901, and since it was brought out by Carrington’s
inquiry two cycles earlier it is probable that it expresses a real pecu-
liarity of the solar rotation. In spite of the great irregularity in
the rotation periods given by the spots in any particular zone, there
does appear to be a distinct tendency for the shortest mean period to
be given, not at the equator, but slightly to the north of it. The curve
given by the different rotation periods is not precisely symmetrical
with respect to the equator, and, on the whole, there appears to be a
tendency for the periods in the northern latitudes to lengthen more
rapidly with distance from the equator than with those of the southern.
A similar feature was suggested in “ the butterfly diagram,” wherein
the southern hemisphere appeared to encroach slightly on the northern
at the equator. The equator of rotation would appear not to coincide
with the equator of figure, but to lie slightly to the north of it.*

difference of its observed rate of motion from the general surface
drift.

The seventh diagram is drawn upon precisely the same scale as
figure 6, and shows the distribution of certain solar longitudes. But
these are not longitudes of spots on the sun, but of the center of the
sun’s disk at the moment when a magnetic storm began to be felt upon
the earth. In this case every magnetic storm is recorded. It will be
seen how similar is the character of the associated dots in the two
figures; even though no spots are given in figure 6 that made only
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

one appearance. If the single appearances in figure 7 had been
omitted, the resemblance between the two diagrams would have been
much increased. In other words, the intervals between the successive
returns of a group of spots to the center of the sun’s disk, as seen
from the earth, are strictly comparable with the intervals between
the recurrences of a magnetic storm. Magnetic storms obey the law
of the sun’s rotation.

This could not be so if the influence that brings about our magnetic
storms proceeded equally from every part of the solar surface and
was radiated from it equally in all directions. It follows that mag-
netic storms are brought about by an influence which arises from
restricted areas of the sun’s surface, and is discharged from such areas
in restricted directions. Thus Mr. Gavin Burns has tabulated his
records of aurorz (Memoirs of the British Astronomical Association,
23, Part I., “ Report of the section for the observation of aurore
and the zodiacal light, 1916-1919”) in recent years in accordance
THE SUN AND SUNSPOTS—MAUNDER 171

with the solar rotation, and the tables show at a glance that the
greatest displays synchronized with the return of certain special
meridians to the center of the sun’s disk; other meridians on the sun
appear to leave our atmosphere quite undisturbed. The sun is struc-
tured, not only as between the northern and southern hemispheres,
and as between different latitudes, but—as regards its emanations—
as between some of its longitudes also.

There are such influences proceeding from the sun, and the outer
corona is built up in obedience to them. This has been clearly seen in
the photographs which have been secured of the corona on many
occasions; as, for example, in the eclipse of December 12, 1871, photo-
graphed at Baikul by Lord Lindsay’s assistant, Mr. Davis, and shown
in the Memoirs of the R. A. S., 41, Plates 7 and 8. The chief feature
of the corona of this eclipse was the massing of its greater portion
into petal-shaped formations, which were called at that time “syn-
clinal groups.” In Plate 7 the synclinal group in the south-southeast
rises above a bright semicircular arc, and much fainter arches can be
discerned rising above the lowest one. Above the highest of these
the sides of the structure curve as if to meet; in Plate 8 they very
nearly meet. Several similar synclinal groups were yet more distinctly
shown.in the photographs obtained by Sir W. H. M. Christie in the
eclipse of 1898 at Sahdol in India, and again in the eclipse of 1901, by
the members of the British expeditions to Sumatra and Mauritius.

But it was in the eclipse of 1898 that the structure of the outermost
corona was photographed; and the synclinal groups, so beautifully
shown on Sir W. H. M. Christie’s negatives, were seen on photographs
taken at Talni, with a Dallmeyer astigmatic lens of 114 inches aper-
ture and 9 inches focus, to terminate in long narrow straight beams,
the apex of the highest arch in each of the groups being, as it were,
blown out, and driven away in a straight line into space. The longest
beam was traced for at least 6,000,000 miles.‘ -

From photographs taken in these and other eclipses, it would ap-
pear that over certain disturbed areas of the solar surface leaf-shaped
structures are built up, from the apices of which matter seems to be
driven away in long straight rod-like beams. Such beams, driven
forth into space and continually replenished from beneath, would, if
in the right direction, from time to time overtake the earth in its orbit,
and strike it on the sunset arc. Remembering that in a hot gaseous
body like the sun, electrified particles, both positively and negatively
charged, must occur in great numbers, we can understand how the
same disturbed area may be fed with particles of different sign, which,
by their mutual attraction, give rise to the rod-like beams that issue
from it. These cross the space that separates the earth from the sun,
and reveal their arrival here by means of magnetic storms and aurore.

Thus it is evident that the disturbed state of the sun’s surface
affects the earth. But there is also some evidence that the earth ap-
pears to affect the sun’s surface. This appears in a slight, but dis-
tinct, dissymmetry between the eastern and western halves of the
apparent disk of the sun, with respect to three orders of solar phe-
nomena: the numbers of prominences; the areas of facule; and the
numbers and areas of spot groups. There is some evidence that the
amount and the sign of this dissymmetry vary in the course of the
solar cycle. A complete explanation is still to seek.®

These conclusions and suggestions have been derived, during the
century of the history of this Society, from observations of the
changes, real and apparent, of the areas of sunspots and of their
distributions in longitude and latitude.

APPENDIX °

In the two years since the writing of the original paper, several
expressions for the rotation period of the sun, varying with the
latitude, have been found for facule and flocculi, phenomena which
differ in character from sunspots and from each other. Comparing
the zones, 5° in breadth, of greatest activity (those with their cen-
ters at 1214° on either side of the Equator) for five of these investi-
gations, we have the following result:

It will be seen that the extreme difference from the mean is only
0.12 of a day.

But these are all mean values for the zone; the scattering shown by
the individual objects in any zone is as marked and significant as
is the crowding round the mean rotation period in that zone. For
example, for spots observed from 6 to 14 days the most active zones
have synodic periods ranging from 2334 to 3090 and facule and floc-
culi both show a scattering of about the same order.

This fact has a bearing on the rotation periods of the sun given
by magnetic storms. It implies that it is not possible to determine
with any degree of certainty the particular zone of solar latitude,
from whence a pair of magnetic storms have arisen, merely by notic-
ing the interval in time that has occurred between them. Thus
Table II gives for 190 pairs of storms occurring between 1848 and
1918, and for spots from 1879 to 1901, the degrees of favor shown
for the various synodic periods.

It is evident that both spots and magnetic storms concentrate
sharply upon a synodic period of 27.1 days.

The representations of the corona, shown in Plates 1-7, are draw-.
ings made from photographs taken by Mrs. Maunder in 1898 in
India, and in 1901 in Mauritius. A drawing of the former was
made by the late Mr. W. H. Wesley; the drawings from the Mauritius
eclipse were made by Miss Beatrice Handler. In the latter it will be
seen that there are two leaflike formations, each covering a very
disturbed are of about 60°. In the complete corona of longer ex-
posure, the apex of each leaf is shown, but while that of the more .
northern is prolonged radially out into a beam, the apex of the more
southern is directed somewhat toward the equator, so that the beam
as a whole is inclined to the normal. In the small-scale photo-
graph, that taken in India in 1898, we see one of the beams pro-
longed into a straight rodlike ray; straight to as great a distance
as it can be distinguished upon the photograph. A recent paper by
Mr. E. A. Milne on “The average life of an excited calcium atom ”
(Monthly Notices, 84, March, 1924) gives some idea of the way
in which such rays arise in the disturbed sun-spot zones and how
their particles escape outward from the sun.
174 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Lately, Doctor Abbot has shown that these rodlike rays, which
are streams of particles, restricted as to the areas from whence they
arise, and in the directions in which they are emitted, affect another
planet of the solar system. In the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences for October, 1923, Doctor Abbot points out
that “when sunspots transit across the central diameter of the
visible disk, lower radiation values occur, and usually reach a
minimum on the day following the transit,” and to explain this,
quotes the observations of Guthnick on the brightness of Saturn,
which indicated certain small fluctuations. These fluctuations
agreed in percentage with the variations of the solar constant, pro-
vided a time allowance was made to take account of the rotation of
the sun from a position facing the earth to one facing Saturn. “It
seemed, in short, as if rays of a certain intensity of radiation, going
out from the sun, rotated along with it, and so affected the dif-
ferent planets in the order of their heliographic longitudes.” He
finds such ragged, unequal rays in the solar corona, and it is evident
that this lower radiation, about a day after a spot transit over the
central meridian, and a magnetic storm are both due—directly or
indirectly—to the same rays, for in the cases of the magnetic storms,
which accompanied the spots 9127 and 9143 (of the Greenwich
series) in February and March, 1920, the lower solar constant in each
case occurred about the time of greatest height of the magnetic storm.
The latter is due to the disturbance of the earth’s magnetism by
the solar ray; the lower solar constant is attributed by Doctor
Abbot, to the diminished transparency of the enveloping ray itself.

We therefore now recognize two distinct methods of radiation
from the sun; the first, general, from the entire surface and in all
directions; the second, special, arising from certain districts in
certain zones, and emitted in restricted directions only.

Indications of variations in the general radiation have been found
by Doctor Abbot by higher values of the solar constant here on
earth, when sunspots form, or are increasing, or are brought by
the solar rotation into view at the east limb of the sun, and when-
ever the solar surface is shown by the Ha spectroheliograms to be
much disturbed. ‘“ When a period of quiescence in solar activity
occurs, the radiation values tend to fall continually until some new
outbreak of activity is observed.” An agreement has also been es-
tablished between the rate of the melting of the white polar caps
of Mars and the progress of the solar cycle. Thus, in 1916
(Monthly Notices, 76, No. 8), E. M. Antoniadi recorded that “ out
of 21 cases of observed melting of the caps between 1862 and 1914,
inclusive, there are four more or less unfavorable and seventeen fa-
vorable to the agreement in question.”
