OF THE
SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION
CuarLes D. WALcoTT

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1923

Z'o the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith the customary
annual report showing the activities and condition of the Smith-
sonian Institution and its branches during the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1923. The first 26 pages of the report contain an account
of the affairs of the Institution proper, with brief abstracts of the
work carried on by the various branches of the Institution, while
Appendixes 1 to 10 give more detailed reports of the operations of
the United States National Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the
Freer Gallery of Art, the Bureau of American Ethnology, the
International Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, the
Astrophysical Observatory, the United States Regional Bureau of
the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature, the Smith-
gonian Library, and of the publications of the Institution and its
branches.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

THE ESTABLISHMENT

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of Eng-
land, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States of
America “to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accepting
the trust Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and therefore
constituted an “ establishment ” whose statutory members are “ the
President, the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of

the executive departments.”

2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

THE BOARD OF REGENTS

The affairs of the Institution are administered by a Board of
Regents whose membership consists of “ the Vice President, the Chief
Justice, three Members of the Senate, and three Members of the
House of Representatives, together with six other persons other than
Members of Congress, two of whom shall be resident in the City
of Washington and the other four shall be inhabitants of some State,
but no two of them of the same State.” One of the Regents is
elected chancellor by the board; in the past the selection has fallen
upon the Vice President or the Chief Justice; and a suitable person
is chosen by them as secretary of the Institution, who is also secre-
tary of the Board of Regents and the executive officer directly in
charge of the Institution’s activities.

In regard to the personnel of the board, the following changes
occurred during the year: Robert Walton Moore, Member of the
House of Representatives from Virginia, was appointed a Regent
by the Speaker of the House, to succeed the late Lemuel P. Padgett.
Mr. Henry White was reappointed by joint resolution of Congress,
Mr. Irwin B. Laughlin, of Pennsylvania, was appointed to succeed
the late Dr. A. Graham Bell, and Mr. Frederic A. Delano, of the
District of Columbia, to succeed Mr. John B. Henderson, who died
during the year. The election of Representative Frank L. Greene
to the Senate on March 4, 1923, automatically terminated his term
as a Regent.

The roll of Regents at the close of the fiscal year was as follows:
Calvin Coolidge, Vice President of the United States, Chancellor;
William H. Taft, Chief Justice of the United States; Henry Cabot
Lodge, Member of the Senate; A. Owsley Stanley, Member of the
Senate; Medill McCormick, Member of the Senate; Albert Johnson,
Member of the House of Representatives; R. Walton Moore, Member
of the House of Representatives; George Gray, citizen of Delaware;
Charles F. Choate, jr., citizen of Massachusetts; Henry White, citi-
zen of Washington, D. C.; Robert S. Brookings, citizen of Missouri;
Irwin B. Laughlin, citizen of Pennsylvania; and Frederic A. Delano,
citizen of the District of Columbia.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS

A systematic campaign was begun during the year to increase the
endowment of the Institution to more adequate preportions though
at the close of the year this has had no material success. It is felt
that there is considerable misunderstanding throughout the country
regarding the resources of the Smithsonian Institution, many per-
sons believing that it is supported, at least to some extent, by the
Government. As a matter of fact, though the Congress appropriates
funds annually for the maintenance of the various bureaus which
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 3

have grown up around the Institution and are administered by it, not
one cent from these appropriations can be used by the Institution
proper for the purpose for which “ pes created, “ the i mnerease and
diffusion of knowledge among men.’

These purposes, which are carried out through research, explora-
tion, and publication, must be supported by the funds of the Institu-
tion itself or by money contributed for special purposes by the friends
of the Institution. As the endowed funds of the Institution, con-
sisting of the original bequest to the Nation of James Smithson
and subsequent gifts and bequests, amount to only a little over a mil-
lion dollars, yielding an available annual income of approximately
$60,000 from which the administrative costs of the Institution and of
the general direction of its seven branches must be paid, it will be
readily apparent that but little remains each year for research and
exploration. It is believed that if the financial situation of the
Smithsonian Institution and its excellent position for carrying on
needed scientific work were more fully understood, there would be
ready response to its plea for a larger endowment, and its program
of scientific research and exploration could then be expanded and
pushed vigorously, to the ultimate benefit of mankind.

An outstanding event of the year was the formal opening on May
2, 1923, of the Freer Gallery of Art, the culmination of Mr. Charles
L. Freer’s splendid gift to the Nation, through the Smithsonian In-
stitution, of his unrivalled collections of American and Oriental art
and a beautiful building to house them. The opening was well
attended and was the cause of favorable comment in art circles
throughout the country, many of the leading art journals carrying
full accounts of the gallery and its contents. The building is now
open to the public daily except Mondays.

FINANCES

RESEARCHES AND EXPLORATIONS

In the Institution’s work in the “ increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge,” scientific exploration and research expeditions in the field play
an important part. There has been even more than the usual activity
in this phase of the work during the past year, the Institution and
its branches having initiated or taken part in 22 separate expeditions
in widely scattered parts of the earth, representing many branches
of science. The very limited funds of the Institution available for
this important work make it necessary each year to forego oppor-
tunities to send out or join forces with other scientific organizations
in expeditions which would result in valuable information and ma-
terial for study and exhibition to the public in the National Museum.
I will mention here only a few of the expeditions in the field during
the past year, in order to show the nature and scope of the work,
referring to the appended reports on the National Museum, Bureau
of American Ethnology, and other branches of the Institution for
accounts of the explorations undertaken by them.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY t
GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS IN THE CANADIAN ROCKIES

My geological field work in the Canadian Rocky Mountains, de-
seribed in previous reports, was continued during the past year,
special attention being given to securing evidence bearing on the
pre-Devonian formations north of the Bow Valley, Alberta, and
south along the new Banff-Windermere motor road. Difficulties were
encountered during the first part of the season, owing to dense
forest-fire smoke and unsatisfactory trail men, but during August
and September conditions were greatly improved and the work was
pushed vigorously.

A fine section of pre-Devonian strata was studied and measured
in the upper part of Douglas Lake Canyon Valley, and many pho-
tographs were secured. The measured geologic section was from the
base of the Devonian, above Lake Gwendolyn, across the canyon to
the deep cirque below Halstead Pass, where the great Lyell lime-
stone forms the crest of the ridge. The section includes the Ozarkian
Mons formation down to the Lyell formation of the upper Cambrian.

Going south from the Bow Valley, camp was next made on the
Kootenay River, about 6 miles below the mouth of the Vermilion
River. The Kootenay Valley is broad and deep, with the high
ridges of the Mitchell Range on the east and the Brisco Range on
the west. The limestones and shales of both ranges are upturned and
sheared and faulted, making it very difficult to work out the structure
and the complete stratigraphic succession of the various formations.
The Silurian limestones, with their fossil coral beds above the white
quartzite of the Richmond transgression, were found in the upper
portion of Sinclair Canyon, and not far away black shales full of
Silurian graptolites. Lower down the canyon thin-bedded gray
limestone yielded fossils of the Mons formation.

It is evident that in the ancient and narrow Cordilleran Sea, that
extended from the Arctic Ocean 2,000 miles (3,218 km.) or more
south, between the coast ranges of the time and the uplands of the
central portion of the North American continent, there was a sim-
ilarity of Lower Paleozoic marine life along the shores and its shal-
low waters. Evidences of this and of strong currents and persistent
wave action occur all the way from central Nevada to Mount Robson,
in British Columbia. The record of the marine life and deposits
of mud and sand is most complete.

PALEONTOLOGICAL FIELD WORK IN TENNESSEE

Dr. R. S. Bassler, curator, division of paleontology of the United
States National Museum, spent six weeks in June and July in a con-
tinuation of stratigraphic and paleontologic studies begun a year
before in the central basin of Tennessee, in collaboration with the
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Tennessee State survey. In 1921 the study and mapping of the
Franklin quadrangle, an area of about 250 square miles just south
of Nashville, was well advanced, and this year it was brought to com-
pletion and data secured for the preparation of a geological report
upon the area, to be published by the State. Stratigraphic studies
were then undertaken in contiguous areas, in which Doctor Bassler
was joined by Doctors Ulrich and Mesler. The classic section at
Nashville, in which the proper delimitation of the formations has
long been in dispute, was studied with especial care, and large col-
lections of fossils were secured to verify the stratigraphic results.

Regarding this section, Doctor Bassler says:

The deep-sea origin of all limestones has long been taught in spite of the
trend of evidence that many limestone formations were laid down in shallow
seas. The shallow-water origin of limestone is well illustrated in the sec-
tion of Ordovician strata exposed near the blind asylum at Nashville, which
has been studied by several generations of geologists. At the base of this
section is the Hermitage formation, which was evidently formed along ancient
shore lines because it is composed of beach-worn fragments of shells and other
fossils. Above this comes the Bigby limestone, the source of much of the
Tennessee brown phosphate, and which also is made up almost entirely of the
comminuted remains of fossils. Next is the Dove limestone, an almost pure,
dove-colored, lithographic-like limestone which shows its shallow-water origin
in the worm tubes penetrating it and its sun-cracked upper surface. A slab
of this limestone a foot thick, now on exhibition in the National Museum,
well illustrates the polygonal upper surface and the penetrating worm tubes,
both features indicative of the origin of the rock on old mud flats which were
periodically above water and thus became sun cracked. The succeeding Ward
limestone is of the more typical blue variety, but here the rock is filled with
millions of fossil shells which, under the influence of weathering, are changed
to silica and are left free in great numbers in the soil. This section is only
a portion of the entire geological sequence at Nashville, but it well illustrates
the various types of limestone outcropping throughout the central basin.

EXPEDITION TO EXAMINE THE NORTH PACIFIC FUR SEAL ISLANDS

Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, head curator of biology in the United
States National Museum, was detailed at the request of the Depart-
ment of Commerce, to accompany an expedition to Alaska and
adjacent regions during the summer of 1922 to ascertain the status
of the fur seal herds in the North Pacific Ocean since their protection
through the treaty of 1911 between the United States, Russia, Japan,
and Great Britain. The first seal rookeries visited were those of the
Pribilofs, where the increase in number of seals on the beaches is
very remarkable, and Doctor Stejneger predicts a complete resti-
tution of the fur seal herd to its former maximum for the not dis-
tant future. A new method of stripping the skin from the dead seal
and subsequent cleaning of the skin was being adopted on an ex-
tensive scale and was found to be a great improvement over the old
method.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 9

On Bering Island of the Commander Islands, the next stop of the
expedition, conditions were quite the reverse of those on the Pribi-
lofs. The south rookery had long since ceased to exist and the great
north rookery had been greatly reduced. On his last visit to this
rookery in 1879, Stejneger had estimated the number of breeding
seals there at 30,000. At the time of the present visit, there were
scarcely 2,000 left.

The expedition next visited the Japanese fur seal island usually
known as Robben Island in the Okhotsk Sea. Here the number of
fur seals has gradually increased until now they occupy not only the
entire eastern beach but are extending the rookery at both ends on
to the west side of the island. The Japanese have followed closely
the methods employed in managing the American seal herd on the
Pribilofs, and the result is most instructive in showing conclusively
that “protection does protect.” Important information regarding
the Russian fur seal islands was obtained from Mr. Koltanovski and
Colonel Sokolnikof, and from Yokohama Doctor Stejneger took
passage back to the United States, having completed the inspection
of the fur seal rookeries.

BOTANICAL EXPLORATION IN COLOMBIA

From April to October, 1922, Dr. Francis W. Pennell, of the Phil-
adelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, and Mr. Ellsworth P. Killip,
of the National Museum, carried on botanical exploration in the
Republic of Colombia. The expedition was organized by several
institutions as part of a general plan for the botanical study of
northern South America. Financial assistance was also given by
Mr. Oakes Ames, who was especially interested in the orchids of the
region.

Entering the country at Buenaventura on the Pacific side, the
expedition established headquarters at La Cumbre in the Western
Cordillera, for the purpose of studying the vegetation of the central
part of this range. Descending to the city of Cali, the party pro-
ceeded up the Cauca Valley to Popayan, and from this point explored
the southern portions of both the central and western Cordilleras.
Later the expedition visited Salento, in the northern part of the Cen-
tral Range, and Ibagué and Bogota, collecting material at historic
localities along the Quindiu Trail. Approximately 7,200 members
were collected, sufficient material being secured to make up equal
sets for each of the institutions represented in the expedition.

In his report on the work, Mr. Killip says:

As might be expected from its physiography, the vegetation of Colombia is
extremely diverse. Within a few miles may occur a luxuriant tropical flora,
the more open woods of the temperate zone, and the low alpine growth familiar

on our American mountain tops. Again, as in the Dagua Valley, one may ride
through a dense rain forest, filled with ferns, mosses, and aroids, to emerge
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

suddenly in an arid desert-like region, where cacti and acacias are the con-
spicuous plants. -

So inadequately known is the flora of Colombia that even along the regular
routes of travel many species are found that are either new, unrepresented in
American herbaria, or known only from specimens preserved in European
collections.

The botanical collection resulting from this expedition is one of
the largest and most important ever obtained in Colombia.

EXPLORATION OF THE PALEOLITHIC REGIONS OF FRANCE AND SPAIN

During September, 1922, Mr. M. W. Stirling, of the National
Museum, explored the paleolithic regions of southern France and
northern Spain. Besides visiting all of the important sites where
remains of ancient man have been discovered, the expedition entered —
a great many caves previously unknown to science. Regarding the
great promise of the region for archeological work, Mr. Stirling
reports as follows:

The idea has become prevalent in America that this region has been practi-
cally exhausted archeologically. Although the previous existence of paleo-
lithic man in this locality has been known for half a century, it may be truly
said that the work of exploration has hardly begun.

The habitations of the Stone Age are closely linked with the limestone forma-
tion which overlies large areas in this part of Europe. These may be said to
fall into two classes, i. e., rock shelters and caverns. The former are under-
cuts in the limestone made by the rivers in the early Pleistocene or late Plio-
cene. A general elevation of the land has caused the streams to*deepen their
channels, thus leaving the undercuts well above the surface of the water.
These were utilized as dwelling places by paleolithic man and in many instances
were artificially modified. There are literally miles of relic-bearing deposits
of this class that have not yet been touched. The possibilities in this field are
very great.

The caverns of the Dordogne region are for the most part comparatively
small, while those in the department of Arriege are immense caves of a most
spectacular nature. Of the former class are the grottoes of Font du Gaume,
Combarelles, La Mouthe, Marsoulas, Montesquieu, and others. Of the latter
class are the immense caves in the neighborhood of Foix, as for example, Salig-
nac, Ussat, and Niaux. The tunnel of Mas d’Azil is the remnant of such a cave.

Many of these caverns have become blocked with sediment owing to the fact
that they frequently slope downward from the entrance. Messrs. Stirling and
Patton entered at least a dozen such caves which had become sealed at varying
distances from their mouths. The opening of such caves has heretofore been
left entirely to chance. Scientific endeavor at this work should produce most
fruitful results. The sealing of these caves has been a fortunate accident of
nature, since the contents are by this means preserved intact.

Of the regions visited, that in the neighborhood of Altamira, in Spain, and
Ussat, in France, give most promise of rich returns to the archeologist.

CENTENARY OF THE BIRTH OF SPENCER FULLERTON BAIRD

A meeting was held in the auditorium of the National Museum
on the evening of February 3, 1923, to celebrate the centenary of the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY lal

birth of Spencer Fullerton Baird, second secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution, the virtual founder of the United States National
Museum, the creator and head of the United States Fish Commis-
sion, and a prime mover in the establishment of the United States
Geological Survey and the Bureau of American Ethnology. The
meeting was presided over by Representative Frank L. Greene, a
member of the Board of Regents of the Institution, and the following
addresses were delivered: “ Baird, the man,” by Dr. William Healey
Dall; “Baird and the Smithsonian Institution and its branches,”
by Dr. Charles G. Abbot; “ Baird at Woods Hole,” by Prof. Edwin
Linton; “ Baird and the Fisheries,” by Prof. David Starr Jordan;
and “ Baird, the Naturalist,” by Dr. C. Hart Merriam.

In the afternoon, preceding the formal celebration, the National
Baird Memorial Committee met in the National Museum to decide
upon the form of the memorial or memorials to Baird. The com-
mittee was composed of delegates appointed by 54 scientific societies
and institutions from various parts of the country, with the follow-
ing officers:

Honorary president, Dr. William H. Dall; president, Dr. Charles
D. Walcott; vice presidents, Mr. George R. Agassiz, Dr. Alexander
Graham Bell (deceased), Prof. Frank W. Clarke, Prof. Stephen
A. Forbes; Prof. David Starr Jordan, Prof. Edwin Linton, Prof.
Edward S. Morse, Prof. Henry Fairfield Osborn, Prof. Addison
KE. Verrill, and Dr. Robert S. Woodward; secretary, Dr. Paul
Bartsch. At this afternoon meeting it was announced that appro-
priate exercises were held during the morning, when wreaths were
placed on the grave of Baird in Oak Hill Cemetery, the bust of
Baird in the American Museum of Natural History, the Baird
memorial bowlder of the American Fisheries Society at Woods
Hole, and the Baird memorial tablet at the Bureau of Fisheries
Building in Washington, and that the mayor of Reading, Pa., had
been requested to decorate the house in which Baird was born.

The report of the national committee, announced at the evening
meeting, is as follows:

1. That Congress be memorialized to establish in the city of
Washington a museum of fisheries and oceanography, with labora-
tories and a public aquarium, as a memorial to Spencer Fullerton
Baird.

9. That there be established a fund for the encouragement of
research and exploration in the directions in which Spencer Fuller-
ton Baird was a leader.

3. It was the sense of the meeting that the name of Baird be given
- to the laboratory of the Bureau of Fisheries at Woods Hole, Mass.
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923
PRESENTATION OF BUST OF JEANNE D’ARC

On February 23, 1923, there was presented to the Smithsonian
Institution for the American people a bronze bust of Jeanne d’Arc
by Madame Berthe Girardet, of Neuilly, France. This bust, accepted
by your secretary on behalf of the Board of Regents of the Institu-
tion, is a gift from the sculptress through Mrs. Grace Whitney Hoff,
“in memory of what the American soldiers did in France at a
crucial time of need—in gratitude to the mothers, to the wives, to
the sisters and sweethearts, and to all those who gave their dear
ones whose blood has mingled with the soil of France.” The bust
is installed in the National Gallery of Art.

HAMILTON FUND LECTURE

The Rev. James Hamilton, in 1875, placed under the administra-
tion of the Smithsonian Institution a sum of money, designated as
the Hamilton fund, the interest from which is to be used for “lec-
tures on scientific or useful subjects.” Under the auspices of this
fund there was delivered on April 18, 1923, an interesting lecture
by Dr. Sven Hedin, the noted Swedish explorer, on his discoveries
of ancient cities and manuscripts in eastern Turkestan and his latest
explorations in southern Tibet. The lecture was profusely illus-
trated with lantern slides, and Doctor Hedin described graphically
the dangers and hardships incident to a journey through the great
desert regions in which he worked. The lecture, to which the Wash-
ington public was invited, had a large attendance.

DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA NATURE STUDY EXHIBIT

Four of the foyer rooms in the New National Museum have been
set aside for a local exhibit, which, it is hoped, will meet a long-felt
want of teachers and students and people generally interested in the
fauna and flora of the District of Columbia and its immediate
vicinity.

Two of the rooms are devoted to the birds and it is intended to
install a complete representation of all species reported for the Dis-
trict. A third room is devoted to the mammals, reptiles, batrachians,
and fish of the District, while the fourth room has the commoner in-
sects—butterflies, dragonflies, beetles, etc——and swinging frames
containing beautifully pressed specimens of local plants. It is in-
tended to change the contents of these frames as the season advances,
so that anyone wishing to know what is in flower at the particular
time in question will find the specimen represented in the frame in
its regular systematic position, as well as a photograph of the habitat
and some detail pictures. Here, too, is installed a stereomotorgraph
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 13

which alternately shows series of pictures of plants and birds, the
plants as they come into flower and the birds about their nest, feed-
ing stations, or bird baths.

Judging from the attendance which these exhibits have already
called forth and the numbers of inquiries which have been made by
teachers and persons interested, there is no question about the ad-
visability of having furnished the school system and nature lovers
of Washington these aids to visual education.

TWENTIETH INTERNATIONAL CONGRESS OF AMERICANISTS

The twentieth meeting of the International Congress of Ameri-
canists, held at Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, in August, 1922, was attend-
ed by Dr. Walter Hough and Dr. Ales Hrdlitka, of the National
Museum, who represented the Smithsonian Institution and were also
designated by the State Department to represent the United States.
Means were provided to repay the expenses of the delegates by the
Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. A great many papers
of scientific value were presented in several languages at the Con-
gress, and the delegates feel that a great stimulus was given to the
promotion of anthropological science, especially in Brazil.

PUBLICATIONS

The Institution and its branches issued during the year a total of
100 volumes and pamphlets, of which there were distributed 139,666
copies, including 130 volumes and separates of the Smithsonian Con-
tributions to Knowledge, 18,801 volumes and separates of the Smith-
sonian Miscellaneous Collections, 25,229 volumes and separates of
the Smithsonian Annual Reports, 3,016 Smithsonian special publica-
tions, 72,529 volumes and separates of the publications of the Na-
tional Museum, 17,694 publications of the Bureau of American Eth-
nology, 816 publications of the National Gallery of Art, 1,309 vol-
umes of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, 31 reports
on the Harriman Alaska Expedition, and 74 reports of the American
Historical Association.

Through its publications the Institution carries out one of its
primary functions, the “ diffusion of knowledge among men.” Many
of its publications are the results of scientific researches conducted
by members of the staff, others are prepared by outside scientists
who have carried on special investigations on the collections of the
National Museum and still others are intended for the general reader
who takes an interest in the progress of science but is not benefited
by the more technical papers mentioned above. In this last class
‘comes the General Appendix to the Smithsonian Annual Report,
which consists of a series of articles by authorities in the matters
treated, outlining the more noteworthy and interesting advances in
14 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

many lines of scientific work, including physics, chemistry, astro-
physics, geology, biology, and anthropology. These are written in a
style to attract the average intelligent reader, and there is a very gen-
eral demand for the reports. A cataloguer in the office of the Super-
intendent of Documents, where all public documents are distributed,
has placed the Smithsonian report first in point of number of re-
quests from libraries to receive this publication.

The publications of the National Museum and of the Bureau of
American Ethnology are mentioned in detail in the report on pub-
lications, appended hereto.

Nine papers were issued during the year in the series of Smith-
sonian Miscellaneous Collections, among which may be mentioned
one by your secretary resulting from his geological field work in the
Canadian Rocky Mountains; a timely paper by Mr. Mitman, of the
Museum staff, on “Some Practical Aspects of Fuel Economy ”;
and a contribution from Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, chief of the Bureau
of American Ethnology, on the “ Designs on Prehistoric Pottery
from the Mimbres Valley, New Mexico,” which was fully illus-
trated with striking Indian designs.

Allotments for printing.—The congressional allotments for the
printing of the Smithsonian reports and the various publications of
the branches of the institution were practically used up at the close
of the year. The appropriation for the coming year ending June
30, 1924, totals $77,400, allotted as follows:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 15

Committee on printing and publication—The function of the
Smithsonian advisory committee on printing and publication is to
make recommendations to the secretary regarding the technical merit
and suitability of all manuscripts submitted for publication by the
Smithsonian Institution or its branches, and also to consider all
other matters relating to printing and binding under the institution.
During the past year seven meetings were held and 104 manuscripts
acted upon. The membership of the committee is as follows: Dr.
Leonhard Stejneger, head curator of biology, National Museum,
chairman; Dr. George P. Merrill, head curator of geology, National
Museum; Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, chief, Bureau of American Eth-
nology; Mr. N. Hollister, superintendent, National Zoological Park;
and Mr. W. P. True, editor of the Smithsonian Institution, secre-
tary.

LIBRARY

Much has been accomplished during the year toward better
library service. The number of publications loaned during the year
reached a total of 12,076, and fully as many were consulted without
being taken out. A list has been prepared each day of the principal
contents of scientific and technical periodicals received for the Smith-
sonian Deposit at the Library of Congress, and copies are circulated
among the heads of scientific bureaus under the Smithsonian Insti-
tution. The subject catalogue of the Museum library has been
increased by 4,400 cards, and progress has been made in the arrange-
ment of cards of the Concilium Bibliographicum, received since the
close of the war.

The third volume of the “ Bibliography of Aeronautics,” covering
the years 1917 to 1919, inclusive, compiled by the assistant librarian
of the Smithsonian Institution, Mr. Paul Brockett, was issued dur-
ing the year by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.

Of the 10,938 volumes and other publications added to the library,
5,719 were for the Smithsonian Deposit at the Library of Congress,
4,285 for the National Museum, and the others for the remaining
libraries administered under the Smithsonian Institution.

NATIONAL MUSEUM

While without increased financial resources it has been impossible
for the Museum during the year to increase the scope of its exhibits
and of their usefulness to the public, nevertheless much has been
accomplished along the lines of filling in gaps in existing collections
and of increasing their value through classification and arrangement.
.The Museum has been fortunate in being able to keep together most
of its scientific staff. Im many cases this has been possible only
because of the devotion of the persons and their willingness to accept
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

employment in what should be their leisure hours in order to meet
living expenses. Better conditions are expected to result, however,
from the passage by Congress of the reclassification act of 1923,
which becomes effective July 1, 1924.

The Museum acquired during the year a total of 217,611 specimens.
While numerically this is only 60 per cent as many as received during
the previous year, many of the accessions are of exceptional value,
either intrinsically or from a scientific point of view. The distri-
bution of duplicate specimens, mainly to educational institutions,
totaled 9,131 specimens, classified and labeled. About one-half of
these were in regular sets already prepared for shipment, and the
other half were specially selected to meet particular needs. Nearly
35,000 duplicates, chiefly relating to botany and geology, were sent
out in exchange, resulting in the acquisition of much desirable mate-
rial. Over 12,000 specimens were lent to specialists for study pur-
poses. The material received by the Museum during the year is
described somewhat fully in the report of the administrative assist-
ant in charge, appended to this report, but it may be well to here
mention briefly some of the outstanding accessions. Among much
material in anthropology, there may be mentioned an expressive
carved stone figure from the Makah Indians; casts of the famous
La Quina and Obercassel skulls and skeleton; a series of archeo-
logical specimens from Haiti; an ethnological collection from For-
mosa; and casts of the busts of the heretic Pharaoh, Amenophis IV,
and his queen.

The biological specimens received during the year, while fewer in
number, compare favorably in scientific value with those of previous
years and probably are above the average. Perhaps the outstanding
accession in biology was the Evezard collection of recent mollusks
presented by the late John B. Henderson, while another of great
scientific interest is the series of Opalinid ciliate infusorians pre-
pared by Prof. Maynard M. Metcalf. A significant feature of the
year’s accessions is the fact that some of the most important are from
China as a result of a deliberate effort to improve systematically the
study material from the Palearctic region which is of fundamental
importance for a full understanding of our North American fauna.
Several expeditions from which biological material may be expected
to come to the Museum are now in the field in China. A number of
other expeditions to South America and elsewhere during the year
have resulted in much valuable material, the National Herbarium
especially being enriched. Striking new exhibits in the department
of biology include several species of Australian mammals, a Malay
tapir, and a gorilla collected in French Congo by Mr. Aschemeier,
of the Museum staff. The scientific staff has continued to carry on
research work on the study collections, resulting in the publication
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 17

of many papers in the various Museum series. The total number of
specimens of animals and plants now in the Museum collections is
estimated to exceed 7,000,000.

Among the important accessions in the department of geology may
be mentioned the valuable paleontological collection of the late
Orestes St. John, consisting principally of fossil fishes, donated by
Dr. Frank Springer, and a collection of not less than 10,000 speci-
mens, mainly fossil plants, presented by the heirs of the late R. D.
Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa. The residuary portion of the meteorite col-
lection of the late Prof. H. A. Ward was presented by Mrs. Coonley
Ward, and 18 additional accessions of meteorites were received. A
number of important mineralogical specimens were acquired, largely
through exchanges, including a portion of a large boulder of jade
received from Col. W. B. Thompson and a fine specimen of crystal-
lized descloizite from southwest Africa. Several unusual cut gems
were purchased through the Chamberlain endowment fund. An
important phase of the work of the department of geology consists
in furnishing assistance to schools and students, chiefly through the
distribution of materials needed in their studies. Eighty-one educa-
tional institutions were thus aided during the year.

The collections of textiles, wood technology, organic chemistry,
foods, and medicine, all under the supervision of the curator of
textiles, received many valuable specimens, numbering over 2,000.
Among the most important of these are a large series of specimens
of pyralin, bakelite, condensite, and cellulose acetate, all substitutes
for natural raw materials, such as ivory, bone, horn, tortoise shell,
amber, etc., the supplies of which are growing scarcer every year;
beautiful specimens of silks, woolen fabrics, and mohair upholstery
textiles; an exhibit showing the process of manufacture of double-
tipped matches; and specimens showing the use of chaulmoogra oil
derivatives in the treatment of leprosy in Hawaii.

In the divisions of mineral and mechanical technology, graphic
arts, and history, an unusually large and valuable series of objects
has been accessioned during the year. The divisions of mineral and
mechanical technology, in their conservation program, cooperated
with Mr. S. S. Wyer in preparing a work under the title “The
Smithsonian Institution’s Study of Natural Resources Applied to
Pennsylvania’s Resources,” which was distributed free to school
teachers throughout Pennsylvania and used in certain courses in the
grade schools. Seven loan exhibits shown in the division of graphic
arts brought the division prominently before the local public, and two
traveling exhibits prepared in the division were shown in various
cities. The division of history received, besides several other im-
portant accessions of military, naval and antiquarian material, the
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

entire collection of numismatic material formerly exhibited in the
United States mint in Philadelphia, transferred to the Museum
owing to the closing of the mint to the public.

A number of field expeditions in which the Museum was interested
resulted in greatly enriching the collections in all departments,
though mainly in biology and geology. These expeditions are de-
scribed in the report on the Museum appended hereto. The usual
large number of meetings, congresses, and receptions were held in
the auditorium and rooms of the Natural History Building. Visitors
to the Natural History Building totaled 508,518, to the Arts and
Industries Building, 259,542, to the Smithsonian Building, 95,168,
and to the Aircraft Building, 42,904. The Museum published dur-
ing the year 10 volumes and 42 separate papers, of which there were
distributed a total of 72,529 copies.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

In the National Gallery, the year has seen substantial advance in
a number of directions, although additions to the art collections have
not been so numerous as in several previous years. The time of the
staff has been devoted largely to the receipt, installation, and care
of the collections; to completing the records and labeling; and to the
preparation of matter for publication for the purpose of arousing
interest in the National Gallery, especially in its vital need of a
gallery building. A recent act of Congress authorizes the raising
of funds for a National Gallery Building and provides a site in the
Smithsonian Park for its erection, and the gallery has made every
effort during the year to bring forcibly to the attention of the public
the urgency of providing a suitable building to take care of the grow-
ing national art collection and to offer better inducements to pro-
spective donors to the Nation of valued art material. Furthermore,
there must be in America a National Gallery of Art Building if we
are to take a respectable place among the civilized nations of the
world in the field of art, and the director of the gallery has en-
deavored in several published articles to make known this national
shortcoming and to stir the pride of a people not accustomed to take
a second or third place in any field worthy of their ambition.

The National Gallery Commission held its second annual meet-
ing on December 12, and numerous important problems connected
with the work of the gallery and with its future were considered.
Following the reports of committees, a new committee was appointed
to look after the gallery’s interests in the final disposition of pur-
chases made from the Ranger bequest fund.

The 21 portraits of distinguished leaders of America and other
allied nations in the war with Germany, painted by a number of
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY : 19

leading American pairiters under the auspices of the National Art
Committee, have now returned to the National Gallery and will re-
main on permanent exhibition, after having been displayed in 25
of the larger cities through the offices of the American Federation of
Arts.

The gallery received by gift during the year a number of paintings
and other art works, and several interesting collections were loaned,
among them the famous McFadden Collection of 43 portraits and
landscapes of the British School, which is deposited in the gallery
pending its permanent housing by the city of Philadelphia. Several
special exhibitions were held in the gallery, including an exhibition
of American Handicrafts assembled and circulated by the American
Federation of Arts, and a collection of antique Etruscan, Greco-
Roman, and Byzantine jewelry, ancient glassware, and pottery ex-
hibited under the auspices of the Archeological Society of Wash-
ington.

The first catalogue of collections to be issued since the establish-
ment of the gallery as a separate unit appeared during the year.
The catalogue contains an account of the development of the art
interests of the Smithsonian Institution and an outline of the or-
ganization of the gallery, followed by a list of the art works with
brief biographies of the artists, and is illustrated with 25 plates of
certain of the most noteworthy paintings and sculptures in the
gallery.

FREER GALLERY OF ART

The examination, classification, and preliminary cataloguing of
Chinese and Japanese stone sculptures and jades, begun in 1922, was
completed during the year. New work begun includes the prelimi-
nary cataloguing and final storage of Chinese and Japanese bronzes,
lacquers, and wood sculptures, Near Eastern and Egyptian pottery,
and miscellaneous objects of bone, ivory, metal, glass, etc. The
autumn, winter, and early spring were largely devoted to the installa-
tion of exhibits and preparations for the formal opening of the
gallery to the public on May 2, 1923.

For the opening week, there were issued 3,300 invitations, and the
gallery was then opened to the public. From May 9 until the
end of the period covered by the report of the gallery, June 30, the
tota attendance was 32,648. Beginning June 11, the building was
closed on Mondays, making the exhibitions available on Sundays to
many people who are unable to come on week days.

The field work of the gallery included a trip to Europe by Miss
Guest to attend as a delegate from the gallery the the meetings of the
Société Asiatique de Paris, held in Paris from July 10 to 18, follow-
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

ing which she devoted two months to a study of various collections
of Oriental art in France, England, and Germany. On February 12,
Mr. Bishop, of the gallery staff, left for China, in charge of an ar-
cheological expedition sent out under the joint auspices of the Freer
Gallery of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Up to the
close of the year, Mr. Bishop’s chief concern was with matters of
organization, which he has now settled very successfully. He also
visited several sites of great archeological interest and made observa-
tions of importance to the future work of the expedition.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

The chief has endeavored to expend in the most economical man-
ner the funds appropriated by Congress for “ continuing ethnological
researches among the American Indians and the natives of Hawaii,
etc.,” although considerable difficulty has been encountered owing
to the greatly increased cost of field work and maintenance. There
has been a great awakening of interest in matters concerning the
aboriginal inhabitants of America, and never before has there been
such a general demand for the published works of the bureau. The
great archeological discoveries in Egypt have created a new popular
interest in the Science of Man, and the chief is endeavoring to meet
this situation by increasing the output of the bureau in the form of
popular publications in addition to the usual technical works. The
past year’s work includes archeological and historical study of the
Indians as well as work on documentary history. Somewhat detailed
accounts of the various researches carried on during the year are con-
tained in the report of the chief of the bureau, Appendix 4 of this
report, so that it will here be necessary only to indicate the character
and scope of the work.

From July to September, 1922, the chief completed the excavation
and repair of Pipe Shrine House on the Mesa Verde National Park,
Colorado, begun the previous year. This exceptional ruin is now
open for the inspection of visitors to the park. He also excavated
and repaired Far View Tower, an instructive circular ruin with three
subterranean kivas, probably an outlook for observation of the sun
and ceremonies connected with the sky god. In June, 1923, the chief
visited various localities in the neighborhood of Deming, southern
New Mexico, for the purpose of examining and obtaining speci-
mens of a beautiful form of prehistoric Indian pottery which had
been discovered in that region. The remarkable pictures on this
pottery throw considerable light on the ethnology of an ancient
people of whom we would otherwise have practically no knowledge.

Dr. John R. Swanton completed three manuscripts for publica-
tion during the year, besides carrying on important linguistic and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 21

ethnological researches in the office. Dr. Truman Michelson began
the year conducting ethnological researches among the Fox Indians
of Iowa, where he collected sufficient material for a manuscript on
the origin of one of the Fox societies. Tribal dissensions cut short
Doctor Michelson’s stay among the Fox and he undertook a recon-
naissance among the Potawatomi of Wisconsin, the Chippewa at
Reserve in the same State, the Ottawa of Michigan, the Delaware-
Munsee of Lower Canada, and the Montagnais of Lake St. John.
In May, 1923, he left for the field to make a reconnaissance of the
Algonquian tribes of eastern United States and Canada, including
the Labrador peninsula.

Mr. John P. Harrington prepared several manuscripts for pub-
lication during the year, and carried out linguistic researches with
Mr. Cipriano Alvarado, a Quiché Indian of Guatemala. In May,
1923, Mr. Harrington went to Santa Barbara, Calif., for the pur-
pose of continuing his researches on the Indians of that State. He
secured a large quantity of manuscript material bearing on myths,
place names, historical notes, early life and customs, genealogies, and
Indian songs. He also participated in the excavation of the famous
Burton Mound on the beach at Santa Barbara, which resulted in the
discovery of a great mass of Indian skeletons, trinkets, and utensils.
Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt completed two manuscripts for publication,
and in May, 1923, left for ethnological field work among the Six
Nations of Iroquois near Brantford, Ontario, Canada, where he
elaborated and revised texts recorded there previously and also
recorded much valuable information relating to the institutions of
the league. Later he visited the Onondaga Reservation near Syra-
cuse, N. Y. Mr. Francis La Flesche was engaged during most
of the year in assembling his notes for the third volume of his work
on the Osage Tribe.

The report on the bureau then discusses, under special researches,
the work of Miss Frances Densmore on the Indian music of the
Yuma, Mohave, and Papago Tribes; the archeological investigations
by Mr. W. E. Myer of ancient Indian mounds in central Tennessee ;
archeological work on the Stratman cave in Maries County, Mo.,
by Mr. Gerard Fowke; and field studies by Mr. John L. Baer on
the banner stones and pictographs in the Susquehanna River region,
Pennsylvania.

The bureau published during the year two annual reports with
lengthy accompanying papers and two bulletins. Several other
publications were in press at the close of the year. Of the bureau
series, there were distributed during the year a total of 17,694
copies.

22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES

The total number of packages of scientific and governmental
publications sent abroad and received from foreign agencies for dis-
tribution in this country during the year was 377,826, weighing
492.816 pounds. This is a decrease in number of packages and in
weight from the previous year, owing partly to the smaller size
of the publications handled this year. These publications were for-
warded in 2,223 boxes, in addition to which 40,000 packages were
sent direct to their destinations by mail whenever a sufficient quan-
tity for box shipments had not accumulated when the regular
monthly consignments were forwarded.

Exchange relations were resumed with Roumania during the year,
the Institutul Meteorologic Central at Bucharest acting as the official
Roumanian exchange bureau. Conditions in Russia and Turkey had
not sufficiently improved at the close of the year to warrant the
establishment of official exchange bureaus in those countries, but
the Institution has arranged with the American Friends Service
Committee to forward to Russia the large accumulation of exchange
material for correspondents in that country. Seventy boxes were
thus forwarded to Russia during the year. The State Library
(Riigiraamatukogu), Reval, was designated as the exchange agency
for Esthonia.

There were sent to depositories abroad during the year 57 ful]
sets of United States official documents and 38 partial sets, and the
Congressional Record was exchanged with 44 establishments abroad.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

The actual number of animals on exhibition at the close of the
year was greater than in any previous year, and the scientific value
of the collection is greater than ever before. For the fourth suc-
cessive year the number of visitors to the park has exceeded 2,000,000,
and its value in natural history instruction is again shown by the
fact that 171 schools, classes, and other organizations visited the park
during the year, with a total of 14,185 individuals. Friends of the
park have been even more than usually generous in presenting
animals, 266 specimens having been thus added during the year.
Of special interest among these may be mentioned a number of
desirable animals presented by Mr. Victor J. Evans, including
specimens of the frog-mouth and New Guinea fruit pigeon; valuable
collections of South American animals contributed by Hon. Henry D.
Baker and Mr. William J. LaVarre; a collection of animals pre-
sented by Mr. Gordon MacCreagh, including the rare red ouakari
monkey and the matamata turtle; and a number of interesting
animals from southern Mexico collected by Dr. William M. Mann.
REPORI OF THE SECRETARY 93

At the close of the year there were in the collections a total of
1,768 animals, an increase of 87 over the previous year. This total
represents 498 different species, including 184 species of mammals,
271 of birds, and 48 of reptiles. There were born or hatched in the
park during the year 80 mammals and birds, while the death rate
has again been kept at a very low mark. Sixty-six surplus mam-
mals and birds were sent away in exchange to other zoological
gardens, which resulted in securing some-very desirable specimens
for the park.

Among the improvements undertaken during the year the super-
intendent’s report mentions the complete reconstruction of the wolf
and fox dens below the sea-lion pool, making the quarters for these
animals much more comfortable and sanitary and greatly improved
in appearance. The principal construction during the year was
the continuation of the grading of the area left vacant through the
changing of the main automobile road through the park. Here will
soon be available a large area of flat ground, on which paddocks are
being completed for Rocky Mountain goats, red deer, barasingha
deer, and Japanese deer, Indian buffaloes, tahr goats, aoudads, axis
deer, and similar species. The outdoor cages for rhesus and other
monkeys were all repaired, repairs to the ostrich inclosure were
made, and safety guards placed along the fence in front of the main
bear dens. The principal needs of the park, as enumerated by the
superintendent, are a suitable restaurant building, which has been
urged for many years, a new bird house to replace the old temporary
one, which is far too small and in very bad condition, and the es-
tablishment of a reasonable fund to enable the park to grasp the
occasional opportunities offered to secure rare and desirable animals
which otherwise it is impossible to obtain.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

The observatory now occupies a number of frame structures south
of the Smithsonian Building, at Washington; a cement observing
station and frame cottage for observers on Mount Wilson, Calif.;
an observing station at Montezuma, Chile; and a new observing
station on Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz.; the last erected from funds
donated for the purpose by Mr. John A. Roebling, of New Jersey.
At Washington no observations were attempted, but as much time
as possible was devoted to computations necessary to the following:

(1) The search for systematic errors in the work of Mount Harqua Hala,
Ariz., and the application of carefully determined eorrections thereto.

(2) The publication of a comparison of two years of observations at Mount
Harqua Hala, Ariz., and Mount Montezuma, Chile.

(3) The preparation of a new set of curves for use from January 1, 1923,
in the short method of solar constant determination at Montezuma, Chile.
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

(4) The search for systematic errors and the application of carefully de-
termined corrections to Montezuma results on the new basis.

(5) The reductions of observations made at Mount Wilson in 1922 on the
form of the solar spectrum energy curve and on the spectrum energy curves
of 10 of the brighter stars.

This large computing program has resulted in putting the two
stations on an equal footing in every possible way.

At Mount Wilson the director and Mr. Aldrich redetermined the
form of the solar spectrum energy curve, varying the procedure as
far as possible so as to get several independent checks on the results.
They also accomplished the difficult task of the observation of the
prismatic energy spectrum of 10 of the brighter stars in the focus
of the 100-inch reflector on Mount Wilson. The results of both
of these researches were published in the Smithsonian Miscellaneous
Collections, volume 74, No. 7, 1923.

The two observing stations at Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., and
Mount Montezuma, Chile, have continued in operation throughout
the year, and the results have been very numerous. They had not
been critically compared at the close of the year.

The work on solar radiation, begun in 1903, has been steadily im-
proved, until with the continuous year-round occupation for two
years of two first-rate observing stations the decisive test has been
made, proving the substantial character of solar variation. In short,
the director believes that there is no longer a reasonable doubt that
the sun varies or that the observations can reveal these variations
satisfactorily. It is now a question for meteorologists whether these
variations are of importance in weather forecasting.

Just after the close of the fiscal year some preliminary observa-
tions were made on changes in the appearance of the sun accom-
panying changes in the output of radiation. Two years of record
prints from direct photographs and spectroheliograms of the sun
made at the Mount Wilson Solar Observatory were compared with
the corresponding two-year records of solar radiation, and there
were established four general rules or principles connecting the
solar radiation with the sun’s visible appearance.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LIT-
ERATURE

In the report of the Regional Bureau of the International Cata-
logue of Scientific Literature for 1922 attention was called to an
international convention to be held at Brussels during July, 1922,
to consider the affairs of the catalogue and to the proposals to be
submitted by the Smithsonian Institution. It is satisfactory to be
able to report that at this convention these proposals formed the
basis of the resolution whereby all the countries represented agreed
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 25

to keep alive the various regional bureaus until international affairs
would allow reorganization and resumption of publication. There
‘appears to be no question of the need of an international bib-
liography of science and of international cooperation in its pro-
duction; therefore as the International Catalogue of Scientific Lit-
erature is the only such organization in existence it is the logical
foundation on which to base future operations, whether these opera-
tions are to be aided through private endowments or official
guarantees.

NECROLOGY

ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL

Alexander Graham Bell, a regent of the Smithsonian Institution
from 1898 to 1922, died at his summer home in Nova Scotia on
August 2, 1922. Doctor Bell, best known for his invention of the
telephone, was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, in 1847, and was edu-
cated at Edinburgh and London universities. He later received
many honorary degrees from universities in this country and abroad.
A patent was granted on March 17, 1876, for his invention of the
telephone, and in 1883, with C. A. Bell and Sumner Taintor, he in-
vented the graphophone. His many other notable inventions for
the benefit of mankind include the photophone, induction balance,
and telephone probe for painless detection of bullets in the human
body.

He was deeply interested in the subject of deafness and its cor-
rection, and founded and endowed in 1887 the Volta Bureau for the
increase of knowledge relating to the deaf. He was the author of
many scientific and educational monographs.

Doctor Bell occupied a prominent place in the affairs of the
Smithsonian Institution during the 24 years of his membership on
the board of regents, serving continuously from the time of his
appointment to the board as a member of its executive committee.

The loss of his active interest and sound advice will be deeply
felt by the institution.

JOHN BROOKS HENDERSON

John Brooks Henderson, regent of the Smithsonian Institution
since 1911, died January 4, 1923, at the age of 53. Mr. Henderson
was early attracted to scientific work and shortly after his graduation
from Harvard undertook his first expedition to the West Indies in
quest of land mollusks. These, together with marine mollusks, he
made his special study, and in the course of his work he made many
collecting trips to the Greater and Lesser Antilles. His first paper on
mollusks was published in 1894, and in the succeeding years his con-
26 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

tributions on this subject appeared in various journals and in the
publications of the United States National Museum. As a result of
his expeditions many thousands of valuable specimens have been *
added to the museum collections.

As a regent of the institution, Mr. Henderson took a keen and
active interest in all its affairs. During the year preceding his
death he served on the executive committee of the board of regents.

HENRY N. SPOTTSWOOD

Henry N. Spottswood, employed by the institution in various
capacities since 1889, died on December 1, 1922. Coming to the
institution as copyist in the National Museum and promoted through
various grades to clerk in the international exchange service, Mr.
Spottswood served the institution efficiently for over 33 years.

Respectfully submitted.

Cuartes D. Watcort, Secretary.
APPENDIX I
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the United States National Museum for the fiscal year end-
ing June 30, 1923.

Much has been accomplished this year along long- cent eee lines
of endeavor. Without increased financial resources to grasp the
many opportunities for widening the scope of the exhibits and of
their usefulness to the public, efforts were mainly concentrated on
filling gaps in existing collections and on increasing their value and
usefulness through classification and arrangement, the two primary
objects of the Museum as given in the fundamental act. The
Museum has continued, as in the past, to be greatly aided in this
work by workers in other governmental departments. For instance,
the Museum pays for the services of but three persons in connection

with the vast insect collection. However, this collection has had
during the year most of the time of 15 entomologists and a fluctuat-
ing number of preparators—usually about 25 persons in all. With
so many workers great progress has been made in studying and
arranging the collection. Here, as elsewhere in the Museum, prog-
ress was retarded tc a certain extent by lack of supplies, which the
Museum is unable to furnish with its very limited maintenance fund.

The organization of the Museum has been but slightly changed.
In August, 1922, the old collections of animal and vegetable products
were combined in a new section of organic chemistry in the depart-
ment of arts and industries, and an aid for that section was added to
the scientific staff.

An exchange of collections was made between two divisions of the
Museum on July 1, 1922, by which the division of history took over
the custody of tke small arms collection in the northwest court of
the Arts and Industries Building, which has been built up by the
division of mechanical technology, and the latter relieved the divi-
sion of history of the aircraft collection exhibited in the Aircraft
Building.

Great difficulty has been experienced in maintaining the quota of
watchmen necessary for guarding the buildings. The conditions
under which the watchmen are required to work here are more
onerous and exacting than in any other bureau of the Government.

27
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

With the funds at present available it has not been possible, especi-
ally since the Natural History Building has been opened on Sundays,
to grant the watchmen time off in lieu of Sundays and holidays. This
is done in some of the Government departments and every effort is
being made to secure the additional funds needed to make the watch
service in the Museum as attractive as elsewhere.

The Museum has, however, been fortunate in being able to keep
together most of its trained workers on the scientific staff. In a
number of instances this has been possible only because of the devo-
tion of the persons and their willingness to accept employment in
what should bé their leisure hours, in order to meet their current
expenses. This spirit of loyalty and devotion to the Museum is
appreciated.

A better era is anticipated. Nothing in the past has had a more
vital relation to the work ofthe Museum than the enactment by Con-
gress, on March 4, 1923, of the classification act of 1928, for a more
adequate pay schedule for the civilian employees of the Government,
with provisions for equal pay for equal services regardless of the
department in which the service is rendered. This reclassification
becomes effective on July 1, 1924, before which date much preliminary
work has to be completed. The writer was appointed liaison officer
for the Government bureaus under the institution. Tentative alloca-
tions of all the positions under the institution were made during the
latter part of the year and submitted to the personnel classification
board created to care for the matter.

The year just closed was the second under the operation of the
Budget system of estimates and appropriations, and necessarily in-
volved changes in many methods of planning and keeping accounts.
Operating as it has had to do on practically the same appropriations
for the past 10 or 15 years, the Museum has difficulty in making ends
meet, and it is only by rigid economy and by the omission of many
things that should be done that the year ends without a deficit.

The function of the National Museum as the depository of the col-
lections belonging to the United States is being recognized more, and
more, resulting, near the close of the fiscal year, in the transfer to
the Museum by the Treasury Department of the entire collection of
numismatic materials which the Government, up to a few years ago,
exhibited at the United States Mint in Philadelphia. Congress also
reaffirmed this function of the Museum in accepting the sword of
Maj. Gen. Richard Montgomery of the Continental Army, given to
the Nation by Miss Julia Barton Hunt, by directing that it be
deposited in the National Museum.

At the annual meeting of the American Association of Museums
in Charleston in April, 1923, the financial prospects were such that
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 29

arrangements were made for the establishment of headquarters in
the National Capital, with a salaried director and secretary, Prof.
Charles R. Richards and Mr. Laurence Vail Coleman, respectively.
The National Museum gave support to the movement by permitting
the association to have its offices in the Arts and Industries Build-
ing. Toward the end of the year headquarters of the association
were accordingly established on the third floor of the northwest
pavilion of that building. Professor Richards is spending his first
year on leave in order to make a survey of European museums, and
Mr. Coleman is in charge as acting director.

Three small rooms off the foyer in the Natural History Building,
which have been held exclusively for use of temporary loan ex-
_ hibits—usually in connection with gatherings in the auditorium—
were this year assigned to the department of biology for the display
of the animals of the District of Columbia. These collections, which
for lack of room had been scattered in various halls or stored away,
are now brought together and made available for students, amateurs,
and school children of Washington.

In the Arts and Industries Building a new exhibition hall was
prepared and opened to the public during the year, being a small
room on the second floor of the southeast range. Here is shown an
attractive display of historical relics received from the Military
Service Institution, including the famous horse owned by Gen. Phil
Sheridan.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT

The National Museum, in its own buildings and in the Smithsonian
Building, occupies an aggregate floor space of over 670,000 square
feet, or over 1514 acres, with roof area of approximately 534 acres,
and some 2,000 windows. The upkeep is necessarily considerable,
especially when it is recalled that the Smithsonian Building has been
erected nearly 70 years, the Arts and Industries Building about 43
years, and the so-called South Shed about 25 years. The other
structures are more recent, the Natural History Building being about
14 years old and the Aircraft Building about 6. Most of the space
is used for exhibition. purposes and must at all times be kept in good
repair and in sightly condition. Constant vigilance is necessary to
properly maintain these buildings within the appropriation allotted
for the purpose, and it is only by strict economy that the present sat-
isfactory results are accomplished.

Early in the year an emergency arose, namely, the falling of large
pieces of plaster from the ceiling under the dome of the rotunda in
the Arts and Industries Building, which necessitated the expenditure
of 40 per cent of the entire appropriation provided for the mainte-
nance of the buildings.

1454—25—_4
30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

In the Natural History Building the most extensive repairs con-
sisted of painting the east and west hall attics, the watchmen’s room
on the first floor, and tin gutters of roof, and the replacing of worn-
out down spouts. The water table outside this building and the road-
ways on the south, east, and west sides of it were repaired. Meas-
urements made this year show that the movement of the keystones of
the stone arches in the rotunda has been but very slight. Observa-
tions and measurements will, however, continue to be made at inter-
vals of a few months. The most important item in the Smithsonian
Building was the repairing of a broken metal finial on top of the
tower at the northwest corner of the main building. ad

Through the courtesy of the Commissioners of the District of
Columbia and the cooperation of the fire department, the exterior
walls of the Natural History Building were thoroughly washed in
August, 1922, materially improving the appearance of the building.
In attempting to get water for this purpose, the fire department dis-
covered that all of the fire hydrants in the Smithsonian Park were
in bad condition and of an antiquated type, leaving the buildings
practically unprotected in case of fire. The District Commissioners
called the attention of the Institution to the necessity of installing
new hydrants and of adding to their number. An estimate to cover
the installation of four new fire plugs in the Smithsonian Park was
included in the estimates submitted by the Institution to the Bureau
of the Budget in September, 1922. The estimate failed to receive
favorable action, but will be again submitted for consideration. The
fire plugs in all the buildings and the fire hose are tested regularly.

As usual, the power plant was not operated during the summer,
a commercial company supplying the light and power required.
While the plant was shut down the old feed-water heater, which
had been in use ever since the plant was first put in operation, was
replaced by a new Cochran open feed-water heater and meter.
effecting a marked saving in the consumption of fuel. During the
year 8,052 tons of bituminous and 15.5 tons of stove coal were con-
sumed. Heat was supplied the buildings in the Smithsonian group,
including the Freer Building, from October 9, 1922, until May 19,
1923. The total electric current generated was 376,293 kilowatt-
hours. The electric load was greatly increased by the opening of the
Freer Building to the public, near the close of the year, so that on
dark and cloudy days it is greater than can be safely carried on
the cables leading into the Natural History Building from the lines
of the Potomac Electric Power Co. Additional cables will have to be
installed to take care of this increase. The ventilation plant in the
Freer Building was operated in the usual manner during the winter
and up to the time the building was opened to the public, since
which time the speed of the fans has been materially increased, to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 31

provide the additional air necessary for properly ventilating the
galleries. The result obtained by the system has been more satis-
factory than was anticipated. While the temperature of the gal-
leries has been somewhat high on extremely hot days, the circula-
tion of air was sufficient to produce the necessary cooling effect in
spite of the fact that no help was gained from the air washers.

The ice machine in the Natural History Building produced 279.6
tons of ice. The plant is gradually growing less efficient from year
to year. An item covering the purchase of a new ice machine
was included in the estimates for appropriations submitted to the
Bureau of the Budget.

COLLECTIONS

The total number of specimens acquired by the Museum during
the year was approximately 217,611, about 60 per cent as many as
received during the preceding year. The value of the yearly incre-
ment can not, however, be appraised from numbers only. Many of
the acquisitions this year are exceptionally valuable, either scien-
tifically, as types and as representatives of new species and new
localities, or because of great intrinsic worth. Additional material
to the extent of 1,155 lots, mainly geological, was received during the
year for special examination and report, a service of which the
practical value was demonstrated during the World War.

The distribution of duplicates, mainly to schools and colleges for
educational purposes, aggregated 9,131 specimens properly classified
and labeled and 100 pounds of material suitable for blow-pipe
analysis. These distributions were about equally divided between
the regular sets of specimens previously prepared for shipment and
those specially selected to meet particular needs. Nearly 35,000
duplicate specimens, mainly botanical and geological, were sent out
in exchange, in return for which much desirable material was re-
ceived. Over 12,000 specimens were lent to specialists for study on
behalf of the Museum and otherwise.

Anthropology.—In anthropology the more important additions
were a carved stone figure from the Makah Indians, showing a
mastery of expression by the artist; casts of the La Quina and Ober-
cassel skulls and skeleton; a noteworthy Chinese harvest bell of gilt
bronze; a superior stone collar from Porto Rico; a series of archeo-
logical specimens from Haiti; an ethnological collection from For-
mosa; an ancient stone pipe from Kentucky with remarkable incised
decorations; and casts of the busts of the heretic Pharaoh, Ameno-
phis IV and his queen, and a statuette of the latter.

Biology.—While the number of biological specimens received dur-
ing the past fiscal year falls short of that of some of the previous
years, there is no cause for alarm, as the scientific value of the col-
32 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

lections compares favorably with and probably exceeds that of the
average. .

No single collection stands out prominently, except perhaps the
Evezard collection of recent mollusks, which was purchased and
presented to the Museum by the late John B. Henderson. Another
collection of great scientific interest is the series of Opalinid ciliate
infusorians prepared by Professor Maynard M. Metcalf, of Oberlin,
Ohio, which forms the basis of his monograph published during the
year by the Museum as its Bulletin No. 120. The most significant
feature of the year’s accessions is the fact that some of the more im-
portant ones are from China, as a result of deliberate efforts at im-
proving systematically the study material from the Palearctic region
which is of such a fundamental importance for a full understanding
of our North American fauna.

This tendency toward a more conscious development of the weak
portions of our collections was made possible by the explorations
now on the way in China undertaken by friends of the Museum, such
as Mr. Charles M. Hoy’s trip financed by Dr. W. L. Abbott, and Mr.
A. de C. Sowerby’s by Col. Robert S. Clark. Rev. D. C. Graham’s
explorations in the Province of Szechuen were also fruitful of scien-
tifically valuable material, while an expedition recently sent into the
field by the National Geographic Society under the leadership of Mr.
Frederick R. Wulsin holds great promise for the future. Many im-
portant gaps in our South American collections were also filled by
Dr. Hugh M. Smith as a result of his expedition to Uruguay. Dr.
W. L. Abbott’s visit to the Dominican Republic added materially
to our botanical and herpetological series. Secretary Walcott’s ex-
plorations in the Canadian Rockies, as well as Dr. Paul Bartsch’s
trip to the West Indies, and that of Dr. Leonard Stejneger to the
Commander Islands were also productive of desirable material. The
botanical expedition to Colombia by Dr. F. W. Pennell and Mr.
Ellsworth P. Killip, undertaken in cooperation with the Phila-
delphia Academy of Natural Sciences, the New York Botanical
Garden, and the Gray Herbarium of Harvard University, brought
home one of the largest and most important plant collections ever
obtained in that country. Dr. William R. Maxon had not returned
from Central America at the end of the fiscal year.

The Australian mammal exhibit has been further strengthened by
the addition of several species, and a Malay tapir was incorporated
in the Oriental region exhibit. Several other large mammals were
likewise mounted and placed on exhibition, among which the gorilla
mounted by Brown and Aschemeier from a specimen collected by the
latter a few years ago while attached to the Collins-Garner Expe-
dition to French Congo, deserves special mention. Good progress
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 83

was made in the arrangement and cataloguing of the study series,
which are described as in excellent condition.

The research work of the staff has continued unabated and several
important manuscripts were brought to a close or nearly finished
during the year. A large number of smaller papers were published
as a result of the year’s work, but the great majority of the published
results date further back, partly due to the difficulties in obtaining
speedy publication, partly because their preparation extends over a
period of years. Some very important systematic works done by
scientists not members of the staff, but based on Museum material,
were published during the year as Bulletins No. 100, vol. 5, and
Nos. 120 and 123.

Loans of specimens to scientific institutions and individual investi-
gators have been made on the usual liberal scale. Duplicates dis-
tributed to high schools, colleges, institutions, etc., aggregated 3,545
specimens, of which 1,490 consisted of mollusks in 10 prepared sets
and 608 fishes in 8 sets. Exchanges to the number of 28,693 were
sent out, of which 2,491 were zoological and 26,202 botanical.

The total number of specimens of animals and plants now in the
national collection is estimated to exceed 7,000,000, of which 1,150,000
are plants.

Geology.—Although accessions in the department of geology are
smaller in number than in the year previous, a considerable increase
in individual specimens and in their scientific value is to be noted.

The paleontological collection of the late Orestes St. John, consist-
ing principally of fossil fishes, many of them types, adds material
of incalculable value to the specialist who may take up the study of
this group, and Dr. Frank Springer, who made this donation, has
earned the thanks of future workers in thus placing it where it will
always be available. Another most notable accession is the residu-
ary portion of the collection of the late R. D. Lacoe, of Pittston, Pa.,
presented by his heirs. This is estimated to contain not less than
10,000 specimens, mainly fossil plants, with some invertebrates and
vertebrates, from many localities in this and foreign countries, and
from various geological horizons. Supplementing the collection is
Mr. Lacoe’s paleontological library comprising, it is estimated, at
least 2,000 volumes and an equal number of pamphlets. Mrs. Coon-
ley Ward generously donated the residuary portion of the meteorite
collection of her husband, the late Prof. H. A. Ward. This is of
value not so much in adding new meteorites as in furnishing mate-
rial for study and exchange. Thirteen additional accessions of
meteorites, mostly new to the collections, are recorded, received
chiefly through exchanges.
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Continued activities of Mr. Victor C. Heikes have resulted in the
acquisition of the most interesting of the recent additions to the
economic collections.

The division of mineralogy has benefited largely through ex-
changes. A most important acquisition is a portion of a large
boulder of jade received from Col. W. B. Thompson, and an un-
usually fine specimen of crystallized descloizite from southwest
Africa, acquired through Ward’s Natural Science Establishment.
Other exchanges resulted in adding upward of 60 pieces new to
the collection. Several cut gems of unusual quality and size were
purchased through the Chamberlain endowment fund.

The continued acquisition of foreign paleontological material is
to be noted. Chief among the contributors are Dr. E. O. Ulrich,
who made collections in northern Europe; Mr. Stephen R. Capps,
in Palestine; various oil companies and private collectors in Mexico,
Central and South America; Mr. Edwin A. Walford, of Banbury,
England; and various universities and institutions in Europe.

Research work has formed an important part of the department’s
activities during the year, and assistance has been furnished to
numerous schools and students, chiefly through the distribution of
materials needed in their studies. The records show that 81 educa-
tional institutions, chiefly high schools and small colleges, have been
given such assistance.

Textiles, wood technology, organic chemistry, foods, and medi-
cine.—The collections under the supervision of the curator of tex-
tiles, which, besides textiles, embrace wood technology, foods, organic
chemistry, and medicine, were increased by many gifts and by
transfer and loan of property from other Government bureaus,
amounting to over 2,000 objects. The most important of these are
as follows:

A large series of specimens of pyralin, bakelite, condensite, and
cellulose acetate, showing the manufacture and use of these products
of modern chemical industry as substitutes for such natural raw
materials as ivory, bone, horn, tortoise shell, amber, etc., the sup-
plies of which are growing scarcer every year; and a set of pneu-
matic bicycle tires made in 1891 and believed to belong to one of
the earliest types used. There were added by gift beautiful speci-
mens of silks, woolen fabrics, and mohair upholstery textiles con-
tributed by American manufacturers to show the progress of textile
industries in this country.

To the collections arranged to show the importance of wood and
the industries based upon the use of that raw material, there were
added wonderfully well preserved specimens of the ancient cypress
wood brought to the surface during the excavation for the founda-
tion and basement of the new Walker Hotel, Washington, and be-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 85

lieved to be over 30,000 years old; an exhibit showing the manufac-
ture of double-tipped matches; and another pointing out the ravages
of the white pine blister rust and methods for its control.

The collections in the division of medicine were enlarged by a
large collection of Italian hospital supplies of the type used in the
World War ‘and carried as field equipment by the Italian troops;
specimens showing the use of chaulmoogra oil derivatives in the
treatment of leprosy in the leper settlement of Molokai, Hawaii;
several ancient surgical instruments and medical manuscripts; and
a portrait in oil of Dr. Crawford W. Long.

Mineral and Mechanical Technology.—The divisions of mineral
and mechanical technology had the experience of adding more objects
to their collections within the year than in any single year since
their inception and almost wholly as a result of their uwn efforts.
Practically every section within the divisions shared in this incre-
ment, but chiefly the sections devoted to mechanical communication,
general mechanical engineering, coal-products industries, land trans-
portation, and aerial transportation. The objects acquired for the
section of communication will now make it possible to visualize the
developments of methods of communication from those of smoke and
fire to those of wireless telegraphy, with all of the essential inter-
mediate steps. To the mechanical engineering collection there was
added a series of models made in the divisions’ workshops illustrating
mechanical principles and the fundamental elements and devices
used in machines. The subject is by no means covered by this
series, which represents simply the beginning of a new activity
possessing valuable educational possibilities. To the coal products
industries section there was added a model illustrating the manu-
facture of coal gas and carburetted water gas. With this addition *
the divisions have covered fairly completely the fuel situation both
in the home and in industry. In other sections of the divisions the
additions to the collections tend toward a rounding out of individual
subjects. Thus there were added several models of aircraft; a loco-
motive model; a boat model, and an automobile. The electrical
engineering collections were enhanced by a working model of the
Ford automobile ignition system which admirably illustrates the
principle of induction as applied to electric current generation, a
principle which Joseph Henry independently observed and an-
nounced about the same time as the accredited discoverer, Faraday.

The divisions’ cooperative educational work, particularly that with
the State of Pennsylvania, became more firmly established through
‘the preparation by Mr. S. S. Wyer, associate in mineral technology,
of the book “ The Smithsonian Institution’s Study of Natural Re-
sources Applied to Pennsylvania’s Resources.” Copies of the book
were distributed free to school teachers throughout Pennsylvania
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

designated by the board of education and used in certain fitting
courses of the grade schools. One of the interesting reactions re-
sulting from this work was the assistance rendered by Mr. Wyer to
the city of Erie, Pa., in an intensive educational campaign organized
by the local chamber of commerce in an endeavor to conserve the
city’s natural gas supply, which is rapidly declining, due largely to
preventable wastage.

Graphic Arts—The 1,146 specimens assigned to this division
covered a wide range, materially exceeded in number those received
the preceding year, and brought the total number of specimens in
the division up to 22,936. Almost the beginning and the latest de-
velopment of type composition were represented in the year’s acces-
sions by a leaf of the Gutenberg Bible, one of the first books to be
printed from movable type, and examples of the monotype system
of composing and casting justified lines of single type. Other im-
portant acquisitions included a newspaper exhibit; specimens of
bookbinding; a unitype typesetting machine, wood-block prints and
etchings by Helen Hyde; 50 proofs of etchings, aquatints, wood-
block prints, lithographs, etc., the gift of 24 contemporary artists;
Woodville Latham’s motion picture projector of 1895; notable addi-
tions of pictorial photographic prints and color collections in pho-
tography; and many additions supplementing and completing ex-
isting exhibits.

Seven loan exhibits, five in the graphic arts halls and two in the
gallery devoted to the photographic section, brought the Museum
collections in these lines prominently before the local and visting
public. Two collections of pictorial photographs were lent for exhi-
bition elsewhere and, in furthering publicity outside of Washington,
*two traveling exhibits of about 100 specimens each were prepared
illustrating the principal processes of the graphic arts. The first of
these was shown in seven different cities and the second, prepared
later in the year, was exhibited only in one city.

History.—During the past fiscal year the historical collections re-
ceived, in addition to the normal increase along this line, two acces-
sions of unusual size and importance and one of unparalleled in-
trinsic and scientific value. The first of these includes the large
ageregation of antiquarian, costume, military, naval, and miscella-
neous materials collected by Mrs. Julian James during a long period
for deposit in the National Museum, which by the terms of her will
have now become the permanent property of the Institution. This
collection has already been described in previous reports, but its
permanent acquirement by the Museum is worthy of special note.
The second accession of unusual significance is a large collection of
historical military materials deposited in the Museum by the Mili-
tary Service Institution. The collection was assembled by this
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY ov

society beginning at the time of its organization in 1878, and con-
sists for the most part of swords, guns, pistols, flags, and miscella-
neous relics of the period of the Civil War, but includes also relics of
the former wars in which the United States has participated.
Among the most notable objects in the collection are a bronze can-
non captured from the British troops commanded by Maj. Gen.
John Burgoyne at Saratoga in 1777; a mortar made by D. King of
Philadelphia; a sword owned by Commodore Stephen Decatur,
United States Navy, and the mounted figure of the war horse of
Gen. Philip H. Sheridan.

The accession of unparalleled importance is one including the en-
tire collection ‘of numismatic material formerly exhibited in the
United States Mint in Philadelphia, which, owing to the closing of
this mint to the public, was transferred to the Museum by the Treas-
ury Department in June, 1923. This collection includes a large num-
ber of ancient coins, a fair representation of medieval European
coins, a very complete aggregation of modern European coins and
commemorative medals, a large collection of the temporary coins of
the period of the World War, and an exceptionally fine and large
collection of United States coins, medals, and paper currency. While
the acquirement of this collection by the Museum is most gratifying
in that it adds such an aggregation of intrinsically valuable matter
to the Museum collection, the most essential fact in connection with
the transaction is the basis which it offers for the future develop-
ment of the collection and the encouragement of the science of numis-
matics in the United States.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK

It is hoped that the falling off in biological exploration noted in
recent reports has reached its lowest ebb during the present year,
and that from now ou a turn of the tide may be expected. With
this possibility in view plans and problems for future biological
explorations and expeditions have been outlined, preparing the
Museum to take the greatest possible advantage of the hoped-for
improved conditions. The central idea proceeds from the fact that
the early biological problems and research of the Museum naturally
related to the fauna and flora of North America, especially that part
opened up by the War with Mexico and the explorations for rail-
road lines to the Pacific coast. The necessity of working up this
‘material was naturally paramount. With the purchase of Alaska a
hitherto unexplored territory on this continent naturally attracted
the attention of the National Museum, especially since the early ac-
tivities in Alaska were almost exclusively investigated by the Federal
Government with the result that nearly all the material collected
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

there came to Washington. So intensive was this study of the
native fauna, especially that of the vertebrates, that within a com-
paratively short time North America, from a taxonomic point of
view, was better explored and better known than any other part of
the world, Europe itself not excepted. At the time these intensive
studies began North America was regarded as one of the primary
zoogeographical divisions of the world, coequal with South America,
the oriental region, Africa, and the Europe-North Asian region, also
known as the palearctic region. Later on considerable collections
from the Pacific coasts of northern Asia and from Europe found
their way into the National Museum. It was then seen that the
North American fauna, at least that part which occupied the more
temperate portions of the continent northward, is most closely re-
lated to the palearctic fauna of temperate Asia and northward, and
it was realized that the dominant constituency of the North Ameri-
can fauna actually had its origin in the Old World. Here then is a
whole series of closely related problems seeking solution in Asia and
Europe. The circumstance that the United States Biological Sur-
vey has gradually taken over to a great extent the restricted North
American field for still more refined cultivation serves to stimulate
the interest of certain of the larger divisions of the National
Museum in the palearctic region. The Museum has already made a
good start in that direction. It has excellent collections in many
lines of the palearctic fauna. Its collection of European mammals
is one of the most comprehensive extent. It has excellent series of
birds, reptiles, and batrachians from Japan, Korea, and Kamchatka
in eastern Asia, besides a respectable representation in other classes.
It has also important material collected by the Lyman-Hollister
expedition to the Altai region some years ago, and the Koren-Avery
expedition to the mouth of the Kolyma.

It is, therefore, with special gratification that attention is called to
the work now in preparation and partly in progress for the biological
exploration of China in the interest of the National Museum. The
field work by Arthur de C. Sowerby, the expense of which is most
generously met by Robert S. Clark, which was started in the fall
of 1921, has continued during the present fiscal year, and very ma-
terial additions to our vertebrate collections have already resulted.

Of equal significance is the fact that Dr. W. L. Abbott, after the
return of Mr. Charles M. Hoy from Australia, decided to send him
to China to collect for the Museum. Mr. Hoy departed for his.
new field on December 15, 1922. Thus far no collections have been
received, due to difficulties of transportation and the political situa-
tion which has placed obstacles in the way of reaching the final
destination, but recent letters indicate that we may soon see tangible
results of his efforts.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 39

A third expedition in China, from which the National Museum is
expected to derive great benefit, is that of the National Geographic
Society, under the leadership of Mr. Frederick R. Wulsin who ‘is
already in the field.

In this connection should be mentioned the activities of Rev. D. C.
Graham, who, located at Suifu in the Province of Szechuen, China,
undertook an expedition to Mount Omei, from which the Museum
received very important collections, especially insects, birds, and rep-
tiles. He is planning to make an expedition to Tatsienlu, and pos-
sibly to Mupin, during the present summer, both localities of great
zoological interest.

Dr. W. L. Abbott revisited the Dominican Republic in February
and March, 1923, continuing his biological explorations of, recent
years. As his permit to collect birds was delayed until he was about
to leave the country he only obtained the skin of one bird and saved
its body in alcohol. His. collections of reptiles and amphibians,
however, were highly important, obtaining as he did a new species
of frog, recently described by Miss Cochran as Leptodactylus abbotti
from the specimen collected by him. It is nearly related to the one
from Porto Rico and establishes the genus as one definitely belong-
ing to the Antillean fauna. He also collected about 600 plants in
the southern part of the Samana Peninsula, which will doubtless
prove as interesting as the previous collections obtained in the same
region by Doctor Abbott, which have yielded a large number of new
species.

In connection with the heredity experiments conducted by Dr.
Paul Bartsch, under the joint auspices of the Smithsonian and Carne-
gie Institutions, it was found desirable to add several species of
Cerions in order to exhaust the apparent possibilities that this group
presents. For that reason Doctor Bartsch visited Porto Rico in
May, obtaining a large number of specimens of the desired Cerion,
as well as a large series of additional species. About 15,000 speci-
mens were added to the Museum collection as the result of the trip.

Dr. Hugh M. Smith, associate curator in zoology, spent several
months in South America, primarily for the study of the fur-seal
and other fisheries of Uruguay, during which time he made extensive
collections for the Museum in all branches, especially fishes, reptiles,
and marine invertebrates. He sailed from New York on September
23, 1922, returning in January, 1928. The opportunity to collect
in Brazil when the steamer stopped was improved, but the main
collections were made in Uruguay, especially at the Lobos Islands.
The collections form a most welcome addition to the Museum series,
which were very deficient in material from the region visited.

During the spring of 1923 Mr. C. R. Aschemeier, one of the taxi-
dermists, was given permission to accompany Mr. A. H. Fisher on an
expedition to the lower Amazon River, Brazil, the understanding

being that Mr. Aschemeier should devote his time to making collec-
tions of the vertebrates for the National Museum, with particular
reference to river dolphins and seacows. He left New York late in
April and no collections have been received as yet.

Dr. William M. Mann, assistant custodian, section of Hymenoptera,
undertook for the Department of Agriculture a trip to Mexico be-
tween January 19 and June 7, 1923, at the purpose of collecting and
studying certain fruit flies. the far as possible general collections of
insects were made and some reptiles and a few ethnological speci-
mens secured. The material has not as yet been accessioned, but
enough is known of it to prove its value, although owing to the
_extreme dryness of the season collecting was very poor. From
Nogales he went down the west coast of Mexico as far as Tepic,
making a 10-day side trip to Lower California in the district between
Loreto and Comondu. Afterwards the States of Jalisco and Colima
were visited and then a rather hurried trip was made to the Isthmus
of Tehuantepec and in Chiapas as far as Tapachula. He returned
by way of Loredo, Tex.

Secretary Charles D. Walcott’s expedition to the Canadian Rockies
was productive of valuable additions to the mammal collection, as
already mentioned. ,

The botanical explorations during the year have added materially
to the collections of the National Herbarium. Dr. W: L. Abbott’s
visit to the Dominican Republic has already been mentioned.

Mrs. Agnes Chase visited Europe from March until July, 1922, for
the purpose of studying the grass collections in the herbaria at
Vienna, Munich, Florence, Pisa, Geneva, Berlin, Leiden, Brussels,
Paris, and London, and many type specimens of American grasses
were examined. A large number of valuable specimens of grasses
also was obtained for deposit in the National Herbarium, including
fragments of many types and duplicates of early South American
collections.

Dr. William R. Maxon, associate curator of the division of plants,
left Washington in May, 1928, accompanying a party directed by
Mr. O. F. Cook, of the United States Department of Agriculture,
whose purpose is to investigate the rubber resources of Central
America. At the time of preparation of this report the party was
in Panama and it was expected that two months additional would
be spent in Central America.

Dr. A. 8. Hitchcock, custodian of the grass herbarium, left Wash-
ington in May, 1923, with the expectation of spending six months in
Bolivia, Ecuador, and Peru, where he intends to devote particular
attention to the study of grasses, but will also make collections of
other groups of plants. The expedition is supported jointly by the
United States Department of Agriculture, New York Botanical
Garden, and Gray Herbarium.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 41

Dr. Charles E. Resser, under the auspices of the United States
Geological Survey, accompanied Dr. E. O. Ulrich in an investiga-
tion of the Cambrian and Ordovician rocks of the Valley of Vir-
ginia during May, 1923, and secured important stratigraphic col-
lections. Dr. Ulrich with his assistant, Mr. R. D. Mesler, continued
field researches during the month of June, studying various sections
of the Appalachian Valley in eastern Tennessee. During his trip
to the International Geological Congress at Brussels in the summer
of 1922, Doctor Ulrich visited important Paleozoic localities in va-
rious European countries and presented to the Museum all of the
material collected.

While traveling in Europe in the summer of 1922, Miss Jessie G.
Beach was detailed to study collections in various museums, and to
consult with European scientists regarding matters of interest to the
Museum. Miss Beach visited museums in France, Italy, Germany,
Belgium, England, and Scotland, listing and sketching various type
specimens of unusual interest, and studying methods of installation
and labeling.

Mr. C. W. Gilmore, under the auspices of the Museum, made a
trip to Roy, N. Mex., to investigate a reported discovery of elephas
remains. The specimen proved to be valueless for museum purposes,
and from that standpoint the trip was a failure. Mr. N. H. Boss
made several short collecting trips to the Miocene deposits along
Chesapeake Bay in search of fossil remains. As in previous years
these trips were productive in the recovery of well-preserved ceta-
cean remains.

Late in the fiscal year Mr. Gilmore and Mr. Boss were detailed to
excavate remains of dinosaurs in the Dinosaur National Monument,
Utah, an undertaking which has long been awaiting a favorable op-
portunity for its consummation.

Assistant curators Foshag and Shannon on their own initiative
made a brief trip to old copper mines in Carroll County, Md., a
district which despite its proximity to Washington was practically
unrepresented in the collections. A large suite of copper and iron
ores and associations was secured. A day was likewise spent at the
diabase quarry near Belmont Park, Va. So much material of interest
was found that Mr. Shannon conducted the Washington Mineralogi-
cal Society over the ground on their annual field trip. The speci-
mens collected have been turned over to the Museum. The limestone
quarry at Leesburg, Va., was also visited and interesting mineralogi-
cal material secured.

Investigations by Miss Frances Densmore among the Yuma In-
dians of Arizona and some tribes in northern Mexico for the Bureau
42 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

of American Ethnology brought to the Museum a collection of
desirable ethnologica.

The third year of the exploration of ancient Pueblo Bonito, to
which the National Geographic Society has devoted $75,000, under
Neil M. Judd, the curator of American archeology, was productive
of a number of specimens now deposited in the Museum. The jour-
neys of Dr. Ale’ Hrdlicka to Brazil and Europe resulted in enriching
the collections of the division of physical anthropology. In June
Mr. Matthew W. Stirling, of the division of ethnology, carried on an
exploration of several ancient villages at Mobridge, S. Dak., and
collected a valuable series of material for the Museum.

For several other important expeditions in which the Museum was
interested see under Researches and Explorations in the report of the
secretary, page 6.

MEETINGS, CONGRESSES, AND RECEPTIONS

The auditorium and adjacent council rooms afforded accommoda-
tions during the year for 145 meetings, covering a wide range of
subjects. An innovation this year was a series of free Sunday after-
noon lectures arranged by the Woman’s Welfare Association. Here-
tofore the auditorium has not been used on that day.

The governmental agencies taking advantage of the meeting
accommodations, besides, of course, the Smithsonian Institution and
its branches, included the Budget Bureau and the Public Health
Service of the Treasury Department; the War Department and its
Army Medical School; the Women’s Bureau of the Department of
Labor; the Bureau of Entomology, the Forest Service, and the
Federal Horticultural Board of the Department of Agriculture.
The scientific and other groups included the National Academy of
Sciences, the National Association of Postmasters of the United
States, the National Committee on Prisons and Prison Labor, the
National Association of Travelers Aid Societies, the National Con-
ference of Social Work, the National Consumers’ League, National
Amateur Athletic Federation of America, the National Medical
Association, the National Baird Memorial Committee, the Garden
Club of America, the Girl Scouts, World’s Dairy Congress Associa-
tion, the American Association of Museums, Women’s Welfare Asso-
ciation, the American Horticultural Society, the Anthropological
Society of Washington, the Archaeological Society of Washington,
the Art and Archaeological League of Washington, the Audubon
Society of the District of Columbia, the Washington (D. C.) Chap-
ter of the Wild Flower Preservation Society of America, the Ento-
mological Society of Washington, the Federal Photographic Society,
the Shakespeare Society of Washington, the School of Foreign Serv-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 43

Ice of Georgetown University, the American University, Howard
University, the Garden Club of Washington, the Southern Society
of Washington, and the Reserve Officers’ Association of the District
of Columbia.

At the Twentieth International Congress of Americanists at Rio
de Janeiro, Brazil, August 20 to September 3, 1922, the Institution
was represented by Dr. Walter Hough, head curator of anthropology
in the Museum, and Dr. Ales Hrdlicka, curator of physical anthro-
pology in the Museum, who served also as delegates on the part of
the United States Government. Another member of the Museum
staff, Dr. E. O. Ulrich, associate in paleontology, represented the
Institution at the Thirteenth International Geological Congress meet-
ing in Brussels, Belgium, August 10 to 19,1922. The Museum was also
represented at the eighteenth annual meeting of the American Asso-
ciation of Museums, held in Charleston, S. C., April 4 to 7, Mr.
F. L. Lewton and the writer serving as delegates.

The Museum was the scene of several receptions. On the evening
of December 19 the halls of the Museum assigned to the National
Gallery of Art were opened for a reception following a lecture in the
auditorium under the auspices of the Anthropological Society of
Washington and the Archaeological Society of Washington. Oppor-
tunity was thus afforded for inspecting the collection of Chihuahua
pottery belonging to the latter society. On January 9 the Archaeo-
logical Society and the Art and Archaeological League of Washing-
ton held a reception in the National Gallery of Art following an
evening lecture by Count Byron Kuhn de Prorok, with a first view
of a rare collection of antique jewelry recently lent to the society by
one of its members, Mr. Kurt Walter Bachstitz, of The Hague.
Another large reception was that to the National Academy of
Sciences on the evening of April 23, in honor of Dr. W. W. Camp-
bell. This followed a lecture in the auditorium by Doctor Campbell.

The exhibition halls on the first floor of the Natural History
Building were the setting for a conversazione on the evening of
February 3, as a part of the program in celebration of the centenary
of the birth of Spencer Fullerton Baird, the second secretary of the
Smithsonian Institution. The Marine Band furnished music during
the evening. A meeting of Girl Scout leaders in the auditorium on
the evening of April 25 was the occasion for opening all the exhibi-
tion halls in the building from 6.30 to 11 p. m. to enable the Girl
Scouts, their leaders, parents, and friends to view the collections.

MISCELLANEOUS

The number of visitors to the Natural History Building during
the year aggregated 508,518; to the Arts and Industries Building,
259,542: to the Smithsonian Building, 95,168; and to the Aircraft
44 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Building, 42,904. The national collections in the Natural History
Building are accessible to the public every day in the year, Sundays
as well as week days. Owing, however, to the limited appropriations
for the maintenance of the Museum, the other buildings are not epen
on Sundays.

The Museum published during the year 10 volumes and 42 separate
papers. The former comprised the Annual Report of the Museum
for 1922; volumes 60 and 61 of the Proceedings; Bulletin 100, volume
5; Bulletins 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, and 126. The separates included
1 bulletin article; 4 papers in the series, Contributions from the
United States National Herbarium; 5 papers from volume 61, 21
papers from volume 62, and 11 papers from volume 63 of the Pro-
ceedings. The distribution of volumes and separates to libraries
and individuals on the regular mailing list aggregated 63,869 copies
besides 8,660 copies supplied in response to special applications.

The Museum library, as one of the libraries administered under the
direction of the Smithsonian Institution, enjoys the close coopera-
tion of its associated libraries and in turn contributes substantially
toward the general library activities. Much has been accomplished
during the year toward better library service. The long-needed
subject catalogue has been started, and at the close of the year 4,400
cards had been made and arranged. The arrangement of cards from
the Concilium Bibliographicum distributed since the World War is
well under way, and progress is being made in the reclassification
and shelving of the technological collections. Work has, however,
suffered from a lack of funds for binding and renovating and from
a vacancy in the staff during eight months of the year. The receipts
for the year numbered 1,489 volumes and 2,796 pamphlets, bringing
up the total of books and other material in the library to 160,560
titles. The number of loans made was 9,220, of which 5,191 were to
the sectional libraries.

The death of John B. Henderson, a Regent of the Smithsonian
Institution, on January 4, 1923, deprived the Museum of a valued
friend, a constant contributor and an indefatigable worker on its
collections. The members of the scientific staff and other employees
of the Museum and Institution gathered in the auditorium on Janu-
ary 8, 1923, to pay respect to their colleague and adopted resolu-
tions expressing their deep sense of loss. Doctor Walcott presided
and brief addresses were made by Doctor Walcott, Dr. W. H. Dall,
Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, and Dr. Paul Bartsch.

Respectfully submitted.

Administrative Assistant to the Secretary in charge,

AEE NLA. 2
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART

Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith the report on the activi-
ties of the National Gallery of Art for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1923.

The third year of the existence of the National Gallery as a sep-
arate administrative unit of the Smithsonian Institution has wit-
nessed substantial advance in a number of directions, although addi-
tions to the art collections have fallen below those of several pre-
vious years. The activities of the gallery continued in most respects
in directions corresponding with those of the two preceding years,
the energies of the limited staff being devoted largely to the receipt,
installation, and care of the collections; to completing the records
and labeling; and to the preparation and publication of matter
intended to aid in awakening an interest in the welfare of the
gallery, and more especially in making known the vital importance
of a gallery building.

An illustrated lecture prepared by the director, with the purpose
of making the gallery and its needs better known to the public, has
been widely presented. One copy with 75 lantern views, illustrating
the gallery’s collections, is in the hands of Mrs. J. W. Summers, of
Walla Walla, Wash., who has associated with her Mrs. Henry
Osterman, and has been utilized largely under the auspices of the
Federation of Women’s Clubs, principally in the State of Wash-
ington. A second copy (with seven additional slides), intrusted to
Miss Leila Mechlin, secretary of the American Federation of Arts,
and utilized under the auspices of that important organization, is
being very generally presented in the smaller cities and towns of the
United States; and a third copy (with 83 slides), placed in the
hands of Mrs. Rose V. S. Berry, chairman of the fine arts depart-
ment of the Federation of Woman’s Clubs, is being featured at the
meetings of that club throughout the country.

A recent act of Congress authorizes the raising of funds for the
erection of a national gallery building in the following language:
“'The Regents of the Smithsonian Institution are authorized to pre-
pare preliminary plans for a suitable fireproof building with granite
fronts for the National Gallery of Art, including the National Por-
trait Gallery and the history collections of the United States National

45
46 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Museum, said building to be erected when funds from gifts or
bequests are in the possession of the said Regents, in sections or com-
pletely on the north side of the Mall between the Natural History
Building, United States National Museum, and Seventh Street, leav-
ing a space between it and the latter of not less than one hundred
feet and a space of not less than one hundred feet between it and
Seventh Street, with its south front on a line with the south front
of the said Natural History Building.

A two-page leaflet on the national gallery has been issued, which,
like the recent leaflets on the Smithsonian Institution, is to have
a wide distribution. It is intended to bring forcibly to the atten-
tion of the public the great need for a separate building to house
the national art collections.

Detailed information regarding the growth of the gallery within
the institution and as a feature of the United States National
Museum may be found in Bulletin 70 of the National Museum, and
its subsequent activities are recorded in the annual reports of the
institution and Musuem and in the annual reports of the gallery for
the years 1921 and 1922.

In two articles prepared by the director and published in art
journals during the year attention is called to the growth of the
national gallery and to the great need for a gallery building. The
first, under the title “The Story of the National Gallery of Art,”
appeared in Art and Archeology for June, 1923. The story of the
National Gallery of Art from its beginning nearly a century ago
is the record of the prolonged struggle of the art idea for national
recognition for a place in the serious consideration of the American
people, and it is to be regetted that to-day, although art institu-
tions are springing up on all hands, art has slight national recogni-
tion beyond the attention necessary to the care and display of the
art treasures acquired by gift and bequest. For nearly a century
the Smithsonian Institution has harbored the dream of a gallery of
art, but art has been in the shadow of diversified scientific activities
and in the deeper shadow of the all-absorbing material interests of
a rapidly developing Nation. To-day the conditions are far from
satisfactory. Growth of the collections through gratuitous contri-
butions, even, is embarrassed by the almost complete exhaustion of
space for the reception and display of all save accessions of very
limited extent, and the problem before the institution, and certainly
with equal insistence before the American people, is “ Shall America
have a National Gallery of Art, or a National Museum of Art, that
will give us a respectable place among the cultured nations of the
world?” The story of the vicissitudes of the incipient, struggling
national gallery is here presented with the view of making known a
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 47

great national shortcoming and stirring the pride of a people not
accustomed to take a second or a third place in any field worthy of
their ambition.

The second, with the title “Shall America Have a National
Gallery of Art?” was published in The American Magazine of
Art for July, 1923. This article is a plea for recognition of the
claims of the incipient national gallery upon the American people
and seeks to determine and enlist the agencies that may be brought
to bear upon the erection of a gallery building.

The great importance of prompt action becomes apparent when
it is recalled that the failure to provide housing for possible ad-
ditions to the national collections means a great annual loss to the
national gallery—to the Nation. The yearly addition of art works
between 1905 and 1920, the latter the date of the complete ex-
haustion of gallery space in Museum buildings, averaged upward
of half a million a year, while the entire increase per year for the
three years since the latter date has fallen below $40,000. The loss
to the gallery and to the Nation at this rate, would, in a score of
years, amount to a sum equal to the erection of a building worthy
of the name, and there can be little doubt that if a gallery building
worthy of the name awaited the inflow of gifts and bequests,
accessions would reach the substantial figure of half a million per
year, as heretofore, or who shall say not twice that figure? Private
owners, seeking a final resting place for their treasures, would
doubtless, in many cases, prefer to be represented in a gallery be-
longing to the Nation, to all the people alike, than in any other.
Our plea, then, the plea of the Smithsonian Institution, is not only
a worthy but an urgent one, and is now made to all the people of
the Nation, and for all the people of the Nation.

THE GALLERY COMMISSION

In 1921, the Regents of the Institution organized a commission
which should devote its attention to the promotion of the gallery’s
interests in various directions, and the second annual meeting of
this commission was held in the Regents’ room of the Institution
on December 12, 1922. The members present were: Daniel Chester
French, chairman; W. K. Bixby; William H. Holmes, secretary
ex Officio; Gari Melchers; Charles Moore; James Parmelee; Edward
W. Redfield; Charles D. Walcott, ex officio. At this meeting numer-
ous important problems were considered and steps were taken to
enlist national interest in the gallery and its development as an in-
dispensable national institution.

The report of the secretary of*the commission for the year was
followed by reports of the standing, special, and subcommittees,
48 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Attention was given to the previously much-discussed project of an
important exhibition of portraits, official and lay, to be held in the
gallery, but satisfactory arrangements for holding the exhibit in
1923 could not be made. The question of appealing to Congress
for a building for art and history was considered and discussion
took place as to the feasibility of having the building project in-
cluded in the program being formulated by Congress for prospective
public buildings. Secretary Walcott brought to the attention of the
commission the question of the advisability of an appeal to American
institutions and to the American people for aid in the building
project. Following a discussion of the Ranger bequest fund and its
administration, the commission appointed a committee of three—
Messrs. E. W. Redfield, Gari Melchers, W. H. Holmes—to look after
the gallery’s interests in the final disposition of the purchases made
from this fund by the National Academy of Design.

With this meeting, the inital one year terms of three members of
the commission—Herbert Adams, Gari Melchers, Charles Moore—
expired, and the Board of Regents at its annual meeting, December
14, 1922, elected these persons to succeed themselves for the full term
of four years.

The art advisory committee appointed at the last meeting of the
Board of Regents, examined the several paintings and other works
offered to the gallery as permanent accessions. The following were
accepted :

“ Signing of the Treaty of Ghent,” an oil painting by Sir A. Forestier, 1914.
Presented by the Sulgrave Institution.

A cameo-cutter’s outfit, consisting of wheel, dies, tools, etc., which formerly

belonged to and was used by Louis Bonet, an engraver on fine stone. Pre-
sented by Paul W. Bartlett.

THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT COLLECTION

As announced in the report for last year, a number of influential
citizens, desiring to preserve some pictorial record of the World War,
organized a National Art Committee immediately after the close of
the war, and arranged with a number of our leading artists to
paint portraits of certain distinguished leaders of America and other
allied nations in the war with Germany. The members of the com-
mittee as organized are: Hon. Henry White (chairman) ; Herbert
L. Pratt (secretary and treasurer) ; Mrs. W. H. Crocker, Robert W.
de Forest, Abram Garfield, Mrs. E. H. Harriman, Arthur W.
Meeker, J. Pierpont Morgan, Charles P. Taft, Charles D. Walcott,
and Henry C. Frick (since deceased).

Under this arrangement, 21 portraits were painted and assembled
in the national walter y during the “month of May, 1921. Later these
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 49

were turned over to the American Federation of Arts for purposes
of public exhibition. Before their final return to their place in the
national portrait gallery, they were exhibited as follows:

That the gift of these portraits might be distinctly national in
character, it was decided that a group of two or more, financed by
the art patrons of any city, should be inscribed as presented to the
Nation by that city and that a representative of that city should be-
come an honorary member of the National Art Committee. It was
further decided that a tablet or other permanent record in the gallery
should bear the names of the National Art Committee, including the
chairmen of all local committees, and that there should be a record
of the name of each subscriber to the purchase fund.

The cities which, to date, have made presentations are as follows:

The collection of 21 portraits was returned to the gallery by the
American Federation of Arts on June 12, 1923, and was hung in the
central hall of the ground floor in direct connection with the great
body of exhibits pertaining to the war with Germany. On its return
to Washington the collection was enriched by the three-quarter
length portrait of Her Majesty Elizabeth, Queen of the Belgians, by
Jean McLean (Mrs. John C. Johnaaenhs the completion of which
had been delayed.

form of the catalogues of the art collections of the National Museum pre-
pared by former Assistant Secretary Rathbun (Bull. 70, U. S. N. M., 1916),
which was published, however, before the gallery became a separate de-
partment of the Institution. It contains an introduction by the director,
giving a brief account of the development of the art interests of the Institu-
tion and an outline of the organization of the gallery. This is followed by a
list of the art works acquired previous to November, 1921, with brief biog-
raphies of the artists. It is illustrated with a ground plan and full page
halftone plates of 25 of the most noteworthy of paintings and sculptures in
the gallery.

APPENDIX 3
REPORT ON THE FREER GALLERY OF ART

Sir: I have the honor to submit the third annual report on the
Freer Gallery of Art for the year ending June 30, 1923.

THE COLLECTION

Work completed during the year includes the examination, classi-
fication, and preliminary cataloguing of Chinese and Japanese stone
sculptures and jades begun in 1922. New work undertaken includes
the preliminary cataloguing and final. storage of Chinese and Japa-
nese bronzes, lacquers and wood sculptures, Near Eastern and
Egyptian pottery, and miscellaneous objects of bone, ivory, metal,
glass, etc., from various sources. Much additional work has been
done on the preservation of oil paintings, and one Chinese kakemono
has been remounted in panel form. The autumn, winter, and early
spring were largely devoted to the installation of exhibits and to
other preparations for the opening of the gallery to the public on
May 2, involving the construction of cases according to designs pre-
viously made, the designing of pedestals, special stands, mounts.
and easels and the execution of these under direct supervision of the
curator and the superintendent, the choice, exhibition, and labeling
of objects, the transfer of books to shelves provided for them in the
east study room, and the preparation of a brief pamphlet setting
forth the history of the Freer collection, together with necessary in-
formation regarding the purpose and use of the building and col-
lection. This pamphlet was given to visitors during the opening
week and has since been sold for 5 cents a copy, having reached a
second printing of 3,000 copies. In June the making of identifica-
tion photographs for the catalogue cards was begun.

BUILDING AND EQUIPMENT

Work accomplished during the year includes the completion of
several undertakings mentioned in the second annual report, such
as finishing gallery walls and floors, picture frames and screen boxes,
as well as many new tasks completed or begun and the inevitable re-

59
~

60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

pairs due to normal settling of the building and to ordinary wear
and tear. For the exhibition galleries, the workshop has turned out
52 cases, and has 12 others “in work” ; also 9 easels, 22 pedestals, 15
special stands, 40 block plinths, 5 large frames for screens, stone
sculptures and tiles, 100 reeded frames for etchings, 3 molded com-
position bases for stone sculptures, and 5 sets of barricade stands
have been made; while 6 walnut panels for the exhibition of scrolls
and 19 benches were contracted for and built outside. On the ground
floor, the east study room has been furnished with cork flooring,
bookcases, and a desk, the latter made in the workshop. The offices,
storage rooms, workrooms, and lavatories have received additional
equipment, including desk lights with necessary floor outlets, metal
shelving, cupboards, a set of portable shelves for photographic work,
glass door panels, extra locks, electric fans, etc. The fan room floor
has been painted, and in the attic blue size has been applied to the
skylights and cotton curtains have been hung above the ceiling lights
for the purpose of modifying both light and heat. In the cellar
two columns have been constructed under the partition wall between
two rooms in the northwest corner of the building. To the equip-
ment of the court fresh soil and a few trees have been added, as
well as three peafowl from the National Zoological Park and a
supply of goldfish from the Fish Commission. Indebtedness to these
two organizations is gratefully acknowledged.

OPENING AND ATTENDANCE

The formal opening of the gallery took place during the week of
May 2 to 8, inclusive. It was preceded by a “press view” on the
morning of May 1, and a private view for the Establishment and
Regents of the Smithsonian Institution on the afternoon of the same
day. For the opening week 3,300 invitations were issued.

Total attendance for May, 19,274.

Largest attendance on Sundays, averaging 1,022.

Smallest attendance on Mondays, averaging 406.

Total attendance for June, 13,474.

Largest attendance during the week of the Shriners’ convention,
1,158 and 1,202 on June 6 and 7, respectively, with an average attend-
ance of 548 on other days. Barns the rest of the month the largest
attendance was on Sundays, with an average of 490, and the smallest
on Mondays, with an average of 211.

Attendance in the study rooms for May and June, 186 persons, of
whom 4 brought in objects for examination and 11 received permis-
sion to copy.

Total attendance for May and June, 32, 648.

After June 11 a new regulation went into effect, namely, that the
building should be open from 9 until 4.30 every day of the week
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 61

except Monday, when it should be closed all day. This serves a
double purpose in that it not only makes the exhibitions available to
many people who are unable to come on week days, but also gives
opportunities for necessary work which can not be so well undertaken
when the building is open to visitors.

FIELD WORK
IN EUROPE

The months of July and August were spent by Miss Guest in
Europe and were devoted to a study of various collections of Oriental
art, following her attendance as delegate from this gallery to the
meetings of the Société Asiatique de Paris, held in Paris from July
10 to 18, in celebration of the centenary of Champollion. somone the
most important groups of objects studied were:

The collections of the Mission Pelliot, exhibited in the Musée
Guimet and the Musée du Louvre.

The partly dismantled but important loan exhibition of Oriental
pottery and stone sculpture at the Musée Cernuschi.

The collections of M. Raymond Koechlin and M. Calmann.

The Central Asian paintings collected by Sir Aurel Stein and de-
posited in the British Museum.

The objects from Turfan collected by Professor Von le Coq and
now stored in the Vélkerkunde Museum, and those from Samarra
collected by Dr. Friedrich Sarre and now exhibited in the Kaiser
Friedrich Museum, Berlin.

Miss Guest spent several days also in the pottery works of Staf-
fordshire, England, where she was given every facility for examining
materials and processes of manufacture.

Miss Guest’s more detailed account of her field activities accom-
panies this report as Appendix A (not printed).

IN CHINA

On February 12, Mr. Bishop left here for China, in charge of an
archeological expedition sent out under the joint auspices of the
Freer Gallery of Art and the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston. Work-
ing in accordance with instructions, but of necessity largely at his -
own discretion, Mr. Bishop’s chief concern so far has been with mat-
ters of organization, which he has managed and now settled more
successfully than might reasonably have been expected. He has also
visited several sites of great archeological interest and made observa-
tions of importance to the future work of the expedition.

Mr. Bishop’s detailed account of his field activities accompanies
this report as Appendix B (not printed).

APPENDIX 4
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY

Sir: In response to your request I have the honor to submit the
following report on the field researches, office work, and other opera-
tions of the Bureau of American Ethnology during the fiscal year
ended June 30, 1923, conducted in accordance with the act of Con-
gress approved June 12, 1923. The act referred to contains the fol-
lowing item:

American ethnology: For continuing ethnological researches among the
American Indians and the natives of Hawaii, including the excavation and
preservation of archeologic remains, under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution, including the necessary employees and the purchase of necessary
books and periodicals, $44,000.

The chief has endeavored to expend the sum of money allotted
in as conservative and economical a manner as possible, although
confronted with many difficulties, among which is the increased cost
of field work. Since the bureau was first organized expenses for its
maintenance have greatly increased, and have doubled within the
last 10 years. Several other tendencies of the times have limited
the production of results. There has been a great awakening of
interest in the treatment of certain Indian tribes by Government
officials which has led to a corresponding increase in requests for our
publications. Never before was there a greater demand for the
published reports and bulletins of the bureau. The epoch-making
discoveries in the Valley of the Tombs in Egypt have very greatly
increased interest in the Science of Man and the desire for more
accurate knowledge of prehistoric man in American is very keen.
Newspapers, magazines, and: other periodicals have done much to
increase this interest and, as may be said with regret, many fake dis-
coveries have been foisted on the public. Never before have accurate
accounts of Indian life like those published by the Bureau of Ameri-
can Ethnology been more in demand than at the present time.

Several wealthy institutions have been led to give more money to
American anthropology. Plans for archeological work in Yucatan
and Central America costing many thousands of dollars a year are
mentioned in some quarters, and many thousands are annually ex-
pended by another institution on pueblo archeology. For lack of
adequate funds, the bureau is unable to carry on extensive work of
this magnitude and it remains for the bureau to continue its work

63
64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

along the lines already successfully followed—by researches and pub-
lication of the results of less ambitious plans. It can not be expected
that the quantity of field work with this handicap can be as great
as it was when the field was almost untilled, but the chief is striving
to keep the quality up to the past. For years to come as the culture
of our aborigines fades into the past there will be plenty of work to
do in gathering survivals and publishing reports to meet increased
demand for authoritative literature on our aborigines. As the work
of the bureau calls for increased popularization, in the judgment
of the chief, the bureau should enlarge the number of popular
articles which it publishes from time to time without decreasing
strictly technical discoveries. The pages of our reports are full of
the records of discoveries which are little known and at present
interest only a few persons because of that fact. This should be
obviated by putting into published form, suitable for the layman
or for students in schools and colleges, the vast stores of knowledge
which have been made by the staff of the bureau and its collabo-
rators. The great success of the Handbook of American Indians
clearly indicates the desire of the people for popular information on
our aborigines and the bureau with an enlarged appropriation would
be able to continue work of this nature.

In compliance with the act of Congress above mentioned the Bu-
reau of American Ethnology has continued its field and office re-
searches on the American Indians including the ethnology of the
Hawaiian Islands, and the inhabitants of Porto Rico and the Virgin
Islands. Later in this report is a list of the annual publications.
The high cost of printing has somewhat reduced the quantity but the
quality has been maintained.

The rapid modification in aboriginal culture perceptible year by
year in Indian manners, customs, and languages has led the chief
of the bureau to encourage archeological and historical study of the
Indians. Extensive researches have been carried on in Colorado,
in the Harpeth Valley, Tenn., in the Ozarks, Mo., and on the
Atlantic seaboard. In addition to archeological research consider-
able work has been done on documentary history, especially of the
Creeks, Choctaws, and other Muskhogean tribes.

Although the bureau has hitherto published many memoirs on the
Indians of the northwest coast, there still remains much ethnologi-
_ cal work awaiting investigation in this territory. A very promising
beginning was made in the study of the totem poles of this region
by Dr. T. T. Waterman, a temporary assistant on the staff of the
bureau who made a special trip to Alaska for that purpose. He not
only collected considerable new material on totem poles but also on
legends connected with them.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 65

The intention of the chief is to continue the work thus inaugurated
in Alaska, and to repair one of the old Indian villages for educa-
tional purposes. The former houses of the Alaska natives are now
rapidly going to destruction; Kasaan, one of the largest, was de-
serted and has been made a national monument but is suffering for
want of care. It is proposed to begin cleaning up this village, re-
pair it, in order to minimize the dangers from fire and vandals, and
put it in a condition to afford the greatest educational value to
future students and tourists.

The first duty of the chief being administrative in nature much of
his time is taken up by details of office work, in which, unless assisted
by the members of the bureau, he would be greatly handicapped.
The work of answering letters has greatly increased in the last five
years, and the demands on the time of those engaged in it have been
greatly multipled. This has affected all members of the staff, but
it is very satisfactory to record that the letters in reply to inquiries
are treated with the greatest respect and are looked upon as authori-
tative by the recipients.

When in Washington the chief has attended all meetings of the ad-
visory committee on publications and one or two other committees to
which he has been appointed. He has likewise accepted the welcome ~
duty of keeping in touch with all the archeological expeditions from
different institutions working on ruins in the area of the United
States in order that he might intelligently advise action to the sec-
retary on the requests for permits to carry on archeological excava-
tions, which each year are increasing in numbers.

The chief has made strenuous efforts to continue his studies of
previous summers on the Mesa Verde National Park in cooperation
with the National Park Service of the Department of the Interior.
In July, August, and a part of September he was absent from Wash-
ington and completed the excavation of Pipe Shrine House, a build-
ing in the Mummy Lake group of mounds. An account of the initia-
tion of this work appeared in the report for last year. This excep-
tional ruin was completely repaired and is now open for inspection
of visitors.

The excavation and repair of a circular tower situated 300 feet
from Far View House also engaged his attention from the middle
of July until the close of the season. The mound of stones cover-
ing this ruin was known as far back as 1915, but its hidden building
was not revealed until the close of June of the summer of 1922, when
it was found to be a tower with three subterranean rooms, called
kivas, which were evidently used for ceremonial purposes. Around
these rooms was formerly a crowded cemetery, of ancient date,
which led him to regard the whole area as a necropolis. The number
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

of interments was too large for the number of dwellings. The three
kivas belong to the highest type of these structures characteristic of
the Mesa Verde. In one of them there was a well-made wall of
secondary construction showing a secondary occupation and ruder
masonry. This kiva showed signs of having been abandoned and
later reoccupied, but how many years elapsed between the two occu-
pations was not evident from data available.

The excavation of this Mesa Verde tower led to new ideas of the
structure and use of these remains, hundreds of which are found
scattered in the canyons and on the mesas of the northern tributaries
of the upper San Juan River. This tower is a fair example of the
type of these buildings. It was probably an outlook for observations
of the sun and ceremonies connected with the sky god.

The first type of tower recognized in the Mesa Verde is a simple
lookout situated naturally on the summit of a hill or high elevation,
but unaccompanied by any other building; the second type has basal
rooms which apparently are used for storage of food or possibly
for habitation. Far View Tower is classified in a third type, in
which we have a tower rising from basal subterranean kivas,
granaries, and dwellings. The purpose of this type of tower is the
same as Pipe Shrine House.

During the greater part of August the tops of the walls of Far
View House were covered with cement to protect them from the
elements, and it is believed the protected walls will remain upright
for several years without further repair. The permanent protection
of these open ruins is always difficult and costly, but necessary.
There still remain many unsolved problems on the Mesa Verde
awaiting attention, but with small appropriations new ruins can not
be opened and those already opened can not be repaired.

Some distance north of Far View Tower is the depression long
ago christened Mummy Lake. Its true nature is unknown, though
it may have been a reservoir; but no mummies have ever been found
in its vicinity. In the thick cedars about it, situated on the right
hand of the road, there are several small mounds indicating ruins.
generally habitations, surrounding kivas. In one of these there are
walls made of large stones set on edge, standing above ground.
These stones project 4 feet above the surface, and their size has led
to the ruin being called Megalithic House. Excavation work on
this ruin was begun but not completed before the appropriation was
exhausted.

About every other night during the five months the chief worked
on the Mesa Verde he gave camp-fire talks to visitors and spent
considerable time daily in explaining the signification of the excava-
tions while they were in progress.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 67

In June, 1928, the chief made a trip to Deming, southern New
Mexico, and visited different localities, Fort Bayard, Central, Silver
City, and Pinos Altos, where pictured food bowls have been found.
He purchased a beautiful collection of pottery from the Mimbres
Valley, which supplements that already installed in the Museum.

In 1914 the chief first pointed out that the Mimbres Valley, in
which this pottery is found, was inhabited in prehistoric times by
a people who excelled all other pueblos in painting realistic figures
on pottery. The scientific value of these pictures is very great from
the fact that the prehistoric dwellers in the Mimbres Valley in this
way left a reliable and permanent record of certain occupations
(hunting, fishing, gambling), as well as wonderful representations
of mythological animals of all varieties. If we could truthfully
interpret these figures, our knowledge of the prehistoric mythology
of a people of whose history, language, and relationship we know
nothirig from documentary sources would be greatly increased.

Not far from the close of the fiscal year, President Harding issued
a proclamation declaring three’ groups of towers in southwestern
Colorado and southeastern Utah to be a national monument. This
announcement was particularly gratifying to the chief, not only
because it preserved for future generations good examples of unique
types of ancient buildings in our southwest but also because the idea
of the reservation of Hovenweep National Monument originated in
the Bureau of American Ethnology. The three groups composing
this monument lie within a few miles of each other and are locally
called Ruin Canyon group, Holly Canyon group, and the Tejon
Mesa group.

During the fiscal year Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, has com-
pleted the following manuscripts: “ Social Organization and Social
Usages of the Indians of the Creek Confederacy ”; “ Religious Be-
liefs and Medical Practices of the Creek Indians”; and “A Gram-
matical Sketch of the Alabama Language.”

Doctor Swanton also completed a card catalogue, arranged under
stems, of all of the linguistic material contained in the Arte de la
Lengua Timuquana, by Francisco Pareja, and an English-Indian
index for the same; and initiated a report on the stories of the south-
eastern Indians. By July 1 he had completed translations of stories
in the Koasati language and made a beginning on those in Alabama.
Material was added to his collection of references bearing on the
economic basis of American Indian life, and some map work was
done in connection with this phase of Indian life.

The ist of July, 1923, found Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist,
at work among the Fox Indians of Iowa. He collected sufficient
material for a manuscript entitled “ The traditional origin of the
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Fox Society, known as ‘They who go about singing’ (singing-
around rite).” This material will be published in the Fortieth
Annual Report of the bureau. A good beginning was also made on
the ceremonial “runners” and attendants. ‘Tribal dissensions at
Tama cut short Doctor Michelson’s stay among the Fox Indians and
he made a reconnaissance among the Potawatomi of Wisconsin, the
Chippewa at Reserve in the same State, the Ottawa of Michigan, the _
Delaware-Munsee of Lower Canada, and the Montagnais of Lake
St. John, returning to Washington near the 1st of October. He
definitely determined that there are several different Delaware dia-
lects spoken in Canada and the United States, and that some of these
dialects are not clearly related; so that the word Delaware is merely
a “catch all” term.

After returning to Washington Doctor Michelson devoted his time
to elaborating the paper above mentioned on “ The traditional origin
of the Fox Society, known as ‘ The Singing-around rite ’,” complet-
ing it for publication.

About the middle of May Doctor Michelson left for the field to
make a reconnaissance of the Algonquin tribes of eastern United
States and Canada, including the Labrador Peninsula. His obser-
vations lead him to conclude that the aboriginal culture of the
Penobscots at Old Town, Me., is disintegrating. None of the young
people speak the language, and with the constant intermarrying
with whites it will be but a short time when ethnology and folklore,
which are both well remembered, will be a thing of the past. The
Malecites living at the “village,” about 12 miles from Fredericton,
New Brunswick, cling tenaciously to the language, which is spoken
universally, though practically everyone also has a good command
of English. Their ethnology, on the other hand, is fast disappear-
ing. During his short visit with the Penobscots and Malecites,
Doctor Michelson determined a number of peculiar morphological
traits of the language as compared with central Algonquian. He
finds the phonetics of both languages extremely difficult, and on the
whole it may be said that neither language is archaic in type. On
June 13 Doctor Michelson arrived in Sydney Cape Breton, Nova
Scotia, en route to Labrador.

The beginning of the fiscal year found Mr. John P. Harrington,
ethnologist, engaged in the preparation for publication of his recent
field notes on the Picuris and Taos tribes of New Mexico and the
Mission Indians of California. All the notes on the Taos Indians
collected by the late Mrs. M. C. Stevenson were copied and arranged
for publication.

Mr. Harrington also prepared for publication a paper entitled
“ Picuris Children’s Stories with Texts and Songs.” This manu-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 69

script embraces Picuris stories in native text such as are told to the
Indian children on winter evenings in their little isolated village in
northern New Mexico. The stories have high literary quality, and
many of them hold the attention of child or adult throughout. The
volume is thought to be practical for school use. The 12 songs ac-
companying the stories are beautifully rendered by Mr. Rosendo
Vargas, and are transcribed into musical notation by Miss H. H.
Roberts.

Mr. Harrington also prepared an article on “ How the World
Grew,” which is an account of origins corresponding to the book of
Genesis of the Bible obtained from the Mission Indians of California.

Mr. Cipriano Alvarado, a Quiché Indian of the highlands of
Guatemala, was brought to this country for the purpose of ling?fstic
study by Mr. William Gates, who kindly allowed Mr. Harrington to
obtain from him a large amount of text material in this language.
The Quiché is the direct descendant of the tongue of the ancient
temple builders of the Central American jungles. In working with
Mr. Alvarado with the kymograph, Mr. Harrington discovered that
the Quiché and other Mayan dialects possess tones exactly like those
of Chinese, and that these tones, as in the latter language, are often
the sole means of distinguishing words that are otherwise pho-
netically identical. Work was also done with Mr. Alvarado and
Mr. Gates on the pallophotophone, a machine recently invented by
Professor Hoxie, of the General Electric Co. The pallophotophone
proved of the greatest value for the study of tones in Indian and
other languages, and its reproduction of the voice is true for all the
sounds, even including s, h, and those of like timbre which are im-
perfectly rendered on the phonograph.

On May 3 Mr. Harrington proceeded to Santa Barbara, Calif., for
the purpose of continuing his researches on the Indians of that State.
He succeeded in finding good informants for Indian songs as well as
stories and place names and obtained a large quantity of manuscript
material. This material consists of myths, place names, historical
notes, accounts of early life and customs, genealogies, and Indian
songs.

The Bureau of American Ethnology is doing cooperative work
with the Museum of the American Indian, Heye Foundation, of New
York City, which obtained permission from the Hotel Ambassador
Corporation to excavate the famous Burton Mound on the beach at
Santa Barbara. This mound has always been known as the site of
the principal rancheria of the Santa Barbara Indians, but former
owners of the property refused permission to excavate it, and when
the Potter Hotel was erected in 1901 hope of archaeological investi-
gation seemed forever lost. The site was unexpectedly made again
- -
70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

available for study on account of the burning of the hotel a few
years ago.

The excavations began early in May and the Indian cemetery was
located on the slope of the mound toward the beach. The graves
that were opened were crowded with human bodies, trinkets, and a
great variety of utensils. Among the specimens are a fragment of a
soapstone canoe, soapstone pipes, fishhooks of abalone and bone,
sinker stones, arrowheads of great variety, spear heads, about 40
mortars, pestles, including some very long ones, beads of many kinds,
pendants, daggers, bowls and kettles of soapstone, native paint, ete.

Mr. Harrington has prepared for publication during the fiscal
year approximately 1,900 pages of manuscript.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, completed during the fiscal year
the second part of his Iroquoian Cosmology, the first part having
appeared in the Twenty-first Annual Report of the bureau. ;

During the year Mr. Hewitt spent some time editing a manu-
script entitled “ Report on the Indian Tribes of the Upper Missouri,”
by Mr. Edwin Thompson Denig, to the Hon. Isaac Stevens, Governor
of Washington Territory in 1854 (?), which has been submitted for
publication.

Mr. Hewitt devoted much time and research in the preparation of
data for official replies to correspondents of the bureau. These in-
quiries in their scope touch almost the entire range of human interest,
very often seeking information quite outside of the specific field of
research belonging to this bureau. About 100 such replies were pre-
pared, although some of them required more than a day’s work in
preparation.

Mr. Hewitt also acted as the representative of the Smithsonian
Institution on the United States Board of Geographic Names.

On May 18, 1923, Mr. Hewitt left Washington on field duty. His
destination was the Grand River Grant to the Six Nations of Iro-
quois dwelling near Brantford, Ontario, Canada. At this place
Mr. Hewitt made an intensive study and revision and fuller inter-
pretation of his voluminous texts—texts which he had recorded so
fortunately in previous visits to this place. These texts embody the
traditions of the founding of the League or Confederation of the
Five Tribes of the Iroquois in the closing decades of the sixteenth
century. They contain also the principles and laws upon which it
was established, as well as the complete rituals and chants of the
Council of Condolence and Installation of the Federal Government,

was established, as well as the complete rituals and chants of the
kindreds composing the tribal members of the league.

He was also fortunate in recovering enough data relating to the
Federal and tribal chieftainesses to enable him to affirm the former
existence of a set of official names for every one of these women
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 71

magistrates. He also recorded much valuable information relating
to the several institutions of the league.

On June 24, Mr. Hewitt made a short visit to the Onondaga
Reservation, lying about 8 miles south of Syracuse, N. Y. He de-
voted his time on this reservation to a comparison of the limited
knowledge possessed by the only two men who had any definite
information of the various institutions and laws and installation
rituals of the Iroquois Confederation, with the records which he
possesses. The object was to ascertain, if still possible, how much
of his Canadian material, if any, could be said to be recent, or
whether the differences in the content were due merely to the break-
down of the traditions of the New York Onondaga. He convinced
himself that the latter was the sole cause.

Mr. Francis La Flesche, ethnologist, was engaged most of the time
during the fiscal year in assembling his notes for the third volume
of his work on The Osage Tribe. In this volume are recorded
two rituals of the Osage tribal rites. One is entitled Wa-xo’-be
A-wa-tho*, Singing of the Wa-xo’-be Songs, and the other, Ca Tha-ce
Ga-xe, Weaving of the Rush.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES

In her studies of Indian music during the fiscal year Miss Frances
Densmore has included the songs of three tribes living in Arizona,
near the Mexican border. These tribes are the Yuma, Mohave, and
Papago. One of the manuscripts submitted this year deals with the
cremation ceremony of the Yuma, witnessed by Miss Densmore in
1922. The ceremonial songs of this rite were recorded and informa-
tion given by the oldest man, who has the hereditary right to sing
these songs. It is the custom of the Yuma Indians to hold a
memorial ceremony within a year after a death, at which an image
of the deceased is burned. After this ceremony the name of the
dead is never spoken. A full description of this ceremony was sub-
mitted, together with transcriptions of its songs.

The treatment of the sick by these tribes was also studied and
healing songs of each tribe were submitted. Among these were the
songs of a Yuma medicine man, who claims the power to cure per-
sons suffering from wounds in the chest, accompanied by hemor-
rhage. This shaman said that he did this by the aid of four insects
and birds, one of which has power over the fluids of the body. His
songs are cheerful and soothing in character, and it is interesting
to note that he forbade the people to weep during his treatment,
requiring that they “appear cheerful and act in a natural manner.”

Four manuscripts were submitted by Miss Densmore during the
year, bearing the following titles: “ Papago medicine and dancing
72 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

songs,” “ Dream and war songs of the Papago Indians,” “ Cremation
and memorial ceremonies of the Yuma Indians, with related songs,”
and “Lightning and medicine songs of the Yuma and Mohave In-
dians.” This material comprised 93 pages of manuscript and 84
transcriptions of songs, together with the original phonographic
records and tabulated and descriptive analyses of the songs. The
two most interesting musical discoveries made in this work are the
presence in these tribes of songs which may be termd “ pure melody
without tonality,” and the independent and elaborated rhythm of
the accompanying instrument, either a gourd rattle or a basket drum.
In many instances the accompanying instrument is transcribed sep-
arately from the melody in order to show its peculiarities.

During the summer of 1922 Miss Densmore visited the Chippewa
reservations at Lac Court Oreilles, Wis., and Leech Lake and Mille
Lac, Minn., collecting additional specimens of plants used in treating
the sick, and other data.

In the spring of 1923 Mr. W. E. Myer, special archeologist, spent
several months investigating archeological remains in central Ten-
nessee. He visited the ancient mound group of the Banks Link farm
on Duck River, in Humphreys County, Tenn., where was found the
celebrated cache of fine, long flint blades and other flint objects now
the pride of the collection of the Missouri Historical Society. He
made a map of this group and obtained additional information in
regard to these masterpieces of the ancient flint-chipper’s art.

Through the active aid of several citizens of Lincoln County he
was enabled to visit and study an important arid hitherto undescribed
mound group on Elk River, at the junction of Lincoln, Moore, and
Franklin Counties. He also obtained the definite location of over
75 unrecorded sites on which ancient man had lived in Lincoln
County.

He explored a small burial mound and other vestiges of an ancient
Indian village on the lands of Mr. L. W. Denny, Goodlettsville,
Davidson County, Tenn., where he found 20 skeletons. There was
evidence that two different tribes had occupied this site at separate
times in the past, and the mound yielded a number of fine artifacts
which throw light on the life of the people.

Mr. Myer spent two months exploring the remains of a great pre-
historic fortified Indian town in Cheatham County, Tenn., known as
the Great Mound Group on account of its great central mound.
With the assistance of Mr. Wilbur Nelson, State geologist of Tennes-
see, an excellent topographical map was made, and through the re-
peated efforts of Lieut. Norman McEwen, of the 136th Air Squadron,
Tennessee National Guard, some good airplane photographs of the
mound on the Harpeth River, near Kingston Springs, were secured.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 73

These remains cover approximately 500 acres in two bends of the
river. In one bend he found a bold projecting hill which had been
artificially shaped from bottom to top. Three wide terraces had been
formed along the side of this hill. The original rounded summit had
been leveled until a great plaza or public square, about 1,000 feet in
length and 500 feet in breadth, had been formed. Upon the sides
of this level plaza one very large mound and two smaller ones had
been erected. This section of the ancient town was protected on the
water side by the perpendicular cliffs of the Harpeth River. On
the land side it was defended by an earthen embankment or breast-
works surmounted by a wooden wall, from which at intervals semi-
circular wooden towers projected. These earthen breastworks, which
had formerly supported this wooden wall, were still to be found in
the undisturbed woodlands, where they yet extend about 114 miles,
and there is evidence that they originally ran much farther. Wooden
palisades, consisting of small tree trunks, had been driven into the
ground side by side and wedged together and the soil thrown against _
them until they were by this means firmly embedded in these earthen
embankments or breastworks. These palisades, bound closely
together and strongly braced, formed a wooden wall which had been
plastered on the outside in order to make scaling by an enemy
difficult. Earthen bastions projecting beyond this line of wall at
intervals of about 150 yards were still to be found. These had
formerly supported the semicircular wooden towers. The enemy
advancing to attack was therefore subjected to fire from the de-
fenders through portholes along the main wall and also to a flanking
fire from the warriors in the towers on these bastions. Faint traces
of some of the timbers of these palisades and wooden towers were
found in the soil of these embankments.

While the great central mount and terraced hill formed the most
striking feature of this ancient town, there were in the inclosure four
other eminences whose summits had likewise been leveled into plazas.
All these plazas yielded traces of earth lodges and other evidences of
former buildings. The earth lodges of the common people were
situated on the edges of the terraces. The larger mounds had prob-
ably supported important public buildings and the lodges of leading
personages. This grouping of important buildings around five sep-
arate plazas and in different parts of the town very probably indi-
cates that the population was made up of what had once been
four or five separate autonomous groups of kindred peoples. Here in
their later home each group had gathered around their own public
square in their own section of the town and thus preserved at least
some of their old ceremonials and held together in some fashion their
old organization.
74 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

It is impossible to determine even approximately the number of
inhabitants, but the large number of the buildings and the long ex-
tent of the walls indicate a population of several thousand. All the
buildings whose traces were uncovered appear to have been burned.
Below the fallen-in wall of an important building the charred re-
mains of the woven reed tapestry which had formerly hung upon
the wall were secured for the National Museum.

It is not as yet possible to determine the age of these remains.
Beyond all question this town had been destroyed long before the
coming of the whites. No object of white man’s manufacture was
found on this site.

Mr. Gerard Fowke carried on archeological investigations in the
Stratman Cave in Maries County, Mo. This cave, which is situated
a little more than 2 miles south of Gascondy, the point at which the
Rock Island Railroad crosses Gasconade River, has an opening on
the side of a hill about 150 feet high. The approach to the cave on
the river side is very steep, but from the top of the hill it is less
difficult. Mr. Fowke opened a trench on the outside slope of the
talus at a point 30 feet from the entrance of the cave and 16 feet
below the fioor level. He found most of the evidences of human
occupation in superficial black earth, scattered throughout which
from bottom to top were fragments of pottery, parts of vessels of
varying capacity and thickness; chert knives or spearheads, none
highly finished; hundreds of thousands of mussel shells more or less
decayed; and other objects so abundantly found on the numerous
camp sites and village sites along the Gasconade River. The arti-
facts were few in number and scattered throughout the mass,
nowhere more than a few pieces in a cubic foot of earth. This
denotes temporary occupation, at irregular intervals, over a long
period of time. Yet the cave was not altogether merely a resort for
temporary hunters or war parties. In addition to the pottery, which
shows at least occasional sojourning in the cave, there were frag-
mentary bones,.too fragile to preserve, of a child 2 or 3 years old,
of another somewhat older, and a small adult, possibly a woman.
These bones were found in different places but near the surface;
there were no other indications of burials. The only specimens
found worthy of note were a small hammer made of a chert twin-
concretion and bearing evidence of long service; a pebble, used for
sharpening small bone implements and for smoothing leather or
rawhide strings; and a double concave discoidal with V-shaped
margin.

While the results of the work at Stratman Cave contributed
little to the antiquity of man in Missouri, Mr. Fowke’s studies, which
are accompanied by a small collection, are valuable in a comparative
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY TA

way. The Ozark region in Missouri is yielding many surprises to
the archeologist and it is believed that there still remains much
field work to be done here-and in the neighborhood before the char-
acter and antiquity of the ®ndians of that region are definitely
determined.

With a small appropriation Mr. John L. Baer carried on instruc-
tive field studies on the banner stones in the Susquehanna River
region, and was able to make a good series reaching from the imper-
fect form into the more symmetrical objects. He also investigated
the pictographs found near Delta, Pa.

In November of last year Mr. Gill began to reclassify the large
collection of ethnologic and archeologic negatives with a view of
preparing a comprehensive catalogue of the linguistic families and
tribes with such historic data as is available. He has made good —
progress in this work. About 5,000 negatives have already been
catalogued.

LIBRARY

The reference library continued under the immediate care of Miss
Ella Leary, librarian, assisted by Mr. Roderick McPherson and later
by Mr. Thomas Blackwell.

During the year 500 books were accessioned. Of these 70 were
acquired by purchase, 130 by gift and exchange, and 300 by binding
of periodicals. The current periodicals annually received number
about 925, of which 35 are by subscription, the remainder being
obtained through exchange. The bureau has also received 200
pamphlets. The aggregate number of volumes in the library at the
close of the year was 25,061; of pamphlets about 15,100.. Satisfactory
progress was made toward the completion of the new subject cata-
logue from the old imperfect author’s catalogue.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY , fut

The most pressing need which confronts the library is shelving
for the ever increasing accumulations of books. Extensive shift-
ings and readjustments have been necessary during the year in order
to make space available where it is most needed, but the library is
totally lacking in facilities to allow for its expansion.

COLLECTIONS

The following collections, acquired by members of the bureau or
by those detailed in connection with its researches, have been trans-
ferred to the United States National Museum:

69367. Archeological objects from Alaska collected by Dr. T. T. Waterman in the

spring of 1922. (5 specimens.)

69530. Stone collar from Mayaguez, Porto Rico.

69660. Two incense burners found in a cave in southern Yucatan and presented
to the bureau by Maj. E. H. Ropes, United States Army.

69881. Archeological specimens collected along the Susquehanna River (Mary-
land and Pennsylvania) in October, 1922, by John L. Baer. (174
specimens. )

69885. Two stone pestles from the Isle of Pines.

MISCELLANEOUS

Clerical_—The correspondence and other clerical work of the office
has been conducted by Miss May S. Clark, clerk to the chief. Mr.
Anthony W. Wilding served as messenger and typist to the chief.

Mr. Roderick McPherson, messenger in the library, resigned March
31, 1928, and Mr. Thomas Blackwell, minor clerk, was appointed
May 1 to fill the vacancy.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 5
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the International Exchange Service during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1923:

The work of the service having returned to a normal basis, an
estimate of $45,000 was submitted for carrying on the exchanges
during the year, which is $5,000 less than that appropriated for the
fiscal year 1922. This appropriation was made by Congress and in
addition $200 was allowed for printing and binding. The repay-
ments from departmental and other establishments amounted to
$5,263.66, making the total resources available during the year,
$50,463.66. ;

The total number of packages handled during the past 12 months
was 377,826, a decrease from the number for the preceding year of
5,831. The total weight of these packages was 492,816 pounds, a
decrease of 99,784. This large decrease in the weight was due to
the fact that many of the packages sent abroad contained small
publications.

The number and weight of the packages of different classes are
indicated in the following table:

Although it is true that the United States Government sends
abroad more publications than it receives in exchange, the disparity
is not so great as appears in the table, for many foreign publica-
tions are forwarded by mail to the addresses in this country without
passing through the exchanges.

78
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 719

It was stated in the last report that the Government of Rumania
had been approached with a view to the reopening of exchange re-
lations with that country, and further that the Institution had ar-
ranged directly with the Institutul Meteorologic Central, at Buk-
harest, to take charge of the forwarding and distributing of exchange
consignments. During the past year a communication has been re-
ceived through the Department of State from the Government of
Rumania to the effect that the above-mentioned institute had been
designated as the official Rumanian Exchange Bureau. <A note was
received from Rumania, through the Relgian Government, stating
that under date of June 5, 1923, the Rumanian Government had
declared its adherence to the Brussels Conventions of 1886, pro-
viding for the exchange of official documents and scientific and lit-
erary publications and the immediate exchange of the official journal.
For a number of years the exchange of official documents has been
conducted with Rumania, although that country has only recently
given its formal adherence to the conventions.

The conditions in Russia ‘and Turkey have not yet improved
sufficiently to warrant the Institution in taking steps to establish
official exchange bureaus in those countries. The Institution has,
however, arranged with the American Friends Service Committee
to forward to Russia the large accumulations of scientific and literary
publications for correspondents in that country. Two consignments,
comprising a total of 70 boxes, have thus far been forwarded to
Russia in this way. The Academy of Sciences in Petrograd is act-
ing as the distributing agency.

There were shipped abroad during the year 2,223 boxes, being a
decrease of 995 from the number for the preceding 12 months. This
decrease in the number of boxes forwarded abroad, in comparison
with the number shipped during the previous year, is due partly
to the smaller size of many of the publications, to which reference
has already been made, and partly to the fact that the number of

boxes sent abroad last year was the largest in the history of the
' service, the usual number being about 2,400 annually. Moreover,
packages for certain countries were sent direct to their destination by
mail, owing to the fact that a suflicient number had not accumulated
to make box shipments when the regular monthly consignments
would have been forwarded. About 40,000 packages were forwarded
in this manner during the year.

Of the total number of boxes sent abroad 214 contained full sets
of. United States official documents for foreign depositories and 2,009
included departmental and other publications for the depositories
of partial sets and for miscellaneous correspondents.

APPENDIX 6
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1923:

Since the expenses of the National Zoological Park, like those
of some other activities of the Federal Government, are borne in
part by the District of Columbia, the Bureau of the Budget has,
with the initiation of the budget law and for purposes of accounting,
included the estimates of the park within the District bill. The
act making appropriations for the Government of the District
of Columbia and other activities chargeable in whole or in part
against the revenue of such District, approved June 29, 1922, con-
tained an item of $125,000 for the regular maintenance of the park.
As an addition to the continuing appropriations available from
former years for the purchase of land near the Adams Mill Road
entrance, there was appropriated by Congress in the second defi-
ciency bill approved January 22, 1923, the sum of $3,096.34 to
complete the sum of $8,000 necessary for the termination of this
purchase. The bill providing for printing and binding, Smithsonian
Institution, contained an allotment of $300 for the National Zoologi-
cal Park. This was an increase of $100 over former allotments,
which had, during recent years, been insufficient for the needs of the
park.

Considerable progress has been made during the year in the work
of preparing for use the area between the great flight cage and the
main road in the western part of the park. This work was begun
* seven years ago but was discontinued during the war. Other minor
repairs and improvements have been made, and much effort has been
expended in beautifying the grounds, particularly in the parts of
the park most used by the public. The value of the collection is
greater than ever before; more species of animals are on exhibition
and the actual number of specimens of all kinds is greater than in
any previous year. Attendance records, for the fourth successive
year, have exceeded 2,000,000 visitors.

ACCESSIONS

Gifts—The number of animals presented by friends of the park
shows continued and gratifying increase from year to year. During
the past year 266 specimens were thus added to the collection. Many

87
88 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

of these are of particular value and, as in the previous year, special
mention should be made of important contributions from tropical
America.

Hon. Henry D. Baker, American consul at Trinidad, West Indies,
and Mr. William J. La Varre, of Georgetown, British Guiana, both
continued their gifts of South American animals. Interesting birds,
mammals, and reptiles were received from Mr. Baker, and included
in the collections made by Mr. La Varre were two fine specimens of
the dusky parrot (Pionus fuscus), a species of special interest to
the park. Mr. Gordon MacCreagh, of New York City, collected
and presented a specimen of the Brazilian red ouakari monkey
(Cacajao yubicundus), a species rarely seen in captivity and never
before represented, apparently, in any zoological garden in the
United States. Like the other members of its genus this monkey
is very difficult to keep, but this specimen presented by Mr. Mac-
Creagh lived in the park from August 25, 1922, until April 24, 1923.
a period of eight months. Among other animals from Mr. Mac-
Creagh was a specimen of the matamata turtle (Chelys fimbriata).

Dr. William M. Mann, of the Bureau of Entomology, while en-
gaged in work in southern Mexico, collected for the park a number of
interesting animals. Of special interest in Doctor Mann’s collec-
tion are two Mexican spider monkeys, four Maw’s turtles, and eight
specimens of Petz’s paroquet. The turtle and the paroquet are
species new to the park records. Dr. C. Bonne, of Moengo, Surinam,
presented to the park a fine young tapir; and Mr. C. E. Bergman, of
Norfolk, Va., contributed a specimen of the Magellan fox from
Chile, a species not before shown in the park.

The Canadian Government, through Hon. J. B. Harkin, Com-

Births—During the year 51 mammals were born and 29 birds
were hatched in the park. ‘These records include only such as are
reared to a reasonable age, no account being made in these published
statistics of young that live only a few days. Mammals born include:
European bear, 3; lion, 3; dingo, 3; gray wolf, 4; raccoon, 2; moun-
tain goat, 1; tahr, 1; bison, 2; Indian buffalo, 1; guanaco, 2; llama,
2; red deer, 7; American elk, 2; barasingha, 1; Japanese deer, 6;
hog deer, 1; Virginia deer, 2; Trinidad agouti, 1; rhesus monkey, 2;
mona, 1; rufus-bellied wallaby, 3; great red kangaroo, 1. Birds
hatched were of the following species: Mallard, black duck, wood
duck, silver pheasant, peafowl, and black-crowned night heron.

Exchanges.—Specimens received in exchange for surplus stock
include 27 mammals and 21 birds. Special mention should be made of
two Greenland musk oxen imported by way of Norway, the first ever
to be shown in the park; two mouflions, the wild sheep of Corsica and
Sardinia; a fine male nilgai from India; a clouded leopard, marbled
cat (Felis marmorata), and fire cat (Adlurin planiceps) from Su-
matra; a male panda from India; 2 black and 2 fulvous lemurs; and
a two-toed sloth. Birds received in exchange include, besides other
more common species, 3 kagus, 2 Victoria crowned pigeons, 3 black-
head ibises, 2 faleated ducks, and 2 eagle owls.

Purchases.—Among the mammals purchased during the year were
2 Alaska Peninsula bear cubs, 2 Alaskan black-tailed deer, an
ocelot, and 2 otters. Birds purchased include some very desirable
specimens: 2 Marquesan doves, 2 red-breasted mergansers, 2 sooty
shearwaters, 4 wood ibises, and a gannet. A number of more common
water birds, cage birds, eagles, and owls, as well as a number of
reptiles, were also acquired by purchase.

Transfers—Among the animals received by transfer from other
Government departments special mention should be made of a ship-
ment of 36 specimens of the Laysan finch, collected by Dr. Alexander
Wetmore while engaged in work for the Biological Survey, Depart-
ment of Agriculture, on the island bird reservations west of Hawaii.
The Laysan “finch” (Zelespyza cantans) is a member of an inter-
esting family of birds that is restricted to the Hawaiian Islands.
The specimens sent by Doctor Wetmore were all collected on Midway
Island. Some wood ducks, canvasbacks, and a collared lizard were
#lso received by transfer from the Biological Survey.
92 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

The Bureau of Fisheries, Department of Commerce, donated a
collection of 18 snakes of 5 species that were collected by Mr. F. E.
Hare at the biological station, Manchester, Iowa.

REMOVALS

Surplus mammals and birds to the number of 66 were sent away
during the year in exchange to other zoological gardens. Among
these were the following mammals that had been born and reared in
the park: Siberian tiger, 4; dingo, 1; red deer, 8; barasingha, 3;
hog deer, 2; Rocky Mountain sheep, 1; bison, 1; hippopotamus, 1;
Trinidad agouti, 2; rhesus monkey, 1.

A number of animals on deposit were returned to owners.

The death rate has again been kept at a very low mark. Except
for the loss of nine kangaroos from necrobacillosis, there has been no
evidence of contagion among the animals. Some of the losses of
animals long in the collection are as follows: A sandhill crane
(Grus mexicana) received January 30, 1899, died April 17, 1923,
from enteritis, after 24 years, 2 months, and 18 days in the park.
The great black-backed gull, “ Billy,” well known to thousands of
park visitors because of his long residence and sociable nature, died
April 18, 1923. “ Billy” came to the park from Labrador on No-
vember 22, 1905, and had thus been on exhibition for 17 years, 4
months, and 22 days. A male of the northern wild cat (Lynx uinta)
received September 3, 1907, died of old age on December 30, 1922,
15 years, 3 months, and 27 days after his arrival. A female guanaco
received January 20, 1908, died of disseminated tumors, after 14
years, 8 months, and 26 days in the park, on October 16, 1922. The
South American condor, male, received October 31, 1908, died June
15, 1923, 14 years, 7 months, and 15 days after arrival. The cause
of death, apparently, was lead poisoning, the bird having in some
manner swallowed a piece of lead of considerable size. A female
llama received March 14, 1908, died of anemia, July 25, 1922, after a
life of 14 years, 4 months, and 11 days in the park. A male
barasingha deer (Cervus duvaucelii) received October 1, 1908, died
January 10, 1923, 14 years, 3 months, and 9 days after arrival. A
female rhea (Rhea americana) received October 8, 1909, died May
1, 19238, after 13 years, 6 months, and 23 days in the collection. A
female brown macaque (J/acaca speciosa) received July 30, 1910,
died May 26, 1923, of broncho-pneumonia, after a life in the park of
12 years, 9 months, and 26 days. A boatbill heron (Cochlearius
cochlearius) received September 28, 1910, died from congestion of
the lungs, 12 years, 6 months, and 18 days later, on April 15, 1923.
The mate of this bird, received with it, is still living. A female
Woodhouse’s wolf (Canis frustror), born in the park April 17, 1911,
died at an age of 11 years, 8 months, and 15 days, on August 1, 1922.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 93

Two male Madagascar weavers (Youdia madagascariensis) , received
June 28, 1912, died on September 9 and October 14, 1922, respec-
tively; a record of 10 years, 8 months, and 16 days, for one of the
birds.

One of the most serious losses of the year was that of the female
whooping crane (Grus americanus), which died of aspergillosis on
April 16, 1923. The bird had always appeared in good health up
to shortly before its death; it was still comparatively young, and
had been in the collection since April 13, 1914, a period of nine years
and three days. It is perhaps doubtful if this rare species will
ever again be on exhibition in the park. Other serious losses in-
clude a female Rocky Mountain goat, June 13, 1923, metritis;
giant anteater, October 29, 1922; red ouakari monkey (Cacajao rubi-
cundus), April 24, 1923; frogmouth, November 1, 1922, tapeworm
infestation; and the Indian jabiru, March 29, 1923, from gastro-
enteritis.

As heretofore, postmortem examinations were made in most cases
by the pathological division of the Bureau of Animal Industry.
Fifteenth examinations were made by Dr. Adolph H. Schultz, of the
Carnegie Institution, Laboratory of Embryology, and one by spe-
cialists at St. Elizabeths Hospital, Department of the Interior.
The following list shows the results of autopsies, the cases being
arranged by groups:

of special scientific value, were Fe sei death to the
United States National Museum. A number of eggs of rare birds
were also transferred to the Museum. At the request of the Car-
negie Laboratory of Embryology, Johns Hopkins Medical School,
Baltimore, 27 specimens, mostly mammals, were delivered to that

institution for anatomical purposes.

One mammal was sent to

The number of species on exhibition on June 30 is 16 more, and the
total number of animals is 87 more than in any previous year.

VISITORS

The total number of visitors to the park, for the fiscal year, as
determined by count and estimate, was 2,393,428. This is 229,174
above the official record for 1922, and makes the fourth year in suc-
cession that the attendance has exceeded 2,000,000. The greatest
attendance in any one month was 330,700 in May, 1923.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 101
IMPROVEMENTS

The complete reconstruction of the wolf and fox dens below the
sea lion pool was finished early in the year. The quarters for these
animals are now much more comfortable and sanitary than before
and immensely improved in appearance. The outdoor cages for
rhesus and other monkeys were all repaired, covered with new wire,
provided with suitable water and sewer facilities, and generally put
into first-class condition. Repairs were made to the ostrich en-
closure, safety guards of electrically welded wire were placed along
the fence bordering the walk in front of the main bear dens, and
numerous minor repairs were made to cages and enclosures. In so
far as was possible with the limited funds, necessary painting was
done.

The principal construction for the year, however, has been the
continuation of work on the recently graded area in the west-central
part of the park, between the great flight cage and the hospital
building. This work was commenced seven years ago, but was dis-
continued during the war. It is greatly to be hoped that it may be
completed during the current year. After building a new road
from the hospital to the scales, near the Rocky Mountain sheep
inclosure, over the edge of the fill previously made, the old winding
road was abandoned and there was available a large area of flat
ground suitable for paddocks. Four extra large yards were designed
along the automobile road, where species commonly kept in breed-
ing herds may be shown. One yard has been especially designed for
Rocky Mountain goats and a miniature mountain of flint bowlders
has been constructed within it. The other large yards bordering the
automobile road have been prepared for red deer, barasingha deer,
and Japanese deer. On the south side, bordering the walk passing
the great flight cage for birds, are seven paddocks with shelters,
designed especially for Indian buffaloes, tahr goats, aoudads, axis
deer, and similar species. The water-buffalo yard has been provided
with a large tank for bathing, and the tahr and aoudad yards with
large rock piles. The axis deer shelter includes a closed room of
commodious size for breeding females, as this species commonly
brings forth the young in winter, when the weather out of doors
is unfavorable for young fawns. Passing directly through the center
of this system of yards from east to west is a service road along
which all of the shelter houses have been built. This system places
the retreats for animals at the rear of each yard, away from the
public, and, after proper planting, makes the buildings compara-
tively inconspicuous. It also simplifies care and the shifting or
transfer of animals without actual capture. At the end of the
102 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

year the yards and shelters were practically completed; the principal
work remaining undone includes sidewalks, parking space, tree
boxes, guard rails, and other minor accessories.

ALTERATIONS OF BOUNDARIES

With the approval on January 23, 1923, of the second deficiency
bill, there was available $8,000 for the purchase of the strip of land
between the park and Adams Mill Road between Ontario Road and
Clydesdale Place. The completion of this purchase adds about 8,000
feet of land to the area of the park and protects the entrance at
Adams Mill Road from unsightly development on one side. A new
danger that threatens the beauty of this entrance way to the park
has, however, most unexpectedly arisen. On March 4, 1923, an act
of Congress was passed and approved dissolving the cemetery asso-
ciation controlling the burial ground bordering the Zoological Park
on the south between Adams Mill Road and Rock Creek. The
trustees named in the bill are authorized to transfer the bodies in-
terred in this old cemetery and to sell the land. The permanent
highways plan of the District of Columbia shows a proposed road
across this property from Adams Mill Road to Calvert Street Bridge.
It will be necessary in order to protect this section of the park,
especially the beautiful roadway leading down from the Adams
Mill Road entrance, to acquire that portion of the cemetery lying
between this proposed roadway and the park boundary. It has been
suggested that the permanent highways plan be modified, and that
the proposed road across the old cemetery be made from Adams Mill
Road at the corner of the Zoological Park to join Waterside Drive
at Calvert Street Bridge. This would greatly reduce the area to be
purchased for park purposes and amply protect the interests of the

public.

Restaurant.—As pointed out in recent reports, a suitable restau-
rant building remains the most urgent need of the park. The old
refreshment stand was constructed many years ago of the cheapest
materials. At the present time it is in a bad condition and is wholly
inadequate to serve the needs of the public. The refreshment booth
at Connecticut Avenue, on land recently transferred to the Govern-
ment, should also be replaced by a new and more sightly structure.
The increased income from rental of these two concessions will well
repay for the construction of buildings adequate for the service of
the constantly increasing number of visitors.

Bird house-—The valuable collection of rare and interesting birds
now the property of the Government remains poorly housed for ex-
hibition purposes. Because of the great interest taken in this divi-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 103

sion of the collection and the numbers of beautiful and curious birds
from all parts of the world that are presented to the park, the col-
lection is constantly growing. The old bird house was built as a
temporary structure many years ago and, in addition to being in a
bad condition, is entirely too small either to accommodate the crowds
of interested visitors or to show to advantage the birds. Many rare
specimens, as a matter of fact, can not regularly be placed on ex-
hibition because of lack of room. It is greatly to be hoped that a
new bird house may be provided for in the near future.

Funds for purchase of animals.—The park has never had sufficient
funds for the purchase of animals. Rare specimens are from time to

-time offered for sale that would fill distinct gaps in the collection,

but because of lack of funds for their purchase these are frequently
lost to the park. Two conspicuous forms of mammal life—the In-
dian rhinoceros and giraffe—may be mentioned as examples. Oppor-
tunities to purchase good specimens of these spectacular species do
not often come, but because of lack of money for their purchase the
park has had to decline the few offered in recent years. In order that
special opportunities may be taken advantage of promptly, there
should be available from year to year a reasonable sum for the pur-
chase and transportation of animals.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY

Str: The Astrophysical Observatory was conducted under the fol-
lowing passage of the independent offices appropriation act approved
June 12, 1922:

Astrophysical Observatory: For maintenance of the Astrophysical Observ-
atory, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including assist-
ants, purchase of necessary books and periodicals, apparatus, making necessary
observations in high altitudes, repairs and alterations of buildings, and miscel-
laneous expenses, $15,500.

The observatory occupies a number of frame structures within an
inclosure of about 16,000 square feet south of the Smithsonian ad-
ministration building at Washington, and also a cement observing
station and frame cottage for observers on a plot of 10,000 square
feet leased from the Carnegie Solar Observatory, on Mount Wilson,
Calif.

A new solar observing station on Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., was
erected in July, 1920, at the expense of funds donated for the purpose
by Mr. John A. Roebling, of Bernardsville, N. J., and this station
has been occupied as a solar radiation observing station by the Astro-
physical Observatory since October, 1920.

The present value of the buildings and equipment for the Astro-
physical Observatory, owned by the Government, is estimated at
$50,000. This estimate contemplates the cost required to replace the
outfit for the purposes of the investigation.

Work at Washington.—No observations were attempted at Wash-
ington. Mr. Fowle, Mrs. Bond, and the director, as much of his time
as possible, were engaged in computations necessary (1) to the search
for systematic errors in the work of Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., and
the application of carefully determined corrections thereto; (2) to
the publication of a comparison of two years of observations at
Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., and Mount Montezuma, Chile (see
Monthly Weather Review, February, 1923); (8) to the preparation
of a new set of curves for use from January 1, 1923, in the short
method of solar constant determination at Montezuma, Chile; (4) to
the search for systematic errors and the application of carefully de-
termined corrections to Montezuma results on the new basis; (5) to

104
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 105

the reduction of observations made at Mount Wilson in 1922 on the
form of the solar spectrum energy curve and on the spectrum energy
curves of ten of the brighter stars.

It was apparent from the comparison just referred to between
the results of the two field stations that they were in close accord on
the sun’s variation. But the Chile station was employing in its
reductions the results of work prior to 1913 on the distribution of
radiation in the solar energy spectrum; while the Arizona station
was employing results of 1920. Moreover, the pyranometer in use
in Chile was of an old type unsuitable to the work. Furthermore, the
sharpness of definition of the spectrum employed at Mount Harqua
Hala was inferior to that employed at Montezuma. It seemed prob-
able that to remedy these defects and put the two stations on equality
in all respects would lead to even closer harmony in their results,
although it meant a revision of the whole scheme of reductions at
both stations, with a redetermination of the systematic errors at each.
This is very important, for the solar variations rarely exceed 5 per
cent, and are mainly less than 2 per cent. It taxes the best observing
to reveal them. These were the circumstances which led to the large
computing program stated in the preceding paragraph. It has re-
sulted in putting the two stations on equal footing in every possible
way. They are now capable of turning out jointly the best results
on the solar variation that our experience can suggest a means to
attain.

The instrument maker, Mr. Kramer, has been on detached service
for almost the entire year, engaged in the preparation, according
to plans of the director, of two solar radiation outfits ordered,
respectively, by a committee of interested gentlemen in Australia
and by the Government of Argentina. The Australian outfit was
finished and sent forward in June, 1923. The Argentine outfit will
go forward about December, 1923.

Field work at Mount Wilson.—Messrs. Abbot and Aldrich ob-
served on Mount Wilson in the months of July, August, and the
fore part of September, 1922. They redetermined the form of the
solar spectrum energy curve. For this investigation they employed
several different prisms, including two of rock salt. Their object in
this course was to vary the procedure, as far as possible, so as to
get several independent checks on the results. Upon reduction, all
of the results of 1922 came into good accord with one another, and
confirmed the work of 1920 very satisfactorily. It now appears
that a large part of the earlier work, on which results published in
Volumes III and IV of the Annals were based, was injured in ac-
curacy by the employment of a quartz prism of inferior transparency.
If this quartz prism work is rejected, the remaining early work is
106 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

in fair accord with that of 1920 and 1922. The new results, therefore,
now are accepted, and were published immediately after their com-
pletion. (Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, Vol. 74, No. 7,
1923.)

In the course of this solar energy spectrum work, the observers
made solar energy curves with rock-salt prisms at different hours
of the day, extending as far down the spectrum as to wave-length
14 microns. As yet these observations are not reduced.

A long and difficult task was undertaken in the observation of the
prismatic energy spectra of 10 of the brighter stars in the focus of
the 100-inch reflector on Mount Wilson. After much discourage-
ment in preparation of apparatus and preliminary trials, successful
results were obtained on three nights. The apparatus included a
special bolometer and a special galvanometer. Changes of tem-
perature of about one one-hundred-millionth of a degree Centigrade
were observable, and electric currents of about 10-?* amperes were
read with the galvanometer of 10 ohms resistance. So sensitive was
the device that it was affected to an almost incredible extent by
electromagnetic induction. It even appeared that the operation of
electric power in Pasadena and Los Angeles was effective to cause
disturbance through the transmission lines up the mountain though
cut off at the power house a thousand feet away from the telescope.
Accordingly, best observations were made after 2 o’clock in the
morning. The results are given in the paper just cited.

Field work in Arizona and Chile-—The Mount Harqua Hala sta-
tion observed solar variation throughout the year under the efficient
direction of Mr. A. F. Moore, assisted until April, 1923, by Mr. F. A.
Greeley. Mr. P. E. Greeley, who had been at Montezuma, exchanged
places with his brother and reported at Harqua Hala about June
8, 1923.

Mr. L. B. Aldrich assumed the directorship at Montezuma about
December 20, 1922, succeeding Mr. L. H. Abbot. At both stations
the results of 1923 have been very numerous. They had not yet been
critically compared at the close of the period covered by this report.

RESULTS OF THE WORK ON SOLAR RADIATION

As long ago as 1903, we found in the observations then being con-
ducted in Washington some indieation of a variation of the sun’s
output of radiation. These indications were pursued for several
years at Mount Wilson and Mount Whitney, and became so strong
that, in 1911 and 1912, expeditions were maintained in Algeria,
coincident with one at Mount Wilson, to test whether the supposed
solar variations were really of local character. The results seemed
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 107

confirmatory of real solar changes. The work went on in summer
months at Mount Wilson, with gradual improvements up to 1920.

In the meantime Mr. H. H. Clayton, forecaster of the meteoro-
logical service of Argentina, had communicated evidence, at first by
letter and later in two Smithsonian publications (Effect of Short
Period Variations of Solar Radiation on the Earth’s Atmosphere,
Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, Vol. 68, No. 8, 1917; and
Variation in Solar Radiation and the Weather, Smithsonian Mis-
cellaneous Collections, Vol. 71, No. 3, 1920), showing dependence of
the weather of various parts of the world on fluctuations-of solar
radiation. These indications he has now amplified and recently
elaborately published (H. H. Clayton, “ World Weather,” Macmillan
Co., New York, 1923). But even at the beginning, to one trained
by the late Secretary S. P. Langley to hope that some time some con-
nection would appear between solar and terrestrial changes, Mr.
Clayton’s work was very interesting.

At the writer’s suggestion, Secretary Walcott approved the ex-
penditure of accrued interest from the Hodgkins Fund to undertake
all-year-round observations of solar variation in a cloudless climate.
The Great War hindered the expedition, but it went forward in 1918
to Calama, Chile, a station chosen on the advice and extensive manu-
script data furnished by Dr. Walter Knoche, formerly in charge of
the weather service of Chile.

By that time Mr. Clayton’s researches had led him to believe that
actual forecasts might advantageously be based on solar radiation
work. Accordingly, soon after the establishment of the Chile sta-
tion, arrangements were made to telegraph its results to Buenos
Aires, and a system of forecasting based thereon has actually been in
use in Argentina for several years. Some of its results are quoted in
the book of Mr. Clayton, just cited.

The work almost immediately attracted the favorable attention
of Mr. John A. Roebling. By his advice and financial assistance,
the Mount Wilson work was transferred to a more cloudless locality
for all-year-round observing at Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., and also
the Calama work was transferred to a higher station, Montezuma,
outside the dust and smoke of Calama and Chuquicamata, which
had been serious inconveniences.

During these many years we had plodded on in hope of a satis-
fying fruition of our labors. Many signs there were that the solar
radiation varies sufficiently to be of importance in terrestrial con-
cerns. But they were of the nature of incompletely verified evi-
dences of various sorts, all pointing the same way, but none in itself
conclusive. With the continuous all-year-round occupation of the
two first-rate stations, made possible by Mr. Roebling’s generosity,
108 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

the matter could be put, for the first time, to a rigorous test. And
now we have made this test. It is conclusive and proves the sub-
stantial character of solar variation. Hereafter we walk by sight
where hitherto we walked by faith.

In the publication cited (Monthly Weather Review, February,
1923) -we show that in over 100 days, when results were obtained at
both Arizona and Chile, the average deviation of one station fromm
the other is 0.68 per cent, thus indicating a probable error of one
day’s observation at one station of 0.41 per cent. The average devia-
tion for two years of monthly mean values between the two stations
is 0.38 per cent, and this small value would doubtless be considerably
smaller if the individual days of the several months had always been
coincident. Although in opposite hemispheres, where winter at one
station falls in summer at the other station, there is no evidence of
seasonal divergence between the two stations. They unite in show-
ing solar variation. Indeed the march of the monthly mean values
from November, 1921, to September, 1922, in which they agree closely,
gives the most conspicuous instance of long-continued solar change
in a given direction which we have ever noted. The reader may
compare it with the four years of monthly means curve given at the
top of the illustration.

In short, there can not be, we think, any longer a reasonable ques-
tion that the sun varies, or that our observations can reveal these
variations satisfactorily. It is now a question for meteorologists
whether these variations are of importance in weather forecasting.
As we report these satisfying conclusions, it ought to be reported at
the same time that the financial support furnished the Astrophysical
Observatory by the Government would not have sufficed to obtain
these results without the aid of the Hodgkins fund of the Smith-
sonian Institution, and the generous financial support and wise
counsel of Mr. John A. Roebling.

Although done a few days after the close of the period covered by
this report, it will be fitting in this connection to mention some pre-
liminary observations on changes of the appearance of the sun accom-
panying changes in its output of radiation. Being at Pasadena in
July, 1923, the director availed himself of permission given by
Director Adams to examine two years of record prints from direct
photographs and hydrogen (H«) spectroheliograms of the sun made
at the Mount Wilson Solar Observatory. Four general rules or
principles seemed to be well established by the comparisons made.

1. When increased sun-spot activity appears, either by new spot
groups forming on the visible solar disk, by the growth of spots
already present, or by the coming on of a new group due to the
solar rotation, then on that very day the solar constant value in-
creases. :

b]
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY . 109

2. When a sun-spot group is carried by the solar rotation across
the central diameter of the visible disk, then the solar constant
value declines, and usually has a minimum on the day following
such central transit.

3. When many spot groups, faculae, or long strings of dark
hydrogen flocculi indicate that great solar activity is prevailing, the
solar constant is high.

4, When a long quiescent period occurs in solar activity, the solar
constant values steadily decline.

These rules connecting the solar radiation with the sun’s visible
appearance seem to hold some promise of quantitative development.
Possibly there may be found some formula for computing solar
constant values by the aid of direct solar photographs and hydrogen
and calcium spectroheliograms, which may enable the solar radiation
values to be expressed with fair approximation for the past quarter
of a century. If so, it will be of great advantage.

PERSONNEL

In addition to the changes of personnel above mentioned, Mr.
William H. Hoover was temporarily engaged as assistant beginning
March 12, 1923. He is in training to be director of the proposed
solar radiation observatory of the Argentine Government at La
Quiaca, Argentina. Mr. Hoover spent some time in Washington
and some upon Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz. Mrs. Arline Leary
served as temporary computer, beginning April 16, 1923. Both of
these assistants were paid from funds given for the purpose by
Mr. John A. Roebling.

SUMMARY

A comparison of two years of results on the variation of solar
radiation observed at Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., and Montezuma,
Chile, shows close accord between the stations and agreement be-
tween them in showing forth solar changes of both long and short
interval types. -Monthly mean values of both stations indicate a
long continued decline of the output of solar radiation beginning in
November, 1921, and continuing at least until September, 1922.
This is in some respects the most remarkable solar change on record.
Great improvements have been made at both stations, and their ob-
servations have been put as far as possible on exactly equal footing.
It is believed that beginning January 1, 1924, there will be still
closer accord in their reuslts. Definite correspondences have been
observed between the variation of the sun’s radiation and the varia-
tion of the most marked of its visible features. Several new deter-
minations of the form of the sun’s energy spectrum distribution
110 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

curve confirm the similar work of 1920, and lead to a revision of the
results of earlier work published in Volumes III and IV of the
Observatory Annals. Energy spectra of 10 of the brighter stars
were observed at the focus of the 100-inch telescope on Mount Wil-
son by means of a special spectrobolometric apparatus. Tempera-
ture differences of approximately one one-hundred-millionth of a
degree centigrade were measured in this investigation. Solar radia-
tion outfits have been prepared for Australia and Argentina, to be
installed in the year 1923.

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the United States Regional Bureau of the International
Catalogue of Scientific Literature for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1923.

As the success of this international enterprise, in common with all
undertakings dependent on international cooperation, is necessarily
controlled by world politics, it has been the hope of all interested in
the International Catalogue that each year conditions would develop
which would make reorganization possible and justify resumption of
publication. As international affairs, both political and financial,
are apparently still far removed from normalcy, the affairs of the
catalogue are practically in the same condition as they were in 1922.
As was noted in the last annual report, the Smithsonian Institution
submitted a statement of its position to an international convention
held in Brussels in July, 1922, to consider the affairs of the catalogue.
This statement carried with it a suggestion whose object was to keep
the international organization in existence, it being generally con-
ceded that should the countries who are now and have been for the
past 22 years officially cooperating in the support of the enterprise
be for any reason disunited it would be practically impossible to
ever regain their interest and support. Though these suggestions
were printed in the last report of this bureau, they are in part
reprinted here, as on them were based the resolutions to continue the
regional bureaus until reorganization could be accomplished:

It is the belief of the Smithsonian Institution

1. That a classified subject and author index to the literature of science is
needed.

2. That no better means exists of attaining the end sought than by carrying
out the original plan of the International Catalogue based on international
cooperation, guided by uniform rules and schedules modified to meet changes
in the several sciences, and, when possible, broadened in scope to include the
allied technical branches of these sciences.

8. That every effort should be made to cooperate with all similar enterprises.
including abstracting agencies, existing or projected, not only to prevent dupli-
cation of labor, but also to better serve the demands of those in need of
bibliographic aid.

111
112 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

4, That on account of abnormal conditions still controlling publishing costs
and monetary exchange, it is probable that actual publication can not be at
present resumed unless financial aid is had from some source outside the pres-
ent organization ; however, it is believed,

5. That the international organization should be kept in being through mu-
tual agreement to continue the work of the regional bureaus until such time
as it may be economically possible to resume publication. When that time ar-
rives the stock of complete sets already published should be advertised for sale
at a price within the reach of the smaller libraries and institutions, many of
whom, although desiring this unique reference work, were prevented from
subscribing on account of the high original cost.

Were the price reduced even to one-fourth of the original, stock in hand at
that figure represents a sufficient sum to meet all outstanding obligations and
leave a surplus for working capital.

This statement was read at the opening meeting of the conven-

tion and after a short discussion the following resolutions were
adopted :

That the convention is of opinion that the international organization should
be kept in being through mutual agreement to continue as far as possible the
work of the regional bureaus until such time as it may be economically possible
to resume publication.

That it be referred to the executive committee to consider and after full con-
sultation with interested bodies to make proposals as to the form of future
publication and to report with Some definite scheme to a meeting of the inter-
national council to be summoned as soon as it appears possible that the publi-
cation can be resumed.

The executive committee referred to consists of one representative
from each of the following-named countries; England, France,
Italy, Japan, Holland, Denmark, and the United States.

At this convention Prof. Henry E. Armstrong, chairman of the
executive committee, who is the only one of the founders of the cata-
logue remaining in the organization, submitted a report from which
the following items have been copied:

At the outset there was great enthusiasm for the work among those who
were its promoters in the different countries and great care was taken in the
preparation of the scheme; the organization that has been developed, in con-
sequence, has worked with remarkable smoothness. Bureaus have been estab-
lished in 32 countries, and the relations between these and the central office in
London have always been of the most harmonious character possible.

Most convincing proof has been obtained that international cooperation to
such an end is not merely possible but may be made most effective. That all
that was aimed at has been accomplished need not be contended; but the
obvious shortcomings of the catalogue have been almost entirely due to lack
of funds. To have established a system so widespread in its operations is no
small achievement in itself.

I am profoundly convinced that the principles underlying the preparation of
the catalogue are sound and that an international system of cataloguing
scientific literature is proved to be feasible and that its advantages are in-
contestable. -
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 113

-

It is the first work of the kind to be carried out in such detail and over
so long a period—more than 20 years. To abandon the enterprise after so
satisfactory a foundation has been laid would be to sacrifice an unique ex-
perience gained at the expense of great labor.

From the foregoing facts and opinions and from the experience
of all who have occasion to use bibliographical aids, in matters
relating to science and all its branches, it is apparent—

1. That there is a need for recording for the purpose of present and future
reference the published results of scientific achievements.

2. That such a record to be comprehensive and complete must be interna-
tional in its scope and therefore must necessarily be prepared through inter-
national cooperation.

3. That excepting for the organization known as the International Catalogue
of Scientific Literature, no such agency exists.

4. That, though not claiming perfection, the International Catalogue up to
the beginning of the late war was and had been for some 14 years answering
the demands and requirements of an international authors’ list and classified
subject index to the world’s literature of science.

5. That the principal defects of the International Catalogue were lack of
capital; lack of complete cooperation with enterprises similar in nature though
more limited in scope.

All of these defects had been recognized and their correction pro-
vided for by authority vested in the executive committee, whose plans
were frustrated by the beginning of war and consequent financial
collapse. It is believed and maintained by the advocates of the
International Catalogue that the foundation as it at present exists,
in spite of its financial difficulties, is the best and only one in existence
on which to build a new and more far-reaching organization, tres-
passing on no occupied fields, though cooperating for the common
good with all enterprises having the same or similar objects in view.

While many projects have been proposed and are now being advo-
cated, none either in plan or scope compare with the International
Catalogue and none have the international recognition and official
support necessary for success. The capital needed to refinance the
enterprise is so small in comparison with the results to be attained
that it would be strange indeed if in this day of large ideas and large
financial outlays this most promising bond between and aid for the
thinkers and workers of all nations should be allowed to remain so
crippled that its wealth of information must continue to be inacces-
sible because unpublished.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE LIBRARY

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the
activities of the library of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1923.

Much has been accomplished, it is felt, toward better library serv-
ice. Principal original articles, appearing in scientific and technical
periodicals received for the Smithsonian deposit, have been brought
to the attention of members of the staff, through the continued
preparation of a daily list, circulated among heads of scientific bu-
reaus under the Smithsonian Institution. Books in the employees’
library have been rendered more accessible by their transfer to the
present quarters. Better protection has been provided for the older
accession books and other records by their removal to darker and less
frequented quarters, and congestion has thus been relieved in the
receiving room and in the filing cases. The number of publications
loaned during the year reached a total of 12,076, and fully as many
were consulted without being taken out.

Many rare volumes that otherwise would have required purchase
at great expense have been received in exchange or by gift. Back
numbers of publications required to complete sets have been re-
quested in exchange from societies and organizations abroad, and
many have generously responded during the year by presenting
valuable material, hitherto not available in American libraries. Spe-
cial attention has been given to the transmittal of Smithsonian pub-
lications in exchange.

FOREIGN PERIODICALS

A classified list has been prepared during the year of foreign
periodicals, exclusive of annuals and irregular serials, and the fol-
lowing table of subjects and languages is submitted:

BIBLIOGRAPHIC RESEARCHES

The third volume of the “ Bibliography of Aeronautics,” covering
the years 1917 to 1919, inclusive, compiled by the assistant librarian
of the Smithsonian Institution, Paul Brockett, was issued during
the year by the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. The
first volume of this bibliography was issued in 1910 as volume 55
of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.

Efforts have been made for a number of years to compile a cata-
logue of the Watts de Peyster collection, Napoleon Bonaparte, and
a bibliography of scientific and technical periodicals, but up to the
past few years it has not been possible to devote much time to
these projects. During the past year, however, Mr. Condit has been _
able to bring together a catalogue of the rarer historical works in
the Watts de Peyster collection, and to prepare a classified list of
current foreign periodicals received for the library. The latter work
should not be confused with the larger plan, under way for many
years, for the compilation of a list of publications of learned societies
of the world in libraries throughout the United States. The com-
pletion of this project does not seem possible without the expen-
diture of a large sum of money, which is not at present available.
116 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

In the following reports of libraries administered under the
Smithsonian Institution, a decrease will be noted in accessions, the
natural consequence of the decline in publication abroad and the fact
that war accumulations were taken care of last year.

SMITHSONIAN MAIN LIBRARY

The additions to the main library, numbering 5,719, have been
transmitted to the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Congress,
where they are made available to the public. Documents of for-
eign Governments, received in exchange for Smithsonian publica-
tions, have been transmitted in accordance with the established
practice, without stamping or recording. The number of publica-
tions accessioned has now reached 893,307.

Theses were received from universities and institutes of technology
abroad located at the following places: Amsterdam, Basel, Berlin,
Bern, Bonn, Breslau, Clermont, Copenhagen, Delft, Dresden, Frei-
burg, Ghent, Giessen, Halle, Helsingfors, Karlsruhe, Kiel, Konigs-
berg, Leipzig, Lund, Rostock, Tokyo, Tiibingen, Utrecht, Ziirich.

A number of universities have temporarily discontinued the prac-
tice of sending the complete thesis, owing to the increased cost of
printing, and are now submitting them in abstract only.

Missing parts of incomplete sets were requested in exchange, as
in previous years, with an increased percentage secured, although
there was a decline both in wants requested and in wants secured.
Of 2,174 publications requested, 921 were secured, a percentage of
43.2 as against 39.1 for last year.

SMITHSONIAN OFFICE LIBRARY

The number of publications loaned from the office library was
2,756. The accessions numbered 378, of which 347 were volumes and
the remainder parts and pamphlets. Attention should be called to
the fact that no binding has been done for the office library during
the last six years, owing to lack of funds.

The progress of the cataloguing in the general library catalogue
of the Smithsonian Institution, kept in the office library, is shown

by the following statistics:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 117

Mention should also be made of the collection deposited by Mrs.
Charles D. Walcott, who has kindly extended the period of deposit.
It is frequently consulted by employees of the Smithsonian In-
stitution.

UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM

The widespread interest of members of the staff and friends
of the museum is shown by the material donated during the year.
Among the donors are Messrs. H. E. Boving, A..H. Clark, F. W.
Clarke, W. H. Dall, Whitman Cross, C. G. Gilbert, O. P. Hay,
A. D. Hopkins, Ale’ Hrdli¢ka, Emmanuel de Margerie, W. R.
Maxon, W. de C. Ravenel, C. W. Richmond, 8. A. Rohwer, W.
Schaus, and Charles D. Walcott. The gifts of Doctor Dall to the
sectional library of mollusks numbered 168 titles.

Valuable material has continued to come in exchange from mu-
seums, research organizations, and scientific societies at home and
abroad.

The receipts of the year numbered 1,489 volumes and 2,796 pam-
phlets, bringing the total of books and other material in the library
up to 160,560. Of these there are 62,170 accessioned volumes. New
entry cards were made for 239 periodicals, and 138,314 parts were
entered.

Much of the library’s reference service is rendered through the
sectional libraries, under the immediate custody of members of the
scientific and administrative staff, located as follows:

NATURAL HISTORY BUILDING

American archeology. Mollusks.

Anthropology. Old World archeology.
Birds. Paleobotany.

Fishes, Physical anthropology.

118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

It will be seen that the use of the library can not be estimated upon
the basis of its loans alone. Many volumes are consulted in the
general library, the technological library, and the various sectional
libraries without being taken out. References are frequently re-
quested over the telephone by members of the staff of the Museum
and other Government bureaus, and every effort is made to comply
with these requests. Of the 9,220 loans made during the year, 5,191
were to the sectional libraries and 1,929 were borrowed from other
libraries.

The subject catalogue of the library has been increased by 4,400
cards. The arrangement of accumulated cards from the Concilium
Bibliographicum, received since the close of the war, has been
progressing and is well under way.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY LIBRARY

The requirements of the staff of the Astrophysical Observatory,
both in Washington and at the various stations, in the way of ref-
erence service, are met through the Astrophysical Observatory
Library. Loans are made through the Smithsonian Office Library.
There were added during the year 113 volumes, 27 parts of volumes,
and 54 pamphlets.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY LIBRARY

The activities of the Bureau of American Ethnology Library are
covered in the report of the chief of that bureau. The library is
administered under his immediate direction.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK LIBRARY

The library of the National Zoological Park, located three miles
distant from the Smithsonian building, contains supplemental ma-
terial of importance in the fields of zoology and park administration.
The increase for the year, as shown by accessions, was six volumes
and four parts.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

The National Gallery of Art Library is rapidly growing. Since
the gallery has begun the issuance of a separate series of publications
there has been a noteworthy increase in the material that has been
received in exchange. There were accessioned 128 volumes and 213
periodicals. Periodical parts numbered 740. The gift of the year
most worthy of mention is the large, handsomely illustrated volume
of paintings in the Bachstitz Gallery at The Hague.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY 119
FREER GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY

In connection with the art collections in the Freer building, a
large library was brought together by Mr. Freer. A catalogue of the
works contained in it has not been incorporated in the general library
of the Institution. There have been, however, 187 accessions in the
library, and 10 of these were added during the year. Many other
volumes belonging to the Smithsonian Institution have been depos-
ited in that building, to be retained indefinitely, most of these being
reference works and volumes relating to Oriental art.

SUMMARY OF RECEIPTS AND ACCESSIONS

The number of pieces of mail received during the year was 25,553,
of which 6,272 publications were Government documents, and were
sent to the Library of Congress, in accordance with the established
practice. Additions to the library, as shown by the accession records,
‘are given below.

128 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

A piece of improved real estate, at 140 East Capitol Street, Wash-
ington, D. C., forming a part of the original bequest of the late
Robert Stanton Avery, has been sold. Payment in part was made in
cash and the balance by note. ;

The total amount of dividends and interest received by the Insti-
tution from the Freer estate during the year for all purposes was
$304,436.26. The increase in revenue was partly due to the settle-
ment of the estate by the administrators and also to the fact that
Parke, Davis & Co. declared a 100 per cent stock dividend to holders
of record December 18, 1922.

The itemized report of the auditor is filed in the office of the

secretary.

All payments are made by check, signed by the Secretary of the
Institution, on the Treasurer of the United States, and all revenues
are deposited to the credit of the same account, except in some
instances small deposits are placed in bank for convenience of col-
lection and later are withdrawn in round amounts and deposited in
the Treasury.

The practice of investing temporarily idle funds in time deposits
has proven satisfactory. During the year the interest derived from
this source, together with other similar items, has resulted in a
total of $1,732.50.

of the House of Representatives, and a regent of the Institution since January
9, 1920: Therefore be it

Resolved, That the board desire here to record their sorrow at the loss of a
colleague whose untimely death terminated a career filled with promise, and
whose interest in the affairs of the Institution made him a valued member of
the board.

The secretary also announced the death of the Hon. Lemuel P.
Padgett, who had been reappointed a regent by the Speaker of the
House of Representatives on January 4, 1922.

On motion of Mr. Greene, the following resolution was adopted:

Whereas the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution having learned
of the death, on August 2, 1922, of the Honorable Lemuel P. Padgett, a Mem-
ber of the House of Representatives, and a regent of the Institution since
December 15, 1917: Therefore be it

Resolved, That the board here place on record their deep sense of loss at
the passing away of their associate, whose career as citizen and statesman
was distinguished by lofty purpose and fulfillment, and whose wise counsel in
the deliberations of the board will be greatly missed.

DEATH OF FORMER REGENT

The secretary stated that Dr. A. Graham Bell attended the last
annual meeting of the board, although not in robust health; that
his fourth term as a regent expired on February 20, 1922, thus
completing 24 years of service; and that he had decided not to

133
134 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

accept another term. Doctor Bell’s illness terminated fatally on
August 2 at his home in Baddeck, Nova Scotia.

In view of Doctor Bell’s long service as a regent, it was suggested
that there be included in the records of the board a suitable brief
memorial of his life and work.

The Chief Justice then presented the following resolution, which
was adopted:

Resolved, That the executive committee be requested to prepare a memorial
commemorative of the life and work of Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, regent

of the Smithsonian Institution from 1898 to 1922, said memorial to be pre-
sented at the next annual meeting of the board.

A joint resolution providing for the appointment of Mr. John A.
Roebling, of New Jersey, to fill the vacancy created by the expira-
tion of Doctor Bell’s term, had been passed by the Senate and re-
ferred to the House of Representatives, but Mr. Roebling declined
the appointment on account of poor health.

VACANCY IN THE MEMBERSHIP OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

The secretary stated that the expiration of Doctor Bell’s term as a
regent had caused a vacancy in the membership of the executive
committee, and that, under a resolution of the board of regents,
adopted December 10, 1914, the chancellor had appointed Mr. John
B. Henderson to fill the vacancy “until the next regular meeting
of the board.”

On motion of Mr. White, the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the temporary appointment of Mr. John B. Henderson as a
member of the executive committee be approved and continued until the expira-
tion of his term as regent.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

=
The annual report of the executive committee for the fiscal year
-ending June 80, 1922, in printed form, was submitted by the secre-

tary.
On motion, the report was accepted.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTER

This report was read by the secretary, as follows:

Hodgkins fund.—As stated in previous reports, $5,000 is allotted annually
from the Hodgkins specific fund for the maintenance of an astrophysical station
on the Montezuma Mountain, in Chile, where studies in solar radiation are
being carried on continuously. The work is under the direction of Dr. Charles
G. Abbot, Assistant Secretary of the Institution and Director of the Astrophysi-
cal Observatory.

Roebling contribution.—Mr. John A. Roebling, of New Jersey, has contributed
further funds to advance the work of solar research stations in Chile and
Arizona and the publication of results there attained. The contributions of
Mr. Roebling to date for this work aggregate more than $40,000.

Avery bequest.—All the real estate covered by this bequest has been sold.
The Avery fund now amounts to $41,283.

Poore bequest.—This bequest has reached the sum of $36,025. Under the
testator’s will, the fund must total $250,000 before its income shall be available.
Several lots of land in the city of Lowell remain undisposed of, but will be sold
as opportunity offers. A request has been made that the taxes on this property
be abated, but it has not yet been acted upon.

Freer bequest.—A note for $200,000 given for the purpose of liquidating
Federal and inheritance taxes against the estate has been reduced to $79,250.
A balance of $28,051.05 remains under the building fund and there are several
specific accounts with balances sufficient to meet current requirements.

Virginia Purdy Bacon bequest.—This bequest was given to establish the
Walter Rathbone Bacon (traveling) scholarship for the study of the fauna of
“countries other than the United States.” The invested fund now amounts to
$48,300.

Bruce Hughes bequest.—This bequest, which was given to establish the
Hughes alcove, has been settled and amounts to $11,604.53.

Frances Lea Chamberlain fund.—Founded by Dr. Leander T. Chamberlain
as a memorial to his wife, Frances Lea. It amounts to $35,000, and the in-
come is expended in the improvement and increase of the Isaac Lea collections
of ‘“ Mollusks ” and of ‘‘ Gems and gem material,” both in the National Museum.

Walcott fund.—The income of this fund, established by Charles D. and Mary
Vaux Walcott, is to be used for research and publication, and as time goes
on for such purposes aS may be designated by the Board of Regents. The
present market value of the securities deposited amounts to $10,460.

Addison T. Reid bequest.—This bequest, which is to found a chair in
biology aS a memorial to the testator’s grandfather, Asher Tunis, now amounts
to $15,079. The bequest was subject to the condition that the income was to
be paid in three shares to certain named beneficiaries until their death. Two
of these shares have been received and the remaining share will represent
approximately $5,000.
136 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Residual bequests—No change has occurred in the status of the following
estates, of which the Institution will become the residuary legatee, subject
to the death of certain specified beneficiaries:

The Joseph White Sprague bequest.
The Lucy Hunter Baird bequest.
The Riter Fitzgerald bequest.

The Caroline Henry bequest.

Consolidated fund.—This fund is composed of miscellaneous bequests and
moneys received in excess of $1,000,000, deposited in the United States Treasury
under the authority of the organic act. During the year several small bequests
have been added to the consolidated fund, which now aggregates $179,390.28.

On motion of Mr. Johnson, the following resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution accepts
the annual report of the permanent committee just read and approves and
ratifies the actions taken by the committee since the last annual meeting.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY

In submitting his annual report for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1922, the secretary stated that since the last annual meeting of the
Regents 131 publications, comprising 7,785 pages, have been issued
by the Institution and its branches. The general appendix to the
annual report of the board to Congress contains a selection of pop-
ular illustrated articles describing recent advances in nearly every
branch of science, and the demand for the report soon exhausts the
edition of 10,000 copies.

On motion, the secretary’s report was accepted.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART COMMISSION

The annual meeting of the commission was held December 12,
1922, at which it was voted to recommend to the Board of Regents
the appointment for a full term of four years of Messrs. Herbert
Adams, Gari Melchers, and Charles Moore, their one-year terms hav-
ing expired. Messrs. Moore, Adams, and Parmelee were elected by
the commission to succeed themselves as members of the executive
committee.

The report of the National Gallery of Art for the year was sub-
mitted, as were also reports of the standing, special, and subcom-
mittees.

Messrs. E. W. Redfield, W. H. Holmes, and Gari Melchers were
appointed a committee to look after the interests of the National
Gallery in connection with the final disposition of purchases by the
National Academy of Design to be made under the Ranger bequest
fund.

The urgent need of a National Gallery building was emphasized
and discussion took place as to the advisability of applying to Con-
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS 187

gress for legislation to have the building project included in the
program now being formulated for prospective buildings.

On motion the report was accepted.

Senator Lodge offered the following resolution, which was
adopted :

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution hereby
elects Messrs. Herbert Adams, Gari Melchers, and Charles Moore as members

of the National Gallery of Art Commission for the full term of four years,
their present one-year terms having expired December 14, 1922.

NEW BUILDING

The secretary spoke of the need of-space for the proper installa-
tion and exhibit of the Institution’s art and history collections,
and expressed the hope that a new building would be provided to
meet this need. No formal action was asked.

FREER GALLERY OF ART

ad
Work is being pushed as rapidly as possible in preparing the
collections, which it is hoped will be opened to the public in the
coming spring.
EXPEDITIONS

Through the generosity of Dr. W. L. Abbott, of Philadelphia,
Pa., Mr. Charles M. Hoy continued his work of collecting for the
Museum specimens of the very interesting fauna of Australia. The
work was terminated during the winter and Mr. Hoy returned to
the United States in May, 1922. The specimens received during the
year bring the total up to 1,179 mammals, including series of
skeletal and embryological material; 928 birds with 41 additional
examples in alcohol, and smaller collections of reptiles, amphibians.
insects, marine specimens, etc.

Dr. Abbott’s unfailing interest in the national collections is shown
by the fact that he has now arranged to send Mr. Hoy to China for
the purpose of obtaining vertebrates from certain especially im-
portant localities in the Yangtze Valley, a region with which Mr.
Hoy has been familiar for many yéars.

Acknowledgment is made of Doctor Abbott’s generosity in financ-
ing previous explorations, and it is thought proper to state that up
to date he has contributed $31,500 for the expenditions to Borneo,
Celibes, Australia, and China, in addition to which he has con-
tributed largely from the results of his personal efforts in Haiti and
elsewhere.

In the summer of 1921 Mr. A. de C. Sowerby returned to China
to continue the work of exploration interrupted by the war. This
138 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

work, which is made possible by the generosity of Mr. Robert S.
Clark, of New York, will now be carried on in the region south of
the Yangtze, and the zoological results will come to the National
Museum.

Secretary Walcott, accompanied by Mrs. Walcott, continued his
geological work in the Canadian Rockies. Notwithstanding bad
weather and forest fires, the season was very successful.

THE SECRETARY’S SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT

The secretary presented a supplemental statement covering the
activities of the various branches of the Institution since the print-
ing of the annual report of June 30, 1922. These will be described
in detail in the annual report for 1923.

REGULAR MEETIN G, FEBRUARY 8, 1923

Present: The Hon. Calvin Coolidge, Vice President of the United
States, chancellor, in the chair; the Hon. William H. Taft, Chief

Frank L. Greene; Representative Albert Johnson; Representative
R. Walton Moore; Mr. Irwin B. Laughlin; and the secretary, Dr.
Charles D. Walcott.

DEATH OF REGENT

The secretary announced the sudden death of Mr. John B. Hender-
son, who had attended the last meeting of the board.

Senator Lodge offered the following resolutions, which were
adopted :

Whereas the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution having learned
of the death, on January 4, 1923, of John Brooks Henderson, a regent since
March 1, 1911, and since May last a member of the executive committee:

Resolved, That the board desire here to record that in the passing away of
their colleague biological science has lost an earnest worker, the Institution
a generous donor and ardent well-wisher, and the members of this board a
valued adviser and lovable friend.

Resolved, That these resolutions be made a part of the records of the board,
and that a copy thereof be transmitted to the family of Mr. Henderson as an
expression of the profound sorrow felt at his untimely death.

APPOINTMENT OF REGENTS

The secretary stated that the President, on January 22, 1923, had
approved a joint resolution reappointing Mr. Henry White; and
another appointing Mr. Irwin B. Laughlin, of Pennsylvania, in
place of Dr. A. Graham Bell, and Mr Frederic A. Delano, of the
District. of Columbia, to succeed Mr. John B. Henderson, deceased.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS 1389

VACANCIES ON THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE

The secretary stated that the expiration of Mr. White’s term as
a Regent and the death of Mr. Henderson had caused two vacancies
in the executive committee, and that under a resolution adopted De-
cember 10, 1914, the chancellor had appointed Mr. White and Mr.
Delano to serve “ until the next regular meeting of the board.” These
temporary appointments terminated with this meeting, and it was
necessary that the board take action to fill the vacancies permanently.

Mr. Greene then’ offered the following resolution, which was
adopted:

Resolved, That the temporary appointments by the chancellor of Mr. White
and Mr. Delano as members of the executive committee be approved, and that

their membership on said committee be continued until the expiration of their
terms as Regents.

FINANCES OF THE INSTITUTION

The secretary placed before the board a number of financial tables
showing the resources of the Institution and the allotments for
carrying on its work; and urged the necessity for an increase of the
appropriations and of the Parent fund in order to provide for the
necessary extension of the Institution’s activities.

REPORT OF SPECIAL COMMITTEE

Senator Lodge, chairman, presented the report of a special com-
mittee approving drafts of a folder and a pamphlet intended for
wide distribution outlining the origin and purposes of the Institu-
tion, its various activities and resources, and its needs for the exten-
sion of its work. The report also contained a recommendation on
the question of the proposed recognition of the Institution’s bene-
factors and patrons.

The report was adopted.

NEW BUILDING FOR ART AND HISTORY COLLECTIONS

The secretary reminded the board that at the December meeting
he had called attention to the need for another museum building for
the exhibition of the Institution’s art and history collections. He
stated that he had taken this matter up with the congressional mem-
bers of the board, and that through their efforts an amendment had
been attached to the appropriations for the bureaus under the Insti-
tution, setting aside a site in the northeast corner of the Smithsonian
grounds. The act as passed by the House and Senate is as follows:

The Regents of the Smithsonian Institution are authorized to prepare pre-
- liminary plans for a suitable fireproof building with granite fronts for the

National Gallery of Art, including the National Portrait Gallery and the his-
tory collections of the United States National Museum, said building to be
140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

erected when funds from gifts or bequests are in the possession of the said
Regents, in sections or completely, on the north side of the Mall between the
Natural History Building, United States National Museum, and Seventh Street,
leaving a space between it and the latter of not less than one hundred feet
and a space of not less than one hundred feet between it and Seventh Street,
with its south front on a line with the south front of the said Natural History
Building.

The secretary added that it was his hope that the more progressive
American people would become interested in the development of the
National Gallery of Art and the history collections and in the pro-
vision of a suitable building to be erected on the site granted by
Congress.

HAMILTON FUND

The secretary stated that on January 23, 1895, the Board of
Regents adopted a resolution increasing the Hamilton fund from
$1,000 to $2,000 by the addition of accrued interest. He explained
that the increased fund yielded only a small income, and that it was
difficult to secure the services of suitable persons to give lectures
worth publishing, and also that there was another $1,000 in accrued
interest, and he recommended that the fund be increased from $2,000
to $3,000 by the addition of this sum.

Senator Lodge offered the following resolution, which was
adopted :

Resolved, That the secretary be authorized to increase the Hamilton fund
from two thousand to three thousand dollars by the addition of accrued
interest.

Other matters of interest and importance to the Institution were
considered and acted upon.

PROPOSED MUSEUM OF ARCHITECTURE

Senator Lodge brought before the board a letter from Mr. Horace
W. Peaslee, chairman of the Architects’ Advisory Council, on the
subject of a proposed museum where examples of the best archi-
tectural work of past generations could be preserved and urging that
the Smithsonian Institution should provide for such exhibits.

The secretary said that the matter had already been brought to
his attention but that the lack of funds would preclude any extended
arrangement at present.

After some discussion, Senator Lodge offered the following resolu-
tion, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the matter of the proposed museum of architecture be re-
ferred to the National Gallery of Art Commission for consideration and recom-

mendation at the annual meeting of the Board of Regents to be held December
13, 19238.

ADVERTISEMENT

The object of the Gmnrrat Appenprx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such
papers as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific
progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previous had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geol-
ogy, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology,
and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not alto-
gether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1923.

THE CONSTITUTION AND EVOLUTION OF THE STARS?

By Henry Norris RUSSELL

The preceding lectures have, I hope, presented to you a picture—
drawn rather in outline, owing to the limitations of time—of the
stars as they are known at present, their dimensions, masses, densi-
ties, surface brightness, and the like. It remains to speak of what
has been done to correlate these facts into a theory of the constitution
of the stars, and their probable evolution and age.

What makes this problem tractable, in spite of the limitations im-
posed by the remoteness of the stars in space, and our ephemeral du-
ration in time, is that we have to deal only with the simpler and
more general properties of matter. The vast variety of the forms of
rock and mountain depends upon the solidity of their materials; the
still greater diversity of the forms of organic life is based on the
presence of chemical compounds of great complexity—and neither
of these conditions can exist at all in bodies as hot as even the
coolest stars. In the stars all matter must be gaseous, and the laws
of gases are among the simplest known to physics. Add to them the
still more general laws that govern gravitation, radiation, and the
structure of atoms, and we have the controlling factors in the evo-
lution of the stars.

Considering a star, then, as a mass of gas, isolated in space, we
notice first that it must be in internal equilibrium under its own
gravitation. The weight of the overlying layers produces a pres-
sure, increasing steadily from the surface to the center, which must
at any point be balanced by the expansive tendency of the gas, arising
from its high temperature. The temperature, too, is greatest at
the center, and decreases toward the surface. Hence, heat must flow
continually through the star’s substance, down the temperature
gradient, till it escapes by radiation at the surface. The supply of
heat must be kept up in some way; and one obvious process, as
Helmholtz suggested long ago, is the slow contraction of the star.
The work done by the gravitational forces in pulling the outer parts
of the star toward the center reappears as heat produced by the
compression, and maintains the star as a going concern. As the

star contracts, its density must increase; and the pressure will in-
crease too, for the various parts of the mass are nearer one an-
other, and attract one another more strongly. When the star has
shrunk to half its original diameter, the mean density will be eight
times as great.

If the star, after contraction, continues to be “ built on the same
model,” so to speak—that is, if the law according to which the
density increases proportionally toward the center remains the same,
except for the altered scale of miles provided by the shortened
radius, the density at any point, after contraction, will also be eight
times the original density at the corresponding point (distant fro
the center by the same fraction of the radius). :

How will the pressures at the two points compare? The portion
of the star nearer the center than the point under consideration is
compressed by the weight of the overlying portions. After the
contraction, every part of these is twice as near the center as be-
fore, and will, therefore, be attracted four times more strongly.
The whole compressive force will, therefore, be four times as great
as at first; but the area over which this force is distributed will
have shrunk to one-fourth of its former amount. Hence the pres-
sure per unit of area will increase sixteenfold, as against an eight-
fold increase of density. Applying the familiar laws of gases, we
find that the temperature of the gas, after contraction, must be
twice its original value in order that equilibrium shall still exist
when the star has shrunk to half its former size. More generally,
during the whole process of contraction, the temperatures at cor-
responding points will be inversely proportional to the star’s
radius—so long, indeed, as the star continues to be built on the same
model, and the simple gas laws hold good. This proportion was
first proved by Lane of Washington, in 1870, and is known as
Lane’s law.

It appears at first sight paradoxical that a star may grow hotter
by losing heat; but the difficulty disappears when it is realized that
the heat produced by the contraction exceeds the amount which is
required to raise the temperature of the mass to the extent de-
manded by Lane’s law. The remainder is available for radiation.
and it is only as it is gradually lost into space that the process of
contraction can take place. The manner in which the surface tem-
perature of a star, which determines its color and spectral type,
will vary as it contracts is somewhat different. As has already been
shown, the light from the far interior of a star stands no chance
of getting out to the surface, but practically all of it will be scattered
away by the gases through which it passes, and remain inside the
star. Light can only reach us directly from a relatively shallow
layer close to the surface, and it is a certain sort of average of the
CONSTITUTION OF THE STARS—RUSSELL 147
~

temperatures throughout this layer that gives the effective surface
temperature. As the density of the star varies, the depth of this
layer will alter, and in such a way that it always contains the same
number of tons of material per square foot, since it is upon this
quantity that the amount of scattering of light passing through the
layer depends. As the star contracts, the total quantity of matter
in this superficial radiating layer will therefore diminish propor-
tionally to the surface area; that is, the radiating layer will form
an ever decreasing part of the whole mass of the star, and its depth
will be a smaller fraction of the star’s radius. If the depth were a
fixed fraction of the radius, we could apply the law of correspond-
ing points and say that the temperature would vary inversely as
the radius; but, in fact, after contraction the new radiating layer
will form only the upper portion of the layer which “ corresponds ”
to the old radiating layer, and its average temperature will be lower
than that of the “ corresponding ” layer. On any reasonable assump-
tions regarding the way in which the temperature varies in the
outer part of the star, it is found that the effective temperature of
the surface will increase as it contracts, but much more slowly than
the central temperature.

All these conclusions are based upon the fundamental assumption
that the simple gas laws hold good throughout the star. This may
safely be assumed if the density is low—say, not more than 20 times
that of air—but when the density begins to approach that of water,
it will certainly be very far from the truth. As the density in-
creases, the compressibility diminishes, so that, at the same tem-
perature, it takes a greater increase of pressure to produce a further
increase of density than would be necessary in a perfect gas. In
other words, the material is better able than a perfect gas to stand
up under pressure. Hence, referring to the argument by which
Lane’s law was proved, we see that a smaller increase of temperature
than is demanded by this law will enable it to meet the changing
conditions resulting from contraction. Indeed, a point will in time
be reached when no further rise of temperature at all is needed, the
decreased compressibility of the dense gas taking the whole load.
Beyond this the increased pressure due to contraction acting alone
will be insufficient to produce the necessary increase in density, and a
fall in temperature must complete the adjustment.

We see, therefore, that a sphere of real gas, contracting under
its own gravitation, will follow Lane’s law only while its density
is small. As it contracts further its temperature will rise more
slowly than this law indicates, reach a maximum, and then gradu-
ally diminish. During this long process, the model upon which
the mass is built will itself gradually change—the increase of density
toward the center diminishing—but this will not alter the general
148 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

character of the phenomena. We may at least say with confidence
that the surface temperature, as well as that in the interior, will
reach a maximum and then diminish, until at last the mass will
shrink nearly to the greatest density which it can possibly attain,
and end by cooling off almost like a solid body. During the early
stages, while the temperature is rising, the body will be of large
diameter. As it contracts its surface will diminish, but its surface
brightness will increase, so that the amount of light which it gives
out will not change much. It will, however, grow whiter as it
gets hotter, until it reaches its maximum attainable temperature.
By this time it will be much smaller in diameter than at the start,
but only a little fainter. But after it begins to fall in temperature,
while still contracting, the situation is different. There are now
fewer square miles in its surface, and less light given out per square
mile, so that its light will fall off rapidly, and it will grow fainter
and redder until at last it disappears.

During its history, therefore, it will pass through any surface
temperature lower than the maximum twice—once when of large
diameter, low density, great luminosity, and rising temperature, and
again when its diameter is small, density high, luminosity low, and
temperature falling. It is obvious that these contrasted groups of
characteristics are exactly those which differentiate the giant and
dwarf stars. The theoretical and observed pictures, indeed, agree
not merely in their general outlines, but in every detail. For ex-
ample, the lower the temperature selected for study, the greater will
be the theoretical difference between the groups of stars of rising
and falling temperature, and the greater is the actual difference be-
tween the giant and dwarf stars. The approximate equality in
brightness among the giant stars of the various spectral classes, and
the great differences among the dwarfs, find also a complete expla-
nation.

Stars of large mass, as can easily be shown, should attain a greater
maximum temperature than those whose mass is smaller, and should
be more luminous than the latter, for the same surface temperature,
especially in the giant stages. The great masses and luminosities of
the B stars are thus accounted for. They are not massive because
they are hot, but hot because they are massive. Lesser masses never
attain the B stage of temperature, but stop at A; and still smaller
ones may not get beyond class F, or even G. ‘As we go down the
spectral series, therefore, we are continually adding to our list stars
of mass too small to get into any of our earlier groups at all—so it
is no wonder that the average mass decreases for the redder stars.
The fact that the masses of the giants average high, whatever their
spectral type, is probably an effect of observational selection. We
have picked them from a list of naked-eye stars, and hence from one
CONSTITUTION OF THE STARS—RUSSELL 149

in which the brighter stars have an egregious preference, and it has
already been seen that, in these stages, great brightness means large
mass.

A more searching test is found in the densities of stars of the vari-
ous sorts; for here we can make our comparison quantitative in-
stead of merely qualitative. The stars of increasing temperature
should have densities at which the simple gas laws can be trusted
to apply, at least approximately; the dwarfs should be so dense that
we can be sure that these laws fail of application; while the hottest
stars should have an intermediate density corresponding to the
region in which the gas laws are strikingly at work. From a general
knowledge of the properties of matter, we can say with certainty
that a density less than ten times that of air falls in the first class,
one greater than that of water in the second, while the “ twilight
zone ” between corresponds to densities in the neighborhood of one-
tenth to one-quarter that of water, and perhaps a little higher. Now
we have already seen that the redder giant stars are less dense than
air—the whiter ones being probably from ten to fifty times denser;
that the average density of the A stars is one-fifth that of the sun,
or one-third that of water, while their individual densities range
from about fifty times that of air to that of water, and that the
dwarf stars have densities running from about that of water up
to four or five times as much. The agreement is perfect throughout
and there can be no remaining doubt that the proposed physical
model represents what actually happens in the stars.

This theory of stellar evolution was first propounded by Sir Nor-
man Lockyer, who outlines clearly the physical processes involved.
His criteria for distinguishing between stars of rising and falling
temperature were spectroscopic, and chosen in a rather arbitrary
way, with little explanation (though they were not very far fron.
anticipating Adams’ later discovery), and his views failed of
general acceptance. It fell to the speaker’s lot, some years later, tc
revive the theory, and point out the importance of the absolute
magnitudes, which, indeed, furnish the key to the whole problem.
This invaluable aid was not available when Lockyer began his
work—for in those days little indeed was known of stellar paral-
laxes—so that it is not surprising that his individual assignments
of stars to the classes of rising and falling temperature are ofter
erroneous. With the wealth of material now available, it is an easy
matter to point out stars in every successive stage of evolution, and
to assign the large majority of those for which we have data to
their place in its sequence. Mention should again be made, how-
ever, of the few, faint, but perplexing white stars of low luminosity.

1454—25——11
150 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

These do not fit into the scheme at all, and they present such an
extraordinary combination of high temperature, small luminosity,
and considerable mass that it is very difficult to form any consistent
idea of the physical conditions which exist on their surfaces. ‘There
are indeed more worlds for theory to conquer—and some of them
look as if it would take hard fighting.

But there are other ways in which our knowledge of the properties
of matter may be applied to the stars. A simple calculation shows
that the gravitational pressure at the center of the sun must be some-
thing like a hundred million tons per square inch. The pressures
in other dwarf stars are of the same order of magnitude. Those in
giant stars are smaller, but are usually measurable in thousands of
tons per square inch, even when the density can not be many times
greater than that of air. To withstand such a pressure, at this
density, the gas must have a temperature of many millions of
degrees.

What can we say of the properties which matter would exhibit
at these temperatures? Twenty years ago the only answer would
have been, “ Very little”; but now, with our knowledge of atomic
structure, we can say a good deal. The extreme violence of the
collisions between the atoms would knock off all the electrons of
the outer shells, and keep them off. The lighter atoms—perhaps as
far as sodium or even beyond—would lose all their electrons, and
be reduced to bare nuclei. The heavier ones would retain their
innermost one or two rings or shells of electrons, but lose the outer
ones, which contain a considerable majority of the whole number
of electrons originally present. We can be certain, however, that
the nuclei themselves would emerge quite unscathed from these col-
lisions, and that if an isolated nucleus, or the battered fragment of
a heavier atom, had a brief interval of relative quiet it would begin
to pick up electrons again from those which passed by slowly enough,
and to reconstitute the atomic structure. Could we remove a por-
tion of the matter in this strange state and let it cool, the familiar
atoms would thereupon rebuild themselves, bit by bit, and at the
end they would be the same as ever.

The principal differences at the high temperature, from our
present standpoint, are, first, there would be a vast multitude of
free electrons flying about, as well as the far heavier atomic nuclei,
so that the average “molecular weight”—in determining which
every free-moving particle in the gas counts as much as any other—
would be much diminished: Secondly, the gas at this temperature
would emit a tremendous flood of radiation, most of it of such short
wave length that it would resemble X rays rather than ordinary
light. This radiation would not go very far before it was scattered
CONSTITUTION OF THE STARS—RUSSELL 151

in all directions by the electrons, or absorbed in detaching some
fast-knit electron from the remnant of an atom, only to be re-
emitted when recombination took place. In either case the energy
would be relayed back and forth from atom to atom, now in this
direction, again in that, until in the lapse of ages it leaked gradually
outward to the cooler parts of the star, on its way to the surface.

Jeans was, I believe, the first to call attention to this extraordinary
state of things, and Schwarzschild to point out the fundamental im-
portance of the exchange of radiation in determining the conditions
of equilibrium within a star; but the general solution of the problem
came later, from Eddington, who was the first to appreciate one of
its most fundamental features.

The flood of entrapped radiation, in its attempts to escape, exerts
a pressure outward in all directions, just as a compressed gas would
do. The existence of this radiation pressure was pointed out long
ago by Maxwell’s theory of light. With any light obtainable on |
earth, even full sunlight, it is so minute that apparatus of the most.
delicate sort is required to indicate its existence; but at the tempera-
tures which prevail inside the stars it may amount (as Eddington
pointed out) to hundreds of tons per square inch and be an important
factor in preventing the collapse of the star’s interior under the
weight of the outer parts. Indeed, under some conditions, it may do
more than the gas pressure due to the motions of the atoms and
electrons, huge as the latter is. Following this lead, and working out
the laws of flow of energy outward down the temperature gradient,
he showed that certain simple and probable assumptions about the
opacity of the medium led to the conclusion that, all through the
star, the gravitational pressure would be proportional to the fourth
power of the temperature, and that the shares of this pressure which
were sustained by the gas pressure and the radiation pressure would
be everywhere in the same ratio. These conditions, combined with the
law of gravitation and the gas laws, suffice to determine completely
the model upon which the star is built, and to tell us practically all
that we need to know about it.

For the case where the simple gas laws hold, the mathematical
work had already been done by Emden, who found that the outer
regions of the star were of very low density, while there was a rapid
concentration toward the center, where the density reaches fifty-four
times the mean density. The central temperature of such a star
obeys Lane’s law, while the surface brightness varies inversely in the
square root of the radius. This means that the whole amount of
energy radiated from the star’s surface will be independent of its
size—the increase in surface brightness and decrease in area, as it
contracts, balancing one another exactly. The amount of the star’s
radiation depends upon the opacity of its material—diminishing as
152 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

this increases—and is also proportional to the ratio which the radia-
tion pressure bears to the total pressure at any part inside the star.
This ratio increases rapidly with the star’s mass, and the brightness
should do the same.

These conclusions form a theory of giant stars. To extend it to
dwarf stars Eddington repeated his calculations, taking into ac-
count the manner in which the compressibility of a gas decreases
with increasing density, and obtained a theoretical table which rep-
resents the way in which the absolute magnitude and temperature
of a star should depend upon its mass and density throughout the
whole range of these quantities. This table reproduces the actual
characteristics.of the dwarf stars and those of maximum tempera-
ture, as well as the giants, with a fidelity which is almost uncanny,
and far more than justifies its author’s modest claim that the theory
upon which it is based “ gives a fair approximation to the facts.”

But Eddington’s theory goes beyond this. It actually shows us
why the masses of the stars are so much alike, and why they are of
their actual order of magnitude. If @ is the fraction of the whole
pressure within the star which is balanced by the gas pressure, leav-
ing the fraction 1—§ for the radiation pressure, he derives by reason-
ing of a very general character, the equation

“Fe = 4.6 X 10-8 M?

where J/ is the mass of the star in grams. The extraordinarily small
numerical coefficient depends only upon a few very fundamental
natural constants—the gravitational constant, the quantum, and the
average mass of one of the “molecules” in the star (including in
this term atoms, nuclei, and free electrons). The numerical value
here given depends on the assumption that the last quantity is 2.8
times the mass of a hydrogen atom, an estimate which must be nearly
correct if the atoms are dissociated into nuclei and electrons to the
degree which has been described.

Now, following Eddington’s argument, we may imagine a set of
spheres-of gas, each isolated in space and in equilibrium under its
own gravitation and radiation, the first mass of 10 grams, the next
100 grams, the third 1,000 grams, and so on. Then, by means of his
equation, we find that the proportion which the radiation pressure
bears to the whole will be quite negligible in all the spheres up to
No. 32, will increase rapidly for Nos. 33 and 34; while for sphere
35 and all those beyond it the radiation pressure will be the dom-
inant partner, leaving little for the gas pressure to do.

Upon this long line of spheres, therefore, we find a small region
in which a certain natural factor changes from an insignificant to a
controlling réle. On general physical principles, therefore, as Ed-
CONSTITUTION OF THE STARS—RUSSELL 153

dington puts it, we would expect “something to happen” in this
critical interval, and “ what happens is the stars.” It is only when
the radiation pressure and the gas pressure share the gravitational
food that we get anything that can fairly be called a star. Smaller
masses do not give out light enough to make them visible at inter-
stellar distances, while the great ones, in which the radiation pres-
sure is almost sufficient to counteract gravitation, would be in an
almost unstable condition, so that a small disturbance, such as might
be produced by a moderate rotation, would cause them to break up
into parts. Hence smaller masses do not shine, and bigger ones
break up, and only those in the critical intervening range of mass
remain as luminous stars. We have seen that this should occur for
masses comparable with those of spheres 83 and 34 of the series.
Now the first of these is of half the mass of the sun, and the second
has five times the sun’s mass, so that the actual masses of the stars
fall very exactly into the range indicated by the theory. Since the
constants of this theory are derived from those which are the most
fundamental in modern physics, we may truthfully say that the
masses, and hence the sizes and brightness of the stars are deter-
mined directly by the fundamental properties of the very atoms
of which they are composed. It may be shown, for example, from
Eddington’s equation, that a mass of gas will shine as a giant star
when, and only when, the ratio of the diameter of the star to the
average distance between the atoms which compose it is about 20
times'the ratio between the charge of an electron and the average
mass of an atom (provided that this mass is measured, not in the
ordinary way, but, as in the electrical case, by its power of attract-
ing a similar mass at a given distance). The latter ratio is very
large, about 410’, so that the number of atoms in the star is enor-
mous, and the star itself a very large mass.

One of the most impressive consequences of the whole theory is
that the masses of the stars are determined by the interplay of
the two forces, gravitation and radiation pressure, which, among all
those in nature, are so feeble, under the conditions of ordinary ex-
periment, that it taxes the skill of the experimenter to build an
apparatus delicate enough to measure the effects of either one. Were
we confined to experiments in enclosed laboratories, isolated in space,
without the earth’s attraction to prove to us the existence of gravi-
tation, it would probably have been long before the very existence
of either of these forces would have been suspected; yet these forces,
and these alone, when working on the grand scale, are powerful
enough to shape the stars.

One question still remains. How long a time is required for
this sequence of evolutionary changes? What is the life of a star?
154 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Here, again, the answer which we would now give depends upon
knowledge which has come within the last decade or two. We have,
even now, no direct evidence regarding the age of the stars, or the
sun; but we have information about the age of the earth that has
magnified our conception of the duration of the universe in time, in
as startling a fashion as the study of the globular clusters has en-
larged our idea of its extension in space.

The new method of measuring time is really very simple. Ura-
nium is radioactive, and slowly “decays.” One by one its atoms
eject a part of their nuclei, and change into atoms of a different
element. These again break up, and so on through a long and
wonderful series of transformations, in which radium is one step.
The particle ejected from the nucleus is sometimes an electron, but
oftener an alpha particle, identical with the nucleus of a helium
atom. Finally, at the end of the list, there remains a stable atom of
lead—but not of ordinary lead, for its atomic weight is 206, instead
of 207 as usual. In the course of ages, this radio-lead must accumu-
late in all uranium minerals. The rate of accumulation is accurately
known, from a study of radioactive phenomena and we can be sure
that the weight of lead produced in a million years is one eight-
thousandth of that of the uranium which is present. By determin-
ing the percentages of uranium and lead now present in a mineral,
and applying this principle, we can find out how old the mineral
is—provided, of course, that it contained no lead when it was origi-
nally formed by crystallization in the molten rock mass. Such
primitive lead would, however, be ordinary lead, of higher atomic
weight, and a determination of the atomic weight of the lead de-
rived from our specimen will enable us to tell how much of it was
there when the mineral formed, and how much has been produced by
radioactivity since this time.

In this way reliable values can be obtained for the ages of various
minerals, and the dates of the eruption of the rocks in which they
occur. The latter can often be defined in geological terms, and
hence we can date the various geologic periods, finding a good
general agreement with the geological order of succession. The
oldest minerals so far studied are found in rocks of Middle Pre-
Cambrian age. Specimens from Europe. Africa, and America agree
in giving ages of between 1,000 and 1,200 millions of years. These
individual crystals have been in the rocks for all this time. The
earth, as a planet, must be older. The speaker, from consideration
of the whole amount of uranium and lead in the earth’s crust, showed
last year that its age is apparently less than eight billions of years,
and probably something like 4 billions. If, as seems most probable,
the planets were produced by eruptions from the sun, under the tidal
CONSTITUTION OF THE STARS—RUSSELL 155

influence of a passing star, the sun itself must have been already
formed at that remote epoch.

But we may go further. Life already existed on the earth in
Cambrian times, and it is a moderate estimate to say that the process
of organic evolution has lasted for a billion years. During all this
time the sun can never have been one stellar magnitude brighter
or fainter than it is now; for in the first case, its heat would have
raised the oceans to the boiling point, and, in the second, they would
have frozen solid—and either of these catastrophes would have put
an end to evolution and to all terrestrial life. Now the sun is a
typical dwarf star, and there is good reason to believe that it is now
well advanced in cooling and was once much brighter and hotter
than it is now—of class F, at least, though perhaps not of class A.
At such a time it must have been at least two magnitudes brighter
than at present. Yet in the whole of geological time it has probably
decreased half a magnitude or less. We may, therefore, say, with
considerable confidence, that the life of the sun, and doubtless also
of the stars in general, must extend over many billions of years.

But here we meet with a serious difficulty. We know the rate
at which the sun is radiating energy to the earth, and, from con-
sideration of the way in which the earth in turn radiates this energy
into space, we can be sure that the sun is also sending out an equal
amount of heat into space in every direction. The total output is
so great that it would exhaust the whole huge fund of energy which
would be made available by the sun’s contraction from an indefinitely
extended size, in about twenty million years, as Lord Kelvin showed
long ago. When we allow for the fact that some of this heat is
still stored in the sun’s interior, and that it was probably much
brighter in its earlier stages of evolution than at present, we see
that, if gravitational energy alone was available as the source of its
radiation, the sun’s past life as a star must have occupied but a very
few million years. In view of the geological and radioactive evi-
dence, there seems to be no escape from the conclusion that the sun
must have some other, and far greater, store of internal energy upon
which to draw.

Further evidence in favor of this view has been found by Edding-
ton in the behavior of the star Delta Cephei. This is a typical giant
star, about eight hundred times as bright as the sun. Eddington has
given good reason to believe that the cause of its variation in light
is a periodic expansion and contraction of the whole star by about
10 per cent on each side of the mean. The period of this change
would depend on the density of the star, and diminish if this im-
creased. Hence, if the mean diameter was gradually contracting,
the period should shorten. Eddington calculates that, if the radia-
tion is supplied by gravitational contraction alone, the period should

156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

decrease by about 40 seconds per year. The observations, which
cover more than a century, show indeed a decrease of period, but
at the rate of about a second in 12 years—five hundred times slower
than the previous theory would demand. Here again we have evi-
dence that the rate of stellar evolution—in a giant star this time—is
many hundreds of times slower than it would be if there was not
some internal store of energy to draw upon.

It is certain that no corresponding evolution of heat from any
source occurs within the earth, and we must therefore suppose that
energy from the “unknown source” becomes available only at
exceedingly high temperatures, such as prevail inside the stars. But
if this is the case, and a star, in contracting, gets hot enough inside
to start this process going, why does this not make the interior
still hotter, and so cause a still more rapid transformation of the
unknown energy into heat, till the process ends in an explosion on
wu colossal scale? I mulled over this idea for a couple of years
before I saw the simple answer. If heat energy is supplied to the
interior of a giant star, the star will have to expand, and if it ex-
pands, it must grow cooler. The process is the exact reverse of
that by which contraction makes the star hotter, and at the same
time compels the escape of heat from the surface into space. Hence,
if too much heat is supplied from the unknown source, the star
will expand and cool, shutting off further supplies. It is easy to
see that we have here a self-regulating process, which, in the long
run, will automatically adjust the supply of heat in the interior
so that it just makes up the loss due to leakage toward the surface
and radiation into space. In the short run, we might find alternate
overproduction, leading to expansion of the star and cooling, and
underproduction, permitting contraction and heating; and oscilla-
tions of just this sort appear to happen in the Cepheid variables.
Though the star may thus be kept shining for a very long time, it
can not go on forever, for the store of internal energy, however
vast, must be finite, and will gradually be used up. As this hap-
pens, the star will contract, although very slowly, and ultimately pass
through the various giant and dwarf stages, in substantially the man-
ner which was described earlier.

Such a store of available energy will account for the facts; but
how shall we attempt to account for the store of energy itself? One
thing is clear at the start. The only places small enough to contain
so huge an accumulation are the nuclei of the atoms. I say “small”
advisedly, for it is only when the constituent parts of which the
atoms are built come exceedingly close together that the forces be-
tween them can become great enough to account for their possession
of such an amount of energy. Radioactive energy, which comes
CONSTITUTION OF THE STARS—RUSSELL t57

trom atomic nuclei, represents indeed one such gigantic store. But
the amount of energy which must once have been stored in each
gram of the sun’s mass, to account for its past radiation of heat, is
even greater than that contained in uranium. We can not do more
than guess where it may have been hidden; but one verv recent piece
of work affords a possible clue.

Aston, in one of the brilliant researches which we have learned
to associate with the Cavandish Laboratory at Cambridge, has in-
vented a beautiful apparatus which sorts atoms, by giving them elec-
trical charges and shooting them through a vacuum under the in-
fluence of electric and magnetic fields. The resulting forces deflect
atoms of different weights in different directions, and bring each
kind to a separate focus upon a photographic plate, producing
images when the plate is developed. By measuring these plates the
atomic weights may be determined; and Aston has found that, in
every case but one, the true atomic weights are exact integers,
within the accuracy of measurement, which is about 1 part in 1,000.
When the chemist finds an atomic weight which is not an integer,
such as 35.46 for chlorine, this is really the average for two different
kinds of atoms of the same chemical properties, but different weights,
both of which are integers—35 and 37 in this case. The one ex-
ception is hydrogen, for which the chemist’s determination 1.008 is
exactly confirmed.

Now it is more than a century since Prout suggested that, since
the atomic weights are so nearly integers, the atoms themselves are
built up out of simple units. We now transfer this idea to the
atomic nuclei, which contain practically all the mass, and Aston’s
beautiful researches practically compel belief. The hydrogen nucleus,
or “ proton,” is the lightest of all, and we would naturally look
to it as the fundamental unit. Rutherford’s success in knocking
the nuclei of elements such as oxygen, nitrogen, and sodium to bits,
by collision with fast-moving alpha particles, has furnished a
definite proof that protons, and alpha particles as well, are actual
constitutents of these nuclei. Many nuclei must also contain elec-
trons, which prevent the net electric charge from getting too high.
It looks, for example, as if an alpha particle was built of four
protons and two electrons, held together by forces of whose nature
we are ignorant. This would give exactly the right electric charge;
but the mass of the four protons would be greater than that of
the alpha particle by 1 part in 130. (The electrons weigh next to
nothing.) This seems to spoil the explanation altogether, but an
escape is found in that great resolver of otherwise intractable dif-
ficulties, the principle of relativity. According to this, all energy
has mass, and all mass is equivalent to energy. The loss of mass in

1454—25——_12
158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

the formation of the alpha particle would mean that, in forming it,
energy would be liberated, which would have to be put back into
it again in order to separate the parts. The calculated amount of
energy is so enormously great that it is not at all surprising that the
alpha particle is so stable. Even in the collisions with other atomic
nuclei which shatter the latter into fragments, the forces (which can
be roughly calculated) are not nearly strong enough to disintegrate
it.

We may now suppose that, in the interior of the stars, and by
some process the details of which are still quite unknown, the atoms
of hydrogen are taken apart, and the pieces—protons and electrons—
built up into the nuclei of heavier atoms, with just enough elec-
trons left over to build the outer parts of these. We can not be
sure, of course, that such a thing actually happens; but if it does,
the energy liberated will suffice for the present demands of astro-
physics. If the sun, for example, was originally all hydrogen,
which was transformed in this fashion into other elements, the
energy which would be set free as a by-product would keep it
shining at the present rate for about 120 billions of years.

Such is our present conception of the stars, their distance, their
age, their nature, and their life history. In the grandeur of its
sweep in space and time, and the beauty and simplicity of the re-
lations which it discloses between the greatest and the smallest
things of which we know, it reveals as perhaps nothing else does,
the majesty of the order about us which we call nature, and, as I
believe, of that Power behind the order, of which it is but a passing
shadow.

THE SUN AND SUNSPOTS, 1820-1920?

By E. WALTER MAUNDER

[With 7 plates]

The Royal Astronomical Society was founded in 1820. At that
date it was known that there was a sun, that sometimes there were
spots upon its surface, and that the sun rotated on its axis. Prac-
tically that was all.

In 1826, the systematic study of the sun’s surface was commenced
by Schwabe, and it has been continued up to the present time.
Schwabe presented his drawings to the Royal Astronomical Society ;
and as it also possesses those of some of his predecessors in the same
field, this society now holds records of one kind or another showing
the changes that have taken place upon the solar surface from the
year 1820, and so continuously to the present date.

The question before us this evening is: What views do we now hold
of the constitution of the sun and the relationships of its spots, and
upon what facts do we base them?

A quarter of an hour is a short time in which to review the scien-
tific evolution of a century, even when the inquiry is restricted to a
single department of astronomy, so confined that it deals only with
sunspots as drawn at the telescope, or impressed upon the photo-
graph plate.

My first illustration (fig. 1) deals with the annual percentages of
spotless days, 1826-1923, and is an extension of that appearing in the
Monthly Notices, 74, Plate 4, between pages 114 and 115. It is based
upon Schwabe’s persistent daily count of sunspots. In itself, his
work was very simple and straightforward, but it was carried on
systematically and with the utmost patience. These qualities made
it great and epoch making, and they were acknowledged by the
award to him, in 1857, of the gold medal of this society.

The diagram is deduced, partly from the observations of Schwabe;
partly from those of R. Wolf; and from 1885 to the present time
from the Greenwich Photoheliographic Results. It exhibits for each

year from 1826 to 1923 the percentage of the days of observation
upon which the sun appeared to be free from spots. It shows clearly
that all years are not equally prolific as to sunspots. Confining
ourselves to the years represented, it appears that there were eight
cycles completed when there was a most marked absence of spots; a
ninth cycle being now nearly completed. The dates of such absences
are very clearly defined and are marked by the actual year inserted
just above the apices. In the ninety-eight years represented there
is in no case any doubt as to the year of the greatest solar quiescence,
and a simple examination of the curve demonstrates that the average
length of the interval, from one year of greatest quiescence to the
next, was nearly 111% years, and that the range in length of that in-
terval was from 10 to 13 years.

This interval is often spoken of as “the sun-spot period.” The use
_of the word “ period” has been unfortunate, for it has given rise to
an impression which is not in accord with the facts of the case.
Let us speak of it in future as “the sun-spot cycle.” A series of
events may be, and often is, “cyclical” without being in the usual
mathematical sense “ periodic”; but we are not, at present, justified
in applying the term “ period,” in its strictest mathematical sense,
to the interval that occurs between one sun-spot minimum and the
next.

The second illustration (fig. 2) gives a somewhat fuller study,
derived from the measures of the areas of sunspots made at Green-
wich Observatory on the photographs of the sun, taken during the
years 1874-1923; it is an extension of a similar diagram given in the
Monthly Notices, 64, page 748. It exhibits the mean daily spotted
THE SUN AND SUNSPOTS—MAUNDER 161

area of the sun; the total mean spotted area of the northern
hemisphere being shown separately from that of the southern.
The principal feature of the diagram therefore is the comparison of
the sun-spot areas in the two hemispheres. From this point of
view the diagram is worth careful consideration. Just as the first
illustration showed that during the years represented there was only
one sun-spot cycle—a cycle having a mean duration of about 1114
years—so the present diagram shows that the cycle holds good for
each hemisphere, as well as for both together. The solar cycle is one.
There is no question of the existence of submultiple cycles, or of
incommensurable cycles of greater length.

Further examination of the diagram shows that the maximum
activity in any particular cycle does not necessarily fall at the same
epoch for the two hemispheres; rather, a divergency appears between
them. In each of the four cycles represented, the northern activity
was developed before the southern; in each of them the curve in one
hemisphere attained a single crest, while in the other it attained a
double one; or, to put it in other words, the form of the curve was
not the same in the two hemispheres. We have therefore here a
solar dichotomy displayed. Had the results of the whole century
been presented in a like form, other peculiarities would have been
seen, but these would have strengthened, not weakened, the case
for the solar dichotomy. The solar cycle is one; its manifestations
in the two hemispheres, north and south, are different.
162 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

The third diagram (fig. 8) is an extension of that appearing in
the Monthly Notices, 74, Plate 3, between pages 114 and 115, and
brings out another relation. The solar dichotomy is not illustrated
here; we are dealing with the whole of the sun’s disk as we see it.
The points set forth are the variations in the area covered by sun-
spots, and the variations in the mean distance from the equator of
the sun of all spots. Area and latitude are the two factors brought
into notice. The period covered by the diagram is 1854-1923. The
statistics for the first two cycles are derived from the work of the
late Professor Spoerer; for the last four, from the Greenwich
Photoheliographic Results.

The continuous line shows the variation in the total daily spotted
area of the sun during the progress of each cycle; the dotted line

shows the changing distance from the solar equator of the center of
gravity of the sun-spot zones. In this latter curve, we have the
fact that the solar cycle is one, and one only, brought out in a most
unmistakable fashion; each cycle begins with an activity in high
latitude ; each cycle ends with the last remnants of activity transferred
to a low one; but, as the new cycle begins before the old cycle has
completed its course, the two overlap for a short time. This is what
is known as “Spoerer’s law of zones.” Broadly speaking, we may
say that the approach toward the equator is continuous from the
beginning of the cycle to its end. The distinction between the forms
of the two curves is emphatic. The area curve is continuous; it
begins practically at zero; it increases up to a certain point; it then
diminishes again to the next zero; and soon. Flow and ebb, flow and
ebb, follow each other continuously. But the latitude curve is dis-
THE SUN AND SUNSPOTS—MAUNDER 163

continuous. It always starts from high latitude; when it has reached
low latitudes it is cut off; there is no gradual return to the high
latitudes. The reappearance of spots in high latitudes is sudden.

There are now three facts before us. There is one solar cycie,
shown differently, in time and form of the curve, in the two hemi-
spheres, and now in two manifestations of quite separate character ;
one in area, a complete pulsation, and one in latitude, which moves
in one direction only; i. e., from high solar latitudes to low.

The fourth illustration (fig. 4) appeared in the Monthly Notices,
74, Plate 2, between pages 114 and 115. It deals only with the
distribution of spots in latitude, nothing being shown concerning the
areas of spots. The materials are drawn entirely from the Green-
wich Photoheliographic Results, and extend over the years 1874-1913.
Seven thousand spots are represented, but the short straight line
which indicates the latitude of a spot is drawn just as long and
as heavy for a small spot as for a large one; for one spot as for a
dozen. All spots occurring during the same rotation of the sun are
represented in the same vertical line. The diagram is concerned
only with the distribution of spot centers in heliographic latitude.

This diagram has been familiarly called “the butterfly diagram,”
as it seems to suggest three butterflies pinned down to a board with
their wings extended. Heads, bodies, and legs have disappeared,
but the outstretched wings remain. Each pair of wings is distinct
from the next; there is a clear V-shaped gap between each of the
three specimens. Here again the first deduction is reinforced from
an altogether different set of facts. The solar cycle is one.

This diagram further suggests that the origin of the solar spots
lies within the sun, not without. They come from below the sur-
face; they are not impressed upon the surface by some exterior
influence; neither by planets nor by meteors. No exterior influence
could invariably begin a fresh disturbance in a high latitude simul-
taneously on both sides of the Equator.

If we take a card with a narrow slit in it, parallel to the sun’s
equator, and move it up and down over the diagram, then, wherever
that slit is placed within the range of the sun-spot zones, the three
sun-spot cycles will be brought out clearly and unmistakably. Our
first conclusion, that the sun-spot cycle is one, is now extended; it is
true not merely for sunspots in general, but for the spots of any
special zone in particular. This conclusion goes deeper than our first,
which was merely that the sun-spot cycle, on the average, lasted for
about 1114 years. The sun as a whole is under the law of that cycle,
and edth individual zone has its own particular part to play in it.
But the sun as a whole is a unit, no matter how distinct its dichotomy
into two hemispheres, no matter how distinct may be the action in
any particular zone.

THE SUN AND SUNSPOTS—MAUNDER 165

Another feature is suggested by this diagram, but will be better
brought out in a different connection. It is that the southern hemi-
sphere appears to encroach slightly on the northern at the equator,
or at about the time of the close of one cycle and the beginning of the
next. The southern influence seems to cross the equator.

Since the origin of the solar spots les within the sun, and the
northern and southern spots show differences in their behavior, we
must conclude that the sun is not symmetrical in the constitution of
its interior. If then we assume, as the basis of any investigation,
that the sun is symmetrical in its internal constitution, we are making
an assumption contrary te the evidence supplied by the behavior of
1ts surface.

If there be this clear distinction between the two hemispheres, is it
possible that one of them might go out of action for a time, and if so,
what would follow?

This is not a mere oratorical question; the event supposed has
actually occurred. Dr. Rudolf Wolf, of Zurich, demonstrated, and
Spoerer developed that demonstration further, that in the latter part
of the seventeenth century and the beginning of the eighteenth the
northern hemisphere of the sun failed for many years to produce a
single recorded spot.

Was there any effect during that same period recognized here on
the earth that could be plausibly associated with this failure in spot
production in the sun’s northern hemisphere?

It is suggestive that, while the northern hemisphere was thus en-
tirely barren, the southern hemisphere of the sun had some spots, but
only few, and for nearly 70 years the sun showed a prolonged spot
minimum. ‘The failure in spot activity of the northern hemisphere
was not compensated by an increased activity in the southern.
Further, as Miss Agnes Clerke pointed out in Knowledge for Sep-
tember, 1894, no aurore were reported during these years; from
which we may infer that there were no great magnetic disturbances
taking place on the earth. It is also suggestive that Prof. A. E.
Douglass, who has been studying with great particularity the annual
rings of trees in relation to climate and the solar activity (Climatic
Cycles and Tree Growths), found that this same period “ was the
interval in the yellow pines” (i. e. of northern Arizona) “ which
gave me more trouble than any other in trying to work out the action
of the sun-spot cycle” (Journal of the British Astronomical Asso-
ciation, 32, 223). Professor Douglass added that it seemed to him
“a very important corroboration of the relationship between solar
activity and terrestrial conditions, for I presume that these tree
variations are related directly to the weather.”
166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Sunspots, if looked at casually, appear to differ widely in their
form and behavior, but a little systematic observation shows that, for
the most part, they conform in their history to a single type. As an
illustration we may take the group which attained its maximum de-
velopment in March, 1920, and of which the Rev. A. L. Cortie has
summarized the life history in the Monthly Notices, 80, 574-578,
where it is accompanied by seven drawings of its appearance. This
type is that of a more or less regular stream, of which the first and
last spots are usually the largest, best defined, and the most stable.
The straight line joiming the two chief spots—sometimes distin-
guished as the “leader” and “ trailer ”—was in this case parallel to
the sun’s equator.

Professor Hale has shown that all spots contain magnetic fields,
and that the strength of this field (up to a certain maximum) in-
creases with the diameter of the spot; and that the polarities in any
one cycle follow a definite law with respect to the position of the
spot on the sun according as it is north or south of the equator. If
the sign of the dominant charge remains always the same, then
opposite polarities may be regarded as representing opposite direc-
tions of whirl. Now in streams in which the “leader” and the
“trailer” are dominant, Professor Hale has pointed out that these
two are of opposite polarities; that is, of opposite directions of
whirl. Where, then, we have two “ bipolar ” streams, one north and
one south of the solar equator, we find that the two leaders have
whirls in directions opposite to each other, and, similarly, the two
“trailers” have whirls opposite. Further, during the cycle ending
in 1918, the leader spots in the northern and the trailer spots in the
southern hemisphere were of negative polarity; the sign of the
polarity being positive for the southern leaders and northern trailers.
But during the cycle after 1914, these relative whirls were inter-
changed, the northern leaders and southern trailers becoming positive
and the southern leaders and northern trailers negative, until June
24, 1922, when a small single spot (probably a leading spot whose
trailer had become invisible) in north latitude 31°, was found to have
south or negative polarity. This was the first indication that the
new cycle just beginning was again experiencing a general reversal
of polarities.

Thus during the minimum years of 1913-14 and of 1922-24, we
have not only the high latitude spots of the new cycle overlapping the
low latitude spots of the old, but also four spot zones, characterized
by distinct magnetic polarities coexisting together. But the general
magnetic field of the sun shows no reversal of polarity.

Professor Hale also points out (Contributions from Mount Wilson
Solar Observatory, No. 165) that the inclination of the axis of the
spot stream, which is in general represented by the line joining the
THE SUN AND SUNSPOTS—MAUNDER 167

“leader” and the “trailer,” bears a definite relation to the latitude
at which it occurs. The “trailer” tends to be further from the
equator than the “leader,” and “in low latitudes the axes are nearly
parallel to the sun’s equator; but with increasing latitude the mean
inclination increases to a maximum of about 11°” in the region of
latitude 30° to 35°.

To go back in the history nearly 60 years, one of the most notable
contributions to the answer to the question “ What is a sun?” was
supplied by the Redhill Observations of Sunspots made by R. C.

Carrington in the years 1853-1861, in which he redetermined the posi-
tion of the sun’s axis and the rotation period of the sun. In par-
ticular, he showed that each different zone of latitude, north and
south, has its own rotation period. The annexed diagram (fig. 5)
will roughly illustrate the general effect. It is drawn on the assump-
tion that there is a spot in every fifth degree of latitude, and that at
a given moment these 17 spots were all observed to be on the central
meridian of the sun’s apparent disk. If, then, each spot traveled
westward with the average speed of apparent motion appropriate to
its own particular latitude, then in 27% days the spots would be
found in the positions indicated on the curved line.
168 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

lieferring again to “the butterfly diagram,” the shift of the
habitat of spot groups during the progress of the solar cycle shown
therein would appear to be a sort of surface ripple on the sun, mov-
ing in both hemispheres from high latitudes to low, as each cycle
proceeds from its beginning to its close. The case of the Cepheid
variables has made us familiar in recent years with the idea of stars
which change their volume—stars with pulsating photospheres. In
the sun we have, as yet, no proof of a general pulsation of the photo-
sphere; only of this ripple of disturbance on its surface. But, since
the rotation period, as indicated by sunspots, is shorter as the
equator is approached, it follows that the mean rotation period of the
sun is quicker before minimum than after.

But the above diagram puts the fact of the difference in the rota-
tion periods of different latitudes in much too crude a form. A
paper on “ The solar rotation period from Greenwich sun-spot meas-
ures, 1879-1901,” appeared in the Monthly Notices, 65, and on page
817 a table was given (Table IL) which was intended to show how
wide are the differences of rotation period, as derived from different
spot groups even in the same latitude. Every group has a proper
motion of its own; even within the same group there are internal
movements. The leader spot in the early days of a group tends to
rush forward over the surface; in the group’s later history to slacken
speed and return on its track.? Also the groups which live the
longest, returning two or more times to the visible hemisphere of the
sun, move more slowly on the whole than short-lived spots, and yield
different rotation periods during their successive apparitions.

One remarkable peculiarity is common to both the cycles, 1879-
1891 and 1891-1901, and since it was brought out by Carrington’s
inquiry two cycles earlier it is probable that it expresses a real pecu-
liarity of the solar rotation. In spite of the great irregularity in
the rotation periods given by the spots in any particular zone, there
does appear to be a distinct tendency for the shortest mean period to
be given, not at the equator, but slightly to the north of it. The curve
given by the different rotation periods is not precisely symmetrical
with respect to the equator, and, on the whole, there appears to be a
tendency for the periods in the northern latitudes to lengthen more
rapidly with distance from the equator than with those of the southern.
A similar feature was suggested in “ the butterfly diagram,” wherein
the southern hemisphere appeared to encroach slightly on the northern
at the equator. The equator of rotation would appear not to coincide
with the equator of figure, but to lie slightly to the north of it.*

difference of its observed rate of motion from the general surface
drift.

The seventh diagram is drawn upon precisely the same scale as
figure 6, and shows the distribution of certain solar longitudes. But
these are not longitudes of spots on the sun, but of the center of the
sun’s disk at the moment when a magnetic storm began to be felt upon
the earth. In this case every magnetic storm is recorded. It will be
seen how similar is the character of the associated dots in the two
figures; even though no spots are given in figure 6 that made only
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

one appearance. If the single appearances in figure 7 had been
omitted, the resemblance between the two diagrams would have been
much increased. In other words, the intervals between the successive
returns of a group of spots to the center of the sun’s disk, as seen
from the earth, are strictly comparable with the intervals between
the recurrences of a magnetic storm. Magnetic storms obey the law
of the sun’s rotation.

This could not be so if the influence that brings about our magnetic
storms proceeded equally from every part of the solar surface and
was radiated from it equally in all directions. It follows that mag-
netic storms are brought about by an influence which arises from
restricted areas of the sun’s surface, and is discharged from such areas
in restricted directions. Thus Mr. Gavin Burns has tabulated his
records of aurorz (Memoirs of the British Astronomical Association,
23, Part I., “ Report of the section for the observation of aurore
and the zodiacal light, 1916-1919”) in recent years in accordance
THE SUN AND SUNSPOTS—MAUNDER 171

with the solar rotation, and the tables show at a glance that the
greatest displays synchronized with the return of certain special
meridians to the center of the sun’s disk; other meridians on the sun
appear to leave our atmosphere quite undisturbed. The sun is struc-
tured, not only as between the northern and southern hemispheres,
and as between different latitudes, but—as regards its emanations—
as between some of its longitudes also.

There are such influences proceeding from the sun, and the outer
corona is built up in obedience to them. This has been clearly seen in
the photographs which have been secured of the corona on many
occasions; as, for example, in the eclipse of December 12, 1871, photo-
graphed at Baikul by Lord Lindsay’s assistant, Mr. Davis, and shown
in the Memoirs of the R. A. S., 41, Plates 7 and 8. The chief feature
of the corona of this eclipse was the massing of its greater portion
into petal-shaped formations, which were called at that time “syn-
clinal groups.” In Plate 7 the synclinal group in the south-southeast
rises above a bright semicircular arc, and much fainter arches can be
discerned rising above the lowest one. Above the highest of these
the sides of the structure curve as if to meet; in Plate 8 they very
nearly meet. Several similar synclinal groups were yet more distinctly
shown.in the photographs obtained by Sir W. H. M. Christie in the
eclipse of 1898 at Sahdol in India, and again in the eclipse of 1901, by
the members of the British expeditions to Sumatra and Mauritius.

But it was in the eclipse of 1898 that the structure of the outermost
corona was photographed; and the synclinal groups, so beautifully
shown on Sir W. H. M. Christie’s negatives, were seen on photographs
taken at Talni, with a Dallmeyer astigmatic lens of 114 inches aper-
ture and 9 inches focus, to terminate in long narrow straight beams,
the apex of the highest arch in each of the groups being, as it were,
blown out, and driven away in a straight line into space. The longest
beam was traced for at least 6,000,000 miles.‘ -

From photographs taken in these and other eclipses, it would ap-
pear that over certain disturbed areas of the solar surface leaf-shaped
structures are built up, from the apices of which matter seems to be
driven away in long straight rod-like beams. Such beams, driven
forth into space and continually replenished from beneath, would, if
in the right direction, from time to time overtake the earth in its orbit,
and strike it on the sunset arc. Remembering that in a hot gaseous
body like the sun, electrified particles, both positively and negatively
charged, must occur in great numbers, we can understand how the
same disturbed area may be fed with particles of different sign, which,
by their mutual attraction, give rise to the rod-like beams that issue
from it. These cross the space that separates the earth from the sun,
and reveal their arrival here by means of magnetic storms and aurore.

Thus it is evident that the disturbed state of the sun’s surface
affects the earth. But there is also some evidence that the earth ap-
pears to affect the sun’s surface. This appears in a slight, but dis-
tinct, dissymmetry between the eastern and western halves of the
apparent disk of the sun, with respect to three orders of solar phe-
nomena: the numbers of prominences; the areas of facule; and the
numbers and areas of spot groups. There is some evidence that the
amount and the sign of this dissymmetry vary in the course of the
solar cycle. A complete explanation is still to seek.®

These conclusions and suggestions have been derived, during the
century of the history of this Society, from observations of the
changes, real and apparent, of the areas of sunspots and of their
distributions in longitude and latitude.

APPENDIX °

In the two years since the writing of the original paper, several
expressions for the rotation period of the sun, varying with the
latitude, have been found for facule and flocculi, phenomena which
differ in character from sunspots and from each other. Comparing
the zones, 5° in breadth, of greatest activity (those with their cen-
ters at 1214° on either side of the Equator) for five of these investi-
gations, we have the following result:

It will be seen that the extreme difference from the mean is only
0.12 of a day.

But these are all mean values for the zone; the scattering shown by
the individual objects in any zone is as marked and significant as
is the crowding round the mean rotation period in that zone. For
example, for spots observed from 6 to 14 days the most active zones
have synodic periods ranging from 2334 to 3090 and facule and floc-
culi both show a scattering of about the same order.

This fact has a bearing on the rotation periods of the sun given
by magnetic storms. It implies that it is not possible to determine
with any degree of certainty the particular zone of solar latitude,
from whence a pair of magnetic storms have arisen, merely by notic-
ing the interval in time that has occurred between them. Thus
Table II gives for 190 pairs of storms occurring between 1848 and
1918, and for spots from 1879 to 1901, the degrees of favor shown
for the various synodic periods.

It is evident that both spots and magnetic storms concentrate
sharply upon a synodic period of 27.1 days.

The representations of the corona, shown in Plates 1-7, are draw-.
ings made from photographs taken by Mrs. Maunder in 1898 in
India, and in 1901 in Mauritius. A drawing of the former was
made by the late Mr. W. H. Wesley; the drawings from the Mauritius
eclipse were made by Miss Beatrice Handler. In the latter it will be
seen that there are two leaflike formations, each covering a very
disturbed are of about 60°. In the complete corona of longer ex-
posure, the apex of each leaf is shown, but while that of the more .
northern is prolonged radially out into a beam, the apex of the more
southern is directed somewhat toward the equator, so that the beam
as a whole is inclined to the normal. In the small-scale photo-
graph, that taken in India in 1898, we see one of the beams pro-
longed into a straight rodlike ray; straight to as great a distance
as it can be distinguished upon the photograph. A recent paper by
Mr. E. A. Milne on “The average life of an excited calcium atom ”
(Monthly Notices, 84, March, 1924) gives some idea of the way
in which such rays arise in the disturbed sun-spot zones and how
their particles escape outward from the sun.
174 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Lately, Doctor Abbot has shown that these rodlike rays, which
are streams of particles, restricted as to the areas from whence they
arise, and in the directions in which they are emitted, affect another
planet of the solar system. In the Proceedings of the National
Academy of Sciences for October, 1923, Doctor Abbot points out
that “when sunspots transit across the central diameter of the
visible disk, lower radiation values occur, and usually reach a
minimum on the day following the transit,” and to explain this,
quotes the observations of Guthnick on the brightness of Saturn,
which indicated certain small fluctuations. These fluctuations
agreed in percentage with the variations of the solar constant, pro-
vided a time allowance was made to take account of the rotation of
the sun from a position facing the earth to one facing Saturn. “It
seemed, in short, as if rays of a certain intensity of radiation, going
out from the sun, rotated along with it, and so affected the dif-
ferent planets in the order of their heliographic longitudes.” He
finds such ragged, unequal rays in the solar corona, and it is evident
that this lower radiation, about a day after a spot transit over the
central meridian, and a magnetic storm are both due—directly or
indirectly—to the same rays, for in the cases of the magnetic storms,
which accompanied the spots 9127 and 9143 (of the Greenwich
series) in February and March, 1920, the lower solar constant in each
case occurred about the time of greatest height of the magnetic storm.
The latter is due to the disturbance of the earth’s magnetism by
the solar ray; the lower solar constant is attributed by Doctor
Abbot, to the diminished transparency of the enveloping ray itself.

We therefore now recognize two distinct methods of radiation
from the sun; the first, general, from the entire surface and in all
directions; the second, special, arising from certain districts in
certain zones, and emitted in restricted directions only.

Indications of variations in the general radiation have been found
by Doctor Abbot by higher values of the solar constant here on
earth, when sunspots form, or are increasing, or are brought by
the solar rotation into view at the east limb of the sun, and when-
ever the solar surface is shown by the Ha spectroheliograms to be
much disturbed. ‘“ When a period of quiescence in solar activity
occurs, the radiation values tend to fall continually until some new
outbreak of activity is observed.” An agreement has also been es-
tablished between the rate of the melting of the white polar caps
of Mars and the progress of the solar cycle. Thus, in 1916
(Monthly Notices, 76, No. 8), E. M. Antoniadi recorded that “ out
of 21 cases of observed melting of the caps between 1862 and 1914,
inclusive, there are four more or less unfavorable and seventeen fa-
vorable to the agreement in question.”

HISTORICAL

There are few if any more fascinating chapters in the history
of science than those dealing with the development of our present
theory of light and the growth of our knowledge gained by careful
experiment upon which any acceptable theory must rest. For cen-
turies there was strife among “ natural philosophers” as to whether
light was due to countless myriads of minute imponderable particles
called corpuscles, shot out along straight lines in every direction
from the source of light, or whether light was an orderly wave
motion spreading out equally and radially in all directions in a
universal imponderable medium called the ether.

Some of the most recent fundamental discoveries in radiation and
‘the newer conceptions of atomic structure and discreet energy
quanta to which these discoveries have given rise have raised new
questions concerning some of the hard and fast details of the estab-
lished wave theory with the likelihood that a partial compromise
between these two age-old hypotheses may sooner or later develop.
Many physicists are already prepared for a wave disturbance theory
of light not quite so harmonious and simply geometric as the
smoothly and evenly spreading wave front nor yet so crudely mate-
rial and projectilelike as the older corpuscular theory. Much more,
however, must be known and done before a new agreement covering
all details can be arrived at.

Historically, Young’s discovery of the interference of two beams
of light, made in the first year of the last century, was a decisive
experiment in favor of a wave theory as opposed to a corpuscular
theory, and it would doubtless promptly have convinced all physi-
cists had it not been for the very great authority of Sir Isaac New-
ton which had come down through more than a century. Newton in
his day had vacillated between a wave theory which had recently
been quite elaborately worked out by the Dutch philosopher Huy-

175
176 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

gens, on the one hand, and the older and more widely favored cor-
puscular theory, on the other. Finally Newton definitely adopted the
corpuscular theory of light, but still thought that heat radiation
might be due to a wave motion. Newton was beyond question one
of the greatest and most progressive thinkers of all time and, had
he been alive, would have been among the first to recognize the con-
vineing evidence of Young’s experiment, but Newton dead proved
a most formidable obstacle to progress.

Young not only proved the wave theory but actually measured
the wave lengths of different colored light and showed a progres-
sive increase in wave length as we go from violet through blue,
green, and yellow to the extreme red. Thus the wave length of
yellow light situated about midway in the orderly spaced band of
colors which we call the normal spectrum is approximately 0.00059
mm. or one fifty-thousandth of an inch. From this time on to
the middle of the nineteenth century, increasing and more convinc-
ing evidence of the wave theory slowly accumulated until Foucault
actually measured the velocity of light in water and found it less
than in air by an amount in exact accordance with the requirements
of the wave theory, while the corpuscular theory required just the
reverse; i. e., a greater velocity in water than in air. Thus a wave
disturbance theory was finally established.

Fifteen years later Maxwell proposed a new theory of the nature
of light waves which he based on Faraday’s experiments. Maxwell’s
theory at the time it was proposed proved as abstruse and baffling .
for physicists of his day as we find Einstein’s generalized theory of
relativity in ours. In fact, Maxwell was the Einstein of his gen-
eration, and he succeeded in puzzling everybody. Maxwell’s theory
asserts that light is an electric wave disturbance in the ether caused
by astoundingly rapid oscillations of minute electric charges in the
source of light. But nobody then knew anything about rapidly oscil-
lating electric charges in light sources, and another outstanding
difficulty in believing that light waves were electric waves was that
nobody had discovered any electric waves with which to compare
them, nor was there any clearly recognized indication that electric
waves were possible.

In the following decade the Berlin Academy of Sciences became
interested in Maxwell’s theory and offered a prize to anyone who
would give experimental proof of its fundamental assumption. Not
long after this prize was offered, von Helmholtz called the attention
of one of his most promising students to it. That student was Hein-
rich Hertz, who later not only obtained electric waves some 2 feet
long in the laboratory but went further and performed a number of
experiments demonstrating that these waves, like light, were reflected

.

ELECTRIC AND HEAT WAVES—NICHOLS AND TEAR 177

from surfaces, bent from their course by prisms, and that they trav-
eled through space with the velocity of light.

Hertz’s successors worked in two different directions. Righi,
the Italian, and a number of other physicists worked toward shorter
and shorter electric waves and repeated with them more and more
of the classical experiments with light. Sir Oliver Lodge, Guglielmo
Marconi, a brilliant young Italian experimenter, Branly, Fleming,
and Braun were inspired by the idea of making electric waves a
means of signaling and communication. These men, working in-
dividually, pushed toward longer and longer waves, because long
electric waves carry farther and are not so easily scattered by
obstacles as short ones. As we know, Marconi won in the contest
of perfecting a practical means of communication without wires,
and from his success we now have radiotelegraphy, and with the
advent of the vacuum tube amplifier we have the greater marvel of
radiotelephony. Thus Hertz worked indefatigably to discover elec-
tric waves in order to prove that Maxwell was right in maintaining
that light waves were electric waves. Hertz’s discovery, with its
consequences, is but one of an accumulating number of instances in
which astoundingly practical results have followed directly from the
most abstruse workings of.the scientific imagination.

Contemporaneously with the discovery and development of elec-
tric waves, great progress was also being made in the investigation
of light and heat waves. Explorers were pushing out into the dark
spectrum below the longest visible red waves. Among the earlier
of these pioneers, and the most brilliant and successful one, was our
illustrious countryman, Prof. S. P. Langley, who began his re-
searches in 1883, using his newly perfected bolometer. He extended
the known spectrum and accurately measured wave lengths down to
5.34, nearly 10 times the length of yellow light waves. By his
researches he not only determined the distribution of energy in the
solar radiation but laid experimental foundations for the develop-
ment of our present general laws of radiation. A decade later a
new method for sifting out and isolating certain long wave radia-
tions from the total output of hot bodies, such as a candle flame or a
Welsbach gas mantle, was discovered by Rubens and Nichols. This
method lead to an extension of our knowledge of long wave lengths
and their measurement to waves more than 25 times the longest
actually measured by Langley. Another twofold extension was ac-
complished by a further advance in method due to Rubens and
Wood, and finally, in 1911, heat waves 0.324 mm., or one seventy-
fifth of an inch, in length, were successfully isolated, measured,
and their properties studied.

There was, however, still an unbridged gulf between the shortest
known electric waves and the longest measured heat waves, for the
178 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

followers of Hertz and Righi had been stopped in their progress
toward short waves about 1 cm., or two-fifths of an inch, in length.

In some experiments still in progress at the Nela Research Labo-
oratory of the National Lamp Works, at Cleveland, the writers, by
devising new and improved instruments and methods of experi-
mentation, have succeeded in generating and working with electric
waves as short as 0.220 mm., or one one-hundredth of an inch—waves
considerably shorter than Ruben’s and von Baeyer’s 0.324 mm., heat
waves.

DESCRIPTION OF SENDING AND RECEIVING APPARATUS

The arrangement of apparatus used in the new experiments is
shown in Plate 1. The Hertzian oscillator or sender is contained in
a brass box, O. The oscillator is a point source, and the diverging
pencil of electric wave radiation emerging from it is formed into
a parallel beam by a lens of paraffin wax. At R,, with a similar
lens in front of it, is a check receiver. Waves emitted by the sender
first fall on the reflecting screen, G, which is usually of ebonite, and
are partially reflected into the check receiver. The remaining por-
tion passes through the screen and falls upon the reflecting echelon
analyzer, a flight of exactly equal brass steps, S. From the face of
the echelon, the beam of electric waves is reflected to the main re-
ceiver, R,. A motor-driven vacuum pump for exhausting the two
receivers is seen in the background. The check receiver, R, , serves
simply as a control on the intensity of the beam emitted by the
oscillator, so that any erratic changes of intensity of the emitted
radiation may be recognized and corrected for.

The oscillator—In a sectional diagram of the oscillator or send-
ing apparatus shown in Figure 1, in which interior parts appear very
much magnified, B is a brass case containing kerosene. T, and T,
are glass tubes in which very small cylinders of tungsten, H, and H,,
are sealed. These tungsten cylinders, separated by a short spark
gap in kerosene, form the Hertzian doublet which emits the short
wave radiation. High potential leads, V, and V., from an induc-
tion coil charge H, and H, by leakage across air gaps, G, and G.,
until H, and H, build up a sufficiently high potential difference to
break down the kerosene insulation in the spark gap, G. The en-
suing electrical oscillations between H, and H, are the source of the
electric waves. Radiation emerging from the oscillator case passes
through the thin circular mica window, W, falls on the paraffin lens,
P, and is formed into a parallel beam. M is a concave metal mirror
behind the doublet to reenforce the issuing beam by reflecting the
backward emission of the oscillator. For simplicity many necessary
details, such as fine adjustments for regulating the spark gap, etc..
ELECTRIC AND HEAT WAVES—NICHOLS AND TEAR 179

are omitted from the diagram. The wave lengths sent out by the
oscillator depend on the length and diameter of the tungsten cylin-
ders, H, and H,. For the shortest waves generated, these cylinders
were 0.1 mm. long by 0.1 mm. diameter (0.004 by 0.004 in.). In
use these small tungsten cylinders are rapidly worn away by the spark.
For single observations, therefore, the oscillator was in most in-
stances operated for periods of less than half a second.

The recewer.—The type of electric wave receiver employed was
a newly designed modification of the Nichols radiometer, which
makes use of the curious temperature effect in rarified gases dis-

TO INDUCTION COIL

Fic. 1.—Schematic sketch of Hertzian oscillator unit

covered 50 years ago by Sir William Crookes. He found that if
a thin plate, warmer on one face than on the other, is mounted
in an inclosure from which the air has been pumped out until only
about 0.0015 part remains, the residual gas exerts a very slight ex-
cess pressure on the warmer side of the plate. To illustrate this
effect, Crookes designed the little radiometers or light mills often
seen revolving in optician’s windows.

To utilize this effect in a very sensitive electric wave receiver, the
instrument shown in the cross-sectional diagram, Figure 2, was con-
structed. A greatly enlarged diagram of the suspended receiver
system is shown at A. D is a very thin whip of drawn glass bear-
ing two similar cross arms, EE. To these are attached two very
180 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

thin, narrow, mica strips, V,, V,. Immediately in front of V,
and directly behind V, are mounted still narrower mica strips, P,
coated with very thin deposits of metallic platinum. When electric
waves fall on metal conductors, they cause very small oscillatory
currents in the surface layer of the metal. Such thin metal coatings
as P possess high electrical resistance. Hence these oscillatory
currents generate minute quantities of heat, which in these experi-

ments raise the temperature of P by amounts roughly of the order of
one-millionth of a degree. The resulting increased gas pressure on
the warmed metal sides of the vanes V, and V, tend to rotate the
system in the direction shown by the arrows. The suspension also
carries a very thin glass silvered mirror, M, by which the amount
of the rotation of the system can be accurately measured. This
suspension complete weighing usually less than 1 mg. (about one-
thirty thousandth part of the weight of a 2-cent letter) is hung on a
very fine fiber of spun quartz, F, from a central stem in the double-

waves which rotate the suspension are opposed by the resulting twist
of the quartz fiber F. The angle of twist of the fiber under proper
conditions is found to be proportional to the intensity of the electric
wave radiation, and thus quantitative measurements of wave in-
tensity are easily made.

Wave-length measurements.—Wave-length measurements of the
radiation received from the electric oscillator were made with two
types of analyzers. The first, shown in Plate 2, Figure 1, is the in-
terferometer, due to Boltzmann, consisting of two parallel mirrors,
M, and M,, of which M, can be displaced backward or forward with-

1454—25——-13
182 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

out rotation. When M, is slightly behind M,, as shown, a wave train
reflected from the upper mirror has a longer path to follow from
sender to receiver than the other half of the same train reflected by
the lower mirror. It is thus delayed, and when the two halves of the
beam are reunited at the receiver, the separated wave trains may no
longer match. By varying the distance by which the plane of the
mirror M, is behind that of the mirror M,, wave crests in one beam
can be made to fall on the earlier wave crests of the other, and thus

Fig. 4.—Sketch illustrating the formation of a relatively long wave train from a short
electromagnetic pulse

the two beams reenforce each other. On the other hand, wave crests
of one can be brought together with the wave troughs of the other,
and the two made to weaken each other. Observed positions of the
mirror M, for reenforcements and neutralizations thus give a direct
means for measuring the wave length of the radiation.

When oscillator and receiver are strictly in tune, interference
curves like those shown in Figure 8 are obtained. In these wave
diagrams, vertical distances from 0 to 100 represent radiant inten-
sities as shown by the receiver. Horizontal distances to the right
ELECTRIC AND HEAT WAVES—-NICHOLS AND TEAR 183

indicate differences in the length of path of the two beams reflected
by the two mirrors M,,M,. This path difference equals twice the dis:
placement of the movable mirror.

A more complete knowledge of the form of wave trains sent out
by the oscillator is obtained by the newly designed reflecting echelon
analyzer shown in Plate 2, Figure 2. This instrument is in the
form of a staircase made of 10 exactly equal brass blocks, the lower
back edges of which rest against a slanting plate of glass. The
tilt of this glass plate and consequently the width of tread of the
steps can be controlled and measured by the micrometer screw seen
at the top of the apparatus. The way a single wave from the oscil-
lator is divided up after reflection from the rises of the steps is
shown diagrammatically in Figure 4, B. A shows the outline of
the steps and C is the wave form obtained when the short individual
wave trains are brought together again at the receiver. By vary-
ing the width of the steps, this instrument gives a complete analysis
of the wave trains, showing both wave length and form.

The simplicity of the principles involved in these experiments
and the homely character of the apparatus used may easily conceal
the almost vanishing smallness of the quantities measured and the
great experimental difficulties which had to be overcome.

The extended electric wave spectrum.—With the instruments and .
methods indicated we have not only artificially manufactured and
measured electric waves 220y (one one-hundredth inch) long but
have used our electric wave receiver in two different forms to detect
and remeasure the 324 (one seventy-fifth inch) heat waves obtained
from hot bodies. Thus, for the first time, waves from hot bodies
and artificially generated electric waves of the same length have
been obtained, compared, and found identical in character. These
experiments thus supply the last link in a long chain of experi-
mental evidence connecting light with electric waves and furnish
a final proof of Maxwell’s electromagnetic theory of light.

That not only radiation emitted by highly heated bodies, including
infra-red, visible, and ultra-violet rays are electric waves, but so also
are X ray and gamma rays from radium, can no longer be questioned.
Thus the true electric wave spectrum is expanded by an enormous
extent, for a 20,000-meter radio wave is over 20,000,000 billion times
as long as a short gamma or X ray.

Of many things thus brought to notice, nothing is more surpris-
ing than the very narrow limitations of the eye in perceiving electric
waves as light. Our entire range of vision from the farthest violet
to the deepest red is only from a wave length of about 0.39 to
0.78u. It is not possible to show such small detail and such vast,

reaches out to the longer electric waves which extend to long radio
waves which lie at a distance on our scale of a 100,000 miles to the
right—surely an unwieldly chart!

A more convenient and adequate method of charting the whole
sweep of this comprehensive spectrum is by using geometric inter-
vals such as the ascending powers of 2 used in laying off a piano
keyboard, on which the wave length of two notes an octave apart are
to each other as 2 to 1. Such a spectrum chart is shown in Figure
5. On the left are the usual names given to the division of the
spectrum. These names are historical in character and belong to
the time when the identity of the spectrum as a whole was not
realized. To these historic divisions, braces are attached to show
approximately their extent on the black strip representing the
spectrum. Beyond is shown the number of octaves embraced in
each division, and farthest to the right the wave lengths roughly
corresponding to these regional boundaries. Of the 53 octaves of
the spectrum shown in Figure 8, only 1 octave contains wave lengths
visible to the eye, and there is but one remaining region of 3.3
octaves between the ultra-violet and X ray spectra in which actual
wave-length measurements have not been made. Waves lying in this
interval and also radiations beyond the shortest measured X rays and
gamma rays indicated have been observed, and the recently dis-
covered “quantum” relationships give a sound theoretical basis for
calculating these wave lengths, but no interference or diffraction
measurements have thus far been carried out in these limited regions.

Matter under the action of heat is capable of giving off radiations
in the so-called infra-red, visible, and ultra-violet spectra; gamma
rays are the natural accompaniment of radioactive transformations,
and there are various static electric phenomena in the atmosphere
which give rise to disturbances resembling fragments of very long
electric waves, but X rays and the old and new short electric waves
we may still regard as artificial or purely products of laboratory
manufacture.

TITE POSSIBILITIES OF INSTRUMENTAL DEVELOP-
MENT?

By Grorcre H. HALe

Nothing is more encouraging to the scientific investigator than the
rapid multiplication in recent years of the possibilities of in-
strumental development. In astronomy the opportunities for ad-
vance have been vastly enlarged by the remarkable progress of
physics and chemistry, and the many new instruments and methods
thus rendered available. To appreciate our advantages, we have
only to glance rapidly over the history of science and contrast present
possibilities with those of the past.

The beginning of the new year, practically coinciding with the
annual inundation of the Nile, was fixed by observations of the helia-
cal rising of Sirius before 4000 B.C. Throughout their entire history
the Egyptian priests were astronomers, yet their sundials, water
clocks, and the crude “ Merkhet,” a measuring instrument for de-
termining the time from observations of stars near the meridian,
apparently underwent no important improvement down to the Greek
occupation of Egypt. The Babylonians, although much more ef-
fective observers than the Egyptians, have left us no instruments,
unless the “ astrolabe ” found in the palace of Assurbanipal may be
thus classed. The Greeks invented several instruments, which are
described by Ptolemy in the Almagest. Most of these consist es-
sentially of a graduated arc of a circle, provided with adjustable
sights and supported in the plane of observation. So completely did
these instruments embody the ingenuity of the Greeks that they were
adopted without important change by the Arabs, Hindus, and
Chinese, and served for the equipment of Tycho Brahe’s great obsery-
atory in the period of revival of the sixteenth century. Tycho de-
voted special attention to the improvement of instruments, which
he constructed in his own shops. But though spectacles had been
worn since the end of the thirteenth century, he little suspected the
great opportunity they placed within his grasp.

The history of lenses is full of interest. It is very improbable that
the disk of rock crystal, oval in shape and roughly ground to a plano-

187
188 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

convex form, which was found by Layard in Sargon’s palace at Nim-
roud, was actually intended for use as a lens, in spite of Sir David
Brewster’s contrary opinion. Nor canitbe safely affirmed from their
minuteness of detail and perfection of execution that the finely en-
graved gems of antiquity were cut under lenses. Pliny the elder
and others state that globes filled with water were used as burning
glasses, and Seneca remarks that “letters though small and in-
distinct are seen enlarged and more distinct through a globe of glass
filled with water.” Yet while defects of vision were frequently dis-
cussed by many classic authors, they made no reference to the
simplest optical aids, and myopia was repeatedly declared to be in-
curable down to the end of the thirteenth century, when spectacles
first came into use.

Roger Bacon and his teacher, Grossteste, undoubtedly understood
some of the properties of lenses and concave mirrors, but the evidence
advanced to support the opinion that Bacon used telescopes for astro-
nomical observations is not convincing. The early history of the
telescope remains rather obscure, but from our point of view the
most important fact is its application in astronomy by Galileo and
the revolution in human thought effected by his discoveries. His
sudden recognition and utilization of a principle which had certainly
been applied in the case of spectacles for 300 years quickly trans-
formed the equipment of the observatory and laid the foundation of
astrophysical research. In 1630 Francesco Generini saw the feasibil-
ity of using the telescope for increased precision in pointing, pre-
sumably by introducing threads into the focal plane of the eyepiece.
About 10 years later the inventor of the micrometer undoubtedly
used this method. The modern period of astronomical measure-
ment was thus begun.

As for the telescope itself, it was first improved by the invention
of the Keplerian eyepiece and then increased in focal length to over-
come the troublesome effects of aberration. Rayleigh has shown that
a single lens of 1.7-inch aperture is as good as an achromatic when
its focus is 66 feet. Huygens, who worked out the theory of aber-
ration, consequently greatly increased the aperture and focal length
of his telescopes. He also devised the Huygenian eyepiece and was
rewarded for his efforts by the discovery of the true nature of the
rings of Saturn. Three of his objectives, with focal lengths of 122,
170, and 210 feet, respectively, are still in the possession of the Royal
Society. Telescopes up to 600 feet in length were made in this
period, but the difficulty of finding and following the celestial object
seriously affected their value. Obviously, they could not be carried
on equatorial mountings, first described for telescopic purposes in
Scheiner’s Rosa Ursina, but really not different in principle from
the equatorial armilla of Tycho Brahe. An accessory of the highest
INSTRUMENTAL DEVELOPMENT—HALE 189

importance developed at this time was the pendulum clock, devised
by Huygens following Galileo’s discovery of isochronism.

Two steps taken for the purpose of overcoming chromatic aberra-
tion ultimately proved successful. The reflecting telescope, intro-
duced by Gregory and Newton, reached apertures of 4 feet in the
hands of Herschel and 6 feet in those of Lord Rosse. The invention
of the achromatic objective, followed by the production of optical
glass in larger and larger disks, made way for the great refractors
of the present day. Their high perfection, like that of the modern
reflector, is the result of successive advances in the art of the glass
maker, the metallurgist, the mechanical engineer, and the optician,
and the development of modern machine tools, which Lord Rosse
did not possess. Even if the photographic plate had then been per-
fected, the absence of an accurately driven equatorial mounting
would have rendered it useless with his 6-foot reflector. The refine-
ment and precision of the modern meridian circle, with its nearly
perfect pivots and beautifully graduated circles, is another result of
the improved art of the instrument maker, which is also illustrated
in such valuable accessories as the latest types of clocks, the record-
ing chronograph, and the moving wire micrometer.

The first telescopes collected about 80 times as much light as the
unaided eye, and this light-gathering power has now been increased
to about 200,000 times that of the eye. As the quality of the atmos-
phere and the optical and mechanical perfection of the best modern
instruments are sufficiently good to permit all of this light (barring
losses by reflection) to be concentrated and held in a very small
image, the gain thus effected is enormous. But the advantages de-
rived from the introduction and improvement of the photographic
plate, and the development of many auxiliary instruments and
methods, are still more important.

When Newton decomposed sunlight with a prism in 1672, he took
the first great step in the initiation of spectroscopy. It was not until
1803, however, that Wollaston, using a narrow slit instead of New-
ton’s wider one, detected the principal dark lines in the solar spec-
trum, nearly 600 of which were measured by Fraunhofer in 1814.
Their interpretation by Stokes, who, in 1852, recognized that the
double D line is due to sodium vapor, which absorbs the same radia-
tions that it emits, and later by Kirchhoff and Bunsen, who, in 1859,
identified many terrestrial elements in the sun, provided the means
of determining the chemical composition of celestial objects.

The study of stellar evolution, foreshadowed by Herschel and by
Laplace in the nebular hypothesis, was thus rendered possible in the
very year of the publication of Darwin’s Origin of Species.
This was a tremendous advance, even when only the classification
of stellar spectra, at once undertaken by Secchi and Huggins, and

1454—25——_14
190 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

the apparent variation of chemical composition with stellar evolu-
tional progress, are considered. But the chief significance of the
adoption of the spectroscope in the observatory lies in the extraord-
inary versatility of this instrument, and the possibilities it affords
of utilizing in astronomy the widest variety of physical and chemi-
cal discoveries.

In 1842 Doppler tried to prove that the color of a star depends
upon its velocity. If a star radiated monochromatic light and its
velocity were great enough, his conclusion would be correct. Rightly
applied with the spectroscope, his principle has given us the means
of measuring the motions of gases in the solar atmosphere; the rota-
tion of the sun, planets, and nebule; the orbital velocity of close
double stars discoverable only by this method; and the velocity in
the line of sight of various celestial objects.

I wish that time permitted me to dwell on the extraordinary har-
vest which has resulted from the skillful application of this and
other principles of physics, but I can only recall a few of them.
The shift toward red or violet of spectral lines by pressure affords
a means of measuring the pressure in stellar atmospheres, after
other effects have been allowed for. The variation of the relative
intensities of lines with temperature gives one clue to stellar tem-
peratures, and has also led indirectly to Adams’ beautiful method of
deriving absolute magnitudes and parallaxes from stellar spectra.
Reduced to a sound scientific basis through the recent advances of
physics, the study of line intensities has also become one of our most
powerful guides, not only to the nature of stars but to the structure
of the atom itself. The shift of the maximum of intensity in the
spectrum as a function of the temperature, the influence of magnetic
and electric fields on radiation, the phenomena of polarization, of
anomalous dispersion, and of optical resonance are also among the
numerous discoveries of the physicist which the astronomer has al-
ready utilized, with important positive or negative results.

In addition to the spectroscope, the astronomer has derived from
the physical laboratory a long line of other valuable instruments.
The photometer, now powerfully supplemented and largely dis-
placed by photographic methods, has given us the magnitudes of tens
of thousands of stars. The thermopile, bolometer, and radiometer
have led to remarkable advances in our knowledge of the infra-red
spectrum, the precise measurement of the varying intensity of the
solar radiation, the determination of the heat radiation of stars as
faint as the thirteenth magnitude, and even to studies of the energy
spectra of some of the brighter stars: The photo-electric cell has
yielded stellar photometric measures of surprising precision. The
radiometer, which gave the first actual measure of the pressure of
radiation, now known to play such a dominant part in the massive
INSTRUMENTAL DEVELOPMENT—HALE 191

stars, has recently provided the means of detecting the last wave
lengths missing in the long range from the gamma rays of radium to
radio waves 20,000 meters in length. The interferometer, springing
from Young’s famous interference experiment of more than a century
ago, has served for scores of brilliant successes, recently culminating
in the determination of the angular diameters of giant stars.

Without attempting to enumerate more of the astronomer’s long
list of debts to the physicist and chemist, let us look for a moment at
the increase in the precision of measurement effected by instrumental
advances. The star places of the Greek were given to the nearest 10’
of arc, one-third the diameter of the moon. Tycho succeeded in
reducing the probable error of a single measure of the distance be-
tween two neighboring stars to 57’’.. In double star observations the
probable errors of the best micrometric measures are about 0’’.1._ In
modern photographic parallax determinations the probable error is
about 0’’.005 to 0’’.010. With the interferometer, the probable error
of a single measure of the separation of the components of Capella
is 0’’.001. The diameter of Arcturus, 0’’.019, can be similarly meas-
ured with a probable error of about the same amount.

The advantages to be gained by the early utilization of the rapid
progress of the physicist and chemist are obvious. Almost any dis-
covery may help us directly or indirectly. We are interested in new
organic dyes because they may improve the sensitiveness of our plates
in various regions, especially in the infra-red, a most promising field
for future research. We earnestly hope for a reduction in the size of
the grain of the most rapid photographic plates, which would be
equivalent to a marked increase in the aperture of our telescopes. We
keenly watch for the appearance of new alloys, perhaps suitable for
telescope mirrors or for the special needs of optical gratings; pro-
gress in the manufacture of optical glass; the production of large
masses of clear fused quartz for prisms or mirrors—every technical
advance, in fact, that we can learn to utilize. And we are equally
anxious to benefit by the constant improvement of high-tension trans-
formers, electric furnaces, vacuum tubes, electromagnets, and the
many other devices on which we depend for the imitation and inter-
pretation of celestial phenomena.

These illustrations of the increasing possibilities of instrumental
development have not been enumerated in strict chronological se-
quence, but a glance at this partial list will show how rapidly the
opportunities of the astronomer have multiplied in recent years.
Another point should be noted: The obvious chance is not always
the most important one, and the greatest advances may come from the
recognition of possibilities that are not immediately apparent.
Hence the astronomer can not watch too intently the progress of re-
lated sciences, and especially the numerous devices and methods
192 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

which are constantly arising in various fields. Such beautiful new
instruments as the X-ray spectrograph or the mass spectrograph of
Aston, while perhaps not directly applicable in astronomy, may con-
tain hints, and also yield results, which can be used to advantage.

The above considerations will help to explain the somewhat un-
orthodox equipment and policy of the Mount Wilson Observatory.
We have tried from the outset, with the valuable cooperation of our
research associates, to at least utilize the more obvious possibilities
offered by the progress of physics and chemistry, and to gain such
advantages as laboratory conditions and methods placed at our dis-
posal. Hence the design of the Snow and tower telescopes, equipped
for solar research; the coudé principle and constant temperature
laboratories of the 60-inch and 100-inch reflectorss arranged for the
photography of stellar spectra under high dispersion, and for in-
vestigations like those with the thermopile, bolometer, and radio-
meter on stellar radiation and energy spectra; the exceptional care
taken to secure smooth rotation of the 100-inch dome in order to
diminish the vibration of the high dispersion stellar spectograph
(soon to be mounted on its pier) during exposures continued for
several nights; the construction of the ruling machine, one of the
prime purposes of which is to permit such experiments as have just
rendered possible the concentration of most of the incident light in
any desired order of spectrum; the development of the stellar inter-
ferometer, first in conjunction with the 100-inch telescope and now
as a separate instrument. Hence the provision of machine and
optical shops adequate for a wide range of constructional work and
a physical laboratory in which to conduct researches required for the
interpretation of celestial phenomena. Hence also our close coopera-
tion with the California Institute of Technology, the recent growth
of which as a research institution is so advantageous to the observa-
tory.

Looking ahead, and speculating on the possibilities of future in-
struments, it may be mentioned that comparative tests of the 60-inch
and 100-inch telescopes promise well for larger apertures. Their
practicability, so far as this depends upon atmospheric limitations,
can be fairly well tested by observations of the united star images
given by the two mirrors of a stellar interferometer at increasing
separations. The production of large mirror disks is another prob-
lem. Fused quartz mirrors, if they can be made of sufficient dimen-
sions, will be extremely valuable for solar telescopes and large re-
flectors because of their low coefficient of expansion, but for moderate
apertures pyrex glass has already proved a fairly effective substi-
tute. As for the stellar interferometer, I believe it will ultimately
attain apertures of 100 feet or more, possibly in some fixed form,
INSTRUMENTAL DEVELOPMENT—HALE 193

with accurately controlled coelostats. Fixed telescopes and spectro-
graphs for solar work, whether horizontal or vertical, can be short-
ened if desirable by the use of telephoto lenses or by combinations
of mirrors. Both the ultra-violet and the less refrangible part of
solar and stellar spectra deserve more consideration than they have
received, and here especially improvements in the photographic
process, as well as in prisms and reflecting surfaces for the ultra-
violet, are greatly to be desired. No increase in the resolving power
of the grating is required for astronomical purposes, but more light,
obtainable from greater area of ruled surface, with concentration in
a single order, is- still needed for various researches.

I shall not attempt in this paper to deal with less obvious possi-
bilities, or to discuss particular problems. Let me conclude with
the reminder that if instruments are important, “the man at the
eye end ” is more important by far. In the Hindu treatise Siddhanta
Siromani, the astronomer Bhaskara, after describing a new form of
instrument, exclaims: “ But what does a man of genius want with
instruments, about which numerous works have treated? Let him
only take a staff in his hand and look at any object along it,
casting his eye from its end to the top, there is:nothing of which
he will not then tell its altitude, dimensions, etc.” If we can not
afford the sacrifice of precision which is here so lightly recommended,
we may at least remember that the mathematician embodies in him-
self the most powerful of all instruments for the solution of celestial
problems, and we may also find encouragement in the simple means
that have served in many classical researches. When Young laid the
foundations of the wave theory of light, and discovered the principle
of the interferometer, his*instruments were limited to a small mir-
ror, a few bits of paper and cardboard, some fine hairs, and a couple
of knife blades. If we are not mathematicians or experimental
physicists, and do not share in the use of large telescopes, we may
still find ample encouragement in the history of astronomical
progress. We have only to recall the splendid results obtained by
systematic observation with small telescopes by such men as Burn-
ham, Barnard, and Carrington, or those derived, also with small in-
struments, by men like Huggins, Secchi, and the pioneers in astro-
nomical photography, from the prompt and intelligent application of
methods and devices borrowed from the laboratory.

THE BORDERLAND OF ASTRONOMY AND GEOLOGY?

By Prof. A. S. EpprneTon, F.R.S8.

The region in which geology and astronomy most conspicuously
overlap is in the theories of the origin of our planet. We have, in
fact, two main theories—one due originally to an astronomer, La-
place, and the other to a geologist, Chamberlin.

In the last century the evolution of a star seems often to have
been regarded as something quite detached from the evolution of
the stellar universe. Just as the birth and death of a man is an
incident which can occur at any time in the rise and decline of
the human race, so it was thought that the birth and extinction of
a particular star formed merely a detached incident in the course
of progress of the stellar universe—if, indeed, the universe was
progressing in any particular direction. Thus it was a natural be-
lief that the stars died out and were re-formed by collisions of ex-
tinct stars; and that the matter which now forms the sun had
undergone many alternations of incandescence and extinction since
things first began. But this view is quite at variance with the
general tendency of sidereal astronomy in the present century. We
have come to recognize that the stellar system is one great organiza-
tion, and that the stars which are shining now are more or less
coeval with one another. Everyone would admit that Mars and
Jupiter were formed as parts of one process of evolution—not nec-
essarily at the same moment, but each formed as the process reached
the appropriate stage; and similarly we now believe that it was
one process of evolution sweeping across the primordial matter
which caused it to form itself into stars; and these original stars
are the actual stars which we see shining now. No doubt the
evolution did not develop at the same rate in all parts of the
universe, and there are probably places where stars are still being
formed; but you will see that this view is entirely different from
the other view that stars were being formed individually by hap-
hazard collisions of dark stars, so that each was an independent
formation, having no time connection with other stars.

This view has been forced on us partly by direct evidence of
organization among the stars, pointing to a common origin for
large groups of stars. We notice scattered groups such as the
Hyades, which have almost exactly equal and parallel motions.

Clearly it would be impossible to form such a group if each star
were the product of an accidental collision. The only way in which
a common motion like this can arise is by associated development
from some nebula or other diffuse distribution of matter. The
connection is clearly a connection of common origin. Again, prac-
tically all the bright stars of Orion form a similar group, having
common motion; and, moreover, they have all reached a similar
stage of evolution. They are connected with the great Orion nebula,
the faint extensions of which fill up nearly the whole constellation.
It is obvious that here we have to deal with a single evolutionary
development. But another point which militates against a collision
theory is the extreme rarity of collisions and close approaches. The
distances separating the stars are enormous compared with their
own dimensions. Sir Frank Dyson once used the illustration of
20 tennis balls, distributed at random throughout the whole interior
of the earth, to give a model of the density of distribution of the
stars. It has sometimes been objected that we do not know how
many extinct stars may be wandering about and colliding. Dyson’s
20 tennis balls represent only the dwminous stars; there may, for
all we know, be millions of dark bodies ready to be fired into in-
candescence by collision. I think, however, that there is now good
evidence, based on the dynamics of stellar motions, that the dark
stars can not greatly outnumber the luminous stars—probably not
ten times and certainly not a hundred times. (If they were more
numerous than that, the average velocities of stars would, owing
to the gravitational attraction, be much higher than is observed.)
That argument, then, is no longer valid. Taking a very liberal view
of the kind of approach that can be held to constitute a collision it is
estimated that a star would only suffer collision once in 10** years.

Thus the astronomer is not predisposed to look favorably on a
hypothesis of the origin of the solar system which postulates any-
thing of the nature of a collision. He has the conception of an
orderly development of the stars crystallizing out of the primordial
material, and, unless perhaps in exceptional cases, following an
undisturbed course of development. We hope for a theory that
will show us the star after its first isolation from surrounding
material spontaneously developing the system of planets.

It now appears almost certain that, whether the original matter
was gaseous or whether it was composed of meteors, it must at
an early stage in the star’s history have been completely volatilized
into gas. This was while the star was extremely diffuse, and, for
example, before the planets separated from it. This means that
the material now forming a planet has at one time passed through
the furnace, and has cooled down from a gaseous stage. How far
ASTRONOMY AND GEOLOGY——-EDDINGTON 197

that has a direct bearing on geology I can not say, since I have
nothing to guide me as to the course of its subsequent checkered
history. I do not say that the earth was a gaseous body when it first
became recognizable as an independent planet, but I am convinced that
its material was at one time merged in a completely gaseous sun.

It may be of interest to indicate why it seems so probable that
a star in its early diffuse state is gaseous and not meteoric. The
stars are known to be of closely similar mass. There are occasional
exceptions, but probably 90 per cent of them are between one-half
and five times the sun’s mass. We have no explanation of this
uniformity if they are initially merely aggregations of solid meteors;
but we have a very exact explanation if they are gaseous. In
fact this critical mass round which the actual masses of the stars
cluster so closely is predicted by the theory of equilibrium of
spheres of gas, using only well-known physical constants deter-
mined in the laboratory. The crucial factor is radiation pressure,
which is inappreciable in smaller masses, and almost suddenly
takes control between one-half and five times the sun’s mass. There
can be little doubt that large radiation pressure, tending to overcome
gravity, conduces to instability, so that larger masses have small
chance of survival. Somewhere about one-half the sun’s mass the
radiation pressure no longer counts seriously, so that there is no
tendency for the primitive material to break into smaller units.

The existence of radioactive minerals on the earth seems to supply
another reason for believing that its material was originally sub-
jected to high temperature or to physical conditions of a different
order from those now prevailing. In radioactivity we see a mecha-
nism running down which must at some time have been wound up.
Without entering into any details, it would seem clear that the
winding-up process must have occurred under physical conditions
vastly different from those in which we now observe only a running
down. The only possible guess seems to be that the winding-
up is part of the general brewing of material which occurs under
the intense heat in the interior of the stars.

The trend of this argument has been against the Chamberlin-
Moulton hypothesis, and in favor of some form.of nebular orgin
of the solar system. It is, of course, accepted that the details of
the original nebular hypothesis of Laplace require modification.
Also the word nebula is meant to signify diffuse gaseous materiai
in general, and has no immediate connection with those objects
which we see in the sky, and call nebule more particularly. There
is still controversy as to what process of evolution is represented by
the spiral nebule which are seen in such numbers—what they will
ultimately turn into; but the controversy is whether the spiral
198 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

nebula will give rise to a cluster of a few hundred stars, or whether
it will turn into a stellar universe on the same scale as the great
system of some thousands of millions of stars which forms our
galactic system. There is now no suggestion that it has anything
to do with the formation of so insignificant a system as the solar
system. But in preferring the nebular hypothesis to that of Cham-
berlin and Moulton, it is necessary to make a certain reservation.
We have hitherto taken it for granted that the formation of a sys-
tem of planets is a normal feature of the evolution of a star. Most
of my arguments have referred to the development of stars in gen-
eral, and would become irrelevant if it could be admitted that the solar
system were an exceptional formation violating ordinary expectation.

We know that at least a third of the stars are double stars, and
I do not think there is any reason to think that planetary systems
would be formed when the evolution takes that course; but until
recently it was taken for granted that the remaining single stars
would generally (or at least frequently) be the rulers of systems
of planets. Jeans has recently pitched a bombshell into the camp,
suggesting that the solar system is a freak system—the result of a
rare accident, which could only happen to one star out of a very
large number. He found no way of accounting for it as a normal
process. I have not the specialist knowledge necessary to criticize
the details of the working of the nebular or of the planetismal theory
of development, but before regarding Jeans’ argument as conclusive
(he himself makes reservations) I should be more satisfied if the
effect of radiation pressure had been taken into account. It is fairly
clear that radiation pressure plays a great part in the separation of
nebulous matter into stars, and although I have no definite reason
to think that it can account for the separation of planets from the
sun, I do not feel satisfied that we have got at the whole truth until
that point has been duly examined.

Supposing, however, that we are forced to accept Jeans’ sugges-
tion that the solar system is a freak system, some of my objections
to the Chamberlin-Moulton hypothesis are removed. I can not ad-
mit that the conditions of collision which that hypothesis requires
are normal features in the formation of stars; but they might have
happened occasionally in the history of the universe, and produced
the solar system, the sun being thus an exceptional star born out
of due time. But if my arguments against Chamberlin’s hypothesis
fall to the ground, there are probably other astronomers prepared
to attack it in other directions.

The new views as to the age of the earth are now pretty well
known to geologists. I may sum them up briefly in the statement
that Lord Kelvin’s estimate of the extent of geological time need not
now be taken any more seriously than Archbishop Ussher’s, and
ASTRONOMY AND GEOLOGY—-EDDINGTON 199

that the geologist may claim anything up to 10,000 million years
without provoking a murmur from astronomers. Although there
may still be some difficulties about the exact source from which the
vast heat energy the stars pour out into space is derived, it is now
clear that the Helmholtz contraction theory is inadequate to give the
necessary supply. The astronomer has no such precise means of
measuring geological time as the physicist has now discovered by the
analysis of radioactive minerals; but he can add his contributory
evidence that the sun, and presumably therefore the earth, is much
older than Lord Kelvin allowed: In the Cepheid variable stars it
seems possible to measure the actual rate at which evolution is pro-
ceeding—the rate at which the star is condensing from a diffysed
state to a denser state. The star is believed to be pulsating, and as
it expands and contracts the light varies in quantity and character.
In a pulsating gravitating mass the period is proportional to the in-
verse square root of the density, so that by observing the rate at
which the period is changing we can deduce the rate at which the
density is changing. I may add that the law that the period depends
on the inverse square root of the density is very closely confirmed by
comparing the values for the various Cepheids. In this way we
find that for the best observed of these stars, 8 Cephei, the density is
changing 500 times slower than the contraction hypothesis assumes.
It would, of course, be risky to assume that the same proportion
holds at all stages of the evolution of a star; but it suggests that
Lord Kelvin’s estimate of 20 million years for the age of the sun
might well be multiplied by 500 to give 10,000 million years. At
any rate, the Cepheid observations show that the stars must have
some other source of energy besides contraction.

I suppose it must be a matter of interest to geologists whether the
intensity of the sun’s heat has been constant or whether it was at one
time hotter than now. I think we can say fairly definitely that the
sun was formerly much hotter.2. There must have been a time when
the sun’s heat was from 20 to 50 times more intense than it is now.
That would no doubt have made a great difference to many geolog-
ical processes. Unfortunately, I can not say whether it occurred in
known geological epochs. It must have occurred after the earth
had begun to exist as a separate planet; but whether it was before or
after the sequence of geological strata began to be laid down I have no
idea. It would not be unreasonable, however, to expect that in the early
geological times the sun was several times hotter than it is at present.

After the evolution of the solar system, we naturally turn to con-
sider the evolution of the earth-moon system. My impression is that

2 New facts have emerged since this was written. I think we can now say “fairly defi-

nitely ’”’ that the sun’s heat has not altered appreciably during the last 10,000 million
years. (November, 1924.)
200 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

nothing in recent progress suggests any doubt that the beautiful
theory of Sir George Darwin is substantially correct. The main
features are that the moon at one time formed part of the earth, and
broke away. At that time the rotation period of the earth was be-
tween 3 and 4 hours, and the cause of the fracture was that the solar
tidal force synchronized with a free period of natural vibration of
the earth; owing to resonance the tidal deformation of the earth
continually increased until rupture occurred. The earth’s period of
rotation has since lengthened to 24 hours, owing to frictional dissi-
pation of energy by lunar and solar tides; and the back reaction of the
lunar tides on the moon has caused the moon to recede to its present
considerable distance. All this has well stood the test of searching criti-
cism, and must be considered as extremely probable. Modern research
has added two contributions; it enables us to calculate the magnitude
of this tidal friction at the present time, and it enables us to locate
more exactly the region where the frictional dissipation is occurring.

I believe it was Darwin’s view that the tides most potent in wast-
ing energy were not water tides but tides in the solid earth; that is
to say, we have to do with deformations of the whole earth under
the tide-raising force of the moon’s attraction. Undoubtedly these
deformations of the earth occur, but everything turns on whether
the process of deformation is attended with serious friction. H.
Jefireys has pointed out that the phenomenon of latitude variation
is accompanied by similar deformations of the earth; and in this case
it is clear that the friction is inconsiderable, for otherwise the devia-
tions of the pole from the symmetrical position would be damped
out almost at once. It seems, therefore, very unlikely that the solid
tides can have had much effect in the process of tidal evolution of
the earth-moon system. Ocean tides are likewise of small effect, as
Darwin himself had seen. The modern conclusion is a very curious
one; it is in the landlocked shallow seas that nearly all the mischief
occurs. This was discovered by G. I. Taylor, who found that the
Trish Sea alone is responsible for one-fiftieth of the whole amount
required by observation. The remaining landlocked basins on the
earth are probably capable of making up the necessary total.

The actual rate at which the earth’s rotation is being slowed down
at the present era can probably be deduced with fair accuracy from
the records of ancient eclipses. The day is lengthening about one-
thousandth of a second per century or 1 minute in 6,000,000 years.
At this rate we should have to go back more than 10,000 million years
to the time when the day was between 3 and 4 hours and the moon was
born. Since the rate depends on the accidental circumstance of occur-
ence of shallow seas, no definite prediction can be made; but allowing
for the much greater effect of the tides when the moon was nearer to
us, it is difficult to date the birth later than 1,000 million years ago.
ASTRONOMY AND GEOLOGY——-EDDINGTON 201

Had the earth a solid crust at the time the catalysm happened?
I cannot tell at all. But, if it suits geological theories, I can see |
no objection whatever to the hypothesis that the earth had a solid
crust at the time. No cohesion of the crust would seriously resist
the enormous forces involved when the resonant vibration got
started. It would not be appreciably more difficult than the dis-
ruption of a molten earth. The view that the Pacific Ocean is the
hollow left at the place where the moon broke off seems tenable
unless geologists find objection to it; and in that case we may sup-
pose that the water now collected in the hollow formerly covered
the earth—or most of it. This change of condition of the earth may
(or may not) have happened within geological times. When the
earth was covered with water there would be no landlocked seas
and no appreciable tidal friction from the sun (the moon being not
yet born), so that we can allow a long previous history during which
the length of day was nearly constant at 3 or 4 hours. That rather
helps to make the whole theory self-consistent.

These speculations stand very much as they did when Darwin put
forward his theory. But I am tempted to add further speculations
arising out of the location of the frictional dissipation. (I am
taking advantage of the great opportunity for speculation which
this address affords. Ordinarily I am restrained, because people
would ask, What facts can you produce in support of your specula-
tions? But here I am asking the question, Have you any facts
which seem to support them? If not, by all means let them drop.)
The frictional dissipation acts as a brake on the earth’s rotation,
and we now feel confident that the brake is a surface brake applied
at certain points on the earth’s surface where the favorable condi-
tions exist. The retarding force is transmitted to the earth’s in-
terior, and so delays the rotation as a whole; but unless the material
is entirely nonplastic there will be a tendency for the outer layers
to slip on the inner layers. I do not know how much the material
a few hundred miles below the surface would be expected to give
under the strain; it may be inappreciable, but I will assume that
though small it has some effect.

We have then the whole crust slipping from east to west over the
main part of the interior. Probably it would go very stickily, some-
times arrested by a jamming which would hinder it for a time and
then going on more easily. That is helpful in explaining certain
astronomical observations. There are irregularities in the motions
of heavenly bodies, noticed particularly in the swift moving moon,
but shown also on a smaHler scale in the sun and planets, which
appear to indicate that our standard timekeeper, the earth, is a
little irregular. Now, of course,-it is the rotation of the surface
of the earth which determines our standard time. I find it diffi-
cult to believe that there can be irregular variations in the angular
902 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

velocity of the earth as a whole; but it seems less difficult if the
variations are merely superficial, due to the crust sliding non-
uniformly on the interior. I have even entertained the wild idea that
the motion of the magnetic poles might be due to this cause; the mag-
netism being constant in the interior but with the axis emerging at
changing points of the crust as the crust slips over the inner magnet.
Unfortunately, so little seems to be known about the motion of the
magnetic poles that I have not even been able to make out whether
the motion is from west to east, as this theory definitely requires.

What interests the geologist more nearly is that the brake is applied
only at certain areas on the surface, so that there would be a tendency
to crumple the crust more particularly to the west of these areas? It
is unfortunate that shallow seas are necessarily the least permanent
features of the earth; otherwise I would have asked whether the
geologists had evidence of special crumpling in such areas.

I have regarded the crust as fairly mobile from east to west. I sup-
pose the geologists would also like it mobile from north to south in
order to have glacial periods in those portions which are now near
the Equator. It is not possible to hold out much encouragement for
such an idea, because we can not imagine any force acting from north
to south. Still if the crust, which is being urged by the east-west
force of tidal friction, is resisted by obstacles it may be deflected,
finding that, say, a southwest track offers less resistance. In a long
enough time almost any displacement may have happened, granting
my hypothesis that the connection of the crust to the interior is
reasonably plastic. So I can not forbid this possible interpretation
of glacial periods in the earlier geological times.

I am sure that it will not be supposed that, in presenting the
astronomical side of these questions which belong both to geology and
astronomy, I have any intention of laying down the law. The time
has gone by when the physicist prescribed dictatorially what theories
the geologist might be permitted to consider. You have your own
clues to follow out to elucidate these problems, and your clues may
be better than ours for leading toward the truth. We both recognize
that we are adventuring in regions of extreme uncertainty where
future discoveries will probably lead to various modifications of ideas.
Where, as in the new views of the age of the earth, physics, biology.
geology, astronomy, all seem to be leading in the same direction, and
producing evidence for a greatly extended time scale, we may feel
more confidence that a permanent advance is being made. Where our
clues seem to be opposed, it is not for one of us to dictate to the other,
but to accept with thankfulness the warning from a neighboring
science that all may not be so certain and straightforward as our own
one-sided view seemed to indicate.

8T am not sure whether I am right in assuming here that the frictional brake is applied
at the same points of the earth’s surface where the dissipation of energy occurs.
ATMOSPHERIC NITROGEN FIXATION?

tric Co.; now with the American Cyanamid Co.

[With 4 plates]

The three essential food constituents of living matter are carbo-
hydrates, fats, and proteins; the two former chiefly for the produc-
tion and storage of energy and the latter for building up the body
substance. They are alike in the respect that they all contain the
three elements carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen, but differ in that pro-
tein also contains nitrogen, which, therefore, becomes one of the in-
dispensable substances of life.

Nitrogen is a colorless, tasteless, and odorless gas, slightly lighter
than air. It comprises about four-fifths of the volume of the atmos-
phere, where it occurs in a free state mechanically mixed with
oxygen. In this free state, it is an exceedingly inert element and
combines only with difficulty with certain other elements as will be
explained later. In combined form, it is found chiefly in certain
natural nitrate deposits, and natural manures such as guano also
contain large quantities of nitrogen compounds.

FREE NITROGEN

The atmosphere is the inexhaustible source for our nitrogen sup-
ply, and every bit of nitrogen in plants, animals, and the soil has
originated from free atmospheric nitrogen. Arrhenius estimates
that no less than 400,000,000 tons of nitrogen are annually with-
drawn from the atmosphere; and as nitrogen does not accumulate
to any great extent in the soil, this enormous quantity must again be
set free as inert nitrogen gas by the decomposition of organic matter
and restored to the atmosphere. An immense and endless circulation
of nitrogen is therefore continually going on, as shown in the ac-
companying diagram. __

204 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Through the action of electrical discharges of thunderstorms,
which continually go on in the atmosphere, appreciable amounts of
free nitrogen in the air are converted into oxides of nitrogen which
are absorbed by falling rain water and enter the soil in the form
of nitric acid. This nitric acid then combines with the bases in the
soil, such as potassium, calcium, etc., and forms the corresponding
nitrates in which form they are taken up by the plants and
metabolized into protein.

Through the action of bacteria in their root nodules, certain
legumes, such as peas, beans, and clover, also possess the capacity of
directly absorbing free nitro-
gen from the air during
their growth and converting
it into protein.

It has thus been shown
how the nitrogen is supplied
to the plants and protein
metabolized which serves
not only as their own food
supply but also as reserve
food for the plants’ off-
spring. This now becomes
animal food and, for vege-
table eating animals, it is the
sole source of the nitrogen
for animal protein.

the urea much nitrogen is set free by the action of nitrous acid.
This urea and hippuric acid together with decayed vegetable and
animal matter—that is, dead protein—is then with the aid of
. bacteria converted into ammonia. Part of this is by means of
oxidizing bacteria converted into nitric acid and nitrate in which
form it again is partly assimilated by the plants. Part of this
nitrate is, however, dinitrified by bacteria, one portion reverting
into free nitrogen which goes back to the atmosphere, the other
being converted into ammonia which fails to oxidize and is volatil-
ized as a gas, which is absorbed by rain and again returned to the
soil. Part of the ammonia is also taken up directly by the plants
from the soil.

NEED FOR FERTILIZERS

The fertility of the soil would thus remain practically unchanged
if all the ingredients removed in the various farm products were
returned to the land where they come from. This is to some extent
accomplished by feeding the crops grown on the farm to animals,
carefully saving the manure and returning it to the soil. A care-
ful study of the present conditions of farming indicates, however,
that as a rule the manure produced on the farm is far from suffi-
cient to maintain its
fertility, and artifi-
cial fertilizers must
be resorted to.

therefore, come from inorganic materials. It would, of course, not
pay to fertilize to the above extent immediately, but it merely indi-
cates the extent to which nitrogen is needed for fertilizer purposes.

With our constantly increasing population, an increased food sup-
ply must be provided, and this can only be assured by increased
cultivation and fertilization of the soil. How far behind we lag in
this respect as compared with certain European countries, which of
necessity have been forced to an intensive use of fertilizer, is shown
by the following table:

Prior to the increased use of fertilizer in these countries, the pro-
ductivity of their soil was similar to our own, and the increase in
their food supply, without additional labor and at a cost wholly in-
commensurate with the gains, has grown in direct proportion to the
amount of fertilizer used.

Besides fertilizers, large amounts of nitrogen are also needed for
industrial purposes, and the requirements to meet this demand are
also steadily increasing.

Nitrate is one of the main ingredients in high explosives and gun
powder, and nitration, that is, the treatment of substances with nitric
acid, is the fundamental chemical operation in the production of
gun cotton for making smokeless powder, celluloid, or other pyroxylin
plastics from cotton or paper such as artificial ivory, etc. The dye
industry is also to a great extent based on nitration, and numerous
drugs, perfumes, and flavoring extracts are also being made in this
manner from the coal tar bases, benzol, toluol, and naphthalene.

It is difficult to predict with accuracy to what extent the nitrogen
fixation in this country will increase in the future. From statistics
presented at a hearing before Congress in 1920, it was estimated that
the possible consumption of fixed inorganic nitrogen would be as
follows:

1925 1930

To supply this need, it is further estimated that the available
production from by-product coke ovens will be, in 1925, 130,000
tons; in 1930, 160,000 tons.

The difference would then have to be supplied by importation of
Chile saltpeter or by increased products from atmospheric nitrogen
fixation plants. For this latter purpose, there are now three plants
in this country which with certain modifications would be available
and with a combined yearly production capacity equivalent to about
45,000 tons of fixed nitrogen per year. At present only one of these
plants is in operation, with a yearly output of only a few thousand
tons.

From these figures, it is obvious that we will have to continue to
rely to a great extent on the importation of Chile saltpeter, unless
steps are taken for providing increased facilities for fixation of
atmospheric nitrogen. It is the purpose of this article to describe
the different processes which at present are available for this pur-
NITROGEN FIXATION—LOF 207

pose, but, first, a brief reference will be made to the other two
sources of inorganic nitrogen, viz, Chile saltpeter and by-product
ammonium sulphate.

CHILE SALTPETER

Chile saltpeter is chemically known as sodium nitrate (NaNO,),
the commercial product containing about 95 per cent nitrate, of
which 1514 per cent is nitrogen. Like the potash deposits in Ger-
many, there are few natural deposits like the saltpeter deposits in
Chile on the west coast of South America. These deposits were
discovered by Indians about 1809, who, when lighting a fire, noticed
that the ground began to ignite in various directions. They at-
tributed this to evil spirits and consulted a priest, who caused the
earth to be examined, thus revealing the presence of nitrate of soda.

The nitrate deposits are located, at altitudes ranging from 2,000
to 6,000 feet, in the desert regions between the 12° and 26° latitudes,
a distance of about 500 miles, and perhaps the driest country in
the world, with no vegetation whatever.

The nitrate beds generally form horizontal layers covered by
three distinct layers or strata of silica, calcium sulphate, and other
minerals, the thickness of these layers ranging from 2 to several
feet. The nitrate as mined goes under the name “ caliche,” and the
deposits vary in thickness from a few inches to 4 or 5 feet or more.
It is like a cemented gravel, the cementing material being the so-
dium nitrate and sodium chloride and other salts which accompany
it. The caliche treated runs from 14 per cent nitrate up to as high
as 30 per cent or more, and it does not as yet pay to mine materials
with less than 13 to 14 per cent nitrate.

There are many theories advanced regarding the origin of these
natural nitrate deposits. Some think that they are original guano
deposits; others ascribe their origin to seaweed, because the caliche
contains considerable amounts of iodine, and fish skeletons are often
found embedded in the strata. Recent theories are that it has its
origin in volcanic actions.

PREPARATION OF THE NITRATE

The production of Chile saltpeter comes under two divisions—
the mining of the caliche and the refining. The caliche is extracted
from the ground by blasting and hand picking, after which it is
loaded in carts or light railroad cars and hauled to the refining
plants, called “ oficinas,” by mules or small locomotives. At the plant
it is crushed and leached with boiling water, when, due to the dif-
ferent solubility of the nitrate and chloride salts, practically all the
208 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

nitrate will be dissolved while the other salts, if already in solution,
will be precipitated. The solution is then allowed to cool and, due
to the solubility characteristics mentioned above, the nitrate crytal-
lizes out first while the other salts remain in the solution, which is
drained off. The nitrate, now in solid form, is placed in drying pans
to allow the remaining water to evaporate, and when entirely dry it
is packed in bags of about 200 pounds each and shipped by rail down
to the different harbors for export.

Most of the Chile saltpeter is used for fertilizer purposes, the nitro-
gen contained therein being extremely soluble and readily available
as food for plants. The nitrogen in this form is thus directly and
immediately available and no further changes are necessary.

Considerable amounts of Chile saltpeter are also used for industrial
purposes, in which case it must be converted in some other form, the
starting point as a rule being nitric acid. This conversion is ac-
complished by treating the sodium nitrate with sulphuric acid, when
a violent reaction takes place, with the result of the formation of
nitric acid which is given off as a gas. This passes into condensers
where it is condensed to liquid acid. The reaction takes place accord-
ing to the formula:

NaNO,+H,SO,=HNO,+NaHSO,

tion, which also gives the export to the United States and its equiva-
lent nitrogen content in net tons.

It is interesting to note how the export dropped in 1915, when the
supply of the Central powers in Europe was cut off, and how it
since steadily increased until the end of the war, when it again took
a big drop.
NITROGEN FIXATION—LOF 209

The proceeds obtained from the export duty imposed by the Chile
Government amounts to about 40 per cent of that country’s yearly
revenue.

The question is often asked: How long will the Chile deposits
last? There is quite a difference of opinion in regard to this. It is
estimated that the contents of the surveyed areas contained about
300,000,000 tons of nitrate of which about 50,000,000 tons have been
mined, leaving about 250,000,000 tons untouched. At the present
rate of production this would last about 100 years. It is claimed
that the unsurveyed areas are some thirty times larger than the
surveyed ones, but undoubtedly of a much lower nitrate content, and
it is quite safe to assert that the deposits would last another 250 or
300 years. On the other hand, it is almost certain that long before
that time new artificial nitrogen fixation processes will have been
developed, by means of which it will be possible to manufacture
nitrogen compounds at a much lower cost than the cost of Chile salt-
peter, so that the mining of Chile saltpeter will undoubtedly be very
materially curtailed long before these deposits are exhausted.

BY-PRODUCT AMMONIA

The by-product coke-oven industry now occupies a vital place
for the supply of nitrogen in the form of ammonia. Besides am-
monia, the carbonization of the coal in these ovens gives us many
other valuable by-products such as benzol, toluol, and napthalene.

It is interesting to watch how these modern by-product coke plants
rapidly supersede the old-fashioned beehive ovens, as may be seen
from the foregoing tabulation.

A by-product coke oven is a rather complicated structure, but
briefly it consists of a large number of parallel chambers or ovens in
which the bituminous coal is heated out of contact with the air.
210 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

The ovens are separated by flues in which part of the gas generated
by the distillation is burned to provide the heat necessary for the
coking.

It is from the volatile matter in the coal given off that the by-
products are obtained. The ammonia is thus the result of the union
of nitrogen and hydrogen, according to some reaction which is
not fully known.

The coal contains from 1 to 114 per cent nitrogen, and of this only
about 15 per cent is recovered in the form of ammonia. This means
that we only get about 7 pounds of ammonia per ton of coke.
The hot gases from the ovens containing the ammonia are cooled
and scrubbed with water to remove the tar. They then go to
saturators filled with sulphuric acid, and when the gas bubbles
through this acid an intimate contact is established between the two
and ammonium sulphate is precipitated as a solid salt according to
the reaction 2 NH,+H,SO,=(NH,).SO,.

The ammonium sulphate thus formed in the saturators is then
drained and dried in centrifugal driers, after which it is ready for
sale. It then contains 24 per cent of ammonia equivalent to about
20 per cent of nitrogen.

The remainder of the gas, now freed from ammonia, after leav-
ing the saturators may then be further scrubbed with absorbent oils
for recovery of other by-products, and if the gas is to be used for
municipal purposes it must be further purified by removing any
sulphur that it may contain.

product coke oven plants is said to be about 35,000,000 tons of coke,
which would correspond to a maximum ammonium sulphate output
of about 550,000 tons, equivalent to 110,000 tons of combined
nitrogen.
NITROGEN FIXATION—LOF Od

The ammonium sulphate production is, however, closely related
to the steel-mill business, and the recent slack in this industry was
clearly reflected in the coke production, and naturally also the am-
monium sulphate output, as shown in the foregoing tabulation.

THE ARC PROCESS

The principle underlying this process is the possibility of chemic-
ally uniting part of the free nitrogen and oxygen in the air at such
high temperatures as only the electric arc is capable of producing,
this being around 5,000° to 6,000° F.

Air, which is-only a mechanical mixture of nitrogen and oxygen.
is thus passed through an electric are furnace, when a small part
(about 2 per cent) of these elements combine chemically and form
nitric oxide, NO. This gas, when leaving the furnace, has a tem-
perature of around 1,500° to 1,800° F., and in order to prevent the
NO from dissociating or breaking up, it must be rapidly cooled to
a temperature around 100° F., which is done in two steps. The hot
gas is first passed through ordinary steam boilers, which thus serve as
coolers, with recovery of heat in the form of steam for use in other
parts of the process. The temperature of the gas is lowered to about
300° F. by these boilers, but below this point it becomes necessary to
carry out the further cooling in aluminum coolers through which
water circulates, without, of course, coming in direct contact with
the gas. The reason for this is the fact that nitric oxide at these low
temperatures, in the presence of moisture in the gas from water leak-
ing through the tubes, begins to oxidize to nitric acid, which cor-
rodes iron but not aluminum.

From the aluminum coolers the gas mixture is now conveyed to an
oxidation chamber, a big sheet-steel tank lined with fire brick. The
purpose of this oxidation tank is to give the gas sufficient time to
oxidize the nitric oxide NO to nitrogen peroxide, NO, or N,O,, this
being desirable for the absorption of the gas which is to follow.

From the oxidation tank the gas is carried through an absorption
system consisting of several groups of absorption towers, usually
five towers in series per group. These towers are of enormous size,
the inside being filled with lumps of quartz or other materials which
the acid will not attack. Water is admitted to the top of the third
tower, and when it trickles down over the quartz filling it meets the
ascending gas and is converted into a weak nitric acid. This acid is
then pumped to the top of the second tower, where it is used as the
absorption liquid, and similarly the acid from the second tower is
used for absorption in the first tower, thus gradually increasing in
strength. After having thus passed the third tower, about 80 per
cent of the NO, gas has been absorbed, and this is about all that can
219 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

be absorbed by water, the resulting acid from the first tower having
a strength of 30 per cent, this being known as weak nitric acid.

The reaction which thus has taken place in the three first towers
is as follows: 3 NO,+H,O=2 HNO,+NO.

The liberated nitric oxide, in the presence of oxygen and water, is
again converted into nitrogen peroxide and nitric acid.

The remaining 20 per cent of the gas leaving the third tower is now
so weak that another solution than water must be provided for its
absorption. An alkali solution such as soda ash is used for this pur-
pose in towers 4 and 5, the resulting product being a mixture of
sodium nitrate and sodium. nitrite, which is evaporated and may be
used directly as a fertilizer. If only sodium nitrite is desired the gas
is passed into a solution of caustic soda.

The weak acid from the first tower is, however, the main product;
but as such a weak acid can not be economically transported, it must
be converted into some neutral salt or changed into concentrated acid
of 95 per cent strength, which can be shipped in aluminum tank cars.
The concentration is accomplished by means of sulphuric acid, which
has a greater affinity for the water in the weak nitric acid, thus ab-
sorbing it, leaving the nitric acid in concentrated form.

The neutral salt, generally produced from the weak acid, is cal-
cium nitrate, also known as nitrate of lime or Norway saltpeter,
because it is the main product of the large nitrate plants in Nor-
way. The calcium nitrate Ca(NO,),, is thus produced by treating
ordinary limestone with the weak acid, the reaction being as fol-
lows: CaCO,+2 HNO,=Ca(NO,),+H,O0+CO,.

The resulting solution is evaporated by the waste heat from the
steam boilers before mentioned, and the product is then ready for the
market.

This calcium nitrate contains 13 per cent of fixed nitrogen, and
is, like Chile saltpeter, an excellent fertilizer, although somewhat
hygroscopic. It is, as stated, the main product of the large Rjukan
nitrate plants in Norway, which have an annual productive capacity
of about 200,000 tons of nitrate, equivalent to about 26,000 tons of
fixed nitrogen. Over 300,000 electrical horsepower are used for
this, generated in magnificent high-head water-power plants. The
power requirements with this process are thus about 12 horsepower |
years per ton nitrogen fixed, and from this high rate of consump-
tion it follows that the price of the power must be very low in order
to make the process an economic success.

The majority of the furnaces used at Rjukan are of the Birke-
land-Eyde type, the latest designs having a capacity of 4,000 to
5,000 horsepower each. There are also some Schoenherr furnaces of
1,000 horsepower capacity each. Numerous other types of furnaces
NITROGEN FIXATION—LOF Zio

have been proposed and patented, but none except the above-men-
tioned types have come into any general use. With the exception of
the above-mentioned large plants in Norway, the process has had a
very limited use. One plant of moderate size has been in operation
in France, and the activities in this country have so far been con-
fined to two smal] installations, one in the West and one in the South.

THE CYANAMID PROCESS

The cyanamid process is based on the ability of calcium carbide
to absorb free nitrogen, forming a nitrogen compound known as
calcium cyanamid, or more generally under its commercial name of
simply cyanamid.

The calcium carbide is produced in huge electric electrode fur-
naces in capacities up to as high as 20,000 electrical horsepower each.
The furnaces are kept filled with a mixtuft of calcined lime and coke,
and the electric current passing through the mixture between the
electrodes melts the lime to a liquid which then combines with the
coke in the interior of the furnace, forming calcium carbide, the
reaction being as follows: CaO-+-3C=CaC,+CO.

The furnace is tapped every 15 to 20 minutes into chill cars, the
carbide when leaving the furnace having a temperature of about
4,000° F.

A supply of pure nitrogen free from oxygen is essential with the
cyanamid process. It is obtained by liquefying air under intense
cooling and high pressure. Such liquid air machines work under
pressures of 500 pounds per square inch, and with cooling by ex-
pansion the air is reduced to liquid form at 380° F. below zero. By
then allowing this liquid air to warm up slightly, pure nitrogen gas
boils off first, leaving the oxygen behind in the liquid. The nitrogen
is then pumped to the fixation building.

After the carbide has cooled in the cars, it is crushed and pow-
dered. It is then placed in cylindrical perforated paper cylinders in
the fixation ovens, and nitrogen from the liquid-air plant is ad-
mitted. The ovens are then heated by passing an electric current
through a carbon rod which extends through the center of the charge.
Due to this heat and the heat from the exothermic reaction, a tem-
perature of about 2,000° F. is reached in the ovens. The carbide
absorbs the nitrogen, forming a new chemical compound, calcium
cyanamid. The nitrogen fixation is represented by the equation:
CaC,+N,=CaCN,+C.

When the absorption is complete, the charge is removed from the
oven, allowed to cool, and crushed to a powder. It is then hydrated
or treated with a small quantity of water to remove the last traces

1454—25——_15
214 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

of carbide and to slake any free lime present. Sometimes it is also
treated with a small amount of oil to prevent dusting. It is then
known by the trade name “ Cyanamid,” and has a nitrogen content of
about 19 to 21 per cent.

Cyanamid is extensively used as an ingredient in mixed fertilizers,
but during the past few years it has also been used to a great extent
as a source of nitrogen for making other products such as ammonia,
various ammonium compounds, nitric acid, etc. The next step for
either of these is the production of ammonia, which is obtained by
heating cyanamid with steam under pressure in so-called autoclaves,
when the nitrogen is given off as ammonia gas. This gas may be
absorbed in water, producing aqua ammonia, which is used in large
quantities for refrigeration and for many general chemical purposes.
It may also be used for producing anhydrous ammonia by drying
the gas and compressing it, Such ammonia is also used extensively
for refrigeration purposes.

By absorbing the ammonia gas in sulphuric acid, sulphate of
ammonia is formed, which is separated out by crystallization in the
same manner as previously explained under the by-product coke oven
process.

Similarly, by absorbing the ammonia gas in nitric acid, ammonium
nitrate is formed, which is used to a Jarge extent in high explosives.
The nitric acid required for this product may also be obtained from
the ammonia gas by oxidation of the ammonia in the presence of a
heated catalyst, usually platinum, according to the following reaction:
4NH,+50,=4NO-+6H,0.

A mixture of about 10 volumes of ammonia gas and 90 volumes of
air is passed over a spongy platinum screen of very fine mesh,
heated electrically to a dull red heat, the temperature with the gas
passing over it being about 1,000° F. The gas velocity must be very
high so as to cut down the time of contact between the gas and the
catalyzer to about one one-hundredth of a second. The efficiency of
conversion is quite high, about 90 per cent, and the resulting strength
of the nitric oxide gas about 8 to 9 per cent, as compared to 2 per cent
with the are process.

The nitric oxide after leaving the catalytic burners is thereafter
treated in the same manner as with the are process; that is, it is
passed through oxidation tanks, steam boilers, and aJuminum coolers
and finally to the absorption towers. The absorption system is, how-
ever, much smaller than with the are process, due to the much higher
concentration of the nitric oxide, and for the same reason the weak
acid will have.a strength of about 45 per cent instead of 30 per cent
as with the are process.

There are a large number of cyanamid plants throughout the
world, their total annual productive capacity being possibly in the
NITROGEN FIXATION—LOF 215

neighborhood of 1,250,000 tons of cyanamid, equivalent to a fixed
nitrogen content of about 250,000 tons. Based on a power require-
ment corresponding to 214 tons of cyanamid per electrical horse-

power year, or 2 horsepower years per ton nitrogen fixed as cyanamid,
the power for this total output would be no less than one-half mil-
lion horsepower years. As compared to the arc process, the relative
power consumption for the cyanamid process per ton fixed nitrogen
is only one-sixth of what it is for the arc process.
216 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

The large Government nitrate plant at Muscle Shoals, Ala., built
according to the cyanamid process, is generally known under the
name of United States Nitrate Plant No. 2, and was built for the
Government in 1918 for the production of ammonium nitrate for
military explosives, the productive capacity of the plant being 110,-
000 tons of this product per year. The plant was constructed by the
Air Nitrates Corporation, a subsidiary to the American Cyanamid
Co., whose process was followed. Incidentally, it might be stated
that the plant was completed shortly after the armistice, and one unit
(one-fifth the plant capacity) was thereafter put through a two
weeks’ complete test operation, which thoroughly demonstrated the
technical success of the undertaking.

THE CYANIDE PROCESS

The fixation of nitrogen in the form of alkali cyanides has not
reached any commercial importance, although considerable research
work has been done along these lines and a few small plants actually
constructed. One of these plants was built by the Government dur-
ing the war at Saltville, Va. Its capacity was very small, only 10
tons of sodium cyanide per day, the plans being to convert this cya-
nide into the highly poisonous gas, hydrocyanic acid, for the war.

The process of fixation on which the Saltville plant was based is
known as the Bucher process, the reaction involved therein being as
follows: Na,CO,+4C--N,=2NaCN+3CoO.

The raw materials are soda ash and coke in pulverized form to
which iron, also in powdered form, is added, its action, however, be-
ing purely catalytic. This material is formed into briquettes, thor-
oughly dried, and then heated in retorts at a temperature around
1,500° F., while nitrogen is passed through the mass. As high as
i8 per cent of nitrogen has thus been fixed in the form of cyanide.

When sodium cyanide is once formed it can be converted into am-
monia like cyanamid, and the process has the advantage that in this
conversion the soda ash can be recovered and used over again.
The iron can also be repeatedly used.

A cyanide process has also quite recently been invented in Sweden.
A moderate size plant was built and operated for some time, but is
now closed down, and the opinions of specialists seem to be divided
as to the commercial success of the process.

The process is of the continuously operated type, the materials be-
ing kept in continuous circulation in such a manner that the nitrified
portions are decomposed into ammonia, leaving a solid residue which
is returned to the nitrification building with the addition of some
fresh material.
NITROGEN FIXATION—LOF 217

The raw material, consisting of anthracite, sodium carbonate, and
iron sponge, is formed into small balls, in which shape they are fed
into the furnaces. These are of the shaft type, the material resting
on grates which are intermittently turned in order to facilitate dis-
charging and to avoid baking. The furnaces are further of the elec-
trode type, operating on the resistance principle, the balls themselves
conducting the electric current from one electrode to the other and
becoming in this way heated to the temperature required for the re-
action, which is around 1,700° F. The nitrogen, under pressure, is
admitted directly at the bottom of the furnace, and the gases are
given off at the top. They contain principally hydrogen and carbon
oxide, which are afterwards used as fuel gas for the nitrogen ovens
and for drying purposes, etc. The bottom of the furnace is connected
to an air-tight conveying system for transporting the cyanide to
the ammonium-sulphate building.

A large surplus quantity of nitrogen is needed for the fixation,
and a method has been worked out for its production at a very low
cost. The process is chemical, the oxygen of the air being bound by
an alkali iron to Fe,O,, setting the nitrogen free. This ferric oxide
is then reduced by the above-mentioned waste gas from the furnaces
and the iron used over again. In practice, air is not used in the
manufacture of the nitrogen, but the waste gases from the sulphuric
acid factory, as these gases contain only a few per cent of oxygen,
thus materially reducing the energy required for binding the oxygen.

The cyanide from the furnaces is, as mentioned, conveyed to the
ammonia department where ammonium sulphate is produced in the
same manner as for cyanamid, with the exception that the sludge left
in the autoclaves after. proper treatment is used again as raw ma-
terial for the furnace charge.

The power consumption with this process is claimed to be about
114 horsepower years per ton nitrogen fixed as cyanide.

Sodium cyanide is also made by fusing cyanamid with ordinary
salt in an, electric furnace. This product is extensively used for
case-hardening of steel, for the separation of gold from its ore, and
for the manufacture of hydrocyanic acid for fumigation of fruit
trees. Large quantities of such cyanide is manufactured by the
American Cyanamid Co. at their Niagara Falls plant.

THE NITRIDE PROCESS

The fundamental principle underlying this process is the combina-
tion of nitrogen with metals, such as aluminum, titanium, lithium,
etc., to form nitrides from which ammonia can readily be obtained
by decomposition.
218 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

The best-developed process of this type is the so-called Serpek
process for making aluminum nitride from bauxite (aluminum ox-
ide), coke, and nitrogen according to the reaction: Al,O,-+38C-L-N,
—2AIN+3 CO.

Bauxite mixed with carbon is fed into the upper end of an in-
clined revolving kiln, the necessary heat for heating the mixture to
the required reaction temperature of around 3,200° F., being sup-
plied by electric current. Producer gas, containing about 30 per
cent CO and 70 per cent N,, enters the lower end of the kiln and
passes through the same in a direction opposite to that of the de-
scending charge, and in the electrically heated zone the nitrogen re-
acts with the alumina-carbon mixture and forms aluminum nitride,
containing about 26 per cent of fixed nitrogen. The carbon mon-
oxide also formed by the reaction is being used for preheating the
charge before it enters the kiln.

Ammonia is then formed by treating the aluminum nitride in
autoclaves, this reaction being as follows: AIN+3H,O—Al1 (OH),
+NH,. .

In addition to the ammonia, a very pure alumina is obtained,
which can be used for metallic aluminum production. The power
required is approximately the same as for the cyanamid process;
that is, about 2 horsepower years per ton nitrogen fixed as nitride.

Like the cyanide process, the nitride process has not been of any
great importance in connection with the nitrogen-fixation problem.
A few moderate-size plants have been built in this country and
abroad, but it can hardly be said that the process has as yet been
fully developed.

THE HABER PROCESS

This process, named after its inventor, Prof. Fritz Haber, of Ger-
many, was introduced there shortly before the war, and was one of
the most important factors of insuring Germany of an ample supply
of nitrogen during the war, and this with a much lower power re-
quirement than any of the synthetic processes previously described.
Germany now possesses two enormous Haber plants at Oppau and at
Merseburg. The former, where the terrible explosion occurred in 1921,
has a productive capacity equivalent to 100,000 tons of fixed nitrogen
per year, and the Merseburg plant twice this; thus a total of 300,000
tons nitrogen per year. Two plants, but of comparatively small
capacity, have been built in this country. One of these was built
by the Government at Sheffield, Ala., during the war, but has never
been in actual operation, except what might be termed experimental
operation. The other plant was built in 1921 by the Semet-Solvay
Co. at Syracuse, N. Y. The process of these two plants is a modi- ©
fication of the German Haber process developed by the General
NITROGEN FIXATION—LOF 919

Chemical Co., the operating pressure being only about one-half that
which is used in Germany.

The Haber process consists, briefly, in passing a mixture of 1
volume of nitrogen and 8 volumes of hydrogen (the constituents of
ammonia) at a pressure of from 100 to 200 atmospheres over a suit-
able catalyzer at a temperature of some 900° to 1,000° F. - The nitro-
gen and hydrogen will then combine and form ammonia according
to the reaction: N,+3H,—2NH,.

A single passage of the gas mixture through the catalytic cham-
ber causes a conversion of about 6 to 8 per cent (by volume) of the
nitrogen-hydrogen mixture to ammonia, this being recovered either
by refrigeration and condensation to anhydrous ammonia or by ab-
sorption in water to aqua ammonia, which can again be converted
into gaseous form by distillation. The unconverted nitrogen and
hydrogen mixture, still under the above pressure, is replenished with
a fresh gas mixture corresponding to the separated ammonia, after
which it is reheated and returned to the catalytic chamber, thus re-
peating the cycle. .

Besides the mechanical difficulties due to the high pressures at
which the process is operated, the solution of the very complicated
chemical problems which are involved has required an enormous
amount of experimental and research work. It is absolutely essen-
tial that the two gases, nitrogen and hydrogen be in a very pure
state, as even minute quantities of impurities such as carbon mon-
oxide will be poisonous to the catalytic material and the two gases
will refuse to combine, or do so at a very reduced rate. It is this
preparation and purification of the nitrogen and hydrogen, and espe-
cially the latter, which comprises the chief items of cost in the Haber
process.

The problem of providing a durable and suitable catalyst has also
been a difficult one. The reaction when the two gases combine to
form ammonia can only take place in the presence of what is known
as “catalytic” metals. A catalyst, therefore, is simply a substance
which promotes the union of two elements with each other, without
itself entering into the combination.

Water is naturally the source from which hydrogen is produced,
either chemically or by electrolysis. In the former method, water
gas is first generated in a gas producer in the ordinary way by pass-
ing steam over incandescent coke. This gas consists of one-half
volume of hydrogen, the other one-half being chiefly carbon monox-
ide, as seen from the following equation: C-+-H,O=CO-+H,,.

In order to remove this carbon monoxide it is found desirable
to convert it into carbon dioxide, which can readily be separated
by water scrubbing at a pressure of around 25 to 30 atmospheres.
220 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

The equation for the reaction is CO+H,+H,O=CO,+2H,, and it
is caused by letting an additional quantity of steam react on the gas
in a special converter, also with the help of a suitable catalyst. The
advantage of this method is obviously that twice the amount of
hydrogen is obtained with the same gas producer. The pressure is
obtained with no extra cost because the gas must sooner or later,
anyhow, be compressed to a still higher pressure, as previously stated.

Pure hydrogen can be produced by electrolysis of water, but in
order that this method shall be commercially feasible cheap power
is essential.

The process used at the Government Synthetic Ammonia Plant at
Sheffield, Ala., was a modified water-gas process by which the hydro-
gen and the nitrogen is produced simultaneously. It is thus possible
to directly provide a mixture in the right proportions, if instead of
steam, a mixture of air and steam is passed over the incandescent
coke in the gas producer; or, in other words, if instead of water gas,
a semiwater gas is produced consisting of 5 volumes of hydrogen,
7 volumes of carbon monoxide, and 4 volumes of nitrogen. After
the 7 volumes of carbon monoxide have been converted into 7 vol-
umes of carbon dioxide and hydrogen, in the manner previously
explained, and the gas freed from carbon dioxide, then it contains
evidently 12 volumes of hydrogen and 4 volumes of nitrogen or
hydrogen and nitrogen in the correct proportions, 3:1, for ammonia.
The following equations will possibly make this clearer:

Steam Air
5H,0+7C+4N,+0,=5H.,+7C0-4N,
7CO+7H,O0=7CO,-+-7H,

Adding the hydrogen and nitrogen values from the right-hand
side of these two equations, we thus get 5H,+7H,+4N,=12H,+
4N,—=8NH,. In the German Haber plants the hydrogen is produced
by the water-gas method and the nitrogen by separate lean-gas
producers. Some free nitrogen is also required around the plant
for various purposes, especially for adjusting the hydrogen-nitrogen
mixture before it enters the synthetic reaction chamber. This nitro-
gen is made by the liquid-air distillation method. This process
could, of course, be used for manufacturing all the nitrogen re-
quired, but it is a question whether it will be economical unless
cheap power can be obtained for driving the refrigerating com-
pressors.

The gases, after leaving the respective producers, are first thor-
oughly washed by water separately. The main purification, however,
is done after the gases have been mixed, and consists in first wash-
ing the gas with water under a pressure of around 25 atmospheres
for removing the bulk of the carbon dioxide. After this the gas is
NITROGEN FIXATION—LOF 221

brought up to the final process pressure of 100 to 200 atmospheres

and washed with chemical solutions for removing the final traces
of CO and CO.,, after which it is passed through the catalytic am-
monia reaction chamber. In the Sheffield plant the gas mixture is
brought up to its final pressure of 100 atmospheres in one step, and
the water scrubbing for removing the carbon dioxide is done at
this pressure.

The gases which have been converted to ammonia in the catalytic
chamber are removed by means of refrigeration or water absorption
and the uncombined gases returned to the system to be passed
through the catalyzer chamber again until finally combined. The
ammonia may be sold as anhydrous or aqua, or absorbed in sulphuric
acid or phosphoric acid to produce ammonium sulphate or ammo-
nium phosphate, the same as with the other processes, or a portion
may be oxidized and absorbed to form nitric acid, in which the re-
maining portion of the ammonia may be absorbed to form am-
monium nitrate.

In producing hydrogen for synthetic ammonia by the water-gas
method, it has been shown how large quantities of carbon dioxide
have to be eliminated in the purification. As in the Solvay soda
process thousands of tons of carbon dioxide are used each year for
which large quantities of limestone are burned, it follows at once
that the two processes can advantageously be worked together.

The ammonia gas and the carbon dioxide are passed into a brine
solution, and the products-obtained are sodium bicarbonate and am-
monium chloride, NaCl+H,O0+CO,+NH,=NaHCO,+NH,Cl. The
sodium bicarbonate, NaHCO,, is readily converted into soda ash,
Na,CO,, by heating when it loses all its water and part of its carbon
dioxide gas, 2NaHCO,=Na,CO,+CO,+H,O- Soda ash or sodium
carbonate is extensively used in the glass, soap, paper, textile, and
numerous other industries.

The ammonium chloride, NH,Cl, after proper concentration and
drying, is at once ready for the market. It is claimed, but not sub-
stantiated, that ammonium chloride, which is a more concentrated
nitrogen product than the sulphate and meets the other require-
ments also, is equal to the sulphate in fertilizer properties, just as
potassium chloride is as available for crops as potassium sulphate.

The power requirements for the Haber process are very low unless
the hydrogen should be produced by electrolysis and the nitrogen
by liquid-air distillation. The reason for this is, of course, the fact
that electricity does not enter into any of the reactions but is chiefly
used for motive power.

Where the nitrogen and hydrogen are provided by the gas producer
method the power requirements will amount to about one-half horse-

1454—25——_16
222 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

power years per ton nitrogen fixed as ammonia, while if electrolytic
hydrogen and liquid-air nitrogen is produced the corresponding fig-
ure would be around 234 horsepower years.

THE CLAUDE PROCESS

This process, the invention of M. Claude, of France, is a modifi-
cation of the Haber process. It is as yet more or less in the experi-
mental stage, but seems to offer great possibilities. Claude thus
works with a pressure of 900 atmospheres as compared to 200 with
the Haber process. By means of this high pressure about 40 per
cent ammonia conversion is obtained per catalyzer unit, and the
endothermic reaction will raise the temperature of the catalyst to
the required temperature of 900° to 1,000° F. with only a slight pre-
heating, which is readily provided by simply passing the gas through
an outer passage in the catalytic chamber. By using three catalyzer
units in series, 80 per cent of the gases is converted into ammonia
and only 20 per cent needs to be recirculated. The ammonia is
readily removed by simply cooling it in a coil submerged in water,
when practically all the ammonia will liquefy.

The hydrogen and nitrogen may be obtained in the same manner
as with the Haber process previously described. It is claimed, how-
ever, that the hydrogen from producer gas can be very efficiently
purified at this super pressure. The compressed gas is passed
through ether at a low temperature, when all the gases but the hydro-
gen are dissolved by the ether. The solvent with the gases in solu-
tion is drained off, and when expanding to atmospheric pressure the
dissolved gases escape, leaving the solvent ready for reuse.

THE CASALE PROCESS?

This is also a synthetic ammonia process which has been developed
in Italy, where it is said to be used in one or two plants. It operates
at a pressure around 600 atmospheres, or considerably higher than
the Haber process, for which reason a higher ammonia conversion
should be expected. It is also claimed that a very satisfactory
catalyzer has been found which is less affected by impurities in the
hydrogen and nitrogen gases.

THE PLACE OF PROTEINS IN THE DIET IN THE LIGHT
OF THE NEWER KNOWLEDGE OF NUTRITION *

H. H. MircwHett, Ph. D.
Associate professor of animal nutrition, University of Illinois

The functions of food in the animal body include, first, the fur-
nishing of fuel for conversion into the various forms of energy that
characterize living matter, and, second, the furnishing of material
for the growth aide upkeep of the body itself. From the fact that
the solid matter of the active tissues of the body is so largely com-
posed of protein, it is obvious that dietary protein is of the utmost
importance in serving this second function of food.

In the utilization of food protein by animals, just as in the utiliza-

-tion of food energy, a certain wastage of material seems to be in-
evitable. The first wastage is due to incomplete digestibility. There
is a marked difference in the digestibility of the proteins of different
foods. The animal proteins in particular seem to be completely
digested, or very nearly so, when not dried or overcooked, the white
of egg constituting an exception to this statement. The proteins of
cereals, vegetables, and fruits occupy an intermediate position, being
only about 85 per cent digestible. Egg albumin is also of about this
digestibility. The proteins of the legumes possess digestion coeffi-
cients of 80 or less.

However, these differences in the digestibility of proteins do not in
the main depend upon chemical differences existing between them,
but rather upon the presence in the food of indigestible carbohyd-
rates, such as celluloses, hemicelluloses, and pentosans. Mendel and
Fine have shown? (1) some years ago that these differences largely
disappear when the vegetable proteins are fed in a more nearly pure
condition. They found that the proteins of wheat were as well uti-
lized as the proteins of meat, and that the proteins of barley and of
corn were also probably as well digested. With regard to the pro-
teins of soy beans, navy beans, and peas, they concluded that the
presence of indigestible nonnitrogenous materials can not entirely

account for their low coefficients of digestion. These proteins ap-
peared to be less readily and completely disintegrated by the diges-
tive processes than the cereal proteins. This resistance to enzyme
hydrolysis was even more pronounced with cottonseed proteins.

An interesting light has been thrown upon the digestibility of the
proteins of many of the legumes by recent investigations by Jones
and his associates in the Bureau of Chemistry (2). In these studies
it has been shown that the digestibility of the proteins from certain
legumes, including the white bean, the lima bean, and the Chinese
and Georgia velvet beans, is much improved by cooking. The value
of these proteins in growth experiments on rats in large part de-
pended upon whether or not the proteins were cooked or uncooked.
No explanation of this effect of cooking has been given, since it is
not predictable from any of the known properties of proteins. About
the same time Langworthy (3) and associates reported experiments
on men indicating that with most starches cooking is not essential
to complete digestibility, though from what is known of the solu-
bility of starch and its physical condition as deposited in plant
tissues, it has been widely taught that raw starch is very poorly
utilized in digestion. The improvement in the digestibility of raw
egg white by cooking is well known, though an unaccountable dis-
crepancy exists among the published reports of experiments con-
cerned with this question.

While the wastage of protein in digestion thus seems to be largely
unrelated to its chemical structure and composition, the wastage of
protein in metabolism in covering the protein requirements of the
body is generally ascribed entirely to the chemical structure of the
food protein. From our knowledge of the amino acid make-up of
proteins, and of the marked differences in this particular among food
proteins, it is readily understandable that the chemical structure of
a protein may seriously limit its usefulness to the body. The value
of the digestible protein of a food in meeting the protein require-
ments of the body, allowance being made for this wastage of protein
in metabolism, is known as the biological value.

Prominent among investigations of the biological values of pro-
teins, is the work of Thomas (4), reported 13 years ago, and still
the most complete study of its kind. Thomas’ results are based
upon nitrogen balance studies upon himself, and his biological values
of the proteins tested express the number of parts of body protein
replacable by 100 parts of digestible food protein. This method,
therefore, measures the capacity of food proteins in replacing the
nitrogenous constituents of the tissues disintegrated and lost in the
so-called “ wear and tear” processes of the body, or, in the terms of
PROTBINS IN THE DIET—MITCHELL 225

Folin’s theory, the endogenous catabolism. Thomas has given to
meat, milk, and fish, values approximating 100, indicating complete
utilization of the absorbed nitrogen. On the other hand, to the pro-
teins of corn and wheat have been given values of 30 and 40,
respectively, while the proteins of rice, potatoes, and peas are graded
88, 79, and 56, in order. Thus, according to Thomas, animal proteins
are two to three times more valuable in adult nutrition than the
cereal proteins. Attempts to confirm Thomas’ results have not been
particularly successful, and several flaws can be found in the plan-
ning of his experiments and in his method of selecting some results
and discarding others in computing average biological values. The
selection of some experimental results in preference to others is al-
ways a hazardous undertaking.

More recent determinations of the biological values of proteins
have in general indicated smaller differences between animal and
vegetable proteins than those shown by the results of Thomas. Mar-
tin and Robison (5) in a recent report have given to wheat proteins
a value of 35 and to milk proteins a value of only 51. In analogous
experiments on pigs, McCollum (6) has found that at low levels of
intake the nitrogen of corn, oats, and wheat seemed to be entirely
utilized in the processes of repair. In later experiments (7) on
growing pigs at higher levels of intake, results were obtained which,
when recalculated according to the method of Thomas, give values
of 42 to 48 for the proteins of corn, oats, and wheat, a value of 67
for casein, and a value of 80 for the proteins of milk. Thus, ac-
cording to these values, the cereal proteins do not seem to be so
greatly inferior to milk proteins, even in growing animals, as the
values of Thomas would indicate. The evidence obtained by Sher-
man (8) in his experiments on the efficiency of diets consisting
essentially of wheat bread or of corn meal or oatmeal supplemented
by only small amounts of milk, also indicate a higher value for these
proteins in adult nutrition than have generally been assigned to them.

The work of Osborne and Mendel (9), using an entirely different
method, also assigns to the cereal proteins values much nearer those
of animal proteins than the work of Thomas. In work on growing
rats, using rations complete in every respect except for the protein
contained in them, they have expressed the relative values for growth
of the proteins tested as the increase in weight (in a four or eight
week period) per gram of protein consumed. For the proteins of
barley, rye, oats, and wheat, average values of 1.4 to 1.9 grams of
gain per gram of protein consumed were obtained. These values
may be compared with values of 2.3 and 1.7 obtained for lactalbumin
and casein, respectively, in eight-week feeding periods with rats of
226 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

comparable weight. Lactalbumin, when fed with certain nonprotein
constituents of milk, as in these trials, has been found to be the
most efficient protein of all those tested. On the other hand, for the
endosperm proteins of wheat contained in patent white flour, the low
value of 0.5 gram of gain per gram of protein consumed was ob-
tained. In covering the maintenance requirement of the rat, however,
these investigators (10) have shown that the endosperm proteins are
just about as efficient as the proteins of the entire grain.

In the last five years, at the Annual Nutrition Laboratory of the
University of Illinois, we have conducted a large number of nitrogen
balance studies on rats, designed to test the comparative value of
the proteins from a number of foods. The results obtained have
been used in the calculation of biological values entirely analogous
to those of Thomas. We have found that when proteins are fed
at a low level, 5 per cent or less of the ration, the utilization of the
absorbed nitrogen is in general good regardless of the type of
protein fed. The following values represent the average utiliza-
tion of the absorbed nitrogen of different proteins in covering the
nitrogenous requirements of the body when fed at a level permitting
little or no growth.

These figures may be taken as representing the values of the
digestible nitrogen from the different foods in repairing the damages
that the tissues sustain in the course of their endogenous catabolism,
whatever the nature and purpose of that process may be. Too much
significance, of course, should not be attached to the small differences
between adjacent figures in the table, although differences of 10 or
more are probably significant. Each figure is the average of dupli-
cate determinations (seven-day balance periods) on four or more rats.
With the exception of the proteins of the white or navy bean, the
proteins of the foods examined all seemed to be fairly well utilized.
The superiority of the proteins of milk and beef was to be expected.
though the high value of the proteins of rice and oats was a matter
of surprise. In some individual tests the proteins of rice (brown,
unpolished) seemed to be completely utilized. The relative in-
feriority of casein depends upon its low cystine content, since, by
the addition of cystine, its utilization could be raised above 95 per
cent.
PROTEINS IN THE DIET—MITCHELL 227

When fed at a level of 8 to 10 per cent, thus permitting a more
or less rapid growth, the proteins of the feeds examined arrange
themselves in the following order:

Even at this level the differences in nutritive value of proteins do
not seem to be extreme, if the proteins of the navy bean and of the
packing house by-product known as tankage are disregarded. The
differences among the biological values of these 13 protein mix-
tures are no wider than differences in their digestibility. ‘The
rather distinct drop in the value of beef proteins between the 8 and
10 per cent level, we can not explain. Our work with veal seems
to indicate a slight superiority of its proteins over those of beet,
beth for maintenance and growth. We are at present extending
this study to the proteins of pork and mutton. Results on two rats
with rice proteins at a level of 8 per cent, for two seven-day periods
each, consistently indicated a utilization of 85, but until further work
has been done on this cereal, we do not feel sufficient confidence in
this figure to include it with the others in the table. Unfortunately
no tests have been made upon the proteins of wheat as yet, though
experiments are now under way to supply this deficiency.

The experimental work just reviewed indicates rather definitely
the superiority of meat and milk proteins over vegetable proteins.
However, the differences between the two class of proteins are not so
great as to constitute a weighty argument favoring animal foods,
nor, with few exceptions, are the differences between the vegetable
proteins studied of any great moment. The tendency of this in-
vestigation, and of others of recent date, is to minimize the dif-
ferences existing among the protein values of the staple foods of tha
American diet. However, the biological value of the proteins of
the milled flours in promoting growth is undoubtedly distinctly
lower than that of the entire grains.

An extensive investigation of the biological values of the proteins
of foods has recently been published by McCollum and associates
(11), using a method worked out at Johns Hopkins University. In
this investigation the food studied was fed in a ration satisfactory
in respect to all food factors known, except for a possible deficiency
of protein, which was entirely supplied by the food in question.
228 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

The protein concentration of the rations was presumably sub-
optimal in all cases, so that, except for protein mixtures of good
quality, the growth curve of the rats, serving as experimental sub-
jects, was submaximal. ‘Thus, the extent of retardation of growth
was taken as an index to the extent to which the quality of any
mixture of proteins fell below that of the best combinations previ-
ously discovered. This information was supplemented by observa-
tions of the animals throughout their reproductive period relative
to fertility, infant mortality, and the appearance of senility, as
weil as observations of successive generations on the same diet. These
observations on the maternal functions figured largely in the final
judgment of the relative values of the proteins studied.

According to these experiments, the foods studied arrange them-
selves in decreasing order of the biological value of their proteins
according to the following scheme: (1) Beef kidney; (2) wheat;
(3) milk, beef liver; (4) beef muscle, barley, rye; (5) corn, oats;
(6) soy beans, navy beans, peas.

It will be observed that the proteins of wheat are assigned a higher
value than the proteins of milk or of meat, while the proteins of
barley and rye are placed on a par with the proteins of meat. These
relations are quite contrary to those indicated by other less compre-
hensive methods of research. One naturally raises the question
whether the method used by McCollum is entirely equivalent to the
methods previously used. To us there is little doubt but that
simple growth experiments and nitrogen balance studies, conducted
under proper conditions, can give reliable information of the
chemical adequacy of proteins for the purposes of maintenance and
of growth. To account for failures in the proper performance of
the maternal functions, and for nutritive failures in the second and
third generations, by reference solely to the source of protein in
the diet, no matter how complete the diet may seem to be in other
factors, is, we believe, equivalent to assuming that our present knowl-
edge of nutritive requirements is complete. I doubt whether such
an assumption is entirely justified. The more favorable results ob-
tained with the wheat ration than with the milk or meat rations,
may be related to the amount of food consumed rather than to its
composition.

The measurements of the biological values of proteins may be
combined with the measurements of protein digestibility to give
what may be called the “net” protein content of a food. For ex-
ample, if a cut of beef contains 20 per cent of protein of which 95
per cent is digestible, it would contain 19 per cent of digestible pro-
tein. Now if only 80 per cent of the digestible protein could be
PROTEINS IN THE DIET—MITCHELL 229

used to cover the protein requirements of the body, at ordinary
levels of protein intake, then the meat could be said to contain 19
.80=15.2 per cent of “net protein.” Similarly with corn contain-
ing 10 per cent of protein, of which 85 per cent is digestible, 58
per cent of the digestible protein being utilizable for structural
purposes, the “net protein” content would be 10.85x.58=4.93
per cent. Navy beans with 22 per cent of protein, of which 80
per cent is digestible, and of the latter only 38 per cent is available
for the repair and growth of the protein tissues, would contain
only 6.69 per cent of net protein. Navy beans, therefore, are not
as valuable a source of protein as their high content in this nutrient
would lead one to expect.

Unfortunately, in the balancing of dietaries, the protein factor
can not be so simply assessed, because of the supplementary action
of one protein upon another. The value of a protein in the diet
depends not only upon its own inherent value, but upon its ability
to enhance the value of other proteins. Several proteins have been
shown to possess the property of correcting the chemical deficiencies
of other proteins, so that a mixture of two proteins may have a
greater biological value than the mean value of the proteins them-
selves. As an illustration of this supplementing effect of proteins,
we may cite an experiment on corn proteins, skim’ milk proteins,
and a mixture of the two in the proportion of 3 of corn protein to
1 of milk protein. The average biological value of the corn pro-
tein was 61, of the milk proteins 84, and of the mixture, 75, all
rations containing 10 per cent of protein. Now the weighted mean
of the values for corn and milk in the ratio of 3 to 1 is 67. The
difference between the mean value, 67, and the value actually ob-
tained, 75, represents the supplementing action of the milk proteins.
A more striking instance yet is afforded by a mixture of corn pro-
teins and tankage proteins. Alone, these proteins were found to
have values of 61 and 33, respectively. Fed in the proportion of
3 to 1, the mixture was found to have a value of 65, higher than
that for corn proteins alone.

Recent work indicates that while vegetable proteins do not in
general supplement each other effectively, the proteins of milk,
meat, and eggs do exhibit marked supplementary properties, thus
giving to animal foods a twofold importance in dietetics. When
it is considered in this connection that on the average some 48 per
cent of the protein of the American diet is derived from milled
cereals, and almost 9 per cent from legumes, making 52 per cent
of proteins of exceptionally low biological value for growth, the
importance of animal proteins in the diet is obvious, particularly
230 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 19238

for children and convalescents. It is perhaps no exaggeration to
say that the importance of animal proteins in the diet resides as
much in their capacity of supplementing cereal and legume proteins
as in their own excellence.

As mentioned above, our nitrogen balance data indicate a better
utilization of protein the lower the level at which it is fed, until at
the maintenance level proteins, with few exceptions, are all well
utilized. Confirmation of this view may be found in the work of
Osborne and Mendel. A practical corollary following from this
statement is that with adult animals, to which high protein diets
are not essential, the kind of protein consumed would seem to be
largely a matter of indifference. For men, the protein minimum is
something like 30 grams per day for a man of average weight.
Such a man consumes, however, close to 100 grams of protein per
day, so that even though the digestibility and the quality of the
dietary protein were relatively poor, there would be little danger of
a protein deficiency if the values given above are correct. If the
man were consuming even much less protein than 100 grams, there
would be a tendency for the smaller amounts to be digested more
completely and subsequently utilized more completely in metabolism,
so that here also the danger of a protein deficiency would seem to
be remote. The theory that pellagra is a disease involving pri-
marily a deficiency of protein, therefore, finds no support from
such considerations. These statements assume, of course, that the
satisfaction of protein requirements is simply a matter involving
the chemical adequacy of the dietary proteins and the amount
consumed.

Obviously, with growing children and nursing mothers, the qual-
ity and quantity of protein consumed is a matter of far greater
moment, and until reliable information as to protein requirements
in such cases is at hand, the safe procedure would be to provide
liberally with proteins of good quality and of good supplementing
capacities. Such proteins are contained in milk, meat, fish, and
eggs. The presence of these foods in the diet will permit the use
of considerable amounts of other foods whose proteins are poor in
quality and low in concentration, without reducing the net value of
the mixed proteins of the diet to the danger point. The legumes,
with the exception of soy beans, while high in protein, are not suit-
able foods for this purpose, on account of the relatively low value
of their proteins, both as regards digestibility and subsequent utiliza-
tion. With beans, again excepting the soy bean, the amino acid
cystine seems to be the factor limiting the biological value. One
would expect, therefore, that meat proteins or egg proteins, com-
PROTEINS IN THE DIET—MITCHELL yop

paratively rich in sulphur, would supplement the proteins of beans
better than milk proteins, since casein, the main protein of milk, is
known to be very poor in respect to its content of cystine. Recently
the value of the proteins of nuts has been demonstrated (12). Their
high content of protein, of fairly high digestibility and apparently
of good biological value, should commend them as a good source of
dietary protein.

Any complete survey of the place of proteins in the diet must
include some consideration of the conclusion so frequently expressed,
that protein consumed in amounts much above the actual require-
ments of the body may exert harmful physiological effects. In sup-
port of this conclusion, reference is often made to the well-known
work of Chittenden on the low protein dietary. However, in these
classical experiments, the absence of control groups maintained upon
the usual level of protein renders questionable the deduction that the
observed benefits of the low protein dietaries adopted were due
solely, if at all, to the reduction in protein intake. In fact, the
recent success of McCollum in raising rats on diets containing as
high as 70 per cent of protein certainly is a strong argument against
ascribing to protein deleterious physiological effects when fed even
in great excess. Several instances in recorded human experience
may be cited to the same purpose. However, while it is probably
true that protein may be indulged in to great excess without any
immediate ill effects, or even with no pronounced ill effects at all,
the wisdom of so doing may be questioned. The comfort of an in-
dividual, as well as his mental and physical efficiency, are undoubt-
edly adversely affected under certain conditions by a high-protein
dietary. The degree and type of activity of the individual should
- be considered, and the protein intake graded in direct proportion to
the muscular activity. The well-known stimulating action of pro-
tein foods on metabolism probably is related to vitality and stamina,
and should be numbered among the favorable effects of protein as
a nutrient. At the same time the pronounced heating effect of pro-
tein, associated with its stimulating action on metabolism, will
naturally and rightly lead to a seasonal variation in the popularity
of protein-rich foods.

This abbreviated consideration of the importance of protein in
the dietary, involving a study of the waste incidental to its utiliza-
tion by the body, its proper function in the body, and its physiologi-
cal effects, illustrates how complicated the problem of protein re-
quirements has become and how difficult it is to make hard and fast
recommendations. In pedagogy the subject of protein requirements
is still the despair of the teacher of the physiology of nutrition.

THE STORY OF THE PRODUCTION AND USES OF
DUCTILE TANTALUM?

By CLARENCE W. BALKE
Fansteel Products Co. (Inc.)

In the year 1801, Hatchett discovered the oxide of a new metal in
a black mineral which he obtained from the British Museum. He
named the metal columbium and the mineral columbite, because the
mineral originally came from Massachusetts. A year later Eckeberg
made a similar discovery while working with some new minerals from
Sweden, and he named the new metal which he discovered tantalum.
Subsequently, a number of other investigators announced the discov-
ery of new metals in tantalum- and columbium-bearing ores which
were all shown to be mixtures of these two, and in 1866 Marignac de-
veloped his classical method for their separation, which depends upon
the difference in solubility of their double fluorides with potassium.

The first mention of tantalum in the metallic form is that obtained
by Berzelius. In 1824 he obtained a very impure product, containing
not over 60 per cent of metal and having a specific gravity of 10,
by reducing potassium tantalum fluoride with potassium. In 1902,
Moissan produced a very hard and brittle form of tantalum high
in carbon and having a specific gravity of about 12.8. In 1903, Dr.
W. von Bolton, working in Germany, developed a process for the pro-
duction of tantalum of sufficient purity to make it possible to produce
drawn filament wire for incandescent lamps, and during the years
1905 to 1911 probably over 100,000,000 of these lamps were produced.
This material as a filament wire was then replaced by tungsten.

About 20 years ago the writer became interested in these elements and
devoted a number of years to the study of their various compounds
and to the determination of their atomic weights. More recently, be-
lieving in the commercial value of this metal, an investigation was
befun with the idea of producing the metal in commercial quantities.
During the present year this investigation was brought to a successful
conclusion, and it is now possible to produce tantalum characterized
by high purity and capable of being worked into sheet, rod, or wire.

OCCURRENCE OF TANTALUM

The elements tantalum and columbium are usually found associated
with each other in their ores. The most important minerals contain-
ing these elements are columbite and tantalite, which are really

stitute of Chemical Engineers, Dec. 6—9, 1922. Reprinted by permission from Chemical

iron salts of columbic and tantalic acids. Usually a part of the iron
is replaced by manganese, and small amounts of titanium, tin, and
tungsten are almost always present. To lesser extent it occurs with
rare earths in samarskite and other minerals. ‘

For the production of metallic tantalum, tantalite is the most
desirable ore and should contain at least 60 per cent of the oxide
and only a few per cent of columbium oxide.

The first step involved in the production of metallic tantalum is the
extraction of pure compounds of tantalum from the mineral tantalite.
This involves the separation of the columbium which may be present.

There are a number of methods available with which to attack
this ore. As the most suitable method for the separation of tantalum
from columbium is through the difference in solubility of the potas-
sium double fluorides, the method employed should be directed to-
ward the easiest method of: production of these compounds. The
pulverized ore may be fused with potassium bisulphate. On leach-
ing this fusion, the acids of tantalum and columbium remain insolu-
ble and can be dissolved in hydrofluoric acid and treated with potas-
sium fluoride, or the mineral may be fused with acid ammonium
fluoride and the tantalum precipitated from the solution of the melt
by means of potassium fluoride.

A method which is more easily carried out on a large scale is the
fusion of the finely pulverized ore with potassium hydroxide, which
converts the tantalum and columbium into soluble columbates and
tantalates. The filtered solution containing these salts may be
treated with a mineral acid, preferably nitric or sulphuric acid,
which precipitates the insoluble acids of tantalum and columbium.
After washing, these are dissolved in hydrofluoric acid and the solu-
tion is treated with sufficient potassium fluoride to produce the
double fluorides K,TaF, and K,CbOF;H,O. These two salts are
readily separated by crystallization, inasmuch as the columbium salt
is about 12 times as soluble as the tantalum double fluoride.

The oxide of tantalum can be produced from this double fluoride
by treating the solution of the salt with ammonia, and precipitating
the acid, which can be washed and then ignited to oxide.

PRODUCTION OF METALLIC TANTALUM

It is perfectly evident at the present time that the early attempts
to produce metallic tantalum, involving such methods as the reduc-
tion of the oxide with carbon in an electric furnace, the reduction
of tantalum oxide with aluminum by the Thermit process, or the
reduction of the oxide by means of misch metal (mixed cerium earth
metal), could not have given a product characterized by any degree
of purity, and most certainly a metal which could not be subjected
to any mechanical working.
TANTALUM—BALKE Dib

Metallic tantalum powder can be produced by the reduction of the
double fluoride with metallic sodium or potassium. It is impossible
by this process to produce a powder characterized by high purity.
For best results by this method the reaction should be carried out
in a vacuum, the boats or crucibles containing the mixture of
double fluoride and metallic sodium or potassium being placed in
a tube or furnace which can be evacuated before the mixture is raised
to the reaction temperature.

The product from this reaction can be treated with water and
mineral acids in order to free the metal powder as completely as
possible from adhering salt and other impurities. This powder is
then compressed into bars and subjected to heat treatment and
_ finally fusion in a vacuum furnace, the high temperature of fusion
eliminating the impurities which may be present. If this process
has been completely successful, the fused metal will be found to be
ductile and susceptible to mechanical working.

The most characteristic chemical property of tantalum is its un-
usual resistance to chemical corrosion. It is not attacked by hydro-
chloric or nitric acids or by aqua regia, either hot or cold. It is not
attacked by dilute sulphuric acid at ordinary or more elevated tem-
peratures, but appears to be slowly attacked by boiling concentrated
sulphuric acid. Solutions of caustic alkalis do not attack the metal.
Hydrofluoric acid seems to be the only chemical agent which will
attack it, and in the case of very pure metal and very pure hydro-
fluoric acid the action is very slow. A mixture of hydrofluoric and
nitric acids will attack the metal with avidity, causing it to go into
solution as tantalum fluoride.

If tantalum is heated in the air, the surface becomes blue at a
temperature of about 400° C., and at a somewhat higher temperature
nearly black. Above a dull red heat the white oxide is produced and
the metal gradually burns. This metal combines with avidity
with hydrogen, oxygen, or nitrogen. It will take up seven hundred
and forty times its own volume of hydrogen, producing a very coarse-
grained brittle product.

Tantalum containing dissolved gases will be harder than the pure
metal, and if their quantity is appreciable the metal may even be
brittle, so that all annealing or heating operations with tantalum
must be carried out in a vacuum. Tantalum burns readily when
heated in chlorine gas, producing the volatile pentachloride. Solu-
tions of chlorine, however, are without any action on the metal.
Tantalum is not affected by any of the chemicals or antiseptics used
in dentistry or surgery, probably without exception.

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF TANTALUM

It has been possible to produce metallic tantalum of an exceedingly
high degree of purity, and to produce it in commercial quantities,
236 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

having a purity of at least 99.5. The pure worked material resem-
bles platinum very much in color and appearance. Its melting point
may at present be taken as 2,850° C. The specific gravity of the
worked metal is 16.6. The pure metal is characterized by toughness
and by its great ductility and malleability.

It has been found possible to reduce a bar of tantalum about three-
eighths inch in diameter to wire of only a few mils in diameter
without any intermediate heating to the annealing or equiaxing
temperature, although the material is subject to strain hardening, re-
sembling the more common metals such as silver or copper in this
respect. Tantalum, however, resembles tungsten and molybdenum
in that they may all be worked severely at temperatures below their
equiaxing temperatures. Copper and silver may be worked at room
temperature, but these metals become quite rapidly strain-hardened
so that a further reduction makes it necessary to anneal the metal.
Tungsten and molybdenum must be worked at elevated temperatures
in the early stages, and if they are to be worked at room tempera-_
ture in the finer sizes any operation corresponding to ordinary an-
nealing must be avoided. Tantalum may be worked at room tem-
perature to a remarkable extent without annealing.

The tensile strength of drawn tantalum wire may reach 130,000
pounds, which is considerably more than that of hard drawn copper,
nickel, or platinum, but less than that of molybdenum or tungsten.

The linear coefficient of expansion is more than that of molybde-
num or tungsten and only slightly less than platinum. For this
reason it is possible to seal tantalum into glass.

The electrical resistance is quite high, about eight times that of
copper and about three time that of tungsten. The accompanying
table gives the physical properties of tantalum as far as they are
at present known, and also those of a number of other metals in com-
parison.

HIGH CHEMICAL RESISTIVITY GIVES IT MANY USES

In considering the possible uses for this metal we must take into
account its high melting point, its resistance to chemical corrosion,
and its tendency to absorb all of the common gases. We must also
remember that we are limited by its relatively low temperature of
oxidation. Tantalum seems to be a very desirable metal for the
manufacture of certain dental instruments and dental spatulas, and
undoubtedly for other dental and surgical tools or instruments. The
metal is not attacked by any of the antiseptics or chemicals used
and can be readily sterilized by heat. A surface film of hard ma-
terial about as hard as agate can be produced on the metal by proper
heat treatment. It will probably be found possible to harden the
material throughout, thus combining all the advantages of tem-
pered steel with absolute chemical inertness.

It has been suggested for use in the manufacture of pens and
analytical weights. Its use in chemical laboratories and in the
chemical industries as containers, parts of pumps, and other equip-
ment will undoubtedly depend upon the cost at which the metal can
ultimately be produced.

Tantalum is suitable for cathodes in electrochemical analysis. In
some respects it is more suitable than platinum. For instance, zinc
may be plated directly upon the tantalum, as it does not alloy with
the metal. Gold or platinum can be deposited upon the metal, as
they can be removed by aqua regia without attacking the electrode.

Undoubtedly tantalum in the form of sheet, wire, or ribbon will
find application in the manufacture of radio sending and receiving
tubes. The property of tantalum of absorbing gases would seem
to make the metal its own “ getter ” in vacuum tubes, and would tend
to maintain the high vacuum required, particularly in the sending
tubes. It would seem that some part of the lamp made of tantalum
could be so constructed that at all times a portion of the metal
would be at the proper temperature to absorb gas and would, there-
fore, tend to maintain a vacuum equilibrium within the bulb.

USE OF TANTALUM AS AN ELECTROLYTIC VALVE

Tantalum has interesting possibilities on account of its property
of acting as an electrolytic valve.

If two plates of bright tantalum metal are placed in an electro-
lyte and the two plates connected to an electric battery, there is an
938 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

instantaneous flow of current similar to that between plates of the
better known metals. Within a few seconds the current flow will
drop to a very small comparative value, providing the battery volt-
age is not too high. The order of the current flow will become that
of 1 milliampere and less with impressed direct current voltage up to
75 volts, when sulphuric acid of the strength ordinarily used for stor-
age batteries is the electrolyte. This drop in current flow will be
accompanied by the formation of a film on the tantalum anode, pre-
sumably of tantalum oxide. This film often shows beautiful irides-
cent colors.

Tf a tantalum plate and a lead plate are placed in an electrolyte and
a source of alternating current of the usual commercial frequency is
connected to the tantalum and lead plates, the current flow in one
direction will be almost entirely shut off and a pulsating direct cur-
rent will be obtained. In such a set-up this flow of current is ac-
companied by electrolytic action with evolution of hydrogen gas at
the tantalum and oxygen at the lead. The action of the tantalum
is, therefore, such that electrons are permitted to flow from the tan-
talum to release hydrogen ions but are prevented from passing from
oxygen ions into the tantalum.

The current derived from this apparatus may be utilized for charg-
ing storage batteries, for the electro-deposition of metals, and vari-
ous other electrochemical actions requiring a direct current.

It is possible, by using two tantalum electrodes in a single cell,
so to rectify the current that both half waves of alternating current
pass in the same direction. This current may be smoothed out by
a suitable series of inductances and capacities to give what is prac-
tically a constant direct current.

The efficiency of tantalum as a valve with respect to leakage of the
current varies with the impressed voltage, with the electrolyte, cur-
rent density, etc. Due to the fact that tantalum is very inert toward
the chemical action of solutions, there is a wide choice of electrolytes
and the life of the tantalum appears practically unlimited.

For a charging set-up with a 6 to 8 volt battery the energy effi-
ciency is approximately 3314 per cent, which compares favorably
with rectifiers of the hot and cold electrode type and the mechanically
vibrating rectifiers.

The tantalum battery charging rectifier is noiseless in operation,
has no moving parts, and requires attention in only one matter, which
it has in common with the storage battery itself—that of distilled
water being added to replace evaporated and decomposed water of
the electrolyte.

In addition to functioning directly as a rectifier for obtaining con-
tinuous current, apparatus built along similar principles may be

—_— see
TANTALUM—BALKE 239

used for electrolytic condensers and electrolytic detectors and pos-
sibly lightning arresters.

Among other metals which have this property of valve action
more or less in common with tantalum are magnesium and aluminum.
However, owing to the ready susceptibility of both these metals to
chemical corrosion, they have not proved very suitable as sources
of direct current. Condensers and lightning arresters for high po-
tential transmission lines are commercially used with aluminum
plates.

THE COMPOSITION OF THE EARTH’S INTERIOR’

By L. H. ApAms and HE. D. WILLIAMSON
Geophysical Laboratory, Carnegie Institution of Washington

Curiosity is one of the dominant characteristics of man. From
early childhood he seems impelled to examine every object within
his reach and when possible to open it up to see what makes the
wheels go ’round. But the urge which led Pandora so deeply
into trouble is, in another aspect, called science, and provides the
mainspring for the procurement and classification of facts. Scien-
tific investigation is merely a manifestation of curiosity concerning
those things which we see or know about but do not understand.

It is only natural that the internal constitution of the globe
upon which we live should excite our curiosity. Although the
diameter of the earth is 8,000 miles, the deepest borings have pene-
trated down to a depth of little more than 1 mile; it is as if a sphere
the size of an orange were inhabited by diminutive beings who
had explored their globe only at the surface and to a depth of
one-fourth the thickness of the paper on which these words are
written. The inaccessibility of the earth’s interior, and the appar-
ently insuperable difficulties which are presented, only serve to
sharpen our zeal for finding out something about it. Nowadays we
are becoming more accustomed to investigate things which can
not be seen, and in this paper it is hoped to show what can be
learned of the earth’s interior, even though it be beyond the reach
of direct observation.

The principal sources of information concerning the interior of
the earth are as follows: (1) The constant of gravitation, from
which the total mass and average density of the earth are deter-
mined; (2) the constant of precession and other astronomic and
geodetic data from which the moments of inertia of the earth may
be calculated, the moment of inertia allowing important inferences
to be drawn concerning the density distribution within the earth;
(3) the known flattening of the earth, as determined from the
data of geodesy, with which any assumed distribution of mate-

rearrangement and with minor additions.

241
242 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

rials must harmonize; and (4) seismologic data from which the
elastic constants of the materials in the interior may be computed.
These facts, together with the elastic constants of various rocks as
measured by the authors,? provide the basis for the present estimate
of the density and composition of the earth at various depths.

The bearing of the above classes of data on the constitution of
the earth’s interior will first be discussed briefly.

MEAN DENSITY OF THE EARTH

The constant of gravitation from direct experimental observation
is known to be 6.66 X10—® cm/g.-sec.?._ This fixes the average density
of the earth at 5.52; that is, the earth is five and one-half times as
heavy as an equal bulk of water. This fact alone allows certain
qualitative inferences to be drawn concerning the interior. The
average density of the surface rocks is about 2.7 and no ordinary
rock has a dénsity much above 8; therefore in all probability the
density near the center must be considerably higher than 5.5 in order
that the average density of the whole earth may have the correct
value. The precise manner in which the density varies with depth
and the magnitude of the central density are questions which long ago
attracted the attention of geophysicists. Several empirical laws have
been proposed for representing the density at a given distance from
the center of the Earth. Among the best known are those of
Laplace * and of Roche,‘ either of which, with an assumed surface
density 2.7, indicates that the central density is somewhat above 10.
These empirical “ laws,” of course, can not be expected to give a true
representation of density in the interior; the supposed continuity of
density change from the surface to the center, and the magnitudes
of the densities at various depths, rest upon insecure hypotheses.
Yet it is an interesting circumstance that either law, as will be
shown later, affords a rough qualitative indication of the earth’s
density at various depths.

The high density at the center obviously may be due either to the
presence of heavier material, presumably iron or nickel-iron, or to
a diminution of volume by the tremendous pressure existing at
great depths—or both factors may enter. It has often been as-
sumed that the increase of density with depth is merely the result
of the compressibility of the homogenous material. If this were true,
Laplace’s law, for example, could be used to calculate the compressi-

x in which p is the density at
any distance r from the center, po is the central density, and g is a constant determined by the known total
mass of the earth. ba

‘ The law of Roche is p=po (1—kr?), in which k is a constant which also can be determined from the earth’s
total mass or mean density.

3 Laplace’s equation, also derived independently by Legendre, is p=po

EARTH’S INTERIOR—-ADAMS AND WILLIAMSON 243

bility of the earth at the surface and in the interior, and there would
be no need to postulate a heavy material at the center, the earth, on
this basis, consisting throughout of silicate rock like that found at
the surface. There is no a priori reason why this could not be so,
but clearly other lines of evidence must be examined before an
answer to this question can be secured.

MOMENT OF INERTIA OF THE EARTH

It is obvious that for a given mass (or for a given mean density)
the moment of inertia depends on the distribution of density *; e. g.,
if there is heavy material at the center and light material at the
surface the moment of inertia would be considerably less than if the
central density were smaller than that of the surface.

It is interesting in this connection to recall the old puzzle “ How to
distinguish between two hollow shells, one of gold, the other of silver,
if their diameters and masses be alike, and both pairited.”* Since
gold is denser than silver, the volume of the gold shell is less than
that of the silver shell, and therefore, on the whole, its mass is
farther from the center and its moment of inertia greater. Hence
to decide which is the gold and which the silver sphere, it suffices
to compare their moments of inertia. This may be done by allowing
them to roll down a rough plane, whereupon the gold sphere will
move at the slower speed. In an analogous manner, the moment of
inertia of the earth may be used to decide which of two proposed
distributions of matter within the earth is the more plausible. The
moment of inertia itself is not sufficient to fix the density distribu-
tion; it can be used, however, as an important check on a density
curve deduced from other considerations. The moment of inertia of
the earth about the polar axis is known to be close to 8.0610"
g.-cm?. Since the moment about the equatorial axis differs from
that about the polar axis by only one-third of 1 per cent, very little
error is introduced by dealing with a sphere of radius equal to the
mean radius of the earth and having a moment of inertia equal to the
value just mentioned.

The moment of inertia of the earth if of uniform density from
surface to center would be 9.710“, significantly higher than the true
value. In other terms, the moment of inertia of the earth is that
of a homogeneous sphere of density 4.6. From this fact, also, fol-
lows the qualitative conclusion that in general the density must in-

in which p is the density at distance r from the center. For a homogeneous sphere this becomes

244 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

crease toward the center, in harmony with the inference already
drawn from the high density of the earth as a whole.

THE ELLIPTICITY OF THE EARTH

‘I'he earth, as is well known, is not a true sphere, but is flattened at
{he poles, approximating very closely to an ellipsoid of revolution.
The ellipticity, or flattening, is about 1/297; that is, the polar diame-
ter is 1/297 less than the equatorial diameter. Now the amount of
of this flattening depends upon the way in which the density varies
within the earth. Thus, if the earth were of uniform density the
flattening would be 1/232. But although it might seem that the
flattening would provide an independent means for determining the
density distribution within the earth, it so happens that a distribu-
tion which will satisfy the moments of inertia about the two axes
will yield almost exactly the right value for the ellipticity.’

TRANSMISSION OF EARTHQUAKE WAVES

Perhaps the most useful source of information concerning the
earth’s interior is furnished by the velocities with which earthquake
shocks are transmitted through the earth. It has been shown from
the theory of elasticity that any disturbance in a sphere of elastic
isotropic material should give rise to various kinds of waves travel-
ing with velocities depending only on the density and elastic con-
stants of the material at each point. Waves of two of these kinds
would pass through the sphere, while the others, which are less
simple to analyze, would travel over the surface. A seismograph
recording the time of arrival of the various waves at some other
point would show the arrival first of the two waves passing through
the earth and later that of the various surface ones. One of the
“through waves” consists of transverse vibrations, while the other
consists of longitudinal vibrations and travels with a higher ve-
locity.« These through waves should theoretically be easily dis-
tinguished from the surface waves by the circumstance that their
apparent velocity (i. e., the velocity obtained by comparing their
times of arrival at various points on the surface with the corre-
ponding distances from the origin) should vary with the distance,
whereas the velocity of the surface waves should be constant. The
records of earthquakes as obtained by sensitive seismographs reveal
these expected features, and we may with considerable confidence
use the theoretical relations between velocities and elastic constants
to calculate the rigidity and the compressibility of the material

8The velocities of the transverse and longitudinal waves are respectively: Vs=VRip and Ve=

far within the earth. The data obtained from seismograms, more-
over, indicate that the material of the earth, except at the surface,
may be treated as (megascopically) isotropic. It is fortunate that
this is the case, since otherwise the mathematical treatment of seismo-
logic data would be extremely difficult.

Starting from the time-distance curve—that is, the times of arrival
of a disturbance at given distances along the surface—by a compara-
tively simple process one can calculate the elastic constants of the
material of the earth at various depths. The steps in the process are
as follows: (a) From the slopes of the time-distance curves the

and by Knott.'* The velocity of both kinds of waves increases rap-
idly at first, and then steadily and almost linearly until a depth of
1,600 km. is reached, after which the velocity, although nearly con-
stant, shows a tendency to fall off, especially at about 3,000 km. As
will be shown below, when the density at various depths is known,
these curves can be converted into compressibility-depth and rigidity-

We shall next use the above results to determine to what extent
the higher density of the interior of the earth may be due to com-
pression alone. The decrease in volume caused by pressure at great
depths can not be calculated from the measured compressibility of
rocks, even if the pressure were known, because the compressibility
decreases with the pressure, which at a depth of only a few hundred
kilometers is far beyond the range of laboratory measurement, But
fortunately, the velocity of transmission of earthquake waves yields
information as to the variation of compressibility (1/4) with depth.
The values of H/p at various depths have been calculated from the
earthquake velocities (see footnote on p. 245), and the results shown
in column 4 of Table 1. Now, it is reasonable to suppose that from
this information concerning compressibility it would be possible to
determine the aggregate diminution in volume at a given depth
on the supposition of a homogeneous earth whose central density
is made high by compression and not by a change of composition.
An equation connecting these quantities has been derived,* and used

18 The equation is derived as follows:

In general,

where g is the acceleration of gravity and p is the pressure at distance r from the center; and m, the
mass of the sphere of radius r, is obtained from the relation

The density-depth relation is obtained from this equation by approximation and re-
peated graphical integration. First, the density at various levels is assumed (consistent,
of course, with the known average density of the earth). The quantity, p 17, is then
plotted against r, and m found by graphical integration of equation A. Next, the quan-
tity, mp/rkK, is plotted against r, and pas a function of r determined according to equa-
tion B by another graphical integration. This first approximation for p is used to
calculate a new curve for m, which in turn yields a second approximation for p. It

turns out that the convergence is very rapid, so that with almost any initially assumed
values of the density three successive integrations are sufficient.

to calculate the increase of density with the earth due to compres-
sion alone. In the calculation of density changes by this equation
the principal uncertainty lies in the choice of the surface density.

Table 1 shows the first step of such a calculation, the initially as-
sumed values of ¢ being those given by Laplace’s law, with a surface
density 3. From this first step alone it is evident that Laplace’s dis-
tribution of density is impossible if the condition of homogeneity
were fulfilled. In other words, the density according to Laplace in-
creases faster than can be accounted for by compression alone.

The final density curves for two different assumed surface densities
(3 and 3.5) are shown in Figure 2. The proper value to take for
the initial density (i. e., for the effective surface density) is difficult
to determine. It has been placed all the way from 2.7 to 3.7 by vari-
ous investigators. It is generally agreed that although the average
density of surface rocks is from 2.7 to 2.8, corresponding to granite
or granodiorite, nevertheless the granitic layer is relatively few miles
deep (say 5 to 20); and that underneath this very thin skin of grani-
tic (and sedimentary) rocks lies a more basic material such as gab-
bro or even pyroxenite or peridotite.

For the moment it will be sufficient to note in figure 2 the density
curves with two initial densities, 8 and 3.5, corresponding respectively
to average gabbro and to dense peridotite. Although the calculation
was carried only to a depth of 3,400 km., this limit being set by the
seismologic data, it is clearly evident that the density is not increas-
ing fast enough to make the mean density of the earth equal to 5.5.
248 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

For the two assumed surface densities the average density below
3,400 km. would be 15 and 20, respectively—obviously much too
high to be reached by any reasonable extrapolation of the density
curves. The high central density demanded by the comparatively
low density shown in Figure 2 may be considered a consequence of
the fact that the core of radius 3,000 km., has only one-ninth of the
volume of the earth, whereas 0.3 to 0.4 of the mass remains to be
accounted for.

It is therefore zmpossible to explain the high density of the earth
on the basis of compressibility alone. The dense interior can not

due to compression alone. The values are obtained from the variation of compressi-
bility, which in turn is determined from the earthquake velocity-depth curve

consist of ordinary rocks compressed to a small volume. We must,
as a consequence, fall back upon the only reasonable alternative,
namely, the presence of a heavier material, presumably some metal,
which, to judge from its abundance in the earth’s crust, in
meteorites, and in the sun, is probably iron. We thus arrive at the
conclusion accepted by the majority of geophysicists, but, in addi-
tion, we have here (1) a quantitative estimate of the increase of
density due to compression alone, and (2) direct evidence of the
presence in the interior of the earth of a dense material such as iron.

THE ELASTIC CONSTANTS OF TYPICAL ROCKS

The elastic properties of a series of rock types are shown in Table
2, which is taken (with slight changes) from a previous paper by
the authors.1* The compressibilities are based on direct measure-
ments in the laboratory. From the compressibility is*calculated the
rigidity, and also the velocities with which earthquake waves are
transmitted through the given kind of rock.

EFFECT OF TEMPERATURE

This is a disturbing and uncertain factor. From the known tem-
perature gradient at the surface it follows that the temperature at
100 km. depth must be considerably above the melting point of
ordinary rocks; and it seems unlikely that the central temperature
can be less than several thousand degrees. The effect of this high
temperature.on the density is not easily estimated, and might con-
ceivably be very large, but it so happens that the problem is
simplified by the fact that at high pressures the expansion coefti-
cient becomes less than at low pressures. Now, the pressure halfway
down to the center of the earth is more than a million atmospheres,
and it is not at all improbable that at this pressure the total thermal
expansion and the effect of temperature on elastic constants would be
relatively small. For the present, at any rate, we shall ignore the
effect of temperature, but with the belief that it is a minor factor.

PREVIOUS THEORIES OF DENSITY DISTRIBUTION IN THE EARTH

Laplace’s distribution, already mentioned, should perhaps best be
regarded as an empirical relation connecting density with depth,
and should not be taken to imply anything concerning the cause of
the increased density. The law of Laplace has been criticized be-
cause it requires too low a surface density in order to yield the cor-
rect value for the moment of inertia. Darwin? suggested a differ-
ent density law with a surface density of 3.7. He held that the
ordinary rocks on the outside of the earth were a mere shell, to
be considered separately, and that the density immediately heneath
should be taken as the starting point.

The earlier pictures of the earth’s interior involved the tacit
assumption that the composition of the deeper parts was the same,
or practically the same, as at the surface. According to this view,
the earth was a huge ball of granite, chemically homogeneous,
although possibly molten at the center. But following what might
be called the granitic era of geophysics, the belief arose that the
center of the earth might be quite unlike the rocks which we find
at the surface and in our shallow excavations. More than 50 years
ago Dana?® discussed the possibility of the earth being made up
of a central iron core surrounded by silicate rock. Later,
Weichert 1? elaborated this hypothesis and postulated a core of
density 8.4 within a stony shell 1,500 km. thick and of density 3.4.
His arrangement *® fits both the mass and moment of inertia of
the earth very well, and the transition point from rock to metal at
1,500 km. is in fair agreement with the sudden change of direction
of the curve of earthquake velocities shown in Figure 1; but it
takes no account of the density due to compression, and fails to
explain why there should not be an actual discontinuity at the transi-
tion point. At moderate pressures.the velocity in basic rocks is
notably higher than in iron,’® and at very high pressures this differ-
ence will probably increase rather than decrease. Moreover, as may
be seen in Figure 1, the velocity beyond 1,600 km. changes very
little—contrary to what might be expected of a homogeneous mate-

18 Tt may be noted that on the assumption of a core and a shell each of uniform density
the radius and density of the core may be calculated from the known mass and moment
of inertia and an assumed outer density by the two equations:

Pa — pi = 23 (p1 — pa)

Pm — p2= 25 (p1 — 03)
in which pe is the mean density, pm is the density of a homogeneous sphere of moment
of inertia equal to that of the earth, 1 is the density of the core, p: that of the shell,
and @ the ratio of the radius of the core to that of the earth. Thus, if the density of the
outer layer is 3.00, its thickness must be 1,300 km. and the density of the core is 8.03;
and if the outer density is 3.40, the thickness of the shell would be 1,600 km. and the
central density 8.45.

252 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

rial under a constantly increasing pressure. It may be argued that
the effect of temperature in this region may decrease the elastic
constants and hence also the velocity. But on any hypothesis the
temperature is not increasing rapidly as far down as this, and it
seems highly improbable that increasing temperature would have
sufficient effect on both the rigidity and the bulk modulus so that
with increasing depth the two velocities would remain nearly con-
stant over a range of 1,400 km. The constancy of the velocities is
truly a remarkable feature and, as will appear below, furnishes an
important clue for the solution of the problem of the earth’s interior.
In recent times Goldschmidt ?° has postulated an arrangement of
the matter within the earth as follows: (1) An outer silicate layer
120 km. thick and of density 2.8; (2) a layer of dense silicates
(eclogite) extending to 1,200 km. depth with density varying from
3.6 to 4; (3) an intermediate zone of sulphides and oxides of density
5.6 and extending to 2,900 km.; and (4) a central core of nickel-
iron having a density about 8. The average density of this arrange-
ment is very close to the accepted value, and the moment of inertia,
although 3 per cent too low, can be considered in fair agreement.
Zoeppritz, Geiger, and Gutenberg,”* and Mohorovi¢ié,” and others,
have adduced evidence in favor of the existence of various shells
or layers in the earth, but the arrangement which most nearly
resembles that which we shall describe in the next section is that
given by Gutenberg ** in a paper which came to our attention after
our paper was written. He obtains a density-depth curve which,
like ours, consists of four parts. The starting point of his deriva-
tion is the assumption that the core is of constant density 2.3 times
that of the layer above it, which also is of constant density. He
concludes that the density of the layer extending from 60 km. to
1,200 km. depth varies from 314 at the top to 434 at the bottom. In
this respect his estimate of the density change within the earth is
strikingly like that which we shall now describe, although ours
is based on the change of density due to compressibility and involves
assumptions quite different from those of Gutenberg.

must increase with depth, although the increase is not neces-
sarily regular. Probably the outer 10 to 20 km. has the average com-
position of a granite or a granodiorite. From the seismographic rec-
ords of the Oppau explosion, Wrinch and Jeffreys” find the velocity
of the longitudinal waves to be 5.4 km./sec., and Mohorovi¢ié?* by
analysis of the records of near earthquakes concludes that the velocity
from the surface to a depth of 60 km. is nearly constant and equal to
5.8 km./sec. The data given in Table 2 enable us to use these observa-
tions to determine the composition of the outermost layer and to com-
pare it with the thin surface film accessible to direct examination.
Theoretically the surface velocity can be obtained from the initial
slope of the ordinary time-distance curve, but on account of the -
searcity of reliable observations for near earthquakes the extrapola-
tion of the surface velocity back to zero distance is unsatisfactory, and,
moreover, as emphasized by Wrinch and Jeffreys, the usual uncer-
tainty regarding the depth of focus would vitiate the results at short
distances. From Turner’s table the “surface” velocity of the longi-
. tudinal waves seems to be about 7.1 km./sec.—between the values for
pyroxenite (7) and for peridotite (7.2), and distinctly higher than
that for gabbro (6.9). According to Mohorovitié, the velocity of
the longitudinal waves suddenly changes from 5.8 to 7.9 km./sec.
at a depth of 60 km. From Table 2 it may be seen that the velocity
in granite is 5.6 km./sec. The seismologic data, therefore, although
none too satisfactory, seem clearly to indicate that the crust of the
earth is largely granitic in character, but that at a depth of 100 km.
or less, basic material becomes predominant.

We propose, somewhat arbitrarily, to take 60 km. for the thick-
ness of the layer in which the rocks change from acid to basic.
Whether or not the change is gradual is a question to be decided
at some future time. The lower limit of this layer may. or may not
be identical with the depth of isostatic compensation. From gravity
measurements in mountainous regions this depth is placed by
Bowie ”’ at 96 km., but from the data over the whole United States
he places it at 60 km. Washington,?* moreover, finds the average
density of various regions on the earth to harmonize with the aver-
age elevation on the basis of isostatic compensation at a depth of
59 km. In any case this layer has a volume of only a few per cent
of the total volume of the earth, and its thickness has little effect
on the density distribution of the earth as a whole. The basaltic
substratum, postulated by Daly, Wegener, and others, and of great

importance in interpreting the geology of the earth’s crust, is here
merely an incidental feature in the transition from granitic to ultra-
basic material.

BASIC LAYER

Referring again to Figure 1, one may note that the earthquake
velocity curves run regularly and almost linearly from near the sur-
face to about 1,600 km. depth. It is natural to assume that this
region then is a more or less homogeneous material, the bulk modulus
and rigidity of which increase regularly with pressure. From
reasons given below it is probable that the normal density (i. e.,
the density at low pressures) of this material is 3.3, which corre-
sponds to 3.35 at a depth of 60 km. The density at other depths may
be obtained by interpolation between the two curves of Figure 2.
Thus, at 1,600 km. depth the density has increased by compression
to 4.35. The normal density 3.3 corresponds to a pyroxenite or a
peridotite. Throughout this whole region the temperature must be
very high, and it is possible that a part of this layer is at a temper-
ature above its melting point, its high rigidity being maintained by
pressure.”® Both the density and the earthquake velocity will prob-
ably be somewhat smaller in such a glassy material than in a crystal-
line layer of the same composition, but the difference can hardly be
great enough to nullify the evidence in favor of an ultrabasic layer.

It has been suggested that meteorites should have the same average
composition as that of the earth or of any other part of the solar
system. Now this average composition *° (due account being taken
of the proportion in which stony and metallic meteorites are seen to
fall) corresponds to: Olivine, 35; pyroxene, 42; anorthite, 4;
troilite, 5; nickel-iron, 18. The silicate portion is principally an
olivine-pyroxene mixture and thus is essentially a peridotite, and
should have nearly the same density and compressibility as that
postulated for the basic layer.

PALLASITE LAYER

As already noted, a remarkable feature of the earthquake velocity
curves (fig. 1) is the small amount of change beyond a depth of
1,600 km. From compressibility measurements the velocity of the
longitudinal waves in iron at moderate pressures is 6.1 km./sec.,
whereas the velocity in peridotite is 7.2. At high pressures the
difference will probably be greater. This circumstance immediately
suggests that the nearly constant velocity below 1,600 km. may be

due to a gradually increasing amount of metallic iron mixed with
the siliceous rock. The normal tendency for pressure, and hence
depth, to increase the velocity is thus offset by the admixture, in
gradually increasing amount, of iron (or nickel-iron).

The material in this region may be thought of as resembling cer-
tain meteorites consisting of a heterogeneous mixture of silicates and
metallic iron, which is called pallasite. The lower limit of this zone
of incomplete segregation is thought to lie at about 3,000 km. depth
where the velocity shows distinct evidence of falling off.

CENTRAL METALLIC CORE

The remaining part of the earth consists, beyond reasonable doubt,
mainly of iron or nickel-iron with density appropriate to the con-
ditions of pressure (and of temperature) existing in the central
region. This density should increase toward the center, but by a
relatively small amount.

Now, if we assume (a) that the density in the surface layer
varies linearly with depth from 2.7 to some chosen density p, at the
top of the basic layer, (0) that in this basic layer the density change
can be calculated by interpolation between the two curves of figure
2, (c) that in the pallasite layer the density changes linearly with
depth (the simplest assumption), and (d@) that in the central core
the density changes parabolically,** the fact that the distribution
must satisfy the known mass and moment of inertia of the whole
earth allows us to solve two simultaneous equations and find the
density distribution in the pallasite layer and in the central core.
If this calculation be carried out for various values of p,, it is found
that p, must be close to 3.35 in order to yield a reasonable density
variation in the central core. The value 3.45 demands that in the
core the density decrease with depth. On the other hand, the value
3.25 leads to an unreasonably high density at the center. For this
reason the density at the top of the basic layer has been taken as
3.35, corresponding, as stated above, to a normal density 3.3 and to a
density 4.35 at 1,600 km. The density of the iron would then be
9.5 at 3,000 km. and 10.7 at the center.

These various considerations lead us to adopt more or less tenta-
tively, the following arrangement of material within the earth:
(1) An outer layer 60 km. (about 35 miles) thick ** in which the mate-

simplest assumption compatible with the necessary condition that the rate of change of
pressure with distance is zero at the center.

This applies more particularly.to continental areas. In the Atlantic Ocean, and
especially in the Pacific Ocean, the thickness of the outer layer is probably much less than
60 km,
256 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

rial changes more or less gradually from granitic to something more
basic than a gabbro; (2) a shell extending to a depth of 1,600 km.,
consisting of peridotite, that is, mainly of iron-magnesium silicates
and having a normal density 3.3 and a density at 1,600 km. of 4.35;
(3) a shell of pallasite reaching to 3,000 km. below the surface, in
_ which silicate rock is gradually replaced by metallic iron (or nickel-
iron) not yet completely segregated, the density in this shell chang-
ing gradually from 4.35 to 9.5; and (4) below this layer of pallasite
a central core of nickel-iron of nearly constant density—varying
from a little below to a little above 10. The existence of other lay-

Fie. 3.—The density of the earth at various depths according to the present estimate

ers or of other discontinuities is neither affirmed nor denied. The
proposed distribution of material merely attempts to harmonize
certain known facts regarding the mass and moment of inertia of
the earth, the velocities of earthquake waves, and the compressi-
bilities of rocks. It is put forth more as a basis for future specula-
tion than as a definite and final arrangement.

The distribution here described is shown graphically in Figure 3
(full-line curve). At the boundary between the various zones the
corners are arbitrarily slightly rounded. This diagram also con-
tains, for comparison, a plot of Goldschmidt’s distribution (dotted
lines), and the density according to Laplace’s law (dashed line)

EARTH’S INTERIOR—ADAMS AND WILLIAMSON 257

It is truly remarkable that Laplace’s equation, which can be re-
garded merely as an empirical relation, should yield values of the
density so close to those obtained in what we believe is a more ra-
tional way. The fact that Laplace’s law leads to the right moment
of inertia, of course, indicates that the densities obtained by it may
be correct to at least a rough approximation, and accounts for its
general use among geophysicists. The assumption involved in its
derivation is, however, by no means warranted.

COMPRESSIBILITY, RIGIDITY, AND BULK MODULUS

By combining the earthquake velocities given in Figure 1 with
the densities given in Figure 3, the elastic constants of the materia)
within the earth at various depths may readily be obtained.** The
values of the rigidity and bulk modulus have been calculated and are
shown graphically in Figure 5. It is very interesting that these
curves are comparatively smooth; they show no pronounced irregu-
larities or sudden changes of direction, such as are shown by the

258 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

density and velocity curves from which they are derived. This
means that from the surface to a depth at least halfway down to the
center the elasticity of the material increases regularly and steadily
in spite of the fact that the material changes in character, being
silicate rock near the surface and metallic iron farther down.

At great depths the bulk modulus is very great, and therefore the
compressibility, which is the reciprocal of the bulk modulus, is very
small. Thus at a depth of 1,600 km. the silicate is nearly as incom-
pressible as diamond, which is the least compressible of any known
substance.

reciprocal of the compressibility

The rigidity also is very high in the interior of the earth. From
the fact that the rigidity of steel is about 0.9 in the units used in
Figure 5, it may be seen that except near the surface the rigidity of
the earth is greater than that of steel. The rigidity is equal to 0.9
at about 400 km. depth and rises to five times this amount at 3,000
km. depth. Measurements*t based on the tidal deformation of
the earth indicate that the effective rigidity of the earth for such
deformations is 0.86, which according to Figure 5 is the average
rigidity of the outer 800 km., or 500 miles. If, then, it be the outer
800 km. which takes part in tidal deformations, the agreement be-
tween the two entirely different methods of determining rigidity
would be complete.

CONCLUDING REMARKS

_ In conclusion we refer to the following passage from the Annual
Report of the Director of the Geophysical Laboratory : **

Both science and story have left the interior of the earth virtually a closed
book. Imaginative writers have forecast many of the conquests of the sea
and of the air and of the regions beyond, but the interior of the earth remains
inaccessible to them; scientific effort has often been consciously and even
eagerly directed toward it, but has revealed scarcely more. The distance

from the surface to the center of the earth is some 4,000 miles, of which hardly
more than a mile has been actually explored. What properties or what sub-
stances even a few more miles might reveal is a matter for inference alone,
inference for the most part with a very inadequate if not an insecure founda-
tion of fact.

The physical properties and the chemical composition of the in-
terior of the earth are not yet amenable to precise measurement.
But, starting from recent determinations of the compressibility of
rocks, in conjunction with the known velocities at which earthquake
shocks are transmitted through the earth, it is possible to draw im-
portant conclusions concerning the nature of the material far within
the earth. For example, we can estimate the pressure at a given
depth, and we can tell approximately the amount by which the
density of rocks is raised by these enormous pressures. We know
definitely that rocks can not be squeezed into a volume so small that
their density would be sufficient to account for the high density of
the earth as a whole. Beyond reasonable doubt, the earth has a
metallic core of iron, or nickel-iron, the diameter of this core being
about one-half that of the earth. Bordering the iron core, more-
over, there is a fringe of mixed iron and silicate, and surrounding
this is a silicate shell. We can determine with fair accuracy the
rigidity of the material at a given depth within the earth, and can
assure ourselves that, except near the surface, the rigidity is con-
siderably greater than that of steel. Finally, as to chemical com-
position, the earth, except for the surface layer—which in compari-
son with the whole earth is of negligible volume—is composed mainly
of metallic iron and iron-magnesium silicates. Accordingly, the
earth consists almost entirely of four elements: Iron, magnesium,
silicon, and oxygen.
DIAMOND-BEARING PERIDOTITE IN PIKE COUNTY,
ARKANSAS?

By HucuH D. Miser and CLARENCE §. Ross
Geologists, United States Geological Survey

[With 3 plates]
INTRODUCTION

The diamond mines of Arkansas, which have produced several
thousand stones, are the only such mines on the North American
continent, though a few diamonds have been found from time to
time at other places in the United States and at some places in
Canada.

Most of the diamonds found in North America outside of Arkansas
have been obtained from gold placers in the Piedmont region of
the Carolinas and Georgia, from placers in the Western States, es-
pecially California, and from glacial deposits in regions as widely
separated as Nova Scotia and Wisconsin. All these stones were
found far from their sources, for placers are composed of stream-
transported material and glacial deposits consist of ice-transported
rock débris. The material in the placers has been carried from
rather well-known regions in which it seems unlikely that rich
diamond-bearing rocks occur. The diamonds found in these placers
were probably derived from dunite or serpentine, rocks that are
related to diamond-bearing peridotites but that contain very few
if any diamonds. The diamonds found in the glacial deposits, like
the granitic boulders, were carried from their parent ledges in
Canada by the continental glaciers that advanced southward into
the northern United States. It has therefore been surmised that the
rocks at some places in Canada might be rich in diamonds, but if
such a diamond deposit exists it is lost in the vast barren lands of
the North—more hoplessly lost than the most fanciful “lost gold
mine” of our own great West.

The diamond deposits of the world may be grouped into two
principal classes. Those in Brazil, India, and Australia and some
of those in Africa are in placers, where the stones have been more
or less concentrated by wind and water; but the largest deposits in

South Africa and those in Arkansas are in solid rock or in soft
residual material overlying it. All such rocks in both South Africa
and Arkansas belong to the variety known as peridotite, which in
both regions fills narrow volcanic craters and necks.

Peridotite contains comparatively small proportions of silica and
alumina but much magnesium and iron. It invariably contains the
mineral olivine, but usually includes a rather large proportion of
brown mica and small proportions of other minerals. It is the only
rock that is known to be the original source of paying quantities of
diamonds.

The peculiar type of diamond-bearing peridotite that occurs in
South Africa has been called kimberlite, after the famous Kimberley
mine. The diamond-bearing rock of Arkansas, which is similar, is
also known as kimberlite.

DISCOVERY

On August 1, 1906, John W. Huddleston discovered diamonds on
his property on Prairie Creek, 2144 miles south-southeast of Mur-
freesboro, Ark. One stone was submitted to the Mermod, Jaccard &
King Jewelry Co., of St. Louis, and a little later other stones were
examined by George F. Kunz, a gem expert, of New York. The
stones came from an area of weathered peridotite that had long been
recognized by geologists as similar to the diamond-bearing peridotite
of South Africa, so it was evident that an original source of diamonds
had been discovered in North America.

The existence of peridotite in this part of Arkansas was known
as early as 1842. The first detailed report describing the geologic
relations and nature of the peridotite was published in 1889 by John
C. Branner, State geologist of Arkansas, and R. N. Brackett.
Branner, in an article published in 1909, states that at the time of his
field examination, in the late eighties, he recognized the peridotite
as the kind of rock in which diamonds occur in South Africa. He
spent many hours on his hands and knees looking for diamonds in
the gullies and over the bare surfaces of the decomposed rock, but
he did not dare mention at that time his suspicion that diamonds
might be found in that region, because any such suggestion would
have added fuel to the wild mining excitement that was then raging
farther north in Arkansas.

The finding of the diamonds by Huddleston led to a search which
resulted in the discovery of three other exposures of peridotite.

LOCATION

Peridotite 1s exposed in four areas, all near Murfreesboro, Pike
County, Ark., three of which have produced diamonds. The ex-
posure first discovered lies 214 miles south-southeast of Murfrees-
DIAMONDS IN ARKANSAS—MISER AND ROSS 968

boro, near the confluence of Prairie Creek with Little Missouri
River, and is known as the Prairie Creek peridotite area. Several
thousand stones, ranging in weight fromasmall fraction of a carat to
40.23 carats, have been found, most of them coming from the Ozark,
Mauney, and Arkansas mines. The other exposures of peridotite
are all within an area of 1 square mile, about 2 miles northeast of
the Prairie Creek locality and 3 miles 8S. 75° E. of Murfreesboro.
Two of these exposures, the Kimberlite and American areas, so named
for the Kimberlite and American mines located on them, are in sec.
14, T. 8 S., R. 25 W.; the third, the Black Lick area, is near a locality
known as the Black Lick, in the northwest corner of sec. 23, T. 8 S.,
R. 25 W. The Kimberlite and American areas have been prospected
for diamonds and each has produced a small number of stones. The
Black Lick area has been prospected less than any of the others and
has thus far produced no diamonds.

These known areas of diamond-bearing peridotite are in the Gulf
Coastal Plain, only a few miles south of its northern margin, be-
yond which lies the Ouachita Mountain region. The Ouachita re-
gion, which is 50 to 60 miles wide, extends from Little Rock, Ark., to
Atoka, Okla., a distance of 200 miles. It contains numerous nearly
eastward trending ridges, several intermontane basins, and a dis-
sected Piedmont Plateau known as the Athens Plateau, which is 15
miles wide, lying between the Coastal Plain and the Ouachita Moun-
tains. The surface features and also the geologic structure of this
part of Arkansas are therefore very similar to those of the Central
and South Atlantic States. The Gulf Coastal Plain, which corre-
sponds to the Atlantic Coastal Plain, is bordered on the north by
the Athens Plateau, which corresponds to the Piedmont Plateau.
North of the Athens Plateau there are closely spaced parallel ridges
of the Ouachita Mountains, which correspond in appearance and
relative position to the Appalachian Mountains between eastern
Pennsylvania and northern Alabama.

The Kimberlite, American, and Black Lick areas of peridotite are
on a deeply channeled plateau that lies east of Little Missouri River.
The Prairie Creek area adjoins the bottom lands of Little Missouri
River and Prairie Creek.

The region in which the diamond deposits occur is sparsely popu-
lated, except in the leVel or gently rolling upland and valley areas,
where most of the tillable land occurs.

ROCKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PERIDOTITE

The rocks associated with the peridotite are sedimentary and
are of Carboniferous, Lower Cretaceous, Upper Cretaceous, and
Quaternary ages. The Carboniferous rocks are shales and sand-
264 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

stones, which were compressed into close east-west folds near the
middle of the Pennsylvanian epoch. Between this epoch and the
Lower Cretaceous epoch they were greatly eroded and a peneplain
was formed which beveled their upturned edges. This peneplain
was submerged near Murfreesboro as well as in other areas during
the Lower Cretaceous epoch, and upon it several hundred feet of
gravel, sand, clay, and limestone, which comprise the Trinity forma-
tion, was laid down. Another period of erosion followed the Lower
Cretaceous epoch. In consequence of this the next younger strata,
the volcanic tuffs, gravels, sands, and clays of the Bingen formation,
of Upper Cretaceous age, rest unconformably upon the Trinity
formation. Both the Trinity and the Bingen have a dip of about
100 feet to the mile toward the south. Terrace and alluvial deposits
of Quaternary age which consist of gravels and silts 25 feet thick
or less occur along Little Missouri River and its larger tributaries.
Peridotite was intruded into the Carboniferous rocks and the
Trinity formation. The Carboniferous sandstones have been
changed to quartzites at places, and the clays of the Trinity forma-
tion have been vitrified for a few feet away from the peridotite.

CHARACTER OF THE PERIDOTITE

The peridotite in each of the four separate areas is similar. The
area of peridotite near the mouth of Prairie Creek, which so far
as known is larger than the others, presents much the best rock ex-
posures and has produced practically all of the diamonds found
up to the present time in Arkansas. Although this area comprises
about 73 acres, the exposures of the hard unweathered rock cover
not more than 12 acres, for the peridotite has weathered to a soft
earth at many places and to a fairly soft rock at others. (See
Pls. 1, 2, and 3.) The depth of the altered peridotite has not been
fully determined, though drill holes have shown that it is at some
places at least 205 feet. The surface soil that overlies it to a depth
of 1 to 4 feet is black from the presence of organic matter and is
known as “black ground.”

The peridotite is divisible into three rather distinct types. One
is a massive little-weathered rock that the miners call “ hardebank,”
which was intruded and which solidified in place. Another is vol-
canic breccia that was blown out of the craters by violent explosive
outbursts of volcanic activity. The third is a volcanic tuff of finer
grained material that was deposited in about the same way as the
breccia.

The hard unweathered massive rock, the “ hardebank,” is a por-
phyry containing large crystals of olivine (now partly altered to ser-
pentine) and brown mica, inclosed in a finer grained groundmass
DIAMONDS IN ARKANSAS—MISER AND ROSS 265

of brown mica, augite, and a small quantity of pervoskite, magnetite,
and chromite. ;

The volcanic breccia is a consolidated aggregate composed of vol-
canic fragments ranging from dustlike material up to pebbles half
an inch or more in diameter. The original minerals have been
largely altered to serpentine, but the breccia is essentially similar
in mineral composition to the “hardebank.” The breccia is, how-
ever, diamond bearing, whereas the “ hardebank” and the volcanic
tuff appear to contain few if any diamonds. The diamonds con-
stitute a remarkably small proportion of even the most productive
rock. It is interesting to note that at the great Premier mine, in
South Africa, where the yield is very accurately known, diamonds
constitute less than 1 part in 12,000,000 of the peridotite. The
breccia, being fragmenta], has been much more thoroughly weathered
than the massive “ hardebank,” and the products of the weathering
are at most places a soft earth and at others a fairly soft rock.
These weathered materials show many shades of green, blue, and
yellow, and are known by the miners as “ green ground,” “blue
ground,” and “ yellow ground.”

The volcanic tuff was probably formed in the same way as the
breccia, and the original minerals were probably similar. It has,
however, undergone a different type of alteration; and though the
breccia is now largely serpentine, the tuff contains much chlorite,
which gives a distinctly blue color.

The volcanic eruptions that brought about the formation of the
diamond-bearing beds differed from the more familiar type of
volcanic eruption in that there was probably little extrusion of lavas,
but the explosive force must have been stupendous. A pipelike cra-
ter was blasted through older rocks, and fragments of these rocks
were mixed with the shattered peridotite, thus forming the volcanic
breccia. The massive “hardebank” probably welled up into the
throat of the crater and cooled there without producing notable
flows.

RELATION OF THE PERIDOTITE TO THE OTHER IGNEOUS ROCKS
OF ARKANSAS

The peridotite in Pike County is of the same age or nearly the
same age as the other igneous rocks of Arkansas, which consist of
nephelite, syenite, pulaskite, and related types of intrusive rocks and
which occur in four small separate areas in the eastern part of the
Ouachita Mountain region and in the northwest border of the Gulf
Coastal Plain. One of these areas is in the Fourche Mountain region
near Little Rock, Pulaski County, where the igneous rocks have
yielded bauxite deposits; a second is near Bauxite, Saline County,
266 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

where there are other bauxite deposits; a third is at Magnet Cove,
Hot Spring County, from which beautiful mineral specimens have
found their way into most of the museums of the world; and a
fourth is at Potash Sulphur Springs, Garland County. In addition
to these areas, hundreds of dikes of igneous rock are found here and
there through much of the eastern half of the Ouachita Mountain
region.
AGE OF THE PERIDOTITE

The intrusion of the peridotite probably accompanied the dias-

trophic movements that produced the down warping of the Mis-
sissippi embayment early in Upper Cretaceous time.
_ Although the rocks of the four different exposures mentioned are
not connected at the surface, the similarity of the material makes it
seem very probable that they are of common origin. The three types
of peridotite were apparently formed by three distinct volcanic out-
bursts, but they are so closely related that they probably mark suc-
cessive stages in a single period of volcanic activity. The evidence
so far obtained indicates that the igneous history of the region was
probably as follows:

First, the massive peridotite, probably accompanied by explosions,
was intruded into the Carboniferous and Lower Cretaceous rocks.
Next, volcanic explosions broke into small fragments not only much
of the massive peridotite but some of the Carboniferous shale and
sandstone. In the area of peridotite near Prairie Creek the frag-
ments ejected into the air were deposited in inclined layers which,
in hardening, have formed a breccia. The layers dip 30° W. in the
Ozark mine (pl. 2, fig. 2), 20°-30° SW. at the apex of the Mauney
mine, and 50° or more toward the north near the south side of the
Arkansas mine. The fact that the layers thus dip toward the center
of the exposure of peridotite near Prairie Creek strongly suggests
that the vent or vents from which the fragments were ejected were
near the center of the Prairie Creek area and that the fragments
were deposited within the crater of a volcano.

A second group of explosions probably formed the tuffs of the
area near Prairie Creek.

The peridotite is younger than the Trinity formation, which is
of Lower Cretaceous age, as is shown by the high dip of the contacts
between the peridotite and the nearly horizontal beds of the Trinity,
by the metamorphism of the clay of the Trinity adjacent to its
contact with the peridotite, and by the occurrence in the peridotite
of fragments of clay and pebbles derived from the Trinity.

The peridotite is probably of the same age as the Bingen forma-
tion (Upper Cretaceous), though it may be older. This is shown
by the fact that the lower beds of the Bingen contain at places
DIAMONDS IN ARKANSAS—MISER AND ROSS 267

altered grains of serpentine and fragments of peridotite. That the
peridotite is not younger than the Bingen is shown by the fact that
the Bingen rests upon the peridotite at the American mine and at
the Black Lick.

COMPARISON OF ARKANSAS AND SOUTH AFRICAN ROCKS

The peridotite of Arkansas is generally believed to be similar in
character and mode of occurrence to that of South Africa, but the
exact points of similarity have not been recorded. Wagner,? who
has carefully studied the South African diamond deposits, says of
them:

The pipes represent deeply eroded, funnel-shaped volcanic necks of the
Maar type, which appear to have been formed by the violent explosive libera-
tion at the earth’s surface of highly compressed vapors and gases, emanating
from a deep-seated, ultrabasic magma. They are occupied, as a rule, by
nonyolcanie detritus derived from the shattering and comminution of the
rocks pierced by the explosions, by fragmentary material derived from tritura-
tion of kimberlite [peridotite], and at greater depths by solid plugs of the
later rock.’

Dealing first with the relationship of pipes to fissures, we have learned that
the magma in its ascent appears invariably to have been guided to within a
greater or less distance of the original surface by planes of structural weak-
ness in the earth’s crust. * * * The earliest eruptions appear to have been
in the nature of mighty explosions, which resulted in blowing out of funnel-
shaped apertures. The bulk of the material forcibly ejected during these out-
bursts no doubt fell back into the vents, which at one stage of their history
may thus have been more or less completely occupied by nonvolcanic detritus.
The relief of pressure occasioned by these earlier explosions must be assumed
to have led to the ascent of the magma into the pipes, where it appears, as a
rule, to have given rise, by successive eruptions, to a number of distinct
columns of kimberlite [peridotite] and kimberlite tuff.‘

The material that occupies the vents Wagner describes as follows:

It has been pointed out that in so far as the pipe filling is concerned, the
rocks pierced by the explosions, the kimberlite magma, and the atmosphere
have all contributed.®

We may divide * * * the foreign matter of the pipes into three principal
groups—rock fragments derived from the adjacent pipe walls; xenoliths [in-
cluded fragments] of rock which have been brought up from below; masses
of rock which, to attain the position in which we now find them, must have
fallen into the pipes from above.®

The pipe rock proper consists of kimberlite and of material derived from
its brecciation, comminution, and decomposition.”

The microscope reveals the fact that among the products comprehended
under the general term of blue ground three main varieties may be distin-

guished. These are the true kimberlite tuff or kimberlite breccia, injection
breccia, and decomposed kimberlite. * * * As greater depths are attained
in the mines the products we have hitherto been dealing with, as one would
naturally expect, are replaced in increasing measure by “hardebank,” or kim-
berlite, the parent rock, to the trituration and decomposition of which they
owe their origin.®

Wagner divides the diamond-bearing rocks of South Africa into
two types, both of which occur as intrusives and as volcanic breccias.
One of these is a “basaltic kimberlite,” rich in olivine and poor in
mica, and the other is a “ mica peridotite.” Both types are diamond-
bearing in South Africa, but the first has produced most of the
diamonds.

The quotations and abstracts given above, which outline very
briefly the type of eruption and describe the diamond-bearing rocks
of South Africa, serve as a basis for comparison with the diamond-
bearing rocks of Arkansas. In South Africa work has proceeded to
great depths—8,601 feet in the Kimberley mine—and the geologic
relations are known in considerable detail, whereas in Arkansas only
the surface of the ground has been scratched. Nevertheless rather
striking points of similarity between the diamond-bearing rocks of
South Africa and of Arkansas are evident.

The violence of the volcanic explosions by which the South
African vents were produced and the extent to which the kimberlite
and country rock were shattered and mixed together in the vents
have been emphasized. In Arkansas the peridotite was evidently
much shattered and the explosive violence brought to the surface
Paleozoic rocks that lay far beneath the surface. Injection breccias
that are composed of shattered country rock mixed with a small
proportion of volcanic material and that have the characteristics of
dikes have been identified in both areas.

In many of the South African vents recurring volcanic activity
produced compound pipes that are formed of slightly different rocks
and that even bear diamonds of dissimilar character. Petrographic
studies have shown that in Arkansas there are at least three types
of rock, only one of which carries diamonds in considerable quantity.

DIAMONDS

Nearly all the diamonds obtained from Arkansas have been found
within the exposures of peridotite in the area near Prairie Creek and
at the Kimberlite and American mines near by, though a very few
diamonds have been found along streams that have washed them
from these areas. The mines that have produced diamonds are the
Ozark, Mauney, Arkansas, Kimberlite, and American. Although
most of the diamonds at these mines have been found on or near
the surface, others have been found at depths of as much as 20 feet.

8 Op. cit., pp. 27-28.
DIAMONDS IN ARKANSAS—MISER AND ROSS 269

How much deeper the diamonds may lie is not known, but they
probably extend to depths much greater than that to which mining
can be carried.

The yield of diamonds in carats per load of diamond-bearing
material differs at different places in the mines and also at different
depths. This yield, as it has been determined from the great amount
of work at one mine, is 1 carat for 8 loads (16 cubic feet) of diamond-
bearing material. In South Africa the yield of diamonds ranges
from 6 to 42 carats from 100 loads.

Most of the diamonds from the Ozark, Mauney, and Arkansas
mines have been obtained within the areas in which the volcanic
breccia is exposed. Austin Q. Millar, one of the operators, states that
the soft, decomposed peridotite overlying the “ hardebank” (massive
intrusive peridotite) in the north part of the Mauney mine is nearly
or entirely barren of diamonds, and that the soft blue, somewhat
banded earth (altered peridotite tuff) that covers a small area on
the Ozark mine is barren of diamonds.

The diamonds have probably been concentrated on and near the
surface by weathering and erosion. The great amount of erosion
that the peridotite has undergone has removed from the outcrop of
the peridotite much of the clay and other minerals having a low
specific gravity leaving perhaps most of the diamonds and other
heavier minerals. The heavier minerals thus concentrated are in
the black ground. Mr. Miser has shown, by panning samples of
black ground and of the underlying green and blue grounds, that the
quantity of heavier minerals to the cubic foot is many times greater
in the black ground than in the underlying material. The supposi-
tion that there has been a surficial concentration of diamonds is also
-apparently supported by the results of washing done by the Ozark
Diamond Mines Corporation, which obtained a larger yield of dia-
monds from surface material than from the underlying disintegrated
rock.

The number of diamonds that have been found near Murfreesboro,
Ark., since their discovery in 1906 is only known in part, for the
mining companies have withheld from publication the figures show-
ing complete production. So far as the authors know, however, the
output to date amounts to at least 10,000 diamonds.

Most of the diamonds from the mines near Murfreesboro have been
held by the mining companies, though some uncut stones have been
sold. The first cut stones were offered for sale in 1921 by Tiffany
& Co., of New York City, and by the Chas. S. Stifft Co., of Little
Rock, Ark.

The diamonds that have been found range in weight from a very
small fraction of a carat to many carats. Some are so small that
250 of them would be required to weigh 1 carat. The largest
270 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

diamond, which was found in the Arkansas mine in the summer of
1924, weighed 40.23 carats; one weighing 20.25 carats was found in
the Arkansas mine in September, 1921, and one weighing 17.86 carats
was found in the same mine in May, 1917. The average weight of
the 3,000 diamonds that had been produced by the Arkansas mine at
the end of 1920 was about 0.4 carat, but the average weight of the
diamonds that make up the entire product of all the mines is
probably between 0.3 and 0.4 carat.

Most of the diamonds are white, brown, or yellow. According
to Kunz and Washington, there is a large proportion of white
stones, most of them of a high grade in color, brilliancy, and freedom
from flaws. These authors also say that many of the stones are as
fine as any that have been found elsewhere, and that some of the
yellow ones are of exceptional quality and color. In describing
several yellow, brown, and white stones from the Arkansas mine
Kunz says: “ These are absolutely perfect and are equal to the finest
stones found at the Jagersfontein mine, or that were ever found in
India.”

Mr. Millar states that the white stones comprise 40 per cent of
the mine run yield from the Mauney and Ozark mines, that the yel-
low stones comprise 22 per cent, the brown stones 37 per cent, and
bort 1 per cent. Stones having a blue or pink tinge have been found
and occasionally a “ frosted ” or etched white stone is found. Most
of the diamonds are crystals, and the most common forms are
trisoctahedrons and hexoctahedrons, though some octahedrons and
dodecahedrons are found. Crystals with sharp angular faces are
rare; rounded surfaces greatly predominate. Fragments and frac-
tures are much more numerous among stones recovered from surface
material than they are in stones taken from slight depths in the
volcanic ground.

The diamonds shown on Plate 2, Figure 1, are all crystals and are
described by W. T. Schaller as follows:

The crystals seem to be rounded and distorted hexoctahedrons; the bound-
ing faces are not typical crystal faces but are end forms toward which the
curved faces tend.

Crystal No. 1: Slightly smoky or brownish in color; probably a flattened
and distorted octahedron or hexoctahedron with possibly additional forms.
Several of the rounded faces have parallel octahedral-like “etch hills” or
“ridges”’ on them.

Crystals Nos. 2 and 3: Colorless; probably distorted flattened” hexoctahe-
drons.

Crystal No. 4: Brownish; elongated crystal with ends not complete; a
different phase of distortion.

Crystal No. 5: Yellow; very little distorted; essentially a rounded octahe-
dron, the octahedral faces being replaced by the rounded faces of a hexoctahe-
dron. Shows several solution “ pits,” one quite deep, in the position of the cube.

hedrons.

MINING AND TREATMENT OF DIAMOND-BEARING MATERIAL

Probably several hundred diamonds have been picked up by
miners from the surface of the peridotite areas, especially the Prairie
Creek area, but most of the diamonds have been obtained by wash-
ing the diamond-bearing material. Different methods of mining
and washing have been employed, in part because of the diverse
character of the diamond-bearing material which differs not only
from one locality to another but also at different depths.

Much of the decomposed peridotite, including the surficial black
soil called “black ground” and also a large part of the underlying
“blue ground,” “ yellow ground,” and “ green ground,” is soft enough
to be washed for the recovery of the diamonds without being crushed
or weathered first. Most of the black ground is very sticky, like
gumbo, when it is wet, so that it disintegrates with some difficulty in
the washing plants. Experiments are said to show that when thor-
oughly dried and then washed it absorbs water rapidly, swells, and
finally slacks to a thin mud. Much of the diamond-bearing mate-
rial, especially that of some of the “blue ground” and “green
ground,” is fairly hard and requires crushing, exposure to weather-
ing, or other treatment for the recovery of diamonds. The unaltered
peridotite, called “ hardebank,” and the unaltered peridotite breccia
are so hard and tough that they probably can not be treated in any
way for the extraction of diamonds except by crushing, which would
doubtless fracture some of the diamonds.

All the mining has been done in shallow open cuts. Some
hydraulic mining has been done (pl. 3, fig. 1), but most of the mate-
rial mined has been removed by hand and by means of plows and
scrapers, and hauled to washing plants in tram cars which have a
capacity of 16 cubic feet each.

In hydraulic mining the water carries the disintegrated diamond-
bearing material through a sluice trough, from which the sluiced
materials are washed into small plants, where they are sized and
jigged. Then the concentrates are placed on smooth sheets of metal
and carefully searched for diamonds.

A log washer was used for a short time in the Ozark washing
plant, but it was not successful on account of the stickiness of the
“black ground ” that was washed in it.

Washing pans of the type common in the South African diamond
fields have been successfully used. Such a pan is circular, has a
272 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

flat bottom, and rests in a horizontal position. At its center there
is a vertical revolving shaft to which radiating arms are attached.
On these arms are metal teeth that revolve in the pan and thus
stir the diamond-bearing material that is fed into the pan. Dur-
ing this stirring the diamonds and associated heavy minerals gradu-
ally settle to the bottom of the pan, while the clay and other light
minerals rise to the surface and flow out of the pan near its center.
The concentrates thus obtained in the bottom of the pan are then
sized and nextjigged. Thejigged concentrates are carefully searched
for diamonds on metal-covered tables or are washed by water over a
table which is covered with a thick film of grease and which is
shaken rapidly from side to side by an eccentric. While the con-
centrates are washed across the table the grease sticks to the dia-
monds and holds them, whereas it does not stick to the other min-
erals, most of which are therefore washed off the table. The grease
and the diamonds and other minerals embedded in it are removed
from the tables from time to time. The diamonds are then freed
from the grease by converting it into soap or by putting it into
boiling water.

._ RECENT PROGRESS AND TRENDS IN VERTEBRATE
PALEONTOLOGY 2

By W. D. MATTHEW

INTRODUCTION

In science, as in our business and personal affairs, it is profitable
from time to time to look over the ground and see how much we have
accomplished in recent years. The present occasion would seem to be
a suitable one in which to render an account of recent progress in
that branch of paleontology with which I am principally acquainted.
It is not a catalogue of recent publications, nor a summary of their
contents that is presented in this address, but rather a report of
progress, with some suggestions as to where this progress seems to
be leading us.

The foundations of paleontology, the documents on which our re-
searches are based, consist of the collections of fossils, which are our
record of the past history of life. The breadth and solidity of those
foundations must determine both the size and the permanence of the
structure that we may erect thereon. It is no small part of our duty
as architects thereof to examine carefully from time to time into the
adequacy of these foundations, to condemn and sweep away such
parts of our structure as appear to be insufficiently supported, flimsy,
or outworn. They may have served their purpose in the past as tem-
porary outworks, trial sketches or models, or provisional scaffolding
to aid in the erection of our more permanent structures; but they
should not be confused with sclid and stable additions, nor should
they be allowed to outlive their usefulness. A critical review of our
foundations and of their recent extension is the foremost and most
important matter before us.

In the early days of paleontology fossil vertebrates were known
from few and mostly very fragmentary specimens. Our concepts of
extinct animals were built up from the study and correlation of
numerous fragments, supplemented largely by the analogy of living
relatives of the extinct animals. The correlations were sometimes
incorrect, the analogies were always inexact and often misleading.
Of the theories and conclusions based by our predecessors on these
relatively scanty foundations, some have been swept away and for-

gotten, some have been modified in varying degree, some have been
confirmed and vindicated by subsequent discovery.

The more intensive collecting of recent years, and especially the
technique devised by Hatcher and Wortman for the purpose of
preserving the whole of a fossil skull or skeleton, have brought in
year by year a larger proportion of complete specimens of fossil ver-
tebrates. The leading American museums are to-day peculiarly rich
in complete and well-preserved material, and the more progressive
museums of Europe have likewise adopted these methods, greatly to
the improvement of their collections.

It is difficult to find any basis for a quantitative estimate of the in-
crease in our collections, or even of any particular portion of them.
So far as the American Museum collections go, the Cope collection,
gathered between 1872 and 1896, covers about 25 per cent of the
catalogue numbers, but is not in reality over 10 per cent of the collec-
tions in this department, as in former years many specimens were
separately catalogued that would not now be considered worth indi-
vidual record. The other 90 per cent was gathered during the last 30
years, and progressively more during the later decades. Perhaps it
would be fair to say that 20 per cent was gathered from 1892-1902,
30 per cent from 1902-1912, and 40 per cent from 1912-1922. Other
institutions would have proportions different from these. Probably
in Yale University or the National Museum the proportion of ma-
terial collected and prepared over 30 years ago would be higher; on
the other hand, in the newer institutions all the material is relatively
recent. It is reasonable to regard the American Museum as fairly
representative in this matter and to conclude that, so far as American
collections go, nine-tenths of them have been obtained during the last
30 years and nearly half during the last 12 years.

Progress in foreign museums has not been so rapid, especially in
Europe, where the earlier collections were more important and the
World War seriously curtailed, if it did not eliminate, all scientific
activities. Yet even in Europe large additions have been made since
the beginning of the century and some important ones within the
last decade. Judging from what I saw of the principal European
museums in 1900 and again two years ago, it would, perhaps, strike
a fair average to estimate that their collections have been nearly
doubled since 1900.

I will try to specify the more important points in the progress of
the last 10 or 12 years.

PALEOZOIC REPTILES, PERMIAN OF TEXAS AND SOUTH AFRICA

On the origin of land vertebrates there is little to report in the
way of new discoveries, although the researches of Gregory and
Watson in respect to the relations of the earliest land vertebrates to
VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY—-MATTHEW 2715

the fringe-finned fishes have advanced our understanding of the
problem; nor have any important new collections been made among
the earliest land vertebrate faunas of the Pennsylvanian period.
Moodie’s monographic revision of the Coal Measures amphibia and
reptiles? affords a most valuable compendium of what is known up
to the present time.

In the Permian faunas, both in Texas and South Africa, there has
been a great advance, both in collecting and research, continuing the
activity of the previous decade. Professor Case,’ of Michigan Uni-
versity, and the late Doctor Williston,‘ at the University of Chicago,
have been the leaders in this country, and have secured and described
large collections from Texas and Oklahoma and greatly increased
our knowledge of this ancient vertebrate fauna. The Cope Permian
collections at the American Museum have been studied and com-
pared with the South African faunas by Case, Gregory,’ Broom,é
Watson,’ and von Huene,* and important collections from the Texas
Permian have been obtained for the Tiibingen and Munich museums
in Germany. There shall be noted, also, the fine skeleton of the fin-
back reptile Dimetrodon, recently mounted in the National Museum.®
The South African Permian has also been vigorously exploited by
Broom, Watson, Haughton,’° and Van Hoepen”™ and large collec-
tions made, including many finely preserved skulls and skeletons.
This fauna is of peculiar interest as containing apparently the be-
ginnings of the evolution of mammals, birds, and dinosaurs. It is
significant that it is regarded as the fauna of an arid or desert region,

rather in contrast to the fluviatile or littoral facies represented by
the Texas Permian.

The third great area for Permian vertebrates, the Dvina River, in
Poland, has not, so far as I know, been seriously exploited since the
work of Amalitzky, 20 years ago, nor has anything been added to
Fritsch’s pioneer work in Bohemia.

With all that has been done, we really know very little as yet of
the Permian land animals. The period was a most important and
critical one in the evolution of land life, for it witnessed the first
great expansion of land vertebrates, and the origin, probably, of
mammals, birds, and the principal orders of reptiles, including
dinosaurs. What we know best is the river-delta fauna of the Lower
Permian in Texas, a series of plains or desert faune of Upper Per-
mian age in South Africa, and probably a similar facies in Poland;
asmall Permian swamp fauna in Bohemia, and a few items from other
regions. These must represent but a small proportion of the variety
and scope of land life of the Permian world. How imperfect a pic-
ture it gives may be judged by supposing that our knowledge
of the modern land vertebrates were similarly limited to the animals
of a South African desert, a Texas delta, and a swamp in central
Europe, with a few odds and ends from elsewhere. The zoogeo-
grapher would be bold indeed who propounded theories of distri-
bution and migration based on data so limited, and it is to be feared
that his conclusions would bear but little relation to the realities.
While it is thus necessary to emphasize the limitations of our knowl-
edge, it is but fair to say that it is vastly greater than it was a
decade or two ago. The number of genera on record is not so greatly
increased, but our systematic and anatomical acquaintance with the
characteristic types is more than doubled.

TRIASSIC REPTILES AND AMPHIBIANS OF GERMANY

Turning to the age of reptiles, we have in the Triassic the least
known chapter, so far as America is concerned, and very little has
been added to this chapter in the last decade. What little has been
accomplished in this direction is due to the energetic prospecting
of Doctor Case, and contains promising prospect for the future as
well as a few but very interesting additions to the Triassic faune.??
In Europe, however, the recent discoveries of Triassic dinosaurs
at Halberstadt and Trossingen in Germany and the discovery of a
complete skeleton of a South African Triassic dinosaur have given
an adequate basis for the study of these primitive dinosaurs and
appreciation of their real relations to the specialized dinosaurs of
the later geologic periods. Especially is the discovery by von Huene,

2H. C. Case (1922): Carnegie Inst. Pub. no. 321. >
VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY—MATTHEW O77

in new excavations at Trossingen during the past two seasons, of a
series of a dozen or so more or less complete dinosaur skeletons likely
to be of great scientific value. Scarcely less important is a large
quarry of skulls and skeletons of the great Triassic labyrinthodont
Mastodonsaurus, in the Black Forest region by Professor Wepfner,
and the discovery of complete skeletons of the very peculiar reptile
Placodus, whose teeth were found long ago in Germany and supposed
to be the pavement-teeth of a fish allied to the rays. This fine skele-
ton is being studied by Doctor Drevermann, of the Senckenberg
Museum.

JURASSIC DINOSAURS OF UTAH AND EAST AFRICA

The two outstanding features of progress in Jurassic land reptiles
are the great dinosaur quarry worked by the Carnegie Museum near
Jensen, in the Vernal Valley, Utah, and the Tendaguru dinosaur
collections from German East Africa secured for the Berlin Museum.
So far as I can judge from the record maps of the Jensen quarry,
which I had the privilege of inspecting through the courtesy of Mr.
Douglass, the material secured there is greater in quantity and
finer in quality than the sum of all that has been obtained hitherto
in America. The preparation of this huge collection will be a labor
of many years, however it be arranged; but as a result we may look
forward confidently to more than doubling our present knowledge
of Morrison dinosaurs.

The memoirs by Gilmore ** on the carnivorous and armored dino-
saurs in the National Museum, chiefly of the Morrison fauna, are of
the highest authority and importance, and his restudy of the Potomac
fauna '* of Lower Cretaceous age shows that it is not the Morrison,
‘as formerly supposed, but of decidedly later age. The Tendaguru
collection is likewise an immense task in preparation, and when I
saw it in Berlin, 2 years ago, it was far from being completed, after
more than 10 years’ work. It provides a fairly complete skeletal
knowledge of some half dozen types of dinosaurs** and fragments
of a few others, representing a fauna similar in broad lines to the

Morrison fauna, nearly similar in its adaptive facies, and approxi-
mately of the same age, but inhabiting a different continent, and of
the highest importance in giving some really adequate data as to
the faunal distribution at that epoch. It is too early yet to draw
conclusions, but my impression from a superficial review was that
the Tendaguru and Morrison faunas showed a very close adaptive
similarity, but were not so closely related as they seemed. It is,
fortunately, possible to correlate the Tendaguru dinosaurs exactly
through marine faunas in interdigitating formations. This in turn
aids greatly in the correlation of the Morrison fauna, and Schuchert
has shown’® that there is strong reason to place it rather at the
end of the Jurassic than at the beginning of the Cretaceous. This
conclusion is further supported by Gilmore’s new evidence as to the
relations of the Potomac fauna.

CRETACEOUS DINOSAURS OF ALBERTA, MONTANA, AND NEW
MEXICO

It is in the Cretaceous dinosaurs that we can record the greatest
progress in the last 10 or 15 years. It is not so long ago that our
practical knowledge of Cretaceous dinosaurian faunas was almost
confined to one horizon and to one small area. Substantially, it was
the Lance fauna that we knew, and to what extent the fragmentary
fossils recorded from other formations and other areas were really
distinguishable from those of the Lance was a subject of acrimonious
debate. To-day we have extended the scope of our geographic
knowledge as far as central Alberta to the north and New Mexico
to the south, and have been able to distinguish four well separated
geologic zones, each represented by a fauna known from a series
of more or less complete skeletons. The earliest of these faunal
zones is the St. Mary’s of the Milk River district in Montana; the
second and best known is the Belly River of the Red Deer River
in Alberta; the third is the Edmonton of the same region, and the
fourth, the Lance of Wyoming and Montana. The great collections
secured from the Belly River by the American Museum, the Ottawa,
Toronto, and Edmonton museums in Canada, and the Field Museum
in Chicago are still being prepared and studied, but it is already
evident that it was a surprisingly large and varied fauna, of which
the Lance was but a remnant, consisting of a few highly specialized
survivors.?”

VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY—MATTHEW 279

Another interesting phase of recent progress in this group is the
probable difference in faunas widely apart geographically and in
different climatic zones. The splendid specimens secured by Charles
H. Sternberg in the last two seasons in the San Juan basin of New
Mexico appear to represent a fauna clearly distinct from any of the
three great northern faunas. Their true correlation has yet to be
determined by a more exact study of the fauna and stratigraphy.
but Mr. Sternberg’s latest work, performed under heavy handicaps
opens up an important new field for dinosaur collecting and is the
last of a long series of important finds made by him during the
last 50 years. A fine skull and much of the skeleton of a gigantic
Ceratopsian has been secured by the American Museum; other im-
portant specimens are still in his hands and in the Upsala Museum
in Sweden.

THE DINOSAURS NOT A NATURAL ORDER

The dinosaurs are now generally recognized as not a natural order
of reptiles, but a composite group, including two distinct and rather
distantly related orders. Dinosaurs correspond in a way to pachy-
derms among mammals, once considered a natural order, but now
recognized as an assemblage of animals superficially alike, owing
to parallel adaptation, but not really related. It is in this sense
that the term “dinosaurs” should henceforth be used and not as a
natural order of reptiles. The two orders are the Saurischia, in-
cluding Marsh’s two groups of Sauropoda and Theropoda, and the
Ornithischia, or Orthopoda, the Predentata of Marsh. The first
group includes the gigantic amphibious dinosaurs, the great carnivor-
ous dinosaurs, and their slender, swift-running allies, and the more
primitive Triassic dinosaurs. Orthopoda include the iguanodonts
and duck-billed dinosaurs, the horned dinosaurs, and the armored
dinosaurs. All these are distinguished by a horny beak or bill and
a more birdlike arrangement of the pelvic bones, and have a cer-
tain degree of affinity to primitive birds, whereas the Saurischian
order has a corresponding relation to primitive crocodiles. The fine

CENOZOIC MAMMALS OF WESTERN AMERICA

In the field of Tertiary mammals progress has been made at many
points. The great series of Tertiary faunas in this country has
been improved all along the line. Collections from each horizon
have been greatly increased; many new or little known species are
now represented by complete skulls and skeletons. Careful in-
tensive stratigraphic work in the fossil fields and more exact records
of all specimens enable us to define more accurately the limits and
succession of faunas and evolution of phyla. A great advance has
been made in the Lower Eocene and Paleocene faunas, the former
representing, as I see it, the true beginnings of the Tertiary mam-
malian succession in this country, while the latter, whatever its
precise geologic position may prove to be, is essentially the culmina-
tion and close of a Cretaceous mammal fauna whose earlier evolu-
tionary stages are wholly unknown to us, either because they in-
habited upland areas, where their remains were not preserved, or
because they lived in some other region whose Cretaceous land
faunas have not yet been discovered.”

In the Lower Eocene the most remarkable discovery is the Diat-
ryma, a gigantic ground bird resembling the Phororhachos of the
South American Miocene, but not related to it and standing apart
in a group by itself.”*

In the Oligocene, Sinclair? has inaugurated an intensive strati-
graphic-faunal study of the typical White River bad-lands that will
serve as a foundation for comparison and correlation much more
exact and accurate than has been possible hitherto. A remarkable
fossil quarry opened by the Denver Museum ** in the Chadron forma-
ton of Colorado has yielded already a large series of well preserved
skeletons and appears to contain still vast numbers.

In the Lower Miocene the great collections of the Carnegie Mu-
seum from the Agate fossil quarry have been described by Holland

and Peterson in three fine memoirs,2* and the excellent series of
Moropus skeletons obtained by the American Museum from the same
quarry provide a complete knowledge of this extraordinary animal.
Large collections have also been obtained from the Lower Miocene
for the Yale, Amherst, and Field museums.

The later Miocene and Pliocene faunas are represented in the
Snake Creek quarries in Sioux County, Nebr., which have been
worked chiefly by the American Museum.?” While the two great
fossil quarries mentioned above contain complete skulls and skeletons
of a limited number of large animals—-three or four kinds in each—
the Snake Creek quarries contain chiefly fragmentary material of a
great variety of animals, no less than 50 genera being on my list at
present. They are river-channel pockets and are now known to
belong to three distinct faunal zones.

Perhaps the most interesting out of a multitude of new forms
from these quarries are the upper tooth of an anthropoid primate,
Hesperopithecus, the first of this group from the American Tertiary,
and the complete skeleton of Pliohippus, the earliest one-toed stage
in the evolution of the horse. Discovery by Troxell of fine skeletons
of Pliohippus** and of a Tertiary type of mastodon in the Pliocene
of South Dakota, and by Gidley of a large Pliocene fauna in Ari-
zona, should also be mentioned.

The series of later Tertiary faunas discovered by exploring parties
from the University of California, on the Pacific coast and in the
Great Basin provinces, are a most important addition, as they are
almost wholly new fossil fields.2? The material as yet discovered
is largely fragmentary, but a considerable series of faunas has been
differentiated.

In the Pleistocene the great outstanding discovery is the La Brea
asphalt quarries near Los Angeles, remarkable for the numbers, the
variety, and the fine preservation of the specimens. The discovery
of this unique series makes it possible to describe the more character-

PRIMATES AND MAN

The most widely interesting field of paleontological research is that
which deals with the geologic history and evolution of our own race,
and in this field there have been a series of discoveries and re-
searches in recent years of the highest importance.**

First among these I may place the discovery of complete skeletons
of Neanderthal man; the skeleton of Chapelle-aux-Saints, so admir-
ably described by Marcellin Boule; ** the two skeletons of La Fer-
rassie, soon to be described fully by the same distinguished authority,
and a series of less complete but important finds in Germany and
other central European States. These discoveries have given a very
clear and definite concept of the Neanderthal race, as a species clearly
distinct from our own, characterized by a series of well-defined
physical peculiarities, nearer in many particulars to the anthropoid
apes, but clearly not a direct ancestor of our own species.

The fragmentary skull and jaw found m 1911 near Piltdown, in
Sussex, likewise represents an extinct species of man, as different
from the Neanderthal man as from our own race. Although corre-
sponding in its nearer approach to the anthropoid apes, it probably
is not directly ancestral.**

Another remarkable skull, discovered at Broken Hill, in Rhodesia,
while not of high antiquity, is regarded as representing a survival of
the Neanderthal race in South Africa. The Talgai skull from
Queensland, rather doubtfully associated with the Pleistocene fauna
of Australia, is considered as representing a proto-Australian type
of man.

%1 The literature on fossil primates and the evolution of man is very voluminous. A
number of excellent critical reviews of the subject by Osborn, Gregory, Boule, Keith,
Sollas, Giuffreda-Ruggeri, Leche, Arldt, and others cite and discuss the chief contributions.
The most important recent, contributions on Tertiary primates are the following:

VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY—MATTHEW 283

The sum of these discoveries is to impress strongly on the mind
the probability that our own species is but one out of several human
species which lived and flourished and competed one with another
during the Pleistocene period; our own species, perhaps through its
higher social adaptability, being at last supreme, and sole survivor
at the present day. Yet it appears probable that through crossing
and intermixture some of the blood of one or more of these extinct
ypecies of man still survives here and there among our own race
and may yet be recognizable when the application of Mendelism to
systematic osteology and paleontology is more fully understood and
applied, and also when our collections of the remains of fossil man
are so extensive as to admit of such applications. Whatever may be
the prospects of getting anywhere along this line, it is quite clearly
demonstrated by these recent discoveries that the problem of the
ancestry of our race—of the evolution of man—is in reality a much
more complex and difficult one than had been assumed either by the
exponents or opponents of evolution. It is not one missing link that
we have to find, but many. Each of the discoveries I have cited is a
“missing link”; but we can not be satisfied with merely answering
the challenge of the ignorant, and each discovery serves as a spur to
further search.

A remarkable recent discovery is that of a true anthropoid primate
in the Lower Pliocene of this country. While the single upper molar
which Osborn has named Hesperopithecus ** does not prove the pre-
cise affinities of the animal, there is no reasonable doubt in the minds
of those who have studied the original specimen that it is one of the
higher Anthropoidea. The discovery of such a type was not wholly
unexpected, as the writer and Mr. H. C. Cook, in describing the
Snake Creek fauna in 1909, pointed out that certain badly preserved
teeth might perhaps be anthropoid, and that the character of the
associated fauna made such a discovery reasonably possible. Never-
theless it was not considered likely, as the formation had been dili-
gently and repeatedly prospected in subsequent years without success.

FOREIGN RESEARCHES AND DISCOVERIES, MISCELLANEOUS
CONTRIBUTIONS

Paleontological research in other parts of the world is much less
advanced than in North America and Europe, but, in addition to the
few discoveries already mentioned, several other important results of
exploration have already been secured. In the West Indies a more
or less systematic search for fossil vertebrates has been made by the
American Museum, the Museum of Comparative Zoology, and the

National Museum,** and considerable well-preserved material secured
from the Pleistocene of Cuba and Porto Rico, with fragmentary data
on the Pleistocene fauna of Hispaniola and Jamaica. The especial
interest of these insular faunas lies in their source and paleogeo-
graphic bearings. South America affords an immense field for ex-
ploration, but since the death of Florentino Ameghino there is but
little progress to record. The explorations begun by the Field
Museum will, it is hoped, initiate a new period of advance ix our
knowledge of the paleontologic history of this continent.

In Africa considerable reconnaissance work has been done at
yarious points, but beyond the Tendaguru and Karroo discoveries
already noted, the only finds which can be noted here are the Cre-
taceous dinosaurs discovered by Strémer in the Libyan desert.%°
These are of quite a remarkable type—Sauropods and a peculiar car-
nivorous genus—the fauna possibly having descended from the
Wealden fauna; but careful comparative study is still needed.

In India Doctor Matley has obtained an interesting Cretaceous
dinosaur fauna from the Deccan, but only preliminary notices of it
have as yet been published.*? The chief advance in Indian paleon-
tology is the admirable stratigraphic and faunal work of Pilgrim
in sorting out and correlating the heterogeneous group of faunas
hitherto known as the Siwalik fauna.** The splendid collections of
these faunas recently secured by Barnum Brown for the American
Museum deserve special mention, as also the discovery of Oligocene
and Eocene faunas in Baluchistan and Burma by Cooper, Pilgrim,
and Cotter. The gigantic “ Baluchitherium,’ of which parts of the
skeleton were discovered by Cooper,*® is perhaps the largest known
land mammal. Borissiak has reported what seems to be the same
animal in Russia, under the name of /ndricotherium,* and last sum-
mer the American Museum secured a complete skull, nearly five
feet in length, in Mongolia.*

The results of the American Museum explorations in Mongolia are
probably the most important discovery of the last decade. Central

Asia has hitherto been a terra incognita to the vertebrate paleon-
tologist, and the finding of rich and extensive fossil fields in the
Gobi Desert with Cretaceous, Eocene, Oligocene, and Pliocene for-
mations, each yielding considerable faunas and finely preserved
specimens, in the first season’s exploration, promises to open up a
completely new field in vertebrate paleontology.*? Other fossiliferous
horizons will probably be discovered by further explorations, and
the history of the land vertebrates of the great central Asiatic con-
tinent in the Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras will be placed on record
in considerable detail.

In the cellars and storage racks of many museums, both in this
country and abroad, are important collections of fossil vertebrates
acquired many years ago, but never prepared or described. The
labor and expense of preparing, studying, and describing this ma-
terial to make it of use to science is as valuable a contribution as
though it were fresh from the field. A considerable part of the
work in the National Museum and some in the American Museum
has dealt with specimens collected long ago for Marsh and Cope.
Recently the Yale Museum has made a vigorous and highly successful
campaign to prepare and describe the great fossil collections left to
that institution by Professor Marsh. A series of articles by Lull,
Troxell, and Thorpe in the American Journal of Science testifies
to the importance of these additions to our knowledge.

Two very valuable and authoritative memoirs by Doctor Teilhard
de Chardin should be noted in this connection. In one the classic
Cernaysian fauna at the base of the French Eocene is admirably
described and illustrated from the collections in the Paris Museum.‘
The relations of this fauna and correlation with the Paleocene
faunas of this country are now at last based on adequate data. Of
scarcely less importance is Pére Teilhard’s memoir on the carnivora
of the Phosphorite fauna, also based on the unrivaled collections
in the museum at Paris.**

A third important memoir from the Paris Museum, sumptuously
illustrated and admirably presented by the director, Marcellin
Boule,*® describes the fine collections from the Pleistocene of the
Tarija Valley in Bolivia, in the Paris Museum.

Finally, I must not omit to mention a series of great synthetic
studies by Osborn, dealing with the later Tertiary Equide, now pub-

CONCLUSIONS AS TO PROGRESS OF RECENT YEARS

In the foregoing outline of progress I have been concerned chiefly
with discoveries of new material, of new records, because it is the
scanty and fragmentary nature of the evidence that is the chief limit
to research in vertebrate paleontology and the chief source of error
in our conclusions. In the phrase of a French reviewer, vast floods of
ink have been spilled on problems of correlation, of phylogeny, of
paleogeography, where a few questionable fragments of fossil ver-
tebrates formed the salient points of evidence. When in some in-
stances an adequate fauna was discovered, the problem was promptly
and conclusively settled, the flood of ink suddenly ceased to flow, and
deep calm settled over the controversy.

The fundamental progress achieved appears, therefore, to be
measurable better in terms of collections than of researches. I do not
altogether agree with a distinguished Columbia professor who de-
clared not long ago that paleontologists had no business to reason on
or draw conclusions from their specimens, but should content them-
selves with describing and illustrating them.®® Nevertheless, I do
think we should distinguish far more sharply between provisional
and tentative conclusions based on scanty and fragmentary data and
those which are really proven by adequate evidence.

So far as the older and better known fields of vertebrate paleon
tology are concerned, the progress of the past few years has been in
the way of consolidating and confirming what had been tentatively
sketched out by earlier workers. In the newer fields we are reaching

out and securing the first fruits of exploration—the evidence which
will confirm or disprove hypotheses and guesses that hitherto have

had free rein.
SOME TRENDS OF MODERN WORK

In the field of paleogeography I may call attention to three pub-
lications treating the subject from diverse or opposite viewpoints:

Matthew: Climate and evolution, an essay of some 318 pages.

Arldt: Paleogeographie, a treatise of 2 ponderous tomes.

Case: Paleogeography of the Permian, a quarto volume of moder-
ate dimensions.

It is commonly said that paleogeographic problems should be de-
cided only after marshaling all the evidence in every branch of
zoology, past and present, as well as of geology and physiography,
that can be brought to bear on it. This is what Doctor Arldt has
endeavored to do in his great treatise. I do not hold that view, for
it appears to me that unless evidence is thoroughly understood and
critically sifted as to its weight and its real significance, it is of no
value; and it is obviously impossible for human intelligence to attain
a thoroughly critical grasp of so vast a field. On the other hand, the
evidence in any one branch, if interpreted rightly, will lead to cor-
rect conclusions, and if the conclusions drawn in one field conflict with
those drawn in another, it can only be because one or the other is
wrongly interpreted. It is not a question of balancing the evidence.
If it does not alZ point one way, then there is some mistake in the in-
terpretations placed on the facts. The problem then lies in finding
out what is the fallacy and in which field it lies, and whether the
evidence in several fields has been vitiated by the same fallacy. It
is only thus that one can arrive at true conclusions in problems of
this sort. To attempt to decide them by the balance of evidence,
as one would settle a problem in taxonomy, is more likely to put one
wrong than right.

Doctor Case’s volume is of interest as placing a novel and much
broader significance on the term paleogeography, making it almost
equivalent to what might be called paleoecology. He has little to
say in this volume as to the question of continental outlines, so com-
monly discussed as though it were the whole of the subject, but is con-
cerned chiefly with the habitat of the animals, its nature and changes,
and the physical geography of Permian North America.

There has been for the past two decades a tendency among verte-
bratists to keep more closely in touch with stratigraphic geology.
The comparative anatomist, especially in setting forth the evolution
and specialization of structures, tends to arrange his material in
categories and sequences that show the evolution of structures and
organs, but are of course structural and not genetic sequences, as the
288 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

animals are all contemporaneous. The paleontologist, however, is
dealing with true genetic sequences, exact or approximate; with the
evolution of species and genera of animals, not merely with illustra-
tions of how certain structures may have evolved. The time relations
of his specimens must be known exactly and carefully considered.
This has been always to the forefront in invertebrate paleontology.
Much of the early research in vertebrate paleontology, however, was
by men who were comparative anatomists rather than geologists, and
the fragmentary material with which they had to deal made a
thorough practical acquaintance with comparative osteology the first
essential. to its correct identification and study. It is no less import-
ant to-day on account of the complex structure of the vertebrate
skeleton; but an inevitable consequence is a certain tendency to take
the anatomist’s viewpoint and study too much the evolution of struc-
tures and not enough the actual sequence in time of the animals them-
selves. The corrective of this tendency is a closer union with the
geologists, and in the founding of our society it was hoped and ex-
pected that this would result. So far as I can see, the course of
American paleontology in the past two decades has demonstrated
the wisdom of this action. The exact records of specimens and more
careful stratigraphic studies have enabled us to define horizons and
differentiate faunas in much more precise and correct detail; and,
with the far larger collections and more complete specimens, the
records are adequate to trace in many cases the evolution of species
and not merely of structures. The earlier writers on evolution did
not attempt this. Gaudry and Heckel, Riitimeyer and Kowalewsky,
Huxley, and Cope demonstrated from the paleontologic record the
evolution of structure. Depéret and Schlosser, Osborn and Scott,
and many others have perceived and pointed out this weakness in
our evidence and have attempted to trace the true phyla. But it is
only recently that the evidence has been adequate to place such at-
tempts on a really sound and permanent basis, and indeed most of
our work in this line is still tentative and provisional. Neverthe-
less, we may expect to see these beginnings extended year by year,
and the old structural phylogenies elaborated by the previous gen-
eration, and scoffed at with some justice by critics as a vast “ schwin-
delbau,” replaced by the veritable records of the phyletic history of
races of animals. In so far as this is accomplished, Professor Mor-
gan’s strictures on paleontological evolution,®! which are aimed
really at the old methods, not at our modern standards, will be no
longer justified. Paleontologists, with the facts before them as to
what actually did take place in the evolution of a race of animals,
may claim the right to reason and draw conclusions from these data
as to the methods and causes of the transmutation of species.

51 See footnote 50,
VERTEBRATE PALEONTOLOGY—MATTHEW 289

On the anatomical side of paleontology, the far greater complete-
ness of our material in recent years has stimulated comparative re-
searches of high quality, apparent in many of the memoirs I have
cited and in a series of memoirs by Gregory, Watson, Broom, Willis-
ton, Case, and many others.

Taxonomic researches and revisions have by no means been ne-
glected, but I can mention only one of the many completed or in
progress, the revision by Miller and Gidley of the supergeneric
groups of rodents, in which, for the first time, the fossil representa-
tives of this order have received adequate treatment in a comprehen-
sive revision.

In looking over the apparent trend of recent advances I am im-
pressed with the honest and conscientious endeavor everywhere ap-
parent to provide a broader and more secure foundation of evidence
for our researches by much more extensive collections, more complete
specimens, and more exact records. We have tried to get into
closer touch with stratigraphic geology on one side, with compara-
tive anatomy and zoology on the other. We have, on the whole, I
think, kept fairly clear, considering the great increase in our collec-
tions, of the temptation to multiply species correspondingly, the be-
setting sin of the systematist; and, although the Mendelian school of
zoologists will have naught to do with us, we have succeeded, I
think, in making very good use of the data and viewpoints that they
have emphasized and incorporating them satisfactorily into our own
scheme of things.

By N. HOoLuisTEr

[With 29 plates]

The National Zoological Park, in the city of Washington, was
established by an act of Congress approved April 30, 1890, “ for the
advancement of science and the instruction and recreation of the
people,” and was placed under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution. Some changes have been made in the original boundary
line, and the area now included within the park comprises 175 acres.
The park is located in Rock Creek Valley, a district admirably and
peculiarly suited for the purposes for which it was selected.

At the time of its establishment the park was some distance from
the city proper, but now it is well within the residential district of
northwest Washington, almost surrounded by dwellings, and is easily
accessible from the heart of the city. No more beautiful site for a
zoological park could be desired, and within the fences of this pictur-
esque tract may be found conditions suitable for many of the forms of
animal life. The borders of the valley are heavily wooded, and the
vegetation in summer almost entirely shuts off the view of the sur-
rounding country. The more open hills and rolling slopes of the
interior, where most of the exhibition buildings are placed, are
covered with firm sod and excellent lawns, and winding through the
length of the valley is picturesque Rock Creek, an affluent of the
Potomac River. Systems of automobile roads and bridle paths are
maintained throughout the park and walks traverse its most fre-
quented parts.

A collection of about 1,750 living animals is, of course, the feature
of the park. There are numerous paddocks and ranges for buffalo,
deer, and other large mammals; lakes and pools for waterfowl, seals,
beavers, and other aquatic species; outdoor cages, some of large size,
for hardy birds and mammals; and houses and shelters for species
requiring special care or heated quarters during the winter months.
The lion house, near the center of the collection, is at the summit of
what is generally known as “lion house hill.” In this building are
most of the larger cats, the hyenas, the hippopotamuses, and some

291
2992 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

tropical mammals. Here also are most of the reptiles. Near by are
the monkey house and the bird house, and to the north the antelope
house, elephant house, and zebra house. Outdoor yards and cages
are placed throughout the park in situations favorable to the comfort
and health of the various species exhibited.

The interest of the public in the National Zoological Park is at-
tested by the number of visitors. Over two millions of people now
visit the park annually. In 1923 the attendance was 2,393,428, a
daily average of 6,558. A large share of the enormous number of
tourists to Washington visit the zoo and the sight-seeing cars now
regularly include the park in their itineraries. Many people are
attracted to the park on account of its walks and drives, and as the
entire area is a carefully protected sanctuary for wild birds and
flowers, many nature classes from the schools visit it on their field
excursions.

Three great classes of animals—mammals, birds, and reptiles—
are represented in the collections maintained in the National Zoo-
logical Park.

MAMMALS

The mammals (class Mammalia) comprise those creatures com-
monly known as “animals.” ‘They are usually distinguishable from
other vertebrates by numerous well-known superficial characters and
are briefly defined technically as warm-blooded vertebrates with
hair, and with glands in the female for the secretion of milk for the
nourishment of the young. Mammals offer a great range of variety
in size, general appearance, and mode of life. The elephant, whale,
mouse, shrew, and bat present examples showing extremes in bulk
and habit. The vast majority of the mammals usually exhibited in
zoological gardens belong to the subdivisions of the class known as
the ungulates (hoofed mammals), primates (apes, monkeys, and
lemurs), rodents (gnawing mammals), carnivores (flesh eaters), and
marsupials (pouched mammals). In the National Zoological Park
good collections of numerous species of these groups of mimmals
may be seen and studied to advantage. ey

THE UNGULATES, OR HOOFED MAMMALS

Modern systematic mammalogists divide the existing “ hoofed ani-
mals” into four orders—the Proboscidea (elephants), Hyracoidea
(hyraxes), Perissodactyla (horses, tapirs, and rhinoceroses), and the
Artiodactyla (cattle, sheep, antelopes, deer, camels, swine, and hip-
popotamuses). The Perissodactyla are called the “odd-toed” un-
gulates, and usually have an uneven number of toes; as the existing
horse with one functional toe, and the rhinoceros with three. The
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—-HOLLISTER 293

main axis of the foot passes through the third digit. The tapirs,
although having four toes on the forelimb, have only three behind.
The Artiodactyla are known as “even-toed” ungulates and have
either two or four toes on each foot. These include the true “ cloven-
hoofed ” animals.

The ungulates are important and popular mammals in zoological
parks and are peculiarly suitable for exhibition purposes because
many species can be shown in open yards or paddocks which ap-
proximate in many instances the natural surroundings inhabited
by the animals. No less than 50 species are usually shown in the
National Zoological Park, many of which are represented by small
breeding herds.

THE ELEPHANTS

There are many points of difference between the Indian elephant
(Llephas maximus) and the African elephant (Lowxodonta africana),
but the most conspicuous mark to separate them is the considerable
diversity in the size and shape of the ear, that of the African ele-
phant being much larger than the ear of the Asiatic species. Both
kinds are divisible into a number of forms, no less than 11 sub-
species of the African elephant having been recognized by one
authority. African elephants attain a greater bulk than their Asiatic
kindred, but are not commonly seen in shows or parks, almost all
the elephants exhibited in circuses being of the Indian species.

Closely allied to the elephant of British India is the elephant
of Sumatra (Hlephas sumatranus). Two young animals of this
species were purchased in 1919 by a number of the friends of the
children of Washington and donated to the Smithsonian Institution
for deposit in the park. At the time of their arrival they were 2
and 21% years old and were 42 and 45 inches high. They are
growing rapidly and are already great favorites with the children,
to whom they are known by their Malayan names of “ Hitam”
(black) and “ Kechil” (small).

The African elephant now on exhibition in the park was brought
from the Government Zoological Garden at Giza, Egypt, by head
keeper Blackburne in 1918. At the time of her arrival she weighed
875 pounds and measured only 4 feet 3 inches in height at the
shoulder. In 1923 the same measurement was 7 feet 6 inches. She
is known as “ Jumbina.” She was captured in the region of the
Blue Nile and is of the geographical race known as the Abyssinian
elephant (Loxodonta africana oxyotis). In “ Jumbina’s” house
will be seen a picture of the famous African elephant “ Jumbo,”
probably the largest elephant ever shown in capitivity, and a rep-
resentative of this same Abyssinian race. Near the picture is a
294 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

marked pole which shows graphically the great height of that enor-
mous elephant—nearly 11 feet at the shoulder. There are, however,
authentic records of wild African elephants of greater size than
Jumbo; the highest reliable record is of one which measured 11
feet 614 inches.

The tusks of elephants are: the incisor teeth and are the chief
source of commercial ivory. Some of the extinct elephants, as
the mastodon, had tusks in the lower as well as the upper jaws.
A single tusk of an East African bull elephant has been known to
weigh 235 pounds, but this, of course, is far in excess of the normal
weight even for a large animal. Heller says the average tusk
weight to-day for old wild bull elephants is not more than 40 pounds
for each tusk; but before the biggest males were shot off by the
professional ivory hunters the average was probably about 80 pounds.
Tusks of female elephants are much smaller and more slender than
those of males, but sometimes grow to a great length.

THE TAPIRS

The Brazilian tapir (Zapirus terrestris) has been most success-
fully kept in the Zoological Park and no less than nine young have
been reared from a single pair that lived here for many years.
Strange to say, this tapir lives equally as well in outdoor yards
with warm but unheated quarters as in heated buildings. One
fine specimen has withstood the winter weather of Washington since
1911, appears quite unmindful of the cold, and is in perfect condi-
tion. It is not at all unusual in winter to see him out enjoying him-
self in the snow when other animals, even those from temperate or
colder climates, have retired to their shelters.

The Malay, or saddle-backed tapir (Zapirus indicus) is a strik-
ingly marked species native to the Malay Peninsula, Java, and
Sumatra. The back and sides are whitish, sharply set off from the
otherwise blackish body. This apparently conspicuous marking is
said to have great protective value, since the animal inhabits gray-
boulder-strewn wooded regions where the tiger is often its most
persistent foe. When lying quietly it is easily overlooked among the
boulders.

Young tapirs are pretty little creatures with stripes and spots of
yellowish white which gradually disappear during the first eight
months after birth.

Other species of tapir are found in the forests of western South
America and in Central America north to southern Mexico. The
Brazilian species is especially fond of water and spends much of its
time in marshy places.

THE HORSE AND HIS KINDRED

The Przewalski’s horse (E'quus przewalskiz) is the only living
species of truly wild horse. It inhabits the Gobi Desert region of
central Asia where living specimens were captured by an expedition
organized by Hagenbeck in 1900. The descendants of this stock are
now exhibited in zoological gardens in many parts of the world. In
his long shaggy winter coat this horse is a creature of striking ap-
pearance. On the outlying borders of the Gobi many of the horses
owned by the Kirghiz tribes are apparently mixed with the blood
of wild stock.

The specimen of the common East African zebra (Hquus quagga
granti) was brought from Nairobi, British East Africa, in 1909 by
Mr. A. B. Baker. He was then a young animal about 18 months old.
Zebras are found over much of southern and eastern Africa and in
certain localities are very abundant, living in great herds and ming-
ling freely with various species of antelopes and other game. They
are much preyed upon by the lion and are a favorite food of the
natives.

Grevy’s zebra (H'quus grevyz), a considerably larger and more
closely striped species than the common zebra, is confined to the
more arid parts of northeastern Africa, es ,ecially Abyssinia, Somali-
land, and northern British East Africa. It has a much longer and
narrower head than the common zebra and is a more handsome
animal. The male in the park weighs 880 pounds. The first speci-
men to reach the park was presented to President Roosevelt by
Emperor Menelik of Abyssinia in 1904.

THE RHINOCEROS

Of the five existing species of rhinoceros, three are confined to
southern Asia, including some of the larger islands, and two to
Africa. The black rhinoceros (Diceros bicornis), which is the spe-
cies on exhibition in the park, is found in Ethiopian Africa. The
young example shown came from Rhodesia in 1923, and was then
about 1 year old. The horns of rhinoceroses are not comparable to
the horns of deer, sheep, and other ruminants, but are outgrowths
of the skin and are not definitely connected with the bones of the
skull. Rhinoceroses grow to great size; a specimen of the black spe-
cies shot in Africa by Roosevelt measured 12 feet 3 inches in length.
of head and body, with the tail 30 inches long. The white rhinoceros
of Africa and one of the Indian species are known to exceed these
measurements.

THE HIPPOPOTAMUS

Remains of fossil hippopotamuses are found in various parts of
Asia and Europe, even in England, but the existing species are
296 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

confined to Africa. In addition to the several geographic races of
the common species (/Zippopotamus amphibius), a smaller kind, the
pigmy hippo, is known. This latter is confined to western Africa
and is very rare in collections. Hippos are essentially aquatic ani-
mals and swim with ease. It is said that they remain beneath the
surface of the water for so long a time as 10 minutes. On several
occasions the introduction of the hippopotamus into the rivers and
lakes of the southern United States has been advocated with the
expectation that the animal would successfully rid the waters of
the congested aquatic vegetation. In view of the serious depredations
upon planters’ crops which might well be expected, the advisability
of such an experiment is questionable.

Of the hippos living in the park, the female and older animal
was obtained from British East Africa in 1911. She was then
about 2 years old and weighed 800 pounds. She has grown greatly
since her arrival and now weighs about 5,000 pounds. She is gentle
and loves attention from her keepers. The male hippo came from
German East Africa in 1914 and is a much less perfectly tempered
animal. He is active and remarkably agile for a beast of his great
bulk and can turn and charge with great speed. Three young have
been successfully reared from this pair. At birth they weigh
about 45 pounds and are expert swimmers. The hippos are quartered
in the lion house, where they have access in summer to large out-
door yards and a tank. In winter they are furnished with heated
water for their bath and frequently cause great commotion by their
vigorous splashing.

THE WILD SWINE

The wild boar of Europe (Sus scrofa) typifies the family of
swine. It is presumably the ancestral form of the domestic races.
A fine example is shown in a yard near the elephant house. The
wart hog of Africa (Phacocherus ethiopicus) is famous for his
ugly appearance and huge tusks.

The American representatives of the pig family, the peccaries,
are found wild from Texas southward over much of Middle and
South America. Two general types are distinguished, the white-
lipped and the collared peccaries. The latter ranges farther to the
north than the larger white-lipped group and was formerly common
in the United States along the Mexican border. Although peccaries
are doubtless at times, especially when roving in large packs, dan-
gerous beasts to encounter, the stories told of their ferocity are often
greatly exaggerated. The collared peccary of Texas (Pecari angula-
tus) has frequently bred in the National Zoological Park.
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 297

THE CAMEL TRIBE

Whether any of the wild camels of Central Asia are really native
wild animals or not is a moot question. Many naturalists believe
that the Bactrian or two-humped camels now found in a wild state
in remote parts are merely the feral descendants of stray domestic
animals, after the manner of the wild Spanish horses formerly
occurring in the southwestern United States. Camels are popularly.
associated with hot barren deserts, but the two-humped camel
(Camelus bactrianus) is used in great numbers on the bleak steppes
of Siberia, where the temperature at times is anything but moderate.
Great caravans of these famous beasts of burden carry the rough
felt and other products of the desert tribes and Mongolians north-
ward to the Siberian Railway. The specimens of this species kept
in the park are much more hardy than the Arabian camels.

The dromedary, or Arabian camel (Camelus dromedarius), 1s the
species so much used as a pack and saddle animal in northern Africa.
A drove of 75 camels of this species was introduced by the United
States Government from Smyrna into the Southwestern States in
1856, and others were obtained 10 years later. Escaped animals
from these introductions frequented the Arizona deserts in a wild
state up to about 1893, when the last survivors were killed. Both
species of camels have bred in the park.

From the evidence provided by fossil remains, America was at
one time inhabited by many camels and camel-like animals, which
occupied the country even so far to the north as the arctic portions
of Alaska. The sole remaining species are the forms of the genus
Lama found in South America.

The wild llama, or guanaco (Lama guanicoe) is found in herds
from Ecuador to southern South America and ranges from sea level
in Patagonia to high altitudes in the Andes. It differs conspicuously
from the Old World camels in its small size and the absence of
humps on the back. It was early domesticated by the natives of
South America and two general types or breeds have been evolved—
the domestic llama, kept chiefly as a beast of burden; and the alpaca,
bred for its wool-like coat. The wild guanacos are of uniform
coloration, but the domestic llama and alpaca are variegated brown,
white, and black, or of solid colors.

All of the forms of the llama breed freely in the National Zoologi-
cal Park, and the young are graceful, attractive animals, much ad-
mired by visitors. «

The vicufia (Zama vicugna) is a smaller species than the guanaco,
with a distribution limited to the higher Andes of Bolivia, Ecuador,
and Peru. It has never been domesticated, but the animals in the
park have been gentle and do not seem to suffer from confinement
298 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

in small yards. With the llama already in use and bred into differ-
ent varieties, there was little reason for special effort by the natives
to add this high mountain species to their list of domestic stock.

THE DEER PADDOCKS

No less than 15 species of the deer family (Cervide) are usually
shown in the National Zoological Park. Deer are attractive exhibi-
tion animals and with proper care do very well in captivity. It is
often possible to show small breeding herds in large open paddocks,
where the animals present a natural and pleasing appearance.

The members of the deer family are of special interest to sports-
men, and to the average visitor are a never ceasing source of wonder
on account of the annual shedding of the antlers. These antlers are
present in the males of most of the species of true Cervide, and are
well developed in the females of the caribou and reindeer. They are
dropped annually after the rutting season, and during renewal are
covered with the “ velvet ” which is later worn off when the antlers
are polished by the animals’ rubbing them against trees and rocks.
The growth of the new antlers is astonishingly rapid, and in Siberia
the maral, or native elk, is kept in large numbers for the antlers
alone. These are sawed off while in the velvet and shipped in great
quantities to Mongolia and China, where they bring good prices for
medicinal purposes.

The most stately and conspicuous of the American deer is the
wapiti, or American elk (Cervus canadensis). Although less in size
than the moose, he is of more graceful and handsome proportions.
This fine animal once ranged over much of the United States, but
is now restricted to a few localities where the species has been care-
fully preserved. The greatest numbers are to be found in the
Yellowstone National Park and the surrounding country, whence
numbers have in recent years been shipped into several Eastern
States which were, years ago, inhabited by the species. The elk
range in the Zoological Park is situated along the eastern border,
between Rock Creek and the boundary fence. The animals breed
freely in this place and are maintained in splendid condition.

Near relatives of the American elk are the Bedford, or Manchu-
rian stag (Cervus wanthopygus), the Kashmir deer (C. hanglu),
and the red deer of Europe (C. elaphus). These are all represented
in the park by fine breeding herds. The Bedford deer and the Kash-
mir deer were presented to the park by the Duke of Bedford from his
herds at Woburn Abbey, England.

The common white-tailed, or Virginia deer (Odocotleus virgini-
anus), the mule deer (O. hemionus) of the Rocky Mountain region
and the black-tailed deer of the Pacific coast (O. columbianus) all do
well in the park, and breeding herds are shown in large, open yards.
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 299

The Virginia deer is probably the best known big game animal in
the United States. It ranges, in some of its geographical forms, from
New Brunswick to South America. In addition to the common form
of the eastern United States, one of the tropical species, the beautiful
Panama deer (O. chiriquensis), is on exhibition. It is greatly to be
regretted that the quarantine regulations now in force against hoofed
mammals from South America make it virtually impossible to import
and exhibit any of the remarkable and characteristic species of deer
native to that country. These are of types very different from the
deer of other lands and should be shown in the park.

Among the Old World kinds none are more beautiful and attrac-
tive than the fallow deer (Dama dama). These deer are spotted in
summer, but the winter coat is of uniform color; the antlers are
comparatively large and somewhat flattened or palmate. This species
is a native of the Mediterranean region, but has long been introduced
in western Europe where it lives in a wild or semidomestic state.
Blackish and light colored varieties have been bred, and specimens
of the former are usually to be seen in the park herd.

The axis deer or chital (Aas axis) is spotted at all seasons. It
is a native of India and a closely related form is known from Ceylon.
The antlers of this deer are long, slender, and of three tines—a
prominent brow tine and one fork above. Another spotted oriental
species shown is the hog deer (Hyelaphus porcinus). 'This is a more
sturdy species than the axis, but is only about 26 inches high at the
shoulder.

The large group of oriental deer known as the rusine species is
represented in the park by the sambar (Husa unicolor). Numerous
species of Husa occur throughout southeastern Asia and on many of
the East Indian Islands. Most of the larger islands of the Philip-
pine Archipelago have their distinct species, sometimes two. The
antlers are normally stout and of three tines, but in some species are
very small and with elongated pedicles.

The park possesses a fine herd of the barasingha, or swamp deer of
India (Rucervus dwvaucelit). This striking species thrives in the
large paddocks provided for it. Its antlers are large, sweeping, and
many-tined. A near relative is the Burmese deer (2. eldii). The
little Japanese deer (Sika nippon), one of the most satisfactory
species for park purposes, also is shown.

A small herd of reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), imported from
Norway, may be seen in a large paddock near the buffalo range.
These deer are particularly interesting because of the fact that both
sexes grow antlers. ‘The American representative of the reindeer is
the caribou, found in the northern parts of the continent.
300 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923
THE ANTELOPES

Asia. and Africa are the present-day homes of a great group of
bovine animals known as the antelopes. In Africa, especially, this
group offers the most astonishing diversity and the species range in
size from the tiny dik-dik to the giant eland. There are brilliantly
colored forest species and plain colored desert forms; solitary species
and others which graze in great herds. Frequently these herds are
composed of animals representing a number of distinct genera. The
true antelopes, like the cattle, have hollow horns which grow and are
retained throughout life—as opposed to the solid, deciduous antlers
of the members of the deer family.

Among the African antelopes in the park are the great, gentlefaced
Kast African eland (Zaurotragus oryx livingstonit), first presented
by the Duke of Bedford, and now regularly breeding; the sable ante-
lope (Z'gocerus niger), with his long, bowed horns, and the beautiful
blesbok (Damaliscus albifrons), both of South Africa; the lechwe
(Onotragus leche), related to the water buck; the rather spectacular
and very noisy wildebeest or white-tailed gnu (Connochetes gnou),
and his much rarer relative, the brindled gnu (C. taurinus). With
the exception of the elands, which have large paddocks to the north
of the elephants, all of these African species are kept in the antelope
house, where such as need them have heated quarters in winter and
all have pleasant yards for summer range.

The Asiatic antelopes shown include the fine, large species known
as the nilgai (Boselaphus traqgocamelus) and the small black buck
(Antilope cervicapra). Both of these species are restricted to pen-
insular India. The females of each are without horns and differ
markedly in color from the males. The black bucks thrive in the
National Zoological Park in outdoor paddocks with unheated shelter,
and both species regularly breed.

The American antelope or pronghorn (Antilocapra americana)
belongs to a separate family. It was formerly abundant on the west-
ern plains, but is now found in only a few scattered localities. ‘This
animal differs considerably from the true antelopes. The horns are
shed annually, only the bony core persisting throughout life. 'The
pronghorn is especially hard to keep in eastern zoological gardens
and specimens are not always on exhibition in Washington. It is a
matter of great satisfaction that one example was kept in the park
for so long a period as five years.

GOATS AND SHEEP

Goats and sheep are native to many sections of the northern parts
of both hemispheres, and many and diverse wild species are known.
They are closely related, and forms of each have long been domesti-
cated and bred along lines of most utility.
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 801

The Alpine ibex (Capra ibex) was formerly common in the
mountainous parts of central Europe, but is now rare over much of
its former range. Related forms are found in the mountains of
Spain, northern Africa, and eastward to central Asia.

The tahr (Hemitragus jemlahicus) of the Himalayas and the
aoudad, or Barbary sheep (Ammotragus lervia) of northern Africa,
are species which connect in many features the true goats with the
sheep and make it difficult to draw a sharp distinction between the
groups. The male tahr is an animal of striking appearance, with his
heavy collar and mane of long, shaggy hair reaching to his knees.
He is an animal of the forested mountains and an exceptional climber
and jumper. The aoudad is another animal that attracts great at-
tention in the Zoo. Although lacking the regular beard of the goat,
he has extraordinarily developed hair on the neck and fore limbs,
and an upright mane extending to near the middle of his back.
The aoudad is also at home on the steep slopes that are included
within his paddocks.

The Rocky Mountain sheep, or bighorn, which is known in some
of its geographical forms in western North America from Alaska
to Mexico is well represented in the park by five specimens of the
typical form (Ovis canadensis) received from the Dominion parks
branch of the Canadian Government. These sheep came from the
protected area included wit’1in the Rocky Mountains Park and were
shipped from Banff, Alberta. Several young have been reared. The
Arizona race (0. c. gaillardi) is also shown.

One of the most beautiful of wild sheep on exhibition is the
mouflon (O. musimon), native to Corsica and Sardinia. It is much
smaller than the American wild sheep and is even smaller than a
good-sized domestic sheep, but it is a trim creature and is handsomely
marked.

ROCKY MOUNTAIN GOAT

The Rocky Mountain goat (Oreamnos americanus), which is still
common in parts of Alberta and British Columbia, was formerly
abundant in the rugged mountains from Alaska to Washington,
Idaho, and Montana. It is one of the most peculiar of American
big game animals and has no nearer living relatives than the
chamois, serow, goral, and takin, all found in the Old World. The
hair is white or creamy white, and in the winter grows long and
shaggy. The horns, which average longest in the female, are shiny
black with smooth, sharp tips. Mountain goats are not especially
alert, and are easily stalked, but their natural range is in the most
difficult mountains and a successful hunt usually requires time and
endurance. The mountain goats on exhibition were presented by
3802 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

the Canadian Government and came from Banff, Alberta. Several
young have been born in the park.

THE MUSK OX

Specimens of the Greenland musk ox (Ovibos moschatus wardt)
were first received at the National Zoological Park in 1922. The
musk ox is now found only in the barren Canadian Arctic and in
Greenland, but, as shown by its fossil and sub-fossil remains, it
formerly inhabited Alaska and northern Europe and Asia. Its
range has been greatly restricted within historic times, great num-
bers of the animals having been killed by explorers of the North.
Present-day protection by the Canadian and Danish Governments
will doubtless save the species from actual extermination, and plans
are even being made to attempt the semidomestication of some of
the remaining herds*for commercial purposes. Owing to the nature
of the animal its protection should not be difficult, and it should
prove a valuable addition to the domestic animals of the northern
treeless wastes. The musk ox is usually considered the only repre-
sentative of a special subfamily of bovine animals.

BISON, YAK, AND THEIR ALLIES

The herd of American bison (Bison bison) maintained in the
National Zoological Park has been brought together from various
sources. It is now kept at approximately 17 head, and the surplus
stock is exchanged to other parks and bison reservations. There are
now many places where bison herds are kept and carefully protected
and bred so that all danger of the extinction of this famous Ameri-
can ruminant is past. The number of animals is increasing yearly
under the direction of the American and Canadian Governments
and the American Bison Society; new herds and reservations to
accommodate the surplus animals have been created.

The yak (Poéphagus grunniens) is found in a wild state in the
very high mountains of central Asia, in Ladak, Tibet, and Kan-su,
where it lives at altitudes varying from 14,000 to 20,000 feet. The
color of the wild stock is a blackish brown. Tame, semiwild, and
feral herds ranging northward into the Altai Mountains at much
lower altitudes, even to the Siberian slopes of the Little Altai, are
of mixed colors, black, brown, gray, and white. Both sexes nor-
mally have horns; those of the male ofttimes are of great length.
The natives of central Asia say that the yak is not successfully
kept below 4,000 feet in that region. The animals in the Zoological
Park, at what is practically sea level, do not seem to suffer from the
low altitude, and frequently breed.
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 303

The Indian water buffalo (Bubalus bubalis) has been domesticated
and introduced into southern Europe, parts of Africa, eastern Asia,
and many of the East Indian islands. The examples on exhibition
came from the Philippine Islands, where the animal is called the
carabao, and is in quite general use. This buffalo sometimes grows
to an immense size, and specimens have been reported that were as
high at 614 feet at the shoulder. The horns vary in the several wild
races and domestic breeds and are sometimes very large, curved in
a crescentic form, or directed widely outward, when they may meas-
ure nearly 6 feet from tip to tip. In the British Museum is a pair
of horns which measure 77% inches in length. Smaller related spe-
cies are native to Celebes and Mindoro.

THE PRIMATES

The order of mammals known as the Primates includes the lemurs,
monkeys, apes, and man. The lemurs are mostly nocturnal animals
and are, so far as living forms are concerned, not closely related to
the other Primates. In some species the tail is very long; in others
it is wanting entirely. In the present age the lemurs are confined to
Africa, the oriental region, and to Madagascar and neighboring |
islands. Many of the species are confined to the latter region.

The other Primates are usually divided into several families. The
principal groups are the marmosets, small species often of brilliant
coloration and silky coat, confined to tropical America; the remain-
ing American monkeys, of great variety in size and characteristics,
and of an uncertain number of families; the Old World monkeys, all
rather closely related as compared with the great diversity shown by
the American species; the anthropoid apes, including the gorilla,
orang-utan, chimpanzee, and gibbon; and finally man.

While the majority of the Primates kept in the park are exhibited
in the monkey house, several outdoor yards and shelters are pro-
vided for such species as endure our winters without heated quar-
ters, and the chimpanzee and the orang-utan make their winter
homes in a specially prepared corner of the lion house.

THE GREAT APES

Of the four anthropoid apes, gorilla, chimpanzee, orang-utan, and
gibbon, all but the first named have been represented in the park
collection. No animal in the park attracts more attention from
visitors than “Soko,” the chimpanzee (Pan satyrus). “Soko”
reached the park in September, 1915, from the forests of the French
Kongo. He was then about 314 years old and weighed only 38
pounds. During the autumn of 1916, or when about 414 years old,
he lost his milk teeth, and since the permanent teeth have developed
304 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

his growth has been much more rapid than before. On September
1, 1918, he weighed 85 pounds, and in 1923 his weight was about 120
pounds. While still a young animal he was taught by his keepers
to take his formal meals seated at a table, and this he did daily up
to recently, much to the joy of the children who crowded about his
cage. Although still very good tempered, he has grown too power-
ful to be trusted with safety and his training has been discontinued.
“Soko” does all sorts of unexpected tricks and is a creature of
extreme moods. At times he is very grave and serious, and again,
especially if he has an appreciative audience, he is bubbling over
with the joy of life and spins round and round on his back and
shoulders or turns somersaults repeatedly. The chimpanzee is
found only in the forested areas of Central Africa, from the western
coast eastward to the region of the great lakes. A number of dif-
ferent forms are recognized by naturalists.

OLD WORLD MONKEYS

With few exceptions the Old World monkeys are all exhibited in
the building known as the monkey house. The exceptions are hardy
species which seem unmindful of our coldest winter weather and
thrive in unheated outdoor cages, where they are provided of course
with snug and comfortable sleeping quarters. These “ fresh-air”
monkeys include the Barbary ape (Stmia sylvanus) of northern
Africa and Gibraltar; the rhesus monkey (Macaca rhesus), a social
species of northern India; the brown macaque (Jfacaca speciosa), of
Upper Burma and Cochin China, in which the tail is nearly obso-
lete; the Japanese monkey (Macaca fuscata), a long-furred, naked-
face, short-tailed species; and the chacma (Papio porcarius), a
South African baboon of large size and great strength. A full
grown male of this powerful baboon is said to be a match for a
leopard; and as the animals usually live in troops, so great a num-
ber as 100 being sometimes associated in this manner, they at times
are responsible for great depredations to crops, and have been known
to kill lambs and other stock.

In the monkey house and the annexed outdoor yards for summer
use are shown a variety of the Old World species. A number of
forms of macaques, related to those mentioned above, are usually
here. These include the bonnet monkey (A/acaca sinica), a native
of southern India; the pig-tailed monkey (/. nemestrina) of the
Malay region; the Burmese macaque (J/. andamanensis) ; the Moor
macaque (Cynopithecus maurus) from Celebes; and others. The
mangabeys, a tropical African group of long-tailed, forest-loving
monkeys, are represented by the sooty mangabey (Cercocebus fuli-
ginosus), an obscurely colored but very active species; the black
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISPER 305

mangabey (C. aterrimus) ; Hagenbeck’s mangabey (C. hagenbecki) ;
and the white-collared species (C. torquatus).

The guenons form the largest group of the Primates and exhibit
remarkable diversity in coloration and color pattern. They are
attractive and very interesting monkeys with slender bodies and
long limbs and tails. Some of the species are oddly and brilliantly
colored. The group includes about 80 forms and is native to Africa;
but two species (the mona and the green guenon) have been intro-
duced into the West Indies and are perfectly established on some
of the islands. Attractive species of this genus shown in the monkey
house are the mona (Lasiopyga mona), the vervet (L. pygerythra),
the green monkey (ZL. callitrichus), and the roloway (L. roloway),
the latter an especially beautiful form with glossy, blackish coat and
a long, white beard. The patas monkeys (Z'rythrocebus patas) are
near relatives of the guenons but are larger animals, more at home
on the open country than in the forests. The general coloration is
red.

Baboons shown, in addition to the chacma, mentioned above, are the
yellow baboon (Papio cynocephalus) of northern Africa; the Hama-
dryas baboon (P. hamadryas), a large, powerful Abyssinian species
which lives in herds of up to 300 in number in the rocky, waste
country; the mandrill (P. sphinw), a West African species with an
enormous head and long snout; and the drill (P. leucophwus) of
Cameroon. An albino specimen of the East African baboon (P.
ibeanus) attracts great attention. It was purchased in Mombasa in
1914 by Mr. H. N. Sclater, who presented it to the park.

AMERICAN MONKEYS

The American monkeys and marmosets are of great variety and
are found throughout most of tropical America, north into Mexico.
In parts of equatorial South America many species occur in the
heavily forested river valleys. They are, unfortunately, much more
difficult to keep in captivity than are most of the Old World
monkeys, and only a few species are successfully maintained in
zoological gardens. The capuchins, the exception to the rule, are the
commonest hand-organ monkeys and are familiar to all. Three
species of these are regularly shown, the white-throated capuchin
(Cebus capucinus), the brown capuchin (C. fatuellus), and the
weeping capuchin (C@. apella). Geographical races of the first range
northward into Nicaragua. Among the many rare and unusual ani-
mals collected by the Mulford Biological Explorations of the Ama-
zon Basin, and presented to the park in 1922, are two additional
species, the pale capuchin (C@. wnicolor) and Azara’s capuchin (C.
azare@), both from Bolivia.
806 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

The spider monkeys are remarkable for the highly developed pre-
hensile tail, which is constantly used as a fifth hand. They are
among the most perfectly arboreal of mammals and exhibit the great-
est agility in their movements throughout the tree tops. Numerous
species are known and the range of the genus extends northward
well into Mexico. The species most commonly exhibited in the park
is the gray spider monkey (Ateles geoffroyt). Various species of
squirrel monkeys and marmosets are shown from time to time.

THE LEMURS

Although several groups of lemurs are known from Africa and
the oriental region, the species included within the typical genus
Lemur, and known as “true lemurs,” are confined to Madagascar
and neighboring islands. They have a foxlike face and muzzle and
a long tail. The numerous species are essentially arboreal and many
of them are strikingly colored. The mongoose lemur (Lemur
mongoz) is a noisy, gregarious species, noted for its agility in trees.
In addition to this species, the black lemur (Lemur macaco) and
the fulvous lemur (Z. fulvus) are shown.

THE GNAWING MAMMALS

Among the gnawing mammals are included two very distinct
orders—the Rodentia and the Lagomorpha. The latter order is made
up of the hares, rabbits, and pikas, while all the other existing rodent-
like forms are members of the order Rodentia. The vast majority
of rodents are small creatures, like the mice, rats, and squirrels; but
the order includes some very sizable living animals—the porcupine,
beaver, and capybara, while an extinct South American member of
the group was as large as a hippopotamus. The most characteristic
features of the Rodentia are the complete absence of canine teeth and
the great development of the incisors which, owing to their per-
sistent growth and the presence of hard enamel chiefly on the an-
terior surface, are worn by use to a chisel-like edge. There is always
a considerable space on the jaw between these cutting teeth and the
molariform grinders.

Until some special means for the exhibition of living examples of
the smaller rodents and lagomorphs can be devised, the collection
must be mainly restricted to the larger forms. The common gray
squirrel and the cottontail rabbit roam wild within the borders of
the park. Among the gray squirrels will be seen numerous black or
blackish examples. These are descendants of black squirrel stock in-
troduced in the park a number of years ago from southern Ontario.
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 307

Other members of the squirrel family shown are the prairie dog
(Cynomys ludovicianus) and various species of ground squirrels and
marmots. The prairie dogs have an inclosed area near the eland
yards where they live the social village life so characteristic of the
species. Numbers of young are born and reared each year. During
the coldest winter weather the prairie dogs hibernate, but in nice
weather they are always to be seen about the “ dog town.”

Two aquatic rodents, the American beaver (Castor canadensis) and
the coypu (Myocastor coypus) of South America enjoy the running
stream above the sea lion pool. The beavers have an extensive yard
and have dammed the stream in true beaver fashion so that the
resulting lake offers them the most natural surroundings. They are
best seen in the late afternoon. The coypu, or nutria, is thoroughly
at home in the water, and the teats of the female are placed high
on the side of the back so that the young are able to nurse without
diving. The fur is valuable for many purposes but is chiefly cut and
used in the manufacture of hats. As many as 500,000 skins have been
exported from South America within a single year.

The African porcupine (Hystrix africwaustralis) and the Malay
porcupine (Acanthion brachyurum) are splendid species with quills
_ far longer than those of the American porcupines.

Among the attractive rodents found only in tropical America
are the families Caviide, Dasyproctide, and Chinchillide. Many
species are peculiarly adapted to zoological park life, are showy
animals, and breed regularly in captivity. The guinea pig (Cavia
porcellus), so familiar to children, is bred in large numbers. The
paca (Cuniculus paca), one of the larger rodents, has a brown body
well marked with whitish spots. He is related to the agouti
(Dasyprocta) of which a number of species are regularly kept.
Some of the species of agouti are brilliantly marked; a most strik-
ing species is the hairy-rumped agouti (D. prymnolopha). One of
the most beautiful forms, the Trinidad agouti (D. rubrata), first re-
ceived from Hon. Henry D. Baker, has twice bred in the park.
Agoutis range north into Mexico and on several of the West Indian
islands. They are hunted with dogs by the natives, and are said
to be almost as cunning as a fox. Eight species of agouti were on
exhibition at one time in 1923.

The capybara (Hydrocherus hydrocheris) is a native of South
America, north to Panama. This species is very fond of marshy
tracts and is an expert swimmer. The specimens now on exhibition
were received from Venezuela and British Guiana. Capybaras
sometimes grow to more than 4 feet in length; they are thick-set ani-
mals and although easily the largest of the existing rodents are
gentle, inoffensive, and easily tamed.
308 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923
THE CARNIVOROUS MAMMALS

Two distinct orders of this group are now recognized by mam-
malogists. The Carnivora proper, or Fissipedia, include the
families of cats, civets, hyenas, dogs, raccoons, weasels, and bears,
with their allies. The order Pinnipedia is comprised of the seals,
sea lions, and walrus. While there is immense variety in the denti-
tion of carnivorous mammals, as a rule the teeth are highly devel- °
oped for the process of tearing and cutting flesh or the crushing
of bone. Some species are far from “carnivorous,” and subsist
chiefly upon fruits and insects. The black and brown bears are good
examples of this latter type, but most carnivores do at times eat more
or less of vegetable food. Some of the smaller species are largely
insectivorous.

The largest of living carnivores is the great brown bear of Kadiak
Island, Alaska; the smallest, the least weasel of the boreal regions
of both continents.

The Pinnipedia are readily divided into groups typified by the
hair seals or harbor seals, the sea lions, and the walrus. The hair
seals have no external ears and the hind limbs are so placed and
modified as to be useless for walking on land. The feet, or hind
“ flippers,” protrude backward and are used in the nature of a tail
in swimming. The common harbor seals of both coasts belong to
this group. The sea lions, or sea bears, have external ears, and the
hind limbs are functional for walking on land. This group includes
the famous fur seal as well as the species of sea lions. Peculiarities
of the skeleton point to a very ancient separation of these two groups
of seals, and they are not so closely related as would appear from
their external appearance and habits.

THE CATS

Specimens of the larger members of the cat tribe are usually kept
in all menageries and are favorite animals with the public. The
collection in the National Zoological Park includes beautiful exam-
ples of many of the most interesting and showy species. The larger
kinds are shown in the lion house.

The African lion (Felis leo) ranks foremost in popular interest.
The adult male is a magnificent beast with massive head, a full mane,
and a long tufted tail; he presents a most imposing appearance.
Lions thrive in captivity and develop much finer manes of softer,
more luxuriant hair on the neck and shoulders than is usual in wild
animals. Lions broaght from the high and comparatively dry
plateaus of East Africa develop much darker coats in the Zoological
Park than in a natural state, This is supposed to be due to the more

humid atmosphere of Washington. The mane of the lion is not
fully developed until the animal has reached a very mature age,
and the numerous “adult” lons without manes shot by sportsmen
prove to be in reality fully grown but immature animals. In the
series of over 100 lions preserved in the National Museum the full-
sized but maneless males are invariably the younger ones, as shown
by the condition of the sutures of the skull and the condition of the
teeth. The mane grows much more rapidly in park specimens and
appears fully developed at an age when wild lions would still be
““maneless.” Numerous geographical races of the lion are known,
and the range of the animal extends into western India. Within
historic times the species was wild in southeastern Europe.

The tiger, the lion’s rival in size, strength, and popular interest,
is an inhabitant of Asia, where it ranges through its various forms
from southern Siberia to Java and Bali, and westward to Persia.
It is absent from the greater part of the highlands of the central
parts of the continent but has been killed so far north as Sakhalin
Island on the coast and the northern slopes of the Altai in central
southern Siberia. It is best known from Korea and Manchuria,
the Amoy region of eastern China, Malaya, and India, each region
furnishing a special type. The Bengal tiger (els tigris) is the
best known form in menageries. It has a short coat and is a very
inferior animal to the splendid Manchurian tiger of the north (Felis
tigris longipilis). 'The Manchurian tiger is common in parts of
Korea where it is usually hunted on the snow in winter. Both the
Bengal and Manchurian tigers are represented in the Zoological
Park collection of the great cats, and the numerous points of differ-
ence between these two forms are readily seen. The most beautiful
of all the tigers, the Amoy species, has never been shown; although
skins regularly reach the market, living specimens are rarely ob-
tainable. The same may be said of the very distinct Persian form.
The Malay and Sumatra tigers are frequently seen in zoological
gardens and specimens of the former lived for many years in the
National Zoological Park.

The leopard (Felis pardus) of Asia and Africa and the jaguar
(Felis onca) of America are spotted cats with many superficial
points of resemblance. The leopard is a less stocky animal than the
jaguar, though he exceeds in size many of the smaller specimens of
the American species. Like the lion and the tiger the leopard is
divided into several subspecies or geographical races. Both the
African and Asiatic forms are kept in the park. The jaguar ranges
from Argentina northward to Mexico, and is sometimes killed in
the wilder parts of Texas and New Mexico. Unlike the puma, or
mountain lion, it is at times very destructive to cattle. The smallest

1454—25——21
310 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

jaguars come from northern South America and the largest form
inhabits Paraguay and southern Brazil. The great difference in
size between specimens from these two regions is remarkable. Skulls
of adult male specimens of the Paraguay jaguar exceed in measure-
ments the skull of the largest Korean tigress recorded. _

The snow leopard (felis uncia) is one of the most beautiful of
the larger cats. It inhabits the mountains of central Asia. The
specimen on exhibition in the park lives without artificial heat the
year around and enjoys the colder winter weather.

The puma, known in the Western States as the mountain lion
and in the south as the panther, has an extensive distribution from
British Columbia to Patagonia. It was formerly common in the
Eastern States, but is now exterminated over much of its original
range. In parts of Florida and especially in the canebrake regions
of Louisiana, panthers are still found. In the Bear Lake cane of
northeastern Louisiana the animal was almost common a few years
ago and doubtless is frequently found to this day. The mountain
lion of the Rockies (Felis hippolestes) and the paler colored form
from Arizona (Felis azteca) are both exhibited in the park. In
parts of the West and Southwest the mountain lion is still found
in numbers, and in particular localities is so destructive to colts that
it is almost impossible to raise horses on the open range. ‘There are
several authentic instances of the mountain lion’s attacking man
without the slightest provocation; but considering the wide distribu-
tion of the animal and its comparative abundance, these must be
considered exceptional traits of habit.

The ocelot (Felis pardalis) is a smaller spotted and blotched
American cat, common in the Tropics and regularly found in south-
eastern Texas. It is a handsome species which varies greatly in color
and markings. The Canada lynx (Lynx canadensis) is a larger,
tufted-eared relative of the common bobcat, or wildcat, of the
United States. It is found over much of the wooded parts of
British America and Alaska and into the Northern States and
Rocky Mountain region of the West. It is much sought by the
trapper and during the periodical abundance of the northern hare
becomes very plentiful, so that large numbers are captured.

The bay lynx, or bobcat (Lynx rufus), is the wildcat com-
monly found in unsettled portions of the United States. Like other
species of wide distribution it is divisible into numerous geographical
forms. One of the handsomest of these is a richly colored race from
the humid coast region of the Northwestern States.

The clouded leopard (NVeofelis nebulosa) is another of the more
handsome cats. It is smaller than the snow leopard, but is quite as
beautifully marked. It lacks the fine form of the head and face of
the snow leopard, however, and belongs in a separate genus. The
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK——-HOLLISTER Wa

canine teeth are exceptionally long. The clouded leopard has quite
an extensive distribution and is found from the mountains of
northern India to the islands of Java, Sumatra, and Borneo.

The cheetah, known also as the “ hunting leopard,” is sometimes
trained to hunt the antelope and other game. Long limbed and
slender, with high rounded head, and with claws less retractile than
in the other cats, he has many points of resemblance with the dog;
this resemblance is not confined to external appearance, but is found
also in the muscles. <A pair of African cheetahs (Acinonyx jubatus)
was brought over in 1913 by the head keeper of the park from the
Government Zoological Garden, Giza, Egypt. They have developed
splendidly here and may be considered one of the most important
exhibits.

CIVETS AND HYENAS

The civet cats and their allies, the mongooses, genets, and palm
civets comprise the family Viverride. They are of diverse types
and are native to the Old World, but one species of mongoose has
been introduced in some of the West Indian Islands where it has
nearly exterminated many of the native species of birds. Regula-
tions against the introduction of this pest into the United States are
rigidly enforced, but a specimen was, nevertheless, killed in Ken-
tucky in 1920. How the animal came to be there is not known. It
is greatly to be hoped that the mongoose will never get a foothold
in any part of the United States, as the practical extermination of
many of our finest ground-nesting game birds would surely follow
its introduction.

The spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta) is the commonest African
species of the family Hywnide. He is a large, powerful brute with
jaws and teeth specially developed for crushing bones. The speci-
men kept in the lion house is a great pet and is excited to supreme
content by a little attention. Unlike the great cats, he pays not
the slightest attention to bones in the meat fed to him, but crushes
even the largest as easily and rapidly as if he were eating much
softer food. A smaller species, the striped hyena, inhabits India
and northern Africa, and a much rarer kind, the browm hyena, or
“strand wolf” (Hyawna brunnea), is confined to parts of Africa.
Hyenas are essentially carrion eaters and are largely nocturnal in
habits.

The aard-wolf (Proteles cristatus) is related to the hyenas, but is
a much smaller animal with much less powerful teeth. The teeth,
in fact, are so reduced and simplified as to be of very little use,
and the animal feeds very largely upon termites and other insects.
The aard-wolf inhabits Africa from Nubia to the Cape. It is very
rarely seen in collections of living animals. The specimen in the
National Zoological Park is on exhibition in the antelope house.
312 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923
THE DOG FAMILY

This interesting group of mammals includes the dog, wolf, fox,
jackal, and their numerous relatives. It is one of the best-known
families in a popular way, but the exact limits of the genera and
species are matters not yet thoroughly worked out by any zoologist.

The true wolves were formerly abundant animals over much of
the Northern Hemisphere, and, although exterminated by man in
many regions, still persist in numbers in some well-inhabited areas.
Although long since gone from the British Islands, they are found
to this day in numerous parts of continental Europe and are abund-
ant in the less settled portions of central Asia. In North America
wolves formerly roamed in large packs over the great game fields
and were especially numerous throughout the bison country. The
northern “ timber wolf” and the “ buffalo wolf” of the great plains
are powerful beasts and are able to take down our largest animals.
The wolves of the Southern States are of less bulk and some species
are barely larger than the coyote.

The wolf of the northern Rocky Mountain States (Canis nubilus)
varies greatly in color, as usual with the American species. Among
the specimens in the park are some of the typical “ gray wolves”
and some very dark, almost blackish examples. Many young wolves
of this species have been reared in the park. A specimen of the
timber wolf (C. occidentalis) from the upper peninsula of Michigan
is also shown. This is the wolf of the great forests of northern
United States and Canada.

The coyote of the northern plains (Canis latrans) is a large
species approximating some of the smaller wolves in size. It ranges
east to Wisconsin and western Indiana, where it is frequently con-
founded with the timber wolf; old hunters and trappers often fail
to distinguish between the animals. In some localities it is called
the brush wolf by those who recognize the difference between it and
its larger and more powerful relative. Numerous other species and
subspecies of the coyote are found in the Western States and in
Mexico. The coyote is structurally closer to the Old World jackal
than to the big wolves, and takes the place of the jackal in the
American fauna.

The red fox (Vulpes fulva) is very common in parts of the North,
but is rare in many of the Southern States. In the boreal regions of
Canada and the northern United States it takes on a splendid coat
and the fur is of considerable value. The cross fox and the black
or silver fox are color phases of this species and examples of each are
sometimes found in litters of red foxes. Both phases occur most fre-
quently in definite geographic areas, however, and in some western
localities the cross fox coloration is the common condition. Silver
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 813

foxes are now bred in confinement and the skins frequently bring
enormous prices in the fur market.

The swift, or kit fox (Vulpes velov) is an inhabitant of the open
areas of the West and is found in many of the most arid deserts. A
number of species and races are recognized by mammalogists. The
fur has no real value.

The common gray fox abounds in many parts of the United States
and Middle America. Unlike the red fox, it is a good climber and if
pursued by dogs readily takes to trees. The common eastern species
(Urocyon cinereoargenteus) maintains itself in well-settled com-
munities and is sometimes known by the misnomer of “ silver-gray
fox.” In localities where it is not often taken, the capture of a speci-
inen frequently excites the trapper to the belief that he has a speci-
men of the real prized and valuable silver fox. The genuine silver
fox, mentioned above as a color phase of the red fox, is chiefly black,
with more or less white hair mixed in the pelage; whereas the gray
fox is always gray and rufous, with a blackish stripe along the upper
surface of the tail. The fur of the gray fox is comparatively short
and coarse, but is of real beauty and is considerably used by the
trade. Its value is much less than the fur of the red fox.

A most interesting member of this group is the great-eared fox
(Otocyon megalotis) of South Africa. What is probably the first
specimen of this species ever exhibited alive in America was pre-
sented to the park by Mr. Victor J. Evans, of Washington. The as-
tonishing development of the ears is the chief characteristic of this
rare fox.

The Eskimo dog is a variety of the common domestic animal
(Canis familiaris) and, contrary to general belief, apparently is
not a direct and scarcely modified descendant of the wolf now
found wild in the northern regions. Examination of dozens of
skulls of dogs from the ancient Eskimo dwelling sites of north-
eastern Siberia and from more recent Eskimo tribes fails to disclose
any more wolflike characteristics in the bones or teeth than are
found in all large domestic dogs. The primitive Eskimo dog skulls
are almost counterparts in all characters of the dog skulls found
in ancient Egyptian burials and in the pre-Columbian graves of
Peru. Domestic dogs have the general wolf type of skull and teeth
without admixture of characters derived from jackal, coyote, or any
South American member of the dog family; but the animal is of
very ancient origin and its actual wolflike ancestor is not for a
certainty known.

Another very interesting dog is the dingo (Canis dingo) of Aus-
tralia. It is found in a wild state, and also, it is said, in a semi-
domesticated state among the natives of that country. It has been
generally believed that the dingo was introduced by man into Aus-
314 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

tralia at some early time, but there is some evidence, furnished by
fossil remains, that it existed there with some of the extinct mar-
supials at a period earlier than man is surely known in that region.
In color the dingo is usually reddish or rufous-tawny, although
individuals lighter or darker in color than the average specimens
are known to occur in an apparently wild state. Whatever the true
origin of the dingo, it is certainly as truly a wild animal in Australia
in modern times as any of the native marsupials or the ratlike
rodents.
RACCOONS AND THEIR ALLIES

The common raccoon (Procyon lotorv) has a special yard near the
elephant houses, with a fine tree in which the animals of the colony
may be seen sunning themselves in the topmost branches. South
American representatives of the coon family, the kinkajou (Potos
flavus) and the coati-mundi (Vasua narica) are also kept in the park.
Both of these animals occur northward throughout much of Central
America and Mexico, and the coati-mundi has been captured in south-
ern Arizona.

The panda (Adlurus fulgens), of the high Himalaya Mountains,
is interesting, not only because of its peculiar red, white, and black
coloration, but also because it is the only Old World representative
of the raccoon family. It is very fond of bamboo, which is provided
as a regular part of its diet.

The cacomistle (Bassariscus astutus) is a beautiful little animal
often called the “ ring-tailed cat,” “coon cat,” or “civet.” It is com-
mon along the Pacific coast of the United States and southward into
the Tropics. It has many structural characters of the dogs and, al-
though usually classified with the raccoons, has been made the type
of a distinct family. The fur at times becomes fashionable and many
skins are placed on the market.

HE WEASEL FAMILY

This group of highly bloodthirsty mammals includes such diverse
types as the weasel, badger, skunk, marten, and otter. The family
has an extensive distribution and species are found in most parts of
the globe with the exception of Australia and Madagascar.

The American badgers (Za«idea taxus) have a fine yard in the
park where they can usually be seen in their characteristic occupa-
tion of digging in the soil. So active are they in this work that
the dirt within the inclosure is constantly turned over and always
presents the appearance of a newly spaded garden. The European
badgers (Meles meles), on the contrary, are rarely seen, as they
spend almost the entire day asleep under the straw in a corner of
their quarters.
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 315

The common skunk of the Eastern States (Afemphitis nigra), the
marten (Martes americana), the fisher (Martes pennanti), and the
mink (Mustela vison) are all American species which are essentially
nocturnal and attract little attention in their cages from visitors to
the park. The neotropical tayra (Z'ayra barbara), on the con-
trary, is a friendly, active animal always ready to show himself to
visitors.

The otter pens, along the stream above the beaver and sea lion
pools, offer an attractive show of the home life of animals. Here
a pair of American otters (Lutra canadensis) have reared their
young and the mother with her family can be seen. Otters are
very intelligent and playful animals and may easily be made at-
tractive pets. Moreover, since it is practicable to rear them in
captivity, the breeding of otters may be made a very pleasant and
profitable occupation, as the skins command a fine price in the fur
market.

THE BEAR DENS

The park maintains a splendid collection of bears and few animals
attract so much attention from the public as do these interesting
creatures. The dens are conveniently and pleasantly located on the
west side of the main highway through the park where the animals
have ideal conditions for comfort and health.

The polar bears (7'halarctos maritimus) are confined to the Arctic
regions. On the Atlantic coast of America they formerly occurred
regularly south to Labrador. White at all seasons, active in the cages
and pool, and expert swimmers, the polar bears are great favorites in
the park. Contrary to general belief, the polar bears do not. parti-
cularly suffer from the summer heat of Washington. It is to be
remembered that there are many warm days in summer in their
native home and that during this season the bears commonly go
ashore and subsist for periods almost wholly upon a vegetable diet.
During most of the remainder of the year the food of the polar bear
consists mainly of the flesh of seals. A polar bear in the park at
one time weighed 760 pounds.

The European brown bear (Ursus arctos) is the bear usually
seen accompanying itinerant street exhibitions. It naturally stands
erect on its hind feet much more than do the other bears and is,
consequently, much more readily trained for such purposes. Many
young of this species have been reared in the park.

The great and confusing variety of bears found in northwestern
America has puzzled naturalists since the first discovery of those
huge beasts. Some of the brown bears of Alaska, notably those of
the Alaskan Peninsula and Kadiak Island, are the largest of all
living species and appear to be intimately related to the brown bears
316 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

of eastern Asia and to the extinct. cave bears of Europe. Several
species of the great Alaskan brown bears are shown in the park. One
kept for several years weighed at one time 1,160 pounds.

There are splendid examples of the Kadiak bear (Ursus midden-
dorffii) ; the Peninsula bear (U. gyas); the Yakutat bear (U. dalli),
and Kidder’s bear (U. kidderi) of Cook Inlet.

The grizzly bear (Ursus horribilis) is perhaps the most cele-
brated of all the bears and has the greatest reputation for strength
and ferocity. In the early days of the West the grizzly was very
plentiful, and no story of adventure in that region was complete
unless it introduced the “ silver tip” at some point in the tale. Nowa-
days grizzly bears are rare or completely exterminated over most of
their former range in the United States, but are still found in the
Yellowstone National Park, from which place most of our specimens
come. In the Rocky Mountains of Canada, and particularly in
British Columbia, grizzly bears are commonly found. Numerous
species and subspecies of grizzlies are now recognized.

The common black bear of North America (Ursus americanus)
has a very extensive distribution from Alaska to Florida; a-number
of geographical races are recognized within this area. This animal
has persistently held its own in some of the more settled States, and,
like the white-tailed deer, with proper protection is in little danger
of extermination. The cinnamon bear, a color phase of the black
bear, is of most frequent occurrence in certain parts of the West where
a geographical race of the common bear is recognized as Ursus
americanus cinnamomum.

One of the rarest of all the bears is the glacier bear, or blue bear
(Ursus emmonsiz) of the Mount St. Elias Alps, Alaska. It has a
beautiful coat of a blue-gray color. The first living specimen of
this interesting American mammal ever exhibited in any zoological
garden was received at the National Zoological Park in 1917 as a
gift from Mr. Victor J. Evans, of Washington, District of Columbia,
who secured it from a resident of Yakutat, Alaska. It was captured
as a small cub by Indians about the middle of May, 1916, at the
head of Disenchantment Bay. The only specimens ever received be-
fore this time were a few skins, mostly obtained by fur traders, and
several skulls which have found their way into museums.

The Himalayan bear (Ursus thibetanus), the sloth bear (A/elursus
ursinus), and the sun bear (Helarctos malayanus) are among the
foreign bears exhibited.

SEALS AND SEA LIONS

The common harbor seal of the Atlantic coast (Phoca vitulina)
is the typical species of a large group of “ hair seals ” inhabiting the
ocean of the Northern Hemisphere. It has a wide distribution and is
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK——-HOLLISTER aly

found on both shores of the Atlantic, ranging well down the coast of
the United States. Near relatives are found in the northern Pacific
Ocean, in the Caspian Sea, and in Lake Baikal, Siberia. The har-
bor seal is an interesting creature, spotted in coat, with a little
round head, and an inquisitive face.

The sea lion pool, just west of the bear dens, is a popular show
place with the public. In it are kept the California sea lions
(Zalophus californianus). This species, so familiar to visitors to the
Pacific coast, is the animal usually seen in shows of trained sea
lions. It is a noisy animal, and the bark of the male can be heard
for a considerable distance.

Feeding time at the sea lion pool is an exciting occasion. The
animals are fed fish, some of considerable size, which are handed
or thrown to them by the keeper from the high rocky den at the end
of the pool. It is at this time that visitors can best see for themselves
what expert and exceedingly rapid swimmers these animals are. A
fish thrown anywhere within reasonable distance of one of the sea
lions rarely strikes the water, so expert are the animals in catching
them.

THE MARSUPIALS, OR POUCHED MAMMALS

These interesting creatures, although in former periods of time
having a wide distribution over the earth, are now confined to
Australia and America. They are separated from all the other
living mammals by many structural characters. The most interest-
ing point from a popular view is the fact that the young are born
at a much earlier stage of development than in other mammals, and
spend a long period of growth in the marsupium, or abdominal
pouch of the mother, where they are firmly attached to the teats.
The newly born young of the larger kangaroos are no larger than a
baby mouse, but by the time they first look out of the opening
of the pouch, some weeks later, they are grown to a point compar-
able to the ordinary mammals at birth.

The marsupials in America are all opossums or ratlike forms,
but in Australia and Tasmania there are marsupials to represent
many of the variations found in the mammals of the world—wolf,
bear, squirrel, flying squirrel, cat, marmot, rat, rabbit, lemur, ant-
eater, and mole are all imitated in superficial points of structure
and mode of life.

Marsupials most often seen in collections of living animals are
the various species of kangaroos, wallaby, and wallaroo; the phal-
angers, Tasmanian devil, wombat, and opossums.

The larger species, the great gray kangaroo (Macropus gigan-
teus), the red kangaroo (M. rufus), and the wallaroo (d/. robustus)
naturally attract the most attention. They are showy, breed well in

1454—25——22
318 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

captivity, and the young animals, in and out of the pouch, are a
never-ceasing wonder to visitors. From the time when the young
are first noted moving in the pouch, it is about three months, with
these large kangaroos, before the little animal first puts his head
out of the opening. Then follows a very interesting and amusing
few weeks during which the young is in or out of the marsupium at
his pleasure; sometimes with foot or head out in the most grotesque
positions. Finally the mother, when the young animal has grown
to a considerable size, refuses it further admission to the pouch.
These kangaroos sometimes attain a size of over 5 feet for the head.
and body alone; the added length of the great tail makes the animal
appear much larger.

Several smaller species of kangaroos are usually kept in the an-
telope house. Among the most interesting at the present time are
the rufous-bellied wallaby (J. billardierii) and the brush-tailed
rock kangaroo (Petrogale penicillata). The rock kangaroos are at
home in rough country rather than in level areas; the tail is less
robust than in the other species and is not used as a ground rest
when the animal stands erect.

The phalanger (7'7ichosurus vulpecula) is another Australian
species, largely nocturnal, and with the habit of playing “ ’pos-
sum ” like its American relative. It is not active in the cages and
is rather uninteresting in the zoo. The wombat (Phascolomys
mitchellt) is a powerful, heavy-set brute, with large head and only
au short stump of a tail. It is a burrowing animal and is said to
live in small colonies. This is an Australian species, but a closely
related form inhabits Tasmania.

The Tasmanian devil (Sarcophilus harrisii) is as ugly disposi-
tioned a beast as he is displeasing to the eye. Naturally of nocturnal
habits he is not often active in the cage. The Virginia opossum
(Didelphis virginiana) is likewise of such retiring disposition that
he is seldom seen. A small relative, called the murine opossum
(Marmosa murina), is a native of tropical America and occasionally
finds its way into the United States as a stowaway in a bunch of
bananas. .

BIRDS

Birds (class Aves) are often defined as “ animals with feathers,”
and this diagnosis answers every purpose for popular use, since all
birds have feathers and no other animals possess them. No class
of animals has received so much popular attention and few so much
scientific study as have the birds. Almost any single locality offers a
large list of species, and the variety to be found during the spring
and fall migration makes a study of the birds of any vicinity an
interesting and exciting occupation. On account of their great
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 319

beauty, interesting characteristics, peculiar coloration, or grotesque
appearance, most birds are popular as cage pets and the collections
in the Zoological Park are great attractions to the public. The
great flight cage near the west entrance, the bird house, the water-
fowl lakes, the eagle cage, and numerous smaller inclosures are used
to exhibit the birds to best advantage. Each variety is given so
far as possible the best conditions afforded by the natural features
of the park or the resources available for improvements. No com-
plete systematic arrangement of the birds is, therefore, practicable,
but so far as is convenient related birds are grouped together.
Twelve or more distinct orders of birds, according to recent schemes
of classification, are commonly represented in the park by numerous
species, and some of the most conspicuous or interesting varieties
of each group will be mentioned here in proper sequence.

OSTRICH-LIKE BIRDS

The existing members of this group (Ratite) are, with the excep-
tion of the kiwis of New Zealand, all large birds. They are in-
capable of flight, but are swift of foot and exceedingly wary, and
are, moreover, able to defend themselves vigorously with beak and
foot. They are keen of sight and, except the cassowary, are in-
habitants of open country.

The ostriches are of maximum size for existing birds, a full-
grown male sometimes measuring more than 8 feet in height. They
are distinguished from all other birds by having only two toes -
on each foot. The true ostriches are now confined to Africa and
the adjacent portions of southwestern Asia, where several species
occur. Three of these forms are shown in the park. A specimen
of the great Somaliland ostrich (Struthio molybdophanes) was pre-
sented to President Roosevelt by Emperor Menelik of Abyssinia,
and is a magnificient example of this fine bird. A somewhat similar
species is the Nubian ostrich (S. camelus). The South African
ostrich (S. australis) is the species most commonly kept on the
ostrich farms in the Southwest, where the bird is reared for its
feathers. The adult male ostrich is a splendid bird in his black and
white plumage, but the females and young males are of a dull
grayish-brown coloration.

The ostrich is represented in South America by the rhea, one
species of which (hea americana) is kept in the park. This is a
bird of considerably less size than the ostrich; it has three toes,
and its feathers are of less commercial importance. Like its African
relative, it is an inhabitant of the open country and is found on the
pampas of Argentina and on the great plains of southern Brazil
and Bolivia.
320 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Australia and the neighboring islands are the homes of a number
of ostrichlike birds. The park possesses examples of two of these
peculiar types: The common cassowary (Casuarius galeatus) is a
native of Ceram, but closely related forms occur in New Guinea,
Australia, and on other islands. The emu (Dromiceius novehol-
landtee) comes from Australia. The birds kept in the park have laid
many of the beautiful and characteristic dark green eggs, about 10
of which constitute the usual clutch. :

The kiwi, or apteryx, is the smallest of the ratite birds. Several
species are known, all of which inhabit New Zealand, where they
are now becoming rare. The species on exhibition in the bird house
is Apterye mantelli, confined to North Island. The plumage is
hair-lhke. Kiwis are shy, retiring birds; they feed principally upon
worms, for which they probe the earth with the long bill.

THE STORKS AND THEIR RELATIVES

~ This group (Ciconiiformes) of water birds includes, among other
families, the pelicans, cormorants, snakebirds, herons, storks, ibises,
and flamingoes. Most of the species are essentially aquatic and some
are among the most expert of swimmers. Other kinds are primarily
waders, with long legs and with the feet imperfectly webbed. There
is likewise great variation in the power of flight and among the
diverse species are found some of the swiftest and most graceful as
well as the most sluggish of water birds awing.

PELICANS AND CORMORANTS

The members of the section of ciconiid birds which includes the
pelicans, cormorants, and darters are distinguished from the storks
and herons by their very short legs and the completely webbed feet;
even the hind toe, which is in reality turned sharply inward, is con-
nected by a web.

The American white pelicans (Pelecanus erythrorhynchos) are
graceful birds on the wing or in the water and very clumsy ashore.
In the breeding season a curious horny knob appears on the bill of
the adult bird. These pelicans are common in the interior of
western North America; the specimens inhabiting the “ pelican
pond” came from Wyoming. The brown pelican of the Southern
States (P. occidentalis) and several exotic species are exhibited*in
summer in the big flight cage.

Pelicans are fascinating birds to watch and frequently reward the
observer with some queer antics. On one occasion the flock of Amer-
ican white pelicans in the park was seen to form a circle in the water,
all the birds intent, toward the center, with bills frequently sub-
merged. Suddenly the cause of the commotion was apparent, for
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 321

one of them seized a water snake about 214 feet long and tossed it
some distance in the air. ‘This act was quickly repeated a number
of times by different birds until one of the pelicans swallowed the
unfortunate snake. He attempted to keep his prey down by holding
his bill close to the body, but his efforts were unavailing, for the
snake wrggled up into the gular pouch and eventually forced his
way out of the pelican’s mouth and escaped. One of the pelicans
once swallowed a black-bellied tree duck and retained the bird in
‘his stomach for 60 hours, but finally disgorged it, only partially
digested. Various unusual objects have been swallowed at different
times by the pelicans; a sharp bamboo cutting about 6 inches long
worked its way out of one bird’s stomach and was removed after it
had pierced the lower body. This pelican did not seem to suffer in
the least from his experience and did not miss a meal. An American
white pelican received at the park October 7, 1897, is still living in
good health.

Numbers of cormorants (Phalacrocorax auritus floridanus) reg-
ularly breed in the flight cage, constructing their nests of sticks in
the branches of the larger trees within the inclosure. That these
birds are well satisfied with their home is proved by the fact that
one which escaped and remained away for more than a day returned
to the cage; the keeper found him near the door waiting to be let in.

HERONS AND STORKS

Several species of stork-like birds are regularly kept in the big
light cage; some hardy kinds like the black-crowned night herons
(Nycticorax nycticorax nevius) and the great blue herons (Ardea
herodias) remain out throughout the year. The night herons breed
within the inclosure, and wild birds of the same species build their
nests on top of the great cage and in the neighboring tree tops. More
delicate species, including the snowy egret (Y'gretta candidissima) ,
nearly exterminated in the Southern States for the millinery trade,
the curious boatbill (Cochleartus cochlearius), and the beautiful
scarlet ibis (Guara rubra), all from South America, have permanent
quarters in the bird house. The roseate spoonbills (Ajaia ajaja) and
- several species of ibis summer in the open flight cage, but are kept in
the bird house in winter.

The storks, typical members of this group of birds, are represented
by several species, including an American form, the wood ibis
(Mycteria americana) which is regularly found in the Southern
States and in tropical America. The marabou stork, or adjutant
(Leptoptilos dubius) is a striking bird with a naked head and neck,
a powerful beak, and a white ruff above his shoulders; he is native
to the Indian region. The common stork of Europe (Ciconia
ciconia) and the black stork (C. nigra) are both shown. The latter
322 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

is an especially attractive species; shiny black in color, with a white
breast and belly, and bright red bill and feet. The white storks
have several times nested in the great flight cage.

THE FLAMINGOES

These pinkish birds with long legs and neck and angular beak are
in many ways connecting links between the storklike birds and the
ducks and geese. Several species are found in parts of tropical
America and one formerly occurred in Florida, but the species living
in the pelican pond is one of the Old World forms, the European
flamingo (Phenicopterus roseus). The birds thrive in this place,
but during the colder months when confined in the bird house they
are difficult to keep in good condition.

DUCKS, GEESE, AND SWANS

The most picturesque and ornamental of all the birds for outdoor
exhibition in zoological gardens are the true water-fowl, the game
birds known as ducks, geese, and swans. Numerous showy species
have been domesticated or brought to a condition of semidomestica-
tion and other more unusual species are successfully kept in captivity
under proper conditions. The group is cosmopolitan in distribution,
and no less than 67 species and subspecies are known from North
America north of the Mexican border. The order (Anseriformes)
includes besides the typical family of waterfowl a small group
of South American birds known as the screamers.

THE NORTH AMERICAN WATERFOWL LAKE

In the southeastern side of the park advantage has been taken
of the natural topography to repreduce in a measure one of the
waterfowl breeding lakes formerly so numerous in the Northern
States. For educational purposes, the birds kept in this lake have
been restricted to those species known to occur in North America,
as enumerated in the check list of North American birds. Border-
ing the lake on three sides is a tract of land sufficient in size to
furnish retired nesting places for the birds and suitable for their
varied requirements—woods, thickets, open brushy areas, cane, and
marshes. The whole tract is inclosed by a vermin-proof fence so
that the birds may nest and rear their young in safety. It is the
intention to show in this lake as many of the 67 species of North
American ducks, geese, and swans as possible, and a good beginning
has been made in collecting the birds. At the present time no less
than 250 waterfowl are on exhibition in the North American lake,
including 33 different species.
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—-HOLLISTER 8238

EXOTIC WATERFOWL

Numerous interesting and beautiful exotic waterfowl are on exhi-
bition in the pelican pond, in the flight cage, and in special inclosures
in suitable places throughout the park. Specimens of the graceful —
mute swan (Cygnus gibbus) enjoy the freedom of Rock Creek and
nest along its banks. The strange black swan of Australia (Che-
nopis atrata), the pied goose (Anseranas semipalmata) from the
same region, the bar-head goose (Anser indicus) from India, the
rosy-billed pochard (MMetopiana peposaca) and the upland goose
(Chloéphaga leucoptera) of South America are examples of the
variety shown. A large flock of the most strikingly ornamental
and curiously colored mandarin duck (Dendronessa galericulata)
is maintained. This species is native to eastern Asia, particularly
China and Japan.

Of particular interest among the waterfowl is the Hawaiian goose
(Nesochen sandvicensis). The park is very fortunate in possessing
specimens of this fine goose, which is now all but exterminated. The
Hawaiian goose is confined to the island of Hawaii, where it for-
merly inhabited the crater meadows and, during the breeding season,
the lava beds near sea level.

BIRDS OF PREY

The hawks, eagles, and vultures, commonly known as birds of
prey, form a natural and well-defined order, the Falconiformes. The
group contains the largest of flying birds and most of the species
are of good size, but some of the falcons are barely larger than spar-
rows. The owls were formerly placed in this order, but are now
known to be nearer in structural characters to the goatsucker family,
a widely different group represented in the United States by the
whippoorwill and related birds.

THE EAGLES’ CAGE

The large open flight cage near the bird house is devoted to such
larger members of this group as will endure our winter climate and
live peacefully together. Here may be seen magnificent specimens
of our national bird, the bald eagle (Haliwetus leucocephalus) , show-
ing the transition plumages from the younger blackish specimens to
the fully plumaged adult with white head and tail. The largest
specimens of this bird come from Alaska and the Northwest, while
the eagles from Florida and other Southern States are very inferior
in size. Another eagle found in the United States, but with an ex-
tensive Old World distribution as well, is the golden eagle (Aquila
chrysaétos). It is a fine species, distinguished from the bald eagle
in any plumage by the feathered legs.
824 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

A number of exotic eagles and vultures, some of which are of
great size, share this cage with the American eagles. The lammer-
geier (Gypaétus barbatus), or bearded vulture, is a large species
connecting in many features the eagles with the vultures. It is a
native of the higher mountains of Europe, north Africa, and Asia,
and many tales of its boldness and strength have been told. The
griffon vulture (Gyps fulvus) and the cinereous vulture (Aegypius
monachus) are two conspicuous Old World species kept in this cage.
During the early spring months the griffon vultures become very
savage and sometimes attack their cage mates—even the eagles are
made to suffer on these occasions unless the griffons are removed
from the cage. Two specimens of the handsome wedge-tailed eagle
(Uroaétus audax) of Australia are kept in this cage. Because it
eats the poisoned meat-baits thrown out by the ranchers to destroy
the wild dogs, this characteristic Australian bird is said to be rapidly
diminishing in numbers, and is in danger of extermination.

INTERESTING RAPTORES IN THE BIRD HOUSE

Several interesting specimens of eagles and vultures are to be seen
in the bird house. The secretary bird (Sagittarius serpentarius) is
a peculiar African type with long legs, tail, and wings, and a crest
of elongated feathers at the back of the head. In appearance it is
very cranelike, and is expert in the killing of snakes, lizards, and small
mammals.

The harpy eagle (7hrasaétos harpyia) is a tropical American
species famous for its strength and spectacular appearance. It is a
large species with a long, barred tail, a fine crest, an enormous beak,
and powerful feet. It is said to kill fawns, monkeys, and peccaries.
The park is proud of its record in having kept a fine specimen of this
bird for 18 years.

The caracara (Polyborus cheriway) or “carrion hawk” is com-
mon in parts of tropical America and ranges northward to Florida.
Other related species are known from South America.

Various North American and exotic hawks are also on exhibition.
‘The red-tailed hawk (Buteo borealis) is one of the common species
of the United States which, with other kinds, is much persecuted as
a “chicken hawk.” Asa matter of fact this bird rarely kills chickens
and is an industrious destroyer of noxious rodents. One of the
smaller species shown is the sparrow hawk (Falco sparverius), a
pretty and valuable species which eats many grasshoppers, mice, and
other pests of the farmer. Cooper’s hawk (Accipiter coopert), an-
other of the smaller species of America, is more destructive to poultry
and birds.

AMERICAN VULTURES

A group of raptorial birds peculiar to America includes our com-
mon turkey vulture or “ buzzard,” the carrion crow, and the condors.
There is little necessity for showing specimens of the turkey vulture
(Cathartes aura) in cages, since many wild birds of this species
make the park their permanent home. The retired wooded slopes
bordering the Zoo offer ideal congregating and roosting places for
all the “buzzards” of the surrounding country. The birds are en-
couraged to remain here as an added attraction to the park, and many
visitors from Northern States to whom the “buzzard” is an un-
familiar sight are delighted to see them at such close quarters and to
watch their graceful flight.

The California condor (Gymnogyps californianus) formerly
ranged northward along the Pacific coast to the Columbia River
and was an abundant bird in southern California. It is now rarely
seen, great numbers having been poisoned by the ranchers in efforts’
to exterminate the carnivorous animals. A few linger in parts of
southern California and in the San Pedro Martir Mountains of
Lower California, Mexico. It is deplorable that so fine a member
of our avifauna should disappear, but the same fate is in store for
other less notable species—even the exceedingly beneficial turkey
vulture, after long years of protection, is now under the ban of
mistaken legislation and is becoming greatly reduced in numbers in
many of our Southern States. Three splendid spetimens of the
California condor are shown in an outside cage west of lion-house
hill.

Another striking bird of this group is the king vulture (Sarco-
ramphus papa), also of South America. It is a beautifully colored
species which has a habit of strutting or dancing with the body held
rigidly erect, the wings partially spread, and the head thrown for-
ward against the breast.

GALLINACEOUS BIRDS

This order includes all of the true “fowls,” domestic poultry,
and the various species of pheasants, quail, and grouse. It is a group
of birds of special interest to the sportsman, since almost all of the
so-called upland game birds are members of the order. Many species
of gallinaceous birds are of great beauty and are kept purely for
show purposes, while others are easily reared in sufficient numbers to
stock depleted covers and provide recreation for lovers of outdoor
sports. Game keepers have paid much attention in late years to
breeding the more hardy and easily kept species and are now turn-
326 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

ing their attention to experimental work in the hatching and rearing
of the more difficult native varieties.

Peafowl (Pavo cristatus) and bobwhite quail (Colinus virgini-
anus) roam at large and nest within the borders of the park, but
until a suitable pheasantry can be established the exhibition of
gallinaceous birds must necessarily be restricted to such species as
are easily kept under ordinary conditions. A few showy pheasants
and several American forms of quail or partridge are kept in the
bird house.

The curassows are fine, large gallinaceous birds found from
Mexico to South America. There are a number of species, two of
which are shown—the razor-billed (Mitu mitu) and Daubenton’s
curassow (Crax daubentont). Unlike most of the forms of this
group of birds, the curassows are largely arboreal in habit and nest
in trees. The feathers of the back and rump are always soft and
downy, unlike those of the other gallinaceous game birds.

Closely related are the penelopes and guans, of which the chacha-
laca (Ortalis vetula), ranging north into Texas, is an example.
Several South American forms are on exhibition, the finest of which
is the Bolivian penelope (Penelope boliwiana). These large galli-
naceous birds are very attractive pets and become most tame and
confiding.

CRANES AND THEIR ALLIES

This group x Gruiformes) includes the cranes, rails, cariamas, and
bustards, as well as some lesser known forms. It has a wide distri-
bution, and as its members are frequently classed as “ game birds,”
it has a great popular interest. The cranes comprise some of the
most showy of zoological park avian exhibits and are now much
sought by private collectors of living birds. The remaining families
within the order are less often seen in zoological gardens, but are,
nevertheless, all birds of more than ordinary interest to the orni-
thologist.

One of the finest species, the great whooping crane (@rus ameri-
cana) is bordering upon extinction. It bred formerly from north-
ern Mackenzie south to Illinois and Iowa and occurred commonly in
migrations through the Central and Southern States. It is a splen-
did bird; white, with black primaries and primary coverts. Natur-
ally a wild and wary creature, it rapidly became scarce after its
breeding grounds were settled by man, and it is now virtually im-
possible to obtain specimens.

The sand-hill crane (Grus mexicana) is another American species,
still common in parts of Florida and in the Western States. Like
the white crane, it is a shy bird and difficult to secure, and the rapid
settlement of its range has naturally greatly reduced its numbers.
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 827

In parts of the upper Mississippi Valley, where it formerly bred but
now occurs only in migration, it is a bird of the prairies and corn-
fields, where its habits are much the same as those of the Canada
goose. Small flocks flying low over the prairies, to and from the
feeding grounds, are easily mistaken for geese, but when the birds are
migrating, in great circles high in the air, there is no cause for mis-
identification. At reasonable range, flying cranes are readily dis-
tinguished from geese by the long legs, extending backward; and may
be instantly known from the blue heron (often erroneously called
blue crane) by the long neck, which is held extended forward and
never folded back as with the herons.

The little brown crane (Grus canadensis), much like the sand-hill
crane but smaller, is still common in the West. It breeds in Alaska
and northern Canada and winters in Texas, California, and Mexico.

A number of exotic cranes, some of striking appearance, are reg-
ularly kept in the park. Of the genus Grus a number of Asiatic
species are shown, including the large sarus crane (Grus Gollaris),
the white-necked crane (@’. leucauchen) so often pictured in Japanese
drawings; the Indian white crane (G. lewcogeranus) ; and Lilford’s
crane (G. lilfordi), which represents the common European crane
in eastern Siberia. A fine Australian species (G. rubicunda) is often
called the “ native companion.”

The demoiselle crane (Anthropoides virgo) of southern Europe
and Asia and northern Africa is a pretty little species with white
ear tufts; and the crowned crane of Africa (Balearica pavonina)
is a still more handsome form supporting an erect occipital tuft
which is decidedly showy.

Specimens of the American coot (Fulica americana), representing
the rail family, may be seen in the North American waterfowl lake.
This bird, often called the “ mud hen,” or “ crow duck,” has a wide
distribution in North America. It breeds from central Canadian
Provinces south to Texas, Tennessee, and New Jersey; and winters
from the Central States to northern South America. In many places
the coot is classed as a game bird, and properly cooked it provides
a very palatable food. Several exotic relatives are always on -
exhibition.

An interesting flightless rail from New Zealand, known as the
weka, differs greatly from our common members of the family in
habits, as it is a bird of the forest and scrub rather than of wet
marshes or lakes. Although the wekas have imperfectly developed
wings, and are incapable of flight, they are expert climbers, and the
inclosure in which they are kept must be covered completely. They
are of the size of a well-grown pullet and are quarrelsome and mis-
chievous, even among others of their own kind. Three species
328 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

(Ocydromus australis, O. brachypterus, and O. earli), all from South
Island, are on exhibition. They were received as a gift from the
New Zealand Government.

The white-backed trumpeter (Psophia leucoptera) represents a
group of South American birds related to the cranes and rails.
The trumpeters are forest birds and are sometimes found in con-
siderable flocks. They are easily tamed and are often kept by the
natives to protect domestic poultry, much as our farmers keep the
guinea fowl for the same purpose. The loud call must be particu-
larly impressive when heard in a dark jungle.

Another member of the crane assemblage is the kagu (Rhynoche-
tos jubatus), a rare bird found only on the island of New Caledonia,
east of Australia. It represents an ancient type, with no existing
near relatives. The kagu is about the size and general form of a
night heron. Several specimens of this unusual bird are on exhi-
bition.

- SHORE BIRDS, GULLS, AND PIGEONS

In most modern systems for the classification of birds, the snipes
and plovers, gulls and terns, auks, and pigeons are grouped together
in a single order (Charadriiformes), which takes its name from
the typical family, the plovers (Charadriide). A few species of
“ shore birds,” as the plovers and snipes are usually called, and some
gulls, are regularly kept on exhibition; but the chief interest in the
order, so far as zoological gardens are concerned, is concentrated on
the sub-order Columbe, the pigeons and doves.

The shore birds are difficult to keep without the specially pre-
pared quarters which it is hoped the park can sometime arrange;
‘mut from the fact that a specimen of the ruff (Philomachus pugnaz)
was on exhibition in the bird house for over 10 years, the outlook
seems encouraging for success with other species of this interesting
family. Avocets, stilts, plovers, curlews, and many of the larger
snipes should be as easily kept as the ruff. Two species of lapwings
are now shown.

Certain members of the gull family are to be seen in the big flight
cage. These include the large herring gull (Larus argentatus), a
species common to the northern parts of both Europe and America
which has nested here; the more tropical laughing gull (ZL. atricilla),
a smaller, more graceful species sometimes called. the “ black-
headed gull”; the beautiful little silver gull (ZL. novehollandie) of
Australia; and the large Pacific gull (Gabianus pacificus). 'The fin-
est of all the American species, the great black-backed gull (Larus
marinus), is so destructive to smaller birds in the same inclosure
that the specimens in the park must be exhibited only with large
geese, swans, and pelicans, or kept in separate yards.
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 329

PIGEONS

Numerous species of doves and pigeons are kept in the larger cages
of the bird house. These include representatives of the group from
many parts of the world, and form a very attractive exhibit. The
soft colors and beautiful forms of the various species, as well as
their pleasing notes, make them great favorites with all. Among
the larger and more showy forms are the great, plump wonga-
wonga (Leucosarcia picata) of Australia, curiously marked with
white forehead and pectoral bands; the European wood pigeon
(Columbia palumbus) ; the handsome bronze-wing (Phaps chalecop-
tera) ; and the green doves (Chalcophaps) of India and New Guinea.

Opposed to these larger species are some groups of small doves,
found in both the Old World and in the warmer parts of America
which are particularly noticeable on account of their diminutive_
size. These include the Australian and East Indian members of the
genus Geopelia known as the peaceful and zebra doves, and the
little ground doves (Chaemepelia) and Inca doves (Scardafella) of
the southern United States and tropical America.

The Australian crested pigeon (Ocyphaps lophotes) has a long
black crest which it frequently erects, at the same time elevating the
tail until the two almost meet.

The New Guinea fruit pigeon (Péilopus superbus) and the Mar-
quesas Island dove (Gallicolumba rubescens) are among the rarer
species on exhibition. The latter was first made known in 1814,
but was never rediscovered until 1922.

The gigantic crowned pigeons, or gouras, are the most spectacular
of all the group. They are found only in New Guinea and on some
of the neighboring islands, and are from 25 to nearly 34 inches in
length. They are beautifully colored and are further ornamented
by large fan-shaped crests. The species on exhibition, the Victoria
crowned pigeon (Goura victoria), inhabits the islands of Jobi and
Mysori.

CUCKOOS AND PARROTS

The cuckoos and plantain eaters and the great tribe of parrots,
macaws, and cockatoos form the order Cuculiformes. The first
group is poorly represented in the average zoological park col-
lection, but the parrots and their kindred usually form not a small
proportion of any exhibition, and certain species. are almost as
familiar to the average person as is the common canary.

Over 500 species of parrots and their allies are recognized and
these are distributed throughout the tropical countries of both the
Old World and America. Parrots are not confined to the Tropics,
however, since Australia and New Zealand support many species,
330 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

and in North America the Carolina parakeet formerly ranged north-
ward to Wisconsin. Australia, New Guinea, and South America
are especially rich in members of the parrot tribe.

There is always a good representation of these birds in the pe
tional Zoological Park. With the exception of a few hardy species,
all are exhibited in the bird house. In one outdoor cage may be
seen several species of cockatoos, including the bare-eyed (Hakatoe
gymnopis), the beautiful roseate (XH. rosetcapilla), and the sulphur-
crested (X. galerita), and the red-and-yellow-and-blue macaw (Ara
macao). The cockatoos are native to the Australian region and the
Philippine Islands. They are handsome birds, but their shrill
shrieks are unpleasant to hear. Several other species are shown in
the bird house, including the white (ZX. alba), the great red-crested
(KX. moluccensis), and the beautiful rosy-tinted Leadbeater’s cocka-
too (XK. leadbeateri).

The macaws are tropical American birds, mostly of large size and
gaudy plumage. In addition to those in the outside cage, other
species, including the yellow-and-blue (Ara ararauna), the Mexican
green (A. mewxicana), the severe (A. severa), and Cassin’s (A. auri-
collis), may be seen in the bird house. The latter is a very rare
species, our specimen of which was collected in 1922 by the Mulford
Biological Explorations of the Amazon Basin, in Bolivia. A dimin-
utive species is Hahn’s macaw (Diopsittaca hahni).

The thick-billed parrot (Rhynchopsitta pachyrhyncha) is the only
member of the parrot group, excepting the almost extinct Carolina
parakeet, known to occur in the United States. At intervals a num-
ber of years apart, flights of these birds arrive in the mountains of
southern Arizona, coming out of Mexico.

A group of parrots known as the Amazons occur in tropical Amer-
ica. There are about 50 species known, the greater part of which
are green with red markings in some part of the plumage. They
are common cage species and include some of the best of “ talkers.”
Unlike the macaws, all have short tails. The collection now contains
14 species of this group.

An African species which is considered to be fully equal to some
of the Amazons as a talker is the gray parrot (Pstttacus erithacus).
It is an ashy gray in color, with black wing feathers and red tail.
A very attractive group of parrots, many species of which are
popular as cage birds, is the group known as the parakeets. These
are all small birds, some of them actually diminutive. One of the
commonest forms kept as a pet is the shell parakeet, or Australian
grass parakeet (Melopsittacus undulatus). This species breeds in
captivity, nesting in a small box placed within its inclosure. In a
wild state it is said to flock by thousands and spends a considerable
portion of the time on the ground, feeding upon the seeds of grasses.
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER aol

The love bird (Agapornis pullaria) belongs to an African section
of the parakeet tribe and is also popular as a cage pet. The park
is fortunate in the possession of a splendid specimen of the black-
tailed parakeet (Polytelés melanura), a handsome Australian species
now very rare.

Small American species on exhibition include the white-eyed
paroquet (Aratinga leucophthalmus) ; a number of species of the
genera Brotogeris and Tirica, including the favorite Tovi; H'upsi-
tula, including the golden-crowned, Petz’s, and Weddell’s paroquets,
and the peculiar short-tailed parrot (Graydidascalus brachyurus) ,
a species rare in captivity. One of the most attractive exhibits is a
cage containing a number of specimens of the curiously marked and
very entertaining caiques (Pionites xanthomeria) from the Rio Beni,
Bolivia. These are rarely obtained.

The Australian region is inhabited by a group of beautiful parrots
known as lories, several species of which are usually exhibited.

One of the most remarkable of all the parrot tribe is the kea,
or mountain parrot (Nestor notabilis), confined to the South Island
of New Zealand. This bird was formerly abundant in the moun-
tainous parts of this region, but owing to its acquired habit of kill-
ing sheep has been so reduced in numbers that specimens are now
very difficult to obtain. The flock exhibited in an outdoor aviary
near the bird house was received as a gift from the New Zealand
Government. It was more than 10 years after the kea was first
discovered in 1856 before it was suspected that this bird had de-
veloped the habit of killing sheep, and there was considerable doubt
expressed for a number of years. It has been definitely proven
since that although all the individuals of the species have not ac-
quired this remarkable change of habit, many of the birds do really
kill full-grown sheep. The kea lights on the rump of the sheep,
clinging to the wool, and drives his sharp beak into the unfortunate
animal’s back. The fat, flesh, and intestines of the sheep are eaten
by the birds, who frequently go in large flocks.

KINGFISHERS, HORNBILLS, AND OWLS

The kingfishers, hornbills, and owls are members of an order of
birds (Coraciiformes) which includes other seemingly unrelated
families—as the woodpeckers, hummingbirds, goatsuckers, and
swifts. It is what Coues calls a “ miscellaneous assortment, grouped
together more because they differ from other birds in one way or
another, than on account of their resemblance to one another.” Re-
cent anatomical studies have, however, shown the actual relationships
in many cases.
332 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Passing through the bird house one may be suddenly startled by
a loud, rapidly executed, and prolonged cackling laugh. This is
from the throat of the giant kingfisher, or laughing jackass (Dacelo
gigas), an Australian bird related to our common American king-
fisher, but of a decidedly greater size. Near by are representatives of
the hornbill family, found in the forests of Africa, India, and many
of the eastern islands, where they are hunted for food by the natives
of some districts. In many regions, however, these grotesque birds
are regarded with considerable superstitution and are rarely mo-
lested. These remarkable birds have a most curious nesting habit.
A large cavity in a tree is selected for the nest and the female horn-
bill is confined therein by a plaster wall, both birds apparently tak-
ing part in the process of masonry, which makes her a prisoner until
the young are hatched. During the incubation period she is fed by
the male through a small hole left in the wali, but is said to come
forth in a much emaciated and dung-bespattered condition.

In an inclosure near the big flight cage are some 15 specimens
of the great horned owl (Bubo virginianus), one of the largest of
the American birds of prey, as well as one of the most destructive
to smaller birds. Other owls, including the highly beneficial species
known as the screech owl (Otus asio), the barred owl (Striv varia),
and the barn owl (7Z'yto perlata pratincola) are also shown in large
cages. One of the handsomest of all owls is the great white, or
snowy owl (Vyctea nyctea). This is a diurnal species of the far
North, where it inhabits the open country of both continents. It
is expert in catching fish and feeds also on birds and mammals.
The snowy owl spends much of its time on the ground. During
severe winters numbers of snowy owls visit the northern United
States.

The toucans, large and sometimes brilliantly colored birds of
tropical America, are remarkable for their large bills. These are
not at all unwigldy, however, since they are very light in structure.
Toucans feed chiefly upon fruits, but also eat insects and the eggs
and young of other birds. Numerous species are known, some of the
most showy of which often reach the bird dealers, since toucans are
commonly taken by the natives as pets.

THE PERCHING BIRDS

More than half of all the species of birds known in the world be-
long to the order Passeriformes, frequently called the “ perching
birds,” and typified by the sparrows. There are numerous families
and the vast majority of species are small or medium sized birds;
the largest North American species are the crow and raven.
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—-HOLLISTER B33

In some of the larger cages of the bird house numerous species of
this order of birds are shown. There will be seen many of the more
familiar native species as well as rare and beautiful exotics. In
near-by cages are some of the larger representatives of the order.
including ravens, crows, magpies, and starlings from various cor-
ners of the earth. Among the most attractive of the smaller birds
are the numerous species of the finch or sparrow family, of which
the common canary (Serénus canarius) is a familiar member.

The weaver birds, native to Australia, India, and Africa, attract
a great deal of attention; this is especially true of the species known
as the paradise weaver (Steganura paradisea), which grows tail
feathers of great length in the breeding season.

The satin bower-bird (Ptilonorhynchus violaceus) and the Aus-
tralian catbird (Adluredus viridis) are interesting forms belonging
to the family of birds-of-paradise, which is not distantly related
to the crows. One of the most showy of all the perching birds ex-
hibited in the park is the cock-of-the-rock (Rupicola rupicola), a
bright orange species of tropical South America.

REPTILES

Reptiles (class Reptilia), as distinguished from mammals and
birds, are “ cold blooded.” The temperature of the animal is greatly
influenced or even regulated by that of the surrounding air, or of
the water in which it lives.

Three orders of reptiles are represented in the park collections.
These are the turtles and tortoises (Testudinata), alligators and
crocodiles (Loricata), and the lizards and snakes (Squamata).
One of the urgent requirements of the National Zoological Park is
a suitable reptile house, where larger collections of these interesting
creatures may be exhibited. At present the reptiles are kept in
quarters in the lion house.

TURTLES

Those turtles living entirely on land are often arbitrarily distin-
guished from the aquatic species (true turtles) and the semiaquatic
forms (terrapins) under the name tortoise. Some of the tortoises
are small in size, like our common box turtle of the Eastern States;
while others, particularly some of the island species, grow to an
immense size and are supposed to live to a greater age than any other
animals. These giant tortoises are now known only from a few
islands in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, on some of which they were
excessively abundant up to comparatively recent years. Visiting
ships have now so greatly reduced their numbers that on most of
the islands they are completely or almost exterminated. On certain
334 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

of the Galapagos Islands, some 500 miles off the coast of Ecuador,
giant tortoises were found in great numbers within the last century,
and on certain of the islands were fairly common less than 25 years
ago. In addition to the thousands carried away by vessels as food
for the crews, great numbers have been killed for the oil alone.

A number of species of giant tortoises have been described from
the Galapagos, and it is believed that most of the islands of the
archipelago have developed separate forms; and on at least one
island two distinct species were found, separated by a natural bar-
rier. The food of these curious creatures is chiefly grass, although
at certain seasons a great quantity of cactus is eaten. Mr. Edmund
Heller, who visited the Galapagos Islands in 1898 and 1899, collected
one specimen which had the whole palate and pharynx bristling with
cactus spines, and noted that the tortoises eagerly devoured the stems
and fruit of the cactus quite unmindful of the spines and apparently
without suffering. Heller states that the tortoises are quite active,
and though slow are so persistent, in their journeys that they cover
several miles a day.

Specimens of two species of Galapagos tortoises were obtained for
the park collection from the material collected by the Rothschild
expedition to the islands in 1897. The Albemarle Island tortoise
(Testudo vicint) is perhaps the largest living tortoise, and speci-
mens have been known which were over 4 feet in length and probably
weighed nearly 400 pounds. The Duncan Island tortoise (7. ephip-
pium) is somewhat smaller. <A third species of the giant Galapagos
Island tortoises from Indefatigable Island (7. porter?) was more
recently received through the interest of Dr. Frederic W. Goding,
consul general at Guayaquil, Ecuador. A smaller related tortoise
(7. denticulata) is from the continent of South America.

In the pine barrens of the Southern States, a comparatively large
tortoise, curious for its burrowing habits, is known as the gopher.
This species (Gopherus polyphemus) grows to a length of 15 inches
and a specimen almost of that size from peninsular Florida is on
exhibition. Like the giant tortoises, this species is herbivorous and
is particularly fond of fruits of various kinds. Related species
shown are found in the arid regions of the Southwest and other parts
of the world.

The common eastern tortoise or box turtle (Z'errapene carolina)
is found wild within the park. It is a smaller species than the
gopher, and the plastron or lower shell is so hinged as to permit the
animal when alarmed to close itself completely within its armor.

Specimens of the common native snapping turtle are sometimes
captured within the park. One of these reptiles caused considerable
damage among the waterfowl in the beaver pond before he was
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 335

finally caught by the keepers. The large specimen of a related, but
much rarer, species from Central America (Chelydra rossignonii)
was collected by Dr. Wm. M. Mann in Honduras.

ALLIGATORS

The common alligator of the Southern States (Alligator missis-
sippiensis) is well known to a large proportion of our people; thou-
sands of the young have been carried by tourists from Florida to all
parts of the United States. The species formerly was abundant in
fresh-water streams and swamps throughout its range—north to
North Carolina and west through the humid portions of Texas. In
all of the more accessible and settled portions this reptile has suffered
greatly from hunters, professional and amateur; and in most parts
of its former range it is now a rare thing to see an alligator of any
size. In some of the streams and swamps of the wilder places within
the Gulf States, however, it is still possible to find alligators from
6 to 8 or 9 feet in length; but the 10 to 16 foot reptiles are practically
gone.

The nest of the alligator has frequently been described to me by
old residents in Florida as resembling the nests made by the wild
“razorback” hogs of that country. It is a great mound of muck,
grass, moss, and sticks; placed in a retired spot, and is said sometimes
to be carefully guarded by the ‘female. The numerous eggs are _
hatched by heat generated by the rotting vegetation.

THE LIZARDS

Most of the American lizards are graceful and innocent creatures.
and many are beautifully colored. They are as much a delight to
students of reptiles as our warblers are to the ornithologists. There
are, however, two large species found in the Southwest and in Mex-
ico which are dangerous reptiles. They are known as the beaded
or tuberculated lizards, are sluggish creatures inhabiting arid situ-
ations, and are the only known poisonous lizards.

The Gila monster* (Heloderma suspectwm) is known only from
portions of Arizona, New Mexico, Sonora, and southern Nevada. It
is a comparatively large species, growing to 20 inches or more in
length. In color it is brown or blackish, marked with numerous
rings and blotches of yellow or orange. The upper parts are heavily
beaded or tuberculated; the tail is fat and stumpy, and the reptile
presents altogether a dangerous and terrifying appearance. On ac-
count of his notorious disposition and because of his poisonous bite,
the Gila monster is much dreaded by residents of the region in which
he lives, and the several specimens on exhibition attract great at-
tention. The poison glands are situated on the outer side of the
336 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

lower jaw near the tip. When biting the Gila monster holds on like
a bulldog so that the poison may have time to become absorbed in
the wound. No specific antidote is known.

Several species of the commoner lizards of small size, native to
the Southeastern States, are usually shown. The glossy blue-tailed
skink (Humeces quinquelineatus) is one of the most handsome of
the eastern forms. It is common in pine woods, especially in the
South. The rough-scaled species, known as the swift (Sceloporus
undulatus), and the little lizard, called the “ chameleon” (Anolis
carolinensis), are both abundant in favorable localities in many parts
of our Southern States. The latter species has the habit of changing
color and may be at times gray, green, or its normal shade of dull
brown.

The largest known lizards are the monitors, of Africa, Asia, and
Australia. They differ from other lizards in having the tongue
forked like a snake. Specimens of one species, Gould’s monitor
(Varanus gouldii) from Australia may be seen in the lion house.
This monitor grows to a length of nearly 6 feet and has a voracious
appetite; it eats eggs, chickens, and small mammals.

“ SNAKES

While it is probably true that the great majority of people dis-
like snakes, it is also true that a collection of these reptiles attracts
extraordinary attention and adds greatly to the interest in a zoolo-
gical park. The larger snakes in particular are a never-ceasing
source of wonder to visitors, and the more spectacular of the lesser
species, like the rattlesnakes, are almost as popular an exhibit.

One of the prize specimens in the snake department of the National
Zoological Park is a fine example of the anaconda (Hwnectes mu-
rinus), or water boa, of South America. The anaconda is the largest
of the American snakes and sometimes attains a length of over 20
feet. In color it is a yellowish green, marked with blackish spots.
Anacondas are essentially aquatic and spend much time in the water,
although they are perfectly at home in trees and are expert climbers.
The numerous young are born alive. The largest specimen in the
park collection has been here since August 17, 1899, and was a gift
from the governor of the State of Para, Brazil.

In a near-by cage are three specimens of the Indian python (Py-
thon molurus), native to India, the Malay Peninsula, and Java.
The largest snakes known are of a related species (P. reticulatus) ;
there are apparently reliable records of individuals over 30 feet in
length. A specimen 25 feet long is by far the largest snake on
exhibition in the National Zoological Park. This python feeds al-
most entirely on pigs, and sometimes, after a fast of six weeks, eats,

Smithsonian Report, 1923.—Hollister PLATE 29

GILA MONSTER

BULL SNAKE AND EaaGs
NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK—HOLLISTER 3837

within a few days, three young pigs weighing from 12 to 16 pounds
each. The reticulated python inhabits the Malay region and the
Philippines. Pythons, like the boas, are constrictors, and kill their
prey by crushing. The pythons lay eggs, which are hatched by the
mother who coils arounds them. The eggs number from 50 to 100.
These snakes are particularly fond of climbing, and the specimens in
the park collection spend much time coiled in the tops of the small
trees within their inclosure. The diamond snake (Python spilotes),
found only near the east coast of Australia, is blackish with a yellow
spot in the center of each scale. It is one of the most attractive of
the pythons in captivity and the specimens in the collection are much
more active than is usual with large snakes. A closely related form
known as the carpet snake hasa much wider distribution in Australia.

The common boa, or boa constrictor (Constrictor constrictor) is a
tropical American species of large size, but considerably smaller than »
the anaconda and the larger pythons. It is said rarely to reach a
length of 12 feet. Several examples are shown, the largest of which
came from Trinidad and is about 10 feet in length. A small specimen
of the boa was found in the Washington Market packed with a
bunch of bananas, and was sent to the park. This involuntary stowa-
way is doing nicely in his new home. Other species of boas are found
in South America, the West Indies, and, strangely enough, in
Madagascar.

Many species of North American snakes are usually on exhibition.
Most of these are of comparatively small size, but some of them
are of great beauty and others are interesting because of their terri-
ble appearance and deadly poison. In the latter class may be men-
tioned the rattlesnakes, copperheads, and moccasins.

The rattlesnakes are confined to America, where many species
are known, the majority of which are found in the western United
States. The common or banded rattler (Crotalus horridus) was
formerly found in many parts of the Eastern States, north into
Maine, but has now disappeared from much of its former range.
It sometimes grows to 5 feet or more in length. The largest rattler
is the diamond back (C. adamanteus), which in its typical form
in the Southern States reaches an immense size. Many specimens
are on record from Florida which measured over 6 feet in length,
and there are apparently authentic accounts of diamond backs of
between 8 and 9 feet. The bite of one of these large rattlers is very
likely to prove fatal.

Closely related to the rattlesnakes are the moccasin (Agkistrodon
piscivorus) and the copperhead (A. mokasen). Both are poisonous
species. The copperhead is one of the most dangerous snakes in
the Eastern and Southern States because he holds his own in thickly
settled communities; they are not uncommon about Washington,
338 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

especially along the upper Potomac above the city. Adult speci-

mens are commonly from 24 to 30 inches long. In color, the copper-
head is hazel brown, with a series of hourglass-shaped darker
blotches along the back. Equally venomous is the mocassin, or
cotton mouth, but he is an aquatic species and does not range so
far to the north as does thg copperhead.

The common water snake (Natrix sipedon) and the southern
water snake (JV. taxispilotus) are often mistaken for the moccasin;
they are ill-tempered snakes but harmless, and on close examination
may be distinguished from the moccasin and copperhead by the
absence of the deep “ pit” between the eye and nostril, a charac-
teristic feature of those venomous species and the rattlesnakes.

Other harmless American snakes kept in the collection are the
black snake (Coluber constrictor) sometimes called the “ blue racer,”
and his near relative, the coachwhip snake (CC. flagellum), both of
which sometimes attain a length of 5 feet. Several species of the
pretty little garter snakes, as well as the king snake, the pine snake,
chicken snake, bull snake, gopher snake, and others are commonly
shown.

THE BURROWING RODENTS OF CALIFORNIA AS
AGENTS IN SOIL FORMATION?

By JoSEPH GRINNELL

[With 3 plates]

The interrelations between vertebrate animals and their environ-
ments are exceedingly variable and far-reaching. ‘To base any con-
clusion upon a contrary assumption has proven dangerous, for in
specific cases such procedure has led people to expend effort and sub-
stance not only needlessly but definitely against their own best inter-
ests. An inference as to the relationships between some certain wild
mammal and human affairs may at first thought look to be perfectly
obvious and unquestionable. Extended examination, howéver, may
show that many factors previously overlooked are concerned, and
the comprehension of these may lead to an entirely different view.

The species and subspecies of mammals occurring in California, so
far as known at the present moment, number 410; 227 of these belong
to the order Rodentia. Of these, 109 are essentially burrowing ro-
dents; that is, they have their breeding quarters, at least, beneath
the surface of the ground, this circumstance entailing more or less
digging, and some of them spend practically all of their time within
their subterranean tunnels. These rodents of essentially burrowing
habit include the following groups: The ground squirrels, with 18
species; the kangaroo mice, with 2 species; the pocket mice, with 23
species; the kangaroo rats, with 33 species; and the pocket gophers,
with 33 species.

To express the above facts in more general terms: Of the total
number of species of mammals living within the confines of the
State, more than one-half are rodents, and of the rodents alone, just
one-half are of the burrowing category; rodents that burrow consti-
tute, by species, one-fourth of all the mammals in California. It
may further be observed that rodents which burrow are more or less
plentiful throughout the West. And here is another surprising fact,
namely, that only one of the seven genera of mammals to which our
burrowers belong is represented in the United States east of the

Mississippi River. (The genus C2tellus of ground squirrels furnishes
the exception; two species of that genus go as far east as Indiana.)
From a possibly economic bearing, with respect to digging, moles
and earthworms, though ecologically not at all homologous, seem to
take the place in the far eastern States that the burrowing rodents
take here.

The line of demarcation, eastward of which the burrowing type of
rodent begins to disappear, is, approximately, the one-hundredth
meridian. In other words, there is a north and south line of transi-
tion between two major faunal regions which roughly coincides with
this meridian. The limitations of the animals in question undoubt-
edly have to do with the physical peculiarities of the regions east
and west of the one-hundredth meridian. These peculiarities involve
differences in atmospheric humidity, in rainfall, and, of seeming
major importance, the sharp alternation of dry and wet season which
occurs to the westward. Linked up with these conditions, there is,
probably, in the West a relatively greater abundance of plants with
nutritious roots or thickened underground stems (corms, rootstocks) .

With regard to abundance of mammals in California by indi-
viduals, I have made numerous estimates. It proves to be highly
variable, all the way from zero per acre, as on parts of the floor of
Death Valley, up to 120 per acre, as in certain parts of the San
Diegan district. I have figured a conservative average throughout
the entire State to be 20 mammals of all sorts per acre, so that the
total mammal population in California, at the period of the year
just before the breeding season, when the population is at its lowest
ebb, is 2,000,000,000. Estimating further, on the basis of the results
of trapping and of field observation in different parts of the State,
I find that the populatton of burrowing rodents is at the very mini-
mum one-half that of a77 the mammals, which would thus be in the
ageregate about 1,000,000,000.

Even cursory observation suffices to establish to one’s satisfaction the
relative abundance of such burrowing types of mammals as ground
squirrels, pocket gophers, and kangaroo rats. Along any of the
railroads or highways, interminable stretches of the right of way,
or of the adjacent plains or mountain slopes, show a profusion of
the so-called “ workings” of these animals—mounds, trails, mouths
of burrows (open or closed), caved-in burrows, winter earth cores,
and the like. If a person starts out on foot, he will inevitably “ fall
into” subterranean runways: every little while he steps through
into some tunnel or cavern. The surface of the ground is seen to
be nearly covered with disturbed soil showing footprints of these
animals, especially if the season be the dry one. The vegetation
will show abundant evidence of having been foraged upon by ro-
dents.
RODENTS IN SOIL FORMATION—GRINNELL 841

Of the five types of burrowing rodents in California, the most
widespread, in the aggregate the most abundant, and certainly the
most effective in its equipment for turning over the soil, is the pocket
gopher (Z’homomys) ; and upon this type I propose chiefly to dwell.
An examination of a pocket gopher shows its structure throughout
to be remarkably specialized for burrowing into and through the
ground. A study of its habits shows that in all probability a pocket
gopher spends at least ninety-nine one-hundredths of its existence
below ground. Its world is limited by the earthen walls of a cylin-
der. In one direction this cylinder brings safety from enemies; at
the other end it brings accessibility to food. We find that the gopher
is deficient relatively to other rodents with respect to eyesight. Its
hearing is likewise below the average and seems to be keenest for
sounds of very low rate of vibration, such as jarrings of the ground.
Its sense of touch is localized not only in the nose and surrounding
vibrissee, but also at the tip of the tail. The animal moves quite as
well backward in its burrow as forward: it needs to be apprised of
conditions in both directions.

The body as a whole is short, thick through, with a notable mas-
siveness anteriorly—just the opposite of the litheness of structure
characteristic of, say, the squirrels. The head of a pocket gopher
is larger in proportion to its body than is that of any other land
mammal in California. The head is joined to the body without any
obvious neck constriction, and the shoulders are broad. ‘The bigness
of the head is accounted for both by the thicker and more ridged bones
of the skull and by the greater mass of the muscles attached to them.
These are correlated with the structure, position, and operation of
the relatively huge incisor teeth.

The mouth is a vertical slit, guarded by furry lips which are ap-
pressed so as to keep out, the earth loosened by the projecting incisor
teeth or pushed ahead of the animal by means of the face and fore-
feet. The pocket gopher is our only mammal in which the incisor
teeth can not be concealed within the lips.

Comparison of the pocket gopher, as an extreme type of digger,
with the California ground squirrel, which is also a digger but to a
far less degree, shows some significant differences. An average adult
California ground squirrel weighs 681 grams; an average adult male
pocket gopher weighs 170 grams, close to one-fourth as much. But
the weight of the skull of the ground squirrel is 7.8 grams, while
that of the gopher is 7.2 grams, practically the same. In other
words, the skull of a gopher is. four times as heavy as that of a
ground squirrel, total weights considered. The brain case, however,
seems to have relatively about the same capacity in the two animals.
The skull and teeth of the pocket gopher, together with the muscula-

1454—25——_23
342 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

ture connected with them, comprise the chief engine of digging. Its
operation results in cutting away, and in part transporting, the
earth, as the animal extends its underground system of passageways.
But there are also supplementary digging structures. Instead of the
hind feet being larger than the forefeet, as in most mammals, the
reverse is the case in the pocket gopher. We find the forefeet are
larger and provided with long stout curved claws; and the forearm
and shoulder are heavily muscled. Through and through, the adap-
tations of the pocket gopher are seen to be concentrated for the
digging function.

I have excavated several tunnel systems of gophers and have re-
corded the diameters in various portions of their courses, and the
volumes of the earth removed. I will not take space to give the
figures here. Suffice it to say that the ordinary runs maintain a
remarkably uniform diameter and depth below the surface of the
ground. The depth varies from 4 to 8 inches, depending upon the
consistency of the soil—clayey and coherent, or sandy and loose.
The deeper extensions of the burrows, down to a depth of 20 inches,
lead to the breeding chambers where the nests are located.

As already intimated, pocket gopheis appear above ground rather
seldom; they do so, as a rule, only as necessary to push out surplus
earth loosened in the extension of their tunnels or to forage in the
near vicinity of the open burrows. While gophers are active
throughout the entire 24 hours of the day, new surface workings,
marked by dark damp soil, are to be found chiefly in the morning.

The typical mound is of a fan shape, the opening of the burrow
from which the earth was pushed, although closed, being clearly
indicated at the base of the fan. The upraised surface of the fan
is marked by more or less sharply indicated concentric “ moraines,”
each registering the terminus of an operation from the mouth of
the burrow. The rim of the mound is often irregular, the earth
having been pushed farther out at some points on the periphery than
at others. The mouth of the burrow is plainly outlined in a perfect
circle of raised earth 2 to 3 inches in diameter, but this small
circle is always lower than the preponderance of the heap.

However, a great deal of the gophers’ activity at the surface of
the ground is not marked by the presence of mounds. Especially
during the dry season, one will find at frequent intervals circular
openings in the ground which have been filled with loose earth, nearly
or quite to the level of the surrounding surface. Examination will
show that these burrows have been used as exits from short side
branches of the main tunnels. They are used for the purpose of
exploring the immediately adjacent surface for food.

A gopher is loath to leave its shelter and ordinarily does not
venture as far even as the length of its body from the open mouth
RODENTS IN SOIL FORMATION—GRINNELL 343

of its burrow. As an evident result of this timidity, each feeding
exit is the center of a small circle, shorn of vegetation, the radius
of which is less than the body length of the gopher. The haunches
of the animal, when it forages, remain in contact with the orifice
of the burrow, as a sort of anchor by means of which the gopher
can pull itself back into safety at an instant’s warning. It is well
known to gardeners that a gopher will burrow underground to
some near-by plant, rather than risk capture by venturing forth
on the open surface. Many times gophers tunnel toward the sur-
face beneath plants and cut off roots and even main stems, without
any disturbance being evident above ground, until the plants begin to
wither and die, if they do not topple over before by reason of inse-
curity at the base.

In digging, the earth loosened by the strong incisor teeth and
stout front claws is swept back underneath the body until a con-
siderable amount has accumulated. The animal then turns around
(being able to do so apparently almost within the diameter of its
own body, which is the diameter also of its burrow), and pushes the
earth along the tunnel to the surface opening where it is shoved out
on top of the ground or into some other part of the burrow system
no longer of use. Only the fore feet, in conjunction with the broad
furry face below the level of the nose, are used in moving the earth.
The outside-opening, fur-lined, cheek pouches, with which the animal
is provided, and which are situated at each side of the mouth, are
not used to carry earth, but solely to carry clean food materials.
Most of the surface openings are at the ends of side tunnels and
are but a few inches in length. After excavation has proceeded a
few inches beyond one surface opening, this opening is closed and
a new one is made at a more convenient location—nearer the point
where the earth is being removed.

As already intimated, gophers occur very widely. In fact, in Cali-
fornia, we find them existing under the most extreme conditions of
climate, though different species are represented under the different
combinations of conditions. There are pocket gophers in abundance
in the vicinity of Yuma, and at Eureka; at Monterey, and around
Goose Lake; at Fresno, and up to the limit of plentiful plant growth,
11,500 feet, on the slopes of Mount Whitney.

I will now give some facts and information relative to the gophers
in the Yosemite National Park, where Mr. Tracy Irwin Storer and
myself have made definite studies of their habits.

The pocket gopher? is one of the few Sierran rodents that carry
on active existence throughout the entire year. It does not hibernate,

2The species here concerned is Thomomys monticola.
344 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

so far as we know, even at the highest altitudes. There is good evi-
dence of the continued work of gophers there, beneath the snow,
however deep this may become. During the winter and spring in the
high country, where the snow lies deep, they are led to adopt a some-
what different method in extending their tunnel systems than during
the summer months. The tunnels are then made in the snow itself,
a greater or less distance above, and in most of their courses more or
less parallel with, the surface of the ground. These snow tunnels are
usually greater in diameter than the subterranean runs, perhaps be-
cause of the loose texture of the snow as compared with that of the
soil beneath; they serve the purpose of allowing the gophers to reach
plants which are embedded in the snow. Many of them are used also
in extending the subterranean systems. The earth from below ground
is carried up and packed in the snow tunnels previously dug, thereby
forming solid earth cores above the level of the ground. When the
snow melts in the spring, these cores are lowered intact onto the sur-
face of the ground, where they often remain more or less recognizable
for several months, despite the winds and summer thundershowers.

The height to which the snow tunnels extend above the ground
depends upon the depth of the snow-fall; but there is reason to
believe that their general course is modified by the position of the
above-ground vegetation encountered. After the snow has gone, in
early spring, we have found portions of earth cores lying on top of
flattened branches of snowbush, on fallen tree branches, on logs and
rocks, indicating that the animals had pursued courses in the snow
well above these objects. When active right after a light fall of
snow, the gophers run their tunnels directly upon the surface of the
ground, appropriating to their uses as they go the stems of grasses
and other plants.

Very often the earth composing both the winter cores and the
summer mounds is quite different in appearance from that of the
superficial layer of the ground immediately underneath them. This
makes such “ workings” very conspicuous, as they are, with reference
to the ground on which they lie, in the relation of a geological un-
conformity.

Rather than being a drawback to the interests of the pocket gopher,
the snow seems to be of real benefit. Two factors are here involved.
I have referred to the timidity of the animal, and this is doubtless
due to the relentless pursuit of it by certain carnivorous mammals
and birds with the resultant precautions necessary on the part of
the gopher to keep out of sight and reach. The snow provides cover
which conceals the rodent effectually from certain of its enemies. At
the same time, the vertical range of accessible food sources is greatly
RODENTS IN SOIL FORMATION——GRINNELL 345

increased; for the gopher is able to reach plant stems and leaves en-
veloped in the snow mantle, many inches and even feet above the
ground surface. All this is subject to confirmation through study of
the winter workings uncovered at the time of the spring thaw.

Some estimates made by us while carrying on field work near Por-
cupine Flat, Yosemite Park, will serve to indicate the amount of
work done by pocket gophers. It was found that the average amount
of earth put up in the form of winter cores was, on a selected area,
1.64 pounds per square yard. Assuming that, on the average, gopher
workings covered only one-tenth per cent of the land surface, there
would be 3.6 tons of earth put up per square mile, or 4,132 tons over
the whole park. This is for a single winter! It will be recalled that
there are many square miles of either solid rock or slide rock in the
park, where gophers can not work. On the other hand, in favorable
localities workings occur on every square yard of surface; so that it is
believed that the average of one-tenth per cent is conservative for
the park as a whole. In summer the amount of material excavated
is probably at least as great as that in winter—exactly how much has
not yet been determined. For the year, Mr. Storer and myself feel
safe in doubling the total figure just given, which, in another unit of
measure, would be close to 160 carloads of 50 tons each. We estimate
further that the earth to the above amount is lifted by the gophers
an average distance of about 8 inches; 5,500 foot-tons of energy
are expended by these little animals in Yosemite Park during a single
year.

The question then presents itself as to the general effect of all this
' work upon the terrain at large, and further upon the vegetation and
even upon the animal life of the region. I will proceed to enumerate
some of these relations which seem to be borne by pocket gophers to
their environment.

(1) The weathering of the substratum is hastened by the burrow
systems carrying the air and the water and contained solvents to the .
subsoil particles and rock masses below.

(2) The subsoil is comminuted and brought to the surface where
it is exposed to further, and increased rate of, weathering.

(3) The loose earth brought up and piled on the surface of the
ground thereby becomes available for transportation by wind and
water; rain and melted snow carry it from the slopes down to fill up
glacial depressions and to make meadows of them; and when these are
full, the sediment is carried on still farther by the gathering streams
to contribute to the upbuilding of the great and fertile valleys beyond
the foothills.

(4) Water is conserved for the reason that snow melts more
slowly on porous ground than on hard-packed soil or bare rock, so
846 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

that the spring run-off is retarded and the supply to the streams below
is distributed over a longer period of time; furthermore, the porous
soil retains the water longer than packed ground and gives it up with
corresponding slowness. Spring floods are less lable to occur and a
more regular water supply is insured to the lowlands. .

(5) A porous, moist soil produces a fuller vegetational cover—
forest, brushland and meadow—and this again favors water con-
servation.

(6) The ground is rendered more fertile through the loosening of
the soil as well as through the permeation of it by the tunnels them-
selves, thereby admitting both air and water to the roots of the
plants; the mineral constituents of the soil become more readily
available, and the rootlets are better able to penetrate the earth.

(7) The accumulated vegetational débris on the surface of the
ground is eventually buried by the soil brought from below by the
gophers, and becomes incorporated to form the humus content so
favorable for the successful growth of most kinds of plants.

My readers will have been reminded by a portion of the above
considerations of Darwin’s classical study of the relation of earth-
worms to soil formation. There is undoubtedly a parallel here, the

more significant in that the earthworm is a relatively rare animal in
' California; and what earthworms are here are of small size and
of relative inconsequence in effect upon the soil. The pocket gopher
is wonderfully equipped to handle the refractory young soils of the
semiarid Sierran slopes, and his réle here is, in a way, that of Dar-
win’s earthworm in England.

The greatest of all agencies of erosion in the Sierra Nevada, the
glaciers, so stressed by John Muir, have now ceased to operate, and
the less obvious agencies come into prominence. The element of time
granted, we are able to conceive of vast accomplishments on the part
of even so humble a contributor as the pocket gopher. Gophers have
been at work as gophers of modern type since Miocene times. Prof.
Andrew C. Lawson thinks that the Sierran block had not begun
to uptilt until early Pliocene. Gophers have probably been at work
on at least the lower slopes a good share of the entire time occupied in
the uplift of the Sierra Nevada.

As in the case of Darwin’s earthworms, there is plentiful evidence
in California as to the function of burrowing rodents in burying
large objects, such as rocks and logs. Ground squirrels and pocket
gophers both show an inclination toward placing their nesting cham-
bers beneath objects that will protect them from being dug out by
burrowing enemies, such as badgers and coyotes. The earth is taken
out from beneath a rock or a boulder by the rodents and deposited
RODENTS IN SOIL FORMATION—GRINNELL 347

around the margin of the object, which thus, as the years go by,
gradually disappears, as a result of the process of undermining and
settling plus that of the building up of the ground roundabout. The
seeker need not go far to find good cases of this kind. Mr. Joseph
Dixon cites the case of a rock pile on one corner of his ranch which
was half buried in 10 years. One certain rock settled 6 inches in
comparison with the general land level during a period of 10 years.

Some idea of the extent of the work which gophers have ac-
complished through time may be gained from the following consid-
erations. There are 33 species and subspecies of this type of bur-
rowing rodent now in existence in California; these are all in a
general way similar to one another, but each has distinctive charac-
ters which involve not only external features of color and quality -
of pelage but also internal structures, more especially those of the
skull and teeth. These latter features, it will be observed, have to
do with the digging equipment which to the gopher is of such vital
importance. These characters of skull and teeth are the ones chiefly
depended upon by systematic students in determining species. A
remarkable thing is that no two of the 33 species occurring in Cali-
fornia exist in any one locality. Just one kind lives in a place, to the
exclusion of all other kinds. There is probably close correlation of
structure with peculiarities of the terrain, as, for instance, those
shown by loamy, sandy, and rocky soils.

Now the remains of gophers’ skulls are found in abundance in the
Rancho La Brea deposits near Los Angeles. The exact horizon in
which they are found is that in which are also found the saber-toothed
tiger, the ground sloth, camels, mastodons, and dire wolves. That
horizon has been assigned to the Pleistocene epoch; and geologists
have estimated that the time elapsed since the deposit of the materials
representative of that horizon is to be computed in “ tens and even
hundreds of thousands of years.” A remarkable thing is that a study
I have just made of the gophers of Rancho La Brea, in comparison
with the species existing in the same vicinity to-day, shows they are
identical in every respect. In, say, 200,000 years there has been no
modification of the same structures which at the present day vary
from place to place to such an extent as to have led this group to
be characterized by some zoologists as extraordinarily “ plastic.”
The true inference here is that the processes of divergent evolution,
as well as of monotypic evolution, have been exceedingly slow. This,
however, is somewhat beside the issue.

If we are to grant that gophers have been in existence, carrying on
their digging operations for so short a time, geologically, as 200,000

°The species and subspecies is Zhomomys botte pallescens.
348 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

years, even then the total amount of turnover of the ground has
been enormous. At the rate determined on one tract of land to
be one-tenth of an inch per year, it would in that period of time have
amounted to 1,700 feet. This is equivalent to 3,400 plowings to a
depth of 6 inches.

Computations of this sort may be carried on endlessly, and it is
rather good fun to do so for a while; but beyond certain limits, they
are not particularly profitable In this case, especially, there is a wide
margin of inaccuracy when an attempt is made to apply the initial
figure over large areas.

Interestingly enough, our studies have shown that the average
depth at which pocket gophers run their burrows beneath the sur-
face of the ground is 6 inches. And this, I am informed by Prof.
John S. Burd, is the usual depth reached by the farmer of California
when he plows the land for his crops. Not only does the gopher
bring raw soil to the surface to be further weathered, thus releasing
the mineral food that the plants require, but it is continually bury-
ing vegetation beneath the earth which it throws up at the mouths
of its burrows; and furthermore, vegetation is cut into pieces and
carried below ground in large quantities by gophers, much of which
is not eaten but remains there, just as does the vegetation which is
turned under by the plow, to add to the humus content of the soil.
All the excreta of a pocket gopher are deposited underground in
special branches of its tunnel system, also at about the same critical
depth—6 inches. The nitrogenous supply from this animal is thus
not wasted in any such proportion as it is in the case of those her-
bivores which live altogether on the surface of the ground. It must
be emphasized that it is on wé/d land, land that is untouched by the
farmer, that the gophers thus serve in a valuable way as enrichers of
the soil.

While the gopher and ground squirrel when they eat grass admit-
tedly come into direct competition with horses, cattle, and sheep, the
story does not stop there. An important function, it seems to me,
performed by burrowing animals is that of counteracting the pack-
ing effect of large mammals on uncultivated grazing lands. The
impact of heavy feet on the soil, especially when wet, crowds the
particles together and renders the earth less suitable for plant
growth. Close tamping tends to exclude the air and hence to sufto-
cate the plant roots, to which oxygen is as essential as it is to animal
life. One has but to observe the conditions on mountain meadows
outside the limits of national parks to appreciate the point here
made. Often where the countrv has been overstocked with cattle or
RODENTS IN SOIL FORMATION—GRINNELL 849

domestic sheep, the grasslands have become poor—the crop of grass
is serawny—eacept where gopher workings occur; the sites of these
are marked by patches of vivid green. Indeed, on ordinary hill
slopes I have repeatedly noted the rejuvenation of the plant cover
here and there, traceable directly and obviously to the activity of
burrowing rodents. Before the advent of the white man with his
cattle and horses a similar service was rendered, though in lesser
degree, perhaps, because of the less need for it, when the deer, moun-
tain sheep, and bears frequented the same areas.

The question of damage-to forests under natural conditions, for
example, injury to young trees, is one that has been raised by for-
esters. There is no doubt but that gophers and squirrels do girdle
or cut off the stems of many seedlings and thus terminate the exist-
ence of numerous individual trees. But the great number of seed-
lings observable on parts of any forest floor, vastly more than could
ever reach maturity, would seem to indicate that an adjustment in
this direction had been reached long ages ago. Plants in general
provide for a rate of replacement sufficient to meet the maximum
probabilities of casualty, this involving all stages from the seed to
the mature fruiting plant.

In the arable lowlands of California the pocket gopher is well-
nigh universally, and of course there rightly, condemned for pur-
suing his activities, in making his living, on lands that have been
appropriated and cultivated by man. There, man has disturbed the
original balance of natural relations between plants and animals;
he aims to make the land produce crops of selected plants in the
largest measure possible, and to that end he cultivates the ground
himself by very effective “artificial” means. He naturally resents
the levy upon the land and its products by any other animal. Most
of the original quota of herbivorous mammals has been crowded out
by his methods; but the gopher and eround squirrel have been able
to persist ie the changed conditions. Man’s crops have even in-
creased their food resources; and they have been able to cape with
the other changes. It is clear that we have here, most surely, a
reversal of the relationships obtaining in the wild. On wild land
there zs no cultivation in the “ artificial” sense. The crops of wild
plants—grasses, herbs, shrubs, and even trees—depend upon what-
ever favorable agencies operate in natural ways. The happy rela-
tion found by our pioneers was the result of eons of adjustment
among all of the elements concerned.

We grant that the farmer must combat the gopher and ground
squirrel in his fields and gardens; we sympathize with him for
yearning for the total eradication of the rodents there; and we will

1454—25-——_24
350 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

help him in every conceivable way to control them. But we do not
agree with the policy of wholesale extermination advocated by some
persons for all areas alike. We hold that our native plant life, on
hill and mountainside, in canyon and mountain meadow, would soon
begin to depreciate, were the gopher population completely de-
stroyed. Not that such a thing is at all possible; but that it should
not be thought of, even, by any intelligent person who seeks to in-
terpret nature correctly. Much less should public money be spent
for such a purpose. On wild land the burrowing rodent is one of ©
the necessary factors in the system of natural well-being.

THE NATURAL HISTORY OF CHINA?
By ARTHUR DE CABLE Sowersy, F.R.G.S., F.Z.S.

[With 4 plates]

The subject we have before us is a very big one, far too big for
anything approaching justice to be done to it in the time at our
disposal. It may even be argued that the time is not ripe for any-
one to attempt to deal with the natural history of China as a whole;
that our knowledge of the subject is still too fragmentary ; that it is
both unsafe and unwise to try and form any far-reaching theories
as to the origin, distribution, past and present, and the present status
of the animals that inhabit this part of the great Asiatic land mass;
in short, that a great deal more research work has to be done, both
in the field and laboratory, before a general survey of the fauna
of this ancient land can be brought within the compass of a single
discussion.

This, to a certain extent, is true, for there undoubtedly remains a
vast amount of work to be done in China before it may be said
that even the vertebrates are all known; while a much greater time
must elapse before the invertebrate fauna has been thoroughly ex-
plored. Nevertheless it is utterly erroneous, not to say unfair to
past workers in this wide field of research, to say, as has been done
recently, that the natural history of China is practically unknown.
It is true that in certain groups of animals, for the most part orders
or families of invertebrates, the Chinese representatives are un-
known, but our knowledge of others, birds for instance, is actually
nearing completion, and it is hoped to show here that this knowl-
edge, coupled with what we know of the faunas of other countries
and their distribution throughout the ages, is amply sufficient to en-
able us to draw conclusions and put forward theories, tentative
though they be, in regard to that of China.

China is a very big country and comprises within her boundaries
a very varied topography and many kinds of climates. In the west
mighty mountains rise to heights far above the snow line; in the
northeast lie immense alluvial plains; in the south and southeast
the country is all broken up by irregular systems of hills and low

Asiatic Society, Vol, LIII, 1922,

351
352 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

mountains. Mighty rivers traverse the land from end to end, cutting
through mountain ranges to form deep gorges, or widening their
beds to form great valleys. In the north a temperate climate pre-
vails, a warm summer being followed by a bitterly cold winter, while
in the south tropical conditions are met with. The climate of the
north may be characterized as dry, that of central China as humid,
that of the southwest as distinctly wet. The result of all this is the
presence of an extremely varied fauna, not only in regard to the
species and genera of the families and orders represented, but in
those families and orders themselves.

Another factor which helps to bring about this wonderful variety
in the fauna of China is the age of the country. It is customary,
when discussing the Chinese, to credit them with a very ancient
civilization, but geologists tell us that the antiquity of China’s civili-
zation pales into insignificance as a world wonder when compared
with that of her rock formations: It is not meant to suggest by
this that the animals found in the ancient rocks have survived to
the present time, but that in China we find animals still living that
belong to very old groups. Even in the case of warm-blooded verte-
brates, which, geologically speaking, are very recent, we find species
belonging to a bygone age, an age that we call prehistoric. We
find animals that belong to an age when man used only stone imple-
ments, and lived in cave shelters, the Paleolithic age. Such animals
have only survived in these regions by taking shelter in the highest
mountain ranges. The famous takin (Budorcas) is one of these,
the giant panda, or cat-bear (Adluropus melanoleucus) another.
The lagomorphs—pikas and hares—belong to this group, as also do
certain of the rodents, such as the allactaga, or jumping rat, and
some of the voles.

Thus it has become customary for naturalists in the museums of
Europe and America to look for and expect all kinds of remark-
able forms of animals from China, and, periodically, some such ani-
mal is discovered. This happens in all branches of animal life. A
typical example is that of two species of flea. A rat was caught
somewhere in South China, and it was found to contain specimens of
a peculiar jigger flea in its ears. These specimens were lost, and
never again have similar ones been found. Quite by accident some
white maggotlike creatures were found in the nostrils of a roe deer
that I shot while on the Clark Expedition in Shensi. These were kept
and later were examined at the British Museum, when it was found
that they were enormously swollen females of a small black flea
that infested the coat of the deer upon which they were found. The
species has not since been secured. Other peculiar Chinese animals
will be mentioned later; for the present let us continue for a moment

eS a
NATURAL HISTORY OF CHINA—-SOWERBY 353

to consider the paleontological side of our subject, since this bears
so strongly upon the present distribution of the animals of China.

It may be taken that a fair amount is known about the fossils
that occur in the older formations, since several able paleontologists
have been devoting their time to this branch of study. A geological
museum has been started in Peking, as well as a geological survey
of the whole of China, and already a considerable amount of valuable
material upon which experts are now working has been gathered.
It is the more recent formations, however, that most interest us here,
since it is from them that we may find out when the animals we
now know to exist in the country arrived there, and also what forms
immediately preceded them. Unfortunately these recent deposits
have not as yet been well worked or explored, though some inter-
esting results have already been obtained. Thus we learn that the
porcupine, now not known to occur north of the Yangtse Valley,
once inhabited the province of Chihli, numerous remains of the
animal having been found in recent deposits round Peking. Such
a discovery is significant, for it shows that at no very distant date,
geologically speaking, that part of China had a very much warmer
climate than it has now. Couple with this fact my recent discovery
in the imperial hunting grounds of northeastern Chihli, of a species
of squirrel (Z'amiops), which belongs to a genus that does not occur
elsewhere in China north of Ssuchuan in the west and Chekiang in
the east, and it becomes obvious that the forests of west, central,
southwest, and northeast China were at one time connected, a belt
of heavy vegetation and trees probably extending all the way from
Indo-China to the borders of Manchuria.

While exploring in Manchuria, I secured a specimen of a large
bear that could not be classed either with the brown or the black
bears of Asia. It was undoubtedly a grizzly, but up to that time
the living grizzlies were supposed to be confined to North America.
I was able to show that this bear was indeed a true grizzly, and also
that there were other grizzlies in Asia. This very clearly shows
how the grizzlies came to be present in North America, for these
Asiatic forms are undoubtedly connecting links between the pre-
historic grizzlies or cave bears of England and western Europe,
which became extinct only after the fourth glaciation, and the
living grizzlies of North America. The only way in which the
latter could have acquired their present distribution was by the mi-
gration or, perhaps it would be better to say, the gradual spread,
of their ancestors from Europe across Siberia or central Asia to
the American continent by way of the land bridge that once existed
where the Bering Sea now lies.

This land bridge was a very important factor in the present
distribution of the animals of both America and the Eurasian land
354 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

mass. By its means such animals as the camel and the horse, both
of which first developed in North America, and subsequently be-
came extinct in that continent, arrived in Asia, the horse passing on
to Europe, where it became the servant of man, and was subse-
quently reintroduced into America by him.

When we come to examine the distribution of the cold-blooded
vertebrates, such as reptiles and fishes, we have to go further back
in the geological history of the country in order to understand its
significance, and it is here that our want of knowledge is most keenly
felt. Nevertheless, a few interesting facts may be culled from what
we already know, facts which throw a certain amount of light upon
the subject.

An examination of the map of the Old World will reveal the fact
that a desert belt stretches from Morocco in North Africa right
across Asia to the borders of Manchuria, where it stops within a
hundred miles or so of the sea. It has been suggested that it was
this desert belt, known to be of considerable age, that prevented the
Urodela, or tailed amphibians, from spreading south from Europe
and north Asia into Africa and India. Force is given to this con-
tention by the fact that it is only in the extreme eastern part of
their range in Eurasia that they occur south of the desert belt in
question, for there they found a stretch of humid country by
means of which they could spread southward with safety. It is
easy to see how such animals as newts and salamanders, which de-
pend entirely upon the presence of ponds, streams, or lakes, wherein
to lay their eggs and where their young develop, and which them-
selves can not exist in any but a humid environment, would find it
utterly impossible to cross a stretch of dry, sandy desert.

Incidentally it may be mentioned that another animal that appears
to have been influenced in its distribution by this desert belt is
the roedeer (Capreolus), whose range extends from the extreme west
of Europe throughout that continent, central Asia, north of the
deserts, and Siberia into Manchuria. Thence it turns south and west,
extending into north China and on into eastern Tibet. This deer
does not occur in central or south China, its range being bounded
in this direction by the Tsing Ling Mountains.

Reptiles represent a very old group of animals. One instance in
connection with their ancestry and distribution may be mentioned
here. It is that of the little Yangtse alligator. The Crocodilide
represent almost the very oldest living group of reptiles, and they
ucquired their distribution upon the face of the earth a very long
time ago. It is believed that they originated in the Old World,
spreading into the New World at a very remote period. These
New World members of the group are mainly alligators or caimens,
NATURAL HISTORY OF CHINA—SOWERBY 355

though true crocodiles are also found in American waters. Since,
however, there is one alligator to be found in the Old World, that
from the Yangtse, it is obvious that at one time this genus enjoyed
a very wide distribution in both the Old and the New Worlds, and
that in some way the Old and the New Worlds were connected at that
time.

Paleontology has proved of the utmost assistance in determin-
ing how the distribution of fishes, both marine and fresh-water,
came about, though as yet nothing very important in the way of
fossil remains of this type of cold-blooded vertebrate has been found
in Chinese strata. Nevertheless, it is believed that China formed a
center of dispersal for the great carp family (Cyprindde), receiv-
ing at the same time an influx of Silurids, or catfishes, from the
region of the Indian Ocean.

We may next consider for a while the question of the faunistic
areas that occur in China, or to which parts of China belong. Many
years ago a distinguished naturalist divided the globe up into great.
faunistic regions such as the Palearctic, including practically the
whole of Europe, and central and northern Asia, the Ethiopian, in-
cluding Africa south of the Sahara, the Oriental, including India
and Malay, and the Nearctic, including North America. Since that
time it has become customary to go on dividing up these regions into
subregions or faunistic provinces, often, it must be admitted, with
but poor success. Notwithstanding this fact, we may make some
such attempt in the case of China, for, even if certain groups of
animals are not amenable to such a treatment, others undoubtedly
are, and it will greatly assist us in our examination of the Chinese
animals if we can discover the presence of such faunistic areas.

As a matter of fact the task is not a difficult one, for some very
striking faunistic barriers occur in China. One of these is the great
Tsing Ling divide that extends from the highlands of the Tibetan
border through southern Kansu, and southern Shensi into Honan.
North .of this divide we have one group of animals, south of it
another. It forms the boundary line of the ranges of a large number
of both mammals and reptiles. For instance, we have already seen
how it marks the southerly limits of the range of the roe deer. At
the same time it forms the northerly limit of the range of the
muntjac, another small deer, and the porcupine. To the north of it
the animals are Tartarian in their affinities, to the south they are
oriental. In the Provinces of Kansu, north Shensi, Shansi, Chihli,
and Fengtien, the westernmost Province of Manchuria, we find such
animals as the allactaga, the suslik, the gazelle, the wild sheep,
animals which denote the intrusion of a Steppe fauna. At the same
time we have the roe deer, the wapiti, or red deer, the wild boar.
856 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

and the fur squirrel, which suggest a forest fauna, and connect this
part of the country, faunistically, with Europe by way of Manchuria
and Siberia.

Central China, which may be taken as coinciding roughly with the
basin of the Yang-tse-Kiang, is again characterized by the presence
of certain forms, while when we come to the extreme south we find
typically Indian or Malayan animals appearing. The animals of
central China seem to have spread eastward and northward to a
certain extent, which accounts for an intrusion of oriental species
into Manchuria, as for instance the black bear and the sika deer.
These may, however, have arrived in Manchuria from south China
by way of the low-lying coastal provinces of the east. In any case
we are fairly safe in dividing China up into three main faunistic
areas, north, central, and south, noting that the northern animals
are partially Tartarian, or Mongolian, the animals of central China
being typically Chinese, and those of the south being partially Indian
or Malayan. And there we may leave the matter, since nothing is
to be gained by stressing the point too far.

Before making a rapid survey of the more prominent and interest-
ing orders, families, genera, and species of animals occurring in China,
it would be well to consider briefly the work done upon our subject
by past field naturalists, experts in the museums of Europe and
America, and others, at the same time taking note of the literature
that is extant. The names of men like Pére David, a Jesuit mis-
sionary who traveled over a great part of China studying the fauna
and making collections which were sent to the Paris Museum, and
Robert Swinhoe, a British consul, who also was a keen student and
collector, stand foremost in the annals of the zoology of this coun-
try. David’s material was worked out, as regards the mammals, by
Milne-Edwards, the results being published in a fine tome called
‘“‘ Recherches sur les Mammiferes,” and, as regards the birds, by him-
self and Oustalet in their “Les Oiseaux de la Chine.” Swinhoe’s
writings appeared for the most part in the Ibis, the organ of the
British Ornithologists’ Union, sometimes in the Proceedings of the
Zoological Society of London. Since their time very little sound
work was done upon the mammals till about the year 1907, when
Mr. Malcolm P. Anderson, working for the British Museum, came
to China and commenced a series of explorations, making magnificent
collections, which were worked out by Mr. Oldfield Thomas, of that
institution, who published numerous papers in the P. Z. S. and the
Annals and Magazine of Natural History. The birds, on the
other hand, have claimed many devoted students, amongst the most
famous of whom are C. B. Rickett, J. D. de La Touche, and F. W.
Styan. These ornithologists have contributed very considerably to
NATURAL HISTORY OF CHINA—SOWERBY 357

our knowledge of the birds of China, their published papers appear-
ing usually either in the Ibis or the Bulletin of the British Ornithol-
ogists’ Club.

A naturalist whose name must be mentioned was Pére P. M. Heude,
founder and first curator of the Zikawei Museum of Natural History.
He managed to get together a very fine collection of Chinese animals,
and published extensively upon the material that he gathered round
him in the museum. Unfortunately he entertained somewhat peculiar
views upon what constitutes a species, which led him to describe an
enormous number of new forms on grounds that no modern naturalist
can accept. Thus the value of his writings was seriously impaired,
though the fine series of specimens in the museum remain a monu-
ment to his zeal as a curator and collector. His principal publication
was his “Memoires concernant l’Histoire Naturelle de Empire
Chinois,” and he dealt mainly with mammals, though birds, certain
reptiles, and certain fresh-water mollusks were also touched upon.

As regards the cold-blooded vertebrates of China, the most im-
portant names are those of G. A. Boulenger and C. Tate Regan, of
the British Museum, and L. Stejneger, of tle United States National
Museum, whose writings upon the fresh-water fish, amphibians, and
reptiles are to be found scattered through numerous scientific jour-
nals. The earlier workers upon the reptiles and batrachians were
Cantor and Giinther, and upon the fishes Giinther, Valenciennes,
Bleeker, Basilewsky, and Richardson.

Besides all these naturalists, there are a great number who have
contributed to the literature upon the zoology of China, but it is
impossible here to give all their names, or even an adequate idea of
the vastness of that literature. A partial bibliography of the orni-
thology of China, which Doctor Richmond, of the United States Na-
tional Museum, very kindly prepared at my request, contains the
titles of over 700 publications, which are scattered throughout numer-
ous journals, or have appeared in book form. It is almost certain
that no library in the world contains a complete set of all the pub-
lications upon the fauna of China, though that of the Natural His-
tory Museum at South Kensington (British Museum) is remarkably
replete with this form of literature. The libraries in China, alas,
contain very little in this line, far too little to enable anything serious
in the way of research work to be done. The geological department
in Peking is trying to form a good working library, while the Zikawei
Museum has a fairly useful one. The library of the late Dr. G. E.
Morrison, of Peking, contained a good collection of zoological works
on China, but it was sold and taken away to Japan. This lack of
the literature upon the subject is a very serious handicap to anyone
trying to do original research in the country, while another serious
358 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

handicap is the lack of collected material in the way of good series
of properly labeled specimens for purposes of comparison. I should
like to see an awakening of the interests of the members of the Royal
Asiatic Society (north China’branch) in regard to this matter, for
this institution is obviously the one to lead the way, in this part of
China at least, in the study of the zoology of the country, and all
that is needed are adequate funds for the purchase of books and
papers and to send collectors out into the field to gather more ma-
terial. The society’s museum already has a considerable amount of
valuable material, but much more is needed before it can be con-
sidered as a genuine working museum rather than a show place.

MAMMALS

The mammalia of China is a comparatively large and varied one.
It contains representatives of numerous families and genera, some
of them unique, and most of them extremely interesting. Probably
the great order Rodentia is most fully represented, though the Car-
nivora are extremely abundant, especially in some localities. The
Ungulata, or hoofed animals, on the other hand, are less plentiful,
a fact due doubtless to their value as food. The Chinese are not to
be classed among the world’s best hunters; but by reason of their
numbers, and the fact that they never lose an opportunity to turn
an honest penny, they soon destroy the big game in any district
where such occur and they are allowed to hunt it. At the present
time it is only in remote mountainous areas, more or less inaccessible
to the outside world, that any of the larger ungulates are to be found
in a wild state, and even these are being assidulously hunted by local
natives, who are gradually acquiring modern rifles, and so threaten-
‘ing them with extermination. To this category belong the Asiatic
wapiti, or red deer, several forms of which occur in the country,
the wild sheep, the takin, the serow, the sika deer, and the goral.
The large deer are hunted for the sake of their horns when in velvet.
the Chinese believing in this commodity as an excellent tonic and
rejuvenator. Thus the spotted deer, or sika, have become extremely
rare, and are now only to be found in a few isolated areas. The
sika deer form an interesting genus that is confined to the south-
eastern part of the Asiatic land mass and adjacent islands. There
are two distinct subgroups within the genus, one containing the large
animals of north China and Manchuria, and the other small animals,
typified by the little Japanese deer. In the extreme southwest of
China we find an Indian form of deer, the sambhur, while in the
Yangtse Valley occurs the remarkable little river deer (Hydropotes
inermis), which has no horns, but well developed tusks in the male.
Muntjacs, musk, mouse deer, and roe deer complete the list of cervine
ungulates that occur in China, the roe being confined to the north,
NATURAL HISTORY OF CHINA—SOWERBY 859

the musk to the north and west, and the others to the central and
southern parts. The famous David’s deer (Hlaphurus davidianus),
known to the Chinese as the Mei, or Ssu-puhsiang, meaning the
“ four unlikes,” has become extinct, at least in a wild state. This
and the river deer are purely Chinese forms, the wapiti being Euro-
pean and North American in its affinities, the musk Himalayan, and
the sika, the muntjacs, and the mouse deer oriental.

Wild swine of the Sus scrofa type are almost universally distrib-
uted throughout the country. Antelopes and wild sheep belong to
the north, the serows and gorals to the highlands, where such occur,
and the takins to the highest mountain ranges of central and west
China. The yak occurs in a wild state in the highlands on the
Tibetan border, and the wild ass in Chinese Turkestan.

The Carnivora are represented by several important groups,
namely, the Ursidae, or bears; the Canidae, wolves, foxes, and dogs;
the Mustelidae, or weasels and their relations; and the Felidae, or
cats. It would be interesting to follow out the various branches of
this order, but neither time nor space will permit of it. Sufficient it
is to note that in this group of mammals, as in the last, China
possesses some remarkable forms all her own. Such an animal is
the great panda, or cat bear (Adluropus melanolecus) of the Tibetan
borders. The small panda (Azlurus fulgens) is another. The tiger
was at one time, as the leopard is to-day, almost universally dis-
tribfted, but now it is only rarely found in the north and central
regions, though one form is common in the south and southeast,
while the Manchurian forests contain numbers of the great woolly
tiger. Small cats and civets are extremely abundant in the south-
east; less so in other parts.

Of the Chinese rodents the most interesting are some of the voles
and their not very distant relations the molerats (Myospalax) and
the bamboo rat (Aisomys). It is perfectly obvious from a com-
parison of the two forms that the molerat is a development from the
bamboo rat, it having carried the specializations of the latter for a
subterranean life a considerable step further. The bamboo rat, living
in the dense jungle where it burrows for its food, the roots and
shoots of the sword-grass, frequently stays above ground since it is
well protected by the heavy vegetation. The molerat, on the other
hand, having pushed northward, where vegetation is very much
more scarce, has been forced to become almost exclusively subter-
ranean in its habits and mode of life, and thus has become even more
molelike than the bamboo rat, developing larger burrowing claws in
the forepaws, and almost losing the external ear and the eye. In
central, south, and west China all kinds of rats, more or less related
to the common rat, predominate, but in the north we have an intru-
sion of Mongolian or Steppe forms, such as the jumping rats, Dipus
360 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

and Allactaga, the gerbils (Meriones), and the ground squirrel
(Oitellus). Here also are to be found the various members of the
hamster family, rats characterized by the presence of large cheek
pouches. Squirrels are universally distributed, characteristic forms
being the huge flying squirrels, David’s squirrel, the fur squirrels,
and the chipmunks. The largest rodent in the country is the porcu-
pine (Hystrix), which occurs throughout the Yangtse Valley and in
south and west China.

Closely related to the rodents are the lagomorphs, or hares and
pikas. These used to be classed with the rodents, but are now looked
upon as belonging to a different order, whose development was,
nevertheless, closely parallel. There are numerous subspecies of the
common hare (Lepus swinhoei) in China north of the Yangtse.
South of that river occurs a totally different animal, namely the
Chinese hare (ZL. sénensis). This is a rather unique distribution and
division of habitats, since the rim of the Yangtse basin and not the
river itself usually forms the boundary line between the ranges of
any two forms of animal in China. Apparently the Yangtse River
has proved sufficient of a barrier to keep the one form to the south
and the other to the north, and this in spite of the fact that hares
are well known to be expert swimmers.

The pikas (Ochotona) are really small hares or rabbits, and they
are confined to the north and the higher regions of the center and
west. Strangely enough they occur on the flat plains of Mongolia,
in the lowest ravines of Shensi and Kansu, in the forested areas
of Shansi, and also at the very summits of the highest mountain
ranges. This is evidently because they belong to a very old group
of mammals, and so have had a long period in the country in which
to spread and adapt themselves to all kinds of environment. They
once inhabited Europe, but became extinct there along with all the
other “steppe” animals. Now they are confined to certain parts
of Asia and North America.

The bats and insectivores are two other groups of mammals that
are well represented in China, some very remarkable forms of the
latter occurring in the west. In the north hedgehogs and shrews
are fairly common, as also are certain forms of mole. One of the
most interesting of the Chinese insectivores is the peculiar Veote-
tracus sinensis from the west, which combines the characters of the
shrews and the hedgehogs. +

Of apes and monkeys China does not boast a large number or
variety, though it is interesting to note that the most northerly repre-
sentatives of this great group of mammals in the world to-day are
to be met with in this country. Im the area to the northeast of
Peking, known as the Tung Ling, the fine Chihli macaque still
occurs. In Ssuchuan the famous golden-haired monkey (/hini-

—— oe
NATURAL HISTORY OF CHINA—SOWERBY 361

pithecus roxellanae), one of the only two known monkeys that
possess a nasal appendage, is found. This is a very large animal
with a long tail and sometimes a long mane of golden hair down
the back. In the southwest of Yunnan, on the Burmese border, sev-
eral species of ape and monkey occur, while in the south and south-
east others are to be met with.

While discussing the mammals mention should be made of the
remarkable scaled ant eater (Jfanis), also called the pangolin. This
creature is highly valued for its supposed medicinal properties. In
fact, in certain parts of China every wild animal that is at all un-
common is credited with medicinal properties, and fetches good
prices in the market. Thus the blood of the serow is considered
very valuable, as also are the blood, bones, and claws of a tiger, the
horns of the serow and goral, and the antlers of the stag. The
pangolin is confined to the south and southeast.

In the matter of marine mammals, the seas that wash the shores
of China are not very rich. Sea lions and common seals occur round
the coast, while various kinds of whales and dolphins are to be met
with further from land. Some extremely interesting river dolphins
occur in the waters of the Yangtse basin. Some of these have not
yet been identified. Certain lake forms suggest that at one time this
part of China was under the sea, the dolphins being left behind in
lakes when elevation of the land took place.

BIRDS

The birds of China are better known than any other branch of her
fauna, apparently for the reason that they have attracted more at-
tention from competent naturalists. It is probable that birds, in-
sects, especially butterflies, and shell-bearing mollusks the world
over have received more attention than other animals for the reason
that they are more attractive. Whatever the cause, the fact remains
that there is little to be expected in the way of new species of birds
to be discovered in this country, though a great deal of work still
remains for the ornithologist to do. For instance, the problems of
migration in this country have scarcely been studied as yet, while the
exact ranges of the indigenous forms of bird that occur have yet to
be determined. No country in the world offers a better field for re-
search to the ornithologist than does China. This country is the
headquarters of the great pheasant family, while its great variety
of topography offers the opportunity of studying its avi-fauna under
all kinds of conditions from open desert to dense forest, high moun-
tain ranges to swamps and flat lands. Breeding operations may be
watched, nesting haunts and conditions noted. Bird life is so abun-
dant that the student of nature need never be at a loss, unless it be
through an embarras de richesse,

I have heard it stated that there are some 1,200 descriptions of
birds from China. Whether this be the case or not, it is probably not
very wide of the mark to set the number of distinct forms known to
occur in the country at well over 600. In a list of birds that are
known to occur in Manchuria and the neighboring region, which I
have prepared with the help of various experts, there are some 500
forms. Most of these occur at least in some part of China proper,
and it is certain that the indigenous birds of the more westerly re-
gions must number considerably over 100 more.

The avi-fauna of China may be characterized as typically Palearce-
tic with a strong intrusion of Oriental species in the southern parts
of the country. At the same time the palearctic element may be
further described as being Tartarian in its affinities in the north and
northwest, and Himalayan in the highlarids of the west and central
areas. The importance of this Himalayan intrusion should not be
overlooked, for it will often explain the remarkable occurrence of
some species in an unexpected area. Botanists tell us that in the
higher parts of this country the flora is often distinctly Himalayan,
and this is to be explained by the fact that the Tsing Ling and other
high mountain ranges of central and west China.are apparently off-
shoots of the great Himalayan massif. We thus find that faunistic
areas or zones occur in a perpendicular direction as well as a horizon-
tal one, a fact first pointed out, I think it was, by Elwes, an orni-
thologist of considerable repute in England.

As regards migrant species in China, it may be pointed out that
the country receives infiuxes of birds from India as well as the
islands of the Indian-Pacific Oceans. Species that winter in the
Philippines, for instance, are commonly found breeding in the
mountains of north China. The whole of the China coast during
the migration season forms an immense highway for transient
visitors, which are on their way to Siberia to breed, and it is due to
this fact that we know as much as we do about the number and kinds
of birds that pass through China. It has been possible for observers
who have been employed either in some European firm at the coast
or in the customs service to devote their spare time to this fascinat-
ing subject, usually with very valuable results.

It is impossible here to go into details concerning the various
families, genera, and species of birds to be met with in the country.
The subject is too vast. Besides it would be superfluous, for there
are numerous excellent lists of such birds extant, not to mention
expansive works such as Gould’s “ Birds of Asia.” The museum of
this society contains a very fine collection of Chinese birds, and any-
one wishing to take up the subject will find that the specimens have
all been identified and labeled.
NATURAL HISTORY OF CHINA—SOWERBY 868

It has already been stated that China is the headquarters of the
pheasant family, and if any one point more than another character-
izes the avi-fauna of the country it is this. Perhaps another char-
acteristic that may be mentioned here is the number and variety of
the timaline birds—babblers, laughing thrushes, and the lke—that
occur. In the southern provinces we have such remarkable birds as
the crow-pheasant, crow tits, and trogons, nor should we neglect to
mention the numerous and beautiful flycatchers that inhabit this part
of the earth.

The birds of northeast China, Corea, and Manchuria are remark-
ably similar to those of Europe and the British Isles, and a study of
the subject reveals the fact that closely related forms, each grading
into the next, occur all the way from western Europe through Siberia
to these easterly regions.

REPTILES

In dealing with the reptiles and amphibians, or batrachians, of the
country we are confronted with a rather remarkable fact. North of
the Yangtse Valley these forms of animal life are very poorly repre-
sented, if not in numbers of individuals at least in variety of species,
while south of it there is a great abundance of both. The explanation
is not far to seek, and it lies in the climatic conditions to be encount-
ered in the two areas. These cold-blooded vertebrates are a weak rem-
nant of the great reptiles that lived in the days when the earth was
much warmer than it is to-day, when the climate was far more humid
and vegetation infinitely more luxurious and prevalent. Life for these
great saurians was comparatively easy, and so they did not evolve
any means of protecting themselves against the less favorable con-
ditions that followed the Carboniferous and Cretaceous periods of
the earth’s history. Their descendants survived, but, with the excep-
tion of the crocodiles and alligators, only as very small replicas of
the great monsters that once swarmed. And these survivors can no
more withstand severe climatic conditions than could their ancestors.
Only a comparatively few reptiles have been able to adapt themselves
to a desert environment, and, even so, usually in warm countries.
The bitter cold of the north China winter is too much for them.
Similarly amphibians originated in the dense tropical jungles,
swamps, and forests of the Carboniferous age, where their particular
mode of reproduction and development from an egg laid in the water
through an aquatic stage to a land animal was evolved. This they
have retained, but they, too, have become greatly reduced in size and
can only live where a congenial environment is to be found. Thus the
dryness of the north China climate is inimical to them. Central
China, on the other hand, offers much more favorable conditions to
both reptiles and amphibians, and so we have a corresponding increase
364 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

in the number and variety of the species that occur there. But it is
in south China that we find ideal conditions for the cold-blooded
land vertebrates, and here these animals swarm. The museum of this
society contains a very fine herpetological collection, thanks to the
energy and enthusiasm of Dr. Arthur Stanley, the recent curator.
But it is interesting to note that the greater part of the collection was
made in the Province of Fukien, where semitropical conditions pre-
vail, vegetation is extraordinarily thick, and plenty of permanent
streams occur. In a valuable paper by Doctor Stanley upon the
Chinese reptiles in the museum, some 72 species are listed, of which
49 have Fukien against their names. This does not mean, however,
that they are confined to that Province, for specimens of many of
them have been obtained elsewhere as well.

A glance at this list reveals the fact that of the various forms of
reptiles represented in this country, snakes predominate. Fifty-one
of the seventy-two species listed are snakes. These snakes range from
the monster python, a specimen of which from Fukien measures 20
feet, down to the tiny blind snake. The majority of the species are
nonpoisonous, but several very deadly forms occur. Amongst the
latter are the black cobra, recorded from Chekiang and Fukien, and
the terrible Chinese viper (Ancistrodon acutus), whose poison fangs
are enormous. Other poisonous snakes occuring in our region are
the sea snakes, which are only to be found in the sea, and have
become adapted to a marine pelagic existence by a lateral compres-
sion of the posterior part of the body and tail. The nonpoisonous
snakes are mostly what are called colubers—grass snakes and water
snakes—and are easily recognized by the usually slender bodies and
heads.

Lizards of various kinds are fairly common, amongst the com-
monest in the north being the spotted lizard (Hremias argus) and
the little gecko, the latter inhabiting the dwellings of man. In the
south occur the blue-tailed skink (Hwmeces chinensis) and its near
relative, the elegant skink (Z. eleyans). Another fairly common
form is the long-tailed lizard (Tachydromus septentrionalis) .

Of the turtle family China contains several forms, including the
mud turtle, some terrapins, and tortoises. Marine turtles are to be
taken at times in the China seas, or are washed ashore occasionally
on the southern coasts.

There is no need to do more than mention the little Yangtse alli-
gator here, as we have already referred to it. The only other mem-
ber of this family, the Crocodilide, which occurs in China, is the
estuarine crocodile, which is to be found in the rivers of the extreme
south. Its scientific name is Crocodilus porosus. The difference
between the alligators and the crocodiles, externally, is twofold.
NATURAL HISTORY OF CHINA—SOWERBY 865

The alligator has a much broader snout than the crocodile, while its
fourth tooth from the front in the lower jaw fits into a pit in the
upper jaw; that of the crocodile into a notch.

The amphibians in China are represented by numerous species of
frogs and toads, or tailless batrachians, as they are usually called,
as well as by a few newts and salamanders. ‘The tailless batrachians
greatly predominate, however. Remarkable forms are the little fire-
bellied toads (Bombina), the little tree toads (Hyla), and the
great tree frog (Rhacophorus), which is as large as a good-sized
toad and has its long toes webbed and knobbed at the tips,
thus enabling it to climb with agility. In the hills and mountains
of Fukien and Chekiang a huge frog, not unlike a bullfrog, occurs
amongst the damp rocks at the very summits of the ridges aad peaks.
Everywhere the edible frog, the smaller brown frogs, and the Asiatic
common toad are to be found. In the north Radde’s toad, a beauti-
fully marked species, is very common.

The commonest of the Urodela, or amphibians with tails, is the
Chinese newt (Diemictylus orientalis). A very handsome spotted
salamander also occurs,

Mention should be made of the remarkable giant salamander
(Megalobatrachus davidi), which, with the Japanese form, J.
japonicus, is the largest of the present day amphibians. This crea-
ture has been recorded from central China, a closely related form
occuring in the east. Both are very rare, at least in collections. The
Japanese form is more common, live specimens being frequently ex-
hibited in collections in Kurope and America.

FISHES

The subject of the fish, marine and fresh-water, of China is one of
extreme interest and importance. Its importance lies in the fact that
the Chinese depend so largely upon fish to supply them with the
necessary animal matter in their food. Of course the Chinese are
not unique in this, but owing to the numerous fine waterways and
large lakes that the country contains and her immense seaboard,
with a resultant magnificent supply of fish food at hand, they have
become fish eaters, in places to the exclusion almost of any other kind
of animal food. Thus the fishing industry of the country is of great
unportance, which in turn means that a thorough knowledge of her
finny inhabitants is vital to the future welfare of her people. As a
matter of fact the fishes of China are rather well known, though it
is obvious that there are many new discoveries to be made in this
branch of the country’s zoology.

The marine fish of China, that is to say, those occurring in the
China seas, are closely related to those of Japan, which means that
they are well known, for the Japanese and American scientists have
366 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

made a very thorough study of this subject. Many of the forms that
are taken in China seas are of very wide distribution, others very
local. The Clupeide, or herring family, is represented by a number
of species, but it is not a very important group. The same may be
said of the Gadide, or cod family, and the Pleuronectide, or flat
fishes, families that are very important in the European and North
American fisheries. The Perciforms, fishes that conform to the gen-
eral characteristics of the perches, such as basses, maigres, rockfishes,
sea breams, and the like, are of the utmost importance. One fish
that should be specially mentioned is the hairtail (7'richiwrus), the
long, silvery, ribbonlike fish that one sees so frequently for sale,
either in the dried form or fresh, in China. It is taken some little
distance out at sea, apparently in large numbers, and is a great
favorite with the Chinese. As one works northward along the east
coast of Corea toward that of the Primorsk and the Okhotsk Sea
the marine fish fauna undergoes a profound change in its composi-
tion. Flat fishes, herrings, gadoids, or cods and their relations, be-
come the important elements, while there is a remarkable increase
of members of such groups as the liparids, blennies, cottoids, and
agonids. At the same time we find the Pacific salmonoids appear-
ing, and running up the rivers to spawn, in exactly the same way as
they do on the coasts of Alaska, British Columbia, and the north
Pacific Coast States of America. In other words, the marine fishes
of the Manchurian region show strong affinities with those of North
America.

The fresh-water fishes of China are in many ways unique, or, per-
haps it would be better to say, China possesses a somewhat unique
fresh-water fish fauna. It is overwhelmingly cyprinid in its com-
position, the carp family having reached a high stage of develop-
ment in these parts. It is impossible to give a list of the peculiar
cyprinids that occur in Chinese waters, but a few forms may be
mentioned. The gigantic H'lopichthys bambusa, which resembles in
its external characteristics a salmon, and reaches a length of 4 or 5
feet, and a weight of over 100 catties, is one. The peculiar Hypoph-
thalmichthys molitrix, whose generic name means the fish with the
eyes on the under side, is another. This species also attains a great
size. China also possesses some very remarkable gudgeons, one of
which is very long and slender in the body, and has a long snout,
which gives it the appearance of a sturgeon. Breams, chubs, carps,
culters, bitterlings, minnows, and loaches are all represented, many
of them by genera purely Chinese. It is maintained that China was
one of the centers of development and dispersal of the ciprinids, or
carp family, and from a survey of its fish one might well believe this
to be true.
NATURAL HISTORY OF CHINA—SOWERBY 367

Next to the carps come the catfishes, or Siluride. Here again
China contains a great variety of species, though, taken as a whole,
they have nothing like the economic value of the carps.

Other groups of importance are the so-called Chinese perches,
which are in reality basses, certain cottoids, or bullheads, and the
serpent heads.

Of isolated species the little Polyacanthus opercularis, from
which the Chinese have bred the paradise fish, and the peculiar
ganoid Psephurus gladius, which inhabits the Yangtse and the Yel-
low River, and whose only other near relation is confined to the
Mississippi, are worthy of mention. The distribution of the latter
species and its near relation is interesting, as it is exactly that of the
alligators, of which we noted that one form occurs in the Yangtse
and the other in the Mississippi basin. It may further be noted that
the ganoids, like the alligators, belong to a very ancient type.

In connection with the fishes of China I should like to point out
to the members of the Royal Asiatic Society that the museum con-
tains practically no specimens of these forms of cold-blooded ver-
tebrates, and though the present acting curator, Dr. Noel Davis, and
I are trying to remedy this defect, it would be a splendid as if
some one would undertake to look after this branch, for of all the
things the Shanghai Museum ought to have, a good collection of fish,
bail. marine and fresh-water, is one of the most important. In this
branch, if in no other, lies a fine field of research, for it has an
economic as well as a scientific importance that none can deny.

INVERTEBRATES

We may now consider for a brief space the invertebrates of China.
Had my line of research in China been more in the direction of the
invertebrates, this lecture would have been devoted almost entirely
to them, for, important as the vertebrates are, they pale into insig-
nificance when compared with the lower forms of life. Yet, sad to
relate, the latter have been very much neglected. Zoologists have
almost invariably gone after the higher types of animal life, treating
the lower forms more or less as unimportant side lines. This is a
great pity, for the country is particularly rich in its invertebrate
fauna, and would well repay work done in this direction. It is true
that one or two branches of invertebrates have been well worked,
notably in the case of the lepidopterous insects and seashells. Other
branches of insect life, however, have been badly neglected, while
almost nothing, or, at least, very little, is known about the terrestrial
mollusks. What little is known shows that the land snails of China
are of vital importance in the matter of determining how the fauna
of these parts acquired its present distribution. Here, then, is
another field of research open to some enthusiast.
368 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

One other very interesting branch of zoological study that the
country offers is that of the marine and littoral invertebrate fauna.
This is a branch that many of the members of this society, and of
the whole Shanghai community, for that matter, might take up
without undue expense or exertion, for most people spend some of
their holidays at the seaside, where marine forms of life are thrust
upon one’s notice. The museum has some good material in this line,
but what is wanted is some one to take up this branch and go into
it thoroughly, and I can promise that person that he or she will be
amply rewarded. Museums at home are crying for such material,
and it would be a very easy matter to work in cooperation with ex-
perts in America and Europe, and so hasten the day when we can
say that the natural history of China is an open book for all who
will to study and enjoy. May that day soon come, and may the
north China branch of the Royal Asiatic Society, as practically the
only scientific society in the country, do its part.

LIFE IN THE OCEAN!
By Austin H. CLharkK

PREFACE

A comparison of the animals living in the sea with those inhabit-
ing the land brings out at once a most extraordinary paradox.

About three-fourths of all known kinds of animals live on the
land; but this formidable array represents only a few of the major
types. The most numerous land creatures are the insects, of about
half a million sorts. Equal in importance, much larger, but much
fewer both in kinds and numbers, are the vertebrates. Next in sig-
nificance are the nematodes. Of much less importance are the mol-
lusks—snails and slugs—and the annelids—earthworms, land leeches,
and onychophores. The representatives of the other major types
found on the land, planarians and nemerteans, are not of much im-
portance in the picture as a whole.

While in the sea there live less than one-fourth of all the animals
that so far have been described, these are widely distributed among
about three times as many major types as are those inhabiting the
land.

Certain marine types, like sponges, celenterates,and polyzoans,
and some groups of annelids, are sparsely represented in fresh water,
which also has some types, like gastrotrichas and the rotifers, quite
or almost wholly restricted to it. But of the major animal types no
less than 10 (priapulids, sipunculids, phoronids, brachiopods, che-
tognaths, echinoderms, enteropneusts, tunicates, and cephalochor-
dates), nearly half again as many as all land-living types together,
are exclusively marine.

On land different localities and situations are extremely variable
as regards the physical conditions. We find hot, temperate, and
cold, and uniform and changing, regions; dry, damp, and wet areas,
permanent or changeable. All these features, together with the
chemical variability of the soil, are reflected in the flora of the land,
and all these features plus the superadded features of the flora, affect

and Land, D. Van Nostrand Co., New York, 1924.
369
370 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

the animals. In consequence land animals have become subdivided
into an indefinite number of different forms or minor types each
most efficient within a small range of conditions.

But all land animals have one thing in common; they must seek
‘their food; it will not come to them. Therefore land animals are
almost wholly of those types, arthropods and vertebrates, best fitted
for locomotion, with representatives of some other types of fair loco-
motor powers.

In the sea conditions are quite different. The temperature range
is small. At no place temperatures of less than 28.4° are found,
while high temperatures, even in the Tropics, are confined to a thin
superficial layer. The great bulk of sea water ranges in temperature
between 35° and 60°. The chemical conditions are only slightly
variable. The salinity varies somewhat, but the different salts are
everywhere present in about the same proportion. Motion affects
only the surface waters, and is negligible except along the shores.

In the sea, food substances float everywhere suspended in the
water, drifting back and forth and up and down; abundant food lies
also on the bottom. ‘While useful, powers of locomotion are not
necessary for the creatures in the sea; if they can not seek their
food it will be brought to them.

Thus in the sea the food relations of the animals are of three
kinds; some go after it, as do the animals on land; some attach them-
selves or burrow in the bottom and let the water do the work of
bringing food to them; and some float suspended in their food
supply.

Three possible ways of obtaining food instead of one mean a cor-
responding diversity in the fundamental structure of the animals
involved; but the relative uniformity of the physical and chemical
conditions in the sea permit the existence of these major types with
relatively slight subdivision.

THE BASIS OF LIFE IN THE SEA

What is the biological significance of a large whale? The im-
mediate answer is that the largest whale, the blue or sulphur-bottom,
is the largest animal known, living or extinct, reaching a length of
90 feet. The weight of such a monster has not been determined;
but a torpedo boat of the same Jength with approximately the same
underwater contour would displace 32 tons. If we assume a weight
of 30 tons for the largest whale we shall not be far out of the way.

All whales are carnivorous; but all the fishes, cuttle-fish and
smaller creatures upon which they feed, are dependent ultimately
upon plant life for their existence. How much vegetable material
does it take to support a whale?
*

LIFE IN THE OCEAN—CLARK 371

If the 30 tons represented by a very large whale were incorporated
in the bodies of cattle, these cattle would require for their support
each day the amount of fats and carbohydrates present in the hay
yielded by an acre of good meadow land in a whole season’s growth.
A whale requires much less food than its equivalent in cows, since
it is entirely supported by the water and is much less active. On
the other hand, consuming only other animals, many of which them-
selves are two or three or more steps removed from a vegetable diet,
there is a very large wastage in the nutritive matter in the sea plants
before it enters the whale. We shall assume that the latter offsets the
former.

The State of Rhode Island has an area of 1,250 square miles. If
this State were wholly planted in grass and yielded as much hay
per acre as the average meadow, enough food would be produced in
the course of a summer to support a maximum of about 2,150 of
these great whales for a year; the District of Columbia could support
less than 125.

Yet whales are abundant in certain regions. I have myself seen
on the Pacific more than 100 at one time, though these were of a
kind much smaller than the blue whale. At the height of the whale
fishery at Spitzbergen the catch averaged slightly over 1,000 whales
a year, all large ones. The food of those that were killed, not con-
sidering those left alive, would represent the annual grass crop from
an area eight times the size of the District of Columbia.

These rough calculations are sufficient to show that the pastures
of the sea must be very rich, for not only do the marine pastures sup-
port numerous whales of all sizes, but in addition various large
sharks, a number over 40 and one over 50, and said to reach 70, feet
in length, and other huge fishes which are not eaten by whales and
therefore compete with them for the food supply. And then there
are the seals and the sea birds and hosts of bottom-living animals
in many places forming living carpets for miles and miles, all
browsing, so to speak, directly, or mostly indirectly, on the same
pastures.

It has been said that the marine pastures are richer than the
pastures of the land, and on occasion this certainly seems true; but
close comparison between the two is difficult. In the first place
sea animals require much less nutriment than those on land so that
comparison bulk for bulk between the two means little. Further-
more many whales and many of the larger fishes, like the mackerel
and the herring, are migratory creatures, wandering regularly, or
more or less irregularly, from place to place. On land the growth
of vegetation with us ceases in the winter, and in the Tropics is
much reduced in the dry season; nowhere is it uniform throughout
372 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

the year. In the sea the growth of vegetation also varies at different
times or seasons quite as much as on the land.

On land all vegetation grows on the ground, or on some support °
fixed to the ground, and all animals live on or in the ground or
among the plants growing upon it. Such animals as traverse the
air do so only as a means of getting from place to place or, a very
few, to feed upon others so engaged. The air, for all practical pur-
poses, is a sterile medium. Potentially, however, conditions are
quite otherwise.

In the city of Caracas, I was always greatly interested by the
sight of festoons of plants, especially “wild pineapples” or
bromelias, growing on the electric-light cables high in air and
nourished only by substances extracted from the air. What does
this signify? It proclaims the fact that wherever a plant can find
support it can grow in the air just as well as on the ground, and
suggests that if plants could only hover in the air like humming
birds the atmosphere in the warmer regions would soon be converted
into a dense jungle. Such a calamity is averted by the great weight
of plant tissues as compared to air, which forces all plants to grow
attached directly or indirectly to the ground.

Now water is 814 times as heavy as air, almost as heavy as
protoplasm, the living substance of which both animals and plants
are composed. Only the very slightest modifications are necessary
to enable plants and animals to float about suspended at any depth
in sea water, like the particles of mud in a muddy river.

The only plants we see in the ocean are along the shores attached
to the rocks, like the devil’s aprons or laminarias, the rockweeds,
the sea lettuces, etc., or rooted in the mud like the eelgrass. The
gulfweed or sargassum, so frequently seen floating in large patches.
on the north Atlantic, is in reality a rockweed from the Caribbean
region growing feebly but never fruiting, and finally dying and
going to the bottom, exactly as so many willow twigs would do float-
ing on the surface of a lake.

Quite a number of creatures browse upon these plants along the
shores, the largest of these being the manatees when in the sea, the
sea cows and the dugongs. But it is obvious that the narrow fringe
of seaweeds along the coasts can not supply the food of all the
creatures upon which the whales subsist, much less the basic food
of the myriads and myriads of other creatures with which the
open ocean is populated. It is true that some of the brown seaweeds
are very abundant, like the kelps on our New England and our
western coasts, and some are of very considerable size, reaching 300,
400, or even 700 feet in length; but their actual mass when con-
sidered in relation to the food requirements of the sea animals is
almost infinitesimal,
LIFE IN THE OCEAN—CLARK 373

On pools and ponds and in quiet backwaters from lakes and rivers
in the summer time the water is often quite hidden from view by the
little floating plants called duckweeds or lemnas. Why do we never
find floating seaweeds living in the same way? On a pond or lake,
if the duckweeds are blown about by the winds, it does not much
matter where they go; the conditions are about the same everywhere
and some at least will eventually be washed into a backwater like
the one from which they came. In the sea a floating plant, if not
washed up on some beach, would sooner or later be carried to a
region with a different temperature or with different chemical con-
ditions where it would eventually die, just as the sargassum does.
Large free-floating plants, requiring a large amount of nutritive
matter and of sunlight and a more or less constant temperature, at
least for considerable periods each year, such as are often so abund-
ant in fresh waters, can not exist in the sea because of the certainty
of eventual destruction through the impossibility of remaining
continually within the narrow range of conditions under which alone
their existence can be maintained. :

But suppose the bulk of a 400-foot seaweed were distributed
among several billions of microscopic plants. These would soon
separate in all directions; some would sink to all depths below the
surface, and those at the surface would be widely scattered by the
winds and waves. Millions might be swept away and lost, but other
millions would always be present constantly bringing forth millions
of young. If small enough and distributed from the surface of the
sea down to the limit of effective light penetration, about 650 feet
as a maximum, and capable of rapid reproduction, such plants would
be unloseable, so to speak, and always permanently present in any
given locality.

This is exactly what occurs in the ocean. The great bulk of ma-
rine vegetation we can not see. It is composed mainly of plants
called diatoms, especially prolific in cold regions and at cold seasons,
of peridineans in the Tropics and at warm seasons, of the exceed-
ingly small coccolithophorids, the very minute flagellates, and of
other types.

The numbers of these little plants can only be imagined, not really
appreciated. It has been calculated that in the water of Kiel Bay
there are 6,336,000 diatoms alone per quart—or were at the time the
calculation was made. If there are 6,336,000 diatoms in a quart of
water, how many would there be in an area of the ocean the size of
the State of Rhode Island, that is, 1,250 square miles, down to a
depth of 650 feet, the depth to which at least they may be assumed
to live? |

1454—25——_25
374 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Of course many regions are much poorer in diatoms than Kiel
Bay, while many are richer; in the Arctic and in the Antarctic they
may be so abundant at times as to color the water for miles and to
give it a slight, but noticeable, “ smooth ” feeling.

The preceding paragraphs would seem to imply a static condition
in the oceanic flora, which is quite the reverse of the real condition.
The calculation given for Kiel Bay is for a single season only. In
a given spot at times the sea may swarm with microscopic plants,
while at other times it may be practically barren. In some places
the difference in productivity at different seasons is almost as great
as the difference in the productivity of your garden between mid-
summer and midwinter. Usually the difference at different times
is less than this, but the amount of plant life present in any given
region of the sea is always very variable.

What are the diatoms? The diatoms are very minute plants which
occur wherever there is moisture and light, in fresh, brackish, and
salt water, on the moist surfaces of rocks, etc. The fresh-water
forms all differ from those in the sea or in brackish water. Many
kinds live attached, but many others float about suspended in the
water, often in incredible numbers. The attached forms usually
form a brownish stratum or a furry covering over plants and other
objects in the water. In the Arctic the beginning of spring is fore-
shadowed by the brownish discoloration of the under surface of the
ice due to a scum of bottom-living diatoms which have risen up and
become attached to it.

The body of the diatom is inclosed within two lids or valves which
fit together somewhat like the bottom and cover of a pill box.
These are fashioned of silica, and are of the most exquisite beauty,
often highly ornamented, and of various shapes, oval, crescentic,
S shaped, linear, or wedge shaped, though most of them are navi-
culoid or canoe shaped. Most of the important pelagic diatoms form
chains. Of a medium-sized species it would take 200 individuals
in a row to make an inch; while a few are larger than this, many
are much smaller.

Diatoms reproduce mainly by simple division into two, each of
which in its turn divides into two, making four, and so on. The
capabilities of this process may be appreciated when it is realized
that if one diatom should divide into two in 24 hours, and its
progeny do the same, in the course of a single month 1,000,000,000
would be produced.

So far as I am aware, the rapidity of multiplication of the marine
diatoms under optimum conditions has never been satisfactorily
determined. But it has been calculated that a single diatom may
give rise to 1,000,000,000 in a month. With 6,000,000 diatoms, more
or less, to a quart of water in such a locality as Kiel Bay, each one
LIFE IN THE OCEAN—CLARK 375

with a reproductive capacity of roughly 1,000,000,000 per month,
all of the diatoms could be destroyed except for a single one to each
166 quarts of water, yet in a month the full number would be again
restored. This shows clearly the immense advantage the minute
diatoms have over larger plants as floating organisms in the sea,
and why it is that the marine vegetation, except along the shores,
is all microscopic, and not only microscopic but extremely small.

The peridineans, coccolithophorids, flagellates, etc., while very
different from the diatoms in bodily form and structure, are more or
less similar to them in their relations to the marine world, so that it
will not be necessary to consider them in detail.

While these little plants are able to increase at a most amazing
speed and at times occur in incredible abundance, this only takes
place under a small range of conditions, occurring for the most part
at certain limited seasons. On land in many regions when the
drought is broken by the rains, grasses and many other plants im-
mediately appear in great abundance. Each grass blade is the equiv-
alent in dry nutritive material of many million diatoms, and the
synthesis or formation of nutritive material under these conditions
is probably at least as rapid as it ever is at sea.

We live on land and are accustomed to strike an annual average
of the conditions on our farms. The study of the sea is in its in-
fancy, and we know it mostly from investigations in the spring
and summer months. Until we know our seas throughout the year
in detail we can not compare its potential productivity with that
of our land areas.

THE INTERMEDIATE FOODS OF THE SEA

These floating, very small, sea plants occur in all] localities, but
they are naturally much more abundant in some places than in
others. They are subject to great seasonal fluctuations in their num-
bers, and they become less common, many of them entirely disap-
pearing, toward midocean.

They are so very small that, although their presence may con-
vert the sea water into a thin living-vegetable soup, special adapta-
tions are necessary to enable animals to feed upon them.

These adaptations are along three main lines.

Many animals of a structure very similar to that of these plants,
some almost as small but others larger, live among them, entangling
them in networks of slender sticky threads projected from their
bodies. Such are the oceanic foraminifera and the radiolarians.
Some of the peridineans, too, are incapable of synthesizing inor-
ganic into organic substances, and therefore live upon the other
little floating plants in the same way that rusts and blights live
upon the leaves of plants on land. °
376 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Some animal types have given rise to very small forms which are
able to pick out the little clusters of minute plants from the sea
water. It is rather curious that the two animal groups to which,
outside of the vertebrates, all the giants of the sea belong, the crus-
taceans and the mollusks, should have been the ones to produce the
vast bulk of small creatures which feed upon the little plants.

Most numerous in kinds and numbers are the very small crus-
taceans of many different sorts which at certain places and at certain
seasons occur in myriads and are present in greater or lesser abun-
dance almost everywhere, and the very young stages of many of the
larger ones—crabs, ‘lobsters, shrimps, ete. Just as on land the
insects are the chief intermediates through whose services plant sub-
stance is made available for spiders, scorpions, predaceous insects,
and most vertebrates that are not plant feeders, so their close rela-
tives, the crustaceans, are the main factors in the conversion of the
microsopic plants in the ocean into a form in which their substance
can be used by other invertebrates and by fish and whales.

Of these little crustaceans, the copepods are the most important,
occurring in very great variety and in enormous numbers. Some-
times they are so very abundant as to give a pinkish or a red color
to the sea for many miles, when they become important as a food
for certain whalebone whales. The euphausians also, small deli-
cate shrimplike creatures showing little variety, also feed on these
small plants, and may be as abundant in bulk, though not in numbers,
as the copepods. One of these, which in the springtime swarms in the
fjords of northwestern Europe, then forms the exclusive food of the
giant Blue whale in that region. The common rorqual, closely re-
lated to this monster and reaching a length of 70 feet, feeds partly on
fish and is frequently seen feasting among shoals of herring which
themselves are feeding upon the copepods and other small crusta-
ceans which consume the plants.

Before leaving the copepods it should be mentioned that of all
sea creatures they have shown themselves the most versatile in mak-
ing use of reserves of food material. Besides the free-swimming
ones, and the more numerous kinds of bottom-living ones, there are
many that live in the food-collecting apparatus of the sea squirts,
stealing the food gathered by them, in the digestive canal of crinoids,
and in similar situations, while others become parasitic and often
very large, and as “fish lice” prey upon the very creatures which,
directly or indirectly, are feeding upon their plant-eating relatives,
just as the bird bot flies live on the blood of insect-eating birds.
One of these, in fresh water, lives upon the gums of the crocodile,
which is relieved of its unwelcome presence through the attentions
of the crocodile bird.

“LIFE IN THE OCEAN—CLARK 3877

Besides the very small crustaceans, the chief plant eaters of the
open ocean are curious and delicate little mollusks, the “sea butter-
flies,” or pteropods, and their allies. But while some forms of these
eat plants, most of them live upon minute plant-eating animals,
mostly small crustaceans and other mollusks. There are, as com-
pared with the crustaceans, relatively few kinds; but some of them
occur in incredible numbers, and in the seas about Greenland and in
other places they form an important part of the food of the whale-
bone whales. So abundant are some of the shell-bearing species that
“ in various parts of the Gulf of Mexico, the Mediterranean, the Bay
of Biscay, and elsewhere the sea bottom is more or less exclusively
composed of their dead remains, just as in other places it is almost
entirely composed of the shells of the foraminifera or the frustules
of diatoms.

The third method of devouring the minute oceanic plants is by
filtering them from the water and thus concentrating them. The
only oceanic animals that have recourse to this process are the salps
and the appendicularians, queer creatures allied to the sea squirts,
and certain of the smaller fishes, like the menhaden. Their strain-
ing apparatus is most wonderfully efficient, and it is surprising to
learn, from looking at the contents of their stomachs through a mi-
croscope, how small is the size of some of the organisms they capture.

THE ANIMAL LIFE OF THE OPEN SHA

In the bodies of the small crustaceans, the pteropods and allied
mollusks, the salps and their relatives, the foraminifera, and a few
other types, the nutritive matter represented by the microscopic
plants is reassembled into units of appreciable size. Upon these
units, for the most part upon the crustaceans which represent the
most abundant and most generally distributed of these units, feed
all the other creatures of the open ocean, directly or indirectly.

Consuming these directly are larger crustaceans and mollusks,
numerous fishes, the herring and herringlike fishes, flying fishes, the
young of all, or nearly all, other marine fishes, etc., the larger salps,
the jointed or annelidan worms, the nemerteans, the arrow worms or
cheetognaths, the whalebone whales, the smaller jellyfishes, the cteno-
phores, and the very few pelagic echinoderms.

Upon these larger animals, but especially upon the fishes, live
very large and formidable jellyfishes, many kinds of fishes ranging
in size up to the basking-, whale-, and other giant sharks, reaching a
length of from 40 to 70 feet, the smaller members of the whale tribe,
the porpoises, dolphins, etc., and the squids and cuttlefish, some of
which are very large, one reaching a length of 55 feet. The squids
and cuttles form almost the entire food of the great sperm whale,
the bottlenose, and the other toothed whales.
378 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

The fishes are the most omnivorous of all sea creatures, some kind
or other eating every sort of oceanic creature, and every other prod-
uct of the sea.

Jellyfishes are sometimes of enormous size, ranking with the larg-
est of sea animals. At Nahant, Mass., Prof. Louis Agassiz measured
one in which the bell was 714 feet across and the tentacles more than
120 feet in length; this was one of those reddish ones frequently seen
on the New England coast in the late summer.

On and above the surface of the sea, especially in the cooler regions
where life is most abundant, live great numbers of birds which are ©
truly oceanic and never visit land except to nest. These are mostly
of the tube-nosed tribe, albatrosses, shearwaters, petrels, diving pet-
rels, etc., and some at least are familiar to everyone who has ever
been anywhere at sea. Where ocean life is especially abundant there
are multitudes of auks, puffins, murres, etc., in the northern regions,
and of penguins in the southern. Some terns are almost pelagic in
habit, like the noddy and the black-backed, and I have seen tropic
birds hundreds of miles from land both in the Atlantic and in the
Pacific.

These birds feed chiefly upon small crustaceans, since these are
offered most abundantly. The albatrosses and similar large sea birds,
however, eat mostly squid which they catch at night, and the other
larger birds eat squid and fish when they can get them, especially
the terns and tropic birds. But nearly all these birds will eat any sea
animal of suitable size, or if divided or divisible into fragments of
suitable size, and the fioating carcass of a giant squid or whale affords
a feast for thousands of them.

The only oceanic insect is a little water strider, related to the water
striders of our ponds, which picks the small crustaceans from the
sea and sucks their juices. Though small and inconspicuous, they
are not rare, and I have collected many of them both in the China
Sea and in the Caribbean.

But as yet the story of pelagic life is only half complete. The
crustaceans for the most part are the intermediates through which
the organic material synthesized by the minute plants is made avail-
able for the use of the oceanic animals. Each of the larger oceanic
animals represents in itself an important reservoir of food for other
animals. Besides the predaceous types, there are many creatures,
especially crustaceans, that live within the stomachs of other animals,
eating the food they swallow, and within the filter of the salps con-
suming the minute organisms they are concentrating for themselves.
And in addition there are bizarre misshapen forms of very numerous
sorts which live within the bodies of practically all the larger crusta-
ceans, feasting on their jr''ces, with sometimes others living in the
LIFE IN THE OCEAN—CLARK 379

same way within them; while many, equally uncanny and deformed,
live like lice sucking the blood of fishes, and others bore deep into
the skin of whales.

Within the digestive tube of the fishes, whales, and sea birds live
certain creatures not found elsewhere, except that some have been
found to exist as larve within the bodies of crustaceans. These are
the tapeworms, echinorhynchs, etc., which have no stomachs but ab-
sorb through their skin the nutritive fluids in the alimentary canals
of their hosts.

In the middle of the day in the Tropics and in the height of the
summer in the temperate regions most animals seek the shade and
become more or less inactive; animal life is most in evidence early
in the morning and again toward evening. At sea most animals, es-
pecially in low latitudes and where the sea is clear, seek the shade
in just the same way, retreating far below the surface to the twilight
zone in the daytime, reappearing at or soon after dark.

Midway between Bermuda and St. Kitts I have watched the sea
for hour after hour without detecting a single living thing. But
on one trip we stopped to pick up a buoy that had broken away
from its moorings off New Orleans some years previously. Scarcely
had the speed begun to slacken before all sorts of creatures began
to appear in the shadow of the ship. A small light speck deep down
slowly increased in size and was finally revealed as a 15-foot shark,
which insisted, in spite of all discouragement on the part of the
sailors, in accompanying the small boat sent out to attach a line to
the buoy. Other smaller sharks appeared, together with the inevit-
able pilot fish, and a troop of those magnificiently colored fish called
by sailors dolphins, though in no way like true dolphins, which are
small fish-eating whales. When the buoy was brought up to the
ship the underside was seen to be festooned with growths, about
which played many little fishes, and on being hoisted on board many
kinds of animals were found among the “ weeds.” Almost as soon
as the steamer got under way again everything vanished, and the
sea became as deserted as before. But about a score of small sharks
and as many pilot fish lay on the fore deck, evidence of the prowess
of some of the Chinese women in the steerage.

On the Pacific in low latitudes we found that we were most
successful in finding oceanic life in the daytime if we lowered our
tow-nets to about 600 feet beneath the surface. In this region there
is twilight even on the brightest day at noon, and it is at this or
somewhat lesser depths that the sea animals for the most part seek
refuge from the light.

The animals taken in a haul 600 feet or more below the surface
in the daytime and in another haul in the same place taken on the
3880 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

surface at 9 or 10 o’clock at night are fot quite alike. Most of
them are the same, but in the deeper haul there are to be found
various large shrimplike crustaceans, mostly bright red in color,
strange jellyfishes of a deep red, and different sorts of sooty black
fishes, some armed with enormous teeth and most ferocious in ap-
pearance, others long and eellike, with snipelike jaws, and others
looking more like ordinary fishes but with rows of brilliant phos-
phorescent lights along their sides; quite commonly there are also
little distorted silvery fishes, also with lights, and sometimes little
black sharks from 6 or 8 inches to a foot in length.

These creatures are representatives of the deep oceanic fauna
which remains below the illuminated upper layers of the sea, feed-
ing upon the surface animals when these descend in the daytime
to escape the sunlight, and upon the smaller animals about them.

The oceanic plants can only live to a maximum depth of about
650 feet, and at that depth only in the most transparent water;
but the animals which feed upon them form the food of other
animals which live deeper, in perpetual shade, and these again
furnish food for other, though fewer, animals which live still farther
down, in perpetual night. The oceanic animals, largest as well as
smallest at the surface, extend downward for an indefinite distance,
becoming less and less varied and gradually scarcer and more uni-
form in size; probably, indeed, no level of the sea is entirely with-
out them.

Well out of sight, but probably in the twilight zone where food
is most abundant and conditions are practically the same in all
the oceans except in the extreme north and south, live giant squids
and cuttles of several kinds, the largest, occasionally found floating
in a dying or dead condition in the autumn on the fishing banks
and sometimes in other parts of the sea, reaching a total length
of at least 55 feet, with the body 20 feet long and 12 feet in circum-
ference and the eye opening 7 by 9 inches; in one individual meas-
ured the tentacular arms were 37 feet in length. In October, 1875,
between 25 and 30 of these giant squid were found by the vessels
of the Gloucester fishing fleet on the Grand Banks and cut up and
used for bait. The schooner Howard, Capt. J. W. Collins, alone
secured 5 of these, which were mostly from 10 to 15 feet in length,
not including the arms. The schooner 7'’ragabigzanda, Captain Mal-
lory, secured 3 from 8 to 12 feet long in one afternoon. Probably
as many were found by the ships from other towns as by those
from Gloucester.

The famous sea serpent can from most accounts be identified as
one of these great squid in a dying condition, somewhat distorted
by an active imagination. The head with the frilled neck, so com-
monly described, is the tail of the squid lifted above the water.
' LIFE IN THE OCEAN—CLARK 381

The long slender snakelike sea serpents are the writhing arms of
which the expanded ends look something like a head. |

Another common sea serpent on the New England coast is a com-
posite picture of two basking-sharks which, swimming one behind
the other, sometimes appear as a single creature nearly 100 feet in
length. Still other sea serpents are based on porpoises or dolphins,
and on large tropical fishes.

Other inhabitants of the twilight zone are strange fishes, espe-
cially the ribbon fishes, which may reach a length of over 20 feet
with a height of a foot or less and a thickness of only an inch or
two at the broadest part. Ribbon fishes and their close relatives,
the oar fishes, are found floating dead or washed up on the beaches
in all parts of the world, and seem not to vary from one locality
to another. Very young ones, queer looking things, are sometimes
taken in tow-nets.

THE OCEAN AND THE LAND

On land there is vegetation everywhere except in the most arid
regions, and even there a heavy rain is immediately followed by the
appearance of plants of many kinds. The plants are always the
most conspicuous living features of every landscape; but they grow
only on the surface of the land, rooted in the soil or, more rarely,
attached to some support or floating in the water.

In the open sea no plants are ever visible, save for an occasional
dying rockweed torn from its moorings, though sometimes streaks
and clouds indicate masses of diatoms or other minute plants in-
dividually invisible to the unaided eye. The visible life of the sea
is entirely animal; but the microscopic plants, all of which drift
freely about, exist in incredible numbers and occupy a broad stratum
reaching a maximum of about 650 feet in thickness in the clearest
waters of the Tropic seas, but decreasing to a much lesser thickness
north and south where the water is less transparent and where the
light is less.

Very few animals feed directly upon the sea plants, and of these
only the minute crustaceans are of first importance. These, pos-
sessed of only feeble swimming powers, drift aimlessly about and
may be said to furnish the chief, though a purely secondary, basis
of marine life; though animals, they are to the ocean what the green
plants are to the land.

In contrast to land animals, most of the smaller and many of the
fairly large marine animals, such as the jellyfishes and the younger
stages of such fishes as the ribbon fishes and the eels, are more or less
transparent, some quite so, looking like glass models of themselves.

Never put your fingers into the catch of a tow-net haul without
first knowing what is there. Once I was trying to catch a paper

1454—25——26
382 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

nautilus without a shell, which was swimming about in a bowl of
water containing material from a haul off south Japan, when my
finger was violently seized by something. Exploration with a glass
rod and a pair of forceps revealed the presence of a large and ugly
amphipod an inch or so in length, entirely transparent, though as
tough as any other.

From the surface of the ocean down to great depths animals exist,
but the number of major groups and of species rapidly decreases
and their size becomes more nearly uniform below the limit of light,
until in the deeper layers only grotesque fishes, cuttle fishes, jelly-
fishes, crustaceans, nemerteans, and echinoderms, all feeding on each
other, are found.

THE SEA SHORES

The shores of the sea are bathed by the water from the open
ocean, charged with microscopic plants and small crustaceans, and
with such of the creatures feeding on these as are able to support
the light of day. But because of the fact that the rocks and stones
and mud, and to a lesser degree the sand, offer facilities for attach-
ment, conditions here are entirely different from what they are in
the open sea.

Along the shores an attached plant, as a result of the movement of
the water about it, has constantly delivered to it a fresh supply of
the dissolved substances necessary for its growth, and it is main-
tained permanently under conditions most suitable for its existence.
Hence the enormous development of the brown, green, and red alge,
or “seaweeds.” Some of the flowering plants, too, have become
adapted to marine conditions, and one of these, the eelgrass, belong-
ing to the pondweed family, forms extensive beds in suitable lo-
calities.

These plants are important in providing shade and hiding places
for the animals found among them, and when alive they are eaten
by a few mollusks, like the periwinkle, by a few crustaceans and
fish, mostly under stress of hunger, by some sea urchins and, where
these occur, by sea cows, manatees, and dugongs, by some turtles,
and by a single lizard. When they die their leaves or fronds break
up and the fragments form the vegetable detritus so very important
as the basic food of the marine animals along the shores.

In the open sea the animals can avoid the dangers attending too
violent wave action by simply descending to the quiet depths. Along
the shores there is no escape from the constant movement of the
water. This incessant turmoil on the shore line, however, is easily
translated from a menace into a distinct advantage; animals simply
attach themselves firmly to seaweeds, stones, or other objects, and
let the water do the work of bringing food to them.
LIFE IN THE OCEAN—CLARK 383

On land the most successful plants are the flowering plants, which
grow by forming a series of units one above the other called phytons,
by the multiplication of these units producing a rosette of leaves
or a tall or branching leafy stem and thus exposing the maximum
green surface to the sunlight and the air.

The sea water being charged with nutrient particles throughout,
it is obvious that in the shallow regions any animals which are able
to attach themselves and to produce in the same way as do the flower-
ing plants an indefinite series of reduplicated units each more or less
perfect in itself would be able to avail themselves to best advantage
of the food materials drifting here and there and all around about
them.

Attached animals, particularly animals that grow and look like
plants, are especially characteristic of the sea shores. The so-called
colonial animals along the coasts which, plantlike in their growth
though in no other way, live firmly fastened and secure their food
from the restless water as it washes back and forth, are the sponges,
certain cclenterates, including the hydroids, the corals, the sea
fans or gorgonians, the millepores, the sea pens or pennatulids, the
umbellularians, the alcyonarians, the antipatharians, the colonial
anemones, and some other types, the polyzoans, the phoronids, the
rhabdopleurids, the cephalodiscids, and the colonial tunicates or
sea squirts.

The sponges, all of which when alive possess a strong odor dis-
agreeable to us, though it may be attractive to the little things on
which they live, have the general mass (it can scarcely be called a
body) pierced by numberless small holes leading into small tubes
lined with extremely delicate hairlike structures, called cilia, beating
inward. These small tubes lead into larger ones, and these finally
into an opening leading to the exterior, through which a constant
stream of water, impelled by the ceaseless action of the cilia in the
small tubes, pours outward. On its journey through the canals of
the sponge this water has lost a considerable portion of the nutritive
particles which originally it contained. - One does not think of
muscular power in connection with the apparently motionless
sponges. Yet on the reefs at Bermuda at low tide I have frequently
seen the calm surface of the sea much agitated by a stream of water
coming from below which investigation showed originated from the
outlet of a large sponge.

This food-collecting system of the sponges is very efficient, and
other animals take advantage of it. Jointed worms of many kinds,
one a much-branched creature with a head on the end of every branch.
live within the canals, as do various small crustaceans and brittle
stars. Barnacles, embedded in the outer layers, and some crustaceans
384 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

with similar boring habits, as well as comatulids attached to the sur-
face, all take advantage of the indraft of water into the small canals.

The polyzoans, phoronids, rhabdopleurids, and cephalodiscids are
all provided with a tentacular apparatus, the tentacles being abun-
dantly supplied with cilia which pick the food particles from the
water and pass them downward along their inner side toward the
mouth. The polyzoans, common everywhere, are leaflike or encrust-
ing growths on seaweeds, etc.; the individual animals in the colonies
are minute, but very numerous, and are often divided into various
types, each suited to perform a special function: A few polyzoans
are solitary, or occur in small colonies. The representatives of the
other three groups mentioned above are mostly uncommon, local, or
inhabiting rather deep water. In the phoronids and cephalodiscids
the individual animals in the colony, though they all arise by bud-
ding from the same original individual and all live together in the
same mass of tubes, are not connected with each other as in the poly-
zoans and rhabdopleurids.

The colonial tunicates or sea squirts form thick incrustations on a
usually rocky base. They are provided with an exceedingly fine
sieve through which they draw the water, separating out from it
the food particles.

The colonial ccelenterates are very diverse in size and shape. The
most familiar are the corals, millepores, red corals, and sea fans or
gorgonians of the warmer seas, and on our coasts numerous kinds
of hydroids, forming mossy or feathery plumes on seaweeds or on
other objects. One of the last, dried, stained green, and placed in a
flower pot, is the common “Japanese air plant ” sometimes seen of-
fered for sale. Other sorts of ccelenterates are the sea pens and sea
feathers, dead men’s fingers and other alcyonarians, horny corals
or antipatharians, and the colonial anemones. All of the sea anem-
ones and jellyfishes belong to this group, and indeed many of tlie
smaller of the latter are nothing more than the sexual units which
have been liberated from hydroids.

The stony corals are important in assisting to a greater or lesser
extent in the formation of the immense coral reefs which are such a
conspicuous feature in many parts of the tropical seas. Some of
them grow to a huge size, though the living portion consists only of
a relatively thin superficial layer. The stony axis of the red coral
is familiar to all because of its use in jewelry. Some ceelenterates
reach a very large size, certain gorgonians attaining a height of 15
feet, some sea pens being 6 or 7 feet or more in length, and some
umbellularians more than 8 feet tall.

The colonial ccelenterates consist of a great number of sacklike
units which have about the opening a row of 6 or 8 or more ten-
tacles armed with formidable stinging organs, or of such units
LIFE IN THE OCEAN—CLARK 885

intermixed with other types modified from them, borne upon a flat-
tened, wandlike or treelike support. The units vary from very
small, in the hydroids and millepores, to an inch or so in diameter;
in the noncolonial forms they may be more than a foot across. The
stinging organs, which paralyze as well as sting the prey, enable the
celenterates to use as food much larger and stronger creatures than
do any other of the animals which feed in this way, and they are
wholly carnivorous.

The ccelenterates support many parasites, especially crustaceans,
which live within their bodies or travel up and down their stems
appropriating the food which they have collected, and brittle stars,
especially adapted for clinging to them, while many animals attach
themselves to them which are known to live nowhere else, yet which
do not feed upon them, like certain anemones. Many small fishes
and other creatures live among their branches, protected from their
enemies by their stinging tentacles, while a wealth of different types,
especially worms and mollusks, hide themselves away in the stony
bases of the large corals.

A group of colonial ccelenterates, the so-called siphonophores, in-
cluding the Portuguese man-of-war, one of the most formidable of
all the jellyfishes on account of its unusually developed stinging
powers, and a group of colonial tunicates, have adopted an oceanic
life, and all the species drift about as true elements of the oceanic
fauna.

Besides these colonial attached animals, there are many others
which live attached, but never form colonies, though many are highly
social.

The most familiar of these are, perhaps, the barnacles, some of
which, like acorn barnacles, live closely appressed to rocks, piles, the
carapaces of sea turtles, etc., while others, like the goose barnacles,
formerly supposed to be the young of the barnacle goose, are stalked
and are most frequently seen on floating bits of wood, on the bottoms
of ships, and about the mouths of whales.

The barnacles have several pairs of curved feathery appendages
with which they sweep small animals from the sea water. These
featherlike structures, together with the color, which resembles that
of a barnacle goose, taken in connection with the fact that this goose
was not known ever to lay eggs—its nests have only recently been dis-
covered in, for a goose, most unlikely places—gave rise to the idea of
the connection between the two. The barnacles are crustaceans re-
lated to the copepods. In their young stages they are quite like other
young crustaceans, but they undergo profound changes during
growth. Some barnacles, which live on whales, bore deep into their
skin to attain a better anchorage. Others bury themselves in the
outer layers of sponges. Many others, become parasitic, when
young bore into crabs and other large crustaceans and, losing all
386 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

semblance to others of their kind, develop a mass of roots through
which, plantlike, they absorb the juices of their host.

The seapeaches and other large sea squirts are familiar to all
fishermen on our coasts. They have a sieve inside of them by means
of which they strain small organisms from the water, after the man-
ner of the salps.

The brachiopods, which look like bivalve mollusks but are really
very different, mostly live attached, though a few burrow into mud.
Their food-collecting mechanism is in general similar to that of
the polyzoans and phoronids, to which they are supposed to be re-
lated. One of them, called the snake’s head, is very common in
suitable localities on the New England coast below the low-tide mark.

Some bivalve mollusks live attached to firm supports, like the
oysters of our shores, while many others, like the clams and razors,
live buried in the mud. Some, like the mussels, attach themselves
with slender silken threads, as all do when very young. The qua-
hogs or hard-shelled clams, from which the Indians used to make
their wampum, and other forms lie exposed in quiet places on the
bottom. A few, like the sea dates or pholids, bore into rock and
sometimes in great numbers into breakwaters, while the shipworms
or teredos, which are not worms at all but mollusks, tunnel into
wood and feed upon it, like the larve of boring insects in the for-
est trees. Most of the unattached bivalves can move about, though
rather slowly; a few are quite active, like the razor shells, and the
scallops are more active still, and can even swim.

Many worms, while not attached themselves, live in tubes of their
own construction attached to other objects or partly rooted in the
mud.

Of animals which live wholly exposed or hiding away in burrows,
holes, and crevices and among the roots of plants, there are multi-
tudes of conchs, whelks, drills, periwinkles, and other snaillike crea-
tures, of crustaceans of very many sorts, and jointed worms of many
different types, together with nemerteans, some of which are very
large, priapulids, sipunculids, and flatworms. Fishes, of course, are
every where.

Besides the abundance of attached animals, especially of the colo-
nial types, the coastal regions are mainly characterized by the great
development of three groups of animals which are almost or quite
unrepresented in the open sea. These are the bivalve, the gastropod
or snaillike mollusks, and the echinoderms, including the starfishes,
the brittlestars, the sea urchins, the sea cucumbers or holothurians,
and the crinoids. The first two are most abundant along the shore,
becoming much less common in deeper water, while the echinoderms
rapidly increase in relative abundance with increasing depth. Prac-
tically all the members of these three groups are sluggish animals,
most of them able only to crawl slowly, though a few bivalves and
LIFE IN THE OCEAN—CLARK 387

starfishes and the comatulids can swim freely for short distances;
some, like oysters and most stalked crinoids, live permanently at-
tached to other objects.

To mention in detail the economic interrelationships of all these
creatures would be an overwhelming task; and, indeed, very little is
known about them. But let us consider one or two examples.

The common mussel, like oysters and other bivalves, is preyed upon
by the common starfish, which is often most terribly destructive,
moving back and forth across the mussel beds in swarms and up and
down the piles where mussels grow. We have no figures on the dam-
age done the mussels, but in 1888, on the Connecticut coast alone, this
starfish destroyed $631,500 worth of oysters, after not less than
42,000 bushels of them had been taken from the beds. Mussels are
preferred to oysters by the starfish, and some beds have been entirely
destroyed by them. Various gastropods, oysterdrills, dogwelks,
winkles, conchs, and others eat vast quantities, while killifish, cunners,
scup, tautog, squeteague, flounders, and cod are very fond of them.
In fact, mussels are excellent bait for fish. The walrus in the Green-
land seas feeds exclusively on mussels, though the seals, like dolphins,
feed on fish and squid. On our coasts mussels are eaten by rats and
by such birds as large gulls, ravens, crows, and ducks.

Within the shells of oysters, pinnas, and the other larger bivalves
live flatworms, known as “wafers,” little crabs, small shrimps, and
sometimes other things, most of which, except the first, are harm-
less, or at least do no more than steal the food that they collect.

The very bony crinoids would seem to offer little in the way of
food for parasites, yet nearly 150 parasitic or semiparasitic forms
have been described from them. A little groove runs down the
middle of the upper side of the pinnules and the arms of crinoids,
and the five grooves from the five rays converge to the central
mouth. The minute creatures taken from the water are passed
down along these grooves in a constant stream, which becomes
richer and richer as more and more of the victims are delivered
to it by the side branches, and at the mouth forms a rich plankton
soup. Most of the crinoids’ parasites are simply grafters, camp-
ing along the sides of this stream and sucking up the soup. About
two-thirds of these belong to a curious type of worm, called my-
zostomes, which, except for three sorts, internal parasites in star-
fishes or brittle stars, are entirely confined to them. Crinoids sup-
port about two dozen kinds of crustaceans of several different types,
a few of which bore into the soft parts, but most of which ap-
propriate the food material they collect, either from their ambulacral
grooves or from their stomachs. Nearly a dozen kinds of brittle
stars have never been found except upon them, about a dozen kinds
of small gastropods bore into them and suck their juices, and they
support at least one internal worm and many protozoans. Barnacles,
388 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

hydroids, sponges, foraminifera, corals, rhabdopleurids, tunicates
and bivalves, and curious polyzoans grow upon them, using them as
a support to maintain themselves above the mud or sand. But
crinoids have one distinct advantage over mussels in that fishes
never eat them.

All sea animals are undoubtedly as complicated in their relation-
ships to others as are the mussels and the crinoids; each feeds upon
a more or less extensive list of organisms, and in its turn serves
as a source of food for many others.

The enemies of the smaller animals are mostly the larger and pre-
dacious ones. The enemies of the plantlike types are chiefly the graf-
ters and the food stealers. The enemies of the larger creatures, as
the sharks and whales, are the much smaller blood-sucking or in-
ternal parasites which, though much less conspicuous, are very
numerous and just as dangerous.

The birds of the seashores call for brief enumeration. The gulls,
very numerous in northern regions, are chiefly scavengers, feeding
upon whatever is cast up on the beaches or they are able to find upon
the flats when the tide is out; ravens and crows compete with them
along the shores, but are never very numerous, and are very much
less agile on the wing; both these last two prefer to consume their
booty in the woods, and often carry shells, starfish, and urchins for
some distance inland. Terns and skimmers eat crustaceans and small
fish, and fish and sometimes squid form the diet of the cormorants,
pelicans, bobies, frigate birds, tropic birds, and gannets. The reef
and night herons catch fish and various of the larger crustaceans,
while the very numerous shore birds eat aquatic insects, crustaceans,
marine worms, and small mollusks which they catch along the
water’s edge or on the rocks and beaches, some, like the phalaropes,
also on the surface of the sea. Interesting, but relatively unimport-
ant and not numerous in species, are the fish-consuming hawks,
eagles, kites, and vultures. The osprey is known to almost every-
one; so is the bald eagle, which often robs him of his prey as the
parasitic skuas and jegers do the gulls and terns. In the Aleutian
Islands this eagle is one of the most abundant land birds along the
shores, and is much easier to shoot than the small birds, which here
are very shy. In the harbors of the East the kites, soaring over the
water on the watch for scraps, look strange to us, accustomed as we
are to gulls alone. The condor and the California vulture frequent
the beaches more or less, and the nests of the latter often contain
mussel shells. Two of the cormorants, one, now extinct, but form-
erly common in the Commander Islands, the other living in the
Galapagos group, one auk, formerly abundant on the north Atlantic
coasts but now extinct, and all the penguins, are flightless.

Of other seacoast creatures there are the seals, which live on fish,
the walrus, which live on mussels, and the sea otter, now very rare
LIFE IN THE OCEAN—CLARK 389

and local, which eats largely, if not mainly, sea urchins. The sea
snakes, true snakes and poisonous, yet true sea animals, most of
them more helpless on land than eels, the seaweed eating iguanas of
the Galapagos, and the coypu of the inlets of southwestern South
America also deserve mention. But the most curious of all the
seacoast creatures is the large fish-eating bat of the Caribbean re-
gion, which smells strongly of musky fish oil and is abundant at
St. Vincent, where it spends the day in chinks and crevices in the
sea cliffs which one would think much too small for it.

What is the vegetable basis of this abundant coastal life?

On our north Atlantic coasts and on the coasts of Europe this
comes from four main sources.

1. Vegetable detritus, or the more or less decayed fragments of
the plants growing on the bottom, the seaweeds and the eelgrass,
suspended or dissolved in the water, lying on the bottom, or mixed
with the bottom mud.

According to very careful investigations which have been carried
on in Denmark all the bivalve mollusks, two snails, all the sea
cucumbers, sipunculids, cumaceans, sea squirts, ostracods, polyzoans,
sponges, and foraminifera, and the balanoglossids and cephalochor-
dates, as well as the beach-fly larvee, are purely detritus feeders;
the great mass of material in their alimentary tracts when analyzed
corresponds to the detritus on the ocean floor, and the free-floating
plants are only incidentally present. In the deepest water the
organic matter is probably chiefly derived from the free swimming
organisms which die and fall to the bottom, and in places from
the Sargassum and other rock weeds which have been torn from
their moorings and have perished far from land.

2. Plants growing on the bottom, chiefly eelgrass where that occurs,
upon which browse certain snails, like the periwinkles, a few echino-
derms, and some crustaceans. The Danish naturalists have found
that as a basis for the support of the shore-living animals these
plants (especially the eelgrass, the most abundant on the. Danish
coasts) are next in importance to detritus.

3. Free swimming microscopic plants, similar to those of the open
ocean. The Danes have found that these are of almost no importance
on their coasts; their slight value is indirect, through the medium
of the free swimming copepods. But probably elsewhere, especially
in Arctic and Antarctic regions where there is no eelgrass and they
are enormously abundant, they become of much significance.

4. Driftwood, floating or stranded in the water, and wooden struc-
tures, such as piles and wharves. ‘These, essentially vegetable
detritus, form the food of curious aberrant bivalves called ship-
worms or teredos, which bore into them and often cause enormous
damage. Other bivalves and various crustaceans, such as the gribble,
390 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

bore into wood and are often quite destructive, but the teredo is
the only creature known actually to live upon it.

THE DEEP SEA ANIMALS

In the open ocean there is abundant plant life at the surface,
almost entirely composed of microscopic types upon which feed
minute animals endowed with remarkable reproductive powers
through which the organic matter is passed on to larger creatures.
There are also floating seaweeds torn from the rocks and drifting
with the currents, growing more or less, though never fruiting,
which serve to some extent to feed the smallerreatures. The gulf-
weed or Sargassum, so common in the north Atlantic, is the most
familiar and important type.

Far below the surface in the twilight zone, where the daylight
gradually fades to darkness and plant life disappears, in the levels
to which most of the surface animals, at least in the clearer and more
sunlit portions of the seas, retreat during the day, lurk many pre-
daceous forms which never rise above it. Still farther down, in the
cold perpetual night where the motion of the waves is never felt,
the creatures of the twilight zone pass over into other types, all of
medium size or rather small, all good swimmers, and all or nearly
all with phosphorescent lights, like fireflies—strange fishes, squids,
crustaceans, jellyfishes, etc.—which, becoming fewer and fewer,
reach probably to the bottom, those of each level feeding upon the
animals from the zone above, and all being supported by the crea-
tures of the twilight zone which at night feed upon the plants. In
the north and in the south where the cold water, filled with living
particles, is less transparent, and the sun’s rays strike it at an angle
and do not penetrate so deeply, the twilight zone comes almost to
the surface and there is little difference between night and day
conditions.

Along the shores there is a greater or lesser abundance of large
alge or seaweeds of many sorts and of flowering plants living
fastened to the bottom. These are constantly dying and, partially
decaying, breaking up ‘into fine particles, this detritus floating about
in the water and finally coming to rest in the mud or sand. The’
microscopic plants of the open ocean, of course, exist here also, while
many kinds of diatoms and similar types live on the bottom and
clinging to the weeds. While a few animals here live by browsing
on the seaweeds and the eelgrass, the dominant animal types are
sluggish or sessile, or attached and usually arborescent plantlike
animals, living on the bottom or traveling over it, consuming the
detritus, with the more active animals consuming them, especially
the shellfish, crustaceans, and echinoderms.

What happens as the sea floor sinks farther and farther from the
surface ?
LIFE IN THE OCEAN—CLARK 391

The light gradually diminishes so that in the clearest and most
sunlit seas, at about 650 feet, there is only a pale moonlight at
noon on the brightest day, while at greater depths there is no light
at all. Wave motion dies away, and not far below the surface there
is perpetual quiet even in the fiercest hurricane. The temperature
declines, rapidly at first and then more slowly; in the abysses it is
mostly a few degrees above the freezing point—below it in some
places. The pressure increases so that at 15,000 feet it is about 214
tons to the square inch.

The number of kinds of animals found between tide marks, in
rock pools, on the beaches, or on piling, is relatively small, rapidly
increasing from the high to the low matric mark. Below ithe low-
tide mark the variety of animal life is markedly increased. Beyond
a slight depth, 50 feet or so, but varying in different places, within
which there are often well-marked zones, some of the shore forms
disappear, but other creatures take their places and still others con-
stantly appear at greater depths. The maximum variety of marine
animal types is found on bottoms between about 600 and 1,200 feet,
where the light is dim to almost absent, the water is cool and very
still, and there is abundant food provided by the shore detritus and
the sea above.

Within this zone there are many animals of large size, crabs 11
feet or more from claw to claw, huge urchins and starfish, great
plantlike things looking like small apple trees (Primnoa, etc.),
masses of large crinoids, stalked and unstalked, and other creatures,
and probably in certain places swimming about the giant squid and
cuttles.

Below this zone the stillness of the water and the increasing pres-
sure favor the deposit of the finest silt, and the bottoms are chiefly
of fine mud, passing into the so-called oozes made up of the shells
of the millions and millions of small creatures constantly dying in
the layers above. The greater part of the sea bottom beyond the
coastal muds is formed of globigerina ooze, consisting of the shells
of minute shelled animals, the oceanic foraminifera, largely globi-
gerinas, with some bottom-living types and a few other things.
Less common are the pteropod oozes, made up of the shells of oceanic
mollusks, the radiolarian oozes, and the diatom oozes. Toward the
middle of the oceans the oozes gradually pass into an excessively
fine red mud, which is the typical bottom of all the abysses far from
land.

On the red mud everywhere and sometimes on the oozes lie scat-
tered the ear bones of whales and the teeth of sharks, the only por-
tions of these animals that will persist indefinitely. Some of the
sharks’ teeth on the red mud are of gigantic size, several inches in
length, and came from species long extinct but known as fossils else-
392 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

where. On the ear bones and the teeth manganese slowly collects,
in time inclosing them in characteristic nodules of various sizes. As
over the red mud oceanic life is so very scanty as to be practically
nonexistent, these nodules for the most part probably represent the
remains of decrepit sharks and whales which have strayed out here
and died.

Below the twilight zone the variety of animal life rapidly lessens,
and, on account of the uniformity of conditions in all oceans at these
levels, becomes practically the same everywhere.

The basic food here consists of detritus from the plants along the
shores, decreasing rapidly in amount with distance from the land,
and a correspondingly increasing amount of organic matter derived
from the bodies of the creatures in the layers above which, dying,
sink gradually to the bottom, where further decay is arrested by the
‘perpetual cold and the great pressure which prevent, or at least
inhibit, the action of bacteria. The foraminifera, pteropods, di-
atoms, etc., and the Sargassum and other floating seaweeds dying
and going to the bottom carry there at least a portion of their or-
ganic substance, which mixes with the mud. This bottom ooze or
mud when brought on deck seems absolutely clean, but in the warm
air it soon gives forth a most offensive smell, proclaiming the organic
matter it contains.

This mud is swallowed by many of the bottom animals, particu-
larly by all of the numerous echinoderms, except the crinoids, and
by many of the crustaceans, which digest the organic matter out of
it, living in the same way that some of their relatives do along the
shores and the earthworms do on land. For the other animals, such
as the sponges, sea squirts, stalked crinoids, and cceelenterates, inter-
mediates are necessary to make this food available, and these inter-
mediates seem to be the numerous forms of radiolarians and related
types which, judging from the long stalks of the attached animals,
must in some places form a thin mist for some distance above the
sea floor.

Deep-sea animals are much more common near land off precipit-
ous coasts than at the same depths farther out, in correspondence
with the greater density of life in the layers above, and also under
cold surface water. They are, after all, only littoral types with
sufficiently adaptable natures to enable them to descend to the
greatest depths, and fundamentally they differ very much less from
the shore types than would be supposed. In the Tropics the dif-
ference between the littoral and the abyssal animals is great, and the
change from one sort to the other rather abrupt, but in the cold
regions many of the deep-sea types come up into shallow water.

The reasons why all sea animals are most abundant near the
land and gradually decrease in abundance and in size with increas-
LIFE IN THE OCEAN—CLARK 393

ing distance from the shores is that the nutritive material brought
to the sea by rivers and washed from the land by rain upon which
the plants subsist is most abundant here. On very precipitous
coasts the detritus from the seaweeds falls into deep water and adds
to the food supply of the deep-sea creatures, which elsewhere is
derived only from the remains of oceanic organisms.

The ocean’s deepest spot is 40 miles east of Mindanao, in the
Philippines, where a depth of 6.08 miles (32,113 feet, or 5,352
fathoms) has been determined.

No animal life is known from such a depth as this. The animal
from the greatest depth so far recorded is a fish (Grimaldichthys
profondissimus) which was brought up from 19,806 feet, or 334
miles, beneath the surface in the north Atlantic by the late Prince of
Monaco. Many other things, of course, must live at this depth also
for this fish to feed upon. It is perhaps worthy of remark that a
fish of the same type, a so-called brotulid, lives in fresh water in
the caves of Cuba.

It was once thought that the abysses would contain many relics
of past ages which had become extinct along the shores. But sur-
prisingly few such relic types have come to light, and there are not
nearly so many of them in the deep seas as are to be found along the
shores and in fresh water.

Of all the animals of the ocean floors the mud-swallowing echino-
derms are perhaps the most abundant and diversified and the most
generally distributed; but all the groups represented also occur
in shallow water except for a small number of minor types. The
most conspicuous of these echinoderms, because most strange to us,
are bizarre sea-cucumbers and starfish, and soft and flexible shelled
urchins. Stalked crinoids rooted in the ooze or firmly attached
to stones or other objects are characteristic of the deeps, but all the
groups represented, like all of those to which the more abundant un-
stalked forms belong, come up into shallow water, with possibly one
exception. The crinoids most important from the paleontological
viewpoint, the Pentacrinus of our textbooks, and the curious Holo-
pus, so far from being deep-sea animals, live, at Barbados, in 30
feet or less, so that they can be seen from the surface with a water
glass.

Sponges with silicious skeletons are often very abundant in the
deeps, especially near land. One of the chief trials of a deep-sea
naturalist is sorting over a catch with these thingsin the mud. Their
spicules are sharp as needles, glassy, and transparent, and scattered
everywhere, so that the sight of sponges always means sore hands.

1On September 1, 1924, a new “ deep” was reported 145 miles southeast of Tokyo. A

sounding here by the Japanese steamer Manshu gave 6.18 miles (32,636 feet, or 5,439
fathoms),
394 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Sailors, no matter how callous they may be toward other forms of
life, quickly learn to recognize silicious sponges.

The celenterates are the only group of animals of which a large
proportion of the types are confined to deep water. They are
abundant here, and of many different sorts. Especially characteristic
are the sea-pens and umbellularians and the curious anemones. There
are many corals, largely solitary ones, but no massive types, and
numerous alcyonarians and allied creatures.

Various sea squirts occur, both simple and compound.

Crustaceans are abundant, of all the principal marine groups ex-
cept the king crabs and the squillas, though barnacles are poorly
represented. They are mostly blind and spiny. There are a few
sea spiders or pycnogonids, some of which are very large; one single
kind lives all the way from the shore line down to 13,350 feet below
the surface.

Mollusks of all the principal groups except the pelagic occur; one
type, called solenogaster, a wormlike thing living on gorgonians and
apparently parasitic on them, is most abundant in deep water.
The gastropods or snails, though there are no remarkable forms in
the deep sea, are interesting in ranging from at least 16,000 feet
below the surface uninterruptedly to above the snow line in the
Himalayas.

The fishes are practically all of the bony or teleostean type, and
chiefly represent modifications of forms represented at or near the
surface in the cold and temperate zones, or which appear as nocturnal
oceanic forms. They are small, mostly black or dark sooty brown,
sometimes albinistic, blind or with large eyes, and often with long
filamentous processes.

Of the remaining animals there may be mentioned the few brachio-
pods, less interesting geologically than the littoral ones, some sipun-
culids, the few annelid worms, mostly living in calcareous or quill-
like tubes, the numerous radiolarians, and the foraminifera.

From this catalogue one might, perhaps gather the impression
that animal life in the abysses is abundant, which is far from true.
A net dragged for two or more hours over the sea floor, an operation
consuming almost an entire day, may bring up less than a handful
of animals, or even none at all. Rarely, and usually near shore off
precipitous coasts, are rich hauls made.

Like their relatives in shallow water, the deep-sea animals, es-
pecially the echinoderms and sponges and pennatulids, tend to live in
colonies. with various crustaceans, worms, etc., associated with them.
Sometimes the dredge brings up only the dead remains of such a
colony which has died from the exhaustion of the meager food sup-
ply, or from old age or other cause,
A STUDY OF THE FLIGHT OF SEA GULLS?

By Rosert C. MILLER

[With 4 plates]

No one who has traveled on the ferries which ply across San
Francisco Bay can have failed to note the sea gulls which follow
constantly in their wake. Hour after hour, day by day, sometimes
at night even, they may be seen winging tirelessly after the cumbrous
boats, sailing high like paper kites, or sporting in the currents of
air about the stern, or scuffling noisily for bits of food thrown over-
board by the passengers. In the earliest dawn they are on duty,
looking like gray specters in the morning mists, and on moonlit
nights they are abroad at least until midnight, flapping along like
giant bats in the semidarkness.

Of the many thousands of people who have watched the gulls on
the bay and admired their beauty, probably most have thought of
their graceful evolutions only as a part of nature’s artistry. But
for the ornithologist, the esthetic is not the sole nor even the prin-
cipal interest which attaches to them. Rather does he remark the
marvelous powers of flight which enable so large a bird to keep
aloft for long periods of time without fatigue, and the rapid coor-
dination which permits it to take advantage of every current of the
shifting air, and to maintain its equilibrium under the most adverse
circumstances of wind and weather.

On account of their large size, easy flight, and relatively slow wing
movements the gulls have long been looked upon as peculiarly favor-
able subjects for studies of avian aeronautics. However, although
our knowledge of their flight is rather extensive, as yet it is far from
complete. The data assembled by different observers are frequently
not in agreement, and, as Hankin (1913, p. 253) has pointed out,
two authorities as competent as Maxim and Headley have published
statements diametrically opposed. Such contradictory ideas must,
in most cases, indicate not that the observations on which they rest
are incorrect but only that they are inadequate; a type of behavior
which is observed on one or two occasions may be entirely lacking

1 Reprinted by permission from the Condor, Vol. XXV, January, 1923. The writer of

fornia in 1921-22 for the best study of any subject concerned with birds.

under other circumstances, and it would be a mistake to assume that
modes and methods of flight adapted to some particular set of condi-
tions hold true for all.

The writer became interested in some of these problems by watch-
ing the maneuvers of gulls about the ferryboats, and he began ac-
cordingly to take notes on their behavior with reference to the
speed and direction of the wind and other factors, as he had oc-
casion to cross the bay from time to time. The present paper is
based on a series of observations covering a period of about nine
months, from July, 1921, to March, 1922, during which time the
writer has on occasion laid himself open to suspicion of mental
aberration by rushing about on the deck of a ferryboat, gazing
seaward and skyward, and jotting down notes in a small black book.

The machinery of flight—the structure of wings and feathers and
the nice musculature which controls them—has been dealt with in
much detail by Headley (1895 and 1912), Hankin (1913), and
others. It is sufficient here to note that the wings are strong, rigid,
and light, that they are curved to offer the maximum resistance on
the downward and the minimum on the upward stroke, and that
the great wing feathers, by their shape, contribute materially to
the action of the muscles and relieve unnecessary strain. It is gener-
ally agreed that the muscles and tendons of the wing are so arranged
as to operate automatically, the motion which extends the humerus
mechanically extending the other units of the wing, even to spread-
ing the flight feathers. (This view has been objected to by Beet-
ham, 1911, p. 435.) It is important also to note that the tips of the
flexible flight feathers bend upward under the strain of any sudden
gust (pl. 2, F), thus allowing the wind to “slide off” from the under
surface of the wing and contributing automatically to the main-
tenance of equilibrium.

Having in mind these few notes on the mechanics of flight, we
may go on to consider the bird in action, which has been the major
object of these studies. Nothing appears more leisurely and effort-
less than the flight of gulls. The exertion by which they keep pace
with a steamer seems to be little more than an idle flapping, when
indeed they are not soaring on almost motionless wings above the
boat. But when we come to study more closely just what is taking
place, and particularly when we record photographically certain
movements that are too quick for the eye, we discover that more
energy is being expended than at first seemed to be the case.

The first point to be noticed is that the stroke of the wings is con-
siderably longer than appears to the eye; indeed, each time the pin-
ions are raised the inner segments almost meet above the body, and on
the downward beat the outer segments approach the perpendicular
beneath it. This can partially be seen when a bird passes directly on

— i; -
FLIGHT OF SEA GULLS—MILLER 397

a level with the eye, but can be fully demonstrated only by photo-
graphs which catch the wings at their highest and their lowest points.
The full sweep of the wings can be seen by a comparison of Plate 2,
A and B, which indicate respectively the beginning and the com-
pletion of a stroke. This is illustrated a little less perfectly by the
two birds in Plate 2, C; and in Plate 2, D, by a happy chance, five
(different phases of the stroke are represented, although neither the
full upward nor the full downward extension of the wings is shown.
It will be noted by studying the lowest bird in this figure that, on
the down stroke, the wing is sharply flexed at the wrist, the forearm
being nearly horizontal.

It should be remarked, however, that while the eye tends to un-
derestimate the length of the stroke, the camera somewhat ex-
aggerates it. The wing does not actually describe an arc of nearly
180°, as might be thought from its extreme upward and downward
extensions. It is to be remembered that the body of the bird is not
moving on a fixed plane, but undulates with each beat of the wings,
rising on the downward stroke and falling a little as the wings are
raised. This up and down motion appears from Marey’s figures
(1895, p. 287) to be about equal to the thickness of the body of the
bird. Thus when the wings move from the highest to the lowest
position of a beat, their tips describe a shorter arc than if the body
were fixed. The undulating motion of the body is usually concealed
from the observer for lack of a point of reference, or because it is
masked by the greater motion of the wings.

From the fact that the wing stroke is as long as we have de-
scribed, it follows that the beat must also be more rapid than it
gives the impression of being. This is found to be true when we un-
dertake to photograph a gull in action. The seemingly leisurely
flapping of the wings can rarely be caught by an exposure of less
than one two-hundredth of a second, and often shows movement at
even higher speeds than this (pl. 2, EK).

In ordinary flight a gull will average about 120 strokes per minute.
This involves a rather slow movement near the shoulder, but one
which becomes exceedingly rapid toward the tip of a long wing,
as we see in Plate 2, EK, and in the case of the lower right-hand bird
in Plate 2, F, where the humeri are sharply recorded, but the more
rapidly moving tips are blurred.

It is the rapidity of the wing stroke which is the secret of flight,
not of gulls alone, but of birds in general. The quick stroke suddenly
compresses the resilient air beneath the wing, and this has usually
been assumed by theorists to be the means by which the bird is sup-
ported; it rides on successive columns of compressed air. Rather,
however, should be emphasized the reciprocal of this; that is, that on
the downward stroke a momentary vacuum is left above the wing.
398 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

In other words, the air pressure is removed above but maintainea
beneath the pinion, so that it is supported theoretically by a force
approaching 14.7 pounds per square inch of surface. Of course, this
vacuum is by no means complete and is of very brief duration, but
it is obvious that the lifting power of the air beneath is ample to
support a much larger bird than a gull on the same wing area.

The displaced air can not rush in so quickly in the wake of a
large wing as in the wake of a small one. This explains why a gull
is able to support itself in the air with only two strokes per second,
while a sparrow, which really has a greater wing expanse in pro-
portion to its weight than a gull, must take 13 strokes per second
(Marey, 1890, p. 100). A large wing is intrinsically a more efficient
instrument of flight than a small wing, without reference to the
weight of the bird to be supported.

During the beat of the wings there is a certain forward and back-
ward, as well as up and down, motion, so that the wing tip describes

Fic. 1.—Theoretical trajectory of the wing tip, on a somewhat shortened horizontal scale

an ellipse with reference to the body of the bird, or, owing to the
forward movement of the bird, a series of loops (fig. 1), which be-
come more and more nearly closed with increasing acceleration of
flight. It is possible even that the trajectory of the wing tip is a
sort of figure 8, as Pettigrew (1847, pp. 15ff.) has insisted, and
Marey (1890, p. 140) has described for the crow; but the presence
of a secondary loop can not be determined by observation, and seems
rather doubtful.

Two phases of the loop described by the wing are to be seen in
Plate 2,C. The upper bird shows the wings advanced on the down
stroke (position A, fig. 1), while the lower bird has them retired on
the up stroke (position B, fig. 1). Plate 2, B, shows the wings with
the front margins almost vertical, as they would appear at position
C, Figure 1.

The effect of advancing the wings farther than normal is to ro-
tate the front margins upward, so that the ventral surface is directed
anteriorly, thus retarding forward flight. This is well shown in

Plate 3, Figure 1. These gulls were hovering with almost no forward
motion, picking up bits of food from the water without alighting.
The advanced wings, depressed tail, and lowered feet indicate the
efforts to check forward flight.

The feet are ordinarily held close against the under tail coverts in
flight (pl. 2, A, C, and E), but may be lowered and even the webs
spread out to act as “ brakes ” in retarding flight. The coordinated
use of feet and tail for this purpose is admirably shown in Plate 2, F,
especially in the bird only partly included at the top of the photo-
graph.

In rising from the water a further use of the feet becomes evident
(pl. 3, fig. 2). A certain forward momentum is necessary before the
bird can rise, and a gull may often be seen contributing to the efforts
of its wings by kicking vigorously as it leaves the water.

However complicated may be the process of flapping flight, so
long as a bird’s wings are in motion we are able to understand, at
least in a measure, how it keeps aloft; but what are we to say when
we witness a large bird sailing for great distances on almost motion-
less pinions without loss of altitude, or even steadily gaining altitude
with no more effort than the occasional twitch of a wing in making
an adjustment to some sudden gust? ‘This is the phenomenon re-
ferred to as soaring flight, which has ever been a source of wonder-
ment to layman and scientist alike.

While the gulls are not masters of this type of aerial navigation
to quite the same extent as the larger hawks and vultures, neverthe-
less they often give remarkable exhibitions of their powers along this
line. It is a common sight to observe a gull travel several miles at
a speed of from 12 to 18 knots per hour without a single flap of the
wings; and I think it probable that much higher speeds than this
would be recorded if there were faster steamers on the bay to
serve as a basis of comparison.

Various theories have been proposed from time to time to account
for soaring flight, some of which are plausible, while others are
rather obviously at variance with the facts.

It has been commonly urged that a soaring bird has gotten into an
upward current of air, in which it has only to maintain itself by
proper adjustments, retaining its height or ascending according to
the force of the rising current and the angle of its wings. In other
words, soaring flight is simply a downward glide in an ascending
column of air.

It has been objected to this that birds are often seen to soar in the
absence of any ascending current, so far as can be detected, and
even that they studiously avoid such currents (Hankin, 1913, pp.
19, 63, etc.).
400 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Lilienthal (1911, p. 78) advanced the somewhat surprising theory
that the general trend of the wind everywhere is upward at an angle
3° to 4° to the horizon. The logical difficulties of such a theory
are rather obvious, as at this rate we should shortly be living in
a vacuum; and Headley (1895, p. 238) has comfortingly demon-
strated that the direction of a wind over a level plain is horizontal,
although a very slight obstruction may cause a pronounced upward
draft.

Opponents of the ascending current theory have proposed numer-
ous other, and often less adequate, hypotheses to account for soar-
ing flight.

Some have postulated a wavelike or pulselike motion of the air;
according to this theory, the bird gains momentum by gliding with
the wind in the interim between gusts, and gains altitude by turn-
ing to face each freshening breeze (Headley, 1895, p. 246). Others
have maintained that small eddies or whirlpools in the air are taken
advantage of, the bird meeting them and gaining energy by ex-
tinguishing their motion (Hankin, 1913, p. 62). A few have even
urged that soaring flight is an illusion, the wings really being in
motion, slight, but sufficient to keep the bird aloft. This rather
strained hypothesis has probably been suggested by the occasional
balancing movements which soaring birds are seen to make.

In the American Naturalist for 1886 we find a very remarkable
theory advanced by I. Lancaster, which, stated briefly, is this: A
properly constructed glider will move in a horizontal direction much
more rapidly than it descends vertically. ‘The more the wings are
inclined, the greater becomes the horizontal motion relative to the
vertical. If the wings are sufficiently inclined, as he assumes to
be the case in the soaring bird, theoretically (?) the vertical motion
should entirely cease, the pull of gravity causing only horizontal
motion. This seems to be a roundabout way of stating that a soar-
ing bird is really held up by the force of gravity!

A curious consequence of this theory was that Professor Hendricks
(1886) thought it necessary to reply in a subsequent issue of the same
journal with several pages of complicated mathematical disproof,
demonstrating by various formule that the effect of gravity would
actually be, not to support a soaring bird, but rather to bring it to
earth!

A more recent investigator (Hankin, 1913) has discarded all
theories having a basis in any known physical laws, and insists, on
the grounds, be it said, of much excellent observation, that soaring
flight must be referred to some entirely unknown quality of the
atmosphere, which he terms “soarability.” Of this he postulates
two kinds, “sun soarability”” and “wind soarability.” Neither of

FLIGHT OF SEA GULLS—MILLER 401

these depends upon ascending currents, but rather upon some mys-
terious transfer of sun (pp. 98, 105, 206) or wind (pp. 278 ff.)
“energy ” to the soaring bird. Such a theory can hardly be looked
upon as doing aught but removing the phenomenon from the realm
of possible explanation to that of pure mystery.

It seems at present that the earliest and simplest of these theories,
that of ascending currents, is the most plausible. So far as the
writer has been able to observe, it is entirely adequate to explain
the soaring of gulls. The following extracts from my notes will
indicate the basis of this statement:

August 17, 2.20 p. m.—Clear, bright day; stiff west wind. Several gulls ob-
served sporting in current of air deflected upward by ferry slip at Oakland
Mole. Would glide west some yards on motionless
wings, gradually losing altitude, then rotate wings so as xX
to be caught by breeze and swept back into ascending
current, in which they would speedily rise with no
visible effort and repeat the performance. This con-
tinued about five minutes, until birds were disturbed
by coming of a boat.

August 13, 5.30 p. m.—Stiff west wind; several x
gulls soaring a few yards above and slightly to the
leeward of the highest point on Goat Island.

July 29, 10.50 a. m—Ferry traveling against stiff
west wind. Gulls observed at points S, XX, and Y
(fig. 2). Those at XX flapped continually. Those at Y
took a zig-zag course, alternately flapping and sailing;
they would gain momentum by flapping vigorously
while in the shelter of the stern, then dive to one side iy //
into the wind and sail a moment, quickly losing mo-
mentum but gaining altitude. Then, from this increased |

height, they would dive back into the shelter of the

stern, usually adding to their momentum by flapping,

and continued across into the wind on the other side, Fic. 2—Diagram of po-

where they would again gain altitude with the loss sitions of gulls about

of momentum. This was repeated indefinitely, like Bre eae oreiore
’ against the wind

a sort of play.

Several gulls were soaring without effort just above the forward pilot
house. There was scarcely a visible wing movement so long as they re-
mained in the area S (upward draft from bow), but they had to resort to
flapping whenever they drifted to one side or the other of this area. (On
several occasions a gull has been observed very distinctly to fall off this up-
ward current, and drop suddenly somewhat laterally for 10 or 15 feet before
righting itself. :

July 30, 11.40 a. m.—Ferry going west against light breeze. Three gulls
soared smoothly just above forward pilot house, balancing by occasional flick
of wing tips.

7.30 p. m.—Ferry going east, with light wind from stern. Several gulls fol-
lowed, flapping, at a distance. No soaring was attempted.

August 1, 3.20 p. m.—Ferry going west against very stiff wind. Very little
soaring attempted, and only for a few moments at atime. One bird, alternately
flapping and sailing, was caught by a sudden gust, almost capsized, and turned
402 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

completely around. In two or three seconds it righted and began following
boat again.

November 6, 2.30 p. m.—Ierry going west; fair wind from starboard. A
number of gulls soared over windward side, moving sidewise and forward, with
left wing advanced (pl. 4, figs. 1 and 2) ; that is, the birds were moving with the
boat, while facing a point halfway between the course of the boat and the
direction of the wind.

3.40 p. m.—Ferry going east; wind from port. Birds soared as before, on
windward side, but with right wing advanced, as would be expected from
reversed direction of flight.

Their method of soaring was carefully observed. They would rise in the
upward current at windward side until at a considerable height, then drift
forward and laterally, to right or left, with gradual loss of altitude, until
they circled back into the ascending current and rose again. Thus their flight
was a series of circlings in and out of the ascending column of air, with a
steady forward glide to keep pace with the boat. The wings were held nearly
motionless, and slightly flexed (pl. 1) to derive the maximum lifting power of
the wind.

The chronological order of these excerpts has been intentionally
disturbed, in order that they may furnish illustrations respectively
of the following points:

1. That gulls take advantage of the air currents deflected upward
from buildings, steamers, hillsides, etc., to indulge in soaring flight.

2. That they have not been observed to soar in the absence of such
currents.

3. That the most favorable conditions for soaring about a steamer
occur with a moderately brisk wind from the bow, or either side.

4. That a very stiff wind is not favorable to soaring.

5. That the “soarable” position varies with the direction and speed
of the wind, and the nature of the object causing the upward draft.
Thus, in a moderate wind from starboard, the gulls soared over the
windward side of the boat, while in a stiff breeze over the crest of Goat
Island they soared to the leeward of the island. It has been observed
also that, with increasing briskness of the wind about the ferryboats,
the soarable area tends to move more and more to the leeward. This
may explain the confusion which has existed upon the point (Han-
kin, 1913, p. 253), some observers reporting that gulls soar on the
windward, others that they soar on the leeward side of steamers.

In conclusion it should be stated that these data are not intended
to furnish an adequate explanation of soaring flight in general, but
only of that of the gulls as I have observed it. It is entirely possible
that, in the magnificent soaring of eagles and vultures, particularly
as seen in the tropics, other factors may enter. Conditions at a
height of 1 or 2 miles must be very different. from what they are at
the relatively small heights to which gulls attain.

But if, as some maintain, birds are able to soar in the absence of
any noticeable upward movement of the air, it is yet entirely pos-
FLIGHT OF SEA GULLS—MILLER 403

sible that such currents may be in operation, due to convection or
other causes of atmospheric disturbance with which aeronauts are
unpleasantly familiar. The wing of a bird, particularly of a large
bird, is, as we have shown above, an extremely efficient instrument,
capable of immediate adjustment to derive the maximum advantage
from every movement of the air, so that a very slight upward draft
may yield it considerable lift.

In any case, it seems wiser to go as far as we can with explana-
tions in terms of known physical laws, rather than to postulate
forces of which we know nothing, and which, if they exist, we have
little chance of discovering.

INSECT MUSICIANS, THEIR MUSIC, AND THEIR
INSTRUMENTS

By R. E. SNopeRrAss

Bureau of Entomology, United States Department of Agriculture

THE SEASON’S PROGRAM

There is something peculiarly quiet about the evenings of spring
and early summer in any country place sufficiently removed from
the highways of human traffic, and from frog ponds. Robins may
be warbling fragments of their song, or more commonly uttering
that loud clatter with which they accompany their short flights from
place to place, a song sparrow in the distance sings his bedtime
melodies, a catbird is mewing from the hedge, a thrasher practices
a few of his borrowed notes, a nighthawk makes a sudden swoop
from overhead. As the shadows deepen, however, and the line of dis-
tant trees fades against the sobering sky, bird voices cease and
the darkness brings silence, silence broken only at times by the
song of some irrepressible mocker that continues his effervescence
to uncertain hours, by the hoot of an owl, or by that long trill of
the chipping sparrow which occasionally, in moonlight, rises at dead
of night from somewhere in the fantastic, hazy distance.

But, on one of those first warm evenings toward the end of May,
when the air is motionless though not yet sultry in southern Mary-
land, as the sun’s fiery tints on the fleecy lining of sky give way to
the paler tones of moonlight, there comes from somewhere on the
lawn the first heralding of that troupe of insect choristers that later
will make the night air ring from dusk to dawn with the strident
music of their serenades. The announcement is a cheerful chzrp,
chirp, chirp, strong and clear but vibratory, the unmistakable notes
of Gryllus, the common black cricket. These early arrivals belong
to a group just now maturing that hatched the preceeding summer
and wintered in a half-grown stage. For a month or more their
vigorous chirps are heard in town and country, and then again there
is silence, an interlude before the regular concert begins.

The season advances, the hot nights of July arrive, thunder-
storms come and go, each leaving in its wake that oppressive evening

1454—25——27 405
406 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

stillness reeking with moisture. On such a night, perhaps, toward
the middle of July, as you may be meditating on nature’s mightier
forces, suddenly, from a near-by tree or shrub, you hear a voice,
or the semblance of one, which says: treat, treat, treat, treat, regular
repetitions of the one note 140 times a minute. Over there it is
echoed by another, and over yonder by another. The next night still
more join in, and soon the very atmosphere vibrates to that monoto-
nously measured beat. This is the music of the snowy tree cricket,
first of the summer chorus to arrive upon the stage.

A few nights later another sound cuts across the rhythmic concert,
a longer, purring note, sad and melancholy in tone as if from some
complaining spirit of the night, a soft burr-r-r, prolonged about two
seconds and repeated at intervals of equal length. This is the song
of the narrow-winged tree cricket, a cousin of the snowy. Repre-
sentatives of his species likewise come on in greater numbers every
evening till soon the nightly chorus is a blend of treats and burrs.

Then, to add to the confusion, several other bands arrive that
strike up long unbroken trills, continued for many seconds or several
minutes and immediately begun again. The chorus of the snowy
and the narrow-winged now falls into the background and individual
voices are lost as the entire concert becomes a ringing and shrilling
arising at twilight, increasing with darkness, so invisibly linked
with the oncoming shadows that it seems almost to be an emanation
from the night itself. The trillers are also tree crickets, relations
of the snowy and the narrow-winged, all members of the genus called
Oecanthus. One of them is distinguished as the black-horned or
striped tree cricket, another as the four-spotted, and a third as the
broad-winged. The last is the loudest singer of them all.

As the hot weather waxes and the steamy nights of midsummer
close in, some evening there will be heard from the lower branches
of a tree just outside the door or from the vines about the porch a
sharp tzcet, tzeet, tzeet, shrill notes quickly repeated perhaps a dozen
times in succession but less rapidly and less sharply toward the end
of the series. This is the song of the angular-winged katydid, not
the true katydid, not that great singer of the forests, but a relation
of his of larger stature, though of lesser talent.

Along with the angular-winged katydids come other members of
the katydid family. Amongst them are the coneheads, sharp-headed,
grasshopperlike insects, one of which, common in Maryland, makes a
long continuous whirr of a very shrill tone and in a key so high that
some human ears are not attuned to hear it at its highest pitch. An-
other utters a series of little notes like tic, tic, tic, repeated indefinitely.
There is also another who is one of the noisiest of all American insect
singers, his song being an extremely loud, shrill buzz of such volume
that it ean be heard from long distances. But this artist is so partial
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 407

to sandy fields near the seacoast that he is seldom heard by inland
audiences. Most of the other actors on the stage at this season sing
in tones so modest and subdued that their notes are generally lost in
the all-pervading din of the crickets and other louder voiced per-
formers. All save one, and this one is that star of the insect opera,
the famous katydid.

To hear the true katydid you must ordinarily go to the deep woods,
to the lonesome places of the night, for this virtuoso is no common
dooryard singer. High in the oaks and hickories he dwells and there
he and his troupe give their nightly serenades of katy-did’, katy-did’,
katy-she-did’, and sometimes katy-didn’t, a sound unmistakable and
one never forgotten when once heard. The performance lasts all
night and subsides only with the coming of dawn when insect concerts
close.

About the middle of August, Gryllus, the black cricket, comes on
the stage again, this time represented by more numerous individuals
that hatched in spring from overwintering eggs. From now on his
chirp is to be heard everywhere from lawn, garden, and field, both
by day and by night, a sound always cheerful and always to be
recognized by its vibratory quality. Associated with Gryllus is an-
other smaller cricket of the turf, a very little fellow called Nemobius,
with a very little voice, and one so delicate that you must bend low
to catch his elfin notes, a silvery, twittering trill, rising like the music
of some unseen pygmy from the grass.

Shortly after the advent of the second Gryllus band a new note
breaks out, a loud, piping chirp inflected upward at the end, a sound
easily mistaken for that of some little tree toad. The notes are hard
to locate precisely, they seem to come from here, from there, from
over yonder, and from back here again, but always singly. Their
clear tones stand out distinctly above the general ring of mingled
voices now at the peak of intensity, and, as nightly they become more
numerous, they soon preempt the stage. They are the song of another
cricket, the jumping bush cricket, more dignified by his scientific name
of Orocharis.

Of course, the reader must understand that this program does not
apply to all places alike. It is written for the neighborhood of Wash-
ington, D.C. Orocharis, for example, is abundant in Maryland but
would be seldom heard in New England. Likewise, in New England
the trilling tree crickets are less common, and consequently there the
notes of the snowy and the narrow-winged have greater prominence.
The katydids of New England also are less melodious than are those
along the Potomac. In the South, especially in Florida, there are
other singers that do not reach the latitude of Washington; while
few of our common eastern favorites are to be heard in California.
408 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

But the insect musicians are not all minstrels of the night; there
are daytime concerts, too, and the bill includes, besides the strictly
daylight performers, some of the nocturnal singers. Gryllus, for
example, sings at all hours, and the black-horned tree cricket makes
the waysides ring with his shrill notes on warm bright afternoons
of fall. Others of too little consequence to mention here will be de-
scribed later. The great artist of the day is the cicada, an insect
whose individuality sets him apart from all others. His song is
that familiar, long, loud, buzzing hum which floats from the trees
in undulous tones during the hot weather of August and September.
Unfortunately, we commonly call the cicada a “locust,” a name
which properly belongs to the grasshoppers. The famous 17-year
locust is a cicada that comes only periodically on the stage, but then
often in vast numbers, and his grand concerts are notable events
long remembered and discussed.

Orocharis is the last performer to appear on the nocturnal pro-
gram. No other new notes after his are to be heard, though the
voices of the others will change. As the cold of fall increases, the
clear treat, treat, treat of the snowy cricket becomes a broken rattle,
the sonorous purr of the narrow-winged changes to a long hoarse
rasp, the notes of the trillers become weak and subdued, the cheerful
chirps of Gryllus feeble and shaky, the notes of Orocharis dulled and
tremulous. Yet on a cold wet night, such as those that so frequently
mar the autumn season in southern New England, when the whole
world seems blanketed in a dismal, cold, and penetrating mist, wetter
than rain itself, it is marvelous to hear the insects still painfully
proceeding with their concerts under circumstances that would
stiffen the limbs and deaden the vital forces of many a stronger crea-
ture. The little tree crickets, themselves the very essence of frailty,
not only keep their fires burning amidst their sodden environment,
but still have emotions that must be expressed in song. And how
gay and cheerful they seem again when the weather moderates, and
how hopeful their voices sound on those last warm nights of fall.
But at last the killing frosts arrive, insect voices are stilled, and the
season’s concert series ends.

The preceding is just a résumé of what there is to be heard on
the insect stage day and night through the musical season. The con-
certs are all free and open to the public, but whoever would make
acquaintance with the musicians themselves will find that this is
not to be done by merely attending their performances, for condi-
tions are quite different on the insect stage from what they are on our
own. In the first place there is no conductor and all the artists,
soloists and choristers alike, insist on coming on at the same time,
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 409

with a consequent medley of voices quite confusing to the uninformed
listener. Then, too, the daylight performers usually sing from be-
hind the scenes, while the stage at night is never illuminated, ex-
cept by natural moonlight. Finally, the actors are bashful, avoid
publicity, and most of them refuse to perform in limelight—interest-
ing data for the student of comparative psychology. But there
are no reserved seats in the theater, and the front rows are never
crowded, consequently any interested member of the audience,
by using sufficient caution, may get close enough to an individual
singer to throw on him a quick flash from a lantern and catch a
glimpse of him as he performs. Furthermore, with a little dexterity,
the artist may be caught uninjured in a jar and taken home. If
treated well, given leaves or whatever food he requires, and espe-
cially fresh drinking water every morning in the form of artificial
dew made by sprinkling water on the foliage in his cage, the captive
soon becomes accustomed to human surroundings and will often give
private rehearsals, even sometimes in the glare of electric lights.

The rest of this paper is occupied mostly with the characteristics
and personalities of our best known American insect singers, those
of the eastern half of the Northern States. They all belong to four
families, three being families of the order Orthoptera, including the
grasshoppers, the katydids, and the crickets, and the other a family
of the order Hemiptera, or sucking insects, which comprises the
cicadas. The great majority of insects do not make any sounds at
all audible to our ears. A few besides those just mentioned, such as
some beetles, certain ants, and the queen bee produce squeaking or
rasping sounds of various sorts, but they are seldom noted by human
observers other than professional entomologists.

The reader may find interesting accounts of the habits and songs
of American Orthoptera in the works of Allard, Blatchley, McNeill,
Parrott and Fulton, Piers, Rehn and Hebberd, Scudder, Somes,
Walker, and others. Butt the numerous papers by these writers are
scattered through many entomological publications, and the student
will obtain easiest reference to all of them and abstracts from most
of them, as well as almost all that is known of our eastern grass-
hoppers, katydids, crickets, and their relations in Blatchley’s Or-
thoptera of Northeastern America. Scudder has given interpreta-
tions of the songs of the Orthoptera expressed in conventional musi-
cal notation, but the present writer knows nothing of the technique of
music and can present the insect notes only by the usual approximate
phonetic translations.

The critical reader has probably already made note of some mix-
ing of metaphors. Therefore, before going further, it must be
410 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

clearly stated that insects really do not sing; that is, not if the verb
“to sing” is to be used to refer only to the production of sounds
by the breath on vocal chords. Zhe music of insects is all instru-
mental; but it has always been described as “ singing,” even by the
best entomologists, and we shall not here discard a term so conven-
ient, especially since the dictionaries allow its more liberal usage. If
then it is permitted to refer to an insect’s music as its “song,” by
_the same license we may speak of its “ voice,” though no insect makes
truly vocal sounds. Likewise the word “note” is commonly used in
zoology to mean the sound produced by a bird or insect, and in
such connection does not signify a note on a musical scale. In strict-
ly technical writing, the sounds or notes made by insects are called
stridulations, from the Latin word stridere, meaning “to creak.”
They are made by special stridulating organs. These organs mostly
correspond with the drum type of musical instruments in that they
consist of membranes (tympana) or other broad surfaces that give
forth sound by being set into rapid vibration. But there are two
methods of producing the vibration, one by the rubbing of one sur-
face on another, which may be likened to fiddling, and the other by the
direct action of muscles attached to the vibratory surface, a method
which has no counterpart in human organs or instruments. Finally,
with very few exceptions, it is only the males among insects that
sing or that have stridulating organs. This affords a suggestive
theme for comparative comment, but it is one already too much
dwelt upon by human writers, of the male sex, and we shall proceed
now with the special descriptions of our musicians, their music, and
their instruments.

THE GRASSHOPPER FAMILY

The grasshoppers belong to the family Acridide of the order
Orthoptera. They are also designated the shorthorn grasshoppers
to distinguish them from grasshopperlike members of the katydid
family, or the longhorn grasshoppers, but they are more distinctively
called locusts, though this name is applied mostly to certain mi-
gratory species. In the United States, however, the term “ locust ”
has been given to the cicadas, resulting in much popular confusion
of identities. For example, those destructive insects called locusts
in the Bible are grasshoppers, related to our Rocky Mountain locust,
but in no way related to the insects we commonly call the 17-year
locusts, or to any other of the cicadas.

Not many of the grasshoppers are musical. They are mostly sedate
creatures that conceal their sentiments if they have any; they are
awake in the daytime and they sleep at night—commendable habits,
but habits that seldom beget much in the way of artistic attainment.
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 411

Yet a few of the grasshoppers make sounds that are perhaps music
in their own ears. One such is an unpretentious little brown species
(fig. 1) about seven-eighths of an inch in length, marked by a large
black spot on each side of the saddlelike shield that covers his back
between the head and the wings. He has no other name than his
scientific one of Chlocaltis conspersa, for he is not widely known,
since his music is of a very feeble sort. According to Scudder, his
only notes resemble tsikh-tsikk-tsikk, repeated 10 or 12 times in about
three seconds in the sun, but at a slightly slower rate in the shade.
Chloealtis is a fiddler and plays two instruments at once. The fiddles
are his front wings and the bows his hind legs. On the inner surface
of each hind thigh or femur there is a row of minute teeth (fig. 1,
B, a), shown more magnified at C. When the thighs are scraped over
the edges of the wings their teeth scrape on a sharp-edged vein indi-

(twice natural size), showing stridulating vein (b) of left wing. B, inner surface of

fiotes contain little music to.us, but Scudder says he has seen three
males singing to one female at the same time. This female, however,
was busy laying her eggs in a near-by stump, and there is no evidence
given to show that even she appreciated the efforts of her serenaders.

Several other little grasshoppers fiddle after the manner of Chloe-
altis; but another, Mecostethus gracilis by name (fig. 2), instead of
having the rasping points on the legs, has on each fore wing one of
the veins (B, 7) and its branches provided with many small teeth,
shown enlarged at C, upon which it scrapes a sharp ridge on the inner
surface of the hind thigh.

In another group of grasshoppers there are certain species that
make a noise as they fly, a crackling sound apparently produced in
some way by the wings themselves. One of these, common through
the Northern States, is known as the cracker locust, Circotettia ver-
412 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

ruculatus, on account of the loud snapping notes it emits. Several
other members of the same genus are also cracklers, the noisiest be-
ing a western species called C. carlingianus. Scudder says he has
had his attention drawn to this grasshopper “by its obstreperous
crackle more than a quarter of a mile away. In the arid parts of
the West it has a great fondness for rocky hillsides and the hot
vicinity of abrupt cliffs in the full exposure to the sun, where its
clattering rattle reechoes from the walls.”

One of the commonest of our larger grasshoppers is the Carolina
locust, Dissosteira carolina. Its exposed colors are mottled to match

the tones of the ground, but when it flies it unfolds a striking dis-
play of black bordered with yellow on its fanlike hind wings
(fig. 8). This locust is a strong flier and when flushed sails away
in the air on an undulating course over the tops of weeds, over bushes,
and sometimes over the tops of small trees, but always swerving this
way and that as if undecided where to alight. At times it has a
habit of hovering several feet up in the air over a certain spot on the
ground and of making a subdued crackling with the wings.
Various observers have noted these hovering flights of the Carolina
focust, performed always by the males as if they were holding some
sort of a contest in aeronautics. Townsend, seeing a male alight on
the ground after hovering for some time, noted in a few minutes
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 413

another male, “ which had witnessed the performance at a short dis-
tance,” fly quickly over and alight by the side of the first performer.
He says, “they ran by each other several times, occasionally touching
each other, but did not make any further manifestations, and finally
the last one flew away, leaving the other motionless in the grass.”
Townsend thinks it probable that the females are attracted by these
performances of the males, and that the males vie with one another
in their exhibitions and are inclined to fight from a feeling of rivalry,
the one that flies away having been beaten. He says “there is little
doubt that in some instances the males actually clasp and fight”
(though no instance is given), “but that more often one of them
admits his defeat without recourse to blows.” Finally, he concludes,

“the females doubtless are in waiting in convenient spots, from
which they witness these scenes, and ultimately accept the males
whose superior intimidating powers have resulted in their being left
in undisputed possession.” This passage would be more convincing
if it were not for that word “ doubtless.” On the other hand, Somes,
another observer of the hovering performances of the same locust,
suggests that they are merely games of sport between the males,
“possibly akin to the jumping contests of small boys.” All of which
shows how diffcult it is for us to interpret the behavior of insects.

The grasshoppers have a pair of eardrumlike membranes sunken in
large cavities on the sides of the body beneath the bases of the wings
(fig. 32, ¢), which are supposed to be hearing organs, the detail
structure of which will be described in the last section of this paper.

THE KATYDID FAMILY

While the grasshoppers give examples of the more primitive at-
tempts of insects at musical production, and may be compared in
this respect to the more primitive of human races, the katydids show
the highest development of the art attained by insects. But, just as
the accomplishments of one member of a human family may give
prestige to all his relations and descendents, so the talent of one
noted member of the katydid family has given notoriety to all his
congeners, and his justly deserved name has come to be applied by
the undiscriminating public to a whole tribe of singers of lesser or
very mediocre talent whose only claim
to the name of katydid is that of family
relationship.

In Europe the true katydid is un-
Known, and there his family is called
simply the longhorn grasshoppers. In
entomology the family is now the Tet-
tigoniide, though it had long been.
B known as the Locustide.

The katydids in general are most easily
distinguished from the locusts or short-
horn grasshoppers by the great length
of their antennae, those delicate, sensi-
tive, tapering threads projecting from the

forehead. But the two families differ
also in the number of joints in their feet,
the grasshoppers having three (fig. 4, A)
and the katydids four (B). The grass-
hoppers place the entire foot on the

ground, while the katydids ordinarily walk on the three basal seg-
ments only, carrying the long terminal joint elevated. The basal
segments have pads on their under sides that adhere to any smooth
surface such as that of a leaf, but the terminal joint bears a pair of
claws, used when it is necessary to grasp the edge of a support. The
katydids are mostly creatures of the night and, though usually plain
green in color, many of them have elegant forms. Their attitudes
and general comportment suggest much more refinement and a higher
breeding than that of the heavy-bodied locusts. ‘Though some mem-
bers of the katydid family live in the fields and are very grasshop-
perlike or even cricketlike in form and manners, the characteristic
species are seclusive inhabitants of shrubbery or trees. These are
the true aristocrats of the Orthoptera.
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS

The musical instruments of the katydids are quite different from
those of the grasshoppers, being situated on the overlapping bases of

the front wings or tegmina.

On this account the front wings of

the males are always different from those of the females, the latter

retaining the usual or primitive structure.

The right wing of a

female of one of the more grasshopperlike species, Orchelumum

laticauda (fig. 16), is shown
at C of Figure 5. The wing
is traversed by four prin-
cipal veins springing from
the base. The one nearest
the inner edge is called the
cubitus (Cu) and the space
between it and this margin
of the wing is filled with
a network of small veins
having no particular ar-
rangement. In the wings
of the male, however,
shown at A of the same
figure, this inner basal field
is much enlarged and con-
sists of a thin, crisp mem-
brane (7m), braced by a
number of veins branching
from the cubitus (Cu).
One of these (fv), running
crosswise through the mem-
brane, is very thick on the
left wing, and when the
wing is turned over (#) it
is seen to have a close series
of small cross ridges on its
under surface which con-
vert it into a veritable file
(f). On the right wing
this same vein is much

more slender and its file is very weak, but on the basal angle of
this wing there is a stiff ridge (s) not developed on the other. The
katydids always fold the wings with the left overlapping the right,
and in this position the file of the former lies above the ridge

(s) of the latter.

If now the wings are moved sideways, the file

grating on the ridge or scraper causes a rasping sound, and this is

the way the katydid makes the notes of its music.

The tone and
416 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

volume of the sound, however, are probably in large part due to
the vibration of the thin basal membranes of the wings, which are
called the tympana (7Z’m).

The instruments of different players differ somewhat in the details
of their structure. There are variations in the form and size of
the file and the scraper on the wings of different species, and
differences in the veins supporting the tympanal areas, as shown in
the drawings of these parts from a conehead (fig. 13) given at A, B.
and C, of Figure 6. In the
true katydid, the greatest
singer of the family, the
file, the scraper, the tym-
pana, and the wings them-
selves (fig. 12) are all very
highly developed to form
an instrument of great effi-
ciency. But, in general, the
instruments of different
species do not differ nearly
so much as do the notes
produced from them by
their owners. An endless
number of tunes may be
played upon the same
fiddle. With the insects
each musician knows only
one tune, or a few simple

f- variations of it, and this he

not functionally developed
until maturity, and then the insect forthwith plays his native air. He
never disturbed the neighbors with doleful notes by practicing.

Very curiously none of the katydids nor any members of their
family have the earlike organs on the sides of the body possessed
by the locusts. What are commonly supposed to be their organs of
hearing are located in their front legs, as are the similar organs of
the crickets. Two vertical slits on the upper parts of the shins or
tibiz (fig. 6, D, ¢) open each into a small pocket with a tympanum-
like membrane stretched across its inner wall. Between the mem-
branes are air tubes and other structures, to be described later along

INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 417

with the “ears” of the grasshopper. No one can state positively that
any of these organs are ears, the principal reasoning in favor of
their auditory nature being “if they are not ears, what are they?”

THE ROUND-HEADED KATYDIDS

The members of this first group of the katydid family are char-
acterized by having large wings and a smooth round forehead. They
compose the subfamily Phaneropterinz, which includes species that
attain the acme of grace, elegance, and refinement to be found in
the entire Orthopteran order. Nearly all of the round-headed katy-
dids are musical to some degree, but their productions are not of a

high order. On the other hand, though their notes are in a high
key, they are usually not loud and not of the kind that keep you
‘awake at night.

Amongst this group are the bush katydids, species of medium size
with slenderer wings than the others, comprised in the genus usually
known as Scudderia but also called Phaneroptera. They have ac-
quired the name of bush katydids because they are usually found
on low shrubbery, particularly along the edges of moist meadows,
though they inhabit other places too and their notes are often heard
at night about the house. Our commonest species, and one that
occurs over most of the United States, is the fork-tailed bush katydid
(Scudderia furcata). Figure 7 shows a male and a female, the
female in the act of cleaning the pads on one of her hind feet.
”
418 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

The katydids are all very particular about keeping their feet clean,
for it is quite necessary to have their adhesive pads always in perfect
working order, but they are so continually stopping whatever they
may be doing to lick one foot or another, like a dog scratching fleas,
that it looks more like an ingrown habit with them than a necessary
act of cleanliness. The fork-tailed katydid is a very unpretentious
singer and has only one note, a high pitched zeep reiterated several
times in succession. But it does not repeat the series continuously
as most other singers do, and its music is likely to be lost to human
ears in the general din from the jazzing bands of crickets. Yet
occasionally its soft zeep, zeep, zeep may be heard from a near-by
bush or from the lower branches of a tree.

Fie. 8.—The oblong-winged katydid, Amblycorypha oblongifolia, male

The notes of other species have been described as 2ikkh, zikk. zikk,
or zeet, zeet, zeet, and some observers have recorded two notes for
the same species. Thus Scudder says that the day notes and thee
night notes of Scudderia curvicauda differ considerably, the day
note being represented by bz7wi, the night note, which is only half as
long as the other, by tchw. (With a little practice the reader should
be able to give a good imitation of this katydid.) Scudder further-
more says that they change from the day note to the night note when
a cloud passes over the sun as they are singing by day.

The genus Amblycorypha includes a group of species having wider
wings than those of the bush katydids._ Most of them are indifferent
singers; but one, the oblong-winged katydid (A. oblongifolia),
found over all the eastern half of the United States and southern
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 419

Canada, is noted for its large size and dignified manners. A male
(fig. 8), kept by the writer one summer in a cage, never once lost
his decorum by the humiliation of confinement. He lived apparently
a natural and contented life, feeding on grape leaves and on ripe
grapes, obtaining the pulp of the latter by gnawing holes through
the skin. He was always sedate, always composed, his motions
always slow and deliberate. In walking he carefully lifted each foot
and brought the leg forward with a steady movement to the new
position, where the foot was carefully set down again. Only in the
act of jumping did he ever make a quick movement of any sort.
But his preparations for the leap were as calm and unhurried as his
other acts: Pointing the head upward, dipping the abdomen slowly
downward, the two long hind legs bending up in a sharp inverted
V on each side of the body, one would think he was deliberately
preparing to sit down on a tack, but all at once a catch seems to be
released somewhere as he suddenly springs upward into the leaves
overhead, at which he had taking such long and careful aim.

For a long time the aristocratic prisoner uttered no sound, but at
last one evening he repeated three times a squeaking note resembling
shriek with the s much aspirated and with a prolonged vibration
on the ze. The next evening he played again, making at first a weak
swish, swish, swish, with the s very sibilant and the 7 very vibratory.
But after giving this as a prelude he began a shrill shrve-e-e-e-k,
shrie-e-e-e-k, repeated about six times, a loud sound described by
Blatchley as a “creaking squawk—like the noise made by drawing
a fine-toothed comb over a taut string.”

The best known members of the round-headed katydids, and per-
haps of the whole family, are the angular-winged katydids (fig. 9).
These are large, maple-leaf green insects, much flattened from side
to side, with the leaflike wings folded high over the back and
abruptly bent on their upper margins, giving the creatures the hump-
backed appearance from which they get their name of angular-
winged katydids. The sloping surface of the back in front of the
hump makes a large flat triangle, plain in the female, but in the
male corrugated and roughened by the veins of the musical apparatus.

There are two species of the angular-winged katydids in the
United States, both belonging to the genus Alicrocentrwm, one dis-
tinguished as the larger angular-winged katydid, M/. rhombifoliwm,
and the other as the smaller angular-winged katydid, J/. retinerve.
The females of the larger species (fig. 9), which is the more common
one, reach a length of 234 inches measured to the tips of the wings.
They lay flat, oval eggs, stuck in rows overlapping like scales along
the surface of some twig or on the edge of a leaf.

These katydids are attracted to lights and may frequently be
found on warm summer nights in the shrubbery about the house,
420 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

or even on the porch and the screen doors. They usually make
their presence known by their soft but high-pitched notes resembling
tzeet uttered in short series, the first notes repeated rapidly, the
others successively more slowly as the tone becomes also less sharp
and piercing. This is the song of the larger species and may be

written. tzeet-tzeet-tzeet-tzeet-tzek-tzek-tzek-tzuk-tzuk, though the
high key and shrill tones of the notes must be imagined. Riley de-
scribes the song as a series of raspings “as of a stiff quill drawn
across a coarse file,” and Allard says the notes “are sharp, snapping
crepitations and sound like the slow snapping of the teeth of a
stiff comb as some object is slowly drawn across it.” He represents
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 421

them thus: tek-ek-ek-eh-eh-ek-ek-ek-ek-ek-ch-tzip. But, however the
song of Microcentrum is to be translated into English, it contains
no suggestion of the notes of his famous cousin, the true katydid.
Yet most people confuse the two species, or, rather, hearing the one
and seeing the other, they draw the obvious conclusion that the
one seen makes the sounds that are heard.

The angular-winged katydids are very gentle and unsuspicious
creatures, allowing themselves to be picked up without any attempt
at escaping. But they are good fliers, and when launched into the
air sail about like miniature airplanes, with their large wings spread
out straight on each side. When at rest they have a comical habit
of leaning over sideways as if their tall, flat forms were top-heavy.

THE TRUE KATYDID

We now come to that artist who bears by right the name of
“katydid,” the insect (fig. 10) known to science as Pterophylla

Fic. 10.—The true katydid, Pterophylla camellifolia, male (one-fourth larger than
natural size)

camellifolia, and to the American public as the greatest of insect
singers. Whether the katydid is really a great musician or not, of
course, depends upon the critic, but of his fame there can be no
question, for his name is a household term as familiar as that of any
of our own great artists, notwithstanding that there is no phono-
graphic record of his music. To be sure, the cicada has more of a
world-wide reputation than the katydid, for he has representatives
in many lands, hut he has not put his song into words the public can
understand. And if simplicity be the test of true art, the song of
the katydid stands the test, for nothing could be simpler than
merely katy-did, or its easy variations, such as katy, katy-she-did
and katy-didn’t.

Yet though the music of the katydid is known by ear or by repu-
tation to almost every native American, but few of us are acquainted
422 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923 .

with the musician himself. This is because he almost invariably -
chooses the tops of the tallest trees for his stage and seldom descends
from it. His lofty platform, moreover, is also his studiq, his home,

INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 423

obtained one specimen, secured in this way on August 12, that lived
till the 18th of October and furnished the following notes:

The physical characters of the captive and some of his attitudes
are shown in Figures 10 and 11. His length is 184 inches from the
forehead to the tips of the folded wings, the front legs are longer
and thicker than in most other members of the family, while the
hind legs are unusually short. ‘The antenne, though, are extremely
long, slender and very delicate filaments, 24% inches in length.
Between the bases of the antennz on the forehead ther is a small
conical projection, a physical character which separates the true
katydid from the round-headed katydids and assigns him to the sub-
family called the Pseudophyllinz, which includes, besides our species,
many others that live mostly in the Tropics. The rear margins of
the wings are evenly rounded and their sides strongly bulged out-
ward as if to cover a very plump body, but the space between them
is mostly empty and probably forms a resonance chamber to give
tone and volume to the sound produced by the stridulating parts.
What might be the katydid’s waistcoat, the part of the body ex-
posed beneath the wings, has a row of prominent buttonlike swell-
ings along the middle which rhythmically heave and sink with each
respiratory movement. All the katydids are deep, abdominal
breathers.

The color of the katydid is plain green, with a conspicuous dark-
brown triangle on the back covering the stridulating area of the
wings. ‘The tips of the mouth parts are yellowish. The eyes are of
a pale transparent green, but each has a dark center that, like the
pupil of a painting, is always fixed upon you from whatever angle
you retreat.

The movements of the captive individual are slow, though in the
open he can run rather rapidly, and when he is in a hurry he often
takes the rather absurd attitude shown at B of Figure 11, with the
head down and the wings and body elevated. He never flies and was
never seen to spread his wings, but when making short leaps the
wings are slightly fluttered. In preparing for a leap, if only one of
a few inches or a foot, he makes very careful preparations, scrutiniz-
ing the proposed landing place long and closely, though perhaps
he sees better in the dark and acts then with more agility. If the
leap is to be made from a horizontal surface he slowly crouches
with the legs drawn together, assuming an attitude more familiar
in a cat; but if the jump is to be from a vertical support he raises
on his long front legs as at C of Figure 11, suggesting a camel
browsing on the leaves of a tree. He sparingly eats leaves of oak
and maple supplied to him in his cage, but appears to prefer fresh
fruit and grapes and relishes bread soaked in water. He drinks
rather less than most Orthopterans.
424 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

When the katydids are singing at night in the woods they appear
to be most wary of disturbance, and often the voice of a person ap-
proaching or a crackle under foot is sufficient to quiet a singer far
overhead. The male in the cage never utters a note until he has been
in darkness and quietness for a considerable time. But when he
seems to be assured of solitude he starts his music, a sound of
tremendous volume in a room, the tones incredibly harsh and rasping
at close range, lacking entirely that melody they acquire with space
and distance. It is only by extreme caution that the performer may
be approached while singing, and even then the brief flash of a light
is usually enough to silence those stentorian notes. Yet occasionally
a glimpse may be had of the musician as he plays, most frequently
standing head downward, the body braced rather stiffly on the legs,
the front wings only slightly elevated, the tips of the hind wings
projecting a little from between
them, the abdomen depressed and
breathing strongly, the long an-
tennal threads waving about in
all directions. Each syllable ap-

stressed, thus producing the sound
so suggestive of ka-ty-did’, ka-ty-
did’, which is repeated regularly
about 60 times a minute on warm
nights. Usually at the start and
often for some time only two
notes are uttered, ka-ty, as if the
player has difficulty in falling
at once into the full swing of
ka-ty-did.

INSECT MUSICIANS—-SNODGRASS 425

its row of extremely coarse rasping ridges. The same vein on the
right wing (B) is much smaller and has no file, but the inner basal
angle of the tympanum is produced into a large lobe bearing a strong
scraper (s) on its margin.

The writer has listened to the katydids out of doors in Massa-
chusetts, Connecticut, Maryland, Virginia, and <Indiana. While
the notes of the Hoosiers are not distinctly recalled, it is very notice-
able that the song of the katydids about Washington is much less
harsh and grating in tone than is that of the New Englanders.
The katydids heard near Amherst, Mass., and near Wallingford,
Conn., uttered always two syllables much more commonly than three,
and the sounds can be represented only as a harsh sqgud-wak’, squa-
wak’, squad-wak’, the second syllable a little longer than the first.
This is not the case with those that say ka-ty. When there are three
syllables the series is sgud-wd-wak’. If all New England katydids
sing thus it is not surprising that some New England writers have
failed to see how the insects ever got the name of “ katydid.” Scud-
der says “their notes have a shocking lack of melody” and he
represents the sound by wr. He attended a katydid concert at
Springfield, Mass., and records that the song is usually of only two
syllables: “ that is,” he says, “ they rasp their fore wings twice rather
than thrice; these two notes are of equal (and extraordinary) em-
phasis, the latter about one-quarter longer than the former; or if
three notes are given, the first and second are alike and a little
shorter than the last.”

The katydids in the vicinity of Washington, D. C., certainly say
“katy-did ” as plainly as any insect could. Of course the sound is
more literally to be represented as ka hi-kak’, accented on the last
syllable. When only two syllables are pronounced they are always
the first two and the couplet sounds quite different from the squawk-
ing sgud-wak’ of the New England katydids. Sometimes an indi-
vidual in a band utters four syllables, “ katy-she-did” or ka ki-ka-
kak’, and again a whole band is heard singing in four notes with
only an occasional singer giving three. It is said that in certain
parts of the South the katydid is called a “ cackle-jack,” a name
which, it must be admitted, is a very literal translation of its notes,
but one lacking in sentiment and unbefitting an artist of such repute.
_ When we listen to insects singing, the question always arises of
why they do it, and we might as well admit that we do not know what
motive impels them. It is probably an instinct with the males to use
their stridulating organs, but in many cases the tones emitted are
clearly modified by the physical or emotional state of the player.
The music seems in some way to be connected with the mating of
the sexes, and the usual idea is that the sounds are attractive to the
females. With many of the crickets, however, the real attraction that
426 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

the male has for the female is a liquid exuded on his back, the song
apparently being a mere advertisement of his wares. In any case
the ecstasies of love and passion ascribed to male insects in con-
nection with their music are probably more fanciful than real. The
subject is an enchanted field where the scientist has most often
weakened and wandered from the narrow path of observed facts,
where he has indulged in a freedom of imagination comparable only
with that of a newspaper reporter chronicling some event of the
daily news. Thus Blatchley, in describing the singing and wooing
of the katydids in Indiana, says:

“One idea alone possessed the minds of the male musicians. That
idea was love passion— that greatest thing in the universe.’ Long
and loud the cymbals sounded, each shuffle, each note, doubtless ac-
companied by the wish that the next would call from the skies, from
the branches above or about them—from anywhere, it mattered not—
one of their form and kind.” The serenade, he further says, “ con-
tinued almost unbroken from dark till dawn. A serenade it was in
truth—a song of love—of passion, poured out in the listening ears
of the other sex. At times a single player dropped out of the
chorus. His work, his love calls had not been in vain. From some
leafy retreat, where she had been hidden by day, a lady katydid
slowly emerged, and, entranced by the song—by, to her ears, the
tender wooing notes—drew nearer and nearer unto the charmed cir-
cle whence the cymbals clanged and shuffled. Their notes became
less vigorous. More softly they fell upon the ear, until finally as
she coyly advanced they ceased and the caresses of antennee took their
place.”

The details in this report are too unconvincing and arouse sus-
picion that much of the very interesting performance took place
in Mr. Blatchley’s imagination as he “listened for hours” that
August night in Indiana to the katydids’ serenade. We must suspect
that the balmy midnight air, a silvery moon perhaps, and the me-
lodious “clang and shuffle” of the eymbals also produced effects,
and that the next morning there were many things interwoven in
the memory of the listener that crept into the pleasing story he re-
counts.

Or also we may read from Riley: “ To the mind of the naturalist,
trained in deciphering nature’s hieroglyphics, the chattering song is
very plainly inspired by love. The male katydid doubtless feels
something of the same satisfaction in playing to his companions,
and especially to Katy, as a prima donna does in singing to an andi-
ence. There is a pleasure in the act which is the outcome of its
being; and the fact that the males are principally the players shows
that the gift is not only a source of pleasure but one of much im-
portance to the species; for the rivalry among the males is as great
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 427

as among higher animals, and a good instrument becomes, in this
light, most important to the individual and to the species. The best
player wins his coveted love, while the feeble and the cripples stand
no chance to impair the vigor of the race.” All such ideas need
to be substantiated by more facts than are at hand at present on
this interesting subject.

THE CONEHEADS

This group of the katydid family contains slender, grasshopper-
like insects that have the forehead produced into a large cone and
the face strongly receding, but which also possess long slender an-
tenne that distinguish them from the true or shorthorn grasshop-
pers. They constitute the subfamily Copiphorine.

Fie. 13.—A conebead grasshopper (Neoconocephalus retusus). Upper, a male; lower, a
female, with extremely long ovipositor

One of the commonest and most widely distributed of the larger
coneheads is the species known as Neoconocephalus ensiger, or the
sword-bearing conehead. It is the female, however, that carries the
sword; and it is not a sword either, but merely the immensely long
egg-laying instrument properly called the ovipositor. The female
conehead shown at B of Figure 13 has a similar organ, though she
belongs to a species called retusus. The two species are very similar
in all respects except for slight differences in the shape of the cone on
the head. They look like slim, sharp-headed grasshoppers, 114 to
184 inches in length, usually bright green in color, though some-
times brown.

The song of ensiger sounds like the noise of a miniature sewing
machine, consisting merely of a long series of one note, tick, tick,
428 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

tick, tick, etc., repeated indefinitely. Scudder says ensiger begins
with a note like b7w, then pauses an instant and immediately emits
a rapid succession of sounds like chwé at the rate of about five per
second and continues them an unlimited time. McNeil represents

the notes as zip, zip, zip; Davis expresses
them as ik, ik, ik; and Allard hears them as
tsip, tsip, tsip. The song of retusus (fig. 13)
is quite different. It consists of a long shrill
whirr which Rehn and Hebberd describe as
a continuous zeeeceeceee. The sound is not
loud but is of a very high key, and rises in
pitch as the player gains speed in his wing
movements, till to some human ears it be-
comes almost inaudible, though to others it
is a plain and distinct screech.

A large conehead and one with a much
stronger instrument is the robust conehead,
Neoconocephalus robustus (fig. 14). He is
one of the loudest singers of American Or-
thoptera, his song being an intense, continu-
ous buzz, somewhat resembling that of a
cicada. A caged specimen singing in a
room makes a deafening noise. The prin-
cipal buzzing sound is accompanied by a
lower, droning hum, the origin of which is
not clear but which is probably some second-
ary vibration of the wings. The player
always sits head downward while perform-
ing, and the breathing motions of the abdo-
men are very deep and rapid. The robust
conehead is an inhabitant of dry sandy
places along the Atlantic coast from Massa-
chusetts to Virginia and, according to
Blatchley, of similar places near the shore
of Lake Michigan in Indiana. The writer
made its acquaintance in Connecticut on the
sandy flats of the Quinnepiac Valley, north
of New Haven, where its shrill song may be
heard on summer nights from long distances.

THE MEADOW GRASSHOPPERS

These are trim, slim little grasshopperlike insects, active by day,
that live in moist meadows where the vegetation is always fresh and
juicy. They constitute the subfamily Conocephaline of the katydid
family, having conical heads like the last group, but being mostly
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 429

of smaller size. There are numerous species of the meadow grass-
hoppers, but most of them in the eastern part of the United States
belong to two genera known as Orchelimum and Conocephalus. The
most abundant and most widely distributed member of the first is
the common meadow grasshopper, Orchelimum vulgare. A male is
shown in Figure 15. He is a little over an inch in length, with head
rather large for his size, and with big eyes of a bright orange color.
The ground color of his body is greenish, but the top of the head
and thoracic shield is occupied by a long triangular dark brown
patch, while the stridulating area of the wings is marked by a brown
spot at each corner. These little grasshoppers readily sing in con-
finement, both in the day and at night. Their music is very un-
pretentious and might easily be lost out of doors, consisting mostly
of a soft, rustling buzz lasting two or three seconds. Often the buzz
is preceded or followed by a series of clicks made by a slower move-
ment of the wings. Frequently the player opens the wings for the
start of the song with a single click, then proceeds with the buzz,

Fig. 15——The common meadow grasshopper, Orchelimum vulgare, a member of the
katydid family

and finally closes with a few slow movements that produce the con-
cluding series of clicks. But very commonly he gives only the buzz
without prelude or staccato ending.

Another common member of the genus is the agile meadow grass-
hopper, Orchelimum agile. Its music is said to be a long zip, zip,
zip, zee-e-e-¢, with the z¢p syllable repeated many times. These two
elements, the zp and the zee, are characteristic of the songs of all
the Orchelimums, some giving more stress to the first and others
to the second, and sometimes either one or the other is omitted.
A very pretty species of the genus is the handsome meadow grass-
hopper, Orchelimum laticauda (or pulchellum) shown in Figure 16.
When at rest both males and females usually sit close to a stem or
leaf with the middle of the body in contact with the support and
the long hind legs stretched out behind. Davis says the song of
this species is a zip, zip, zip, 2, 2, 2, quite distinguishable from that
of O. vulgare.

Still smaller meadow grasshoppers belong to the genus Cono-
cephalus, more commonly called Xiphidiwm. One of the commonest
430 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

species, the slender meadow grasshopper, C’. fasciatus, is shown
in Figure 17. It is less than an inch in length, the body is
green, the back of the thorax dark brown,
the wings reddish-brown, and the back
of the abdomen marked with a_ broad
brown stripe. Allard says the song of
this little meadow grasshopper may be
expressed as tip, tip, tip, tseeeeeccececeec,
but that the entire song is so faint as almost
to escape the hearing. Piers describes
it as plee-e-e-e-e-e-, tzit, tzit, teit, tet.
Like the song of Orchelimum vulgare it
apparently may either begin or end with
staccato notes.

THE SHIELD BEARERS

Another large group of the katydid
family is the subfamily Decticine, mostly
cricketlike insects that live on the ground;
but they have wings so short (fig. 18)
that they are poor musicians and can
claim but passing notice here. They
are called “shield bearers” because the
large back plate of the
first body segment is more
or less prolonged like a
shield over the back. Most
of the species live in the

so abundant as to form
large and very destructive bands. One such
species is the Mormon cricket, Anabrus simplex,
and another is the Coulee cricket, Peranabrus

of the State of Washington. The females of der meadow grass-

Still another large subfamily of the Tettigoniide is the Rhadopho-
rine, including the insects known as camel crickets. But these are
all wingless, and therefore silent.

INSECT MUSICIANS——SNODGRASS 431
THE CRICKET FAMILY

The chirp of the cricket is probably the most familiar note of all
Orthopteran music. But the only cricket commonly known to the
public is the black field cricket, the lively chirper of our yards and
gardens. His European cousin, the house cricket, is famous as the
“cricket on the hearth” on account of his fondness for fireside
warmth which so stimulates him that he must express his animation
in song. This house cricket has been known as Gryllus since the
time of the ancient Greeks and Romans, and his name has been
made the basis for the name of his family, the Gryllide, for there
are numerous other crickets, some that live in trees, some in shrub-
bery, some on the ground, and others in the earth.

Wie. 18.—The Coulee cricket, Peranabrus scabricollis, male and female, an example of
a cricket-like member of the katydid family

The crickets have long slender antenne like those of the katydids,
and also stridulating organs on the bases of the wings, and ears in
their front legs. But they differ from the katydids in having only
three joints in their feet (fig. 4,C). The cricket’s foot in this respect
resembles the foot of the grasshopper (A), but usually differs from
that of the grasshopper in having the basal joint smooth or hairy
all around or with only one pad on the under surface. In most
crickets also the second joint is very small. Some crickets have
large wings, others have small wings, some no wings at all. The
females are provided with long ovipositors for placing their eggs
in twigs of trees or in the ground (figs. 21, 22).

The musical or stridulating organs of the crickets are similar to
those of the katydids, being formed from the veins of the bases of
the front wings. But in the crickets the parts are equally developed
on each wing, and it looks as if the crickets could play with either
wing uppermost. Yet most of them consistently keep the right wing
on top and use the file of this wing and the scraper of the left, just
the reverse of the custom amongst the katydids. Yet there are
exceptions to the rule amongst the crickets. It has been shown by
Lutz that 2 per cent of a large number of individuals of the black
field cricket, Gryllus assimilis, that he examined had the left wing
432 . ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

uppermost. He found also that they keep the wings through life
in whatever position they have at maturity, but that if the wings
are changed artificially at the last molt before they become dry and
stiff the crickets kept them in this altered position and when mature
sing as well as any of the others. Amongst the females a larger
percentage have the left wing normally on top.

The front wings of male crickets are usually very broad and have
the outer edges turned down in a wide flap that folds over the sides
of the body when the wings are closed. The wings of the females
are simpler and usually smaller. The differences between the front

wings in the male and the female of one of the tree crickets (fig. 23)
is shown at B and D of Figure 19. The inner half of the wing (or
the rear half when the wing is extended) is very large in the male
(D) and has only a few veins, which brace or stiffen the wide mem-
branous vibratory area or tympanum. The inner basal part or anal
area of the male wing is also larger than in the female and contains
a prominent vein (Cw,) which makes a sharp curve toward the edge
of the wing. This vein has the stridulating file on its under surface.
The veins in the wing of an adult female (B) are comparatively
simple, and those of a young female cricket (A) are more so. But
the complicated venation of the male wing has been developed from
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 433

the simple type of the female, which is that common to insects in
general, as has been shown by Comstock and Needham. The wing
of a young male (C) is not so different from that of a young female
(A) but that the corresponding veins can be identified, as shown
by the lettering. Going next to the wing of the adult male (D) it
is an easy matter to determine what the veins are that have been
so distorted to produce the stridulating apparatus. As Comstock
says (Introduction to Entomology, p. 85): “It can be easily seen
that the file is on that part of Cu, that is bent back toward the inner
margin of the wing; the tympana are formed between the branches
of cubitus (Cu,, Cu,); and the scraper (s) is formed at the outer
end of the anal area.” When the tree crickets sing they elevate the
wings above the back like two broad fans (figs. 23, 26) and move them
sidewise so that the file of the right rubs over the scraper of the left.

THE MOLE CRICKETS

The mole crickets (fig. 20) are solemn crea-
tures of the earth. They live like true moles
in burrows underground, usually in wet fields
or along streams. Their forefeet are broad and
turned outward for digging like the front feet
of moles. But the mole crickets differ from real
moles in having wings, and sometimes they leave
their burrows at night and fly about, being oc-
casionally attracted to lights. Their front wings
are short and lie flat on the back over the
base of the abdomen, but the long hind wings py¢.. 20._A mole
are folded lengthwise over the back and project ach alaaliae
beyond the tip of the body. .

Notwithstanding the gloomy nature of their habitat the male mole
crickets sing. Their music, however, is solemn and monotonous,
being always a series of loud, deep-toned chirps, like churp, churp,
churp, repeated very regularly about a hundred times a minute and
continued indefinitely if the singer is not disturbed. Since the notes
are most frequently heard coming from a marshy field or from the
edge of a stream, they might be supposed to be those of a small
frog. It is difficult to capture a mole cricket in the act of singing
for he is most likely standing at an opening in his burrow, into
which he retreats before he is discovered.

There are several species of mole crickets in the United States.
The European one, Gryllotalpa gryllotalpa, has been introduced at
a few places in the East. The common American species is Gryllo-
talpa or Neocurtilla hexadactyla (fig. 20), while a larger species,
XN. major, is known from the Middle West.

434 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

THE FIELD CRICKETS

This group of crickets includes Gryllus as its typical member, but
entomologists give first place to a smaller brown cricket called
Nemobius. There are numerous species of the genus, but a widely

distributed one is V. vittatus, the striped ground cricket. This is a
little cricket, about three-eighths of an inch in length, brownish in
color, with three darker stripes on the abdomen, common in fields
and dooryards (fig. 21). In the fall the females lay their eggs in
INSECT MUSICIANS—-SNODGRASS 435

the ground with their slender ovipositors (D, E) and the eggs (F)
hatch the following summer.

The song of the male Nemobius is a continuous twittering trill so
faint that you must listen attentively to hear it. In singing the male
raises his wings at an angle of about 45°. The stridulating vein is
set with such fine ridges that they would seem incapable of produc-
ing even those whispering Nemobius notes. Most of the musical in-
struments of insects can be made to produce a swish, a creak, or a
grating noise of some sort when handled with our clumsy fingers or
with a pair of forceps, but only the skill of the living insect can bring
from them the tones and the volume of sound they are capable of
producing.

We now come to our friend Gryllus, the black cricket (Fig. 22) so
common everywhere in fields and yards and occasionally entering
houses. The true house cricket of Europe, Gryllus domesticus, has
become naturalized in this country and occurs in small numbers
through the Eastern States. But our common native species is G'ryl-
lus assimilis. Entomologists distinguish several varieties, though
they are inclined to regard them all as belonging to the one species.

Mature individuals of Gryllus are particularly abundant in the
fall; in southern New England they appear every year at this season
by the millions, swarming everywhere, hopping across the country
roads in such numbers that it is impossible to ride or walk without
crushing them. Most of the females lay their eggs in September and
October, depositing them singly in the ground (Fig. 22, D, E) in the
same way that Nemobius does. These eggs hatch about the 1st of
June the following year. But at this same time another group of in-
dividuals reaches maturity, a group that hatched in midsummer of
the preceding year and passed the winter in an immature condition.
The males of these begin singing at Washington during the last part
of May, in Connecticut the 1st of June, and may be heard until the
end of June. Then there is seldom any sound of Gryllus until the
middle of August, when the males of the spring group begin to ma-
ture. From now on their notes become more and more common and
by early fall they are to be heard almost continuously day and night
until frost.

The notes of Gryllus are always vivacious, usually cheerful, some:
times angry intone. They are merely chirps and may be known from
all others by a broken or vibratory sound. There is little music in
them but the player has enough conceit to make up for this lack. Two
vigorous males that were kept in a cage together with several females
gave each other little peace. Whenever one began to play his fiddle
the other started up, to the plain disgust oP dis first one, and either
was always greatly annoyed and provoked to. anger if any of the
436 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

females happened to run into him while he was playing. If one male
was fiddling alone and the other approached him, the first dashed
at the intruder with jaws open, increasing the speed of his strokes at

the same time till the notes became almost a shrill whistle. The other
male usually retaliated by playing too, in an apparent attempt to
outfiddle the first. The chirps from both sides now came quicker and

quicker, their pitch mounting higher and higher till each player
reached his limit. Then both would stop and #egin over again.
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 437

Neither male ever inflicted any actual damage on his rival, and in
spite of their savage threats, neither was ever seen really to grasp
any part of the other with his jaws. Either would dash madly
at a female that happened to disturb him while fiddling, but neither
was ever seen to threaten a female with open jaws.

The weather has much influence on the spirits of the males; their
chirps are always loudest and their rivalry keenest when it is bright
and warm. Setting their cage in the sun on cold days always started
the two males at once to singing. Out of doors, though the crickets
sing in all weather and at all hours, variations of their notes in tone
and strength according to the temperature are very noticeable. This
is not due to any effect of humidity on their instruments, for the
two belligerent males kept in the house never had the temper on
cold and gloomy days that characterized their actions and their song
on days that were warm and bright. This, in connection with the
fact that their music is usually aimed at each other in a spirit clearly
suggestive of vindictiveness and anger, is all good evidence that
Gryllus sings to express himself and not to “charm the females.”
‘In fact, it is often hard to feel certain whether he is singing or
swearing. If we could understand the words we might be shocked
at the awful language he is hurling at his rival. However, swearing
is only a form of emotional expression, and singing is another.
Gryllus, like an opera singer, simply expresses a// his emotions in
music, and, whether we can understand the words or not, we under-
stand the sentiment.

At last one of the two caged rivals died; whether from natural
causes or by foul means was never ascertained. He was alive early
on the day of his demise but apparently weak, though still intact.
In the middle of the afternoon, however, he lay on his back, his
hind legs stretched out straight and stiff; only a few movements of
the front legs showed that life was not yet quite extinct. One antenna
was lacking and the upper lip and adjoining parts of the face were
gone, evidently chewed off. But this is not necessarily evidence that
death had followed violence, for in cricketdom violence more com-
monly follows death; that is, cannibalism is substituted for inter-
ment. A few days before, a dead female in the cage had been de-
voured quickly, all but the skull. After the death of the male the
remaining one no longer fiddled so often, nor with the same sharp
challenging tone as before. Yet this could not be attributed to sad-
ness; he had despised his rival and had clearly desired to be rid of
him; his change was due rather to the lack of any special stimulus
for expression.

THE TREE CRICKETS

The unceasing ringing that always rises on summer evenings as
soon as the shadows begin to darken, that shrill melody of sound that
seems to come from nothing but from everywhere out of doors, is
mostly the chorus of the tree crickets, the blend of notes from in-
numerable harpists playing unseen in the darkness. This sound must
be the most familiar of alt insect sounds, but the musicians them-
selves are but little known to the general public. And when one

of them happens to come to the window or into the house and plays
in solo the sound is so surprisingly loud that the player is not sus-
pected of being one of that band whose mingled notes are heard
outside softened by distance and muffled by screens of foliage.

Out of doors the music of an individual cricket is so elusive that
even when you think you have located the exact bush or vine from
which it comes, the notes seem to shift and dodge—surely you think
the player must be under that leaf, but when you approach your ear
to it the sound as certainly comes from another over yonder, but
here you are equally convinced again that it comes from still another
place farther off. Finally, though, it strikes the ear with such in-
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 439

tensity that there can be no mistaking the source of its origin, and
right there in plain sight on a leaf sits a little, delicate, slim-legged,
pale green insect with hazy transparent sails outspread above its
back. But can such an insignificant creature be making such a
deafening sound! It has required very cautious tactics to have ap-
proached thus close without stopping the music, and it needs but
a touch on stem or leaf to make it cease. But now those gauzy
sails that before were a blurred vignette have acquired a definite
outline, and a little more disturbance may cause them to be lowered
and spread flat on the creature’s back. The music will not begin
anew until you have passed a period of silent waiting. Then sud-
denly those lacy films go up, once more their outlines blurr, and that
intense scream again pierces your ear. In short, you are witness-
ing a private performance of the broad-winged tree cricket,
Ocecanthus latipennis.

But if you pay attention to the notes of other singers you will
observe that there is a variety of airs in the medley going on.
Many others are long trills like the one just identified, lasting in-
definitely, but others are softer, purring notes about two seconds
in length, while still others are short beats repeated regularly a
hundred or more times every minute. The last are the notes of the
snowy tree cricket, Oecanthus niveus, so-called on account of his
paleness. He is really green in color, but a green of such a very
pale shade that he looks almost white in the dark. The male (fig.
23) is a little longer than half an inch, his wings are wide and flat,
overlapping when folded on the back, with the edges turned down
against the sides of the body. The female is heavier bodied than
the male, but her wings are narrow and when folded are furled
along the back. She has a long ovipositor for inserting her eggs into
the bark of trees.

The males of the snowy cricket reach maturity and begin to sing
about the middle of July. The singer raises his wings vertically
above the back and vibrates them sideways so rapidly that they are
momentarily blurred with each note. The sound is that treat, treat,
treat, treat already described, repeated regularly, rhythmically, and
monotonously all through the night. At the first of the season there
may be about 125 beats every minute, but later, on hot nights, the
strokes become more rapid and mount to 160 a minute. In the fall
again the rate decreases on cool evenings to perhaps a 100. And
finally, at the end of the season, when the players are benumbed
with cold, the notes become hoarse bleats repeated slowly and ir-
regularly as if produced with pain and difficulty.

The several species of tree crickets belonging to the genus Oecan-
thus are similar in appearance, though the males differ somewhat
in the width of the wings and some species are more or less diffused
440 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

with a brownish color. But on their antenne most species bear dis-
tinctive marks (fig. 24) by which they may be easily identified. The
snowy cricket, for example, has a single oval spot of black on the
under side of each of the two basal antennal joints (fig. 24,C). An-
other, the narrow-winged tree cricket, has a spot on the second joint
and a black J on the first (A, B). A third, the four-spotted cricket
(D), has a dash and dot side by side on each joint- A fourth, the
black-horned or striped tree cricket (E), has two spots on each joint
more or less run together, or sometimes has the whole base of the
antenna blackish, while the color may also spread over the fore
parts of the body and, on some individuals, form stripes along the
back. <A fifth species, the broad-winged (F), has no marks on the
antennee, which are uniformly brownish.

The narrow-winged tree cricket is almost everywhere associated
with the snowy, but its notes are very easily distinguished. They con-

sist of slower, purring sounds usually prolonged about two seconds
and separated by intervals of the same length, but as fall approaches
they become slower and longer. Always they are sad in tone and
sound far off.

The three other common tree crickets, the black-horned or striped
cricket, Oecanthus nigricornis, the four spotted, O. nigricornis quad-
ripunctatus, and the broad-winged, O. latipennis, are all trillers;
that is, their music consists of a long, shrill whirr kept up indefi-
nitely. Of these the broad-winged cricket makes the loudest sound
and the one predominant near Washington. The black-horned is
the common triller farther north, and is particularly a daylight
singer. In Connecticut his shrill note rings everywhere along the
roadsides on warm bright afternoons of September and October as
the player sits on leaf or twig fully exposed to the sun. At this
season also both the snowy and the narrow-winged sing by day, but
usually later in the afternoon and generally from more concealed
places.
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 441

We should naturally like to know why these little creatures are
such persistent singers and of what use their music is to them. Do
the males really sing .to charm and attract the females as is usually
presumed? We do not know; but sometimes as a male sings a
female approaches him from behind, noses about on his back and
soon finds there a deep basin-like cavity situated just behind the
bases of the elevated wings. This basin contains a clear liquid
which the female proceeds to lap up very eagerly as the male re-
mains quiet with wings upraised though he has ceased to play
(fig. 25). We must suspect, then, that in this case the female has
been attracted to the male rather by his confectionery offering than

by his music. The purpose of the latter, therefore, would appear
to be to advertise to the female the whereabouts of the male, who
she knows has sweets to offer, or if the liquid is sour or bitter it is
all the same, the female likes it and comes after it. If, now, this
luring of the female sometimes ends in marriage we may see here
the real reason for the male’s possessing his music-making organs
and his instinct to play them so continuously.

A male cricket with his front wings raised and seen from above
and behind as he might look to a female is shown in Figure 26.
The basin (B) on his back is a deep cavity on the dorsal plate of
the third thoracic segment. Two deeper pits in the bottom are
covered with fringes of long hairs, which Parrott and Fulton say
are glandular. But also a pair of large branching glands (fig.
27, Gl) within the body open just inside the rear lip of the basin,
4492 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

and these glands must furnish the bulk of the liquid that the female

obtains.

There is another kind of tree cricket belonging to another genus,
Neowabia, called the two-spotted tree cricket, V. bipunctata, on ac-

count of two pairs of dark spots on the
wings of the female. This cricket is
larger than any of the species of Oencan-
thus and is of a pinkish-brown color. It
is widely distributed over the eastern half
of the United States, but is compara-
tively rare and seldom met with. Allard
says its notes are low, deep, mellow trills
continued for a few seconds and separated
by short intervals, as are the notes of
the narrow-winged Oecanthus, but that
their tone more resembles that of the

THE BUSH CRICKETS

The bush crickets differ from the other
crickets in having the middle joint in the
foot larger and shaped more like the
third joint in the foot of a katydid (fig.
Amongst the bush crickets there

is one notable singer very common in the neighborhood of Washing-
ton. This is the jumping bush cricket, Ovocharis saltator, who comes

on the stage late in the season, about the
middle of August or shortly after. His
notes are loud, clear, piping chirps with
a rising inflection toward the end, sug-
gestive of the notes of a small tree toad,
and they at once strike the listener as
something new and different in the insect
program. The players, however, are at
first very hard to locate, for they do not
perform continuously—one note seems to
come from here, a second from over there,
and a third from a different angle, so that
it is almost impossible to place any one of
them. But after a week or so the crickets

Fic. 27.—The back of the third

thoracic segment of the

become more numerous and each player more persistent till soon the
notes are the predominant sounds in the nightly concerts, standing
out loud and clear against the whole tree cricket chorus. As Riley
says, this chirp “is so distinctive that when once studied it is never
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 448

Jost amid the louder racket of the katydids and other night
choristers.”

After the 1st of September it is not hard to locate one of the per-
formers, and when discovered with a flash light, he is found to be a
medium-sized, brown, short-legged cricket, built somewhat on the
style of Gryllus but smaller (fig. 28). The male, however, while
singing raises his wings straight up, after the manner of the tree
crickets, and he too carries a basin of liquid on his back much
sought after by the female. In fact the liquid is so attractive to
her that, at least in a cage, she is sometimes so persistent in her
efforts to obtain it that the male is clearly annoyed and tries to
avoid her. One male was observed to say very distinctly by his
actions as he repeatedly tried
to escape the nibbling of a
female, presumably his wife
since she was taken with him
when captured, “I do wish
you would quit pestering me
and let me sing!” MHere is
another piece of evidence sug-
gesting that the male cricket
sings to express his own emo-
tions, whatever they may be,
and not primarily to attract
the female. But if, as in the
case of the tree crickets, his
music tells the female where
she may find her favorite con-
fection and this in turn leads F'¢. 28.—The jumping bush cricket, Oro-

: charis saltator. Male above, female below
to matrimony, when the male
is in the proper mood, it suggests a practical use and a reason for
the stridulating apparatus of the male.

THE CICADA FAMILY

The cicada (fig. 29) needs but little introduction when it is
explained that he is the insect popularly though incorrectly known
as the “locust.” The loud song of those species that come every
year is always a feature of the season’s daytime program from
midsummer till early fall, while the chorus of the 17-year species
is a special event of early summer wherever and whenever a brood
appears.

The ancient Greeks knew the cicada, but called him Tettix.
They appreciated his music to such an extent that they kept him
captive in cages to hear him sing. sop, however, who always
444 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

found the weak spot in everybody’s character, wrote a fable about
the Tettix and the ant in which the Tettix, or cicada, after having
sung all summer, asked a bit of food from the ant when the chill
winds of coming winter struck him unprovided. But the prac-
tical ant replied: “ Well, now you can dance.” This is a very
unjust piece of satire, because the moral is drawn in favor of the
ant. Human musicians have learned their lesson and sign their
contracts with the box-office management in advance. But the whole
story about the cicada and the ant is a very improbable tale, because
the cicada can eat only liquid food and the common ant keeps only
solid provender in his cellar. All the cicadas have a long beak

Fig, 29.—One of the cicadas that are heard every year, Tibicen pruinosa (a little larger
than natural size)

through which they extract sap from the twigs of trees, if they
take any food at all (see pp. 393 to 396 of Smithsonian Report for
1919), and the cicada of the fable would have starved on anything
the ant might have offered.

There are a number of species of cicadas that come every year.
They are known as locusts, harvest flies, and dog-day cicadas, and
are the insects that sit in the trees on warm afternoons and make
those long, shrill sounds so suggestive of hot weather. Some give
a rising and falling tone to their song, like zwing, zwing, zwing,
zwing, others a rattling sound, and still others make just a continuous
whistling buzz. Then there is the 17-year species that appears in
large swarms somewhere every few years. Each individual lives in
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 445

the earth for most of 17 years in immature stages, but there are
many broods and each brood has its emergence year independent of
the others. In the South there is a 13-year race of this same species.
Any large brood of the periodical cicada creates a great disturbance
when it issues and the matured adults begin their daily choruses
in the trees. The first notes are soft purring sounds, generally heard
from individuals sitting low in the bushes, probably those that have
but recently emerged from the ground. The next is a longer note,
characterized by a rougher or burr sound lasting about five seconds,
always with a falling inflection at the end. This song is popularly
known as the “ Pharaoh” note. Finally, when the swarm is collected
in the trees, there is the grand concert of long burr-r-r-r-like notes,
repeated all day and day after day till the middle of June, by which
time the females have deposited the eggs for the next generation, and
the concerts end with the
death of the performers.

% sides of the first abdominal segment

od from that used by any

of the Orthoptera. Just back of the base of each hind wing, in the
position of the ear of the grasshopper, there is an oval membrane
like the head of a drum set into a solid rim of the body wall. In
the periodical cicada the drums are exposed and are easily seen when
the wings are lifted (fig. 30, 7m). In most of the other species they
are covered by a flap of the body wall. The cicada, however, does
not beat his drums; the drum heads are set into vibration by a
pair of great muscles attached to them inside the body (fig. 31, A, B,
TmMcl). Each drum or tympanum (7’m) is ribbed, the number of
ribs varying with different species.

A membrane or thin sheet of any material which produces a sound
by vibrating must have air of equal pressure on both sides of it
and air free to respond to any changes of pressure. The drum head
of the cicada thus could produce no sound if its inner face were in
contact with the viscera or blood of the body cavity, and between
the two tympana there is actually a great air cavity which extends

1454—25——30
446 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

far back into the abdomen (fig. 31, A, Air Sc). Its walls are very
thin and are closely applied to the inner faces of the tympana. The
whole abdomen of the cicada is, therefore, virtually a drum. Besides
the drum heads themselves there are two other pairs of large mem-
branes in the body wall below them, likewise covered internally by
the walls of the airsac. One pair of these membranes is particularly
thin and tense and must act as secondary resounding boards to give
added resonance to the sound produced by the drums. These lower
membranes are concealed above valvelike flaps of the body wall
projecting backward below them, but when the cicada begins to play
his drums he elevates the abdomen a little and thus opens the space

first three abdominal segments; DMcl, VMcl, dorsal and ventral longitudinal muscles;
n, hinge between abdomen and thorax; wu, supporting plate of tympanal muscles

between the membranes and their coverings. At the end of the song
the abdomen drops down again.

It has generally been supposed that the air chamber of the
cicada’s body is a part of the tracheal or respiratory system, cor-
responding with the smaller air sacs of other insects; but a recent
investigator, L. M. Hickernell, claims that it is a part of the ali-
mentary canal. The present writer described and figured it in a
former paper (p. 403, Smithsonian Report for 1919) as a tracheal
air sac receiving its air through the first spiracles or breathing
pores of the abdomen. Since then he has examined other species
and finds these spiracles always opening directly into the sac, as
indicated by the arrows on Figure 31, A. In freshly emerged in-
dividuals of one species the sac is clearly double, being divided
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 447

lengthwise by a medium septum. It is present in the females,
which shows that it is not necessarily an accessory of the sound-pro-
ducing apparatus, though it has become a necessary part of this
organ in the male. If it is a part of the alimentary canal it is dif-
ficult to explain how it is always full of gas, and if this gas does not
communicate with the exterior air, as does the air in an ordinary
musical drum, it is difficult to see why it should not impede the
vibration of the tympana. The anatomy of these parts needs yet
further investigation.

A well-known writer of popular fiction says this of the cicada:
“These wing shields” (meaning the front wings) “are divided
into several sections by the veins that hold the transparent parts
securely, and the outer edge has a stout rim. Using these rims for
the strings, the crisp space for sounding boards, and the femur of
the hind legs for bows, the locust amazed us by not singing at all,
for he fiddled away gayly as he led the insect orchestra.” This is
bad enough, but the paragraph ends thus, “and they even played in
flight. I could not see how they fiew, and fiddled on the wing
shields at the same time, but repeatedly I saw them do it.” An ac-
companying photograph leaves no doubt of the identity of the in-
sect described—it is the 17-year locust or cicada. No particular
harm is done when a scientist makes a mistake and writes something
that is not true, because his works are read by few except other
scientists, and they soon take him to account for his error; but
it is deplorable when a popular writer becomes careless of the facts,
because his or her statements are read by the multitude uneducated
in matters of natural history and are widely accepted as the truth.

THE SUPPOSED HEARING ORGANS OF INSECTS

After seeing how well provided some insects are with sound-pro-
ducing organs, our curiosity is aroused to know what sound-receiv-
ing apparatus they possess. But here at once we are confronted by
that gulf which separates the external from the internal, the
physical from the psychic. If by some magic one of us could be
transformed for a day into an insect and thus be permitted to think
with its brain, feel with its nerves, and perceive with its sense
organs, we should know much more about insect psychology than
we probably ever shall know by our methods of dissection and ex-
perimentation. Insect sense organs are so different from our own
that even an accurate knowledge of their structure gives us no cer-
tain index of their use, and conclusive experiments on their func-
tions are so difficult to devise and so difficult to conduct that there
is yet little unanimity of opinion on any of the senses of insects
except that of sight.
448 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

As to organs of hearing, everyone knows that insects do not have
ears such as ours on the sides of their heads, yet it is surprising
to most people to learn that some of them may have auditory organs
on the sides of the body or in the legs. The grasshopper, for example,

Wig. 32.—The Carolina locust, a grasshopper (Dissosteira carolina), with front wing

has a large cavity on each side of its first abdominal segment which
has a tense eardrumlike membrane or tympanum stretched over its
inner surface (fig. 32, ¢). Air sacs lie against the inside face of the

membrane, which would seem to furnish the proper statical condi-
tion to allow it to vibrate freely with sound waves of the air. At-
tached to the inner surface of the tympanum, moreover, there is a

cellular body (S&) known as Miiller’s organ, which is continuous
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 449

at its outer end with the hypodermis or cellular layer of the body
wall and at its inner end with a nerve (Vv) from one of the ventral
ganglia. The organ consists of a main body and a slender branch.
The former is attached by a wide base to a hollow peglike ingrowth
of the tympanum (Pg), formed by a pit on the external surface

a vacuole (Vac), both traversed by a fiber (Ff) from the sense cell. E, details of an

(A, Pt). The peg is supported by two arms or thickenings of the
tympanum (d,v) that make a wide angle with each other. The
branch of the sense body is attached to a pear-shaped thickening (P)
of the tympanum.

The sense body itself consists of a mass of cells arranged in two
groups (fig. 34, B), one forming the main part of the body connected
with the peg (Py), and the other prolonged into the branch sup-
450 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

ported by the pear-shaped nodule (P) of the tympanum. The cells
directly attached to the peg form a thick outermost layer of large
cells called the cap cells (CCl). Internal to them is a region of
slenderer cells containing minute, brownish, peg-shaped rods known
as the scolopale (Sco). The basal part of the organ consists of a
mass of oval cells called the sense cells (SC7s) because their inner
ends are in direct continuity with fibers of the nerve (Vv). The
branch of the sense body swells at its middle to a spindle-shaped
thickening containing the same elements as the other part, viz. long-

sensory apparatus forms a crest on the outer surface of the inner trachea, each ele-

(Sco), and a sense cell (Scl). Ct, the thick cuticula forming the hard wall of the leg.

cells containing scolopale (Sco) and prolonged basally to the sense
cells.

It is evident that the essential parts of this organ must be the sco-
lopale since they are the only distinctive structures in it. These
rods may be separated from the enveloping cells by gently dissect-
ing and crushing the sense body, and one so isolated is shown at
C of Figure 34. The detail structure of a scolopala and its inclos-
ing cells, as described by Schwabe, is shown at D, E, F, and G.
The scolopale (D, Sco) and a large vacuole (Vac) at its base are
contained in the enveloping cell (#'C7). The vacuole, according to
INSECT MUSICIANS—SNODGRASS 451

Schwabe, contains a transparent liquid, and both vacuole and sco-
lopala are traversed by a fine fiber (/) from the sense cell, which
ends in a dark body occupying the tip of the scolopala (().

Since no two investigators have described the scolopale or their
enveloping cells exactly alike, too much reliance should not be placed
on the details as given by any particular writer; but scolopale in
similar combinations of cells are found widely distributed in special
organs of many insects. The so-called “ear” in the front leg of a
cricket or katydid has a structure essentially the same as that of the
abdominal organ of the grasshopper... There is an oval tympanum
on each side of the tibia near its upper end, and between the two
there are tracheal air tubes apparently giving a balanced air pres-
sure on both surfaces. In the crickets the tympana are exposed on
the surface of the leg; in the katydids they are concealed in pockets
(fig. 85, #’, #') opening by narrow slits on the surface (figs. 6, D, and
35, A,e). On the outer face of the inner trachea of the two between
the tympana there is a long crest, a cellular mass consisting of ex-
ternal cap cells (fig. 85, A, CC7), and of internal enveloping cells
(#Cl) containing short scolopale (Sco) and connected with a series
of sense cells (SCl) that receive branches from a nerve (B, Vw)
lying along the inner edge of the trachea. The scolopale and their
containing cells in this organ decrease in size from above downward,
as shown at B of Figure 35, and this has suggested that they are
sound-receiving organs graded to respond to different notes. There
are other sensory cell groups associated with this structure in the
crickets and katydids which make the tibial organs of these insects
somewhat more complicated than shown in the figure.

The connection of the scolopala-containing cells with eardrumlike
membranes in the Orthoptera is the principal evidence in favor of the
idea that they are auditory organs. But similar structures occur in
other insects that have no vibratory surfaces. In the legs of the
honeybee, as described by McIndoo, and in other Hymenoptera there
are groups of cells containing scolopale. These are connected at one
end with the hypodermis and at the other with a nerve and have the
same essential structure as the tympanal sense body of the grass-
hopper, except for the lack of the tympanum. Likewise some insect
larvee have similar cell structures in the sides of the body segments,
but these are suspended by cords and have received the name of
chordotonal organs.

Experimental evidence of the hearing powers of insects is at pres-
ent very meager, but it would be surprising if insects do not hear the
sounds they themselves produce. Many insects have sense organs in
the second joint of the antenna, which are most highly developed in
452 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

the gnats and mosquitoes, and in these forms have been described
as containing rods similar to the scolopale. Some writers believe
that these are organs of hearing.

Our ignorance or lack of exact knowledge of the senses of insects
in general suggests that the next important line of investigation in
entomology should be in the direction of a study of their psychic
activities, call them tropisms, or what you will. A more intimate
understanding of the senses and perceptive powers of insects: is
important scientifically and practically as leading to a more intel-
ligent development of methods for combating those species that are
inimical to us.
THE GARDENS OF ANCIENT MEXICO?

By ZELIA NUTTALL

[With 4 plates]

As a preliminary to a description of the gardens of ancient Mexico
it should be mentioned here that in the language of the Nahuas are
found names descriptive of different kinds of gardens, a significant
fact from which a prolonged familiarity with horticulture may be
inferred. The name for a garden in general was xochitla, it.=
flower place; a variant being xoxochitla=place of many flowers. A
walled garden was xochitepanyo. The pleasure gardens of the rul-
ing class were designated as xochitecpancalli, lit.=the palace of
flowers. The humble garden of the Indian was and is a xochichinan-
calli, lit.=flower place inclosed by a fence made of cane or reeds.

These words reveal that the native conception of a garden was a
flowery “ hortus inclusus,” which brings the ancient Mexican garden
lovers very close to us. For a knowledge of the lordly pleasances
which delighted their owners at the time of the Conquest we have to
rely upon the descriptions of Spanish eyewitnesses, which, exag-
gerated as they may seem, are fully corroborated by the native his-
torians, and in the case of the Texcocan gardens by archeological
remains. The most detailed description of a native garden is that
written by Cortés in his second letter to the Emperor Charles V, in
1520, in the portion referring to his arrival at Iztapalapa, a town 7
miles distant from Mexico on the shore of the salt lagoon. He
writes: “Its lord or chief has some new houses which, though still
unfinished, are as good as the best in Spain; I mean as large and well
constructed, not only in the stonework but also in the woodwork, and
all arrangements for every kind of household service, all except the
relief work and other rich details which are used in Spanish houses
but are not found here. There are both upper and lower rooms and
very refreshing gardens with many trees and sweet-scented flowers,
bathing places of fresh water, well constructed and having steps
leading down to the bottom. He also has a large orchard near the
house, overlooked by a high terrace with many beautiful corridors
and rooms. Within the orchard is a great square pool of fresh
water, very well constructed, with sides of handsome masonry,
around which runs a walk with a well-laid pavement of tiles, so wide
that four persons can walk abreast on it, and 400 paces square, mak-

ing in all 1,600 paces. On the other side of this promenade toward
the wall of the garden are hedges of lattice work made of cane,
behind which are all sorts of plantations of trees and aromatic

herbs. The pool contains many fish and different kinds of water-
fowmles®ric? anh?

The observant Bernal Diaz, who accompanied Cortés, wrote enthu-
siastically about Iztapalapa as follows:

The garden and orchard are most admirable. I saw and walked about in
them and could not satiate myself sufficiently looking at the many kinds of
trees and enjoying the perfume of each. And there were walks bordered with
the roses of this country and flowers and many fruit trees and flowering
shrubs; also a pool of fresh water. There was another thing worth seeing,
namely, that large canoes could enter into the flower garden from the lagoon
through an entrance they had made of many kinds of stone covered with pol-
ished stucco and painted, which gave one much to think about. * * #*
Again I say that I do not believe that in the whole world there are other
countries known to compare with this one.

It may well be that the gardens of Iztapalapa were in his mind
when, 30 years after the Conquest, he wrote how he and his com-
panions “ had been filled with wonder at what they saw and said to
each other that all seemed to be like the enchantments written about
in Amadis of Gaul * * *, for the things they were seeing never
had been seen, heard, or ever dreamed of.” It is interesting to learn,
through Hernandez, that “ many trees of a kind of cypress had been
raised from seed at Iztapalapa by one of its lords who took infinite
pains to have them cultivated for his enjoyment.”

In a chapter entitled “ Of the gardens in which Montezuma went
for recreation” the scholarly Dr. Cervantes de Salazar, who wrote
his famous and long-lost Chronicle in Mexico in 1565 and derived
his information from the most reliable sources, records as follows:

This great monarch had many pleasances and spacious gardens with paths
and channels for irrigation. These gardens contained only medicinal and aro-
matic herbs, flowers, native roses, and trees with fragrant blossoms, of which
there are many kinds. He ordered his physicians to make experiments with
the medicinal herbs and to employ those best known and tried as remedies in
healing the ills of the lords of his court. These gardens gave great pleasure
to all who visited them on account of the flowers and roses they contained and
of the fragrance they gave forth, especially in the mornings and evenings. It
was well worth seeing with how much art and delicacy a thousand figures of
persons were made by means of leaves and flowers, also the seats, chapels, and
the other constructions which so greatly adorned these places.

In these flower gardens Montezuma did not allow any vegetables or fruit to
be grown, saying that it was not kingly to cultivate plants for utility or profit
in his pleasance. He said that vegetable gardens and orchards were for slaves
or merchants. At the same time he owned such, but they were at a distance,
and he seldom visited them.

Outside the City of Mexico he had houses in extensive groves of trees
surrounded by water so that the game could not escape and he could be cer-
tain of his quarry. In these woods there were fountains, rivers, tanks with
fish, rabbit warrens, steep high rocks among which were stags, fallow deer,
GARDENS OF ANCIENT MEXICO——NUTTALL 455

hares, foxes, wolves, and other similar animals which the Mexican lords
hunted much and very often.

Cervantes de Salazar also gives a description of a hunt that the
Mexican ruler watched from his richly adorned litter which rested
meanwhile on the shoulders of its bearers. It was no doubt thus
that he was often carried from his summer palace at the base of the
hill of Chapultepec, which was surrounded by a grove of beauti-
ful “ahuehuetes” or swamp cypress, past the bas-relief portraits
of himself and his predecessors, carved on the rocks, up a broad,
winding flight of steps to its summit. From this he could com-
mand a panoramic view of incomparable beauty embracing the whole
valley of Mexico with its lakes and the snow-capped volcanoes
beyond. In 1554 Salazar, in his “ Dialogues,” relates that on the
top of the hill Montezuma had cultivated trees as though it were
a garden and that on its steep sides were terraces with other
groves of trees and hanging gardens. He explains the choice of
such a site for the cultivation of ornamental trees and flowers with
the dictum that “Indians preferred hills to plains”; but an im-
portant reason was doubtless that the native gardeners had learnt
from long experience that many plants thrive best among rocks
which not only preserve moisture but also the heat of the sun, which
counteracts the chilliness of the night temperature in this high
altitude. aa

The fact, however, that not only Montezuma but, as we shall see,
the Lord of Texcoco and the Tarascan rulers built their pleasure
gardens on high hills commanding admirable views indicates that
they had a fine taste and a true love of nature in all of its mani-
festations. In this connection it is interesting to recall here that
being a high priest as well as “king,” it was one of Montezuma’s
duties to “arise at midnight to observe the north star and its
wheel” (the revolving circumpolar constellations), also the Plei-
ades and other constellations. From their hill gardens the ancient
astronomer priests and rulers of Mexico no doubt often contem-
plated the heavens, watching for the periodical reappearance of
the planets and particularly of the planet Venus, which was
celebrated by a solemn festival.

There is a deep pathos in the fact that during his captivity
Montezuma several times besought Cortés to give him permission
to visit those of his pleasances which were situated within 1 or 2
leagues of his capital, which naturally included the hill garden of
Chapultepec. The Conqueror wrote to his Emperor that the per-
mission was never denied; that Montezuma went accompanied by a
number of his nobles and lords whom he entertained with banquets
and feasting and that he always returned “very gaily and con-
tentedly ” to the apartment assigned to him by his captor—an asser-
456 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

tion one may be permitted to doubt. Forming a part of Monte-
zuma’s city residence was what Cortés describes as “a house less
handsome than his palace where he had a very beautiful garden,
overlooked by certain balconies or watch towers, the stone facings and —
floorings of which were of jasper, very finely worked * * *.”

We also know that in the temple precincts flowers were cultivated
and that there were “exquisite flower gardens of different kinds
on the upper as well as on the lower stories ” of the houses of those
inhabitants, whom Cortés describes as “vassal lords” and the
“ wealthy citizens” of the capital. At the Pefion, a rocky hill north
of the city where a hot spring wells up, Montezuma had another
pleasance. The orchard he owned near Coyoacan was given later
by Cortés to Dofia Marina, who had acted as interpreter for the
conquerors.

The most wonderful of all Montezuma’s gardens, however, was
the tropical one at Huaxtepec, which he had inherited from his
predecessor and namesake, Montezuma the Elder. The native his-
torians relate that the latter, soon after his accession to power
about 1450, was reminded by his brother of the garden of their
ancestors at Huaxtepec in the tropical region south of the Valley
of Mexico, “where there were rocks with carved effigies of his
forefathers, rocks, fountains, gardens, trees with flowers, and trees
yielding fruit.” He thereupon sent thither his principal overseer,
naméd Pinotetl, with orders to inspect and restore the fountains
and springs, the streams, reservoirs, and irrigation system. Simul-
taneously he dispatched messengers to the tropical coast region
with a request to the Lord of Cuetlaxtla for plants with roots of
the vanilla orchid, of the cacao and magnolia trees, and other valu-
able vegetable products. With foresight he also asked that these be
brought carefully by native gardeners from the same region, capa-
ble of replanting them at the proper season and tending them in
the customary way. On receiving his message the Lord of Cuet-
laxtla immediately gave orders to have a number of all kinds of
plants dug up with their roots inclosed in earth, and with exquisite
courtesy he had these bundles wrapped in beautiful woven mantles
and dispatched to Mexico. The ceremonial observed by the gardeners
who accompanied them before planting the trees, etc., “around the
fountains in the garden” is worth recording here. They fasted
for eight days and, drawing blood from the helix of their ears, they
anointed the plants therewith. Asking Pinotetl for a quantity of
incense, rubber, and paper, they also made a great sacrifice to the
god of flowers, offering him many dead quail after having sprinkled
the plants and the soil around them with their blood. They assured
the people that after observing these ceremonies none of the plants
would be lost and that they would soon bear flowers and fruits.
GARDENS OF ANCIENT MEXICO—NUTTALL 457

Their prediction was fulfilled and before three years had passed
all of their charges blossomed so luxuriantly that the gardeners from
Cuetlaxtla were amazed and said that even in their native soil such
plants never flowered so soon. They concluded therefore that the
Huaxtepec region suited these valuable plants better than their origi-
nal home. It is interesting to learn that “then Montezuma lifted
his hands to heaven and thanked the God of all creation for these
blessings and he and his brothers shed tears of joy at the success of
their experiment. For they esteemed as a special mercy and benefit
bestowed upon them by the Lord of the Heavens, of the Day and
Night, that they could now bequeath to the Mexican people and to all
the inhabitants of the Province of Huaxtepec the joy of possessing the
precious plants they had been obliged to do without until then.”

It was of the Huaxtepec garden that in his letter to Charles V,
dated May 15, 1522, Cortés wrote that “it was the finest, pleasantest,
and largest that ever was seen, having a circumference of 2 leagues.”
Headds: “A very pretty rivulet with high banks ran through it from
one end to the other. For the distance of two shots from a crossbow
there were arbors and refreshing gardens and an infinite number of
different kinds of fruit trees; many herbs and sweet-scented flowers.
It certainly filled one with admiration to see the grandeur and ex-
quisite beauty of this entire orchard.” Other Conquistadores were
equally enthusiastic. In his account of Cortés’s second expedition,
Bernal Diaz wrote: “We went * * * to Huaxtepec where is the
pleasure garden * * * which is the finest I have seen in all my
life. When Cortés and the Treasurer Alderete saw it and promenaded
in it for a while they were filled with admiration and said that even
in Spain they had never seen a finer kind of pleasure garden.”

Bernal Diaz also records that on his expedition to the hot lands
Capt. Gonzalo de Sandoval rested and slept overnight in the Huaxte-
pec orchard and pronounced it to be “the most beautiful he had
seen in New Spain. It contained a greater number of buildings and
many more admirable sights than any other garden. Although he
had not finished exploring all of it, as it was more than a quarter of
a league in length, he considered it certainly to be a pleasure garden
worthy of a great prince.”

The historian Torquemada, quoting from original sources, sup-
plements the foregoing descriptions by the information that besides
groves of trees, rest houses, and gardens full of flowers, fruit, and
game there were also plantations and fountains and “several large
rocks on which were bowers and oratories and observatories, with
the steps leading to them cut in the solid rock.”

Doctor Hernandez, the Spanish physician who visited “the royal
gardens at Huaxtepec” between 1570 and 1577, mentions two valu-
able medicinal trees he had seen there, namely the “ Brazilwood”
(Casalpinia crista), which had been brought thither from Panuco
458 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

on the Gulf of Mexico, and a tree belonging to the Bombacacee,
which was evidently the curious macpalxochitlquauitl, or hand-flower
tree (Chiranthodendron pentadactylon) which has always been
prized by the Mexicans for the uncanny simulacrum of a small red
hand produced by the union at the base of its five protruding stamens,
and for its tonic effect on the heart.

At the present day it shares the popularity of the yoloxochitl, or
heart flower (Z'alauma mexicana) as a sovereign heart remedy, and
both figure in the “ Farmacopea Mexicana” and can be bought in a
dried condition in every market place. The fruit trees which flour-
ished in the famous tropical orchard were probably different kinds
of the ahuacatl = avocado (Persea americana) ; of the tzapotl (Calo-
carpum mammosum) ; the texocotl (Crataegus), a species of medlar
which makes delicious preserves; the xalxocotl = guava; the macaxo-
cot] (Spondias mombin, the “ hog plum”) ; and the capolin (Prunus
capuli). Among the ornamental trees and shrubs were doubtless the
tree now known to botanists as Bombawx ellipticum and other species
of the family; the two poinsettias; the Gynandropsis speciosa; the
fragrant Turpinia insignis; and several acacias, to say nothing of
aralias, yuccas, and tree ferns and palms.

Among the showy flowers were the Tigridias, the bulbs of which
yield a farinaceous food; marigolds (Zagetes) of many kinds, and
various species of the orchid, zinnia, cactus, amaryllis, bouvardia,
solanum, lantana, bromelia, convolvulus, salvia, and dahlia families;
the Hibiscus spiralis, the Solandra guttata with countless creepers;
possibly the tall showy huauhtli (Amaranthus leucocarpus) and the
Chenopodium nuttalliae, the seeds of both of which furnished favorite
foods.

After reading the authentic evidence that has been presented one
can but reecho the conclusion expressed shortly after the Conquest
by Salazar, then residing in Mexico, namely, that “few princes and
perhaps not one ever possessed pleasure gardens that equaled those
of the great lord Montezuma.” From his delightful hill garden at
Chapultepec, commanding one of the most beautiful views of the
world, this flower lover could visit the Iztapalapa pleasance as he
traveled in his litter, by easy stages, to the terrestrial paradise at
Huaxtepec, containing the choicest products of tropical vegetation
in full magnificence and luxuriance, brought together by the un-
remitting efforts of his forefathers and his own. It is pitiful to re-
late that at the present day, with the exception of some grand old
ahuehuetes and the perennial springs of clear water, nothing remains
to testify of the former beauty and grandeur of the first tropical
botanical garden on the American Continent.

Returning to the valley of Mexico, we will now review what has
been written about the gardens at Texcoco, the ancient seat of native
GARDENS OF ANCIENT MEXICO—NUTTALL 459

culture which has been termed “The Athens of America,” and was
the residence of the most interesting personality in the history of
ancient Mexico, whose name would be voiced oftener if it were not
generally considered as so unpronounceable. Nezahualcoyotl, the
law giver, philosopher, and poet king of Texcoco was born in 1403
and died at the age of 71, after a reign of 50 years. Referring the
reader to the works of Prescott and Bancroft for the history of his
life and an account of the remarkable code of laws he formulated,
attention is drawn here only to the interesting fact that, in order to
prevent the destruction of forests and woods he prescribed certain
limits to the hewers of trees and severely punished their transgres-
sion.

A descendent of his, Ixtlilxochitl, relates that Nezahualcoyotl
possessed many kinds of gardens, for he had inherited those which
pertained to the palaces of his grandfather and father and had also
created no less than eight groves and gardens. “These contained
sumptuous palaces beside fountains, canals, drains, tanks, baths, and
other intricate waterworks; and were planted with many strange
and wonderful varieties of flowers and all sorts of trees, brought
thither from remote places. He also had five pieces of land near
the lake where food plants were cultivated and he always personally
superintended their harvest. Each garden was under the special
care of men from one of eight provinces, whose services were ren-
dered as a tribute.” Another tribute consisted of the tropical flowers
required for the use of the palace, which were sent daily from Cuer-
navaca, at that time subjected to Texcoco.

Doctor Hernandez, writing between 1570 and 1577, records that
Nezahualcoyot] had devoted himself to the study of plants and
animals and, being unable to have living specimens of many of
the tropical species, had pictures of them painted from nature
and copied on the walls of his palace. The drawings of exotic
plants were so excellent that the Spanish botanist was able to
make use of them. He also mentions seeing the remains of the
new palaces, gardens, and groves of trees planted by the poet king.

Writing in the middle of the sixteenth century, Friar Motilinia
describes as particularly worth seeing the ruins of Nezahualcoyotl’s
palace “with its inclosed garden containing more than a thousand
very large and very beautiful cedar (cypress) trees”; and a second
palace with “ many gardens and an immense tank or pool, * * *”

In 1850 the American diplomat, Brantz Mayer, in, his work on
Mexico, described the same ancient grove of cypresses, standing in
the level plain northwest of Texcoco as “one of the most remark-
able relics of the princes and people of the Texcocan monarchy,”
and gave the following details: “The grove is formed by double
rows of gigantic cypresses, about 500 in number, arranged in a
460 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

square corresponding with the points of the compass and inclosing
an area of about 10 acres. At the northwestern point of this
quadrangle another double row of lordly cypresses runs westwardly
toward a dyke north of which there is a deep oblong tank neatly
walled and filled with water * * *. Along the raised banks
and beneath the double line of the majestic trees were the walks
and orchards in which Nezahualcoyotl and his courtiers amused
themselves * * *.” In his charming book “ Anahuac,” Prof.
E. B. Tylor, who visited Mexico in 1856, wrote of the grove (then
called the “ Bosque del Contador”): “This is a grand square,
looking toward the cardinal points and composed of ahuehuetes,
grand old deciduous cypresses, ayaa of them 40 feet around and
older than the discovery of America.”

In her book on Mexico, Miss Susan Hale mentions having seen in
1891 “a magnificent grove of lofty ahuehuetes surrounding a large
quadrangle.” At the present day, although their ranks are steidlen
thinned, many of the superb old historical trees exist, furnishing
living proof of the grand scale on which the Texcocan king planned
his pleasure gardens. A sixteenth century map reveals that at that
time not far from the above quadrangle there was another grove
in a large circular inclosure. It may have been in imitation of this
or in accordance with the native mystical ideas associated with the
circle that the king of Atzcapotzalco laid out the beautiful circular
grove of ahuehuetes which still exists, marking the site of another
bygone pleasance.

The most famous of Nezahualcoyotl’s pleasances was that on
the high conical hill named Texcotzinco, which overlooks a pano-
ramic view of exquisite beauty with the Lake of Texcoco, lying
between the verdant plains and the distant mountains beyond it.
Pomar relates that here the king had “many different kinds of
plants of variegated colors and singular odors; not only those that
grow on the spot but also others brought from the Temperate
and Tropical Zones.” Here again archeological remains corroborate
the truth of the native accounts of former splendor, and reveal
how, by means of an ingeniously constructed aqueduct and the
filling in of an intervening ravine by means of a colossal solid con-
struction, an abundance of water was brought from the neighboring
heights, about 3 leagues distant, to a reservoir with walls more than
8 feet high, on the top of the hill, whence it was distributed in all
directions by means of stuccoed channels. In 1850 Brantz Mayer
verified that “the hill of Texcotzinco is connected with another
hill on the east by a tall embankment about 200 feet high, upon
whose level tops, which may be crossed by three persons on horseback
abreast, are the remains of an ancient aqueduct built of baked clay,
the pipes of which are now as perfect as the day they were first laid.”

The hill is approached by a gentle slope from the south. Its
‘north side ends abruptly in a precipice which resembles a high

wall of rose-colored porphyry. On the crest of the hill are the
remains of a small palace and of an edifice with flights of steps
which may have led to the famous nine-storied tower described
by native historians. There are also vestiges of a building with a
well-preserved niche and a platform which may have been an out-
door theater such as those of Tlatelolco and Cholula, described
by Spaniards as being of masonry, 13 feet high and 30 paces
square, on which arches made of flowers and feathers were erected
when performances took place. As during what has been termed
“the Golden Age” of “the Athens of America,” the poet king had
constituted a council of music whose members. held sessions and
bestowed prizes on the best songs and poems, it is obvious that some
suitable stage for the presentation and audition of these must have
been provided.

Extremely well preserved are a large circular bathing tank near
a stone seat with a high sloping back and a small circular fountain
on a platform at the base of a flight of steps, all most skillfully
hewn out of the solid and extremely hard rock.

The most remarkable feature of the ruins consists, however, of a
circular basin carved in an enormous block of porphyry which pro-
jects into space and has been aptly described by the English traveler,
W. Bullock, as “standing out like a martin’s nest from the side of a
house” (see photograph, pl. 3). He also goes on to say: “It is not
only an extraordinary bath, but still more extraordinarily placed.
It is a beautiful basin about 12 feet long by 8 wide, having a well
5 feet by 4 deep in the center, surrounded by a parapet or rim 2 feet
6 inches high with a throne or chair such as is represented in ancient
pictures to have been used by kings. There are steps to descend
into the basin or bath, the whole cut out of the living porphyry rock
with the most mathematical precision and polished in the most beau-
tiful manner.” From the poet king’s throne the view is one of sur-
passing loveliness and includes a view of the City of Mexico 30 miles
distant on the opposite shore of the lake. A descendant of
Nezahualcoyotl tells of a similar reservoir on the hill from which
a stream of water was projected into space and, forming a fine spray,
descended like rain on a garden at the base of the hill filled with all
kinds of fragrant tropical flowers. <A steep flight of steps, now
partly preserved, led from the projecting rock to the base of the hill
which was “surrounded by a garden in which was planted a diver-
sity of trees and scented flowers. It also contained a number of
different kinds of birds beside those the king had in cages brought
from distant places, whose songs were so loud that people could not
hear each other talk.”
462 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

It is recorded that the poet king, who had the gift of friendship,
not only composed an ode on the death of one of his relatives but »
had an inscription carved on the breastwork of the stone steps to
commemorate the hour, day, month, and year in which the news of
the death of the Lord of Huexotzinco, “ whom he loved dearly,”
was brought to him while he was superintending the engineering
work on the hill of Texcotzinco. This inscription in hieroglyphics
and a number of notable statues and bas-reliefs representing the
most important events of the poet king’s life were entirely destroyed
by order of Archbishop Zumarraga. A richly decorated clay spin-
dle whorl adorned with a swastika, which I found on the hill during
my last visit, conjured up visions of the gentle native women who
shared the poet’s life and his enjoyment of his earthly paradise with
its enchanting views, murmuring waters, songs of birds, and all
pervading beauty of color and perfume.

In conclusion, an account of the history and true nature of the
famous chinampas, or “ floating gardens,” must be given in order to
dispel some of the erroneous ideas concerning them which were first
promulgated by the historian Clavijero and have since flourished
with a well-known exuberant vitality of error.

In the “ Cronica Mexicana” of the native historian Tezozomoc,
it is related how at a remote period, after the migratory Nahuas had
left Tula, they went southward and reached Tequixquiac. There
they manufactured beds (for cultivating food plants), giving them
the name of chinamitl. This work signifies literally “an inclosed
bed surrounded by a fence made of cane or stakes.” the name chi-
nampa is therefore composed of the word for inclosure and the affix
pan-pani, which conveys the meaning that the inclosed bed was a
raised one, being “on or above the surface.” It would seem that
these first chinampas were made in a plain, for Tezozomoc makes
special mention of the fact that later, when they reached Xaltocan,
they “made beds in the lagoon and planted seeds of maize, beans,
huauhtli (Amaranthus), squashes, tomatoes, and chile peppers.”

Years later, having reached the valley of Mexico, they selected a
site in the shallow fresh-water lagoon, and under the direction of
their high priest cut sods of the reeds and other grasses growing in
the water and used these to make a foundation for the mud beds they
built up, inside of a staked-off inclosure, by means of layer after
layer of the muddy sediment at the bottom of the lake. It is exactly
in the same way that new chinampas are made nowadays in the
Lake of Xochimilco by the descendants of the ancient agriculturalists
who, on account of their use of such beds, were and are known as
chinampanecas = “chinampa people.”

From time immemorial, however, their oblong raised plots, the size
of which varies between 20 to 100 feet in length and 7 to 40 feet in

GARDENS OF ANCIENT MEXICO—NUTTALL 463

width, have not only been staked off with the thick native cane but
have been surrounded by rows of a species of willow the growth of
which resembles that of a Lombardy poplar. These willows, being
‘constantly pruned, give little or no shade, and their root growth is
phenomenal. With a certain amount of training their interlacing
roots form a sort of basketwork which retains the banks of the
“chinampas,” the age of which can be estimated by their height,
which varies between 2 and 8 feet.

Since the water hyacinth (Z%chhornia crassipes) has been intro-
duced in comparatively recent times, it has been found very useful
in building up the chinampas, being spread in thick layers which
are allowed to partly dry and partly decay and are then covered
with layers of mud. Every year the process of raising the surface
of the bed is repeated in order to counteract the erosion produced
by the torrential rains in the wet season. By means of a canvas
scoop fastened to the crossed end of a pole mud is dredged and cast
upon the beds from the bottom of the innumerable small canals which
lie between the “ chinampas” and have also to be kept in a navigable
condition. The same scoops are used by the Indians standing in
their punts to cast water in the high, narrow “chinampas” when
irrigation is required. The low “chinampas” need no irrigation, but
in the wet season run the risk of inundation.

For countless centuries the inhabitants of the capital have been
almost entirely supplied with vegetables, maize, and flowers by the
industrious “chinampa” gardeners, who manage generally to raise
in a year several different successive crops on their artificial plots
of land.’

The foregoing data will suffice to establish that it is erroneous to
refer to chinampas as “ floating gardens.”

Ancient Mexican history furnishes, however, instances of true
“floating gardens” having actually been made and conveyed from
one place to another. The old native accounts of these repeated by
Spanish and other historians gave rise to the mistaken idea that it
was and is customary for the Mexicans to make and cultivate crops
on movable rafts; a method which the shallowness of the water
would render impracticable, all water traffic in the canals being
carried on by means of punts and small dugout canoes.

In the native chronicles several versions are given of how, during
a period corresponding to A. D. 1350-1400, the King of Atzcapot-
zalco and his confederates permitted the newly arrived Nahuas, or
Mexicans, to establish themselves in the lagoon and to make and

2 An important item of sale is that of young plants of annuals which are raised in a
peculiar way. Inside of a raised rim, on a substratum of decayed vegetation, a layer of
liquid mud, between 6 and 7 inches deep, is poured and allowed to dry partially. Seed-
lings are transplanted and set out at equal distances in this bed. When well rooted and
grown the bed is well watered and divided into equal squares by cutting lines in the mud
with a knife. When half dry each square, with its single plant, whose roots are securely
encased in the mud, is lifted out, the compact neat block being easily handled and packed
and buried in the garden beds, where the plants flourish rapidly.
464 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

cultivate their “chinampas.” They exacted from them, however,
“as a token of gratitude and subjection, a tribute of vegetables, fish,
frogs, and other products of the lagoon.” After some years, angered
because the newcomers had presumed to elect a ruler of their own,
the King of Atzcapotzalco decided to demand an additional tribute,
the rendering of which he thought well-nigh impossible.

His messengers informed the settlers that beside the customary
tribute they were henceforth to furnish, firstly, grown willow and
juniper trees for planting inhis capital as an embellishment.
Secondly, they were to manufacture a raft on top of which they were
to plant all native vegetables and then bring it by water to Atzcap-
otzalco. The chronicle records that the Mexicans were filled with
consternation and grief at so unheard of a demand, but during the
night their tribal god appeared to one of their elders and told him
to be of good cheer for he would lend aid in making the raft. To
the amazement of the King of Atzcapotzalco, who declared the feat
“almost supernatural,” they actually delivered not only the trees but
the floating raft garden full of flourishing food plants and flowers.

Summoning the Mexicans to his palace, he addressed them as fol-
lows: “ Brethren, it appears to me that you are powerful and that
all things are easy to you. It is therefore my wish that in future
when you pay your tribute you are to bring on the raft, among the
growing vegetables, which are to be in perfect condition, a duck and
a heron, each sitting on her eggs. You are to time it so that on ar-
riving here the eggs will hatch. If these conditions are not ful-
filled the penalty will be death.”

Again the tribal god came to the rescue and the extraordinary
tribute was punctually delivered for 50 years, by the end of which
time the Mexicans had become powerful enough to cast off their yoke
and bondage. From the foregoing it is evident that, as another native
historian remarks, the making of “floating gardens” was always
considered “an almost impossible and most laborious performance”
and was entirely exceptional. The memory of the tyranically ex-
acted tribute and its payment has, however, been kept alive through
the intervening centuries, and as a feature of the water pageants and
festivals held on the Viga Canal in viceregal and modern times has
often been a simulacrum of a “ floating garden,” countenance has been
lent to the popular, absurd, idea that the chinampas were also “ float-
ing” and could be towed at will from place to place.

After reading in the preceding pages of the beauty of the vanished
gardens of ancient Mexico, the reader will doubtless share the writer’s
regret that, at the present time, there is no botanical garden in Mexico
or elsewhere containing a representative collection of the wonderful
native flora which furnished so much delight to countless generations
of the earliest American flower garden lovers.

INTRODUCTION

There is one and only one locality in the Union where four States
come together at a common point. That locality is known as Four
Corners, and the four States that adjoin are Colorado, Utah, New
Mexico, and Arizona. It is situated in one of the most instructive
areas, archeologically speaking, in the Union, for taking it as a
center, a circle drawn from it 100 miles in diameter includes some
of the largest and most attractive ruins of pre-Columbian United
States. Four Corners is situated geographically nearest the heart
of that area from which the pueblos sprung, the land of the mythic
Sipapu. The massive pueblos of the Chaco Canyon, the cliff dwell-
ings of the Mesa Verde, and the mysterious habitations of the
Canyon de Tsay (Chelly) are within this region. The adjoining
areas of southwestern Colorado and southeastern Utah are dotted
with most interesting relics of a people that has disappeared, and
almost everywhere one turns are monumental indications of a pre-
Columbian civilization antedating the advent of white men and
reaching back to a time before documentary history began.

The zealous Catholic missionaries, Escalante and Dominguez, the
first explorers of Colorado, passed through this region in 1776, in
their trip from Santa Fe into the untrodden north country, far
west of the present city of Dolores, after crossing the river which
even then bore that name. They knew nothing of the great ruins
on the Mesa Verde, but made a brief reference to one of the ruins
in southwestern Colorado. These mounds remained a century longer
before they were made known to science by Prof. W. H. Holmes and
Mr. W. H. Jackson, members of the Hayden expedition. In 1876
they announced the discovery of towers in the McE]mo and Yellow-
jacket Canyons, and thus opened a new page in our history. At
that time there were few white settlers in this region; the Ute In-
dians were in possession, and towns like Mancos, Cortez, and Dolores
were not settled. Even then the most magnificent of all our cliff
dwellings were unknown. Of those on the Mesa Verde, Cliff Palace

465
466 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

and Spruce-tree House were discovered in 1883, and Sun Temple
was first made known in 1915 and Fire House a few years later.
The settlement of the Montezuma Valley by a white population
revealed many other monuments of the past in this region, not the
least striking of which were towers and great houses along the
McElmo and the tributaries of the Yellowjacket, and finally the
more instructive of these, preserved and protected, were called the
Hovenweep National Monument.

ITINERARY

This monument is at present more or less isolated and difficult
to approach, as the roads are not of the best. Two roads are
available to visit it, one from Dolores, the other from Mancos, Colo.,
by way of Cortez. The Dolores road crosses the Dolores River
shortly after leaving that city and continues westward, following
approximately the old Spanish trail past a modern reservoir,
Siguaro, a large pile of stones marking the oldest described pueblo
of the region. The course of the road is to Dove Creek and Monti-
cello, but at Sandstone post office a branch to the left, known as the
Old Bluff City road, but little used, leads to the reserve called the
Hovenweep Monument. One advantage of this road over another
to the south by way of Cortez is that there are no streams to cross
and no quicksands to endanger the traveler. The distance from Do-
lores is about 45 miles, and that by the McElmo Canyon road a
little longer. The Yellowjacket is a treacherous stream, especially
after rains, and is avoided by wise travelers in the rainy season.
There is no regular hotel on either route, but water is found along
the McE]mo, and a place to sleep at a store called the McElmo post
office. Prosperous farmers are settled along both routes, and the
melons, cantaloupes, and fruit of the McE]mo have a wide reputation.

To the Hovenweep and back is a strenuous trip for one day, but

- it can be made. Should the tourist decide to visit Cannon Ball

Ruin he will find it best to sleep at McEImo post office, where meals
are served.

The road to the Hovenweep Monument through the McElmo
Canyon is more picturesque than that from Dolores. The two
roads have a common terminus, and it is better to go by one route
and return by the other. The McElmo or southern route takes one
from Mancos, Colo., to Cortez, part of the way the same as that
to the Mesa Verde National Park, the branch to which is indicated
by a conspicuous signboard. For several miles the Mesa Verde is
visible on the left and the road climbing the precipitous cliff is
observed very plainly.

THE HOVENWEEP NATIONAL MONUMENT*

On March 2, 1923, the late President Harding issued a proclama-
tion creating a new monument in southwestern Colorado and south-
eastern Utah. Like several others, this reserve was created for the
preservation of its antiquities which, although having the same
general character as those of the adjacent Mesa Verde National
Park, are somewhat different. The special kind of ruins character-
istic of the Hovenweep monument are well preserved towers, similar
to those which are found in the Mesa Verde National Park, and are
most abundant and varied in the country west of that plateau far
into Utah. Archeologically speaking this monument supplements
the Mesa Verde National Park and the structure of its towers and
other buildings explains some of the enigmas of ruins in the park.
As this new reservation was created to preserve its numerous towers,
a brief notice of a few buildings of the same type would be a fitting
introduction to those of the new national monument. Fortunately
the author’s field work during the summer of 1922 renders it possible
to interpret some of the architectural features of the new monu-
ment.

There are several towers on the Mesa Verde that are like those of
the new monument, showing that the prehistoric people of the
Hovenweep resembled those of the Mesa Verde.

Three types of prehistoric towers are found in our Southwest:
(1) Square, circular, or semicircular towers without surrounding
rooms; (2) towers accompanied with basal subterranean ceremonial
rooms or kivas; (3) towers rising from pueblos or cliff dwellings.
The first type of tower is generally mounted on top of a pinnacle of
rock or on the rim of acanyon. The second type is situated on level
ground or earth that allows excavation of basal kivas, and the third

“rises from a pueblo or cliff house in which there are both kivas and
living rooms. The relatively greater abundance of the second type,
or a tower with a basal ceremonial room and no dwellings, would
seem to indicate that the tower was connected with ceremonies, and
if this be true it also seems likely that when associated with a num-
ber of rooms, as in a large ruin like Cliff Palace, it preserved the
same character.

Several theories have been suggested to explain the function of
southwestern towers. They have been regarded as observatories,
forts, bins for the storage of grain, especially corn, and as in-
closures for the performance of religious rites. There are indi-

cations that they were built by an agricultural people, one of the
primal necessities of whom is to determine the time for planting.
This can be obtained by observations of the sun’s rising and setting,
and a tower affords the elevation necessary for that purpose; hence
the theory that southwestern towers were in part used for sun
houses or observatories. A building from which the aboriginal
priests determined calendric events by solar observations very
naturally became a room for sun worship or for the worship of the
power of the sky.

The presence of circular subterranean rooms, which almost always
occur with towers, also indicates religious rites. As the tower may
have been devoted to the worship of father sun or the sky god, in
the underground kiva may have been celebrated the rites of mother
earth. The rooms at the base of the tower in which kivas are em-
bedded, in towers of the third type, indicate habitations and neces-
sary granaries, as well as rooms for ceremonials. In support of
the interpretation that some of these rooms are granaries, we find
rows of vases in which corn is stored still standing in them.

Pipe Shrine House, on Mesa Verde, excavated by the author
during the summer of 1922, presents a good example of the third
type, for in it we have the tower, the sunken kiva, and the rec-
tangular basal rooms. The ceremonial character of this building
is shown not only by the tower and kiva, but also by many shrines
in which formerly stood stone idols of the serpent, the mountain
lion, the mountain sheep, or other objects of worship. On the
northeast corner of the ruin near an inclosure there was found a
stone slab on which the sun was depicted, indicating that this
building may have been used for sun-worship rites, and a coiled
pictograph of a large serpent carved on the south wall likewise
points to this worship. The evidence indicates that this building
was constructed for rites and ceremonies of the sun and earth
deities, and the tower and its accompanying subterranean room in
cliff houses indicate that the ancient priests of Mesa Verde wor-
shipped the two great nature principles, father sky and mother
earth, which dominate the ritual of every agricultural people.

The new reservation, called the Hovenweep? National Monument
(fig. 1), contains several towers in a much better state of preservation
than any in the Mesa Verde, a condition which indicates that they
were constructed later. The ruined castles and towers of this
monument are among the best preserved aboriginal buildings in the

2The name Hovenweep, which has been given to this monument, is taken from the Ute
language and has been translated “‘ Deserted Valley.” It is now applied to a tributary of
the Yellowjacket, but was originally the name of the main canyon.

Southwest. The reservation (fig. 2) includes four groups of ruins,
now called Ruin Canyon, Keeley, Hackberry, and Cajon.

There are 13 ruins in the Ruin Canyon group, over half of which
are towers of the second type, which have kivas at their bases. One
of the largest ruins is in Square Tower Canyon and stands at the
head of the canyon, rising from the very rim. Although sections
of the walls of this building have fallen, the remains of a large semi-

circular house are conspicuous for some distance. This ruin also
has buried kivas surrounded by square or rectangular rooms. In
the midst of walls there formerly rose a conspicuous multichambered
tower, whose foundation is D-shaped, its straight wall measuring 23
and the curved 56 feet. The northeast corner rises 15 feet high, and
the walls of the northwest angle of the ruin are still higher. This
ruin, called Hovenweep House, resembles somewhat Far View House
on the Mesa Verde National Park.
HOVENWEEP NATIONAL MONUMENT—FEWKES 471
HOVENWEEP HOUSE

This building (pl. 1, fig. 1) was a pueblo that stood on the can-
yon rim at the head of Square Tower Canyon. Most of its
walls have now fallen into the canyon and are strewn around on
the mesa, forming an unsightly mound; but there still remain sec-
tions of standing walls of fine masonry rising out of the mound,
which are visible as conspicuous structures as one approaches the
cluster of prehistoric dwellings that compose a part of Hovenweep
House. Under the cliff below it are remains of a very large cliff
dwelling, the walls of which are dilapidated, although still pre-
serving certain architectural features. These walls could be pro-
tected at very small expense and would present a fine type of cliff-
dwellers’ masonry. Near by, below Square Tower, stands another
tower, one of the best examples of this type of building in the
Southwest. It rises from the top of a pinnacle, on a well-preserved
foundation on all four sides. This building has given the name
of Square Tower Canyon to the southern fork of Ruin Canyon.
Although tall, its summit is not high enough to afford a view very
far down the canyon. The north and south forks of Ruin Canyon
are separated from each other by a tongue of land ending in a preci-
pice, on which are remnants of a tower having a magnificent out-
look. This structure presents some of the best masonry in the South-
west. At the base of the precipice, as if guarding its entrance to
Square Tower Canyon from the approach of hostile people, are ruins
5 and 6, which are worthy of’exploration by the archeologist. Ruin 5
stands on a large angular bowlder, with what appears to be an
opening or doorway on the north side. An instructive architectural
feature of tower 5 consists of two parallel walls, apparently char-
acteristic of this small ruin, one on each side of this doorway.

There are situated on the north rim of Ruin Canyon three inter-
esting structures. One of these is known as Unit Type House (pl.
1, fig. 2) from the fact that it consists of a single circular kiva of
well-made masonry around which are arranged six rooms. The
southern wall of this ruin is more or less broken down, and the east-
ern portion also shows signs of destruction, but on the northeast
corner there is a remnant of a room so dilapidated that it can not
well be made out. Ruin 11 is composed of a cluster of small build-
ings, and ruin 13, called Stronghold House (pl. 2, fig. 2), is one
of the most picturesque ruins of the monument. The best ruins in
Ruin Canyon, however, are on the south rim, numbered 8 and 9
on the accompanying map. Number 7, known as Eroded Bowlder
House (pl. 3, fig. 1), is mainly remarkable for its site. Perched
on top of an eroded bowlder, there stands a tower, while the rooms
472 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

are on the northeastern side. The mortar is fresh in the walls of
the latter, and the marks of human hands can readily be seen.
There are one or two places in which a corncob is still found
embedded in the adobe, and indentations of corncobs used by the
plasterers are still visible. At the base of Bowlder House there
are many fallen walls extending down the canyon. Ruin 9 (pl. 2,
fig. 1), the ground plan of which is rectangular, stands about 11
feet high on the south rim of the canyon. A doorway opens in the
middle of its north wall and is so arranged as to make it difficult
to enter. The masonry in ruin 9 is rough, and projecting ends of
rafters indicate that it was formerly two stories high. A short
distance from the foundation is a stone cairn which was once used
as a shrine.

Perhaps the most remarkable ruins in Ruin Canyon are the so-
called Twin Towers (pl. 3, fig. 2), which are so closely approxi-
mated that from certain points they look like one ruin. They are
situated on the south side of the canyon, covering the top of a
rock isolated from the rim of the mesa by a deep cleft. The founda-
tion of the larger of the twins is oval and in the southwest corner
is a doorway; the smaller tower is horseshoe shaped. The arrange-
ment of rooms inside both towers, as shown in the ground plan, is
regular, one wall conforming to the outline of the towers. The
walled-up caves below the bases of these towers are small and ap-
parently used for storage. The Square Tower cluster and a few
smaller ruins near it are designated on, the map by the name Ruin
Canyon Group. These towers are situated in Utah, not far from the
boundary between San Juan County and Montezuma County. There
is no water near this cluster. One or two additional towers may
be seen by following down the canyon, which eventually discharges
its water into the Yellowjacket. i

Most of the walls of the Keeley group of ruins are well preserved.
The cluster is situated about a small canyon and is approached
on foot from Keeley Camp, where there is a constant spring of good
water. Two of the Keeley ruins belong to the tower type and are
built on bowlders.

The largest ruin in this vicinity, called Hackberry Castle, is rec-
tangular in form and stands on the edge of the canyon. There are
rafters in the wall at a level about 12 feet above the base. A second
ruin, a short distance north of Hackberry Castle, also rises from the
rim of the canyon. Its walls are well preserved and the outline of the
base about square, with corners rounded. There are indications that
the entrance to this room was through the floor.

Two other towers in the bottom of the canyon show some of the
finest masonry of this region. Their foundations cover the top of
HOVENWEEP NATIONAL MONUMENT—FEWKES 473

fallen bowlders, which rise to a considerable height. The well-made
doorways are wide above and narrow below. The approach at pres-
ent is difficult on account of the height of the basal rock on which the
ruin stands. There are evidences that the former inhabitants used
foot holes cut in the base in order to enter this building.

The third group of ruins, known as the Hackberry group, has
several well-preserved prehistoric stone buildings. Hackberry Can-
yon is one of the terminal spurs of Bridge Canyon. The main ruin
in this cluster is called, from its ground plan, the Horseshoe House
(pl. 4, fig. 1). It is particularly instructive from the fact that it has
a central circular tower which is for two-thirds of its circumference
concentric with the outer wall, to which it is united by radial parti-
tions. It is situated on the north edge of the canyon, with its straight
wall on the south side. The northeastern corner of Horseshoe House
stands several feet higher than the southeast, which corner rests on -
a projecting rock, reminding one of the cornerstone of Sun Temple.
The masonry of most of the southern segment of the inclosed cir-
cular inner wall has fallen down the cliff. There apparently was no
doorway on this south side, as the line of wall is so near the cliff.
The ruin is not large, the south wall being about 30 feet in length
and the highest wall about 12 feet. A short distance north of Horse-
shoe House there are two large pueblos in a ruined tower rising from
an extensive pueblo whose walls have fallen. At the foot of the
cliff on which Horseshoe House stands is a cliff house with a single
kiva (pl. 4, fig. 2).

The best preserved building in the Hovenweep National Monu-
ment, called Hovenweep Castle (pl. 5, fig. 1), is divided into two
sections, western and southern, imparting to the ground plan of
the ruin the shape of the letter L. It has towers and kivas arranged
about rectangular rooms; and the western end is composed of a
massive-walled semicircular tower and well-preserved rooms with
high walls.

The eastern section, like the western, has a tower and circular
depressions or kivas. On the north and south ends this section rises
into high walls inclosing rectangular rooms, those at the north end
being better constructed, and standing as high as the walls of the
western tower. The corners of these buildings, as is generally the
case, are not well preserved, due to lack of properly tying or bind-
ing the courses of masonry. Much débris has accumulated in and
around the kivas, filling their cavities; it is evident that these cere-
monial rooms were formerly one-storied, and practically are sub-
terranean on account of the height of surrounding rooms. Frag-
ments of standing walls project out of the accumulated débris, indi-
cating rooms at the junction of the eastern and western sections of
474 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

the ruin, but the form and arrangement of walls at that junction
are not evident. The walls of one of the kivas show evidences of
mural pilasters and banquettes like those of cliff dwellings.

The fourth group of ruins in the Hovenweep Monument is situ-
ated at the head of a small canyon on the Cajon Mesa a few miles
west of those already described. 'To the largest ruin of this group,
the author has given the name Cool Spring House (pl. 5, fig. 2), on
account of the fine drinking water in the canyon below it. This ruin
would well repay extensive study and contains features not yet
described in other ruins.‘

POTTERY AND OTHER OBJECTS

Through the kindness of Mr. Williamson, cashier of the national
bank at Dolores, the author is able to give a brief chapter on pot-
tery and other objects from the neighborhood of Hovenweep Na-
tional Monument. In a general way the architecture of the build-
ings in the Hovenweep National Monument is identical with that
of the buildings on top of the Mesa Verde and likewise the build-
ings in the intervening areas separating the two. The large mounds
in the Montezuma Valley west of the Mesa Verde have such
a tlose likeness to those in the Mummy Lake group and elsewhere
on the surface of the Mesa Verde Park that we may suppose their
former buildings identical in culture. Wherever we find true cliff
dwellings in this vast area we have evidence of cultural similarities.
In other words the architectural types of the Mesa are practically
duplications of those in the neighboring valleys, and the conclu-
sion is evident that all this neighborhood was formerly inhabited by
a widespread people in a similar stage of development. The extent
of the distribution of these similarities, north, west, south, and east,
is a most interesting problem for the archeologist to solve, for it
indicates the horizontal spread of a characteristic culture.

But similarity in architectural features is only one means by
which the archeologist recognizes the extension of culture; another
is the similarity in form, colors, and designs of pottery. An exam-
ination of ceramic objects reveals the fact that there is no radical
difference in pottery throughout this area and we find by comparison
that pottery from the Hovenweep National Monument is so similar
to that from the Mesa Verde that one may say it is identical, and
is the product of people in the same cultural stage. The ceramic
evidence thus supports the architectural that the former inhabitants
of the Hovenweep National Monument were the same as those of
the Mesa Verde. But it must be borne in mind that we are handi-
capped by the paucity of specimens from the two regions for com-

68, No. 1, 1917.
HOVENWEEP NATIONAL MONUMENT—FEWKES 475

parative purposes and uncertainty as to the localities from which
individual specimens were taken. We know that the pottery figured
in the following pages came from the valleys adjoining the Mesa
Verde on the west, far enough down the San Juan River to establish
the fact that the area peopled by Indians who made the same pottery
was a large one.

There are only a few collections from the area we are now con-
sidering and nothing of note from the Hovenweep National Mon-
ument, but the author had the good fortune to examine-a few small
collections found in the McEImo and tributary canyons and in the
ruins in Montezuma Valley, the majority of which were found
in the neighborhood of the Hovenweep National Monument and
in mounds situated in Montezuma County. A collection known as
the Williamson collection, gathered in this area, was exhibited for
many years in the First National Bank at Dolores, and through
the kindness of Mr. Williamson the author was able to take pho-
tographs and make a few drawings of the most striking specimens.
There are many relics besides pottery, but the most abundant type
belongs to the ceramic group called black and white or gray ware
with black designs. This ware belongs to the most flourishing
epoch of cliff dwellers. Figures of typical forms are shown in the
following illustrations:

Plate 6, Figures 1 and 2, represent drinking mugs, the former
specimen closely allied to those from the Montezuma Valley and the
Mesa Verde. The essential character of mugs from the Mesa Verde
area, both on the plateau and the valley at its base, is the enlarged
base, which always has a greater diameter than the opening. The
decoration on this mug (pl. 6, fig. 1) is made up of black triangles
arranged in four series and divided into pairs separated by an
encircling band. The handle extends from the lip to the base—a
characteristic design—but in this particular specimen has no deco-
_ration. This mug was found at the source of the McElmo® Canyon,
possibly at the three-walled tower at Mud Creek. Another mug
(pl. 6, fig. 2), in which the diameters of the lip and the base are
about equal, has its surface decorated in two zones separated by an
encircling band. The decorations in these two bands consist of
terraced figures separated by a zigzag white line shown in Plate
6, Figure 2. There were several other mugs in the collection, but
all have the same general character. The remarkable similarity
of. these mugs to those found in the Mesa Verde cliff houses is
strong evidence that the culture of the Indians who lived in the

5A settler calls this the McElmen Canyon, from an old resident of that name,
476 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

cliff houses and in the pueblos or open villages in the plain was
indentical.

Two specimens of jugs made of black and white ware are figured
in Plate 6, Figures 3, 4. ‘These specimens are made of rough ware
ornamented by the simplest geometrical patterns; one of these has
simply encircling black bands. The handle arises above the neck
and continues to the middle of the jug. These objects are flattened
at the base, but otherwise similar to those from the Mesa Verde
region so often described.

Plate 6, Figures 5 and 6, and Plate 7, Figure 2, show globular vases
with small mouth openings. They belong to the group of white or
gray ware decorated with black designs. The two lugs suggest that
these objects are canteens, having at the base of the neck two knobs
or mounted disks which no doubt served for the adjustment, to which
were attached strings by means of which they could be carried over
the shoulder. The two figures represent the same canteen from
different sides.

One of the most remarkable globular jugs (pl. 7, fig. 1) in the
Williamson collection is four-lobed at the base and decorated with
hatchure and circles each with a central black spot. The handle of
this jug is marked with parallel black lines.

There is in the Williamson collection an effigy bow] in the form of
a bird, here shown (pl. 7, figs. 3 and 4) from side and top. One
interesting feature brought out in this effigy bowl is the T-shaped
opening on the back and the striated representation of the wings.

Another type, approaching in form the bird effigy already con-
sidered, is a clipper-shaped vessel shown in Plate 7, Figure 5, which
has no indication of a head or wings but should be classified near the
bird effigies.

Plate 7, Figure 7, represents a duck-shaped effigy vase with lateral
ridges indicating the position of wings. The handle has been broken.
This object is made of rough ware, unornamented.

In 1922 the author found at Pipe Shrine House, in the Mesa Verde
National Park, a similar bird effigy to that figured in Plate 7, Figures
3 and 4, which also has a well-made head and a T-shaped opening in
the back.

An exceptional form of ceramic ware which was found at the
crossing of the river at Dolores is shown in Plate 7, Figure 6. This
object is a globular, undecorated vessel, unlike any form that has
thus far been recorded from the Mesa Verde.

Plate 7, Figures 8 and 9, represents a clay specimen of three cups
united. It belongs to the gray ware; the bottoms of all are flat;
sides rounded.
HOVENWEEP NATIONAL MONUMENT—FEWKES 477

The remarkable triangular vase shown in Plate 8, Figure 7, has
two extensions, one on each side of the terminal opening. The sur-
face of this strange form, whose use is unknown, is decorated with
parallel lines arranged symmetrically.

Among the modern Hopi the feather plays such an important
part in their ceremonial system that it is customary for every priest
to have a box for feathers, which in old times was made of a root
of the cottonwood. The object (pl. 8, figs. 2 and 4) indicates that the
ancients of the Montezuma Valley also had a feather box of similar
shape but made of clay. Although this receptacle is much smaller
than the feather box of the modern Hopi, it served an identical
purpose.

Food basins (pl. 8, figs. 5 and 6) in the Williamson collection from
the area in which Hovenweep Monument is situated are very rudely
decorated with geometrical figures and mainly belong to the black
and white ware. They resemble those of the Mesa Verde National
Park. Plate 8, Figure 6, has the rim decorated.

Thus far very few fetishes have been found in the Mesa Verde
region, but two good specimens from the valley are shown in Plate
8, Figures 1 and 3, side and front views. These objects are made
of marble and are perforated, suggesting that they were worn on
the person as pendants of necklaces or other ornaments. It is
possible that they were used as fetishes for aid in hunting, much as
the Pueblos employ similar figurines at the present day.

The most exceptional form of pottery is shown in Plate 9, Fig-
ures 1 and 2. This is a double vase consisting of two almost globu-
lar vessels united by a rude effigy of an unknown animal. This
twin vessel is made of white ware with a simple geometrical decora-
tion in black. It was evidently a ceremonial object in which pos-
sibly sacred water was carried.

CONCLUSIONS

It is almost impossible to traverse the country surrounding the
Hovenweep Monument without observing mounds and other rem-
nants of the former housebuilders. The remarkable similarity of
these remains is everywhere apparent. It is unnecessary to exca-
vate any considerable number of these mounds to prove the identity
of the builders. Neither is it desirable or necessary to reserve the
extensive tracts of land upon which they stand to preserve the type
of buildings characteristic of the extensive culture area to which
they belong. The Hovenweep National Monument contains build-
ings typical of an extended area in southwestern Colorado, south-
eastern Utah, New Mexico, and Arizona. Similar buildings of the
same type are found as far north as the Dinosaur beds of Utah and

1454—25 32

478 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

follow down the San Juan to an indefinite horizon. In the south the
culture they represent merges into the Chaco Canyon region and
that of the pueblos on the Rio Grande.

The relationship of Hovenweep buildings to those on the Mesa
Verde is practically identical, but there are forms of buildings
in the Hovenweep country which have not yet been found on the
Mesa Verde. The massive character of the walls of several typical
buildings of the Hovenweep suggests solidity and construction
necessary for defense, and these buildings are ordinarily situated
on the edges of great canyons and may have been so placed to se-
cure distance views down the canyons or extensive vistas over the
waterless plains. Plate 10 shows a tower on a projecting rock which
has fallen and probably buried a cave dwelling. The masonry of the
great houses is the most massive of all those made by the inhabitants
of the San Juan drainage. In addition to this feature, attention
may be called to the predominance of the tower element, which is
likewise a Mesa Verde characteristic. They are condensed in form,
not spread over a large area. The closest of the Hovenweep like-
nesses to the Mesa Verde buildings is the ceremonial rooms known
as kivas, which are seen in Unit Type House, wherein we have a
single central circular room surrounded by square rooms, very
similar to the One Clan House near the road from Mancos to Spruce-
tree House. The terraced form of building so common among mod-
ern pueblos and so well illustrated in Far View House on the Mesa
Verde has not thus far been made out clearly in pueblos of the
Hovenweep Monument, nor do we find clusters of disjoined small
buildings indicating a pueblo in process of formation so common
in Hovenweep Monument as at Mesa Verde. This indicates to the
writer’s mind that the unconsolidated units of the Mesa Verde
pueblos are older than the more closely amalgamated pueblos of the
Hovenweep or the still more compact Chaco pueblos. It is apparent,
as no evidence of white habitation has been found, that all are strictly
pre-Columbian buildings; and their fine preservation would indicate
that they are more modern than the mounds which conceal similar
buildings on the Mesa Verde.

As we go west from Hovenweep there is a gradual change in archi-
tectural types and a corresponding change in relative age of the monu-
mental remains. While stone houses whose walls are not very unlike
those of the Hovenweep occur in this far western region, there is an
older appearance to the ruins and a closer affinity to a prepuebloan
type which on the Mesa Verde underlies the puebloan. In the Hoven-
weep Monument there are evidences of two epochs of culture, an early
earth lodge or pit dwelling culture and a later epoch, the buildings of
which were constructed upon the more ancient. This underlying
HOVENWEEP NATIONAL MONUMENT—FEWKES 479

prepuebloan culture, generally extinct or submerged by a new influx
of pueblo buildings, may have been an early stage in the evolution or
a local development. The later or pueblo form, being more complex,
varies more in different regions, although derived from an almost
identical prepuebloan type. It is not possible from our limited
knowledge to make any final statement regarding the age of these
two types of culture or the causes that led to the final abandonment
of these buildings. The same reasons that have been advanced for
the desertion of the Mesa Verde habitations are no doubt valid for
those of the Hovenweep; migrations due to pressure produced by in-
roads of hostiles; desire for better farms and more water; changes of
climate, perhaps; even growth of local feuds among different settle-
ments, due to congestion of population, may have contributed to the
migration of the Hovenweep people. The traces of direction of mi-
gration shown by the distribution of buildings suggest a southern
migration or toward the sun, where farming conditions were more
favorable and inroads of hostile people less frequent. Legends cur-
rent among the pueblos support this conclusion. The population of
this region was fairly large, or at any rate the size of the houses,
with a few notable exceptions, indicate this. The people could not
have had very extensive knowledge of where they were going, and
there is no evidence of their possessing beasts of burden or other
modes’ of transportation over long distances. Their struggle for
physical existence was fierce, their migratory movement slow, and the
evidences are that they harvested fairly good crops for a limited time
as they spread over the country. The desire to improve their condi-
tion was intensified by the growth of population. Of necessity they
sought the river valleys where water was constant and always avail-
able, and those unoccupied fields that were fertile were more extensive
than any that could be found in a rocky environment.

Absolutely nothing of the speech of these people is known with
certainty. Their language may have been assimilated with some
pueblo stock to the south, but with which group we have no means
of knowing. Not a single one of their place names survives, so far
as researches have gone. No systematic study of somatological data
is available to teach the affinities of these people. Their age is un-
known and the explanation of why they left their homes is merged
into the general history of the conquests of sedentary people in our
Southwest and that of our more vigorous incoming tribes. The
Tanoan Indians have several place names, which are mentioned by
Harrington and others.

The most important conclusions arrived at by a comparative
study of architecture and material culture is that the Hovenweep
people were of the same race as those that built the great houses and
480 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

towers of the Mesa Verde. Within the area in which lie these two
Government reservations we find evidences of two distinct modes
of life; a simple one in which there was one clan in one house, and
another in which multiple clans inhabited one or more united houses;
the one an earth-lodge people, the other a pueblo people. The
pueblo phase of house construction was of local growth; the earth
lodge, having a wider distribution, would appear to have been ante-
cedent to this local differentiation into multiroom pueblos, and hence
is called the prepuebloan, but is supposed to survive in so far as
architecture goes among nonpueblo tribes like the Navajos in the
pueblo area.

The Hovenweep National Monument thus gives us an example of
typical prehistoric stone buildings situated west of the Mesa Verde
having an allied culture, but showing certain variations that are
significant. None of the towers shows any signs of having been
made or used by the white man.

THE ORIGIN AND ANTIQUITY OF THE AMERICAN
INDIAN?

By ALes HrbpricKa

[With 17 plates]

The great problem of American prehistory is that of the
genesis of the Indians, who when first seen by white men were al-
ready spread over the entire American continent as well as all its
habitable islands.

Without discussing the many older speculations on the subject,
we will approach directly the several concrete questions into which
this problem resolves itself. The foremost of these is that of the
race unity or plurality of the Indians.

It is known that the aboriginal population of America was divided _
into many tribes, and even a number of what might be called nations,
often hostile to one another ; we have learned that there were many dif-
ferent languages and dialects, remarkable differences in culture and
the material results of culture, and also marked differences in the
physiognomy, color, stature, head form, details of physique, and in
the general behavior of the different groups of Indians—all of which
would seem to indicate that there might have existed here some, if not
considerable, racial diversity.

But if these matters are subjected to careful and comprehensive
scrutiny, we find that the various differences presented by the In-
dians are often more apparent than real; that actual and important
differences are in no case of sufficient weight to permit of any radical
dissociation on that basis; and that the more substantial differences
which exist between the tribes are everywhere underlaid by funda-
mental similarities and identities that outweigh them and that speak
strongly not only against any plurality of race on the American con-
tinent, taking the term race in its fullest meaning, but for the general
original unity of the Indians.

We thus see that the American languages, while not infrequently
differing greatly in phonetics, vocabulary, and even structure, be-
long nevertheless to one fundamental large class—the polysyn-
thetic—and present other important resemblances in their com-

of the American Indian,” Proc. XIX Intern. Cong. Americanists, Washington, 1917,

482 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

plexity of grammar, ideas of gender, formation of numerals, modes
of plurality, formation and réle of prefixes and suffixes, relative
values of the pronoun, dialectic differences in the two sexes, etc.,
which, taken together, speak for one and the same (though doubt-
less ancient and probably extra-American) broad parentage.

In a similar way we find that, notwithstanding numerous more
or less pronounced local differences in detail, there are in all tribes
many deep-seated and significant evidences of a similar culture.
They exist in the stone, clay, wood, and bone technique; in weaving
and basketry; in methods of housing, of fire making; in clothing
and the limited household furniture; in agriculture; in games; in
all that relates to medicine, religion, conceptions of nature; in folk-
lore; in social organizations; in the usages of war; and in still other
important and intimate phases of Indian life.

Going still further, there are found essential resemblances in the
mind and behavior of the Indians throughout the two continents.
One who has become well acquainted with the mentality of the
natives in any region of either North America or South America,
will find, on eliminating the local environmental peculiarities,
faithful counterparts in all other regions; and the behavior of the
Indian is in substance much the same everywhere in his family and
tribal relations, in the care of the young, in all his functions, in his
ceremonies, songs, warfare, in his peculiarities.

The constitution of the Indian, using the term in its modern
medical sense, is also much the same throughout the two continents.
He is everywhere readily affected by, and falls an easy prey to alcohol;
he is physically enduring, without in general being actually exception-
ally strong; he is little if at all, subject to various degenerating and
constitutional diseases such as cretinism, rachitis, cancer, insanity,
etc., but is everywhere readily affected by tuberculosis, trachoma,
measles, smallpox, and syphilis.

Last, but not least, there are, notwithstanding certain differences,
the basic resemblances and identities of his body and skeleton.
Some of these features are:

1. The Indian’s color differs, according to localities and habits,
from dusky yellowish, or brownish yellow, through all shades of
brown, to that of solid chocolate; but the fundamental color is
moderate brown, or yellowish-brown.

2. The hair, as a rule, is black (to reddish-black after exposure) ;
it ranges about to above medium in coarseness, being never fine;
and it is straight, except in the old or unkept, where there may
be slight irregular waviness, and in the men who wear longer hair,
where the ends may show some tendency to turn upward or wave.

The beard is more or less scanty, on the sides of the face completely
absent, and never long. On the body there is usually no visible
hair except perhaps a little in the axille, with more on the pubis,
though even there it is frequently sparse.

3. The Indian is free from special characteristic odor appreciable
tothe white man. His normal heart-beat is slow. His other physio-
logical functions are everywhere much alike. The size of the head
and of the brain cavity, though differing considerably in individuals
and with the mean stature, averages on the whole slightly less
than that of white men and women of similar height. The skull is
in general slightly thicker and presents many features of the base,
etc., that are of the same class all over the continent.

4. Indians’ eyes, as a rule, are above medium to dark brown in
color, with decidedly bluish conjunctiva in younger children, pearly
white in older subjects, dirty-yellowish in adults; and the eye slits
show a prevailing tendency, more or less noticeable in different
tribes, to a slight or moderate upward slant; that is, the external
canthi are frequently more or less appreciably higher than the
internal.

5. The nasal bridge is only moderately to fairly well arched;
the nose is frequently strongly developed in the males and often
convex (“aquiline”) in shape, but is lower, shorter, and more
commonly straight or even concave in the females. It is never very
high nor so fine or slender as in whites, nor again so flat and thick and
broad as in the negro; and its relative proportions in the living as
well as in the skull (barring individual and some localized ex-
ceptions) are prevalently medium or mesorhinic. The malar regions
are, as a rule, rather large or prominent. The suborbital or canine
forse are in general more shallow than in whites. AIl of which is
true throughout the tribes.

6. The mouth is generally fairly large to large, and the same may
be said of the palate. The lips average from medium to somewhat
fuller than in whites, are never thin (except after loss of front teeth
and after alveolar absorption), and never so thick as in the negro;
and the lower facial region shows in general a medium degree of
prognathism, standing, like the relative proportions of the nose and
many other features, about midway between those in the whites and
those characteristic of the negroes, though on the whole rather closer
to the white. The chin is well developed, but on the average some-
what more voluminous and less prominent than in whites, and is not
seldom square. The entire lower jaw is on the average somewhat
larger than in whites. The teeth are from medium to above medium
size when compared with those of primitive man in general, but per-
ceptibly larger when contrasted with those of the cultured white
484 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

American or European; the upper incisors of the Indian present
throughout, with infrequent individual exceptions, an especially im-
portant feature: They are on the inside, or lingually, characteris-
tically shovel-shaped, that is, deeply and peculiarly concave, with a
marked border surrounding the concavity.” The ears are rather large.

7. The neck, as a rule, is of only medium length and never thin in
health; the chest is mostly somewhat deeper than in average whites;
the breasts of the women are of medium size to somewhat above
medium, and often more or less conical in form, the true hemispheri-
cal type being a rarity. In the females, the éisproportion. between
the pelvic region and the shoulders is less marked than in American
whites. There is an absence of steatopygy; the lumbar curve is
moderate. The lower limbs are somewhat less shapely and generally
less full than in whites; the calf in the majority is rather slender,
more so than in the average whites or negroes.

8. The hands and feet, as a rule, are of relatively moderate di-
mensions, and what is among the most important distinguishing fea-
tures of the Indian, the relative proportions of his forearms to arms
and those of the distal parts of the lower lhmbs to the proximal
(or, in the skeleton, the radio-humeral and tibio-femoral indices),
are in general throughout the two parts of the continent of similar
average value, which differs from that of both the whites and the
negroes, standing again more or less in an intermediary position.

9. In the Indian skeleton, from Canada to Tierra del Fuego, be-
sides the characteristics hitherto mentioned, point after point of
important resemblance or identity are met with which mark une-
quivocally the many distinct tribes as descendants of one and the
same older group of humanity or ancestral stock, and serve to dis-
tinguish them from other peoples except those with which they have
a common prehistoric origin. Such features include, besides those
relating to the skull, such highly distinctive traits as general platy-
brachy in the humerus, frequent platymery in the femur, and fre-
quent platycnemy in the tibia; high frequency of perforation of
the septum in the humerus; great rarity of the supracondyloid
process in any form; and many other conditions. There are tribal
or local differences in these respects, but on the whole the similarity
of the skeletal parts throughout the continent is such that a classifica-
tion of the Indians into more than one original race is quite im-
possible.

- Taking all the above facts into consideration, and remembering
that whatever differences are observable in the Indians in any di-
rection are equaled if not exceeded in other large fundamental

* See “ Shovel-Shaped Teeth.” Am. Jour. Phys. Anthrop., Washington, 1920, III, No. 4.

ORIGIN OF AMERICAN INDIAN—HRDLICKA 485

groups of humanity, such as the whites, the Asiatic yellow-browns,
and others, there appears the possibility of only one conclusion,
which is that the Indians throughout the American continent repre-
sent but one strain of humanity, one main race; and that the varia-
tions observable in the great group are intraracial fluctuations and
developments, of more or less remote, frequently perhaps of pre-
American, origin. These variations in some instances may constitute
types or subraces, but they go no further, for even in such more
specialized strains the majority of the physical as well as the physi-
ological characteristics remain still intimately connected with those
of the remainder of the Indians.

Having thus reached the important conclusion of the fundamental
unity of the American race, we may now approach the second great
question regarding the American aborigines; namely, the antiquity
of the race on this continent.

The solution of this part of the problem may be approached in
two ways: (@) By critical reasoning; and (0) through material
evidence.

(a) Can the Indian possibly be regarded as a true autocthon of
America? In other words, could he have evolved from lower forms
on this continent? There have been those (and they included men
of science such as Morton and, more recently, Ameghino) who were
inclined to adopt or who actually proclaimed this view. But in the
present state of our knowledge it is easy enough to dispose of this
hypothesis. The anthropologist of to-day knows definitely that man
evolved from the nearer Primates; there is abundant material evi-
dence to that effect, regardless of other considerations. These Pri-
mates must naturally have approached man in all important respects,
a condition that could be realized only by the most advanced anthro-
poid apes; but the existence of such forms in America is very doubt-
ful. There were on this continent Eocene and Oligocene lemurs
and other primitive forms, and ultimately the ordinary American
monkeys, but nothing so far as known of any advanced type that
could possibly be included in the more proximate ancestry of man,
unless it was the recently described (Osborn, Gregory *) Hesperopi-
thecus, which, however, is still represented by an imperfect and badly
worn tooth, with another specimen in still worse condition, the
identification of which as teeth of a higher anthropoid it is difficult
to accept as conclusive. These facts alone suffice to render an Ameri-
can origin of the Indian extremely improbable.

486 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

But there are other logical and decisive proofs that such origin
was impossible. The two main are as follows:

1. ‘The Indians, notwithstanding their diverse special character-
istics, are on the whole exceedingly like the rest of mankind in every
important feature, so that if we should accept the view that they
originated in America we would practically be obliged to conclude
that all mankind originated here—a theory that has actually been
advocated but which at the present time would probably seem mon-
strous even to those who would otherwise be disposed to believe in
an American origin of the Indians. For it is well known that all the
really known Primate species that come or ever came near to man
live or lived in parts of the Old World, and that the earliest known
forms of humanity belong equally to the Old World. It is to the
warmer regions of the Old World that the best scientific evidence
leads us to look for man’s origin, and the rest of the earth could have
been peopled only through the gradual dispersion of mankind, or of a
form that eventually led to mankind, from the Old World center or
centers of development.

2. Secondly, we know that a very early and physically as well as
_ culturally very primitive form of humanity had reached the central
part of western Kurope somewhere before, probably much before, the
middle of the Quaternary or Glacial Epoch, and we would look in
vain for any feasible mode of bringing such primitive beings at that
time from America to what is now southwestern Germany, Belgium,
France, Spain, and England.

All these reasonings, nevertheless, would perforce be subverted if,
as has happened so frequently within the last few decades in Europe,
there were discovered on the American continent unquestionable
skeletal or cultural remains of geologically ancient man. As might
be expected from the great interest in such remains aroused by the
European discoveries, with human credulity and especially the gen-
eral inclination of less disciplined or trained minds toward the won-
derful, with its dwarfs, giants, and beings of mysterious power or of
great antiquity, and also as a result the many possibilities of acci-
dental inclusion of human artifacts or remains in old strata, the
occasional rapid fossilization of human bones, and a possible com-
mingling of such bones or other vestiges of man with the bones of
ancient animals—claims to discoveries of skeletal or other remains
of early American man have not been wanting and will not be want-
ing as time goes on. Announcements of such discoveries have ap-
peared repeatedly both in North America and in South America,
and have given rise to much speculation. On being subjected to
thorough scientific scrutiny, however, the antiquity of the majority
of the finds on which the structure of man’s antiquity in America

was or is to be reared vanish as evidence, and the residue is supported
by testimony so indecisive that no conclusion of geological age of
the remains can legitimately be based thereon.* Impartially weighed,
the probabilities are in every instance against rather than for geo-
logic antiquity. So far, then, the subject may be summarized by the
statement that, while we now possess numerous and in seme instances
great anthropological collections from this continent, and while
many old caves, rock shelters, and other sites, some of which have
yielded remains of Quarternary or earlier animals, have been care-
fully explored, there is to this day not a single American human
bone in existence or on record the geological antiquity of which can
be demonstrated beyond doubt. It is in fact impossible for us to
produce, though they might reasonably be expected, any specimens
that can demonstrably compare in antiquity with the remains of, for
instance, the predynastic Egyptians, unless it is the most recently
found but not yet definitely determined bones of Los Angeles.’

As the question stands, therefore, even if we were inclined to accept
man’s geological antiquity on this continent on the basis of some
a priori consideration (for which, however, there is no adequate
ground), we should seek in vain for support of the theory from mate-
rial evidence; and we can not possibly have recourse to the personal
opinions of those who, because of religious beliefs, temperamental
inclination, other bias, or imperfect observation, have claimed and
in some instances still claim the presence of man here in times far
antedating the recent or even the Glacial period.

It stands to reason that if man had originated in America and
spread thence to other continents, or if he had come here hundreds
or even scores of thousands of years ago, we should by this time
have found some evidence of his great local antiquity which could
be freely acceptable to all of us, as are the remains of Kuropean
early man. Wherever man has lived for any length of time, he has
invariably left behind him implements, utensils, and refuse con-
taining shells and bones of contemporaneous mollusks, fish, birds,
and mammals, with remains of fire. If there is no such evidence,
or at least none that the most thorough students of the subject can
conscientiously accept, then assuredly we are not justified at the
present time in accepting the theory of any geological antiquity of
the American race.

4 Detailed treatment of this question from various aspects will be found in Bulletins
33, 52, and 66, of the Bureau of American Ethnology. By “ Geological age’ is meant
age greater than that of the recent or postglacial period.

5In a preliminary report on these remains before the National Academy of Science by
Dr. John C. Merriam (Apr. 29, 1924), it was shown that they also probably are postglacial
and that their age, while doubtless considerable, is to be estimated in thousands, rather
than in tens of thousands of years. See Science, July 4, 1924.

Having reached the only possible conclusions on the two important
questions thus far considered, namely, that the American aborigines
represent a single race, and that the presence of this race on this
continent is of no demonstrated geological antiquity, we reach the
third and final complex of questions involved in the problem of the
genesis of the American Indians—the whence, when, and how of his
occupancy of the New World.

Considering the primitive means of transportation of prehistoric
man, it will be agreed, I think, that he could have come only from
those parts of the Old World that lie nearest to America. ‘These
portions are the western coast of northern Africa, northwestern
Europe, and particularly the northeastern parts of Asia; and geology
shows that there were no nearer lands or other than perhaps a far
northern (north of Bering Strait) Asiatic-American land connec-
tion, within the period that can be assigned to man’s existence.

Between Africa and South America, however, at their nearest
approach, there are nearly 2,000 miles of distance, and the separation
between the nearest points of North America and Europe is even
much greater. It is not at all likely, to say the least, that man
reached the American continent from either of these directions
except since protohistoric times, after he had sufficiently developed
a means of navigation, with those of prolonged self-sustenance; and
this likelihood would hold equally true if he had come by way of Ice-
land or Greenland, for even there the ocean stretches are very con-
siderable.

But, turning to the Asiatic continent, we find no such insuperable
difficulties. Only about 30 miles separates the two continents at
Bering Strait, and in clear weather American land is visible from
the hills of the East Cape of Asia. North of Bering Strait there
may have existed until relatively recent times an actual land connec-
tion over which many animals possibly reached the New World and
which could have served as a direct bridge for man, but as yet no
direct evidence has been obtained that man could have come at that
time. The Bering Sea itself, however, could have been crossed, by
way of St. Lawrence Island or even over the open. And much far-
ther south there is the long semilunar chain of the Aleutians which
reach to within 400 miles of Kamchatka, and even that distance
is broken nearly into halves by the Commander Islands. It is true
that the sea here is rough, and fogs prevail, but from what we know
of the achievements in navigation by the natives of the northern
Pacific coasts, in skin boats, in recent times, it is within the range
of possibility that these conditions could have been overcome and
the distance covered by men of earlier times. Here, then, we have
several practicable routes by which the Asiatics could have reached

ORIGIN OF AMERICAN INDIAN—-HRDLICKA 489

America, and their presence, with the absence of other such routes °
elsewhere, gives strong support to the view that those who eventually
became the American aborigines reached this continent from north-
eastern Asia.

Let us now turn to racial evidence. We have passed above in
brief review the principal physical and physiological characteristics
that distinguish the American aborigines. Where, in the Old World,
are there or ever were there people who approach this type most
closely ?

This was surely not in Africa, for there is liftle in common be-
tween the Negro and the Indian. It was not in historic Europe,
which, during that time and barring a few Asiatic incursions, was
peopled only by the white race. If we turn to Asia, however, we
see that large parts of Siberia and the eastern coast of the continent,
with much of Malaysia and even Polynesia, were and still are peo-
pled by nations and tribes which differ more or less from one an-
other, owing to admixtures and local differentiation, but which on
the whole are of a type that in most of its essentials resembles, or
is practically identical with, that of the Indian. This type persists
to this day with particular purity in certain parts of the Philippine
Islands (such as among the Igorrots), in Formosa, in portions of
Tibet, in parts of western China, in Mongolia, and over many parts
of Siberia. It can frequently be met with in China proper, in Korea,
and in Japan. It is a type which is characterized by the same range
of color, as well as the quality and peculiarities of distribution of
the hair; by the same dark-brown eyes with yellowish conjunctiva
and slight to moderate slant; by similar prominence of the cheek
bones and characteristics of other parts of the face; by similar fre-
quency of the hollowed-out upper front teeth; by close resemblance
in the rest of the body; and, in addition, by similar mentality
and behavior, with close affinities in other functions, as well as in
numerous habits and customs. The physical resemblances between
some members of the Asiatic groups and the average American
Indian are such that if a member of one or the other were trans-
planted and his body and hair dressed like those of the tribe in the
midst of which he was placed, he could not possibly be distinguished
physically by any means at the command of even a scientific observer.

Such resemblances can not possibly be fortuitous. They show that
eastern Asia has been and in large measure still is peopled by a type
of humanity which, while no more homogenous than for example
the white race, stands nevertheless on the whole nearest of all the
human types to that of the American aborigines. Given the close
proximity of the two continents, which would permit the passage
from one to the other of people even in a relatively primitive state
490 ANNUAL REPORT SMMMHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

of culture; and finding that, outside of heterogeneous immigrants and
mixtures, the two regions are peopled to this day by radically the
same type of humanity, there is the strongest possible argument for
the unity of origin of the eastern Asiatics and the American Indians.
And as man can scarcely be assumed to have originated in America
and to have migrated to Asia, there remains the one possible conclu-
sion that the American aborigines were derived from the Asiatic
continent; and they must have come by the northern routes, which
were not only the most practicable but were the only ones that would
enable man in the earlier stages of culture to reach the New World.
The Pacific islands were not peopled until relatively recent times,
later than America itself, and hence need not be considered in this
connection any more than historic Europe or Africa. If any parties
of these islanders ever reached the American continent, which is not
impossible, they could have come only after the Indians had spread
over it and were well established, and while such parties could have
introduced perhaps a few cultural peculiarities, they could not ma-
terially have affected the population.

Granting, on the basis of the above considerations, that the Ameri-
can aborigines came originally from Asia, we are still confronted by
the two important questions as to when and how this immigration
could have been effected.

As to the time, there is no direct evidence and none can be hoped
for. Yet it seems that in an indirect way we may approach a solution
of this mooted question.

It is self-evident that before man could have migrated from Asia
he must have peopled that continent; and he must have peopled it
in relatively large numbers, for only that would have enabled him to
overrun such an immense territory. Man does not migrate like
birds—he spreads. He is gregarious, and he is a creature of habits,
one of the strongest of which is attachment to his home, whether the
limited site of a sedentary community or the larger territory of a
nomad tribe. He will move only because of compulsion, such as
may be caused by enemies, some calamity, or the exhaustion of re-
sources; or because of better prospects ahead in the way of climate
or food. He can not be supposed to have reached the colder north-
eastern limits of Asia before the warmer, richer, or more available
parts of that continent were settled or hunted over; and he could not
have reached America, of course, before all this took place. We are
able then to establish one definite Jandmark in reference to the time
of the beginning of the peopling of America; it could only have
followed that of Asia.

This leads to the second step in our quest, namely, the peopling
of Asia itself, and more particularly of its northern portions.

Archeological researches in northern Asia, including Japan and
China, are still in their beginning, nevertheless they indicate the
presence, over a wide territory, of many remains of human occupancy,
in the form of burial mounds and of ruins, with other signs of man’s
activity. The great majority of these remains are known to be of
no great antiquity, dating from historic or late prehistoric times;
but there are also older mounds, cave remains, and dwelling sites
which yield only stone and bone implements, and primitive pottery.
These latter remains are the earliest in eastern and northeastern
Asia thus far discovered, and the culture they represent corresponds
generally to that of parts of the Neolithic epoch of Europe. And what
is true of cultural applies also to the skeletal remains from these
sites—they show relatively modern forms, much like those that
existed in the Old World during the neolithic age. We have there-
fore no evidence, or even a promise of evidence, so far, that these
farther portions of the Asiatic continent were peopled except at a
relatively recent period. It is true'that Paleolithic implements occur
in a certain region along the Yenisei River in Siberia, and that
others have been found lately in northwestern China, but these finds,
even if they should prove to represent a fairly ancient man, are
thousands of miles away from where man could have eventually
crossed over to America. Al] this leads to the strong presumption
that the beginning of migration into America did not take place be-
fore the time of the European late Paleolithic or earlier Neolithic
period, which, reduced to years, would be somewhere between pos-
sibly ten or at most fifteen thousands of years ago and the dawn of
the proto-historic period in.the Old World.

Here, however, the claim might be urged that perhaps northern
Asiatic man had a different origin from the European Neolithic
population, and may have reached the northern confines of Asia be-
fore the more westerly branch or branches of humanity peopled most
of Europe. To this it may be answered that it would be merely a
hypothesis unsupported by any material evidence. The northern
Asiatic man of all periods is too near in every important respect to
the white man to be regarded as a distant relative, much less as a
different species, as he would necessarily be if he had a separate
origin; and there is nothing that would even suggest his presence
in northeastern Asia before the existence of late Paleolithic or Neo-
lithic man of Europe. It seems much more justifiable to accept the
view that he was derived from the same stock as the European Pre-
neolithic and Neolithic population, and that he peopled Asia through
migration by the central and southern routes. But granting, for
the sake of argument, the wholly improbable supposition that he had
developed apart in or to the south of Asia, we would still have to as-
492 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

sume that, having reached a physical and cultural status practically
identical with the later prehistoric European, and having spread
over about as much territory.as he would have covered in coming
from Europe or Asia Minor, and that really in the face of greater
obstacles, his advent in the northeastern limits of the Asiatic conti-
nent could not have been any earlier than it would have been had
he started from the west and passed over the great central steppes.
The assumption, therefore, of a separate origin of the north Asiatic
and consequently the American man from that of the European,
would not make the Indian any more ancient.

Thus, from whatsoever aspect we take the question, the when of
the peopling of America does not yield to answer except in terms of
moderate antiquity corresponding in all probability with that of the
late Paleolithic to Neolithic Europeans.®

It remains for us to give thought to the mode or modes of man’s
advent into the New World and his subsequent spread and multipli-
cation on this continent.

Here it is necessary, in the first place, to free ourselves from all
notion of mass migration. The northeastern portions of the Asiatic
Continent were never fit within man’s time either to harbor or to
permit the migration of any large number of human beings at one
time. ;

The only rational conclusion in this connection seems to be the
following: The northeastern Asiatic man in relatively small nomadic
or seminomadic groups hunted and fished along the rivers and sea-
coast, living in proximity. As game diminished through this hunt-
ing or from other causes, he followed it, not southward, where other
tribes were doubtless already established, but farther northward and
eastward, in the direction of least resistance and of greater abun-
dance, until he reached the Kuriles, Kamchatka, and finally the
northeastern extremity of Asia. Before arriving at the limits of the
mainland he was doubtless already well provided with and expert
in the use of boats capable under favorable circumstances of making
prolonged sea voyages. Some party then may have struck out or
was driven eastward, reaching the Aleutian chain. Once discovered,
these islands would serve as a natural bridge, over which in the
course of time groups of Siberian natives could reach Alaska and
the American Continent. Or a party first crossed by way of Bering
Strait, or possibly by the still more northerly land connection,
if it existed. Doubtless in the course of time the Asiatic native
utilized all the practicable means of ingress to the New World.
Once on the American Continent, of better climate, full of game, and

et seq.

ORIGIN OF AMERICAN INDIAN-—HRDLICGKA 493

free of people, they would not turn back, unless to bring their fami-
lies and fellows, but would follow the game, spread rapidly and
multiply rapidly, and under favoring conditions it would not have
taken a great many centuries to people both North America and
South America,

At all events, whatever the exact circumstances of the first peopling
of the American Continent may have been, it may be safely assumed
that only relatively small parties reached the new land at one time,
and that there was no migration in mass, no flow of whole peoples.
But such comings were doubtless repeated; the news of the new land
must have reached those left behind and farther, so that the first
parties would be followed soon by others, irregularly in all proba-
bility, and on the whole very slowly, but interminably. Quite likely
there were even various rediscoveries of the New World in different
parts of its northwestern limits, and the dribbling over may be
assumed to have continued from the time the first Asiatic parties
reached the new land to the historic period, when parties of Eskimo
were found to trade across St. Lawrence Island and Bering Strait.

The newcomers, though all belonging to the same main race, were
evidently not strictly homogeneous, but represented several distinct
subtypes of the yellow-brown people, with differences in culture and
language.

The first of these subtypes to come over was, according to many
indications, the dolichocephalic Indian, represented in North Amer-
ica to-day by the great Algonquian, Iroquois, Siouan, and Sho-
shonean stocks; farther south by the Piman-Aztec Tribes; and in
South America by many branches extending over large parts of that
continent from Venezuela and the coast of Brazil to Tierra del
Fuego. The so-called “Lagoa Santa race” were merely Indians of
this type.

Next came, it seems, what Morton called the “ Toltec” type, quite
as Indian as the other, but marked by brachycephaly. This type
settled along the northwest coast, in the central and eastern mound
region, the Antilles, Mexico (including Yucatan), in the Gulf States,
over much of Central America, reaching finally the coast of Peru
and other parts of northern South America.

Still later, and when America was already well peopled, there
came, according to all indications, the Eskimo and the Athapascan
Indians. The former, finding resistance in the south which he could
not overcome, remained in and spread over the far-north land, de-
veloping various environmental physical modifications that have
removed him, on the whole, farther from the Indians than is the case
with any other branch of the yellow-brown people. The Athapas-
cans, a virile brachycephalic type, on the one side closely allied
494 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

physically to the prevailing Mongolian type of northeastern Asia
and on the other to the earlier American brachycephals,’ may have
reached the continent before the Eskimo. However this may be,
their progress southward was evidently also blocked, compelling the
body of the enlarging tribe to remain in Alaska and northwestern
Canada; but along the western coast some contingents succeeded in
penetrating as far as California, where they left the Hupa, and to
Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, and parts of northern Mexico, where
we know them as the Apache.

This, in brief, seems to be the story of the genesis of the American
indians as derived from the present and generally acceptable anthro-
pological evidence. There are still many obscure spots which future
knowledge may illuminate. The subject calls for continued research,
especially in the American Northwest and in northeastern Asia. But
the main facts appear now to be well established. ;

The peopling of America must have been one of the greatest
romances of man’s history—even though the beings coming over were
no giants or dwarfs, as sometimes imagined, nor any very ancient
form of man, but just ordinary “Indians.”

OF MONACO, AND THE RECENT PROGRESS OF HUMAN
PALEONTOLOGY IN FRANCE?

(The Huxley Memorial Lecture for 1922)

By MAR&cELLIN BOULE

Professor in the Muséum national @ Histoire naturelle, Director of the Institut
de Paléontologie humaine

* * * * * * *

I have hesitated long over the choice of a subject to discuss before
you. I am not an anthropologist in the strict sense of the term.
My scientific equipment is rather in the domain of geology and of
paleontology. It is through these two sciences that I have been led
to take up anthropology. Since man is known in the fossil state, his
earliest history will be revealed necessarily and directly through
geology and paleontology, and will be revealed only through them.

It is your illustrious predecessors, Lyell, Prestwich, Falconer,
Huxley, John Evans, who, following in the train of, and so to speak,
coming to the aid of our great precursors, Tournal, Boucher de
Perthes, Noulet, Lartet, have placed the problem of fossil man in its
true perspective; it is their work which has thrown the first light on
the great problems of geology and quaternary paleontology. The
geological observations of Lyell and of Prestwich, the paleontological
discussions of Falconer and of Mr. Boyd Dawkins, the anatomical
and philosophical observations of Huxley, and the archeological
speculations of Lubbock and of John Evans have lost nothing of
their value, although the younger generations are showing too great
a tendency to forget them.

I should have liked to discuss the underlying reasons for the de-
velopment of that fine group of British scientific men devoted to solv-
ing the great problem of our origin by the most varied methods, a
group whose ranks are still far from complete, as is shown by the
discoveries and investigations of every kind accomplished by you and
in your country in recent years. I feel that these are correlated, at
least in large part, with the geographical and geological environment.
All of the geological systems that are elsewhere isolated are found

within your territory. From the geological point of view, your Plio-
cene and Pleistocene formations are most varied; you have marine
formations, glacial formations, alluvial formations, accretional de-
posits, bone caverns, peat bogs, etc. The study of the stratigraphic
relations of these diverse formations led you early to particularly
interesting and accurate results. It is certain, for instance, that the
early observations of Lyell and of Prestwich still remain of prime
importance.

From the paleontological point of view, you have, in your Pliocene
outcrops of Norfolk, in the Pleistocene alluvial formations of your
great valleys, in the refuse deposits of your caves, in your peat bogs,
etc., an almost uninterrupted succession of fossil faunas whose study,
connected with a stratigraphic study, is of a nature singularly
adapted to the solution of chronological problems.

From the archeological point of view, your situation is somewhat
peculiar, but it is found that at different epochs, the connection of
your country with the continent has provided access to it for the
oldest populations of western Europe, so that you do not lack evidence
bearing on the ethnography of these early men, and you are able
also, perhaps better than elsewhere, to establish the most instructive
relations between all the data of geology, of paleontology, and of pre-
historic archeology.

Such a subject would therefore have much attraction for me; but
to treat it suitably before you, I should have had to devote to its
preparation much more time that my professional duties will permit.
I was still hesitating when there occurred a tragic event, the death of
Prince Albert I of Monaco, whose name will live, as you know, as one
of the greatest benefactors of science, and of whom I had the honor
of being one of the closest collaborators. Everyone knows to-day
the services which the prince has rendered to oceanography. Much
less well known, though not less great, are the services which he has
rendered to human paleontology. It seemed to me that I should be
able to interest you in speaking to you of an illustrious and mourned
benefactor of anthropology, and that I would fulfill a duty in paying
to his memory, before a select audience, the homage which is due him.
The anthropological work accomplished by the Prince or by his col-
laborators is such that in describing it I shall be able at the same
time to indicate to you the greater part of the progress recently made
in France in the field of human paleontology.

What I especially desire to explain to you is that the part played
by the Prince of Monaco was not that of a mere amateur nor of a mere
patron. He brought to the study of the great problem of the origin
of the human race the enthusiasm, and especially the spirit of coopera-
tion which he showed in his oceanographic investigations, in attack-
PRINCE ALBERT I OF MONACO—BOULE 497

ing the more general problem of the origin of life. In each case, he
has given lavishly not only of his money but of himself.

All tourists who have visited the Cote d’Azur, toward the French-
Italian frontier, know the Baoussé-Roussé, or Red Rocks, whose es-
carpments, terminating the chain of the Alps on this coast, drop per- -
pendicularly to the sea, not far from Menton, but on Italian territory,
below the ancient village of Grimaldi, once the property of the
Princes of Monaco.

These superb rocks, with their warm coloring perpetually flooded
with bright sunlight, are honeycombed with caves which open broadly
on the azure sea in an enchanting region. ‘These caves have long
been well known as a result of the discoveries which have been made
there at various times. It seems that it was a Prince of Monaco,
Florestan I, grandfather of Albert I, who first realized their scien-
tific interest. At some time prior to 1848 he sent to Paris a box of
miscellaneous débris collected in these caves. I do not know what
was done with these bones and fashioned flints in Paris, but from
the fact that they were sent 10 years before the triumph of Boucher
de Perthes, the inference is that they were not appreciated at their
true value by the men of science to whom they were probably shown.

The caverns of Menton were not long in becoming known and in
receiving visits from various naturalists and archeologists. Some
excavating, though only superficial work, had already been done
there, when in 1870 a French physician, Emile Riviére, whose health
forced him to live on the Céte d’Azur, undertook to explore the
“caverns of Menton.” His investigations were shortly to achieve suc-
cess. In 1872 he found a human skeleton in the cave called Cavillon,
under a covering of stalagmite. This is the famous “ Menton man,”
now on exhibition in the hall of anthropology of the Paris Museum.
The following year, in a neighboring cavern, he uncovered the rem-
nants of three other skeletons. In 1874 and 1875 he took two chil-
dren’s skeletons from another cave, since called for this reason
“Grotte des Enfants ”—the Children’s Cave.

These discoveries were widely noticed. Certain features about
them recalled those of the formations at Cro Magnon in the Depart-
ment of the Dordogne, explored some years before by Louis Lartet.
They attracted quite as much attention. For Riviére as for Louis
Lartet it was a question of burials of the Paleolithic age; that is, the
Pleistocene. But such great antiquity was doubted by the majority
of anthropologists who could not bring themselves to project so far
into the past the type of Homo sapiens. The most formidable of
these adversaries was Gabriel de Mortillet, who rendered great serv-
ice to prehistoric archeology, but who often obstructed the progress
of this science by his preconceived ideas and his antireligious beliefs.
498 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

It must be said that Riviére, whose recent death we mourn, had
neither the scientific training nor the necessary genius to prove his
case, although it was a worthy one. He was reproached with not
having conducted his excavations methodically or with sufficient care,
- with not having established the stratigraphy of his positions, with
having confused the various levels, and with having relied upon the
statements of his workmen. The great work which he published in
1887 on The Antiquity of Man in the Maritime Alps, poorly planned
and inaccurate on important points, was an insufficient reply to these
criticisms, and the opinion of G. de Mortillet on the Neolithic age of
all the skeletons was generally accepted, accompanied in certain
minds, however, by distressing reservations.

At this point there came upon the scene the Prince of Monaco,
whose keen scientific spirit had already long been exercised in the
domain of anthropology as well as in many other directions. From
his youth, in fact, he had anticipated his later work and had pre-
pared for it in the laboratories of Paris, discussing paleontology
with Albert Gaudry, studying prehistoric archeology with G. de
Mortillet, and working with Manouvrier on human skeletons. In
1882 and 1883 he was engaged in exploring one of the finest caves
of the Baoussé-Roussé, the Barma Grande, working himself with
his own hands and scrupulously keeping in a notebook the record
of his excavations. “The undertaking of the Prince of Monaco,”
M. de Villeneuve tells us, “has this special characteristic: It con-
templates less the assembling of a collection of prehistoric objects
than the acquisition on the spot of facts with which in his opinion
the laboratory study of the material may be correlated in such a
way as to make all the results of an excavation available for science.”

When he was obliged to be away, he charged his archivist, M.
Saige, with continuing the investigations and gave him exact in-
structions: “ No one shall work on the excavations except in your
presence * * *. It is essential to establish as exactly as possible
the levels in which the various fragments have been found in rela-
tion to the absolute surface of the ground, and especially to estab-
lish the relations of these different levels to each other. It is neces-
sary also to note the thickness and the situation of the sterile
strata—that is, those which produce nothing—for they indicate a
period during which the cave was abandoned * * *. A diary
must also be very carefully kept, so that when the cave has been
completely excavated its history may be written.” And he indi-
cated the manner of working by digging, first, a reconnaissance
trench, by following this with horizontal trenches, by sifting the
earth, etc. He did not hesitate to go into the most minute technical
PRINCE ALBERT I OF MONACO-——BOULE 499

detail.2, These are not, we see, the methods of a mere amateur but
those of a true man of science.

As a result of the various kinds of difficulties which he encoun-
tered the Prince wrote from Paris on June 15, 1883, “I see, from the
complications which our excavations are continually encountering,
that we must abandon the caves for the time being.” But this
proved only true in part. More and more desirous of achieving the
solution of the important problems of prehistoric anthropology
which presented themselves at the Baoussé-Roussé, the Prince de-
cided in 1895 to take up again the work of systematic exploration,
at first in a cave still nearly intact—the “ Grotte du Prince ”—then
in some of the neighboring caves which already had been super-
ficially excavated but whose deposits of refuse were still partly in
place.

These new excavations lasted nearly 10 years. They were con-
ducted by M. le Chanoine de Villeneuve and his aid, M. Lorenzi,
methodically, skillfully, and with devotion, as I am able to testify
through my frequent and long stays in Monaco. They furnished
valuable scientific results, which were presented in a large work
published sumptuously under the auspices of the prince. I shall
call your attention for a moment to the most important of these
results.

The “ Grotte du Prince ” is the largest of the group. The explora-
tion work took out more than 4,000 cubic meters of the material,
which filled it and permitted the study of two kinds of deposits:

1. The lowest—that is, the oldest—represents an ancient coast
line, with Mediterranean shells and without northern species; Seneg-
alese forms, such as Strombus bubonius, indicate warmer water than
at present.

2. Over this marine formation are superimposed, more than 15
meters in thickness, formations of subaerial origin in which are
found fireplaces, or heaps of ashes, especially rich in bones of
animals and corresponding to the successive periods of human occu-
pation. Two groups of fireplaces can be distinguished. A lower
group is characterized by mammals of the oldest period of Quater-
nary time, and denoting a warm climate, such as the hippopotamus.
The higher group contains the bones of “cold ” species, such as the
reindeer. The superposition of these two faunas—one warm, the
other cold—had not before been established in a country so far south.

The stratigraphic and paleontological study of the “Grotte du
Prince ” has shown us that this succession should be admitted for the
Cote d’ Azur as well as for the Pyrenees, the banks of the Seine, or
those of the Thames.

But there was an outcome even more unexpected. It is not the
culture known as Chellean which was found in the lower levels with
the warm fauna, the fauna of the lower Pleistocene, but rather the
Mousterian culture, commonly associated in Europe with the mam-
moth fauna. This fact caused surprise, I might almost say conster-
nation, among the prehistoric archeologists, too prone to believe in
the stability and the chronological infallibility of the various types
of Paleolithic implements. They discussed it freely and interpreted
it in various ways. Of the two conflicting methods—the geological
and the archeological—I firmly believe that here the latter should
give way to the former. The facts of a geological and paleontologi-
cal nature have a more general signification and bearing than the
ethnographic facts because they do not depend, as do the latter, on
human action. I am able, moreover, to announce to you the very
recent discovery by M. de Villeneuve, of a rude Chellean industry
in the cave of “Observatoire,” located in Monaco itself, and in a
stratigraphic level situated rather above than below the level of
the warm fauna and the Mousterian industry of the “Grotte du
Prince.” It is therefore not to be doubted that since the lower
Pleistocene there have been different archeological facies in the sev-
eral regions inhabited by men who might also have differed among
themselves.

The “Grotte du Prince” has taught us many other things. The
exceptional fact of the existence, at the same place and in contact
with each other, of a marine fauna and a fauna of Pleistocene mam-
mals, has put a new light on the chronology of the changes during
Quaternary time in the level of the ocean and in the configuration
of the Mediterranean shores. I have attempted to establish the
relation of these variations to glacial phenomena and to the phenom-
ena of erosion and filling in of valleys, and in the light of all
these facts, to explain the exchange of faunas between Africa and
Europe. Moreover, the fine state of preservation of the innumer-
able paleontological specimens collected in this cavern has enabled
me to bring new facts to bear on the history and the geographical
distribution of the Pleistocene mammals.

But the “Grotte du Prince” did not yield the slightest trace of
human remains, and this was most unfortunate, for we had counted
on the integrity of the deposits of this fine locality to determine
once for all the age of the various burials found in the neighboring
caves, concerning which discussion was still going on.
PRINCE ALBERT I OF MONACO—BOULE © 501

The Prince decided then to move his workshop elsewhere. The
“Grotte des Enfants” had been only partly excavated. There still
remained nearly 8 meters in thickness of untouched deposits. Here
the investigations achieved the greatest success from an anthropo-
logical point of view: Four human skeletons were discovered at
three different levels. The stratigraphic and paleontological ob-
servations made it possible to solve definitely the problem of the
age of the formerly and recently discovered human skeletons at the
Baoussé-Roussé.

The chief conclusion from these observations is that all of the
skeletons are indeed Pleistocene. Those from the upper layers go
back at most to the reindeer period. My learned colleague and
friend, M. Verneau, who had already published interesting accounts
of the skeletons of the Barma Grande, was invited by the Prince to
make an anthropological study of them. He had no difficulty in
showing that both belonged clearly to the Cro-Magnon race. It was
the task of my dear friend Cartailhac, whom our science has mourned
for a long time, to show in the archeological memoir, which he
willingly undertook to prepare, that all of these burials, those of
the Dordogne as well as those of the Cote d’Azur, were associated
with the same accessories, pierced shells, objects of ornamentation.
bone colored red, etc., and all bore witness to the same culture.

The two skeletons from the lower level are of an earlier epoch, of
an age difficult to determine exactly, but which I have every reason
to believe Mousterian, or closely allied to Mousterian. They also
constituted a burial, and you all know that after having made a
careful study of them M. Verneau concluded that they belonged to a
special race, presenting numerous negroid characters, which he called
the “ Grimaldi race.” The fact is of prime importance for several
reasons. First, because we are here in the presence of a human
type of an age very near that of the Neanderthal, if not of
the same age, and the coexistence in western Europe in the same
geological epoch of two such different human forms gives us much
to think about; also because the resemblances of this new type, show-
ing many traits in common with certain African races of Homo
sapiens, lead us to believe that the “statuettes of Menton,” with
equally negroid and steatopygous characters, are rude effigies of
this type. ; >

The authenticity of these statuettes was discussed for a long time,
especially because the exact circumstances of their discovery remained
quite obscure, Riviére and G. de Mortillet considering them as the
work of a clever forger who attempted to imitate the ivory figurines
discovered by Piette 4 Brassempony in the Pyrenees.

1454—25——33
502 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

Another objective of the excavations organized by the Prince was
to clear up this mystery. In this respect also the results were note-
worthy. Although no new statuettes were discovered, there was
found in an Aurignacian fireplace of the “ Grotte du Prince,” a frag-
ment of soft rock, or steatite, identical with the material of the first
statuettes, which showed the beginnings of sculpture. If there was
still needed additional proof of the authenticity and of the antiquity
of these objects of primitive art, it was found in the uniformity of
physiognomy and in the general similarity shown by all the works of
the same class made in different countries quite distant from each
other. Very recently, this summer in fact, M. and Mme. de Saint-
Perier discovered in a cave in the Pyrenees, also in an Aurignacian
stratum, a fine female statuette in ivory, one of the most beautiful
objects which has been found so far in a Paleolithic deposit. The
style of this statuette is very close to that of the Menton figurines.
You will very shortly see photographic reproductions and a descrip-
tion of it in “ L’Anthropologie.”

These are the chief results of the work carried on under the direc-
tion and at. the expense of the Prince of Monaco in the caves of Gri-
maldi. The precious relics resulting from these excavations and
brought to light after so many thousands of years constitute the most.
venerable archives of humanity. They must be preserved as we pre-
serve the archives of written history, and with this end in view the
Prince organized the Anthropological Museum of Monaco, the direc-
tion of which he entrusted to his learned and devoted collaborator,
M. de Villeneuve. Here are exhibited methodically, in galleries
lighted by great bays opening on the blue sea, an innumerable series
of objects carefully arranged and labeled. Large specimens give an
idea of the character and the composition of certain fossil-bearing
strata. Vertical glass cases are filled with fine paleontological speci-
mens. The human skeletons occupy the center of the main hall on
the first floor. They are surrounded by archeological objects classified
by levels. On the walls, plans and sections of the caverns of Baoussé-
Roussé enable visitors to visualize the nature and the stratigraphy of
the positions. The other halls contain, among other collections, the
results of similar excavations carried on in various caves located in
territory belonging to the principality, notably in the Neolithic caves
of Bas-Mouliys and the Spélugues. All this material forms a whole
which daily attracts many visitors and which keenly interested the
members of the thirteenth session of the International Congress of
Anthropology and Prehistoric Archeology held in Monaco in 1906.

The Prince also rendered still another great service to our studies
when he took this Congress, whose fate appeared at that time very
doubtful, under his protection. And those among you who were
PRINCE ALBERT I OF MONACO—BOULE 503

present at the session at Monaco still recall the success of this gather-
ing, enriched with all the delights of a truly princely hospitality.
May I be permitted to here express regret that after the terribly
sterile period of the Great War anthropologists have not recognized
that instead of seeking to create a new more or less international
organization they should devote themselves to reviving an institu-
tion whose brilliant past should vouch for the future?

The Prince, pleased with the results which he has thus obtained,
looked only for a new opportunity to render further services to the
study of human paleontology. Such an opportunity was not long in
presenting itself. On all sides discoveries relative to Quaternary art
were multiplying. Cartailhac returned from Altamira with port-
folios full of photographs and crayon sketches cleverly drawn by M.
Breuil. In his enthusiasm he had made magnificent chromolitho-
graphic plates for the work which he intended to publish with his
collaborator. But he soon perceived that the undertaking was too
great and beyond his moderate financial means. With the help of
that learned and lamented archivist of the Palace of Monaco, Gustave
Saige, I had no difficulty in interesting the prince in the incom-
pleted work. He generously took over all the expense of the publi-
cation of this magnificent volume entitled “Altamira,” to-day in
every large library in the world, which is only the beginning of the
list of a series of magnificent volumes devoted to the description of
the mural paintings and engravings of the Paleolithic caverns.

M. Breuil was particularly adept in this new form of investigation.
The prince gave him every facility for pursuing his work not only in
France but also in Spain; and it is to this interest that the broad
scope of prehistoric studies in the Iberian peninsula, a development
of which we have been for some years the admiring witnesses, is due.

This period of about 10 years immediately preceding the terrible
phenomenon of human retrogression provoked by Germany in 1914,
was in France truly a great period for human paleontology and pre-
history. Investigators were numerous; they made valuable observa-
tions and sometimes important discoveries in all parts of France.
In the Pyrenees, already well known through the finds and the
investigations of Piette, it was shown by Cartailhac, Breuil, and
Begouen that many of the caves were real museums of Quaternary
art whose masterpieces they hastened to make known to us through
preliminary publications. In the Dordogne, Riviére, Capitan,
Peyrony, Bouyssonie (I mention only the most able or the most
fortunate workers) also made great discoveries. Doctor Lalanne
revealed to us the superb frieze of sculptured horses and the bas-
reliefs of human figures of Laussel. And, at the same time, MM.
les Abbés Bardon and Bouyssonie exhumed the man of Chapelle-
504 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

aux-Saints, MM. Capitan and Peyrony discovered in the deposits of
la Ferrassie a whole series of skeletons of the same period and no less
well preserved ; while not far from there, at La Quina, Dr. H. Martin
made similar finds of equal interest. Thanks to all these important
discoveries, it has been possible to study the Mousterian man of
our country, the Homo neanderthalensis, in as complete a manner as
possible, in all parts of his bony framework, which is to-day better
known to us than that of many present-day savages. The multi-
plicity of discoveries has enabled us to demonstrate the very in-
teresting homogeneity of this archaic type. This constitutes a great
step forward in the domain of human paleontology, and the mind
of the Prince of Monaco was keenly alive to it.

_ The first in chronological order of these discoveries, that of the
man of La Chapelle-aux-Saints, caused a great stir. After its
presentation in purely scientific publications, the press. made it
known to the public, which evinced a keen interest in it. At this
time innumerable visitors passed through my laboratory in the
museum to see the skull which had already become famous, and
these visitors came from every social and intellectual class of the
capital. The Prince of Monaco himself joined this pilgrimage.
He came to see me one summer afternoon. Greatly impressed by the
sight of this venerable osteological specimen, he stayed for a long
time contemplating it, examining it from all sides, studying the
peculiar details of its morphology. Then evening came on; the
setting sun flamed beyond the dome of the Panthéon and the more
slender silhouettes of the other monuments of Mount Sainte-Gene-
viéve. There, in this beautiful setting, the Prince made me a part
of a new project which he had been considering for a long time and
which he now decided to put into execution. He requested me to
prepare for him a plan of organization for an institute of human
paleontology.

His mind had been keenly struck by the contrast recauted by
the immense interest and the philosophical importance of our
studies and the paucity of means of action heretofore put at the
service of human paleontology, truly a French science, though
almost ignored by the powers that be in the official, academic, and
university circles of our country. And in his great generosity he
wished to be the Prince Charming to this new Cinderella. He
clearly defined his purpose in the first phrase of the letter which
he wrote on November 23, 1910, to the Minister of Public Instruc-
tion in announcing his intentions:

“Tn the course of my busy life,” he said, “I have often regretted
that in the intellectual movement of our time more prominence has
not been given to the study of the mystery which envelops the
PRINCE ALBERT I OF MONACO—BOULE 505

origin of humanity. As my mind has been more and more en-
lightened through scientific study, I have wished more and more
ardently to see established on a methodical basis the investigations
necessary to bring to light the fugitive traces which our ancestors
have left in the bowels of the earth during an incalculable suc-
cession of centuries. And I have thought that the philosophy and
the morale of human societies would be less uncertain in the pres-
ence of the history of generations written with their own dust.”

Having thus resolved to create “a powerful center for studies
based on methodical excavations,” the Prince of Monaco presented
it with the building necessary for its establishment and with an
endowment of 1,600,000 francs. On December 15, 1910, the Insti-
tute of Human Paleontology was recognized as a public utility by
the French Government.

According to its plan of organization, the new establishment,
placed under my direction, has for its purpose the progress of sci-
ence on all questions relating to the origin and history of fossil man.

The principal means of action are: (1) Laboratories where the
results of excavations carried on by the personnel of the institute
or by other workers under its direction are studied; (2) publica-
tions to make known the results of the excavations and of scientific
investigations; and (3) courses and lectures on human paleontology
and prehistory.

Without waiting for the construction of the building, which would
require some time, Professors Breuil and Obermaier undertook in
France, in Spain, and in central Europe extensive explorations and
excavations, while some independent workers were through grants
assisted in their investigations.

The new edifice constructed by the architect Pontremoli was soon
finished. To-day it adorns, with its beautiful facades, that part of
the Boulevard Saint-Marcel recently occupied by the horse market.
-Its fagades are the work of the clever chisel of M. Constant Roux,
for which the theme was furnished by our founder himself. The
Prince of Monaco desired, in fact, that his new institute should have
an attractive exterior in a relevant as well as artistic style, reveal-
ing at first glance, through the choice of the decorative motifs, all
the interest of the studies which are carried on there.

Large basements contain rooms for the unpacking and provi-
sional classification of the results of excavations and workshops for
preparation of material and for modeling. On the ground floor
there are a large hall for lectures and exhibits, general adminis-
trative offices and chemical laboratories, and the workrooms of the
professors.
506 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

The institute is not a museum, and its purpose is not to accu-
mulate collections. But it should have for instruction and for
study as complete a series as possible of objects for comparison in
the various fields of prehistoric ethnography, anthropology, com-
parative anatomy, and the paleontology of the late geological epochs.
These series, of the greatest importance to-day, are arranged and
classified in three rooms, called rooms for comparative studies,
which encircle the first floor, and a large library which is comple-
mentary to these, the objects to be studied near the books. The
library, which has just been enriched by the fine collection of Emile
Cartailhac, is also arranged as a workroom, and several offices on
this same floor are reserved for distinguished scientists who wish
to visit the institute.

The material from the excavations, unpacked, sorted, cleaned, and
prepared in the basement rooms, photographed on the ground floor,
and studied on the second floor, may then form the subject of pub-
lished memoirs. The third story contains besides a drafting room,
compartments where the publications are stored. These serve to
enrich the library of the institute through exchanges. Some copies
are sold commercially through MM. Masson et Cie., publishers.®

The institute was to have been opened at the end of 1914. The
war played havoc with it as with all.other scientific establishments.
Yor six years it was forced to live a stunted life. On December 23,
1920, it was officially opened in the presence of M. Millerand, Presi-
dent of the French Republic, and many guests, including members
of the Government, and of the diplomatic corps, representatives of
great scientific establishments, learned societies, the press, etc.

One year later, on February 18, 1922, the Prince had the pleasure
of presiding at the first public lecture, and of verifying the truly
popular success of the undertaking he had recently inaugurated.
In spite of a state of health which already caused keen anxiety
among his friends, he delivered an address in which, as always,
originality and richness of form clothed strong and noble thoughts,
and of which each phrase bore witness to his respect for and love
of science. “ You are here,” he said, “in a new temple which I
have created in order that anthropology, supported by sound laws,
can soar one day over the mysteries which surround us. I hope
that it may bring to civilization the cooperation of the great forces
contained in its bosom, which will purify our customs, our ideas,

5 The principal publications are: “‘ Les Grottes de Grimaldi,’’ by MM. de Villeneuve, M.
Boule, E. Cartailhac, R. Verneau, 2 vols., quarto, with 64 plates in heliogravure; the
series, comprising 5 vols. in quarto, on the “ Peintures et gravures murales des cavernes
paleolithiques,” with a total of 217 plates in black and in colors; “ Les anciens Pata-
gons,” by Dr. R. Verneau, 1 vol. in quarto, with 15 plates; the 13th session of the “ Con-
gres internationa! d’Anthropologie et d’Archeologie prehistoriques,’ Monaco, 1906, 2 vols..
octavo; and a little series of ‘‘ Rapports annuels,” by the director and the professors.

PRINCE ALBERT I OF MONACO—BOULE 507

our social relations, when humanity knows whence it came and
understands where it is going.” The audience, which could not all
be accommodated in the lecture hall, thanked him by long applause.

This was his last visit to the establishment of which he was justly
proud and for which he showed the affection of a father for his
jast-born. Some weeks later, on his sick bed, he talked with me
of the great future he foresaw for our science. And in an affection-
ate tone which I shall never forget, he wished to thank once more
his collaborators for the intellectual pleasures which they had pro-
vided him, the pleasures to which this sovereign prince attached
the greatest value. Some weeks later, on June 26 last, he succumbed.
His will, drawn in terms of rare nobility, constitutes a final glowing
testimonial of his devotion to the interests of science, the chief aim of
a life wholly devoted to labor and to the progress of humanity.

You have here, gentlemen and dear colleagues, an existence and
a work which overstep, through their greatness and importance,
the limits of geographical territory where they were begun. The
eminent services rendered to science by Prince Albert I, of Monaco,
were not exclusively in favor of that France of which he was always
the faithful and devoted friend. The results accomplished, thanks
to his influence and to his liberality, are to-day a part of the uni-
versal patrimony. And his activity, from which my country was
the first to benefit, was also beneficial to other countries, where it
acted as a sort of catalytic force, inciting great activity in the
field of our studies and inducing emulation everywhere. It is,
therefore, not alone the progress in France in the course of these
last 20 years in the domain of human paleontology which resulted
in great part from the anthropological work of Prince Albert; the
progress made nearly everywhere also depended on it in a more or
less direct way.

Jt was through the unlimited realization of progress of this kind
that this “ prince of science and art,” this “useful prince,” foresaw
for humanity better days, as shown by this phrase written by him:
“TT have cultivated science because it diffuses knowledge, and knowl-
edge engenders justice.”

THE RUINED CITIES OF PALESTINE, EAST AND WEST
OF THE JORDAN’

By ArtHur W. Sutton, Esq., J. P., F. L. 8.

[With 8 plates]

The view of Beirut as we enter the harbor is most beautiful.
The foreshore, covered with red-tiled houses, is backed by groves of
mulberry and pomegranite trees; and behind these are the sloping
hillsides terraced with the cultivation of vines and olives, with the
mountains of Lebanon in the distance covered with snow.

After crossing for some miles very soft plains, once vineyards
and olive yards, but now a sandy desert with a few pines, planted a
hundred years ago by the governor of Beirut to consolidate the soil,
we come to the River Damur and then to the orange groves round
Sidon, second only to those at Jaffa. Sidon is not only the most
ancient city of Pheenicia, but one of the oldest of the known cities
of the world, and is said by Josephus to have been built by Sidon,
the eldest son of Canaan, and is mentioned with high praise by
Homer in the /iad, where he says that as early as the Trojan war
the Sidonian mariners, having provoked the enmity of the Trojans,
were by them despoiled of the gorgeous robes manufactured by
Sidon’s daughters, these being considered so valuable and precious
as to propitiate the goddess of war in their favor. Sidon was re-
nowned for its skill in arts, science, and literature, maritime com-
merce and architecture; and according to Strabo the Sidonians were
celebrated for astronomy, geometry, navigation, and philosophy.

Sidon was captured by Shalmaneser in 720 B. C., and it was
again taken in 350 B. C. by Artaxerxes Ochus. It fell to Alexander
the Great without a struggle, and afterwards came into possession
successively of the Seleucide and the Ptolemies. During the time
of the Crusaders Sidon was four times taken, plundered, and dis-
mantled. Excavations have revealed several rock-hewn tombs, with
elaborately carved sarcophagi. The most celebrated is the sar-
cophagus of Alexander, which before the war was in the mosque
at Constantinople. He was certainly never buried in it. A sar-
cophagus was opened the other day at Sidon, full of fluid and con-
taining a beautiful body in perfect preservation, but immediately it
was lifted from the fluid it lost all shape.

At Zarephath we saw the churning of butter in a leather bag full
of milk, which is swayed backwards and forwards until it is formed.

This is the site of Sarepta, where Elijah raised the widow’s son
to life (I Kings, xvii, 8-24); and near here, on the coasts of Tyre
and Sidon, our Lord healed the daughter of the Canaanitish woman.

We next approached Tyre, now called Sur, from which the name
of Syria is derived—Syria really meaning the land of the Tyrians
or Surians. The origin of Tyre is lost in the mist of centuries,
and Isaiah says its “antiquity is of ancient days” (xxiil, 7). Her-
odotus states it was founded about 2,300 years before his time, i. e.,
2750 B. C. William of Tyre declares it was called after the name
of its founder, “Tyrus, who was the seventh son of Japhet, the
son of Noah.” Strabo spoke of it as the most considerable city of
all Phoenicia. Sidon was certainly the more ancient city of the
two, but Tyre by far the more celebrated and one of the greatest
cities of antiquity. It was besieged by Nebuchadnezzar for 30
years. The siege of the city by Alexander the Great in 332 B. C.
was the most remarkable and disastrous episode in the history of
Tyre. The island city held out for seven months, but was finally
captured by being united to the mainland by a mole formed of the
stones, timber, and rubbish of old Tyre on the shore, which were
conveyed into position by the Grecian army. Then the island was
made a peninsula, in which form it exists at the present day. This
siege was so remarkable a fulfilment of the prophesies of Ezekiel
that the words of the Hebrew prophet read more like a history than
a prediction. “Therefore thus saith the Lord God: Behold, I am
against thee, O Tyre, and will cause many nations to come up against
thee, as the sea causeth his waves to come up. And they shall
destroy the walls of Tyre, and break down her towers: I will also
scrape her dust from her and make her a bare rock. She shall
be a place for the spreading of nets in the midst of the sea; for I
have spoken it, saith the Lord God: and she shall become a spoil
to the nations * * * and they shall make a spoil of thy riches,
and make a prey of thy merchandise: and they shall break down
thy walls and destroy thy pleasant houses: and they shall lay thy
stones and thy timber and thy dust in the midst of the waters”
(Ezekiel, xxvi, 3-5, 12).

In more modern times the city was taken by the Mohammedans,
the lives and property of the inhabitants being spared on condition
that there should be “no building of new churches, no ringing of
bells, no riding on horseback, and no insults to the Moslem religion.”
Tyre was retaken-by the Christians in 1124, but once more fell
into Moslem hands at the final collapse of the Crusades in 1291.
It was then almost entirely destroyed, and the place has never since
recovered, though of late years there have been signs of a slight

revival of commerce, and the city is gradually becoming more popu-
lous. In the middle of the last century it had fallen so low that
Hasselquist, a traveler, found but 10 inhabitants in the place.

The ruins which are now found in the peninsula are those of
Crusaders’ or Saracenic work. The city of the Crusaders lies
several feet beneath the débris, and below that are the remains
of the Mohammedan and early Christian Tyre. The ancient capital
of the Pheenicians lies far, far down beneath the superincumbent
ruins.

The ancient glory of Tyre has been described in Ezekiel with a
graphic power of description and minute accuracy of detail which
is scarcely equaled in the annals of literature. Strabo ascribes the
prosperity of Tyre to two causes—“ partly to navigation, in which
the Pheeenicians have at all times surpassed other nations, and
partly to their purple, for the Tyrian purple is acknowledged to
be the best; the fishing for this purpose is carried on not far off.”
The far-famed Tyrian dye was extracted from the glands of a pe-
culiar species of shellfish (Afurex trunculus). Pliny says that the
reason why Tyre was so famous in ancient times was “ for its off-
spring, the cities to which it gave birth.”

Nearly the whole of ancient Tyre now lies buried fathoms deep
beneath the surface of the sea, the only thing remaining visible
now of the ancient city being an enormous mass of magnificent
granite and marble columns and ruins, which lie in the northern
harbor, submerged by the sea, but distinctly visible when the wate
is clear. Thus literally have Tyre’s stones and dust been hid
“in the midst of the waters.” “ What city is like Tyrus, like the
destroyed in the midst of the sea?” (Ezekiel, xxvii, 32.)

Passing up the Wady Ashur, one of the most picturesque and
interesting ravines in Syria, we find ourselves in the region of the
wonderful Pheenician rock sculptures and tombs, and camp at
Tibnin, whose fine large castle has been the chief feature of the
landscape for some two hours before we arrive. The castle was
founded by Hugh de St. Omer, Count of Tiberias, about 1104.

The second day’s ride from Zarephath, where we had camped
_ for our visit to Tyre, brings us to Safed, one of the four sacred
cities of the Jews, occupying a conspicuous position on the sum-
mit and slopes of a lofty mountain, and supposed to be the place
referred to when our Lord said “A city that is set on a hill can not
be hid” (Matthew, v. 14). To-day it contains about 15,000 in-
habitants—9,000 Jews, 6,000 Moslems, and a few Christians. Like
many other towns of Palestine, it is filthy beyond description. It
was almost entirely destroyed by the great earthquake of 1837,
when great numbers of the inhabitants perished. Baldwin III
fled here after his defeat in 1157, and Saladin captured it after
the Battle of Hattin in 1187.
512 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

We now reach Tiberias. It has a population of about 6,000,
of whom 4,000 are Jews, 300 Christians, and the rest Moslems,
and is one of the four sacred cities of the Jews in Palestine. The
earlier city of Tiberias was spoken of by Joshua (xix, 35) under
the name of Rakkath. The Roman city was built by Herod Anti-
pas, and dedicated by him to the Emperor Tiberias (A. D. 16).
After the Battle of Hattin, 1187, Tiberias fell into the hands of
Saladin.

The Hammam or hot baths (temperature 144° F.) are to the
south of the city, and are visited by people from all parts of the
country. ‘They occupy the site of Hammath, spoken of by Joshua
(xix, 35) and by Pliny. Our Lord never entered Tiberias, as,
according to early tradition, it was built on an ancient cemetery.

We now proceed round the foot of the lake and up the gorge
of the Yarmuk, from Tiberias to Deraa. Following the caravan
road down the western side of the lake we come to an old ruined
bridge over the Jordan, about a mile south of where it flows out
of the Sea of Galilee, and ford the river on horseback; and after
crossing the railway from Haifa to Deraa and Damascus at the
station of Semakh, we follow the railway up the gorge of the River
Yarmuk to the hot springs of Amatha. These springs are eight
in number, some of them several miles up the valley, but the principal
ones are close to a place called El Hamma. Their temperatures
are 115°, 103°, 92°, and 83° F., respectively. The principal spring
is in a basin about 40 feet in circumference and 5 feet deep. The
water is so hot that the hand can not be kept in it for any length of
time, and is considered by the Arabs to be a sovereign cure for
many disorders. Herod is supposed to have come here to be cured,
and the Baths of Amatha were considered by the Romans as second
only to those of Bais, and were much extolled by Eusebius and
other ancient writers.

From the hot springs we climb up by a very steep pathway by
the side of the gorge to Gadara, occupying a magnificent site on
the western promontory of the plateau overlooking the Lake of
Tiberias. Captured by Antiochus the Great, 218 B. C., it was, 20
years afterwards, taken from the Syrians by Alexander Jannzus
after a siege of 10 months. The Jews retained possession of it for
some time, but, the city having been destroyed during their civil
wars, it was rebuilt by Pompey to gratify the desire of one of his
freedmen, who was a Gadarene. It was surrendered to Vespasian
in the Jewish war. It was one of the most important cities east of
the Jordan and called by Josephus the capital of Perea, and was
subsequently the seat of the bishopric Palestina Secunda.

The ruins of the two open-air theaters still exist, one with a full
view of the Lake of Galilee in the distance below. There are enor-
mous quantities of tombs everywhere, by which the neighborhood

is honeycombed, many of these having massive basalt doors which
still swing on their hinges. More than 200 stone sarcophagi have
been taken out of these tombs, and now lie scattered among the ruins
of the city.

At Beit er-Ras we come on very extensive ruins—arches of great
size, columns, Corinthian and Ionic capitals, chiefly composed of
basalt; a vast subterranean ruin, with several fine arches under-
ground. Inscriptions, chiefly Nabathean, are to be found among
the ruins. This was a city of great importance in the Roman Em-
pire, and has been identified withh Capitolias, one of the cities of
the Decapolis.

We now reach Deraa or Dera’a (old Edrei), which to-day is a
junction where passengers dine on the railway journey to Damascus;
it is a remarkable place, for at least four cities exist here one above
another. The present Arab buildings are on the top of a Greco-
Roman city, and this again stands on the remains of one still older,
in which beveled stones are used. Beneath this again is a troglo-
dyte city entirely excavated in the rock on which the upper cities
stand, the subterranean residence of King Og. The following pas-
sages of Scripture refer to Edrei:

“Og, the King of Bashan, went out against them, he and all his
people, to battle at Edrei” (Numbers xxi, 33). “Moses * * *
after he had smitten * * * Og the King of Bashan which -
dwelt in Ashtaroth at Edrei” (Deuteronomy, i, 4). “ Salecah and
Edrei, cities of the Kingdom of Og” (Deuteronomy, iii, 10).

The most prominent of the ruins, covering a circuit of 2 miles,
are those of a large reservoir of Roman times, fed by a great aque-
duct. There is a building, 44 by 31 yards, with a double colonnade,
evidently a Christian cathedral, but now a mosque. The most nota-
ble remains, however, are the caves beneath the citadel. They form
a subterranean city, a labyrinth of streets with shops and houses,
and a market place. This probably dates in its present elaborate
form from Greek times, but such refuges must always have been the
feature of a land so swept by Arab Tribes. The Crusaders who
besieged it called it Adratum (Encyclopedia Biblica).

Merril writes: “When King Baldwin III (1144-1162) and his
Crusaders made their wild chase to Bosrah, they went by way of
Dra’a. The weather was hot, and the army was suffering terribly
for want of water, but as often as they let down their buckets by
means of ropes into the cisterns, men concealed on the inside of the
cisterns would cut the ropes and thus defeat their efforts.” Probably
the underground city has connection with all the important cisterns
of the place.

From Edrei we travel to Jerash, or Gerasa, which is a city of
stupendous ruins, second only to Palmyra in size and importance,

*
514 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

and second only to Baalbec in beauty of architecture. In many
respects it surpasses them both, and as a perfect specimen of an
ancient Grecian city it has no equal. These ruins, says Doctor
Tristran, “in number, in beauty of situation, and in isolation, were
by far the most striking and interesting I had yet seen in Syria.”
The later name, Philadelphia, was given to the city by Ptolemy II
(Philadelphus), King of Egypt, who rebuilt the city in the third
century B. C. Greek immigration flowed into Syria after the con-
quest of Alexander the Great. The Greeks gradually extended
beyond Jordan, sometimes occupying the old sites and sometimes
building new cities, as at Jerash.

According to Pliny, Gerasa was one of the original 10 cities
of the Decapolis. It is mentioned by Ptolemy, Strabo, Pliny, and
other Greek and Roman writers, but no details are given of its
history. We are informed that it was noted for its men of learning,
and that it was the “ Alexandria of Decapolis.” It does not seem
to correspond to any Old Testament site. The Crusaders made a
campaign against it, in trying to form an eastern frontier for the
Holy Land.

Exactly how or when the city was destroyed is not known. After
going down in the Mohammedan invasion, it was probably left
deserted for hundreds of years, because the state of the ruins after
700 years points clearly to the action of an earthquake and not
the hand of man. An Arabian geographer, at the beginning of the
thirteenth century, describes Gerasa as deserted. Hence we have
here a Greek or Roman town standing as it was left 700, if not 1,200,
years ago.

High above the Peribolos or Forum, on a rocky knoll, supported
and surrounded by a massive substructure, stands the ruin of a great
temple, whose superb situation commands the whole town and looks
straight north along the colonnaded street. The walls of this tem-
ple are 71% feet thick.

Outside the city, says Doctor Green, there are the remains of a
naumachia or theater, for the representation of naval spectacles,
consisting of a vast stone reservoir 700 feet by 300 feet, surrounded
by tiers of seats and supplied by conduits.

Not very far off is the site of the great and important city of
Rabbath-Ammon, the ancient capital of the Ammonites, who, with
the Moabites, are said to have been descended from Lot. These
two nations drove out the gigantic aboriginal inhabitants east of
the Dead Sea and the Jordan. Rabbath-Ammon is first mentioned
in Deuteronomy III, 11, as the place where the “iron bedstead” of
the giant King of Bashan was deposited; but it is celebrated chiefly
for the siege against it by the Israelites under Joab, when Uriah
the Hittite was slain—the blackest spot in David’s history.
RUINED CITIES OF PALESTINE—SUTTON 515

There are the ruins of a theater in good preservation, with 48
tiers of seats calculated to hold 6,000 people, and so admirably
arranged that, as may be tested to this day, ordinary conversation
on the stage could be distinctly heard on the topmost semicircle.

Joab first took “the city of the waters”—that is, evidently, the
lower town, along the banks of the river. But the citadel still
held out, therefore messengers were sent to David asking for a
reinforcement and the presence of the King himself, in consequence
of which David went in person and captured the citadel, with an
immense quantity of spoil. In the third century B. C. the city was
rebuilt by Ptolemy Philadelphus, King of Egypt, and called Phil-
adelphia, under which name it is frequently mentioned by Greek
and Roman writers. There are the remains of a large Christian
church in the lower city.

The exterior walls of the citadel are constructed of large stones
closely jointed, without cement, bearing in places the marks of
high antiquity. The most interesting building on the citadel hill
appears to be a specimen of the Sassanian architecture of Persia,
probably dating from the same period as the Dome of the Rock at
Jerusalem. The paneling and scrollwork on the walls is very beau-
tiful and perfect, closely allied to Assyrian work. These buildings
form a link between the Byzantine architecture and that of Persia.

We next reach what is evidently the site of Medaba, a city of the
Moabites, taken by Joshua and given, with its plain, to the tribe of
Reuben (Numbers, xxi, 30; Joshua, xiii, 9,16). It was on the plain
east of the city that Joab defeated the combined forces of Ammon
and Syria, avenging the insult offered to the ambassadors of King
David (I Chronicles, xix).

Madeba was recaptured by the Moabites at the Captivity and is
therefore included in the prophetic curse pronounced upon Moab in
Isaiah, xv, 2. It was an important fortress during the rule of the
Maccabees and it became an episcopal city in the early centuries of
our era. Here was discovered a large tesselated map of Palestine.

_Not far from Madeba is Dibon, which is now nothing more than
a shapeless mass of ruins, but obtained a new celebrity in 1868 by
the discovery of the Moabite Stone, containing a long inscription
in which is recorded some of the acts of that King Mesha who is
mentioned in II Kings, iii. The inscription is in the old Phoenician
character and appears to be of the age of Mesha. The stone was
unfortunately broken by the Arabs, but most of the fragments are
now in the Louvre.

Mount Nebo runs out westward from the plateau with a narrow
ridge, at trend of which is the summit, Pisgah, and the ascent to
this ridge is Sufa or Zophim. Here we stand on a sitc rendered
memorable by two important events connected with the history of

ea
516 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

the Israelitish occupation of Canaan. Hither Balak brought Balaam
to curse the people (Numbers, xxli-xxiv), and hence Moses viewed the
Promised Land (Deuteronomy xxxiv, 1). But toward the west, in
the direction which Moses surveyed, there is a very wide and exten-
sive view. The mountain ranges of Judea lie straight before us, °
with Jerusalem, Bethlehem, and the Frank Mountain clearly visible.
The Russian Tower on the Mount of Olives and the summit of
Neby Samwil are conspicuous objects in their midst. To the south-
west is seen the ridge of Beni N’aim, near Hebron, whence Abraham
beheld the smoke of the burning cities of the plain, whilst north of
Olivet is seen the cone-shaped hill of Ophrah. The hills of Samaria
are yet farther to the right, with Tell’Asur—the ancient Baal-
Hazor—Ebal, Gerizim, and Bezek prominent amongst them. Gilboa,
Tabor, and the heights beyond Beisan are visible on a clear day; but
Carmel and Hermon are hidden from view, the former by the inter-
vening heights of Jebel Hazkin, on which stands Bezek, and the lat-
ter by Neby Osh’a. The whole of the Jordan Valley, with the river
itself meandering in serpentlike curves in its midst, lies outspread
like a map at our feet, bathed in sunny verdure in early spring, at
which time of the year Moses appears to have viewed it. From
north to south “ the land of Gilead toward Dan, Naphtali, Ephraim,
and Manasseh—all the land of Judah, toward the utmost sea (the
Mediterranean), the southern hills, and the plain of Jericho” (Deu-
teronomy, xxxiv, 1-3)—all these the aged “servant of God” could
embrace within the compass of his vision without the aid of any
miraculous powers.

Hebron, which we next reach after crossing the Jordan and pass-
ing south by Bethany and Jerusalem, is one of the oldest cities of
the world. It was known at the time of its capture by the Israelites
under Joshua as Kirjath-Arba, which means the “ Fourfold City.”
Probably, like Jerusalem at the present day, it was divided into four
quarters, inhabited respectively by different races of people. The
Septuagint describes it as the “ metropolis of the Anakim.”

It is known as “City of Abraham, the friend of God,” to the
Arabs, who have abbreviated the name to E] Khalif—* The Friend”
or “The Beloved.” It is one of the four sacred cities of the
Moslems.

Haram: Cave of Machpelah. Travelers are not admitted within
the precincts of this mosque, though a few royal European visitors
have been privileged to enter this most cherished Moslem sanctuary
by special Irade of the Sultan. This is one of the “Sacred Sites” of
Palestine, about the genuineness of which there can be little or no
doubt. It is almost certain that the mosque stands over the original
Cave of Machpelah, which was the burial place of Abraham and
Sarah, Isaac and Rebekah, Jacob and Leah. The mosque itself was

*
RUINED CITIES OF PALESTINE—-SUTTON 517

originally a Christian church founded by Justinian in the sixth cen-
tury and completed by the Crusaders. It has, however, been con-
siderably altered by the Moslems. There are six monuments, said to
stand over the spots where the tombs of the six male and female
patriarchs are located in the cave below. The Crusaders, impressed
by the veneration accorded to the Cave of Machpelah by the Arabs,
who claim to be the sons of Ishmael, the son of Abraham by Hagar,
called the place the Castle of St. Abraham.

Hebron was at one time the capital of King David. He made it
the base of his operations against Jerusalem, which in turn became
his royal city. Absalom made it the headquarters of the unsuccess-
ful rebellion against his father. Hebron lost importance after the
Captivity, and in the time of the Romans it was hardly reckoned
as being a Jewish town. The large square stone reservoir, now called
the # Sultan’s Reservoir,” is the Pool of Hebron, where Rechab and
Baanah, the murderers of Ishbosheth, were hanged by David (II
Samuel, iv, 12). There is little else to see in Hebron, with the excep-
tion of the glassworks.

Beit-Jibrin (House of Gabriel) was in the much contested border-
land between the Hebrews and the Philistines. It was known to
the Israelites as Mareshah and was fortified by Rehoboam, who
“built cities for defense, Gath and Mareshah ” (II Chronicles, xi, 8) :

This district was at some time inhabited by people who devoted
an almost incalculable amount of time and trouble to the forma-
tion of great artificial caves. The result of this energy is concen-
trated as in a nucleus in the immediate neighborhood of Beit-
Jibrin. It is difficult to give an account of the principal excava-
tions of this type without appearing to use the language of exag-
geration. Except for their immense size, the Beit-Jibrin caves are
of comparatively small interest. Prof. G. A. Smith (see his en-
trancing volume on the Historical Geography of the Holy Land)
and others adopted the view that the caves as we see them are the
work of the early Christian inhabitants of Palestine, because of
the destruction of Jewish tombs in the course of cutting out the
caves, the various Kufic and Christian inscriptions on the walls,
etc. It was the seat of a Christian bishop as early as the fourth
century. The Crusaders, who were powerfully established at Beit-
Jibrin, which they called Gibelin, beautified one cave by a hand-
some Romanesque doorway.

To sum up the subject of the “ Riddle of the Caves” in the dis-
trict round Beit-Jibrin, there is an innumerable number of artificial
caves. The date of a few of these is later than the Jewish period;
a few others are demonstrably earlier than the end of the Jewish
518 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

monarchy, and there is Scriptural evidence that similar caves exist-
ed at an earlier date still (Judges, vi. 2): “ Because of Midian the
Children of Israel made them the dens which are in the mountains
ancé the caves and the strongholds.” ‘This shows that such artificial
caves were made in the times of the Judges for refuges. Certain
chambers were prepared as cisterns, store chambers, etc. There
is no means of dating such chambers. Other chambers were used
for religious rites, filters, prisons, quarries, traps for wild beasts,
ete.

We next reach Gezer. The site of this famous ancient city had
been forgotten in modern times until about 1870, when Professor
Clermont-Ganneau commenced his research. Biblical records of
the city commence with the time of Joshua. Its king, Horam, helped
Lachish against Joshua’s attack, and he and his army were utterly
annihilated (Joshua x, 33). Gezer was allotted to Ephraim who,
however, failed to drive the Canaanites out (Judges, i, 29). Other
historical sources carry us back to the time of Thothmes III, who
captured it about 1500 B. C., though the excavations prove the
history of Geazer to go hack a further 1,500 years, of which there
is no written history.

Canaanites, Israelites, Arabs, all have successively inhabited the
mound through the centuries. We read in I Chronicles, xx, 4, of
Philistine giants whom David’s men slew at Gezer. The Cansgn
ites lingered on in Gezer until the reign of Solomon. When Solo-
mon celebrated his marriage with the daughter of the King of
Egypt, the Pharaoh “ went up and took Gezer and burnt it with
fire and slew the Canaanites that dwelt in the city, and gave it
for a portion unto his daughter, Solomon’s wife” (1 Kings, ix, 16).

Two tables which have lately been found give evidence of an
Assyrian occupation of Gezer. Gezer had varying fortunes during
the wars of the Jews and the Syrians. About 160 B. C. it was
captured by the Syrians and afterwards recaptured by Simon Mac-
cabzeus, the great high priest, who fortified it, and built himself a
dwelling place, which has lately been discovered. The history of
Gezer stretches on through Roman, Crusader, and Arab periods.

From the excavations we get an idea of the primitive religious
customs which Israel met with, on their entry into Palestine, the
idolatry and the moral abominations, and from the discoveries made
it is easy to see why the worship of the High Place was so fiercely
denounced. The evidence of the wholesale sacrifice of children, the
images found testifying to the licentiousness pervading the whole
worship, the evidences of bodies sawn asunder, and other savageries,
all throw a lurid light on the “iniquity of the Amorite.”

We next reach Jatfa, whence we embark on our way to England.
and thus our delightful tour is brought to an end.

THE UTILIZATION OF VOLCANIC STEAM IN ITALY?

[With 2 plates]

The increased desire for economic independence that accom-
panied the growth of national sentiment during the war has been
shown very clearly in the intensified study and exploitation of nat-
ural resources; and the welkin is still ringing with cries of “ increase
production,” “ back to the land,” and “ keep the home fires burning.”
Examples of this world tendency are apparent everywhere; in cen-
tral Europe, particularly, brown coal, water power, and minerals
have been greatly developed; in tropical countries useful vegetable
products have been increasingly exploited; and in many lands the
rush for petroleum has gathered momentum. Very little, however,
has been heard as yet of attempts to utilize the interior heat of the
earth, which many believe to be one of the most important potential
sources of energy. Only in Italy has a definite and successful effort
been made in this direction, namely, by utilizing the natural steam
which emerges from the earth in volcanic districts. The jets of steam
(“soffioni”) and the pools of water, formed in small craters and
maintained at boiling temperature by natural steam (“lagoni”),
have been known for centuries, but for long were regarded by the
peasants as manifestations of unseen and unfriendly powers. The
discovery in them of boric acid in 1790, the extraction of this acid on
a commercial scale since 1818, and in particular the recent pioneer
work of Prince Ginori Conti, in association with the Societa Boraci-
fera di Larderello, have completely transformed the picture, and re-
vealed a source of wealth which may play an important part, not only
in the future industrial development of Italy, but also in that of
other countries that are blessed—and at times cursed—with volcanic
activity.

The district which has been selected for study and exploitation
forms, roughly, an elliptical area of about 2.5 square miles, lying
south of Volterra and from 40 to 50 miles south-southwest of Flor-
ence. In this part of Tuscany works for generating electrical power
and for producing boric acid and other chemicals have been erected at
Larderello, Castelnuovo, Sasso, Monterotundo, Lago, Lustignano,
Sarrazzano, and to the eastward at Travale. The works are situated
at the bases of hills dividing the valleys of the rivers Cecina and Cor-

1 Reprinted, by permission, from Nature, Jan. 12, 1924.
519
520 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

nia, and the roads are good, though winding. The volcanic nature
of this district is shown by stretches of arid soil, the presence of many
“ soffioni ” and “ lagoni,” and by the occurrence in their vicinity of
sulphur, crystals of calcium carbonate, with pseudomorphous growths
of gypsum, larderellite (ammonium borate), and sassolinite (ortho-
boric acid).

For industrial utilization the supply of steam from “ soffioni” is
not sufficient, and hence bore holes, 16 inches in diameter and from
200 to 500 feet deep, are sunk and protected from caving by iron tub-
ing. The steam issues at an average pressure of 2 absolute atmos-
pheres, and at a temperature varying from 100° to 190° C., friction
against the walls of the bore causing much of the superheat. Recent
drillings have released steam at a considerably higher pressure, and
in quantities up to 60,000 kilograms (59 tons) per hour. At Larde-
rello the actual available output is above 150,000 kilograms per hour
from 135 bore holes, and generally there is abundant evidence of
enormous untapped supplies. The steam, which Prof. R. Nasini has
shown to be radio-active, contains an average of 0.06 per cent of boric
acid, with a maximum of 0.1 per cent, and about 4 to 6 per cent by
weight of gases, mainly carbon dioxide (over 90 per cent), but also
hydrogen sulphide, hydrogen, methane, oxygen, nitrogen, ammonia,
argon, and helium.

The first attempt to produce power from natural steam was made
in 1897 by using it to heat water in a boiler and feeding a recipro-
cating engine with the pure steam. In 1905, Prince Conti fed steam
direct from a “soffione ” into a piston engine, and the result was so
successful that in the following year a larger engine was used, and
the steam generated was made to drive a dynamo for lighting the
works. In 1912 it was decided to erect a 250-kilowatt turbo-generator
to be worked with natural steam, but owing to fear of corrosion of
the turbine blades, and the difficulty of obtaining a good vacuum in
the condensers, on account of the presence of the gases mentioned
above, this intention was abandoned. Intermediate boilers or
evaporators were therefore constructed and used.

The present large power plant at Larderello was first operated in
1916, and comprises evaporators, turbo-generators, condensers, and
transformers. The evaporators employed, until recently, consisted of
vertical aluminum tubes inclosed in a shell of sheet iron; natural
steam circulated round them and the water to be evaporated through
them, this water being taken from the condensers or from that
formed by condensation of the natural steam.

According to a paper which was read by Prince Conti at the
Catania meeting on April 5-11, 1923, of the Italian Association for
the Advancement of Science, this type of evaporator has been re-

placed by another, invented by Signor P. Bringhenti, in which the
dissolved gases (v. s.) are separated from the natural steam, thus
increasing the efficiency of the condensers. The pure steam, super-
heated with the aid of natural steam, is fed at a pressure of 1.25
atmospheres absolute into 3,000-kilowatt turbo-generators of the
Parsons type, of which two are in use and one is kept in reserve.
Each unit has a net efficiency of 2,500 kilowatts, and generates a
3-phase current at 4,000 volts, 50 periods. Step-up transformers of
the self-cooling oil type raise this voltage to 16,000 for distribution to
the various works, and to 32,000 to 38,000 for transmission to Siena
and Florence, Leghorn, Piombino, for use in iron and steel works,
and to the pyrites mines at Massa. The condensers, each with a
cooling area of 11,300 square feet, are placed below the turbines; the
cooling water is driven through the tubes by centrifugal pumps and
thence to the refrigerating towers. Two hydraulic ejectors are
fitted to each condenser, and the condensate is removed by centrifu-
gal pumps. A second power station has recently been erected at
the Lago works for experimental purposes, including work on the
new type of evaporator.

The water containing boric acid is evaporated by natural steam
in shallow lead-lined basins arranged on a slightly inclined plane
and operated on the counter-current principle. When the boric-acid
content has increased to about 8 per cent, the liquid is cooled and
the crude acid, up to 99 per cent purity, is crystallized out. This
acid is then purified by recrystallization. At Larderello there is a
small production of borax from boric acid and sodium carbonate, and
at the Castelnuovo works an output of about 10 tons per day of
ammonium carbonate.

Looking to the future, it appears more than probable that the pro-
duction of power and chemicals with the aid of natural steam will not
long be confined to Tuscany. Already the volcanic districts of
Vesuvius, Etna, and the islands of Eolie (Lipari) are being studied.
Outside Italy like investigations are being pursued in America on
the steam springs of California, Chile, and Bolivia; and attention
will doubtless be given to similar fields in Alaska, New Zealand, and
especially Japan, where such volcanic manifestations are numerous.
To Italy, however, will belong the credit of having initiated this
method of tapping a supply of energy which, in spite of the atten-
tion it has attracted, has been running to waste for centuries, and
thus providing yet another method of “ utilizing the forces of nature
for the benefit of mankind.”

PROPOSED TIDAL HYDROELECTRIC POWER DEVELOP-
MENT OF THE PETITCODIAC AND MEMRAMCOOK
RIVERS?

By W. Rupert TURNBULL, F. R. Ae. 8.

Rothesay, New Brunswick, Canada

[With 1 plate]
HISTORICAL

We should run over first and in a brief manner the tidal develop-
ments and proposals of the past, so that you will be led, as I have
been, to think that the first large tidal development in the world
will probably be carried out at Hopewell, the little village that lies
closest. to the tidal estuaries, the Petitcodiac and Memramcook,
where nature has formed two great natural reservoirs, with the ex-
ception of the dams that must be built to complete them.

Old charters show that tidal power was used in England for
grinding corn as early as the eleventh century and tidal mills have
been in operation for the same purpose from that time to the
present day.

The following extracts are taken from an excellent article by
W. C. Horsnaill that appeared in The Engineer, London:

No record exists showing how the earliest tide wheels were arranged, but.
particulars are available of several mills which were erected in the eighteenth
and nineteenth centuries. In the earlier historic mills no attempts were
made to produce a fall, the power being obtained from the flow of the water
into and out of the pound. To develop power in this way a wheel similar
to the paddlewheels of steamships was used, but with a reversed action; that
is to say, the flow of water drove the wheel. This arrangement entailed the
raising and lowering of the wheel to sait the rise and fall of the tide, as only
the bottom floats could be immersed if the best results were to be obtained.

A corn mill at one time existed at East Greenwich which was driven by
tidal power in the way we have described. The pound had an area of about
4 acres and the wheel measured 11 feet in diameter by 12 feet long. The
power was transmitted by a bevel gear at either end of the water-wheel
shaft, the pinions being free to slide up and down two square vertical
spindles. The water wheel and bevel gears were mounted upon a frame

1Revision of paper read at the professional meeting of the Engineering Institute of
Canada, St. John, New Brunswick, Sept. 11, 1919. Reprinted by permission from the

524 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

which was caused to rise and fall to suit the tides, and the power was trans-
mitted by either bevel wheel according to which way the water wheel was
running, the other bevel pinion being thrown out of gear. By these means the
machinery in the mill was always driven in one direction, in spite of the
reversal of the water wheel at each turn of the tide.

The movable frame, with the water wheel and gear, weighed some 20 tons
and the bottom of it was extended to form a kind of shutter, which filled
up the opening underneath the wheel race, all the water flowing into or out
of the pound being thus compelled to pass through the wheel.

Another type of wheel was devised to overcome the drawback of having
to move up and down with the tide. This wheel was fitted with hinged
floats, which arranged themselves across the stream at the bottom of the
periphery, while they traveled through the water edgeways during the re-
mainder of each revolution. With floats of this type the wheel was fixed,
and the tide gradually rose over it until in some cases complete immersion
took place.

An arrangement of the sluices was also adopted to compel the water to pass
through the wheel in the same direction, whether flowing in or out of the
pound, thus doing away with the need for reversing gear between the water
wheel and the machinery to be driven.

These wheels must have been very inefficient, as the loss of power caused
by the drag of the upper portion when covered was serious, and the design
was soon discarded.

Following these earlier mills came the more recent examples, many ot
which are still in existence, while a few of them may be seen in operation.
The older mills aimed at using the current of water caused by tidal action
and advantage was taken of the flow in either direction. The more modern tide
wheel is arranged to operate with considerable fall, and only develops power
when the water is flowing out of the pound.

The undershot wheel with straight radial floats is usually adopted, and the
mill is started at half ebb or a little later, work being continued for about
five hours, or until the water rises under the wheel and chokes the tail race.
These arrangements give only five hours of working during each tide.

Listing the tidal mills that actually exist, we have a mill at
Woodbridge of 10 to 12 horsepower, one at St. Osyth of 20 horse-
power, and one at Walton-on-the-Naze of 85 horsepower. These
are all small powers, working on a low range of tide and with
only a single, small, natural reservoir that allows of only a partial
use of the tidal power for a comparatively short period of time,
but Mr. Horsnaill shows that if modern turbines were installed at
the plant at Walton-on-the-Naze and the power was used to develop
electricity, instead of grinding corn, it would show up as a com-
mercial development somewhat better than gas power, in spite of
the heavy outlay for storage batteries which would be necessary
at. a plant situated as Walton is.

The number of proposals for tidal plants is very considerable,
and while I think I should not take up your time by discussing all
of them, it is worth while to examine a few of the more serious
ones,
TIDAL POWER—TURNBULL 525

Mr. James Saunders discussed, in the Engineering Review of
London, three great plants for developments in England, viz, at
Chichester Harbor, at the Menai Straits, and in the Bristol Channel.
But in each case either the head of the water was too low or the
cost of forming the artificial reservoirs was too great to make the
proposals commercial at the present time. His most promising
scheme is that for the Bristol Channel, where the tidal head is
quite sufficient for successful operation, but where the cost of form-
ing the great artificial reservoirs that would be here required is
prohibitive in view of the power obtained. The total cost of the
plant figured out at $47,000,000 and the horsepower at 240,000, so
the cost per horsepower would be $196.

C. A. Battiscombe, before London Society of Engineers, also
made a tidal proposal for the Bristol Channel, but his cost works
out at $237 per horsepower; and while neither of these figures
would be too high for commercial developments in some localities,
they are too high to interest English capital, for England is still
a country of cheap coal and in examining any hydroelectric de-
velopment we must constantly keep in mind the cost of power from
other sources.

Mr. Boving has proposed a tidal plant for the River Dee, but no
estimates of costs are given; and coming nearer home, there have
been numerous proposals for obtaining power from the tides at Sack-
ville, at Cape Split, and at the Reversible Falls of St. John.

Now to get continuous power at any of these sites, it would be neces-
sary to form large artificial reservoirs, and the formation of such
reservoirs is so costly that these proposals are not, at present, com-
mercially feasible.

DESIDERATA FOR A TIDAL PLANT

The three great desiderata for a tidal plant are: First, that there
should be sufficient height of tide to obtain a good head; second, that
there should be two natural reservoirs of large size so that continuous
power can be obtained; and, third, that the power plant should be ©
central to the population that would be seryed.

And it is these three desiderata that lead us to suppose that the first
great tidal development in the world will take place at Hopewell.
Here we have two large reservoirs almost completely formed by
nature, we have a tide which is exceedingly regular and that ranks
among the highest tides in the world, with a spring rise of 45 feet,
a neap rise of 38 feet, and a normal neap range of 32 feet, and we
have this power centrally located to a present population of 250,000
who are literally starving for cheap electric power, with no other
hydroelectric developments in sight, except small ones and those that
526 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

are too distant from the centers of population to make their develop-
ment commercial at the present time.

I have examined many other sites for tidal power, in those parts
of the world where the tides are sufficiently high to make tidal power
at all possible, and I am firmly convinced that we have at Hopewell,
the site that is most promising at the present time, from a commercial
standpoint.

HOPEWELL PLANT

To give you some idea of the height of the tide at Hopewell, I will
show some photographs (pl. 1, figs. 1 and 1a) that were taken this
summer of the Government Wharf at Hopewell at high water and at
low water. This wharf, which is 55 feet high, is the only one to reach
low water at ordinary and subnormal neap tides; it does not reach to
low water at spring tides, and all other wharves in the neighborhood
are high-water wharves, and are only reached by the water when the
tide has risen about half its height.

We will now discuss the principle which I have proposed for ob-
taining continuous power from these great tides, and I will draw
your attention to this map of the two tidal estuaries, the Petitcodiac
and the Memramcook rivers (fig. 2). This map shows the general
trend of these rivers, and their confluence at Hopewell, and it also
shows the fresh-water drainage areas of the two rivers—which,
although a minor item as compared to the great volume of salt
water that flows up and down these rivers, should still be borne in
mind in reviewing this proposal.

The dotted lines show the respective drainage areas approximately,
and these have been calculated out to show a drainage basin for the
Petitcodiac of 784 square miles and for the Memramcook of 134
square miles or in the ratio of nearly 6 to1. (The heavy black line
is a county boundary.)

At present the flood tide makes up these rivers for approximately
six hours and then turns and flows back into the bay for six and one-
half hours, and this map also shows the approximate limits of this
flow, above which points the streams are fresh water.

The next (fig. 3) shows a scale chart of the confluence of these two
rivers, at Hopewell, the proposed location of the dams that will be
necessary to control the waters, the depths of water at low tide, etc.

The western dam would be 4,900 feet long, the eastern dam 4,800
feet long, and a wing dam of 900 feet would connect the two, and it
would, of course, be part of the plan to have a highway and trolley
line (operated by the plant) over the tops of these dams connecting
up the two main shores and the long peninsula that makes down be-
tween the two rivers.

This :ighway would only be a matter of local benefit, but it would
be of i..mense benefit to the building up of this locality. At present
Hopewell can only be reached from Coles Head by a little ferry that
can onl, operate for a few hours near high tide; the Petitcodiac is
only bridged at Moncton, 19 miles above Hopewell; the Memramcook
was bridged at Upper Dorchester, 5 miles above Hopewell, but this
bridge is now gone, and the Government is at present making bor-
ings for a bridge to take its place that will cost about $1,000,000.

At present Hopewell, Hillsborough, and the big peninsula are hard
places to get into, and still harder places to get out of, and yet they

are regions of great mineral resources that only require, but still
await, development. The figure shows a lock in the western dam,
through which vessels could be passed at any suitable time of the
tide, on their way up and down the Petitcodiac, and Hillborough and
Moncton would be provided with deep-water harbors instead of the
mud flats which they at present enjoy at every low tide. The gates
of the lock would naturally be swung by electric power furnished
from the near-by power house.

The proposal provides for making the Petitcodiac a high-level
basin in which the water would always be high, and be replenished
at every high tide, while the Memramcook River would be a low-level
528 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

basin to be partially filled from the high-level basin and be always
emptied during the latter part of the ebb tide. This arrangement
would also admirably suit local conditions, for the Memramcook is
exclusively a farming district in which much time and money is at
present expended in excluding the tides by means of dykes, and I have
been informed by farmers of this valley that they would only wish
to have the salt water flood their lands about once in 10 years for
the purpose of fertilizing them. The navigation of this river is prac-
tically nil, so it would hardly be necessary to provide any lock in the
eastern dam—two or three times during a summer a small vessel will

lie at the Dorchester Island wharf for the purpose of discharging
goods, but these could be as well discharged below the dam and the
power company could well afford to pay for the short extra haulage.

I will now call your attention to the next figure (No. 4) which
illustrates—in scheme but not to scale—the principle that I employ
to get continuous power from the tides, with a varying head to be
sure, but with the water always passing through the turbines in the
same direction and always with a head sufficient to make turbine
operation successful. The diagram shows the confluence of the two
rivers, with the necessary dams and gates to control the flow—the
gates J, J, etc., in the western dam would be automatic flap gates open-
ing upstream, allowing the high-level basin (the Petitcodiac) to fill
TIDAL POWER—TURNBULL 529

at every high tide and the gates H, H, etc., of the eastern dam would
be automatic flap gates opening downstream, and allowing the low-
level basin (the Memramcook) to empty on every ebb tide.

The gates G, G, etc., and G1, G+, etc., would be of the nature of
lock gates; they would be operated by electric motors, driven by the
power plant itself, and be under the control of the attendants, who
would open them and close them in accordance with the height of
the external tide at stated times that can be fixed for months in
advance directly from the tide tables.

The power house is represented as a long building, with turbines
T, T+, etc., extending diagonally from the wing dam to the western
dam, and these turbines discharge continuously from the high-level
basin into the common triangular tailrace. Let us now follow
through a cycle of operations from low tide to the following low tide,
remembering that the high-level basin was filled automatically at the
last high tide and that the low-level basin has just been emptied
during the ebb tide through the gates in the eastern dam.
530 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

OPERATION

Beginning with low tide, we may at first leave gates G, G, etc.,
open and allow the water from the tailrace to discharge directly into
the tidal supply (Shepody Bay), but the head will gradually decrease
as the tide rises, and at about 214 hours rise the attendants close
gates G, G, etc., and open gates G', G’, etc., allowing the discharge
from the tailrace to enter the low-level basin; into this the tailrace
will continue to discharge for about 61% hours, or through the last
314 hours of flood tide and through the first 3 hours of ebb tide, after
which time the water in the low-level basin will have so risen, and
the water of the tidal supply will have so dropped, that it will now
be profitable to close gates G', G', etc., and open gates G, G, and
once more allow the discharge to occur directly into the source of
tidal supply and give the low-level basin time to again drain out on
the ebbing tide. I think you will at once grasp from this the sim-
plicity of the system itself, but in order that we should study more
fully one of the engineering problems involved I will call your
attention to the next figure (No. 5), the typical tidal cycle at Hope-
well; this curve shows a copy, in per cent of range plotted against
time, of an actual tidal record, obtained at the ordinary neap tides
by the tide gauge established in 1919 at Hopewell by the Canadian
Tidal Survey, and furnished to me by the courtesy of Mr. H. W.
Jones, of that department. You will note how exceedingly regular
the tide is and how little affected by estuary flow, and this is one of
the great advantages of Bay of Fundy tides in general. At certain
places in the world the diurnal inequality becomes so great that for
several days there is only one tide in 24 hours, and at Southampton
there is a second high water occurring about 2 hours after the first.

In dealing with the question of tidal power at Hopewell we must
remember that although the tide is regular in type, nevertheless the
range of the tide and not the rise is the limiting factor of our power
calculations, and it becomes necessary to establish and work on what
might be called a “standard” range. For this purpose I have
analyzed approximately the ranges that will occur in the course of
a year. I call spring tides those whose range exceeds 42 feet; they
occur about 15 per cent of the time, and I think no attempt should
be made to utilize them especially; I call subnormal neap tides those
whose range is less than 32 feet; they also occur about 15 per cent of
the time, and some means, which are discussed later, would need to
be employed to avoid the impairment of our “standard” amount
of power.

All other tides I call ordinary neap tides, with a range at Hopewell
of 32 feet to 42 feet; they occur about 70 per cent of the time, and
it is the lower range of 32 feet which I think we should adopt as our
TIDAL POWER—TURNBULL 5381

“standard” range, and the curves and estimates that follow are
based on this range of 32 feet.

We will now return to the discussion of the principles involved in
the proposed plant, and I will ask you to examine the next figure
(No. 6), which shows a tidal cycle at a “standard” range of 32 feet,
with an assumed drop in the high-level basin of 6 inches per hour,
and the level changes that will occur in the two basins with the opera-

tion of the plant, as before described. If the conditions at Hopewell
were better, the ratio of effective areas would be as 2 to 1 for the
high and low level reservoirs, but unfortunately this is not the case,
for the Petitcodiac contains an effective area of about 330,000,000
square feet, while the Memramcook has only about 60,000,000 square
feet, so that the ratio is about 514 to 1; thus while the water in the
Petitcodiac is dropping 6 inches per hour the water in the Memram-
cook is rising five and one-half times this, or 33 inches per hour, and
532 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

these level changes are illustrated in the diagram, while the changes
in effective head on the turbines is plotted immediately below.

water, you will note that for 2.35 hours the level of water in the low-
level basin is unchanged, for the water from the tailrace is dis-
charging into the tidal supply direct, but during this time the head is
decreasing from 281% feet to 13814 feet when it becomes expedient to
discharge into the low-level basin, when the head will at once rise to
271% feet.
TIDAL POWER—-TURNBULL joao

After this for 614 hours the low-level basin will rise, but the high-
level basin will also rise after 4.1 hours (as the flood tide will then
be filling it for 1.9 hours) and we have the head decreasing from 2714
feet to 22 feet, but afterwards increasing to 231% at 5.2 hours.

After this the head will gradually decrease to 1314 feet at 9
hours, when, the tide in the external bay having sufficiently ebbed,
the water from the tailrace will be again discharged into it and the
head will steadily rise to its previous maximum of 2814 feet at low
tide, as shown by the curve of heads.

The average head in this case from low tide to low tide works
out at 221% feet.

POWER AVAILABLE

The selection of a 6-inch drop per hour in the high-level basin
is merely for the purpose of an illustration, but other drops may
be considered, and in order to ascertain the most suitable drop for
the initial and final developments (which are referred to later)
we must consider the limits of good turbine operation, with variable
heads, and plot out the gross horsepower curves against various
hourly drops under the conditions, first, of the initial development
(here taken at 90,000 horsepower, and the present basin ratio of
5.5:1) and second, of the final development (here taken at 200,000
horsepower, and the improved basin ratio of 2:1).

These data have been worked out (fig. 6a) for both basin ratios
and the respective areas, and when we select an initial develop-
ment of 90,000 horsepower (which is that indicated by the present
population) we note that this corresponds to an hourly drop in the
high-level basin of 4.4 inches, a minimum head, as per cent of maxi-
mum, of 55 per cent, and a minimum head, as per cent of average,
of 69 per cent. And for a final development of 200,000 horsepower,
with basin ratio improved to 2:1, the hourly drop would be 1014
inches, the minimum head, as per cent of maximum, 56.7 per cent,
and a minimum head, as per cent of average, of 68 per cent. The
actual heads in feet for the two developments are given in Figure 60,
plotted against the time of a complete cycle, and we then have for
a comparative table the following:

It will be noted from horsepower curves (fig. 6a) that up to cer-

basins) the available horsepower increases with an increase in the

mind that as the hourly drop increases the maximum head decreases,
and the minimum head decreases more rapidly still; and we must
therefore select cases, such as has been done in the above table, that
can be successfully met by turbine operation.

TURBINES

The best type of turbines to meet the constantly varying heads of
a tidal plant is open to a considerable amount of discussion, and it
is quite possible that special designs would be required to give really
the best results. However, I have carried out correspondence with

a 2 2 ~~

several turbine manufacturers, and I am assured by them that tur-
bines can be supplied of present design and with high efficiency
that can satisfactorily meet the conditions given in the above com-
parative table.

In correspondence with the I. P. Morris department, of William
Cramp & Sons, Philadelphia, they have recommended a high-speed

536 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

propeller-type turbine (Moody diagonal propeller type), and we
consider this type here to afford a concrete example, the following
data being supplied by the company with special reference to this
particular type of turbine and the Hopewell conditions as to head,

Curves of the horsepower (average head case) and efficiency of

expect a very good average efficiency from this type of turbine.

The above data are tentative, but give a good idea of what can be
done by good low-head turbines, even over a wide range of head
variation. |

INITIAL AND FINAL DEVELOPMENTS

The initial installation called for at the present time by the exist-
ing population would be about 90,000 gross horsepower, and we
note from Fig. 6a that this corresponds to an hourly drop of 4.4
inches in the high-level basin. Now, while the population grew and
the demand for electricity increased from 90,000 upwards, we could
steadily be improving the ratio of the two basins, and thus greatly
improve our power output, up to, say, 200,000 horsepower.

To improve this basin ratio to a better condition, in which the
Memramcook would have half the effective area of the Petitcodiac, I
propose to use electric shovels and an electric tramway, both operated
by surplus power from the initial installation, expropriate, by Goy-
ernment charter, the low-lying farms of the Memramcook Valley
at a fair and equitable rate, and shovel out the basin according to
power requirements, removing the material by the electric railway
and dumping it below the eastern dam, where it would be largely
carried away by the tide, or could be formed into a useful embank-
ment—wharf, railway terminal, or the like.

A cheaper sioe of aiueuie the Memramcook basin might be
to employ hydraulic excavation methods when this basin was being
emptied, the water for this system being pumped when there was
TIDAL POWER—TURNBULL 5387

surplus power from the plant to the high levels that exist on the
peninsula (315 to 570 feet), there stored in reservoirs, and then used
at suitable times, with these high heads, by means of a pipe line to the
parts to be excavated.

TYPE OF DAM

The next figure (No. 7) shows the approximate profile of the
western and eastern dams; since it would not be policy to attempt
to get the extra power that spring tides would give, the western
dam need only have the height of high water, ordinary neap tides,
but the height of the eastern dam would have to be carried up beyond
the highest probable spring tides to insure that the low level basin
was never flooded at high tide. The figure shows this dam carried
3 feet higher than the highest spring tide that occurred during a
period of 15 years. As before mentioned, the tops of the dams
could be utilized as highways and would thus be of invaluable local
benefit, and a light steel structure is indicated on the western dam
for this purpose. The masonry width called for by the calculations
would not be sufficient for a roadway, but a light steel structure
could be winged out on top of the dams and made of sufficient width
to carry a good roadway, an electric tram, and the power-transmis-
sion lines that would go both west to St. John and east to Halifax.

The flap gates for filling the high-level basin and emptying the
low-level basin are indicated in the sketch profile. They should
present no engineering difficulties, but they should be designed of
sufficient size to readily pass the full volume of water required by
the final and maximum development.

We now come to the question of the river bottom and the location
of rock for a good dam foundation, and I regret that I can not give
any exact data. In the summer of 1919 I went twice to Hopewell,
but could only obtain indirect evidence as to the depth of the rock
under the muddy beds of the two rivers. The full line of the pro-
file shows the depth of the top of the mud, according to the Admir-
alty chart, and there is strong presumptive evidence that the top of
the rock does not lie more than 15 to 20 feet below this.° Where the
“new wharf” was built at Hopewell the mud soon washed out for a
depth of 12 feet, when hard bottom was reached, and the outcropping
of ledge rock at the mouth of the Memramcook, as shown on the
chart and profiles, indicates the rock bottom for a quarter of a mile
is very near the surface. The shores at Hopewell, Fort Folly Point,
and Coles Head are all rocky, and the nature of all rock in this
locality is the same, viz, shaley sandstone to pure sandstone sufli-
ciently sound for making grindstones.*

2The water-power branch of the Dominion Government is to make borings and other
investigations at the site of the proposed dam this coming summer (1924).

TIDAL POWER—TURNBULL 539

As to the best typé of dam to build at Hopewell, I feel that I
should offer no opinion, for the question of dam design is an engi-
neering specialty, and only an expert in this particular branch of en-
gineering could decide the best type to adopt, and he only after a
systematic line of borings were obtained along a proposed site. It
has been suggested to me that a dam composed of hollow sections of
concrete is a satisfactory and cheap type to build, the sections being
built in a dry dock, floated into position, and then sunk by filling the
interior with rock and gravel. However, I doubt if this is a well-
proven system, and, as I say, the question of best type should ,be
decided by an expert of long experience. Such estimates of cost that
I have been able to make have been based on the cyclopean concrete
type of dam. In considering the best type to build at Hopewell the
question of the tidal currents would have to be considered, and while
these currents are not very swift, when the great height of the tide
is considered, nevertheless they should receive attention. From
Figure 5 you will note some current measurements that I made by
using a ship’s log attached to an anchored boat. When the tidal
range was 388 feet the channel current reached a maximum of 4.2
knots, and you will note that although the flood current soon dies
out the ebb persists at near its maximum until almost the time for
the next flood tide to begin. Out of the channel the current runs
swiftly for much shorter periods, and the tidal current makessshore-
ward as the shores are approached until we often have currents at
right angles to the main stream. The dotted curve shows some meas-
urements taken rather off the channel, with a tidal range of 28 feet,
and the maximum under these conditions was 2.6 knots.

SPECIAL PROBLEMS

Before leaving the engineering problems that are presented by
this novel plant, I will mention three other items that should _be
considered.

The question of subnormal neap tides requires especial attention,
for while my calculations are based on the least range, viz, 32 feet
of ordinary neap tides, nevertheless there are certain tides which
occur sometimes three days a month, sometimes five days a month,
and sometimes not at all in a month, which have a lower range than
32 feet, and may sometimes have a range as low as 25 feet.

Now, if our plant were built and running at full capacity, with
a range of 32 feet, there would be an impairment of the regular
capacity whenever these subnormal neaps occurred, which is about
15 per cent of the time, and I think some provision should be made
to deal with them adequately. One method might be to keep the
turbines and generators well ahead of the normal demand and use
these extra ones only during the subnormal neaps; another method
would be to keep the Memramcook shoveled out, as already described,
540 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

well ahead of the future requirements and thus improve the average
head; and yet another method would be to build a fresh-water dam,
say, just below Turtle Creek, about 5 miles west of Moncton, in
which fresh water would be impounded and released only to make
up the deficiency in head at subnormal neaps. Still another method
would be to employ auxiliary steam power to assist the water power
during the water deficiency. One of the last two devices is nearly
always resorted to in the case of ordinary hydroelectric plants sit-
uated on fresh-water rivers. In nearly all districts the amount of
rainfall varies enormously during the different months of the year
and the amount of run-off and discharge varies in a direct relation
to the rainfall. As an example of this, the discharge at Grand Falls,
on the St. John River, reached a maximum in May, 1909, fifty times
greater than the maximum of October, 1909, and the mean discharge
for the whole month of May was twenty times greater than the mean
for October. In fresh-water rivers a certain power may run into
thousands of horsepower in the spring, but be reduced to hundreds
in the fall of the year, unless adequate means are resorted to to in-
crease the deficiency of head.

In this matter a tidal power scores heavily over a fresh-water
power. In the case of the fresh-water power neither the time nor
quantity of a head deficiency can be predicted, but with a tidal
power both the time and the deficiency are predicted by the tide
tables several years in advance, and it would thus be much easier to
provide for our head deficiency, which only, after all, amounts to 35
per cent in quantity and occurs only 15 per cent of the total time.

The best means of making up the deficit in the case of the Hopewell
tidal plant would be best figured out in the final estimates as that one
which would maintain the normal output at a minimum of cost.

The other two engineering items I wish to discuss are sediment
and ice.

At the present time the never-ceasing current flow up and down
the two rivers keeps the river stirred up, and the waters of both
rivers show a considerable amount of sediment, and one would at
first jump to the conclusion that this muddy grit, fine though it is,
would produce much unusual wear on the turbines. However, what
will happen as soon as the mouth of the Petitcodiac is closed by a
dam? The mud in the water above the dam will undoubtedly settle,
for it will have time to do so, and the water of the Petitcodiae will
become clear. At preserft the water is never still, but with a dam the
rise and fall would be reduced to a few feet and the current would
be sluggish.

In a similar way the building of the dam would entirely alter the
ice conditions. Once the dam was built, the whole river would freeze
over in severe weather and the sheet of ice would rise and fall with

the water, just as it does in the St. John and similar rivers. Never-
theless, while the building of the dam was in progress the question
of large masses of ice moving with the current should be given every
attention, and quite likely some special method of cushioning the
blows from ice might have to be devised.

POWER DISTRIBUTION

We will now turn to a consideration of the method of distributing
the power available at Hopewell, and I will ask you to examine the
next figure (No. 8) and note how centrally Hopewell is placed with
reference to the centers of population of both New Brunswick and
Nova Scotia.

The method of transmission carries with it no special problems,
as we would undoubtedly use step-up transformers at the power
house, transmit at about 66,000 volts with three-phase current, and
use step-down transformers at the delivery points. All this system
has been so thoroughly thrashed out, and is in daily use all over
Canada and under Canadian winter conditions, that it has become
practically “standard” and needs no special consideration here.
The principal feature that should be considered in laying out the
transmission lines would be one of expediency and proper return on
the capital outlay of transmission lines and line losses. Undoubt-
edly a main line should go west to St. John, with power for all inter-
vening towns and villages of any size, and undoubtedly a main line
should go east and south to Halifax with power for Sackville,
Springhill, Amherst, Truro, etc.; and also undoubtedly branch lines
should go to Moncton, New Glasgow, and Stellarton, as the present
population would warrant this. The extension of branch lines to
St. Stephen, Fredericton, Newcastle, and Chatham is somewhat
doubtful at present, but there are railways that well might be eco-
nomically electrified toward all these points, and I have therefore
included them in the preliminary estimate. I have prepared a table
of the population that would be served by these lines, and the total
works out at 250,000 inhabitants. With this as a basis, we should
now estimate the probable per capita use and thus obtain an estimate
of the proper size of plant for the initial development at Hopewell.

THE MARKET

When I prepared my first report on this subject it was submitted
to the well-known firm of Sanderson & Porter, of New York—a firm
who specializes in the control and management of some 60 hydro-
electric developments—and their condensed criticism was as follows:

We think your proposal from an engineering standpoint is sound and it is
the only scheme for utilizing tidal power that seems practical, but we are rather
TIDAL POWER—TURNBULL 543

in doubt as to whether the population served is sufficiently large to warrant
the capital expenditure. :

Now, this was in 1914, and I presume Sanderson & Porter based
their opinion on the per capita use of hydroelectric power in the
United States, which works out at 0.10 horsepower per inhabitant,
according to the textbooks.

Since then, however, newer data have come to my hand, and if
these data are accurate, as I presume they are, the complexion of
affairs has changed and the Hopewell plant is a really good com-
mercial proposition at the present time and needs only the govern-
mental help accorded by a good charter.

The data that I speak of were published in Saturday Night about
February, 1919, and are contained in a very interesting table
which shows the per capita use of hydroelectric power for every
Province of Canada and for the Dominion as a whole. It shows that
British Columbia uses 0.36 horsepower per capita; Ontario, 0.288;
Quebec, 0.267; and the whole of Canada, 0.206, and these figures are
for the total population, and they should be increased at least 30 per
cent for the per capita use of population served. It will thus be
seen that Ontario, per capita served, is using about 0.87 and Quebec
about 0.35, and I think we may properly assume that 0.36 would be
used by the inhabitant of the Maritime Provinces as soon as you
could give him really cheap electricity.®

On this basis, then, the population of 250,000 would require 90,000
gross horsepower, or, say, 45,000 horsepower at the delivery points;
and I think the initial development at Hopewell should be for 90,000
horsepower,* with every provision made for increasing the output
as already outlined in this paper up to 200,000 gross horsepower, as
the population and demand increased, as they undoubtedly would
when cheap power was available. |

COSTS

We now turn to the question of costs, and I have made an estimate
of this as follows and in accordance with the textbooks on the
subject:

Dam cost in cyclopean concrete
Western dam:

730 lineal feet, at equivalent height of 38 feet and $210 per

3The latest data show that since this was written (1919) the per capita use in
Canada of hydropower has increased 22% per cent and it is steadily increasing.

use,

Since we will remain uncertain about the dam cost until borings
are made, it will be best to allow $4,000,000 in our preliminary esti-
mates.®

The other items of cost can be more accurately estimated from the
known cost of equipment in existing hydroelectric developments, and
we have the following table of total estimated cost:

The cost for subsequent development is much less, relatively, for in
the initial development full allowance has had to be made for the
final development in all items except turbines, generators, and trans-
mission lines and the cost of a full development of 200,000 gross
horsepower would work out at about $20,000,000, or $100 per gross
horsepower. In this estimate for final development the cost of shov-
eling and dredging the Memramcook farming lands—which would be
necessary as previously shown—is not figured, for it would be un-
doubtedly good policy to start this work as soon as the power house
was in operation and take the necessary cost out of the annual income.

To ascertain whether a hydro proposal is “commercial,” it is
necessary, for any given locality, to compare the cost of developed
horsepower with the cost of steam coal in the locality considered.
and this relation for the Maritime Provinces is shown in Figure 9.
In January, 1914, the wholesale price of steam coal was $4.50 per
long ton (at St. John, New Brunswick), and at that time and rate per
ton for coal it was a paying proposition to develop a water power

5 Another method of obtaining approximate cost for dams was figured as follows:
Approximate volume of all dams—465,000 cubic yards, less allowance for gates—=70,000
eubic yards; net for dams=395,000 cubic yards. With concrete at $10.50 per cubic
yard, total cost of dams—$4,150,000,
TIDAL POWER—TURNBULL 545

for $132 per horsepower (this is an average figure for-seven American
developments)—at the present time the wholesale price of steam
coal at St. John, New Brunswick, is $8.68 per long ton, and it would
thereiore now be a paying proposition to develop a water power in
this part of the world at the rate of $255 per developed horse power,
as shown in Figure 9.

According to my estimate of cost above, the initial development at
Hopewell should be done for about $155 per horsepower, and the
final development for about $100 per horsepower; and while the
borings to be made this summer may determine the rock bottom at a

Fic. 9

somewhat lower level than that assumed for my estimate, neverthe-
less the Hopewell plant should be a commercial one, even if the cost
of the dams works out more than double my estimate. The other
items of the estimates can be and have been taken direct from the
data on standard fresh-water developments, and should therefore
be approximately right, as given above.

If the Maritime Provinces were blessed with great fresh-water
powers, such as exist in Quebec and Ontario, the time might hardly
be ripe for the development of this tidal plant, but, to quote from the
Commission of Conservation’s book (1911), it says, in speaking of
New Brunswick, “The larger rivers for the most part are long and
their fall is gradual;” and again, “There are comparatively few
546 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

lakes in the upper portions of the watersheds of the majority of the
rivers, and hence little facility is offorded for the natural storage of
waters for the purpose of equalizing the flow during the low-water
periods.” ‘To emphasize this point I refer to the diagram, Figure 10,
which shows the comparative power available at Hopewell, all fresh-
water powers in New Brunswick, Grand Falls (the largest single
fresh-water power), and Musquash (the first public development in
the Province)—these are all on a 24-hour basis.

Nova Scotia is similarly placed as regards fresh-water powers, and
the total estimate for the Province is only 128,000 horsepower; there-

Fic. 10

fore the single plant at Hopewell would be almost equal to the com-
bined fresh-water powers of the two Provinces.

Were we able to harness the power that is daily wasted in the two
great eastern arms of the Bay of Fundy we could have the use of
3,500,000 horsepower, but this is a dream for the future and is not
a practical proposition for to-day. The theory of the thing is the
same as for the Hopewell plant, but the execution and cost would be
impossible at present.

The Hopewell plant is to-day a good commercial proposition.
Special engineering problems are attached to it, but they are only
those that attach to any special plant. The difficulties are small in
comparison to many recent engineering works that have been success-
fully carried out, and I trust that the near future will see this great
plant in daily operation.

MISS OLIVE EDIS. F. R. P. S.

SIR JAMES DEWAR, F.R.S., LL. D.
SIR JAMES DEWAR, F.R.S., LL. Ds
By Sir JAMES CricHTON-Browng, M. D., LL. D., F. R. S.

[With 1 plate]

A great man of science has passed away, resolved into that at-
mosphere the secret of which he has done so much to disclose. Sir
James Dewar died on March 27 at the Royal Institution in Albe-
marle Street, which has been for 46 years the scene of his labors;
and his remains were, by his express wish, cremated at Golder’s
Green on the following Saturday.

Born at Kincardine-on-Forth under the shadow of the Ochill
Hills, and near Stirling with all its romantic historical associations,
on September 20, 1842, Sir James Dewar was reared in a Presby-
terian home and was early introduced to the austere theology in the
Shorter Catechism. In his tenth year there occurred an incident
which probably colored his hfe. While skating on a winter’s day he
fell through the ice, and when rescued walked about in his wet clothes
till they were dry, so that his family might not learn of his misad-
venture. The result of that was that he had a severe attack of
rheumatic fever, which crippled him for two years and left him with
a damaged heart. The heart trouble incapacitated him for the
active life to which he had been previously disposed and permanently
cut him off from strenuous games and exercises, but in no degree
impaired his constitutional energy, which remained intact and un-
surpassable till his death. It was in these two years when he was
laid aside, free from schooling, with only a modicum of private
tuition and cut off from the companionship of other boys of his
age, that his native gifts had a favorable opportunity of spontaneous
growth. He browsed unconfined on the wholesome pastures of
English and Scottish literature, drank deeply of Burns, and above
all, began to think for himself and to create; and creation is the
essence of all genius. Always devoted to music, he had before his
illness attained to some degree of proficiency on the flute, but was
now debarred from that instrument by breathlessness, and so turned
to the violin. With the help of the village joiner he made for him-
self several violins, one of which, wonderfully expressive in its tones,
was played on at the celebration of his golden wedding in 1921.

548 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1928

When 12 years old Dewar, still a pale and delicate boy, went to
the Dollar Academy, a Scottish secondary school of high repute, of
which he always spoke very gratefully, and there he resumed the
ordinary routine of the education of the period. It was a little
incident at Dollar, the discovery in the garden of Mr. Lindsay, the
master with whom he was boarded, of an old and half-buried sundial,
in the erection and orientation of which he took some part, that in-
oculated him with a taste for exact science; but it was not until he
went to the University of Edinburgh, at the age of 17, that his ap-
prenticeship to science really began. There he soon diverged from
the accustomed literary course and plunged, as it were instinctively,
into mathematics, physics, and chemistry. In this congenial element
his ability was speedily recognized by two of his professors, Guthrie
Tait and Lyon Playfair, the latter of whom made him his class as-
sistant. There was great intellectual activity in Edinburgh while
Dewar’s lot was cast there in the sixties of last century, and into that
he entered with zest and with an acceptance not usually accorded to
so young a man. His teaching power attracted large classes to his
practical demonstrations, and the experimental tendencies, which
were in the marrow of his bones, unmistakably displayed themselves,
leading Lyon Playfair to suggest to him that he should accept an
appointment for technical work in connection with the dyeing in-
dustry with which his friend Crum Brown, who became Playfair’s
successor, was, by family ties, associated. Had Dewar adopted this
course Perkins might have been anticipated, but he preferred to re-
main in Edinburgh to carry on his less circumscribed researches
there, in the meantime, however, enlarging the scope of his studies
by a sojourn at Ghent, where under Kekuli he gave special atten-
tion to organic chemistry.

Returning to Edinburgh as demonstrator of chemistry in the uni-
versity, he engaged, with Guthrie Tait, in experiments with Crookes’s
newly invented radiometer, and with McKendrick in an inquiry on
the physiological action of light. From the university he passed to
the Dick Veterinary College as professor of chemistry, and it was
while diligently working there that an offer of promotion unex-
pectedly came to him. There was a vacancy in the Jacksonian pro-
fessorship at Cambridge, for which there were several candidates,
and a selection was imminent, but at this moment the late Sir George
Humphrey visited Edinburgh as an examiner in the medical faculty
and was introduced to Dewar. With keen discernment he took his
measure and immediately telegraphed to Doctor Porter, then tutor,
afterwards master of Peterhouse, “ Hold your hand, I have found
the man.” At the same time Guthrie Tait wrote to Cambridge in-
dicating Dewar, and that settled the matter, and the post was of-
SIR JAMES DEWAR—CRICHTON-BROWNE 549

fered to him by telegram. He was busy and happy, a brilliant career
in Edinburgh, almost inevitably culminating in a professorship, was
opening out before him; but his young wife, with sure intuition,
felt that he deserved a wider field than Scotland could afford, and so
the die was cast, and the migration to Cambridge took place.

It would not be correct to say that Dewar found himself in a
congenial element in Cambridge at that time. His lectures were
an unprecedented success; he made some lifelong friends, of whom
one, Professor Liveing, much loved and venerated, still happily
survives, but some bristles of the Scottish thistle adhered to him,
and chemistry and physics had not then come to their own on the
banks of the Cam. He had not even such facilities as he had en-
joyed in the north. His laboratory was a small room, without a
fireplace and badly hghted; apparatus was conspicuous by its
absence; and his aspirations, very forcibly expressed, were not very
sympathetically received. It was, therefore, with satisfaction that
he found himself translated to a more elastic atmosphere when in
1877 he was elected Fullerian professor of chemistry at the Royal
Institution in succession to Dr. John Hall Gladstone.

It was in the laboratories of the Royal Institution during his
incumbency of the Fullerian professorship that all Dewar’s tri-
umphs were achieved, more especially those in connection with
the liquefaction of gases and the properties of matter at tempera-
tures approaching the absolute zero. Faraday, the god of his
idolatry in all scientific affairs, had led the way in this explora-
tion and had by means of low temperature and pressure succeeded
in liquefying all the then known gases except nitrogen, oxygen,
and hydrogen, and the compound gases—carbonic oxide, marsh gas,
and nitric oxide—and as early as 1874 Dewar was fascinated by the
subject, as evidenced by his lecture before the British Association
on “Latent heat of liquid gases.” In 1878 he showed Cailletet’s
apparatus in operation in England. It was, however, the suc-
cess of Wroblewski and Olsyewski, of Cracow, in liquefying oxygen
in 1884 that withdrew him from his earlier preoccupation, with
the heat of the sun, electrophotometry, and the chemistry of the
electric arc, and supplied the stimulus to his more memorable dis-
coveries. In 1885 he was able to show a profoundly moved audience
at the Royal Institution the air we breathe made visible as a clear
liquid, compressed to one eight-hundredth of its bulk and_pro-
duced at a temperature of —192° C. In 1893 came oxygen in a
solid state, an ultramarine ice produced at —216° C., and in 1897
fluorine as a fluid. In the following year appeared liquid hydrogen,
and in 1899, a crowning close of the century, that gas in a solid
state at a temperature of —260°, or about 13° above the point of
550 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

absolute zero, that unplumbed depth where molecular movement is
no more. Helium alone remained unsubjugated by Dewar, and
that he would unquestionably have liquefied had not Onnes, of
Leyden, working on his lines, accomplished the feat while he was
preparing for it.

Now that liquid air is an article of commerce, Dewayr’s liquid-
air work has become popular knowledge, but only an expert who
has essayed such an enterprise can conceive the patience, the indus-
try, the ingenuity, the constructive genius required in it. Dewar
devoted to it years of unremitting toil and pursued it not without
risk to life and limb, and sometimes embarrassed by the question
of ways and means to carry on so costly a campaign. To obtain a
degree of cold suflicierit to liquefy hydrogen by means of internal
work done by the molecules while a gas was being forced through
a porous plug, involved the building up of a machine capable of
sustaining pressure in many tons to the square inch, even at a tem-
perature of —260° C., and fitted together with a nicety and pre-
cision of which even first-class engineering knows little. To pro-
tect the liquid gases when produced against the influx of heat,
special measures were necessary, and the search for these led to the
invention of the vacuum bulb, the parent of the thermo flask which
Dewar’s nimble brain devised, which must have brought him a
huge fortune had he chosen to patent it, and which, if properly
designated, should keep his name alive for ever, even amongst the
masses of mankind. But the vacuum bulb, even when silvered, was
not enough. In order to examine the liquefied gases in a static
condition, and unevaporated for long periods, specially high vacua
were needed, and these were procured by Dewar’s utilization of the
absorptive power of carbon. “ The discovery of the marvelous power
of charcoal to absorb gases at low temperature,” says Professor
Armstrong, “ will render the period 1900 to 1907 ever memorable.”

Dewar’s liquefied gases, thus obtained, became themselves instru-
ments of research, and enabled him to conduct novel and illumina-
tive investigations on electrical conductivity, thermo-electric powers,
magnetic properties, and electric constants of metals and other sub-
stances at low temperatures and on the effects of extreme cold on
chemical and photographic action. Having established that chemi-
cal changes are almost quite inhibited at temperatures about 300° F.
below zero, Dewar, with the assistance of Professor Macfadyen,
determined to test how far vital processes were affected by the same
conditions. A typical series of bacteria was employed for the pur-
pose, possessing varying degrees of resistance to external agents.
The bacteria were first simultaneously exposed to the temperature
of liquid air for 24 hours. In no instance could any impairment of
their vitality be detected in either growth or functional activity.
SIR JAMES DEWAR—CRICHTON-BROWNE 562

This was strikingly illustrated in the case of the phosphorescent
organisms. Their cells emit light which is apparently produced by
chemical processes of intracellular oxidation, and the phenomenon
ceases with the cessation of their activity. These organisms, there-
fore, furnished a crucial test of the influence of low temperature
on vital manifestations, and when cooled down in liquid air they
immediately became nonluminous, but, on being thawed, the lumi-
nosity as speedily returned. In further experiments the organisms
were subjected to the temperature of liquid air for seven days. The
results were again nil, for on thawing they renewed their life proc-
esses with undiminished vigor. The organisms were next, exposed
to the temperature of liquid hydrogen—only 28° above the absolute
zero—and again the results were nil. The fact that life can continue
to exist at a temperature at which, according to our present con-
ception, molecular action ceases and the entire range of chemical
and physical activities, with which we are acquainted, either ceases
or enters on an entirely new phase, affords ground for reflection, as
to whether, after all, life is dependent for its continuance on chemi-
cal reactions.

Dewar’s heroic attempts to reach the absolute zero of temperature,
solving problems of supreme importance and intricacy by the way—
time-and-strength-consuming though they were—did not exhaust
his scientific energies or complete his conquests. As a member of the
Explosives Commission in 1888, in conjunction with Sir Frederick
Abel, he invented cordite, which became the standard smokeless
powder, and during the war he contrived a light and portable ap-
paratus for the conveyance of oxygen so that it might be available
as a protection against mountain sickness for men going up in air-
planes. He conjured up giant soap bubbles that survived for months,
because the air inflating them was like Bonny Kilmenny, “as pure
as pure can be,” and spread out films of extreme tenuity that in
their stream lines and vortex motion yielded to his manipulations,
assemblages of dancing rainbows of exquisite beauty. He took part
in many inquiries bearing on the public health and especially on the
safeguarding and improvement of our water supply, and was a
much sought and inexorable witness before committees of Lords
and Commons. Along with Professor Liveing, he conducted an
elaborate series of studies on spectroscopy that have now been col-
lected in a volume, and would by themselves place him in the first
rank as a man of science.

Besides doing his own work, Dewar was the cause of much work
in others. He was eminently suggestive and freely helpful to all
who sought his assistance. He did not suffer fools gladly, and was
intolerant of pretentious mediocrity; but for the earnest student and
552 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

honest worker he had unfailing sympathy and encouragement. The
fruits of his experience and the seeds of his speculations—and_hy-
potheses of the right sort are valuable commodities in science—were
always at the service of those who consulted him. And it is certain
that ideas which he thus flashed forth have afterwards, without
acknowledgment, materialized in profitable inventions.

Dewar identified himself with the Royal Institution and the Royal
Institution became identified with him. He pervaded it so that
many of its habitués entering it now feel as if the soul had gone out
of it. The scene of his labors became the object of his affections,
and he never spared himself in its service. Proud of its traditions,
and conscious of the opportunities it had afforded him, he strove
to enhance its reputation and extend its usefulness. He made liberal
benefactions to its funds, and was wont to enlarge on the magnitude
of its accomplishment with the very meager means at its disposal,
pointing out that the fundamental ideas and experiments on which
are based the stupendous chemical and electrical industries of to-day
were worked out in its laboratories by Davy, Faraday, Tyndall, and
himself at an average expenditure on research of £1,000 a year.

During his period of office at the Royal Institution Dewar deliv-
ered 238 lectures in all—49 Friday evening discourses, 48 Christmas
lectures, and 151 afternoon lectures. As his lectures were no off-
hand demonstrations, but carefully prepared expositions, every
experiment being previously rehearsed, they entailed a heavy drain
on his time and energy. In the 10 years—1884 to 1893—he delivered
six of those Christmas courses of lectures to juveniles, which make
peculiarly exacting demands on minute attention and lucid expres-
sion, dealing with subjects as varied as “Alchemy,” “ Meteorites,”
“ The air,” “ Clouds and cloudland,” “ Frost and fire,” “ Light and
photography.” It was by the allurements held out by him that the
late Dr. Ludwig Mond was induced to make to the Royal Institu-
tion the munificent gift of the Davy Faraday Research Laboratory,
which affords unique opportunities to those individual and inde-
pendent investigators on whom Dewar’s hopes for the advancement
of science were mainly fixed.

Dewar had a singularly impressive and attractive personality.
He had a head like Shakespeare, a countenance finely chiseled, ex-
pressive of vivid intellect and abounding vim blended with good
humor. He gave the world “assurance of a man,” a strong true
man, open hearted and open minded, quick of temper perhaps,
but genial and generous withal, a staunch friend, a delightful com-
panion. With a proper endowment of the ingenitwm perfervidum
Scotorum, he was sturdy in spirit, intrepid in manner, fearless,
patriotic, and given to hospitality. No one could be more inimical
SIR JAMES DEWAR—CRICHTON-BROWNE 553

than he to the occult in all its phases, and yet the press has been
not altogether wrong in ascribing to him a certain wizardry— the
wizard of Albemarl Street” they have called him—for he was a
wonder-worker and threw a spell over his audience. Bent on the
pursuit of reality and on the control of nature through the advance-
ment of knowledge, there was scope in the amplitude of his mind
for ideal values. He had imagination, which is the forerunner of
science, “the vision and the faculty divine,” and was a connoisseur
in music and the fine arts. On the bookshelves in his study, within
reach from his easy chair, were assembled well-worn copies of the
essays of Montaigne, Elia, and Emerson; the poems of Hardy, Walt
Whitman, Rossetti, and Meredith; Landor’s Imaginary Conver-
sations; Carlyle’s Heroes; Sesame and Lilies, and the Cricket on
the Hearth.

Dewar was knighted in 1904, and that was the only and wholly
inadequate recognition offered to him by his country, to which he
brought honor and profit. But foreign countries and learned bodies
were more appreciative of his merits than the dull-witted ministers
at home. The royal and philosophical societies and academies of
Rome, Belgium, New York, Philadelphia, Frankfort, Milan, and
Copenhagen were proud to inscribe his name on their rolls, and all
the four Scottish universities, as well as those of Oxford, Dublin,
Brussels, and Christiania, conferred on him honorary degrees. The
Royal Society awarded him its Copely, Rumford, and Davy medals,
and he was president of the British Association in 1902.

Sir James Dewar married in 1871, Helen Rose, daughter of Mr.
William Banks, of Edinburgh, and she survives him. Never had
savant a more propitious spouse. Lady Dewar entered keenly
into all her husband’s interests, sustained him in his heavy
tasks, and created the first scientific salon in London. There are
few noted people in the world of science who have not attended
the receptions in her drawing room at the Royal Institution after
lectures there.

J. C. KAPTEYN, 1851-1922 2
By A. VAN MAANEN

[With 1 plate]

In Amsterdam, on June 18, Jacobus Cornelius Kapteyn, since
1921 retired professor of astronomy and director of the astronomical
laboratory at Groningen, died at the age of 71 years. In him astron-
omy loses one of its foremost pioneers.

Kapteyn was born January 19, 1851, at Barneveld, a small village
where his father had a well-known boarding school. Of the 15
children of this family, several became leaders in the scientific world
in Holland. From 1869 to 1875 Kapteyn was a student at the Uni-
versity of Utrecht, where his principal teachers were Buys Ballot and
Grinwis, so that it is no wonder that his doctoral thesis was in phy-
sics: “ Onderzoek der Trillende Platte Vliezen.” Just at this time,
however, the position of observer at the Leiden Observatory was
vacant, and Kapteyn applied for and obtained the position. By this
accidental circumstance astronomy secured the privilege of counting
Kapteyn as one of its workers and before long as one of its foremost
leaders. His ability was soon recognized, and at the age of 27, which
for Holland is extremely young, he was appointed full professor in
astronomy at the University of Groningen. On entering office, Feb-
ruary 20, 1878, his opening address had as subject: “'The parallax of
the fixed stars.” 7

The problem of the stellar distances was naturally of first impor-
tance to him, whose ideal was to throw some light on the structure
of the universe. We do not know when this idea began to ripen in
' Kapteyn’s mind, but it probably dates from the time that he decided
to devote his life to astronomy. And no better man could be found
to push astronomy ahead along these lines, because Kapteyn had
two qualities which were needed for such investigations: He could
grasp a great problem and at the same time both could and was
willing to devote much time to essential details. These two qualities
show up through all his life, and we see him, never losing view of the
greatest of astronomical problems, the structure of the universe, and
at the same time working with painstaking assiduity to develop and
improve the methods of securing the necessary data. Of this part
of his work no better example can be given than the succession of new
methods that he developed to obtain stellar distances. In 1882 the

556 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

parallaxes of only 34 stars were known, the best results being due to
heliometer observations, especially by Gill and Elkin at the Cape of
Good Hope.

When Kapteyn came to Groningén his appointment was to the
professorship in astronomy, calculus of probabilities, and theoretical
mechanics, but he found no observatory at his disposal. Good mathe-
matician as Kapteyn was, his heart was drawn more toward the
practical side of his science, and during the first years in Groningen
he tried hard to secure funds for an observatory, with a 6-inch helio-
meter as its principal instrument. In the beginning his efforts seemed
to promise success, and ground for the observatory was bought a little
outside of the city, but funds for the erection of the buildings were
not forthcoming until many years later, by which time Kapteyn in his
unique astronomical laboratory had founded an establishment which
satisfied, better than an observatory could have done, the needs of
this wonderful combination of the practical and the theoretical
astronomer.

Lack of an opportunity for observational work was, however,
keenly felt by Kapteyn during the early years of his professorship,
and he requested Prof. H. G. van de Sande Bakhuyzen to let him use
the meridian circle of the Leiden Observatory during his vacations.
The request was granted and Kapteyn planned a careful program for
the observation of stellar parallaxes; he introduced the differential
method of observations in right ascension, thus deriving parallaxes
for 15 stars, which in accuracy competed with those yielded by the
heliometer, while the observations required less time. His thorough
discussion of the method and of these observations in Volume VII of
the Annals of the Leiden Observatory is one of the many contributions
from his hand which will be recorded among the classics of astronomy.

But it was clear that for a solution of his great problem parallaxes
must be determined more rapidly. In 1889, at the conference of
the Carte du Ciel, Kapteyn outlined an ingenious scheme for meas-
uring the parallaxes of a large number of stars by means of photog-
raphy. The plan is extremely simple in theory: On the same plate
three exposures are made at the epoch of maximum parallactic dis-
placement; half a year later, at the minimum, six other exposures
are made on the same plate, and three again at the following maxi-
mum; after development the plate shows 12 images of each star
which in practice are arranged as follows:

The distances @ and } are then measured and reduced by a simple
process; and yield, with respect to the mean parallax of all the stars
measured, the parallax of every star visible on the plates. The
method was put into practice by Kapteyn and Donner and the first
results were published in 1900 as No. 1 of the Publications of the
Astronomical Laboratory at Groningen, a remarkable series of pub-
lications which has contributed much to the development of astron-
omy in the last 20 years.

While similar results for different fields, mostly in collaboration
with De Sitter, appear in the Groningen Publications, we soon per-
ceive a change in his policy of attack on the general problem. ‘The
change from parallaxes to proper motion, however, is more apparent
than real, and is founded on the practical fact that by using the
proper motions we can base the parallaxes on the ever-increasing
base line of the sun’s motion through space, and on the theoretical
fact that for the structure of the universe it is not at all necessary
to know the distances of individual stars, but the mean distances of
groups of stars for different magnitude, spectral type, and galactic
latitude. The problem has two requirements: An accurate determi-
nation of the sun’s motion through space and a knowledge of the dis-
tribution of proper motion for an increasingly great number of
fainter and fainter stars. Along both lines the Groningen Publica-
tions reveal how much Kapteyn advanced our knowledge. And it
is in just such work as this that Kapteyn’s double aptitude for recog-
nizing great problems and at the same time perceiving the practical
difficulties was of the greatest usefulness. Kapteyn would work out
a new method which, with the proper material, would give the de-
sired results; but he would at the same time also apply his method
to the material available, even when it was scanty and likely to
yield only defective results. This, however, had the advantage of
showing at once where the method itself could be improved and what
data would be most needed. We see him follow this means of attack
in all his problems, by successive steps coming ever closer to the
laws governing the structure of the universe.

Incidentally, the investigations on proper motion led Kapteyn
to his discovery of the two star streams, which, rightly, was recently
selected by Eddington as one of the five greatest astronomical events
of the last hundred years, a discovery which has revolutionized
our ideas of the structure of the universe. In deriving the solar
motion Kapteyn was struck by the divergency of the results of
former investigators. In these researches it was usually assumed
that the motus peculiaris of the stars was at random, a natural
hypothesis, since with the enormous distances of the stars from one
another it was difficult.to see why there should be any relation be-
tween the individual motions of different stars. Yet stars moving
558 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

together in pairs or even in large groups were known. As early
as 1896, however, Kapteyn had noticed that the distribution of mo-
tion was not at random, but it was not until 1904 that he showed
that there is a fundamental peculiarity in these motions and that
they are not moving even approximately in a haphazard way. In-
stead of moving in all directions, as a random distribution would
require, the stars tend to move in two preferential directions. That
this tendency was so long overlooked by those who were working
on a determination of the solar motion is principally due to the
fact that they used the mean motions of all the stars in certain parts
of the sky. Kapteyn, however, went to work in a different way,
plotting the proper motions for limited regions of the sky. If for
convenience sake we assume all the stars in a certain region to be
located in the same point S of the sphere, then with a random dis-
tribution of the motus peculiaris alone, we find about the same num-
ber and about the same total motion in each direction. A motion
of the observer, such as we have as a result of the sun’s motion
through space, will add to each star a parallactic motion in the direc-
tion of the antapex. While this of course will disturb the symmetry of
the motions around the point 5, we still will have bilateral symmetry,
the line of symmetry evidently passing through the point S and the
apex. ‘This evident condition of bilateral symmetry would probably
furnish the best means of determining the apex, as these lines of
symmetry for the different parts of the sky must ail intersect in two
points, the apex and the antapex. In applying this idea to the
proper motions of about 2,400 Bradley stars, divided into 28 regions,
Kapteyn derived the distribution of the proper motions correspond-
ing to the center of the areas. The whole of the material was thus
embodied in 28 figures, like those in Figure 2, each of which shows
at a glance the distribution of the proper motions for one particular
region of the sky. This figure 2 is the same as the one shown by
Kapteyn at the Cape meeting of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science in 1905. Not to overburden the plate, only
10 of the 28 regions are included. If the hypothesis of random dis-
tribution were true, all these figures should be symmetrical with
respect to the line through the center of each field and the apex.
It is clear that this is not the case; each figure shows two preferen-
tial deviations. Kapteyn showed that the assymetry as shown in
the figure can be explained neither by an uncertainty in the preces-
sion, nor by systematic errors in the proper motions, nor by an erro-
neous position of the apex. As all the lines of favored directions
for the two sets seem to converge, approximately, to two points,
some 140° apart, the one 7° south of « Orionis, the other a few de-
grees south of » Sagittarii, Kapteyn came to the conclusion that we
J. C. KAPTEYN—VAN MAANEN 559

must have to do with two star streams, parallel to the lines joining
our solar system and the two points mentioned.

lt is evident that such a discovery as that of the star streams
would revolutionize the ideas of the structure of the universe. But
at the same time it pointed out the necessity of collecting an increas-
ing amount of data, in order to secure more reliable measures and
especially data for the fainter stars. It was clear that the desire
for such data could be satisfied only by the thorough cooperation
of several institutions according to a well-organized plan. Kapteyn
certainly was the right man to start such an organization. Through

his work he had come into contact with most of the leading astron-
omers all over the world. His visits to America in 1904 and South
Africa in 1905 gave splendid opportunity for discussing his plans
with a number of eminent astronomers. In order to enable those
who showed an interest in the matter to judge more thoroughly
of the details, Kapteyn worked out a provisional plan; the result
was a great deal of discussion and many useful suggestions. In
1906 Kapteyn published his famous Plan of Selected Areas. This
pamphlet gives briefly but clearly, as only Kapteyn could give
it, a program for the further attack on the structure of the uni-
verse. It includes not only the general plan but also in careful
560 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1923

detail the methods of securing the necessary data: Magnitude, proper
motion, parallax, class of spectrum, and radial velocities for the
stars in 252 well-selected regions. In the first and second reports
(1911) Kapteyn was able to announce the formation of a committee
to share the responsibility of advancing this plan. Its membership
included Gill, Pickering, Hale, Kiistner, Schwarzchild, Dyson,
Adams, and Kapteyn, and it is sad to state that with Kapteyn
one-half of its members have already gone forever. Yet the whole
astronomical world is so convinced of the need of such a cooperative
plan that it will undoubtedly be continued.

Next to the motions of the stars, their distribution in space
interested Kapteyn most keenly. In this connection he derived the
two well-known laws: The density law and the luminosity law,
the former giving the density of stars per unit of volume and the
change in the density with distance from the sun, and the latter,
the percentage of stars equal in luminosity to the sun, and of those
ten times, one hundred times, etc., as bright or as faint. Both are
statistical laws; they do not give the distance and brightness of the
individual stars, but how many stars there are at a certain distance
and of a certain brightness. By successive steps these researches
led Kapteyn to a conception of the distribution of the stars in space;
they indicate that the stars are contained in a nearly ellipsoidal uni-
verse with an axial ratio of 5.1, with a decrease in the density away
from the center and with the sun at a distance of about 650 parsecs
from the center. In his last long paper on the subject, which with
the modesty of the really great, was called “A first attempt at a
theory of the arrangement and motion of the sidereal system,” Kap-
teyn had the satisfaction of giving a beautiful exposition of his life
work. If a longer life had been granted to him, undoubtedly we
would have seen him elaborate his beloved subject; yet, as it is, it
must have been a great satisfaction to him to reach this goal.

At about the time Kapteyn was spending his vacations in Leiden
for the purpose of making his determinations of stellar parallaxes,
he became acquainted and was soon on terms of warm friendship
with the man who was then the leader in practical astronomy,
David Gill, director of the observatory at the Cape of: Good Hope.
The story of the Cape Photographic Durchmusterung is well known
to every astronomer. The difficulties met by Gill and Kapteyn
would have disheartened most men. Kapteyn’s famous letter of
1886 to Gill, offering his help in the following words, “ However,
1 think my enthusiasm for the matter will be equal to (say) six
or seven years of such work” has been widely quoted. It took
about double that time, yet his enthusiasm did not fail, and the
Cape Photographic Durchmusterung was completed with a thor-
J. C. KAPTEYN—VAN MAANEN 561

oughness and accuracy which could be obtained only by two such
masters. If we had no other work from his hand, Kapteyn’s name
would still take an honorable place in astronomical literature and
would be mentioned with those of Argelander, Schénfeld, and
Gould, names which every astronomer honors with gratitude. Yet
in addition to this we have his discovery of the star streams, his
plan of selected areas, his founding of the Groningen Astronomical
Laboratory, now called “ Astronomical Laboratory Kapteyn,” which
at the recent meeting of the International Astronomical Union,
Baillaud duly called one of the three things which in his 50 years
of astronomical life had revolutionized his science; and above all
we have Kapteyn’s investigations on the structure of the universe.

Truly Kapteyn belonged among the few really great men whose
death creates a vacancy which can not be filled.

J¢ seems superficial to enumerate here the many honors bestowed
on him during his life. For completeness, however, we must men-
tion them: Kapteyn received the honorary degree of D. Sc. from the
Cape of Good Hope; of D. Sc. from Harvard University; of LL. D.
from Edinburgh; he received the gold medal of the Royal Astro-
nomical Society, the Watson and the Bruce medals and the Prix de
Pontécoulant; he was chevalier of the Legion of Honor of France, of
the Netherlands Lion; he had the order “ Pour le Mérite,” and was
commander in the Dutch order of Oranje-Nassau. Kapteyn was
elected a member or associate of the following academies: Royal
Astronomical Society, American Philosophical Society, National
Academy of Sciences, Imperial Academy of St. Petersburg, Royal
Academy of Dublin, Royal Academy of Edinburgh, British Asso-
ciation, Royal Swedish Academy, Royal Society of Sciences of
Upsala, American Society, the Academy of Sciences in Paris, the
Royal Society of London, the Academy of Sciences in Finland, and
of the Royal Physical Association in Lund.

All through his life Kapteyn made friends—when he was young,
among the older people; when older, among each new generation
with which he came in contact. It was not difficult to become his
friend; he saw always the best qualities in every person; the rest
did not exist for him. There was always an atmosphere of happi-
ness around him, in his daily life as well as in the scientific assem-
blies, where he was the center of gravity. His departure will be
keenly felt in the astronomical world, but not there alone; many
others will mourn the ending of this noble and happy life.

Especially in America, Kapteyn had numerous friends. From
1908 to 1914 he came to this country every summer to spend a few
months at the Mount Wilson Observatory, of which institution he
was research associate. Kapteyn and Mrs. Kapteyn thoroughly

enjoyed their American trips, and these visits were no less appre-
ciated by all with whom they came in contact.

Mrs. Kapteyn was born Catharina Elisabeth Kalshoven, and they
were married in 1879. Their married life was singularly happy,
and she has been devoted to the welfare of her husband and chil-
dren—two daughters and a son—Jacoba Cornelia, wife of Prof. W.
Noordenbos, of Amsterdam; Henriette, wife of Prof. E. Hertz-
sprung, of Leiden; and Gerrit Jacobus Kapteyn, who is a mining
engineer.

How truly are his characteristics described by his friend Huiz-
enga in the July number of the Gids: “ When the right biographer
for Kapteyn is found the ‘ Life of Kapteyn’ will be one of the most
beautiful books that can be written.”
JULIUS VON HANN?

By G. C. Stimpson

It is probably the lot of everyone to have had during life a regard
for some person which amounts almost to personal and intimate
friendship, although one may never have seen or even corresponded
with the object of that regard. Sometimes it is an author, some-
times a character in a book, and sometimes a historical personage,
but in every case the feeling is very real and vivid. The scientist
experiences this feeling quite as strongly as those of a more literary
turn of mind, and to many of us Faraday, Maxwell, Kelvin are not
mere names met with in textbooks, but real live men worthy of
honor and devotion.

To many meteorologists, certainly to all who can read German,
Julius von Hann appealed in this way. One knew from his writings,
seldom controversial, never militant, that he must be of a quiet re-
tiring nature, a conclusion confirmed by all those who have had the
pleasure of his acquaintance. One likes to picture him in his room in
the Hohe Warte in Vienna searching, always searching, in likely,
and more often in unlikely, places for any reference to weather con-
ditions which could add to our knowledge of the atmosphere and its
ways.

And when Hann had once found a piece of weather information it
could never again be lost to the world. Within a month or two of
its discovery it was made known to all those whom it might concern
in the pages of the Meteorologische Zeitschrift ; but that was not all,
for Hann’s encyclopedic mind was able to see its relationship to other
factors, and like a piece in a puzzle it was fitted into its place to
make possible those masterly descriptions of climate found in his
Klimatologie and those clear accounts of atmospheric processes which
make up his Meteorologie.

Hann started his life as a school-teacher, but at the age of 29 his
natural-love of meteorology led him to enter the Central-Anstalt fiir

Meteorologie in Vienna; six years later, in 1874, he became director
and held that office until 1897, when at the age of 58 he retired. His
retirement was only from official duties; from meteorology he could
not retire until the very presence of death made further work im-
possible. The first fruit of his relief from official duties was his
Lehrbuch der Meteorologie, which was written between the autumn
of 1898 and August, 1900, in the Physitealische Institut in Graz.
This book, which was so different from any previous textbook of
meteorology, became at once the recognized standard book of refer-
ence, and from 1900 onwards practically no major piece of meteoro-
logical work has been published which does not draw upon the
Lehrbuch for facts and data.

Hann’s Handbuch der Klimatologie, which had been written
while he was still director of the Central-Anstalt, is probably better
known to British meteorologists than the Lehrbuch, for the only
reason that it has been published in an English translation. It is
surprising how readable Hann has made this book, dealing, as it
does, with little more than a mass of climatological statistics collected
from all parts of the world. But that is one of the great charms of
Hann’s writing, that he is able to present the driest of meteorological
facts in a pleasing and enticing manner. In the Klimatologie this
end has been reached by leaving in so much of the original work
from which the information has been extracted. It helps even a
meteorologist to enjoy the account of the climate of a place if he
knows that the data were provided by a Livingstone, a Franklin, or
a Scott.

The Klimatologie and the Meteorologie are Hann’s largest indi-
vidual works, but it is questionable whether the writing of these
books is his most valuable contribution to meteorology. Probably
science owes more to him for the mass of information he has rescued
from oblivion and preserved in the Meteorologische Zeitschrift, of
which he was the editor, or joint editor, from 1866 to 1920, the Zeit-
schrift in the meantime undergoing several changes both in name
and control.

Hann has received many honors, national and international;
probably of all of these, those which he most appreciated were the
issue in 1906 of a special volume of the Zeitschrift called the Hann
Band, to celebrate his 40 years of editorship, and the spontaneous
exhibition of esteem which he received on his eightieth birthday
from all parts of the world in spite of the disastrous effects of the
war on international relationships.

Hann was born on March 23, 1839, and died on Seiebee 1;-1994-—
a long life, a full life, and a life Ae which every ii dtebeoln ees has
cause to be grateful.
