REPORT

OF THE

SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

Cuarves D. Wa corr,
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1922.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith the annual
report of the activities and condition of the Smithsonian Institution
and its branches during the year ending June 30, 1922. The affairs
of the Institution proper (together with brief summaries of the
operations of the various branches) are given on pages 1 to 20
of this report, and the appendixes contain somewhat detailed
accounts of the year’s work, written by the head of each of the
branches. These include reports on the United States National
Museum, the National Gallery of Art, the Freer Gallery of Art,
the Bureau of American Ethnology, the International Exchanges,
the National Zoological Park, the Astrophysical Observatory, the
United States Regional Bureau of the International Catalogue of
Scientific Literature, the Smithsonian Library, and the publica-
tions of the Institution and its branches.

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
THE ESTABLISHMENT.

The Smithsonian Institution was created by act of Congress in
1846, according to the terms of the will of James Smithson, of
England, who in 1826 bequeathed his property to the United States
of America “ to found at Washington, under the name of the Smith-
sonian Institution, an establishment for the increase and diffusion
of knowledge among men.” In receiving the property and accept-
ing the trust Congress determined that the Federal Government was
without authority to administer the trust directly, and therefore
constituted an “establishment ” whose statutory members are “ the
President. the Vice President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of the
executive departments.”

if
2 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The affairs of the Institution are administered by a Board of
Regents whose membership consists of “the Vice President, the
Chief Justice, three Members of the Senate, and three Members of
the House of Representatives, together with six other persons other
than Members of Congress, two of whom shall be resident in the
city of Washington and the other four shall be inhabitants of some
State, but no two of them of the same State.” One of the Regents
is elected chancellor by the board; in the past the selection has
fallen upon the Vice President or the Chief Justice; and a suit-
able person is chosen by them as secretary of the Institution, who
is also secretary of the Board of Regents and the executive officer
directly in charge of the Institution’s activities.

In regard to the personnel of the board, the following changes
occurred during the year: Chief Justice William H. Taft became a
member of the board by virtue of his office; Representative Albert
Johnson, of the State of Washington, was appointed to succeed
Representative John A. Elston, who died during the year; and Dr.
Alexander Graham Bell retired from the board at the expiration
of his term.

The roll of the Regents at the close of the fiscal year was as follows:
Calvin Coolidge, Vice President of the United States, chancellor;
Chief Justice William H. Taft; Henry Cabot Lodge, Member of
the Senate; A. Owsley Stanley, Member of the Senate; Medill Mc-
Cormick, Member of the Senate; Lemuel P. Padgett, Member of
the House of Representatives; Frank L. Greene, Member of the
House of Representatives; Albert Johnson, Member of the House
of Representatives; George Gray, citizen of Delaware; Charles F.
Choate, jr., citizen of Massachusetts; John B. Henderson, citizen of
Washington, D. C.; Henry White, citizen of Washington, D. C., and
Robert S. Brookings, citizen of Missouri.

The board held its annual meeting on December 8, 1921. The
proceedings of that meeting, as well as the annual financial report
of the executive committee, have been printed as usual for the use
of the Regents, while such important matters acted upon as are
of public interest are reviewed under appropriate heads in the
present report of the secretary. A detailed description of dis-
bursements from the Government appropriations under the direction
of the Institution for the maintenance of the National Museum,
the National Zoological Park, and other branches will be submitted
to Congress by the secretary in the usual manner in accordance
with the law.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

Desiring to increase the research output of the Institution, your
secretary called a meeting in May of this year of the scientific
staff of the Institution and its branches to consider ways and means
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

of inaugurating and carrying out a program of more extensive
original research. At this meeting a committee on research was
named, with Dr. George P. Merrill, head curator of geology, as
chairman, which will consider the subject this summer and it is
expected will be prepared in the fall to offer a definite program.

The great need of the Institution is for a larger endowment to
enable it to extend the scope of its activities in the “increase and
diffusion of knowledge among men.” During the 76 years of its
existence, except for several generous contributions for specific
objects, the income of the Institution has not been materially in-
creased. With the great increase in its scientific activities and
output of publications, it becomes more and more difficult to make
the limited income cover the mounting expense, and many oppor-
tunities to carry on valuable scientific investigations must be passed
by every year. It is hoped that some one, recognizing the ad-
vantageous position of the Institution for promoting scientific work
in America, will provide a suitable endowment.

FINANCES.
The permanent investments of the Institution consist of the

Mr. B. H. Swales, custodian, section of birds’ eggs, continues to
favor the Institution with his valuable assistance in the form of con-
tributions for the purchase of specimens for the division of birds.
This year his contributions have amounted to $400.

Dr. William L. Abbott has contributed $2,000 for the purpose
of continuing the collecting of natural history specimens. The
Australian expedition, the expense of which was maintained en-
tirely by Doctor Abbott for three years, has been successfully con-
cluded, and work in new fields is contemplated in the near future.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

Mr. John A. Roebling has made further gifts to the Institution
to the extent of $15,771.38, to aid in the maintenance of astrophysical
stations in Chile and in Arizona and for the publication of scien-
tific papers.

The executors of the Freer estate have transferred to the Insti-
tution 6,546 shares of Parke, Davis & Co., to apply to the Freer
residuary fund. The shares of this corporation now received for
the several specific purposes provided by Mr. Freer are as follows:

To pay inheritance and Federal taxes, it became necessary, with
the approval of the Board of Regents, to place a loan with a local
trust company for that purpose. The loan is being gradually re-
duced and now amounts to $170,000.

Dividends and interest on securities acquired from the Freer
estate have amounted to $83,127.36. Thirty thousand dollars have
been expended to liquidate the above-mentioned obligation, and
$55,034.48 for purposes prescribed by the testator, including the
purchase of art objects.

The sum of $55,823.44, constituting the balance of the building
fund, was transferred to the books of the Institution, and $32,122.78
has been expended. With the addition of a credit transferred from
another Freer fund, the balance available for completion and equip-
ment of the building is $32,074.97.

The Institution’s income for general expenses is received period-
ically and at times is in excess of immediate requirements. A part
of this income is deposited on time at the rate of 3 per cent per
annum. This year interest acquired principally in this manner
amounted to $2,033.93.

The income during the year for current expenses, consisting of
interest on permanent investments and other miscellaneous re-
sources, was $61,872.14, receipts from Freer bequest $138,950.80.
other revenues for specific purposes, $50,850.04; which, with cash
on hand and subject to check on July 1, 1921, amounting to
$11,229.34, constituted a total of $262,902.32.

The disbursements, described more fully in the annual report
of the executive committee, were classed as follows: General ob-
jects of the Institution, $62,749.17; investments and expenditures
for specific purposes, $33,553.24; temporary advances in excess of
repayments, $2,578.50; cash deposited on time, $40,500; disbursed

from revenues of Freer bequest, $117,157.26; and $6,864.15 in cash
and deposited subject to check.

The Institution was charged by Congress with the disbursement
of the following appropriations for the year ending June 30, 1922:

There was also appropriated for printing and binding $91,000, to
cover the cost of printing and binding the Smithsonian annual re-
port and reports and miscellaneous printing for Government branches
of the Institution.

RESEARCHES AND EXPLORATIONS.

Each year the Institution sends out, as far as its limited funds
permit, expeditions for the purpose of exploring scientifically little-
known regions of the earth, or to conduct needed field work in more
familiar localities, thus furthering one of its principal objects,
the “increase of knowledge.” It is also able to cooperate advan-
tageously with other institutions by contributing members of its
scientific staff to expeditions already organized and financed. The
results of the more noteworthy of these expeditions are here de-
scribed briefly, and the field work of the various branches of the
Institution will be found in the appendixes to this report.

GEOLOGICAL EXPLORATIONS IN THE CANADIAN ROCKIES.

During the summer and early fall of 1921 your secretary carried
on geological field work in the Canadian Rocky Mountains in con-
tinuation of previous years’ work in this region. His objects were
to secure data on the pre-Devonian strata of the Sawback Range
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. t

in Ranger Brook Canyon and to conduct a reconnaissance of the
pre-Devonian formations to the Northwest as far as the headwaters
of the North Fork of the Saskatchewan River, Alberta.

The field season was an unusually unfavorable one for geological
work. During the three months in the field 35 days were stormy,
28 cloudy and cold, and snow fell on 20 days in August and Sep-
tember. As a result, not more than one-third of the work planned
was accomplished before the party was driven back to the railroad
by heavy snows.

On our way north we crossed over Pipestone Pass and down the
Siffeur River. Clearwater River heads in glacial gravels on the
east side of the Siffleur about 2 miles north of Pipestone Pass.
Twenty-five miles farther to the northwest at the point where the
south branch (Mistaya Creek), the middle branch (Howse River),
and the north branch unite to form the Saskatchewan River there
are some beautiful and instructive views of the surrounding moun-
tains. The Mount Forbes massif on the left is a superb mountain
mass and in the distant center is Division Mountain at the head of
Glacier Lake Canyon which we visited in 1919, on the right Survey
Peak and beyond two unnamed points. The Glacier Lake section
of the pre-Devonian and Upper Cambrian formations was studied
on the northern slopes of the Mount Forbes massif.

Twelve miles northeast of Mount Forbes the cliffs of Mount
Murchison rise high above the dark forested slopes and present a
view of the Devonian and pre-Devonian formations that is un-
equaled in all this region of peaks, cliffs, and broad canyon valleys.

Opposite Mount Murchison on the north side of the Saskatchewan,
Mount Wilson presents another section of the pre-Devonian forma-
tions, the upper end of which is a massive white quartzite formed
of the sands of the beaches over which the Devonian Sea deposited
a thick layer of calcareous sediments abounding in the remains of
corals and various invertebrates of the time. On the west, Mount
Wilson rises directly above the North Fork of the Saskatchewan,
which here flows through a narrow picturesque inner canyon.

PALEONTOLOGICAL FIELD WORK IN THE UNITED STATES.

Dr. R. 8. Bassler, curator of the division of paleontology in the
National Museum, was occupied during the field season in collecting
geologic material and in mapping and studying the economic re-
sources of the Franklin quadrangle in Williamson County, Tenn.,
in cooperation with the Geological Survey of that State. This region
is of considerable economic interest on account of the phosphate
and oil shale possibilities. The numerous outcrops of Ordovician
and later Paleozoic formations contain a great number of fossils,
8 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

and Doctor Bassler was able to make a considerable collection of
these needed for the Museum study series. He also secured several
large exhibition specimens illustrating various geological phe-
nomena, among these being a large mass of limestone composed en-
tirely of the dismembered calices and columns of a large species of
rrinoid or sea lily in which the individual fragments are perfectly
preserved and admirably illustrate the formation of a limestone
through the accumulation of this type of animal remains.

An interesting stratigraphic observation was made on the efficacy
of the coral reefs of the Ordovician in rock formation. A massive
limestone bed about 15 feet thick, representing a middle Ordovician
formation, here contains but a single coral reef, but within 10 miles
the number of intercalated coral reefs has so increased that the for-
mation attains a thickness of over 250 feet.

In April Mr. C. W. Gilmore, associate curator of vertebrate pale-
ontology, was authorized to undertake a trip into New Mexico “ for
the purpose of making collections of geological material for the Na-
tional Museum and determining the advisability of preserving cer-
tain lands in northern New Mexico for national monumental pur-
poses.” ‘Mr. Gilmore was obliged to report that—

Since the many square miles of “ bad lands” surrounding the reserved area
are equally fossiliferous and in places present much more favorable territory
for the recovery of fossil remains than any observed within the boundaries of
the monument, and also since the greater part of these surrounding areas lie
within Pueblo grants, over which Federal control has been relinquished, there
would be no advantage in retaining governmental control of so small a part
of the area as is represented in the proposed monument.

Mr. Gilmore did, however, find a contiguous fossiliferous area in
the Santa Clara Pueblo grant and secured for the Museum a well-
preserved skull and other bones of a small rhinoceros, and, in an
adjoining Pojoaque Pueblo area, remains of an extinct camel. The
most promising area for collecting would appear to lie within land
grants over which the Government has at present no control.

In January, this same year, Mr. J. W. Gidley, assistant curator of
this division, was authorized, in cooperation with the United States
Geological Survey, to conduct field explorations in the San Pedro
and Sulphur Springs Valleys of southern Arizona, and on the com-
pletion of this work to visit the La Brea asphalt deposits of southern
California, and from there go to Agate, in Nebraska, for the pur-
pose of securing other exhibition material. The work in Arizona
was eminently successful, Mr. Gidley shipping some 24 boxes having
an aggregate weight of 5,000 pounds. The bulk of this collection,
he reports, represents “a practically new Pliocene fauna containing
about 60 vertebrate species, most of which are mammalian,”
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. SS)

BOTANICAL EXPEDITION TO THE ORIENT.

As noted in last year’s report, Dr. A. S. Hitchcock, custodian of
the section of grasses of the National Museum, visited the Orient
under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture for the purpose
of collecting and studying grasses, especially the bamboos. As the
specimens collected come to the National Museum, it will not be out
of place to here mention briefly Doctor Hitchcock’s work. The trip
occupied about eight months, ending in December, 1921, and the
regions visited included the Philippines, Japan, China, and Indo-
China.

Japan is not very favorable for the collecting of grasses, as it is
mostly a forested region and there is comparatively little open coun-
try. The bamboos were of interest, as there are many species. In
the Lake Hakone region the hills were covered for miles with a
single species of bamboo (Arundinaria chino), 4 to 8 feet high, often
to the exclusion of everything else.

China, on the other hand, was very rich in grasses. One of the
surprises of the trip was to find so much open grass land in a country
that is said to be very thickly populated. The cities of China are
very much crowded and the valley lands are intensively cultivated,
but the hills are unoccupied and almost unused. This is in striking
contrast to our own western regions where, except in national forests
and other protected areas, the grass lands are extensively grazed.
The basic reason for this condition in China appears to be the risk
from bandits. The valley lands can be protected but the hills are
open to the attack of robbers.

The expendition was very successful, and a large and valuable col-
lection of grasses was brought back. The technical results of the
work will be published later by the Department of Agriculture or the
National Herbarium of the National Museum.

AUSTRALIAN EXPEDITION.

Through the generosity of Dr. W, L. Abbott, Mr. Charles M. Hoy
continued his work of collecting for the Museum specimens of the
very interesting fauna of Australia. The work was terminated dur-
ing the winter and Mr. Hoy returned to the United States in May,
1922. The results of this expedition are of especial value for two
reasons: First, the Australian fauna has heretofore been but scantily
represented in the Museum, and, second, the remarkable fauna of
that continent is rapidly being exterminated through various causes.
The specimens received during the year bring the total up to 1,179
mammals, including series of skeletal and embryological material ;
928 birds, with 41 additional examples in alcohol; and smaller collec-
tions of reptiles, amphibians, insects, marine specimens, etc.
10 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

For assistance and courtesies extended to Mr. Hoy while in Aus-
tralia the Smithsonian Institution wishes to make grateful acknowl-
edgment to the authorities of the Australian Museum, Sydney; the
Queensland Museum, Brisbane; the South Australian Museum, Ade-
laide; the West Australian Museum and Art Gallery, Perth; and
the Tasmanian Museum and Art Gallery, Hobart; also and particu-
larly to Dr. Charles Hedley and Dr. Charles Anderson, of Sydney;
Harry Burrell, Esq., of Kensington, New South Wales; and Capt.
S. W. White of Fulham, South Australia.

BIOLOGIOAL EXPLORATION IN THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIO.

Dr. W. L. Abbott, whose generosity in years past has enabled the
Institution to take advantage of many opportunities in biological and
other explorations, himself visited during the year the Dominican
Republic, working in both the Samana Peninsula and the region
lying between Sanchez (at the head of Samana Bay) and Puerto
Plata, on the north coast. Having visited this region before, he was
able to select new and interesting localities for collecting.

Doctor Abbott’s work included botanical, zoological, and ethnologi-
cal collecting, and the specimens sent in to the National Museum will
go far toward completing the various series representing this region.
Some 4,000 plants were collected, of which about 20 per cent were
ferns. The ethnological material, including aboriginal Indian pot-
tery and idols, is of great interest and has been described and figured
in the annual pamphlet on the explorations and field work of the
Institution.

ENTOMOLOGICAL EXPEDITION TO ALASKA,

Dr. J. M. Aldrich, associate curator of insects in the National
Museum, spent several weeks during the field season collecting in-
sects in Alaska. The Government railroad from the southern coast
to Fairbanks, now nearing completion, offered an opportunity for
travel not heretofore existing, and it was felt that it was important
to know more about the insect fauna of this great region in view
of the fact that the population will undoubtedly increase with the
completion of the railroad. Regarding his work, Doctor Aldrich
says:

The expedition resulted in the accession of about 10,000 specimens of
Alaska insects, nearly all from the interior region. As far as they have
been studied up to the present time they indicate three somewhat distinct
faunal regions in the territory covered.

First, the maritime fauna consisting of the insects living upon the sea-
shore and depending upon the ocean for necessary conditions of existence.
Insects of this group extend down the coast, in many cases as far as the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 11

State of Washington and some even so far as San Francisco, while it is
presumed that they would also be found more or less in the Asiatic side of
Bering Sea.

The second element is that of the humid mountain region along the coast;
a considerable part of this fauna extends to Puget Sound, Mount Rainier,
and in less degree to other mountains of the Pacific Northwest. The relation
of this element to the Asiatie fauna is very little known.

The third element of the Alaska fauna, as far as observed, is that of the
dry interior and especially of the Yukon Valley, which has many elements
in common with northern Minnesota, Wisconsin, and Michigan, Ontario, the
Adirondack Mountains of New York, and the White Mountains of New
Hampshire. Many of the insects of this group also occur in the Rocky
Mountains of Colorado and no doubt further exploration will show that they
occur in other mountains of the western United States. Those which repre-
sent a more northern range also reappear in Labrador collections and pre-
sumably extend across North America, although we have no collections from
intermediate points. This element contains many species known from Fin-
land and the Scandinavian Peninsula in Europe, presumably extending in
their distribution across Russia and Siberia.

In most orders of insects Alaska has a comparatively large fauna. There
are very numerous species of the two-winged flies, or Diptera; and from
Doctor Aldrich’s long experienve with this group he naturally paid special atten-
tion to collecting in this order.

Bumblebees and wasps are conspicuous insects everywhere on flowers; and
in the absence of darkness bumblebees were observed to work as late as 10:30
at night in Fairbanks. Grasshoppers were strikingly scarce, only two species
being found and in all but half a dozen specimens. Mosquitoes in the interior
are exceedingly abundant, as is well known. Hspecial attention was given to
them in collecting, and two species previously undescribed were among the
material brought back. It appears, however, that the most troublesome species
are the same ones which occur in somewhat less numbers in the Pacific North-
west in occasional favorable localities. Horseflies are very numerous in the
region at Wairbanks, where they are commonly called moosefiies, since the moose
is more common than the horse.

The exploration of Alaska, especially the interior, from an entomological
point of view, is important in itself and also forms a link in the study of a
much broader problem—that of the entire Holarctic fauna which extends almost
continuously around the globe in the vicinity of the Arctic Circle. It is a
matter of great scientific interest to determine how much of this northern
fauna is the same in the New World as in the Old, and also to determine how
much of the fauna farther south, as, for instance, in the United States, has been
derived from this northern region. It is hoped that opportunity will arise to
carry this exploration much farther, not only in Alaska, where as yet only a
beginning has been made, but also in other northern regions, as, for instance,
Labrador, Greenland, and Siberia.

THE INSTITUTE FOR RESEARCH IN TROPICAL AMERICA,

The recently organized Institute for Research in Tropical America,
of which the Smithsonian Institution is a member, is hoping to
establish a research station in Panama. Such a station when prop-
erly equipped will serve as a center for the prosecution of research
upon problems in tropical biology and agriculture, and as a center
from which biological explorations can be made.
12 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

PLORA OF THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.

At the request of Gen. Leonard Wood, Governor General of the
Philippine Islands, a plan for the preparation of a flora of the
Philippine Islands was drawn up by the Institution, together with
an estimate of the cost. This work, which it is proposed will be
accomplished through cooperation of the Smithsonian Institution
with the Philippine Government, will be of the greatest importance
to the agricultural interests, and, since the prosperity of the Phil-
ippines is primarily dependent on agriculture, to the islands them-
selves. In addition to these material benefits, such a flora would be
of great value to science, and a large number of specimens of rare
and valuable plants from the Philippines would come to the National
Herbarium as a result of its preparation.

At the close of the fiscal year funds had not been appropriated
for beginning the work.

BAIRD MEMORIAL COMMITTEE.

To celebrate the centenary of the birth of Spencer Fullerton
Baird, second secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, February
3, 1923, there was formed early in 1922 the Baird Memorial Com-
mittee. It was decided at a preliminary meeting that a public
meeting should be held in Washington on February 3, 1923, at which
addresses would be delivered and announcements made of the form
of memorial or memorials that had been decided upon, and that
wreaths should be placed on the grave of Baird in Oak Hill Ceme-
tery, the bust of Baird in the American Museum of Natural History
in New York City, the Baird memorial bowlder of the American
Fisheries Society at Woods Hole, and the Baird memorial tablet
at the Bureau of Fisheries in Washington.

The form which the memorial to Professor Baird should take was
not definitely decided upon, several plans having been considered.
Among these were a bust or tablet to be erected in the Smithsonian
grounds, the establishment of a Baird memorial medal to be awarded
for specially meritorious work in science, the publication of a memo-
rial volume of original scientific papers by Baird’s associates or fol-
lowers, and a fisheries exhibit, preferably a museum.

DEVELOPMENT OF MULTIPLE-CHARGE ROCKET.

The development of a model multiple-charge rocket, mentioned
in previous reports, for the purpose of demonstrating the principle,
is being continued by Prof. Robert H. Goddard, of Clark University,
under a grant from the Hodgkins fund.

The specific work of the past year has been the development and
test of certain new features which will increase considerably the
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. fo

effectiveness of the apparatus. A discussion of these, in detail, is
deferred for a later report. Additional financial support has been
granted for the work by Clark University.

PUBLICATIONS.

A total of 164 volumes and pamphlets were issued during the
year by the Institution and its branches. Of these publications,
there were distributed a total of 165,196 copies, including 251
volumes and separates of the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowl-
edge, 20,777 volumes and separates of the Smithsonian Miscel-
laneous Collections, 27,268 volumes and separates of the Smith-
sonian annual reports, 97,806 volumes and separates of the publica-
tions of the National Museum, 14,215 publications of the Bureau
of American Ethnology, 3,159 special publications, 706 volumes of
the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, 64 reports on the
Harriman Alaska expedition, and 812 reports of the American His-
torical Association.

The Institution carries out one of its chief functions, the “ dif-
fusion of knowledge,” by means of its various series of publications.
They embrace the results of investigations and systematic studies
in nearly every branch of natural science, and are distributed, in
most cases free of charge, to important libraries, educational in-
stitutions, and scientific establishments throughout the world. In
order to assist in creating a greater popular interest in scientific
matters, the annual report of the Institution has always contained
a general appendix consisting of a large selection of authentic,
semipopular articles reviewing recent advances in every branch of
scientific activity. There is a widespread and growing demand
for this publication, showing an increased appreciation of the value
of science and scientific investigations.

Besides the annual report, the Institution issues two series of
publications, the Contributions to Knowledge and the Miscellaneous
Collections. The publications of the National Museum and the
Bureau of American Ethnology are mentioned in the reports of
those branches appended hereto.

Of the series of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections, 9 papers
were issued during the year, among them one paper by your sec-
retary in the series on Cambrian Geology and Paleontology, and
the usual annual pamphlet describing and illustrating the various
scientific expeditions sent out or cooperated in by the Smithsonian
Institution.

Allotments for printing—The congressional allotments for the
printing of the Smithsonian reports and the various publications
of the branches of the Institution were practically used up at the

Smithsonian advisory committee on printing and publication is to
make recommendations regarding the merit and suitability of all
manuscripts submitted for publication by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion or its branches and also to consider all other matters relating to
printing and binding under the Institution. During the past year
eight meetings were held and 100 manuscripts acted upon. The
membership of the committee is as follows: Dr. Leonhard Stejneger,
head curator of biology, National Museum, chairman; Dr. George
P. Merrill, head curator of geology, National Museum; Dr. J. Walter
Fewkes, chief, Bureau of American Ethnology; Mr. N. Hollister,
superintendent, National Zoological Park; and Mr. W. P. True,
editor of the Smithsonian Institution, secretary.

LIBRARY.

The facilities of the library have been taxed to the utmost. The
number of loans for the fiscal year amounted to 14,436, and as many
more books and periodicals were consulted without being taken from
the buildings. Interlibrary loans to accredited libraries, where
distance permits, are being continued, and in a number of instances
arrangements have been made for the photostating of pages from
rare volumes not permitted to leave the library.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

Each day typewritten lists of original articles appearing in scien-
tific periodicals received for the Smithsonian deposit in the Library
of Congress are prepared and circulated among the heads of scien-
tific bureaus under the Institution. These daily bibliographical lists,
begun last November at the request of Secretary Walcott, have been
well received from the start. Requests have come in for copies from
other Government bureaus and research organizations, which it has
not been possible to comply with, owing to lack of necessary equip-
ment for the preparation of additional copies. The library now
possesses more than a million volumes, pamphlets, manuscripts, and
charts, there being 888,128 publications deposited in the Library of
Congress, 156,275 belonging to the National Museum, and 35,000
belonging to other branches of the Institution. The number of
additions for the fiscal year was 15,796.

As noteworthy additions to the various branch libraries might
be mentioned that of the Géttingische Gelehrte Anzeigen for 1758,
1760, 1808, 1813, and 1814 to the Smithsonian deposit, by gift of the
Gesellschaft fiir Wissenschaften zu Gdéttingen; Serindia, by Sir
Aurel Stein, to the office library, at present deposited in the Freer
Building, the gift of the Secretary of State for India; and the
second and third volumes of Beebe’s Monograph of the Pheasants,
added to the library of the National Zoological Park.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The year has been an unusually busy one for the Museum, but
although of late years its activities have greatly increased and its
scope widely extended, the appropriation for its maintenance has
remained practically the same for the past 11 years. Much credit
is due the members of the Museum’s staff for the fine results recorded
from year to year. Undoubtedly the most important event of the
year was the receipt and installation of the Herbert Ward collection
of African ethnologica and sculptures. This collection, one of the
most important ethnological units in the world, was brought together
by Herbert Ward, an Englishman, who was with Stanley on his
famous exploring expedition through Africa. It consists of 2,700
ethnological specimens and 19 superb sculptures in bronze of African
natives by Mr. Ward.

An actual beginning was made during the year toward establish-
ing the Loeb collection of chemical types, noted in the 1920 report.
Two specially constructed cabinets were received from the Chemists’
Club of New York, and a portion of each of seven new chemical
compounds discovered in the Department of Agriculture were de-
posited in the collection. It is planned to solicit all available new
chemical material, with the view of eventually making of the Loeb
collection a complete series for the use of investigators in chemistry.
16 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

The Museum acquired during the year a total of 359,677 speci-
mens. These are described somewhat in detail in the report on the
Museum, appended hereto, but it will be of interest to mention here
a few of the more important accessions. In anthropology the most
important addition was the Herbert Ward African collection men-
tioned above. A large collection of the brilliant ancient pottery from
the ruins of Casas Grandes, Chihuahua, Mexico, was received through
the Archeological Society of Washington, and a remarkable series
of aboriginal pottery collected by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes in the
neighboring Mimbres Valley, N. Mex., was also placed on exhibition.
A number of pianos were added by Mr. Hugo Worch to his notable
collection, among them a magnificent gilt harpsichord made by
Pleyel, Paris.

In the department of biology the outstanding feature of the year’s
accessions is the collection of about 100,000 insects collected by Dr.
William Mann in South America, especially eastern Bolivia. An-
other important collection of insects was that made by Dr. J. M.
Aldrich in Alaska, which numbered around 10,000 specimens. A
considerable consignment of biological material, mostly vertebrates,
was received from Mr. Hoy, who has been working in Australia
under the auspices of Dr. W. L. Abbott. This material brings the
important Australian expedition to a most successful termination.

In geology a number of valuable additions were made to the
collections, among them specimens of Bolivian tin and tungsten
ores from Mr. F. L. Hess; rich examples of carnotite and hewettite
presented by the Standard Chemical Co., Naturita, Colo.; eight gold
nuggets donated by Mr. Frank Springer; a large mass of meteoric
iron from Owen Valley, Calif., the gift of Mr. Lincoln Ellsworth,
of New York; a number of beautiful and valuable gems purchased
for the Isaac Lea collection through its endowment fund; and a con-
siderable amount of paleontological material, both vertebrate and
invertebrate.

The divisions of mineral and mechanical technology have devoted
their time largely to a more perfect and permanent arrangement of
the great amount of exhibition material already on hand, while the
divisions of history, textiles, and graphic arts report many valuable
and interesting additions to their collections.

In addition to the explorations and field work mentioned earlier
in this report, the Museum sent out or cooperated in various other
expeditions. Mr. Arthur de C. Sowerby continued his work in
China under the auspices of Mr. Robert Sterling Clark, who gen-
erously contributed all the material collected to the Museum. A
shipment of vertebrates and other biological material was received
from this expedition during the year. Mr. Paul C. Standley.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

through the cooperation of various agencies, spent five months in
botanical collecting in El Salvador and Guatemala, bringing back
over 6,000 specimens. Another botanical expedition, consisting of
Dr. F. W. Pennell and Mr. E. P. Killip, was in western Colombia
at the close of the year under the auspices of various scientific or-
ganizations. The purpose of the exploration was to study the flora
and secure botanical specimens in this region, as one of a series lead-
ing up to a complete study of the flora of northern South America.

The auditorium and adjacent rooms of the Museum were used by
numerous societies and organizations for meetings, congresses, and
lectures. The Museum published during the year 9 volumes and 78
separate papers. These are described somewhat in detail in the
“ Report on publications,” Appendix 10 of this report. The number
of visitors to the National History Building during the year was
441,604; to the Arts and Industries Building, 262,151; and to the
Aircraft Building, 46,380.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART.

Although the number of art works accessioned by the National
Gallery during the year falls short of the average of recent years.
nevertheless progress in the gallery’s activities has been satisfactory.
The greatest handicap to its work continues to be lack of exhibition
space. It is believed that the falling off in number of accessions
noted above is in part due to this shortage of space, as owners of
valuable art works very naturally desire to see them adequately
housed and exhibited. The urgent need of a suitable gallery for
the national collections, already valued in the millions, will be readily
understood when it is considered that until the past year the acces-
sions to the collections were estimated at hundreds of thousands
annually. If accessions are turned elsewhere on account of the lack
of space to exhibit them, it is evident that in a few years the loss will
amount to more than the cost of a building.

Among the accessions received during the year was a portrait of
President Grant, by Thomas Le Clear, presented by Mrs. U. S.
Grant, jr.; an oil painting entitled “The Signing of the Treaty of
Ghent,” by Sir A. Forestier, presented to the Smithsonian Institu-
tion by the Sulgrave Institution; a painting entitled “ Tohickon,”
by Daniel Garber, provided through the Henry Ward Ranger be-
quest; and a portrait of Edwin H. Harriman, an artist’s proot etch-
ing, one of 21 from the copper. A number of interesting art works
were loaned to the gallery during the year, among them being 71
portraits in pastel, in a series of 22 life-size groups of Union and Con-
federate veterans of the Civil War, painted from life by Walter
Beck, of Brooklyn, N. Y.. 50 years after the Battle of Appomattox,
18 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

loaned by the artist through Mr. Walter M. Grant, of New York
City.

Preliminary steps had been taken at the end of the year toward
the acceptance of a rich collection of British masterpieces brought
together by the late John H. McFadden, of Philadelphia. The col-
lection comprises 44 notable examples of the work of nineteen British
artists, and the acceptance of this valuable loan is regarded with
much favor.

A number of paintings were acquired from the income of the
Henry Ward Ranger bequest and assigned to various art institutions
throughout the country. The terms of this bequest stipulate that
any of the art works so acquired may be claimed during a certain
period after the artist’s death by the National Gallery of Art,
remaining thereafter the property of the National Gallery. The
selection and distribution of these purchases is entrusted to the
National Academy of Design.

The income from the Bruce Hughes bequest is to be used to estab-
lish and maintain a section of the library of the National Gallery
for reference works of art, to be known as the Hughes alcove. Dur-
ing the year the first purchases were made from this fund. An
illustrated catalogue of the art works of the gallery was prepared
and submitted to the printer during the year, but on June 30, 1922,
had not been published. A lecture on the National Gallery, illus-
trated by 75 slides mostly in color, was prepared, and is to be placed
at the disposal of persons throughout the country who desire to
present it.
| The first annual meeting of the National Gallery of Art Com-
mission was held on December 6, 1921. Reports of the committees
were presented and many important matters relating to the gallery
were discussed, among them the urgent need of a National Gallery
Building and the problem of the acceptance of proffered works of art.

FREER GALLERY OF ART.

Work during the year on the collections of the Freer Gallery
of Art included chiefly the classification and cataloguing of Chinese,
Japanese, and Tibetan paintings, Chinese tapestries, and Chinese and
Japanese pottery; the preliminary classification of Korean pottery
and Chinese and Japanese stone sculptures and jades; and the
cataloguing of American paintings, drawings, and prints.

Progress has been made also on completing certain portions of the
interior of the building and on the installation of the collections.
Miss Grace Dunham Guest was appointed assistant curator on Janu-
ary 1, 1922, and Mr. Carl W. Bishop associate curator, April 9, 1922.
Miss Guest sailed for Europe on June 24, 1922, to represent the
Freer Gallery at the double centennial meeting of the Société Asia-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

tique de Paris, and to study European collections of oriental art,
especially ceramics.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The material culture and ceremonials of the American Indian
are being modified so rapidly through contact with the white race
that it is imperative for the bureau to make every effort to record
all possible data bearing on the aboriginal Indian culture. The de-
sirability of preserving this material so that accurate knowledge
of this interesting and vanishing race may be available for future
generations is evident. Another important line of endeavor is the
excavating and repairing of prehistoric Indian dwellings. These
ancient ruins are the object of great popular as well as scientific
interest, and it is the aim of the chief of the bureau to continue
this archeological phase of the work in so far as funds will permit.

A new line of investigation has opened up for the bureau dur-
ing the year, namely, the study of the material culture, and espe-
cially the architecture of the houses, of the aborigines of Alaska.
The early villages of the Alaskan Indians have in many cases been
deserted in the exodus to the canning factories, and the totem poles
and villages which are rapidly being destroyed by the elements
should be preserved in the immediate future so that they will not be
Jost forever. During the spring of 1922, Dr. T. T. Waterman con-
ducted for the bureau an extended reconnaissance of the situation,
bringing back many interesting data and photographs. It is in-
tended to continue the work next year with a larger appropriation.

The work in the field and in the office of the individual members
of the staff is reviewed somewhat in detail in Appendix 4 of this
report, so that it will be necessary here only to give an idea of the
scope of the work. The chief continued his successful archeo-
logical field work on the Mesa Verde National Park, Colo., bring-
ing to light a most interesting and instructive ruin which he has
named “ Pipe Shrine House” on account of the numerous tobacco
pipes found on a shrine in the kiva of this ruin. He also excavated
and repaired Far View Tower, a round structure 10 feet high,
which was probably used for observations of the position of the
sun on the horizon at sunrise and sunset, in order to determine the
time for planting and other dates important for an agricultural
people.

The chief also visited the three groups of towers in Utah which
he has recommended for the Hovenweep National Monument, and
determined the exact situation of these ruins as a preliminary to
a presidential proclamation setting aside this area as a national
monument.
20 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

Dr. John R. Swanton continued work on his dictionaries of the
Hitchiti and Alabama languages. Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt devoted
his time to a number of Chippewa and Ottawa texts, and in con-
tinuing the preparation of the second part of his work on Iro-
quoian Cosmology, the first part of which has already been pub-
lished by the bureau. Mr. Francis La Flesche completed and
turned in during the year the manuscript of the second volume of
his publication on The Osage Tribe. Dr. Truman Michelson car-
ried on field work among the Fox Indians of Iowa, paying special
attention to the linguistic relations of this and neighboring tribes.
Mr. J. P. Harrington completed his bulletin on the Kiowa language
and conducted field work among the Indians of the Chumashan
area of California, laying special emphasis on the place names,
material culture, and language.

Under the head of special researches, the chief of the bureau
describes the work of Miss Frances Densmore on Indian music.
During the year she recorded songs among the Yuma, Cocopa, and
Yaqui tribes, making a total of nine tribes among whom this work
has been done. Mr. W. E. Myer investigated Indian sites in South
Dakota and western Missouri known to have been occupied by the
Omahas and Osages in early historic times after they had come
in contact with the whites but before they had been changed thereby
to any considerable extent.

Several other interesting special researches are reviewed in the
appendix on the bureau, among them field work by Mr. D. lI.
Bushnell, Jr., on the Cahokia mounds in Illinois; by Mr. B. S. Guha,
among the Utes and the Navaho at Towoac, Colo., and Shiprock,
N. Mex.; and by Mr. John L. Baer on pictographic rocks in the
Susquehanna River.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

During the year the number of packages of scientific and gov-
ernmental publications sent abroad and received from foreign coun-
tries totaled 592,600 pounds. Although these figures show a de-
crease from the previous year, on account of the fact that ship-
ments to Germany were resumed during that year and most of the
material accumulated during the war was sent out, nevertheless
there is an increase of 41,490 packages over the number sent out
in 1914, the last year before the World War, showing that there
is a steady growth in the work of the International Exchange
service.

Exchange relations were reopened during the year with Ru-
mania and Yugoslavia, the agencies in these countries being, re-
spectively, the Institutul Meteorological Central at Bukharest, and
the Académie Royale Serbe des Sciences et des Arts, Belgrade.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. o1

Relations were established also with the newly formed Governments
of Esthonia, Far Eastern Republic, Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukrainia.
Conditions in Russia and Turkey are not yet sufficiently settled to
warrant the exchange of publications previously carried on between
the United States and these countries.

The number of boxes shipped abroad during the year was larger
than ever before, due largely to the opening of exchange relations
with Yugoslovia and certain of the independent Russian States,
the material for these countries having accumulated here for sev-
eral years.

The regular schedule of shipments to foreign countries was re-
sumed during the year. To Great Britain and Germany, shipments
are made weekly; to France and Italy, semimonthly; and to other
countries, monthly.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

The past year has been one of the most successful since the estab-
lishment of the park. The number of visitors exceeded 2,000,000;
the collection of animals is larger and more important than ever
before; a number of minor improvements have been completed and
progress made on certain larger projects; and the reservation itself
has been maintained in excellent condition. That the popularity
of the park as a source of recreation and instruction continues
unabated is shown by the fact that for the third consecutive year
the attendance has exceeded 2,000,000, and its increasing value as
a supplement to school-room instruction in natural history is demon-
strated by the 205 schools and classes visiting the park during the
year, with a total of 18,585 individuals.

The total number of animals on exhibition at the close of the year
was 1,681, representing 482 species of mammals, birds, and reptiles.
This is not only a larger number of individual animals than ever
shown before, but also a larger number of different species. Among
the 656 accessions received during the year, 217 were gifts. Among
these may be mentioned two important collections from South
America, one made by Dr. William M. Mann on the Mulford Bio-
logical Explorations of the Amazon Basin and presented by the
H. K. Mulford Co. of Philadelphia, the other made by Mr. W. J.
La Varre, jr., and presented by him. These two collections con-
tain several species of South American monkeys and birds never
before shown at the park. One hundred and fifty mammals, birds,
and reptiles were born in the park during the year.

Under the heading of improvements the report of the superin-
tendent mentions a large project of grading, leveling, and filling in

22 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

the west central part of the park, which was practically completed
during the year. This work makes available for the exhibition of
hoofed animals a large area of comparatively level ground. Also it
will be possible to greatly improve the main automobile road through
the park. Extensive repairs were completed on the antelope house
and the older bear dens. Three large outdoor cages were built for
certain birds, and many minor repairs were completed during the
year. The most urgent need of the park is now a suitable restaurant
building to accommodate the greatly increased crowds of visitors.
The present small building is in bad condition and is entirely in-
adequate to meet the needs of the public. A suitable building could
be erected, using lumber in the possession of the park and employing
the regular park force, for about $20,000. Another urgent need is
for a new bird house, the old building, erected many years ago as a
temporary relief, being in a very bad state of repair. Moreover, there
is not sufficient space for the very valuable and interesting collection
of birds and there is far too little room for visitors in the public
aisles.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The outstanding feature of the year’s work was the publication
of Volume IV of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observatory, a
quarto volume of 390 pages, which covers in detail the work of the
years 1912 to 1920. New instruments and methods of observing are
described and a mass of solar observations is presented and dis-
cussed. Many kinds of evidence are given to show the solar vari-
ability, and reference is made to applications of the results which
have been made by several meteorologists.

The observing station erected on Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz.,
through the generosity of Mr. John A. Roebling, has been much
improved, owing to the zeal of Mr. A. F. Moore, in charge of the
station. Solar constant observations were made on upward of 70 per
cent of the days of the year. Comparisons made during and after
a visit by the director show no change in the scale of pyrheliometry,
so that the results from this station are comparable with those at
Montezuma, Chile. Earlier in the year the director visited the
station at Montezuma, where he revised all the adjustments of appa-
ratus and some of the methods employed there.

In June the director and Mr. L. B. Aldrich proceeded to the
Smithsonian station on Mount Wilson, Calif., where a beginning
was made toward installing new “solar constant” apparatus to re-
place that removed to the new Arizona station in 1920. By antici-
pation it may be said that later results were secured on the dis-
tribution of energy in the spectra of 11 of the brighter stars by
bolometric work in connection with the hundred-inch telescope, and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

also that the solar-energy curve was traced bolometrically with both
glass and rock-salt prisms. The solar cooking apparatus on Mount
Wilson referred to in previous reports suffered the loss of the cover
of the oil reservoir through a high wind, and snow having gotten
in, much water had leaked into the oil reservoir. It proved im-
possible to remedy this condition soon enough to undertake the
proposed new experiments before the expedition returned to Wash-
ington in September.

In order to get the opinions of competent critics as to the value
of the Smithsonian solar radiation measurements, the director wrote
to the American representatives of the International Astronomical
Union as follows:

It is the intention of the Smithsonian Institution to continue daily observa-
tions at Mount Harqua Hala and Montezuma certainly until July, 1923, at
which time it is proposed to consider the state of the work and the results
reached with a view to deciding whether it is worth while to continue daily
observations of the variability of the sun indefinitely or whether the usefulness
of that work is unequal to the trouble and expense involved.

An expression of opinion on the part of those interested in the subject
would be of great value to the Smithsonian Institution in making this decision.

At a meeting in Washington the American representatives unani-
mously indorsed the work of the observatory, and later at Rome
the international representatives passed a resolution expressing the
same opinion. In view of these impartial indorsements of the
work, it is a pleasure to announce that Mr. John A. Roebling has
made it possible to assure the continuation of the solar constant
stations at Harqua Hala and Montezuma until July, 1925. By that
time it will doubtless be evident from the data obtained whether they
should be continued longer.

A movement is under way in Australia to establish a solar observ-
ing station there similar to the Smithsonian stations. The Meteoro-
logical Service of Argentina is also proposing to equip its station
at La Quiaca for solar observations, and it is expected that during
the next fiscal year two sets of solar constant apparatus will be pre-
pared for the Australian and Argentine stations.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC
LITERATURE.

In the statement last year regarding the International Catalogue
of Scientific Literature reference was made to the very apparent
need of cooperation between organizations publishing abstracts to
scientific literature and the International Catalogue. This year in
the annual report of the United States regional bureau suggestions
are made for an even greater consolidation of bibliographical inter-
24 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

ests. Although the combination of interests suggested would make
a very large organization, there is nothing new or radical in the pro-
posed move; it is simply an attempt to harmonize numerous plans
and suggestions, all of which aim to supply aids to investigators
and students in the at present difficult task of finding the published
records of what has been done in the various fields of research.

The need of prompt and reliable aid is keenly apparent, and while
in some subjects satisfactory aids are available in others they do
not exist.

It now appears that the organization of the International Cata-
logue of Scientific Literature may be kept in working condition,
although it is not yet possible to resume publication on account of
financial conditions. Pending the resumption of publication it is
felt that through the large number of regional agencies much con-
structive work may be done by using their influence and efforts in
bringing about cooperation among similar organizations dealing with
any of the subjects embraced within the scope of the International
Catalogue.

NECROLOGY. *
JOHN A. ELSTON.

John A. Elston, Representative in the Congress from California
and Regent of the Smithsonian Institution since January 9, 1920,
died in December, 1921. Although a member of the Board of
Regents for such a brief period, Mr. Elston took a real and active
interest in the affairs of the Institution.

JOSEPH B. LEAVY.

Joseph B. Leavy, philatelist in the National Museum since 1913,
died July 25, 1921, after a lingering illness. Mr. Leavy was edu-
cated at Columbia University, and later entered into business, in
which he continued for several years. He served in the Army during
the Spanish War.

To him is due the credit for the excellent installation of the large
collection of stamps in the Museum, which includes specimens of all
new issues sent to the Post Office Department from various foreign
Governments.

JAMES MOONEY.

James Mooney, ethnologist in the Bureau of American Ethnology,
died on December 22, 1921. Mr. Mooney was born in Indiana in
1861, and became associated with the bureau in 1885, shortly after
its organization by Major Powell. He remained a member of the
staff from that time until his death.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

Mr. Mooney was very widely read regarding the history of the
aborigines north of Mexico, being equaled by few perhaps in this
particular field. His information was most extensive, however, re-
garding the Indians of the southeastern woodlands and the Great
Plains, and he was the leading authority on one tribe in each area,
the Cherokee and the Kiowa. Several of Mr. Mooney’s investigations
published by the bureau are standard works in their special field.

He was one of the founders of the American Anthropological As-
sociation, a member and ex-president of the Anthropological Society
of Washington, and a member of the Mississippi Valley Historical
Association. Mr. Mooney’s death brings to a premature close a not-
able scientific career.

THOMAS F, HANEY.

Thomas F. Haney, preparator in the National Museum for over
28 years, died October 8, 1921. During his service for the Museum,
Mr. Haney constructed many difficult large-size models illustrating
the occurrence, mining, and manufacture of various mineral re-
sources. His skill and minutely detailed work in this field of educa-
tional exhibits will be greatly missed.

ANDREW L, FANT.

Andrew L. Fant, watchman, a faithful and efficient employee in
the National Museum since 1893 and lieutenant of the watch force
since 1903, died on October 6, 1921.

APPENDIX 1.
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the United States National Museum for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1922.

The year, a busy one, was marked by the multiplicity of activities,
and advancement is shown in a number of directions. As set forth
in the last report, the Museum is receiving practically the same ap-
propriation that it did 11 years ago, in spite of increased scope, addi-
tional collections, and advanced cost of all material and labor neces-
sary to its maintenance. That the Museum attains the fine results
recorded from year to year is owing, in large measure, to the personal
qualities of the members of its staff, to whom much credit is due.

The organization and staff of the Museum have undergone no note-
worthy changes; policy and plans have remained opportunistic in
the absence of funds to enable them to be considered in advance.

Of prime importance this year was the receipt and installation
of the Herbert Ward collection of sculptures of African natives
and of African ethnological specimens. Like the bequest of James
Smithson to the United States, this gift from a British subject to
the American people is unique and deserves mention also as a won-
derful representation of the native dignity of an aborginal race,
typical of all aborigines. Its installation is noteworthy as marking
an advance in the display of such objects.

A beginning was made under the terms of the will of Dr. Morris
Loeb for the establishment of the Loeb collection of chemical types
in the National Museum. This collection forms a separate entity in
the department of arts and industries. An advisory committee
cooperates in its management, consisting of Dr. C. L. Alsberg, chair-
man; Dr. Victor Lenher, Mr. James K. Senior, Dr. G. C. Spencer,
representing the Bureau of Chemistry of the Department of Agri-
culture; and Mr. F. L. Lewton, representing the Museum and in
charge of the collection.

The two specially constructed storage cabinets were received from
the Chemists’ Club of New York City, and a portion of the original
material of each of seven new chemical compounds, discovered and
prepared in the Department of Agriculture, were transferred to the

26
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 27

Loeb collection. The members of the committee have offered to
solicit additional original chemical material for the series. Ar-
rangements were made with trade journals for advance notice of the
publication of new chemical compounds, in order to facilitate prompt
solicitation.

Steps were taken to have greater use made of the facilities af-
forded Washington by the National Museum. Through arrange-
ments with the authorities of the public schools of the District of
Columbia the Museum, when notified in advance, furnishes expert
guidance by a member of its staff to scholars and teachers visiting
its halls. In some instances such visits have resulted in further
work along similar lines after the return to their school buildings
and on several occasions have been followed by talks to the students
in their classrooms by members of the staff of the Museum. Through
cooperation with the Wild Flower Preservation Society of America,
the Audubon Society of the District of Columbia, and the American
Forestry Association, the Museum arranged a series of six Saturday
morning lectures in the auditorium of the Museum for honor pupils
of the seventh and eighth grades of the public schools, and the
American Forestry Association awarded blue ribbons for the best
bird houses submitted by the pupils.

The schools of Washington, in common with the higher educa-
tional establishments of the country, have long shared the benefits
of the duplicate specimens distributed by the Museum for educa-
tional purposes, and this year was no exception.

The value of the Museum to the commercial interests of the Na-
tional Capital, as well as to its educational interests, was demon:
strated by a series of lectures by the curator of textiles given to
several groups of employees handling textiles in one of the large
department stores of the city, who, at the solicitation of their firm,
came to the Museum during business hours for the purpose.

The influence of the Museum in education is being felt outside
its immediate vicinity, through the large delegations of students
visiting it annually, often as part of their courses of instruction, and
also through its assistance in the preparation of textbooks. Photo-
graphs and essential data of the exhibits pertaining to the mineral}
industries were supplied to the Pennsylvania State Board of Edu-
cation, and to other inquirers.

President Harding, on October 24, 1921, under authority of the
legislative, executive, and judicial appropriation bill for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1913, directed the Bureau of Efficiency to pre-
scribe a uniform system of employee ratings for all departments,
and requested the heads of the departments to put the system into
effect. Ratings were first to be established for employees engaged
28 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922,

in clerical or routine work, such as clerks, stenographers, book-
keepers, messengers, and skilled laborers, and afterwards to be ex-
tended to employees engaged in professional, scientific, technical,
administrative, or executive work, or any other work involving
for the most part original or constructive effort. This was inaugu-
rated by a survey of all the positions existing in the Museum on
November 15, 1921, carefully prepared and submitted to the Bureau
of Efficiency. An initial report on the efficiency of each employee
was made dating May 15, 1922, and similar reports are to be made
every six months hereafter. The installation of this system added
considerably to the duties of the officials of the Museum.

The changing of the system of keeping Government accounts, to
make the items of expenditure identical in all Government offices,
whether large or small, likewise, temporarily at least, added to the
work this year in the administrative office. Efforts were also made
toward unifying other business methods of the Government offices
generally, as to the handling of supplies, traffic matters, etc.

BUILDINGS AND EQUIPMENT.

The National Museum completely occupies two large and two small
buildings, besides considerable space in two other structures. The
combined floor space is approximately 670,000 square feet. To keep
these buildings in repair requires all the available appropriation,
so that radical changes in arrangements, however much needed, are
almost impossible. This year by the removal of one partition and
the erection of another, two small exhibition halls were added to the
floor space for the display of specimens in the Arts and Industries
Building, though the storage space was correspondingly diminished.
Other repairs consisted, as usual, of repainting of walls and ceilings
in places where most needed, the replacing of certain worn-out floors,
and repairs to roofs, gutters, etc. The hot-water heating system was
extended to the concrete building in the east court of the Natural
History Building, replacing the temporary heating arrangements
installed there when the structure was erected during the World War.

In the Natural History Building a thorough investigation was
made of the dome and the great piers supporting it. The slight
displacement of the stone arches which span the piers, the opening
of joints at the end of the balustrades under these arches and in the
fourth-story floor at the ends of the piers, have been brought about
by a movement at the upper end of the piers, doubtless caused by the
eccentric application of the weight of the dome. The piers are
fully braced by a large number of steel beams to the walls of the
building and, since the walls are successfully resisting the pressure
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 29

from the piers, the movement of the latter, it is believed, will
probably not proceed much farther. Careful observations and
measurements will, however, be made at intervals of a few months
to determine if any further displacement occurs.

By the acquisition of 37 exhibition cases and 116 pieces of storage,
laboratory, and office furniture, there were on hand at the close of
the year 3,679 exhibition cases and 11,572 pieces of storage, labora-
tory, office, and other furniture, besides 83,500 drawers, trays, boxes,
and wing frames.

COLLECTIONS.

The total number of specimens acquired by the Museum during
the year was approximately 359,676. Additional material to the
extent of 995 lots, chiefly geological, was received for special exam-
ination and report. Nearly 20,000 specimens were lent to special-
ists for study, mainly on behalf of the Museum, and about 33,000
specimens were sent out in exchange, for which the Museum re-
ceived valuable material. Over 10,000 duplicate specimens were
used as gifts to educational establishments. Of these nearly half
were contained in regular sets of labeled material previously pre-
pared for shipment, and the remainder comprised specially selected
lots to meet particular cases. The duplicates were chiefly fossil
invertebrates, minerals, and ores, material illustrating rock weather-
ing and soil formation, miscellaneous geological material, mollusks,
and marine invertebrates, with smaller lots of specimens from the
collections of insects, mammals, fishes, birds, archeology, ethnology,
textiles, physical anthropology, and wood technology.

Anthropology.—Collections in unusual number and of scientific
value were received by the department. of anthropology. Especially
worthy of praise is the Herbert Ward African collection, hereto-
fore mentioned, given to the Museum by Mrs. Herbert Ward.
This collection, forming one of the most important ethnological
units in the world, was begun by Herbert Ward in Africa during
the first great period of exploitation by Livingstone and Stanley.
It consists of 2,700 specimens of African ethnologica and is illus-
trated by 19 superb sculptures in bronze by Mr. Ward. The whole
collection is displayed to advantage in the halls of ethnology in
the Natural History Building.

Through the friendly offices of the Archeological Society of
Washington, the division of American archeology received a large
collection of the brilliant ancient pottery from the ruins of Casas
Grandes, Chihuahua, Mexico. The remarkable aboriginal ceramics
collected by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes in the neighboring region, the
Mimbres Valley, N. Mex., were placed on public view. From the
30 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

National Geographic Society’s expedition in Chaco Canyon, N.
Mex., conducted by Mr. Neil M. Judd, considerable material was
forwarded.

An ornate gilt bronze statue of Buddha from the Imperial Palace
at Peking, containing rolls of inscribed prayers, was received by
the division of Old World archeology from Maj. Murray Warner
through Mrs. Gertrude Bass Warner, of Eugene, Oreg.

Mr. Hugo Worch has added a number of pianos to his collection,
and especially noteworthy is a magnificent gilt harpischord made
by Pleyel, Paris, France. The collection of violins bequeathed to
the Museum under the terms of the will of Dwight J. Partello
was lost to the Museum, as it was found that through a previous
bill of sale the collection belonged to one of his daughters.

In art textiles mention should be made of a collection of speci-
mens of lace of high class, a permanent deposit by Miss Emily
G. Storrow. In ceramics a selection of American art pottery was
supplied for the exhibit of the National Gallery of Art.

A special exhibit of tiles made in the United States and assem-
bled by the Associated Tile Manufacturers to illustrate the result
of 44 years’ development of an American industry was shown
from May 16 to June 20, 1922, in two rooms off the foyer in the
Natural History Building.

Biology—From the numerical standpoint the collections of the
department of biology show less uniform and healthy growth than
during the fiscal year 1921. The actual number of specimens re-
veived, 318,950, represents, it is true, an increase over the previous
year, but this increase is only 67,437, while the year 1921 showed
an increase of no less than 114,720 over its predecessor.

Together with the decrease in relative increment has gone a gen-
eral decrease in the scientific importance of the new accessions.
Three curators regard this importance as increased over that of
the previous year’s accessions, but only one of these (insects) feels
called upon to express enthusiasm. Of the six others five report
essentially stationary conditions and one (fishes) a falling off.

The great outstanding feature among this year’s accessions is
the collection of about 100,000 insects of all orders, made by Dr.
William M. Mann in South America, chiefly in eastern Bolivia.
In Alaska another unusually important collection of insects was
obtained by Dr. John M. Aldrich. The final consignment of Mr.
Hoy’s Australian material (mostly vertebrates) presented by Dr.
William L. Abbott, brings the important and successful Australian
expedition to a close.

The National Herbarium through cooperation with the Depart-
ment of Agriculture acquired the very large private herbarium of
Dr. Otto Buchtien of over 45,000 specimens, rich in material from
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. $i

Bolivia, Chile, and Paraguay, the Bolivian flora being particularly
well represented.

Many other smaller collections were received, including mammals
from Alberta and plants from British Columbia collected by Sec-
retary and Mrs.: Walcott.

The work of remedying defects in the biological exhibition has
been practically confined to the mammal halls. Good progress has
been made in routine curatorial and preparatorial work in the
various collections, but everywhere this work is suffering from the
insufficiency of space and of personnel.

Geology.—A satisfactory increase in the geological collections is
noted, although the accessions number slightly less than last year,
217, with an aggregate of 23,504 specimens being recorded.

Valuable additions were made to the collections of Bolivian tin
and tungsten ores by Mr. F. L. Hess; rich examples of carnotite and
hewettite, the best thus far found in the United States, were acquired
through the generosity of the Standard Chemical Co., Naturita,
Colo.; and large uranophane-bearing sandstone specimens were pre-
sented by Mr. John J. Bonner, Lusk, Wyo. Gold nuggets, eight in
number, the largest weighing 44 ounces, from the Maxwell Land
Grant, N. Mex., were donated by Dr. Frank Springer, and Hon.
Holm O. Bursum presented examples of torbernite, a radium-bearing
mineral from White Signal, N. Mex. Other gifts to the economic
collections include examples of diamond-bearing rock from Pike
County, Ark., and slabs of building stones supplied by various
dealers.

The most notable addition to the meteorite collection is the mag-
nificent mass of iron from Owens Valley, Calif., gift of Mr. Lincoln
Ellsworth, New York City. Examples of other falls and finds, 10
in number, either new to the collection or hitherto poorly represented,
were acquired chiefly through exchanges.

The mineral collections were benefited through gifts which in-
clude at least three exhibition specimens. Large fine crystals of
colemanite, donated by Mr. W. S. Russell, Los Angeles, an attractive
specimen of cuprite showing deep red crystals on native copper, by
Dr. R. O. Hall, San Jose, Calif., and a zoned rhodenite of unusual
form, by Col. Washington A. Roebling, Trenton, N. J., are notable
among these. Valuable foreign minerals were acquired through
exchange; type materials were transferred by the United States
Geological Survey; a series showing the effect of radium rays on
the color of minerals, beryl crystals from Brazil, and examples of
nesquehonite, demantoid garnet, and other forms from Italy were
acquired by purchase; and interesting collections were made in the
field by the assistant curator. Gems of beauty and value have
been added to the Isaac Lea collection through its endowment fund,
32 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

including a series of uncut diamonds from the mines of the Arkansas
Diamond Corporation, Murfreesboro, Ark.; a unique cut gem of
orthoclase from Madagascar; a blue zircon from Australia; and a
series of fresh-water pearls from the rivers of the Mississippi Valley.
A number of individual gifts are also recorded.

Paleontological material was received from Mexico, Central and
South America, India, and several European localities, these being
chiefly Mesozoic and Cenozoic, while numerous collections from
Paleozoic rocks of the United States and Canada were made by the
curator or presented by interested friends. Unusually well pre-
served cetacean remains obtained in the Miocene deposits along
Chesapeake Bay; valuable reptilian material acquired by exchanges;
skulls and bones of extinct buffaloes, presented by the John A.
Savage Co., Crosby, Minn.; and remains of the Beresovka mam-
moth, are among the notable accessions of vertebrate material.

Mineral and mechanical technology.—tin the division of mineral
technology attention was confined entirely to a more permanent
and complete arrangement of the exhibits already on hand, and
new material consisted chiefly of photographic transparencies which
were installed in the respective exhibits to which they referred.
Apart from this work, the division was chiefly engaged in coopera-
tive educational work with the Pennsylvania State Board of Edu-
cation through Mr. Samuel S. Wyer, of Columbus, Ohio. The
plans of the State Educational Board call for revision of the sev-
enth-grade geography course to include the study of the State’s
mineral resources. The extent of the division’s cooperation may
be judged from the fact that it has supplied a considerable amount
of the data for text and illustrations from the models of the many
mineral industries exhibited in the Museum.

The division of mechanical technology was extremely busy, pri-
marily, in regrouping its collections and rearranging objects in the
collections so as to tell a story rather than merely represent a
period in development, in an endeavor to impress the student with
the significance of the material rather than its mere existence;
and, secondarily, through the receipt of over 100 per cent more
objects than were received the preceding year. In the line of
special investigations, those inaugurated last year, particularly with
regard to the developments in aeronautical engineering, were con-
tinued.

Textiles, wood technology, foods, and medicine.—The collections
under the supervision of the curator of textiles, which, besides
textiles, embrace wood technology, food, medicine, and miscellaneous
organic products, were increased by many gifts and by transfer
and loan of property from other Government bureaus amounting
to nearly 3,000 objects. The most important of these are as follows:
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

From the Department of Commerce, several hundred specimens
of industrial raw materials not heretofore represented in the col-
lections, which had been sent to the department by American con-
sular offices and trade commissioners for the purpose of encourag-
ing foreign commerce. There were added by gift beautiful speci-
mens of silks, fur fabrics, and drapery textiles contributed by
American manufacturers to show the progress of textile industries
in this country.

To the collections arranged to show the importance of wood and
the industries based upon the use of that raw material, there were
added two series of specimens illustrating the manufacture and use
of sulphite wood pulp for writing papers, one showing in detail
the steps in the process, and the other the exact quantities of each
ingredient entering into 100 pounds of finished paper; also exhibits
showing the importance and uses of American walnut, many ex-
amples of articles turned from wood, and specimens of laminated
wood wheels for motor vehicles.

The collections in the division of medicine were enlarged by ex-
tensive series of specimens showing the manufacture of surgical
dressings, pills, plasters, surgical ligatures, and clinical thermome-
ters; specimens of essential oils and related aromatic substances;
important alkaloids and alkaloidal salts used in medicine; and a
series of charts showing the treatment of rabies, typhoid fever, and
whooping cough.

Graphic arts—The specimens acquired in the division, while less
than half in number, are still fully as important, artistically and
technically, as the 1920-21 specimens. The most important indi-
vidual gift was that of the sixteenth century methods of making
type, in which all the specimens were made by or prepared by Mr.
Dard Hunter, Chillicothe, Ohio. Mr. Hunter himself made the
punches, struck the matrices, and cast the type. This is one of a
series consisting of printer’s ink, paper, and type making, which,
with the promised modern methods of type making, will be about
complete. Several gifts combined have greatly improved both the
technical and historical series of collotype. The Campbell Art Co.,
of Elizabeth, N. J., gave a valuable and instructive technical exhibit
of color printing, and beautiful examples of the process were also
furnished by Foster Bros., of Boston, the Medici Society of America
(Inc.), and by Rudolf Lesch, of New York City. These are ex-
amples of the finest collotype work being produced to-day, and
make an excellent showing of this process of photomechanical re-
production. A new process for reprinting books has been developed
by the Polygraphic Co., of Berne, Switzerland, who donated a com-
plete exhibit. In this so-called Manul process the negative is ob-
34 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

tained upon a sheet of very thin paper without the use of a camera
or lens.

The series of pictorial photographs collected this year, over 100
in number, is a very important collection of artistic photography
representing 17 of the foremost pictorial photographers of the
world. The successful collection of this material was largely due
to efforts and suggestions of Mr. Floyd Vail, of the New York
Camera Club. The gift by Maj. Murray Warner through Mrs.
Gertrude Bass Warner of 42 autochromes, the work of Major
Warner, deserves mention, as they preserve the wonderful color
schemes of the Panama-Pacific Exposition, as well as being fine
specimens. A loan from Mr. Earle W. Huckel, of Philadelphia, of
several printed books contains one dated 1497, Theology, by Lock-
mayer, which is the earliest book in the division; also a beautiful
book from the famous Moretus Press dated 1696. The most beau-
tiful example of presswork and typography shown is a copy of The
Well at the World’s End, printed by William Morris at the Kelm-
scott Press in 1896.

Many small and individual objects have augmented various
series, adding to their extent and beauty, as, for example, two beau-
tiful water colors by Mr. W. H. Holmes, Director of the National
Gallery of Art, and a black and white original, loaned by Franklin
Booth.

One hundred photographs of snow crystals, by Mr. W. A. Bent-
ley, form a valuable addition to the technical collections. A
notable loan exhibit of artistic photography, the work of Mr.
Floyd Vail, was shown for two months and attracted much at-
tention.

History.—During the past fiscal year, the historical collections
have received a number of additions of more than usual interest
and importance. These include the following: The American flag,
which, after receiving military honors in the Sorbonne in the
presence of President Poincaré, was flown with a French flag at
the summit of the Eiffel Tower and saluted with 101 guns, April
22, 1917, in celebration of the entry of the United States into the
World War on the side of the Allies. This flag was presented by
the French ambassador, M. Jusserand, to President Harding at
the White House on Decoration Day, May 30, 1922, and deposited
in the Museum by the President. A series of very handsome silk
American flags, presented to Gen. John J. Pershing in recognition
of his services as commander-in-chief of the American Expedition-
ary Forces in France during the World War and loaned to the
Museum by him. Two sectional relief maps of northern France,
one made of papier-maché and one of plaster, presented by Mar-
shal Haig and Marshal Petain, respectively, to the Hon. Medill
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 85

McCormick, and by him presented to the Museum. The first of
these consists of eight sections, 22 by 27 inches in size, showing
when united the territory bordering the British battle front from
Dunkirk to Amiens. The second consists of 111 sections, each 19
by 25 inches, and shows the region of the French front from
Vermand to Courgenay, in great detail. Another relief map of
much importance is one received from the United States Marine
Corps, showing the region about Belleau Wood. The numismatic
collections relative to the World War have been increased by a
number of examples of the medals and decorations issued in the
United States and European countries during the war.

The original historical collections have been increased by a sword
carried during the War of the Revolution by General Washington, a
cane bequeathed to him by Benjamin Franklin, and a sword owned
by Gen. Andrew Jackson. These three objects were transferred to
the Museum from the Department of State by joint resolution of
Congress approved February 28, 1922. From the same department
by transfer was received the small writing desk used by Thomas
Jefferson when he drafted the Declaration of Independence in Phil-
adelphia in 1776, which bears a memorandum in his own hand at-
testing to its history. A single addition was made during the year
to the collection of costumes worn by the mistresses of the White
House. This was the dress worn by Mrs. Andrew Jackson, jr., on
the occasion of a reception given at the White House in her honor
in 1831, and lent to the Museum by Mrs. Rachel Jackson Lawrence,
of the Hermitage Association.

Work on the collections.—The care and preservation of the collec-
tions require a large proportion of the energies and time of the
scientific staff and present many difficulties to be surmounted. In
ethnology, the installation of the Herbert Ward collection led to a
recasting of the African collection generally. The conditions ham-
pering the development of the biological exhibition since the later
years of the World War have continued, making it impossible to
do more than remedy special defects as opportunity presented. A
general overhauling of the unmounted larger cetacean material has
placed this series in a condition to be used for the first time in many
years. Commendable progress is reported in the care of the geologi-
cal collections, though comparatively few new exhibits were in-
stalled.

The assignment of the entire east gallery of the Arts and In-
dustries Building for the use of the division of medicine necessi-
tated a complete rearrangement of all the cases and the installation
of a number of new exhibits. In the division of mechanical tech-
nology a complete inventory was made of the collections, the Museum
catalogues as far back as 1876 being carefully examined and checked
36 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

with the specimens. The collections of graphic arts on display in
the Smithsonian Building were rearranged so that exhibits of a
kind, both historical and technical, are located near together for easy
examination.

The classification of the collections by members of the staff has
produced the usual amount of research work on the materia! in-
trusted to their care; and the usual generous cooperation of out-
siders has been of the utmost assistance in enhancing the scientific
value of the collections. The total number of papers by members
of the staff, or based partly or wholly on National Museum material
by outsiders, published during the year is 332.

EXPLORATIONS AND FIELD WORK.

From the standpoint of exploration and expeditions, the year just
completed shows very little improvement over 1920-21. The work
carried on by various other governmental agencies, particularly by
the United States Geological Survey, the Bureau of Fisheries, the
Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture, and the Bureau
of American Ethnology has, as usual, resulted in important material
for the national collections.

The number of expeditions contributing material to the depart-
ment of biology, according to the reports of curators, was 18, of
which no less than 10 were both financed and directed by outside
friends and correspondents, 7 were financed by others and partly
or wholly directed by members of the staff of the Museum, while
only 1 was entirely controlled by the Museum. In the department
of geology, extensive field work was confined entirely to the division
of paleontology.

Besides the field work described here, a number of other expedi-
tions in which the Museum was interested are mentioned in the first
part of this report under the heading “ Explorations and researches.”

The work of Mr. Arthur de C. Sowerby in China, interrupted by
the World War, was resumed, a shipment of specimens from the
Province of Fukien being received. The expenses of this work are
met by Mr. Robert Sterling Clark, who generously contributes all
the material to the Museum. Special effort is being directed to
securing vertebrates from southern and other parts of China not
hitherto represented in the national collections.

Dr. William M. Mann, while attached to the Mulford Biological
Exploration of the Amazon Basin, collected a large number of insects
and some miscellaneous material of other kinds. This expedition
was organized by the H. K. Mulford Co., of Philadelphia, under the
direction of Dr. H. H. Rusby, chiefly for the purpose of studying
drug plants, but also for making general biological collections. By
invitation, Doctor Mann was attached as entomologist and assistant
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ai

director and during the last 3 of the 10 months of the expedition
was in charge, on account of the illness of Doctor Rusby.

Dr. Paul Bartsch continued his experiments in heredity on iand
mollusks. of the genus Cerion, under the joint auspices of the Smith-
sonian Institution and the Carnegie Institution, of Washington. He
has been working upon a survey of the distribution of the native
species in the Florida Keys. By the use of a seaplane, detailed for
the purpose by the Navy Department, Doctor Bartsch was able in
four days to fly at low altitude over the entire region and note on
charts all the visible grass plots—the habitat of the Cerions. It will
now be possible by means of the charts to examine the native colonies
without loss of time in locating them. Mr. John B. Henderson,
Regent of the Smithsonian Institution, made a rather hurried trip
to Jamaica +o personally collect living specimens of the Helicid
genus Thysanophora for anatomical study toward a proposed mono-
graph of the group. This little expedition proved unusually success-
ful and of great benefit to the work in hand, as well as to the mollusk
collections.

Mr. Paul C. Standley carried on botanical exploration in Central
America, through cooperation with the Gray Herbarium, the New
York Botanical Garden, the Bureau of Plant Industry of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and Mr. Oakes Ames, the latter being interested
in the orchids of this region. About five months were spent in E]
Salvador, and nearly a month in Guatemala. The collections, over
6,000 botanical specimens, will be divided among the contributing
institutions.

Another botanical expedition was in the field at the close of the
vear. Dr. F. W. Pennell, of the Philadelphia Academy of Natural
Sciences, accompanied by Mrs. Pennell, and Mr. KE. P. Killip. of the
Museum, is conducting a six months’ exploration of western Colombia,
on behalf of the Gray Herbarium, the New York Botanical Garden,
the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences, and the Museum.
Mr. Oakes Ames is contributing also to the expense of the expedition.
This is one of a series toward a complete study of the flora of north-
ern South America.

The biological expedition alluded to as the only one under the
exclusive control of the Museum was a trip to the interior of Alaska
undertaken by Dr. John M. Aldrich, associate curator of insects.
The Alaska Engineering Commission of the Department of the In-
terior furnished Doctor Aldrich with horses and their subsistence and
with transportation on the Alaskan Railroad. About 10,000 speci-
mens were collected, consisting mainly of Diptera and Hymenoptera.
with a fair number of Hemiptera.

The expedition of the Museum of the American Indian (Heye
Foundation) to New Mexico under Mr. F. W. Hodge furnished

58379—24—_4
38 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

valuable skeletal material, as has been the case for several years
past. The exploration of Pueblo Bonito in the Chaco Canyon,
N. Mex., by the National Geographic Society under the direction of
Mr. Neil M. Judd during the summer of 1921 was largely prelimi-
nary. The exploration will be continued through a number of sea-
sons and the collections are to become the property of the National
Museum.

Early in the year Mr. F. W. Foshag collected minerals from
interesting cave deposits in the Grand Canyon, near Supai, Ariz.,
a project made possible through the courtesy of Mr. C. A. Heber-
lein, operating in the region. Mr. Foshag also made field trips to
southern California and Nevada in connection with research work
at the University of California, the results of which were likewise
added to the national collections.

Doctor Bassler spent his vacation in July, 1921, in geological field-
work in the central basin of Tennessee, under the auspices of the
Geological Survey of that State. The field offered such opportunities
that arrangements were made for another summer’s work in the
same general area. During the greater part of June, 1922, there-
fore Doctor Bassler, in company with Dr. E. O. Ulrich and Mr.
R. D. Messler, of the United States Geological Survey, was occupied
in making stratigraphic sections and collecting fossils over the en-
tire central basin, an area of about 8,000 square miles. The ultimate
object of this work is the preparation of a monograph on the
stratigraphy and paleontology of Tennessee. On the completion
of his work in Tennessee, in 1921, Doctor Bassler proceeded to
Springfield, Il., where casts of type specimens in the State museum
collections were made, in accordance with the department’s plan
to complete so far as possible the representation of type specimens
in the national collections. Through the courtesy of Mr. E. J.
Armstrong, of Erie, Pa., Doctor Bassler visited all the classical
Silurian and Devonian localities in northwestern Pennsylvania and
western New York during the latter part of September to obtain
field knowledge of the detailed geology and to collect carefully se-
lected sets of fossils illustrating the numerous formations of the
region. The work was highly successful, and the large collections
of Devonian fossils in the Museum concerning which exact strati-
graphic data have been lacking can now be determined and arranged
in necessary detail.

Dr. E. O. Ulrich, of the United States Geological Survey, spent
the summer of 1921 in continuation of his field researches on the
early Paleozoic rocks of eastern North America, and previous to
joining Doctor Bassler in Tennessee, as noted above, studied the
Silurian stratigraphy of Pennsylvania and Maryland. Mr. N. H.
Boss made several short trips collecting in the Miocene deposits
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

along the Chesapeake Bay, all of which were under the auspices of
the National Museum. These trips were unusually productive in
the recovery of well-preserved cetacean remains.

___ Dr. George P. Merrill did a little work on his own initiative while
in Maine on a vacation, and Mr. Shannon on a two-day trip to
Port Deposit and Conowingo, Md., and Peach Bottom, Pa., visited
a number of commercial granite, feldspar, talc, and slate mines and
quarries.

MEETINGS, CONGRESSES, AND RECEPTIONS.

The Museum is seldom able to arrange regular lecture courses, but
it does diffuse much knowledge through the lectures and proceedings
of the various governmental, scientific, and educational agencies
using its meeting facilities. The auditorium and adjacent council
rooms afforded accommodations during the year for about 150 meet-
ings, covering a wide range of subjects.

The governmental agencies availing themselves of these opportuni-
ties included the State Department, the War Department, the Treas-
ury Department, the Department of Agriculture, the Department of
Labor, the Interdepartmental Social Hygiene Board, and the Federal
Power Commission. The scientific and technical groups included
the National Academy of Sciences, the National Research Council,
the American Relief Administration, the International Association
for Identification, the American Surgical Association, the American
Federation of Arts, the Wild Flower Preservation Society of
America, the National Association of Postmasters of the United
States, the National Association of Office Managers, the Liberty
Calendar Association of America, the George Washington Memorial
Association, the Committee on the Baird Memorial, the Organizing
Committee of the Nineteenth International Congress of Ameri-
canists, the Anthropological Society of Washington, the Archzo-
logical Society of Washington, the Audubon Society of the District
of Columbia, the Biological Society of Washington, the Chemical
Society of Washington, the Entomological Society of Washington,
the Federal Photographic Society, the Organization of Appointment
Clerks, the Philosophical Society of Washington, the Shakespeare
Society of Washington, and the Washington Academy of Sciences.
The educational and miscellaneous agencies included the American
University ; the School of Foreign Service and the School of Medi-
cine of the Georgetown University; the Federation of Citizens Asso-
ciations; the General Federation of Women’s Clubs; the Potomac
Garden Club; the George Washington Post No. 1, American Legion;
the Matrons and Patrons Association of 1922, Order Eastern Star;
the Smithsonian branch of the Federal Employees Union No. 2; the
40 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

Smithsonian Auxiliary of the District of Columbia Chapter of the
American Red Cross; and the Smithsonian Relief Association.

The Museum was the scene of several receptions, the first being
probably the largest, the most elaborate, and the most successful
affair of its kind ever held in the Museum. This was the reception
on November 28, 1921, by the city of Washington, through the Com-
missioners of the District of Columbia and a committee of citizens,
to the delegates to the International Conference for the Limitation
of Armament, when some 5,000 persons representing the official,
social, and business life of Washington showed respect to the dele-
gates to that conference.

On the evening of February 18, 1922, an informal reception and
private view of the collection of Chihuahua pottery, loaned to the
Museum by the Archeological Society of Washington was held in
the public exhibition halls on the first floor. This was preceded by
a lecture in the hall below by Dr. Hamilton Bell, on the Sculpture
of Japan, under the auspices of the Archeological Society.

Another reception, on April 24, formed part of the program of the
annual meeting of the National Academy of Sciences. This was in
honor of Dr. and Mrs. H. A. Lorentz, of Leiden, and followed a
lecture in the auditorium by Doctor Lorentz on Problems of Modern
Physics.

A function which brought to the Museum representatives of the
diplomatic corps and others was the formal presentation to the
American Nation, on March 1, of the Herbert Ward collection of
sculptures and African ethnology. In the northeast corner, first
story, of the Natural History Building, surrounded by the works of
her gifted husband and his unrivaled collection illustrating the
handicrafts of the native African, the presentation was made by
Mrs. Ward, and the donation accepted by Vice President Coolidge
as chancellor of the Institution.

MISCELLANEOUS.

The publications issued by the Museum comprised 9 volumes and
78 separate papers. The Museum distribution of volumes and sepa-
rates to libraries and individuals aggregated 97,806 copies. This,
however, by no means indicates the number of its publications put in
circulation during the year, for one of the separates of the Proceed-
ings, on the Mosquitoes of the United States, issued in June, proved
so popular that the War and Navy Departments arranged through
the Superintendent of Documents for liberal distributions of the
paper, and the Bureau of Public Health reprinted it.

The library received 2,023 volumes and 4,185 pamphlets, mainly
through gifts and exchanges, bringing the Museum collection up to
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 4]

60,681 books and 95,594 pamphlets. Typewritten lists of original
articles appearing in scientific periodicals reaching the Institution

“for the Smithsonian deposit at the Library of Congress have been
circulated among the head curators of the Museum for their informa-
tion and dissemination among the staff generally. There is a demand
from other Government departments and research organizations for
zopies of these lists which the Museum is unable to supply, through
lack of mechanical equipment and assistants.

The number of visitors to the Natural History Building was
441,604; to the Arts and Industries Building, 262,151; to the Smith-
sonian Building, 83,384; and to the Aircraft Building, 46,380. All
the Museum exhibition halls are open free to the public every week-
day in the year. In addition those in the Natural History Building
are open every Sunday afternoon, and this year those in the Smith-
sonian Building were open on Sunday afternoons in April. All the
Museum offices and exhibition halls were closed, however, on Novem-
ber 11, 1921, on account of the burial of America’s unknown soldier.

APPENDIX 2.
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART.

Sm: I have the honor to submit the following report on the af-
fairs of the National Gallery of Art for the year ending June 30,
1922.

The second year of the existence of the National Gallery as a
separate administrative unit of the Smithsonian Institution closed
with substantial reasons for satisfaction with the progress made,
notwithstanding the fact that the accessions of art works fall short
of the average for a number of previous years. The activities of
the gallery continued in all essential respects in directions identical
with those of the preceding year, the personnel being limited to a
director and a secretary with clerical assistance, a guard, three
watchmen, two laborers, and two charwomen.

Full information regarding the inception and growth of the gal-
lery within the Institution and as a subsection of the department of
anthropology of the National Museum may be found in the report
of the secretary of the Institution for the preceding year, and more
especially in an earlier publication (Bulletin 70, U. S. National
Museum) prepared by former assistant secretary, Dr. Richard
Rathbun. |

Although art was recognized as a legitimate field of activity in
the organization of the Institution, and on equal terms with science,
and although numerous paintings and other works were acquired as
the years passed, no special provision was made for their accommoda-
tion, space being assigned them in various places as the years passed,
and no special provision was made for adding to the collection by
purchase. Since the completion of the Natural History Building the
collections have found space in that building, finally occupying the
large central hall which was subdivided by screen partitions for
their accommodation. This resource has, however, reached its limit,
and additions accepted can find exhibition space only by storing
the less important works previously acquired. This condition is
most unfortunate since the inflow of gifts and bequests, upon which
the gallery depends for accessions, is governed largely by the char-
acter of the accommodations afforded. The vital importance of this
shortage of space will be appreciated when it is stated that the in-

42
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 43

crease of art works by means of gifts and bequests to the Institu-
tion for the 10 years since appropriate exhibition space became
available in the new Natural History Building, ending June 30, 1921,

~—and aside from the rich accessions of the Freer gift, has averaged
in estimated money value upward of $500,000 per year. The year
just closed has fallen far short of that valuation, not exceeding
$10,000, a result due in part, at least, to a knowledge of the real con-
ditions on the part of such owners of collections as have reached the
stage where the future of their accumulations has become a matter
of great concern.

The urgent need of a gallery building is thus strongly emphasized,
for it is apparent that should 10 years elapse before a building for
this purpose is erected, the loss due to delay will amount to several
times the cost of a building. Another consideration of great im-
portance is that the National Gallery is not limited in scope to paint-
ing and sculpture, but has confined its activities mainly to this nar-
row field because no space is available for assembling and displaying
the full range of art products. It is thus most important that Amer-
icans should begin to realize, as have all other civilized nations, the
great importance, the inestimable value, of art as an agency in the
advancement to higher accomplishment in each and every branch of
activity in which taste is an essential feature. We are the only civil-
ized nation that has not risen to a realization of the real value of art
and of the important functions of a National Gallery and that has
not, save in the limited appropriations granted in 1921 and 1922 to
the gallery fostered by the Smithsonian Institution, recognized art
save as the handmaid of history or as an essential of architectural
embellishment or landscape gardening. No important art work has,
for art’s sake pure and simple, ever been purchased with the approval
of the United States Government. The Nation has received as gifts
and bequests, art works amounting to more than ten millions in
money value, and has expended on their acquirement and care possi-
bly one two-hundredth part of that amount. The American people
should at once arise to a realization of the fact that unless gallery
space is provided for the accommodation of prospective additions,
this inflow of art works must practically cease. This would be a
national misfortune and a disaster to the Capital of the Nation.

Robert F. Daly, New York City, was a drummer boy before he was
13 and had seen 17 battles. He endeared himself to his regiment, the
First Duryée Zouaves, especially at Gaines Mills, where he carried
water to the men fighting, from a spring more than a mile to the
rear. On the 7-day retreat to the ships the men carried the boy on
their shoulders. When the regiment returned to New York, the boy’s
father discovered him in line, snatched him from the march, and sent
him back to school.

9. The Signal. After the Battle of Big Bethel. John Tregaskis, Brooklyn,
N. Y., Fifth New York Volunteer Infantry, Duryée Zouaves.

After the Battle of Big Bethel the Union forces were marching by
parallel roads in pursuit of the enemy. During the night at the cross-
roads they fired at each other. To avoid a repetition of the error
they used the white of their turbans around their arm as a signal.

10. The First Sharps Rifle. Homer D. Jennings, St. Cloud, Fla.

The Sharps rifle was used for the first time before Gaines Mills, Va.
It was a repeating rifle and was used by the Fifth New York Volunteer
Infantry, Duryée Zouaves. There were just enough of the rifles to arm
the end men of companies, but the effect upon the opposing forces was
bewildering and disastrous. General Sykes was in command.

11. Adelaide Smith. One of the first Army nurses.

She volunteered at Brooklyn, was with Grant’s army through the

Peninsular campaign, especially during the last years of the Civil War.

THE NATIONAL PORTRAIT COLLECTION.

As announced in last year’s report, a number of influential citizens
desiring to preserve some pictorial record of the World War, organ-
ized a National Portrait Committee and arranged with a number
of our leading portrait painters to paint portraits of certain distin-
guished leaders of America and other allied nations in the war with
Germany. The members of the committee as organized are: Hon,
48 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

Henry White (chairman), Herbert L. Pratt (secretary and treas-
urer), Mrs. W. H. Crocker, Robert W. de Forest, Abram Garfield,
Mrs. E. H. Harriman, Arthur W. Meeker, J. Pierpont Morgan,
Charles P. Taft, Charles D. Walcott, and Henry Frick (since de-
ceased ).

Under this arrangement 20 portraits were painted and assembled
in the National Gallery during the month of May, 1921. Later these
were turned over to the American Federation of Arts for purposes of
public exhibition, and at the close of the year they had been shown in
the following cities: Princeton, N. J.; New Haven, Conn.; Boston,
Mass.; Rochester, N. Y.; Cleveland, Ohio; Williamstown, Mass.;
Amherst, Mass.; Buffalo, N. Y.; Cincinnati, Ohio; Indianapolis,
Ind.; Pittsburgh, Pa.; Detroit, Mich.; Youngstown, Ohio; and Mem-
phis, Tenn.

The portrait of Herbert Clark Hoover, by Edmund C. Tarbell, has
since been added to the number.

THE McFADDEN COLLECTION.

At the close of the year preliminary steps had been taken toward
the acceptance by the gallery of the loan of the McFadden collection
of British masterpieces, comprising 44 notable examples of the work
of Richard Parkes Bonington; John Constable, R. A.; Davis Cox;
John Crome; Thomas Gainsborough, R. A.; George Henry Harlow;
William Hogarth; John Hoppner, R. A.; Sir Thomas Lawrence, P.
R. A.; John Linnell, sr.; George Morland; Sir Henry Raeburn, R. A.;
Sir Joshua Reynolds, P. R. A.; George Romney; James Stark;
George Stubbs, R. A.; Sir John Watson Gordon, R. A.; J. M. W.
Turner, R. A.; and Richard Wilson, R. A. ‘These paintings were ac-
quired by John H. McFadden, Esq., of Philadelphia, Pa., recently
deceased, during his lifetime, and by his will left in trust to the city
of Philadelphia and to be intrusted to its custodianship when the
Municipal Museum now in course of construction is completed. Not-
withstanding the fact that there is much shortage of storage space in
the halls occupied by the national collections, the acceptance of this
rich collection for a limited period is regarded with much favor.

DISTRIBUTIONS.

Loans have been withdrawn by owners as follows: Portrait of
Arthur Spicer, and portrait of Mary Brockerbrough Spicer, his wife,
by Sir Peter Lely, lent by Miss Lucy Stuart Fitzhugh, were with-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

Educator, by Sarony; Hon. Edward Everett, by Asher Brown Du-
rand; Mrs. Edward Everett, by Gambardella; and Charlotte Brooks

Trenchard, withdrawn by the artist. Seven paintings: Portrait of
Mr. Levi Woodbury, of New Hampshire; Portrait of Mrs. Levi Wood-
bury, of New Hampshire; Portrait of an Old Gentleman, and St.
Dominic and the Christ Child, artists not given ; Landscape, attributed
to Berghem; Parrot and Fruit, and Flowers, attributed to Zuccarelli ;
from the collection lent by the Duchess de Arcos (Virginia Wood-
bury Lowery Brunetti), withdrawn by Mr. Woodbury Blair, attor-
ney in fact for the duchess. Four paintings from the loan collection
of the American Federation of Arts were distributed for the federa-
tion as follows: Ducks on the Bank, by Franz Grassel, sent to E. O.
Summer at Brooklyn, N. Y.; Memory of the Tyrol, by J. P. Jung-
hanns, and The Garden, by Max Clarenbach, to the Art Institute of
Chicago, Chicago, Ill.; and Portrait of Mrs. Penelope Wheeler, by
George Sauter, to Messrs Budworth & Sons, New York City.

Caresse Enfantine, a painting by Mary Cassatt, belonging to the
Evans collection, the property of the gallery, was lent to the American
Federation of Arts to be included in an exhibition of pictures of
children under the auspices of the federation, to be shown in six
southern cities: Louisville, Ky.; Roanoke, Va.; Savannah, Ga.;
Charleston, S. C.; Richmond and Norfolk, Va. The work elicited
much favorable comment, and was returned to its place in the gallery
at the close of the exhibition.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 51
ILLUSTRATED LECTURE ON THE GALLERY.

As a means of promoting the development of the gallery by mak-
ing its existence and collections known to the people, a lecture has
been prepared by the director, the step being due largely to the
urgent request of Mrs. Summers, wife of the Hon. J. W. Summers,
Representative in Congress from Washington State, who has pre-
sented it a number of times in his home State. A brief introduction
is followed by the presentation of 75 slides, mostly in color, repre-
senting the Smithsonian buildings and their surroundings and the
more noteworthy works of painting and sculpture preserved in the
gallery, with brief biographies of the artists. The lecture is to be
placed at the disposal of such persons throughout the country as may
desire to present it.

THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART COMMISSION,

The National Gallery Commission, organized in accordance with
plans formulated by the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution,
held its first or organizing meeting on June 25, 1921, and its first
annual meeting on December 6 of that year. The proceedings of
the organizing meeting are outlined in the annual report for that
year, and the proceedings of the meeting of December 6 may be
here briefly outlined.

The meeting was held in the Regents’ Room of the Smithsonian
Institution, members present being: Daniel Chester French (chair-
man), Herbert Adams, Edwin H. Blashfield, Joseph H. Gest,
William H. Holmes (secretary ex-officio), John E. Lodge, Frank
Jewett Mather, jr. (vice chairman), Gari Melchers, Charles Moore,
James Parmelee, Herbert L. Pratt, Edward W. Redfield, Charles
D. Walcott (ex-officio).

The report of the executive committee, which met at the Cosmos
Club on the evening of the 5th of December, was submitted and
reports of the 11 subcommittees were received. These commit-
tees are as follows:

. American painting, Edward W. Redfield, chairman.

. Modern European painting, Gari Melchers, chairman.

52 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

Consideration was given to the proposed exhibit of early Ameri-
van, paintings and sculptures, to be held in the Louvre, Paris, in the
near future, and the advisability of holding a special loan exhibit
of American portraits in the National Gallery in Washington
received attention.

The feasibility of arranging in Washington a plan for the further
development of the art interests, corresponding with that existing
between the Louvre and the Luxemburg Galleries, Paris, was con-
sidered and steps were taken to determine the attitude of other gal-
leries with respect to the suggestion.

The urgent need of a National Gallery building to accommodate
the collections now occupying the very limited space allowed them
in the Natural History Museum, and for future accessions, was con-
sidered, and a resolution enumerating at some length the unfortu-
nate conditions existing and appealing to Congress for the limited
fund required for the preparation of plans for a building was
adopted.

The very serious problems of the acceptance and rejection of prof-
fered works of art of all classes was discussed at length, and at the
close of the meeting the advisory committee on acceptance of works
took necessary action with regard to such offerings for the year as
awaited consideration.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 3.
REPORT ON THE FREER GALLERY OF ART.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the second annual report on the
Freer Gallery of Art for the year ending June 30, 1922.

THE COLLECTION.

Work carried on during the year includes the classification and
cataloguing of Chinese, Japanese, and Tibetan paintings, Chinese
tapestries, and Chinese and Japanese pottery; the preliminary classi-
fication of Korean pottery and Chinese and Japanese stone sculp-
tures and jades; and the cataloguing of American paintings, draw-
ings, and prints (inclusive of both etchings and lithographs). Im-
portant progress has been made also in the indispensable preservation
work on oil paintings.

BUILDING AND INSTALLATION.

Owing to a temporary lack of applicable funds, work on the build-
ing and installation was discontinued in July and was not resumed
until December. The work accomplished, however, includes the con-
tinuation—and in some instances the completion—of undertakings
mentioned in the first annual report: The dais in gallery 18 has been
rebuilt and stained, the walls of 15 galleries and 2 corridors have been
recolored, all of the storage bags and 27 of the storage boxes for
Japanese screens have been completed, the Chinese and Japanese
panel storage has been finished and the panels themselves placed in
their permanent storage racks. The more important items of the
new work undertaken are as follows: The dais in gallery 8 has been
removed, terrazzo floor has been laid in the areas thus exposed, and
the walls have been covered with canvas. The two large Chinese
stone slabs purchased during the previous fiscal year were set in the
wall of gallery 9 and repaired, practically all of the Whistler oil
painting frames have been repaired and regilded, and 16 storage
racks for oil paintings have been constructed. The installation of
fly screens has been effected, as has also the correction of defective
doors and the reenforcing of the meeting rails of the double-hung
windows throughout the basement floor. Bronze light standards
have been erected outside of the north and south entrances, the

offices have been carpeted and furnished, oiling of the gallery floors
has been begun, electric meters have been installed, cheesecloth
screens have been provided for the ventilators in all the storage
rooms, and necessary drains have been set in the lower floor at
various places.

APPENDIX 4,
REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

Str: In response to your request I have the honor to submit the
following report on the field researches, office work, and other
operations of the Bureau of American Ethnology during the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1922, conducted in accordance with the act of
Congress approved March 4, 1921. The act referred to contains
the following item:

American ethnology: For continuing ethnological researches among the
American Indians and the natives of Hawaii, including the excavation and
preservation of archeologic remains, under the direction of the Smithsonian
Institution, including the necessary employees and the purchase of necessary
books and periodicals, $46,000.

The Indians of the United States are undergoing cultural changes
which will in a short time so modify their material culture that little
will be left in that line for the ethnologist to study. It is impera-
tive that the bureau exert itself in every way to record the material
culture and cult objects before the final change occurs. The objects
illustrating this culture are now mainly preserved as heirlooms in
ceremonies, and it is particularly desirable that these be described
and their meanings interpreted before they pass out of use com-
pletely.

In 1904 the bureau inaugurated at Casa Grande a method of
archeological work which has now been adopted by most of the
institutions working in the southwestern part of the United States.
Previous to this time archeologists rarely paid attention to the preser-
vation of walls of ruins, but sacrificed these in their zeal to make
as large collections of artifacts as possible.

The bureau method of preserving the buildings for future students
has now been adopted by other institutions, and work of this nature is
being carried on at Pueblo Bonito, Chaco Canyon, by the National
Geographic Society; at Chettro Kettle, in the same canyon, by the
School of American Research, Santa Fe, N. Mex.; at Pecos, N. Mex,
by the Phillips Academy, Andover, Mass.; and at Aztec by the Ameri-
can Museum of Natural History of New York. This method of arch-
eological work has created a great interest in archeological problems,
as indicated by the increased number of visitors to these ruins, and

55
56 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

has a great practical value as an asset to the communities in which
these ruins are situated. It is the intention of the chief of the bureau
to keep abreast of the other institutions in this regard.

In the past year the bureau has entered upon two new lines of work
which it is believed will not only increase its scientific output by
intensive research but also appeal strongly to the popular interest and
to the diffusion of knowledge already acquired. For many years it
has not been found practical to continue work on the Hawaiian
Islands, which is mentioned as one of the important items of ethno-
logical research in the above act of Congress. A meeting of the
Pan Pacific Convention in Honolulu shows an increased interest in
the study of the Polynesian islanders and their relation to the ques-
tion of the peopling of America from the South Seas. Mr. Gerard
Fowke, a collaborator of the bureau, was commissioned to attend this
convention in the interest of the Smithsonian Institution, and he was
instructed to gather whatever information he could in relation to the
archeology of the people, if any, that preceded the Hawaiian race of
the present day. Although his results were negative, it is gratifying
that the bureau took part in this convention,’as it opened up several
lines of work in other islands which it may later be advantageous to
follow. The Sandwich Islands lie practically on the periphery of
the sphere of influence of the Polynesian culture, and local investi-
gators have the Hawaiians well in hand. There is considerable to do
in mapping the distribution of temples and ancient buildings, but this
work is being rapidly done by local archeologists. It is desirable,
however, that the bureau take up archeological work in Samoa or
some island nearer the center of distribution of the race which has
occupied almost all the land in the Pacific Ocean. The imperfect
facilities for transportation from one island to another and the loss
of time in transit is a serious handicap in this work.

A second line of research which promises even more to the scientific
investigator and the tourist is a study of the material culture, espe-
cially the architecture, of the houses of the aborigines of Alaska. In
the growth of the canning industry the Indians who formerly inhab-
ited southern Alaska have been drawn away from their aboriginal
villages, leaving them deserted and their totem poles and buildings
to the mercy of fire and decay. The monuments are rapidly going to
destruction, and it is very desirable that steps be immediately taken to
preserve these buildings or a typical example of them before they are
utterly destroyed.

One of these settlements, Kasaan, has already been made a national
monument. Steps should be taken to preserve others.

Dr. T. T. Waterman was sent by the bureau to investigate the whole
question—primarily to secure whatever vanishing ethnological data
is still extant. He was instructed to gather information on the sym-
ja REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

bolism of the totem poles, the character of the houses, distribution
of clans, and whatever scientific data can be obtained from those still
living who once inhabited these villages. This line of investigation
appeals very strongly to the chief from his knowledge of the growth
in interest of the Mesa Verde National Park. In 1908, when he began
work on this park, only 25 tourists visited the Mesa Verde; this year,
1922, the number will reach 4,500. This shows a great growth of
interest in the work being done there; and, as many tourists now seek
Alaska in their summer vacation, one of these villages repaired would
attract many visitors. It is proposed to continue this work next
summer with an enlarged appropriation.

The work of the bureau in other lines has gone on with customary
vigor. The chief has repeatedly emphasized the necessity of rescu-
ing the linguistic and sociological data of those Indian stocks that
ate rapidly disappearing. It would be culpable if any of these
languages should vanish completely without some record. Interest
in the aborigines of this continent has greatly increased in the last
years, especially on account of the stimulus of the movement called
“See America First.”

In addition to his purely administrative duties, considerable time
has been devoted by the chief to researches in the field. This work
was archeological in nature and a continuation of that of previous
years, and was carried on in cooperation with the National Park
Service of the Department of the Interior.

Two months were spent in the neighborhood of Far View House,
the first pueblo discovered on the Mesa Verde National Park, six
years ago. In the course of the work this fine ruin was thoroughly
repaired and put in such condition that it will now resist the wear
of the elements for several years. Ruins once repaired must be
watched with care. On an average between 3,000 and 4,000 visitors,
mainly tourists, visit the Mesa Verde National Park and examine
the excavated ruins. Fifteen thousand visitors have already passed
through Spruce-tree House and Cliff Palace, and the wear on the soft
rock of which the ruins are made is beginning to show. Unless
constant vigilance is exercised the walls will fall within a short
time. Any deterioration ought to be repaired annually. Tourists
are not now permitted to visit any of the ruins on this park without
@ guide, a regulation that has been strictly enforced during the past
year.

Field work in May and June was devoted to excavating a ruin
called Pipe Shrine House, situated to the south of Far View House.
This was apparently a communal building, or one not inhabited,
which was used by the people of the pueblo for sacred ceremonies.
It would appear that Pipe Shrine House, so called, bears the same
relationship to Far View House that the Lower House of the Yucca
58 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

National Monument does to the Upper. The great kiva at Aztec,
in New Mexico, lately excavated, bears a somewhat similar rela-
tionship to the main ruin, and there are several of the Chaco Canyon
ruins where similar conditions prevail.

The site of Pipe Shrine House when work began was a low mound
covered with sagebrush with a saucerlike depression in the center,
not unlike several others in the immediate vicinity of Far View
House. The removal of vegetation and débris and an excavation of
the rooms revealed a rectangular building 70 by 60 feet, with walls
averaging one story high. It had indications of a lofty tower in
the middle of the western side, which must have imparted to the
building somewhat the appearance of a church steeple or the minaret
of a mosque. The large room was situated in the center of the
ruin, its floor being about 20 feet below that of.the other rooms.
This subterranean room is a kiva, but it differs from others of like
type on the park in that it has no fireplace in the center of the
floor, no ventilator or deflector, and has eight mural pilasters in-
stead of six to support the roof. The fallen walls within showed
indications of a great conflagration, the stones and adobe being
turned red and the walls turned bright red by the great heat. On
the floor of the kiva was an inclosure set off by a semicircular wall
where the action of fire was particularly evident. In the inclosure
were found many votive offerings, the most numerous of which
were a dozen clay tobacco pipes of various shapes and sizes, one
or two decorated on their exteriors. These pipes, which are the
first ever found on the Mesa Verde, evidently had been smoked
by the priests and then thrown into the shrine. Besides the
pipes the shrine also contained several fine stone knives, small
decorated clay platters, various fetishes, and other objects. Pipe
Shrine House was entered on the south by two doorways, midway
setween which a large pictograph of a coiled serpent was incised on
a large stone set in the wall. To the south of the building there was
a plaza surrounded by a retaining wall and directly opposite one of
the entrances there are aboriginal steps which lead to a rectangular
shrine 4 feet in size, in which were found a number of water-
worn stones surrounding a large stone image of the mountain lion.
The contents of this shrine were replaced, the mountain lion left
in his original position, and the inclosure covered with a netting
to prevent the possible removing of the objects from their places.
Other shrines and several stone idols of considerable size were
found in the neighborhood. The idols found at Pipe Shrine House
represent the snake, mountain lion, mountain sheep, and bird—an
important discovery, as previously only one stone animal idol had
been found at the Mesa Verde Park.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 59

One of the most instructive experiences of the archeologist is to
see a skeleton centuries old as it lies in the grave. One of the ancient
people of Pipe Shrine House was left in a prepared chamber for
tourists to inspect.

The cemetery lies on the southeast corner of this ruin, and in it
were found several human burials from one of which a good skeleton
was chosen to illustrate the manner of burial and the mortuary
offerings. This skeleton was not removed from the grave but was
surrounded by a stone wall forming a room, rectangular in shape,
protected by a grating and a waterproof roof. Visitors may now
see one of the skeletons of the race of cliff dwellers as he was placed
in his grave more than 500 years ago; not a single bone has been
moved from position. This is the first time in North American
archeology that an effort has been made to protect an Indian skeleton
in situ, and the success of the method is self-evident, judging from
the comments of visitors.

The pipes found in the shrine of the kiva have suggested “ Pipe
Shrine House” as a name for the building. It seems to have been
given up to the rites and ceremonies of the inhabitants of the neigh-
boring Far View House.

The second ruin excavated at Mesa Verde was formerly the habi-
tation of one clan or of one social unit composed of relatives on the
mother’s side, on which account this ruin was given the name “ One
Clan House.” It is situated about one-eighth of a mile south of
Pipe Shrine House and consists of a circular subterranean room or
kiva of fine masonry surrounded by rooms for sleeping, others for
grinding corn, and still others used as bins for corn or storage
rooms. The kiva was the ceremonial or men’s room.

One of the most instructive ruins excavated in 1922 is a round
tower, 15 feet in diameter and 10 feet high, situated about 300 feet
north of Far View House. In front of this tower were found three
subterranean kivas under the fallen débris, in one of which were con-
structed walls of a square building, indicating secondary occupation,
and erected after the abandonment of the kiva. This tower and
accompanying kivas may be called Far View Tower, and the indica-
tions are that it was used for observations, particularly of the sun on
the horizon at sunrise and sunset, in order to determine the time for
planting and other dates important for an agricultural people. These
towers were probably rooms for the worship of the sun and other sky
gods.

Some distance north of Far View Tower there were discovered
in the cedars a number of large stones arranged vertically in rows
projecting 3 feet above the surface of the ground. Excavation showed
that these megaliths were walls of buildings of anomalous character,
indicating a new type of architecture on the Mesa Verde. This
60 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

ruin, “ Megalithic House,” was not completely excavated, but all the
others were repaired, the tops of the walls being covered with cement
to prevent future erosion.

An important collection made by the chief in the course of the
summer’s work contains many rare and unique specimens, an account
of which will later be published in a report on the excavations.

During his work at the Mesa Verde the chief gave camp-fire
talks in the special amphitheater constructed for that purpose by the
superintendent of the park. The average attendance on these talks
was about 40 each evening, and at times, as on a visit of a convention
of teachers, there were 150 listeners. He also spent considerable time
daily taking parties over the new work which he was doing in the
neighborhood of Far View House.

Ever since 1917 the chief has been attempting to have the sites
of three clusters of towers in Utah withdrawn from private owner-
ship and made into a national monument, to be called Hovenweep
National Monument. Various circumstances have made it impos-
sible to bring this about. During the past summer, however, Mr.
Hatze, a Land Office surveyor, determined the metes and bounds
of these three clusters and later Doctor Fewkes visited them in order
to determine their present condition. He found that a settler had
filed claims on the neighboring land, the adjoining one-quarter mile
section, and erected his cabin. Some of the cabins in the neighbor-
hood have stones remarkably like those of the towers; in other words,
the necessity for immediate action, if these towers are to be pre-
served for posterity, is apparent, and the land on which they are
situated should be withdrawn from settlement and the buildings put
under the care of proper authorities. The three groups are known
as the Square Tower, the Ruin Canyon group; the Holly and Keeley
Towers; and the large ruin at the head of the Cajon Mesa called
Cool Spring House, on account of the fine water which is found in
the cave back of the cliff house.

During the fiscal year Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, was en-
gaged in extracting the words from his Hitchiti texts and adding
them to his dictionary on cards of the Hitchiti language, and in pre-
paring a grammatical sketch of 75 pages based on this material and
that collected by Dr. A. S. Gatschet.

Much time was devoted to transferring words to cards from his
Alabama texts, and from material in Alabama secured through na-
tive informants, into an Alabama-English dictionary. The first 25
pages of a grammatical sketch of this language have also been com-
pleted.

A comparison has been made between the Natchez language on the
one hand and Koasati and Hitchiti on the other, in order to establish
the position of Natchez in the Muskhogean linguistic stock. This
ous

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 61

has not yet been set down in full, but all of the essential points have
been typewritten on cards.

A paper of 44 pages has been prepared in elaboration of some
recent discoveries regarding the Siouan peoples, discoveries which
have an especial bearing on the relationship of the various Siouan
groups to one another.

_ A small amount of work has been done in continuance of Doctor
Swanton’s investigations into the economic basis of American Indian
life, particularly a study of aboriginal trails and trade routes.

The work of collecting stories dealing with the old clan divisions
of the Chickasaw Indians, undertaken by a Chickasaw at Doctor
Swanton’s suggestion, has met with gratifying success, 10 or 12 such
stories having already been sent in.

During the fiscal year Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, was engaged
entirely in office work.

In his report for the fiscal year 1921 it was stated that a number’
of Chippewa and Ottawa texts had been obtained in 1900 from
Mr. John Miscogeon, an Ottawa mixed blood, then in Washington,
D. C., and that Mr. George Gabaoosa, a mixed-blood Chippewa, had
been employed to amend and to supply the Chippewa versions of
these texts. He also amplified the texts by substantial additions.
This material covers 125 pages. Mr. Gabaoosa’s fixed habit of writing
his native language by means of the alphabet employed by the mis-
slonaries made it needful that these texts thus written be translated
into the alphabet devised by Maj. J. W. Powell, founder of the Bureau
of American Ethnology, for recording native Indian languages.
This work of transliteration is one of considerable difficulty, because
the aid of a native Chippewa speaker is not available in the office and
Mr. Hewitt does not speak Chippewa.

In addition, Mr. Hewitt continued work in preparing the Musk-
hogean material detailed in his last report.

Mr. Hewitt also continued his typing of the native Onondaga texts
of the second part of the Iroquoian Cosmology, the first part having
appeared in the twenty-first annual report of the bureau. There are
now 255 pages of text material in final form.

As custodian of manuscripts Mr. Hewitt reports that no new lin-
guistic records were added to the material permanently in his charge.
Collaborators and others make temporary deposits of manuscripts
upon which work is being done, and these are not catalogued as of
permanent deposit.

Mr, Hewitt spent much time and study in the preparation of data
for official replies to correspondents of the bureau and of the Indian
Office also, the latter by reference only. The scope of the inquiries
covers almost the entire range of human interest, often quite outside
of the specific researches properly coming within the activities of the
62 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

Bureau of American Ethnology, but many are only requests for the
derivation of some alleged native Indian place or proper name, often
greatly Anglicized and mutilated. Some of these inquiries require
more than a day’s work to answer, as it is sometimes necessary to visit
the Congressional Library in search of data. Data for more than
75 such inquiries were prepared.

Immediately following the death of the late Mr. James Mooney,
Mr. Hewitt assisted Mrs. Mooney in assorting and separating the
personal letters and papers of Mr, Mooney, some in advanced stages
of preparation (the accumulation of more than 80 years’ activity in
an official capacity), from those which by their nature are official
documents, and correspondence and photographs. More than a week
was devoted to this work.

Before placing this material in the new store-room a rough classi-
fication was made of it. Five main groups were made, correspond-
-ing roughly with the five chief papers which Mr. Mooney had under
way for a number of years before his demise, namely, (a) A Study of
the Peyote and Its Accompanying Religious Cult; (6) A Monograph
on the Population of the Indian Tribes When First Known; (¢c) A
Paper on Cherokee Medical Formulas Recorded in the Sequoya
Alphabet by Native Priests; (d) Kiowa Heraldry; and (e) A Study
of the Cheyenne and Arapaho Shields. Owing to the peculiar chi-
rography of Mr. Mooney and his excessive use of abbreviations pecu-
lar to himself, this task proved to be a most tedious and difficult one.

Mr. Hewitt, who represents the Smithsonian institution on the
United States Geographic Board, attended all its regular meetings
except one and all the special meetings of the board.

Mr. Francis La Flesche, ethnologist, continued during the fiscal
year the task of assembling his notes for the second volume of his
work on The Osage Tribe. The manuscript for the second volume,
which embraces two versions of an ancient Osage ritual entitled,
“No®-zhi®-zho® Wa-tho",’ Songs of the Rite of Vigil, was com-
pleted and turned in to the bureau on February 25, 1922, where it
awaits publication.

The first version of this ritual, which is counted as next in im-
portance to the Hearing of the Sayings of the Ancient Men, pub-
lished in the thirty-sixth annual report of the bureau, was given by
Wa-xthi-zhi of the Puma gens of the Osage. This man had learned
the ritual from his father, Wa-thi-ts’aga-zhi, who is said to have
been one of the best informed No*’-ho®-zhi®-ga in the tribal rites.
With some difficulty Mr. Ia Flesche managed to persuade Sho”’-ge-
mo?-i", of the Peacemaker gens, a more conservative man than Wa-
xthi-zhi, to give the second version, which belongs to his gens. As
this ritual pertains to war, old Sho®’-ge-mo”-i" desired it to be clearly
stil

understood that his gens performed the ceremonies of the ritual as
a mere matter of form rather than as an actual owner of the rite.
The office of his gens, he explained, was one that was instituted for
the conservation of life and the maintenance of peace within the
tribe and with other tribes not related to the Osage.

On the completion of the manuscript for the second volume, Mr.
La Flesche began the task of assembling his notes for the third
volume, which will embrace two tribal rituals, the first of which is
entitled “ Wa-x6-be A-wa-tho",” Songs Relating to the Wa-xé-be.
The Wa-x6-be is the sacred hawk, the symbol of the valor of the
Osage warrior. The second ritual is entitled “Ca Tha-dse Ga-xe,”
literally, The Making of the Rush, but meaning the Making of the
Woven Rush Shrine for the Wa-x6-be.

On July 1, 1921, Dr. Truman Michelson, ethnologist, was at Tama,
Towa, continuing his work among the Fox Indians of that State.
He completed gathering data on Fox mortuary customs and beliefs
and restored texts appertaining to these and worked out a vocabu-
lary as far as possible in the field. On the completion of this he re-
stored phonetically a text previously collected on the Fox society
known as “Those who worship the little spotted buffalo.” He also
worked out, as far as practical, the vocabulary to this text. At the
close of August he returned to Washington and elaborated the ma-
terial collected in the field. During the fiscal year Dr. Michelson
submitted two manuscripts for publication, namely, “ Notes on Fox
mortuary customs and beliefs” and “ Notes on the Fox society known
as ‘'Those who worship the little spotted buffalo.’ ”

On May 25 Doctor Michelson left for the West to conduct
researches among the Algonquian Indians of Iowa, Kansas, and
Oklahoma. He stopped at Columbus, Ohio, to consult with Prof.
L. Bloomfield. As a result of this conference it became apparent
that Menomini is very clearly more closely related to Cree than to
any other Algonquian language. He found the work at Shawnee,
Okla., very difficult and expensive, owing to the fact that the Algon-
quian Indians of that State are scattered and distances are very
great. However, during his short stay he secured sufficient informa-
tion to show definitely that not only the Sauk but also the Kickapoo
share many mortuary customs and beliefs with the Fox of Iowa. He
thinks that these correspondences are too detailed and too numerous
to be of independent origin and must be due to dissemination. This
point regarding the Sauk and Fox is not novel, but it is regarding
the Kickapoo. There are, however, some differences in the mortuary
customs of all neighboring tribes. This last fact is not so well known.
A detailed study of all three neighboring tribes, Siouan as well as
Algonquian, on these matters alone can clear up the history of the

64 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

borrowings. He expects to obtain data on these points regarding the
Shawnee and Potawatomi also.

The beginning of the fiscal year found Mr. J. P. Harrington,
ethnologist, engaged in completing his bulletin on the Kiowa lan-
guage, in several respects one of the most remarkable of the Amer-
ican Indian tongues. Aside from the phonetic system, with its un-
usual frequency of long vowels and diphthongs, we may point to
the noun, several declensions of which form the singular by adding
the same suflixes which other declensions use for forming the plural.
These singulars of plural form are doubtless conceived as collective,
for a personal pronoun in apposition also has the plural form. Thus
pronominal agreement arises many times more complicated than
that in the three-gendered languages of Europe, and is further in-
volved by subjective, objective, and indirective pronouns largely
combining to form a single syllable—a very terse yet involved sys-
tem of speech. A number of Kiowa and Tanoan songs were found
to have the melody following in exaggerated form the intonation of
the spoken language. Thus the song “ agoyopovi navi ha, wimbo
winda ” has the high tones of its words also high pitched in the song.
This has led to the important discovery that certain melodies in in-
toned languages may take their clue from the intonation of the
words. The Kiowa vocabulary secured is quite complete and forms
an interesting contribution to the study of the place names, animal
names, and plant names adopted by a tribe when it leaves its old
home and moves to a new region. Mr. Harrington proceeded at the
close of July to California to continue his studies of the Indians of
the Chumashan area of that State. This expedition proved fruitful
in results beyond all expectation. Special emphasis was laid on the
place names, material culture, and language. More than 300 photo-
graphs of Indian places and historic landmarks were secured, to-
gether with a wealth of highly interesting and important data. The
collecting of Indian place names in the Eastern States was neglected
until too late, so that we have only a few names in distorted spelling
and of uncertain etymology. It is still possible to obtain full data
in many parts of the West, and there is scarcely any work which the
Dureau can undertake which is more important or urgent, either in
popular interest or as a help to the future ethnologist, historian, or
archeologist.

Linguistic study is peculiarly important in this area, since it resur-
rects past culture and records perishing material for comparison with
remote languages. Thirty new Venturefo songs were obtained from
one singer, all with native words. The technique of the split-stick
accompaniment and the dance steps were faithfully studied and the
words were exhaustively compared with the corresponding prose
forms.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 65

Mr. Harrington’s opinion was confirmed that the southern Cal-
ifornia culture has many curious points of resemblance with that of
the Southwest. Even the Pueblo plumed prayer stick, with sand
paintings and the ceremonial use of meal and seeds, have been found
also among the Californians.

Twice during the fiscal year Mr. Harrington was temporarily
transferred to the Department of the Interior for special archive
work. At the close of the fiscal year he returned to Washington.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES.

During the past fiscal year Miss Densmore has extended her
study of Indian music by recording songs among the Yuma, Cocopa,
and Yaqui tribes, making a total of nine tribes among whom this
work has been done. Mohave songs were obtained from two mem-
bers of that tribe living on the Yuma Reservation, and one Maya
song was recorded in the Yaqui village. Four manuscripts on In-
dian music were submitted, the titles being “Songs Concerning
Elder Brother and His People, and Other Papago Songs,” “'The
Rain Ceremony of the Papago,” “A Cocopa Legend and its Songs,”
and “ Deer Dance Songs of the Yuma, Yaqui, and Maya Indians.”
In addition to her work on Indian music Miss Densmore has com-
pleted for publication two books on Chippewa culture with the
titles “ Uses of Plants by the Chippewa,” and “ Chippewa Arts and
Customs.” The former book contains descriptions of the uses of
168 plants in medicine, food, dye, charms, and general utility, the
section on medicine being in tabulated form and showing the uses
of the plant by other tribes, where such use is recorded, and its
use by the white race, if such occurs. This tabulation shows the
ailments for which a plant was used, the part of the plant utilized,
the manner of its preparation, the dosage, and, in some instances,
the time before an improvement in the condition of the patient was
expected. The latter book contains sections on Chippewa nouns
and their structure, on the various industries by which the tribe
maintained itself, and on the care and training of little children.
New material was submitted in the form of two manuscripts, Cer-
tain Customs of the Chippewa in Ontario, Canada, and Chippewa
Nouns and Their Structure, these titles corresponding to the prin-
cipal subjects under consideration. Three brief trips in Minnesota
and Wisconsin were made for this work. Miss Densmore also read
the page proof of her book on Northern Ute Music.

In February, 1922, Miss Densmore went to Yuma, Ariz., where
she remained six weeks. During that time she made a brief trip
to a Cocopa settlement located near the Colorado River and about
6 miles from the Mexican boundary. The older Cocopa living
66 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

at this point came from Mexico about 18 years ago and neither
they nor their children had a status in the United States. At this
time, however, they were enrolled under the Yuma Agency, Miss
Densmore assisting in the enrollment by writing their Cocopa names
in simple phonetic spelling. Forty Cocopa songs were recorded,
comprising songs of two representative dances and of a cremation
legend. For this work it was necessary to employ two interpreters.

It is the custom of both Cocopa and Yuma to cremate their dead,
and Miss Densmore witnessed a Yuma cremation soon after her arri-
val. ‘The dead man had been a leading singer at cremations and the
ceremony was given with the elaborateness which would be accorded
a chief. The songs were very old and are seldom used at the pres-
ent time. Miss Densmore obtained phonographic records of these
songs, as well as of the Kurok or Memorial ceremony which is held
each summer for the more important persons who have died during
the year. Images of the deceased persons are carried in the dances
of the Kurok and publicly burned. The history of these ceremonies,
with the songs, was obtained from the oldest man who is an au-
thority on the subject. It is the belief of these people that the spirit
departs from the body in the flame of the cremation.

A new musical form was found among the Yuma and Cocopa, con-
sisting of a “song cycle” which required an entire night for its
rendition and is commonly called a “story.” Each of these stories
has its designated accompaniment. Among the Yuma the accom-
‘ panying instruments are a gourd rattle and an inverted basket struck
with a bundle of arrow-weed, a willow stick, or the palm of the hand.
Sometimes two bundles of arrow-weed or two willow sticks are used,
being held in the same hand. Specimens of these instruments were
obtained, also a bamboo fiute and two bamboo flageolets. The music
of the latter was phonographically recorded. The Yuma songs in-
cluded those of the treatment of the sick, those of games, and three
interesting lullabies.

The work among the Yaqui was conducted at Guadalupe village,
near Tempe, Ariz. The older Yaqui in this village were born in
Mexico. These Indians have received no favors from the United
States Government and support themselves by manual labor. They
seem happy and contented in their little desert village. Miss Dens-
more witnessed their deer dance and later recorded the songs from
one of the leading singers, a native of Mexico. The occasion of the
dance was the celebration of Easter eve. The songs were accom-
panied by playing upon four half gourds. The Yaqui have two dis-
tinct forms of music, one which appears to be entirely native and the
other showing a Mexican or Spanish influence.

A large proportion of the songs transcribed and heard during the
past year were accompanied by a gourd rattle, and are of unusual
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 67

musical value, both in pleasing melody and rhythmic interest. This
suggests an inquiry as to whether the songs accompanied by the rattle
are generally more musical than those accompanied by the drum.
It is interesting to note that the songs of the Yuma and Cocopa
resemble each other but differ entirely from the songs of the Papago
who live adjoining them. The songs of the Yaqui, so far as observed,
differ from both these tribes except in the frequent use of rests. The
rhythm of the rattle in Yuma and Cocopa performances is more
elaborate and contains more frequent changes than that of the ac-
companying instrument in any tribe thus far studied. A correspond-
ence between the words of the song and the progressions of the
melody is particularly evident in these songs.

Early in March, 1922, Dr. T. T. Waterman, ethnologist, proceeded
to Alaska, under temporary appointment in the bureau, with instruc-
tions from the chief to scrutinize certain native towns in southeastern
Alaska. His purpose was to ascertain how many totemic monuments
exist there, and to get information concerning the carvings. The
place of special interest was a former settlement of Alaskan Haida,
known as Kasaan. It was possible during the three months that
Doctor Waterman spent in Alaska to make a rapid survey not only
of Kasaan but of the towns known as Village Island, Tongass, Cape
Fox, Klinkwan, Howkan, Sukwan, Klawak, and Tuxekan. Some ex-
tremely interesting monuments, including many tall and imposing
totem poles, were examined and photographed. Charts or sketch
maps were brought back from the field, which show the number of
monuments still standing in each town and their state of preserva-
tion. The observer was fairly successful in obtaining from the In-
dians an account of the meaning of the carvings on the poles, which
have never been adequately described. In many cases the carvings
refer to mythical tales, which are often of a very interesting type.

In addition to the work on the totemic monuments, the observer
recorded a relatively complete list of the native place names in the
southeastern part of Alaska. Many hundreds of these names were
entered on the map of the region, and translations and explanations
were obtained from the Indians. The work was fairly complete for
the area covered.

Under further instructions from the chief, Doctor Waterman ex-
amined the coast line of the part of Alaska which he visited, with a
view to discovering sites where archeological excavations might
possibly be conducted. The results of this work were largely nega-
tive. Asa matter of fact only one site was found where there seemed
to be archeological remains. This hasty survey seemed to indicate
that archeological remains in this part of Alaska are extremely
scanty.
68 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

Returning to the bureau on June 15, Doctor Waterman began the
preparation of a report on the Alaskan monuments.

In the fall of 1921, Mr. W. E. Myer investigated sites in South
Dakota and western Missouri, known to have been occupied by the
Omahas and Osages in early historic times, after they had come in
contact with the whites but before they had been changed thereby
to any considerable extent.

Especial attention was paid to any resemblance to the ancient
cultures found in the valleys of the Ohio, Cumberland, and Ten-
nessee Rivers. This line of research was suggested by certain tradi-
tions of both the Omahas and the Osages, and other branches of the
great Siouan linguistic family, that they had at one time lived east
of the Mississippi River, and after many wanderings, stopping here
and there for years, finally reached their present homes in South
Dakota and western Missouri.

Mr. Francis La Flesche reported that the traditions of his people,
the Omahas, were that they had occupied two important villages on
what the Omahas call “ The Big Bend of the Xe,” at some time in the
seventeenth or eighteenth century.

Mr. Myer was enabled to locate these two ancient villages; one,
Split Rock site on the Big Sioux River, at its junction with Split
Rock River; the other where the Rock Island Railroad now crosses
the Big Sioux River, about 10 miles southeast of Sioux Falls. It is
here designated the Rock Island site.

Sometime in the seventeenth century the Omahas and Poncas re-
moved from the Pipestone region in Minnesota and finally, after
some further wanderings, built a fortified town on the Rock Island
site. While living in this fortified place they were attacked and de-
feated by an enemy, most probably the Dakotas, and finally forced
to leave the region. There is a tradition that they buried their dead
from this fight in a mound. This tradition was confirmed by excava-
tions made by Mr. A. G. Risty and Mr. F. W. Pettigrew, who report
finding a considerable amount of human bones. Some glass beads and
small copper bells of white man’s make were also found in one of these
mounds. There is evidence that this site was occupied somewhere
between 1700 and 1725.

After leaving the Rock Island site, the Omahas and Poncas roved
without long permanent settlements for several years, but finally re-
turned to the Xe and built a permanent village at Split Rock at the
junction of the Big Sioux and Split Rock Rivers.

Mr. Myer spent the month of October, 1921, in exploring this Split
Rock site. Many interesting relics of the Omahas were here un-
earthed, which throw new light on the life of these people before they
had been very much changed by contact with the whites.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

The 80 mounds on the ridge between the two rivers mark the site
of that portion of the old town occupied by the Omahas. On a hill
one-half mile to the east was a group of 10 more mounds, occupied
by the Poncas before they split away from the Omahas.

By following the clues furnished by the traditions, three low
mounds were discovered on the tall ridge 14 miles to the west. These
were said to have marked the lookouts for the main village; they
command a view, ranging from 6 to 15 miles, on all sides. The
mounds on the Split Rock site appear to have nearly all been used
for burial.

The exploration of mound No. 1, on the Omaha section of the town,
showed a beautiful little knoll on the edge of the steep, bluff-like bank
of Split Rock River. In its soil the Indians dug a shallow pit, about
12 by 6 feet, and 2 feet deep. Here were placed bones belonging to
five bodies, several of which appeared to have been buried after decay
of the flesh. One body appeared to have been closely flexed before
it was placed in the pit. The position of the skeleton of a horse with
a crushed frontal bone showed that when this body bundle had been
placed in the pit, a large horse, about seven years of age, had been
led to the knoll, and there killed. Then, over all these, a low, round-
topped mound, 60 feet across at the base and 54 feet in height, had
been raised.

Mound No. 2, the largest of the group, was round topped, 110 feet
across at the base, and 10 feet high. A rectangular charnel pit, 12 by
14 feet and 2 feet deep, had been dug in the surface of the soil near
the center of the town. This pit was thoroughly lined or coated with
a white layer about one-eighth inch in thickness, made from calcined
bones. The bottom and sides of the pit were then probably covered
with furs, now indicated by a thin layer of animal matter on the
white coating. Bones representing about 50 human beings had been
laid on the floor of this fur-lined pit.

Traces of the thin fur layer were also found on top of this solid
mass of human bones. Over this fur covering a layer of bark was
placed, and upon this bark earth had been spread to a depth of
from 3 to 6 inches. The earth was then smoothed and pressed down,
and on this surface a white coating, similar to that on the bottom
and sides, had been spread. Only one small, cylindrical copper bead
was found with all this mass of bones, and no object of white man’s
manufacture was found. There is evidence that this portion of the
site was occupied by the Omahas somewhere between 1725 and 1775.

While the Omahas and their kindred, the Poncas, lived together
at the Split Rock site some of the most important events in their
history took place. The united Omahas and Poncas and their old
enemies, the Cheyennes and Arikaras, here made a peace which

70 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

was concluded with great ceremony. At the urgent request of the
Arikara the sacred chant and dance of the calumet was used to ce-
ment this union.

In Vernon and Bates Counties, western Missouri, near the junction
of the Osage and Marmiton Rivers, Mr. Myer found several sites
known to have been occupied by the Osage Indians in early historic
times, shortly after they had come in contact with the whites.

The largest Osage village in Vernon County was situated at Old
Town, on Old Town Creek, about 34 miles south of Pikes village
of the Grand Osage. This site covers about 40 acres and is the best
known of any of the Osage sites. It has yielded a large amount of
iron axes, gun barrels, gunlocks, fragments of brass kettles, glass
beads, and other articles of early white manufacture, as well as
objects of purely aboriginal origin.

The most picturesque Indian site in this Osage region is Halleys
Bluff, on the Osage River, about 14 miles downstream from where
the Marmiton and Marais des Cygnes unite to form the Osage River.
There is evidence showing occupancy of this bluff by Indians long
before the coming of the white man and probably before the coming
of the Osages.

During the month of October, 1921, Mr. David I. Bushnell, jr.,
visited Scott Field, east of Belleville, Ill., for the purpose of getting
airplane pictures of the Cahokia mounds. The commanding officer
of the field, Maj. Frank M. Kennedy, appreciating the interest and
importance of the work, detailed Lieuts. Harold R. Wells and Ashley
C. McKinley, of the Air Service, to make the pictures. They suc-
ceeded in making some very interesting photographs of mounds in
the vicinity of Cahokia, as well as of the great mound itself, but
unfortunately the photographic apparatus at that time available at
Scott Field was not suitable, and although the pictures obtained were
not very clear, nevertheless no better results could have been secured
with the cameras which they were obliged to use. Four of the pic-
tures made by Lieutenants Wells and McKinley were reproduced as
Figures 101, 102, 103, and 104 in Explorations and Field Work of the
Smithsonian Institution in 1921 and should prove of special interest
as the first photographs of American earthworks made from the air.

The article in which the four airplane pictures were used was pre-
pared for the purpose of showing the great importance of the Cahokia
group and of the other related groups to the north, west, and south
of Cahokia. The southern group, although many of the units have
been destroyed, is of special interest. It is situated near the left
bank of the Mississippi, opposite Jefferson Barracks. Bits of pot-
tery, chips of flint, and other traces of a settlement, together with
stone-lined graves in the vicinity of the mounds, may indicate the
position of a village of one of the Illinois tribes two centuries or
more ago.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Qs

Mr. B. S. Guha’s visit among the Utes and the Navaho at Towoac
and Shiprock, respectively, during the summer of 1921 was under-
taken primarily with the object of finding any legends or myths
about the ancient Cliff Dwellers of Mesa Verde that might still sur-
vive among these people, and incidentally to collect as much material
about their social institutions as possible.

Mr. Guha arrived at Towoac on July 14, 1921, and spent a couple
of weeks visiting the different camps of the Utes. Among the Wimi-
nuche Utes, unfortunately, there does not appear to survive any
legends or myths about the Mesa Verde. All that could be gathered
from the oldest living members of the tribe was that when their an-
cestors first came to the Ute Mountain from the north, the whole
region from the La Plata to the Blue Mountains and from Dolores
to the San Juan was full of ruins such as now may be seen. They
were already abandoned, but there were signs of the cultivation of
corn about them.

After leaving Towoac Mr. Guha went to Shiprock, N. Mex., and
stayed there until September 5, 1921. Unlike the Utes, the Navaho
seem to possess survivals of myths about the ancient Cliff Dwellers
of Mesa Verde. How far these legends have any historical back-
ground it is difficult to say, but they at any rate suggest some earlier
and closer relationhip between them and the people who lived in the
ruins so liberally strewn over the entire region.

In September, 1921, Mr. John L. Baer, acting curator of Amer-
ican archeology in the United States National Museum, made an
investigation for the bureau of pictographic rocks in the Susque-
hanna River. In the middle of the river between Bald Friar and
Conowingo, Md., are a number of huge boulders of serpentine or
gabbro, bearing inscriptions, a few of which have been heretofore
described in the Tenth Annual Report of the Bureau of American
Ethnology and in Volume CCC (Lancaster County), Second Geo-
logical Survey of Pennsylvania. The largest and most important of
these pictographic rocks were found to be on Miles’ Island at the
head of Gray Rock Falls. Large surfaces of these rocks seem to
have been polished before the figures were pecked upon them. Pits,
grooved lines indicating tally marks, circles with radiating spokes,
concentric circies, faces, and fishlike outlines were the prevailing
figures observed.

Other groups of rocks between this island and Conowingo showed
equally interesting carvings, but not so profusely. A pyramid-
shaped rock standing well out in the rough and dangerous rapids
had several fish outlined near its apex. A slab which had been
broken from its original position and which might have been used
for a shad-dipping stand, was marked with outlines of two slender
72 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

fish and two tally marks. A number of interesting photographs and
drawings of these pictographs were secured.

In connection with a reconnoitering trip among the prehistoric
quarries and workshops along the Susquehanna in the spring of
1922, Mr. Baer again visited these pictographic rocks and secured
additional drawings and a number of plaster casts of the more
important figures. Prehistoric steatite quarries were traced from
the west side of the river at this point to Deer Creek in Harford
County, Md. Those showing most work and offering best oppor-
tunities for investigation are near Broad Creek in woodland owned
by James McLaughlin, near Robinson’s mill, and by W. C. Heaps,
Mill Green, Harford County, Md.

At a workshop below Peach Bottom, Lancaster, Pa., a number of
unfinished and broken banner stones of prochlorite were found. The
source of the material was located a short distance east of Bald Friar,
Md. A large number of unfinished banner stones of slate were
found at the workshop on Mount Johnson Island above Peach Bot-
tom where so many specimens had already been found. At Fishing
Creek, Bare Island, and Henry Island evidences were found of con-
siderable camp sites. At New Park, and Fawn Grove in York
County, Pa., have been found large caches of rhyolite blades. At
both of these places and also at Peach Bottom in the same county
were many artifacts and indications of burial grounds. Interesting
specimens were secured from most of these localities.

LIBRARY.

The reference library continued in the immediate care of Miss Ella
Leary, librarian, assisted by Miss Julia S. Atkins and Mr. Samuel
H. Miller.
74 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

During the year 406 books were accessioned, of which 64 were
acquired by purchase, 120 by binding of periodicals, and 142 by
gift and exchange. The periodicals currently received number about
900, of which 33 are received by subscription, the remainder being
received through exchange. The bureau has also received 159
pamphlets, giving at the close of the year a working library of
24,561 volumes, 14,936 pamphlets, and several thousand unbound
periodicals.

In addition to the regular routine of library work, Miss Leary
has been able, with the assistance of Miss Atkins, to make rapid
progress toward the completion of the new subject catalogue, with
the result that about 18,000 catalogue cards have been filed during the
fiscal year.

The greatest need of the library is for more shelf room for its
publications, due to its growth during the past few years. The
library is greatly hampered by this need.

The posting of the monthly bulletin of new publications was
continued throughout the year.

During the year many students not connected with the Smithsonian
Institution found the library of service in seeking volumes not ob-
tainable in other libraries of the city. The library was used also by
the Library of Congress and officers of the executive departments,
and out-of-town students have called upon the library for loans
during the year. In addition to the use of its own library it was
found necessary to draw on the Library of Congress from time to
time for the loan of about 400 volumes.

There were bound during the year 200 books, pamphlets, and serial
publications.

COLLECTIONS.

The following collections, acquired by members of the bureau or
by those detailed in connection with its researches, have been trans-
ferred to the United States National Museum:

APPENDIX 5.
REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the International Exchange Service during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1922:

The appropriation granted by Congress for the support of the
service during the year was $50,000, the same as the amount for the
year 1921. The excess of these appropriations over those formerly
allowed for the system of international exchanges was designed to
meet the extraordinary expenses of forwarding, at the high ocean
and other transportation rates, the accumulations of packages that
were withheld awaiting the resumption of shipments to certain
foreign countries. In addition to the above appropriation, the usual
allotment of $200 for printing and binding was allowed by Congress.
The repayments from departmental and other establishments aggre-
gated $5,510.74, making the total resources available for carrying on
the system of exchanges for the year, $55,710.74.

During the year 1922 the total number of packages handled was
883,157, a decrease from the number for the preceding year of 68,314.
These packages weighed a total of 592,600 pounds, a decrease of
12,712. While in consequence of the return to nearly normal con-
ditions the figures just given show a falling off in the number and
weight of packages passing through the service from those handled
last year, the work during the fiscal year 1922 exceeded by 41,490 the
number of packages handled in 1914, just prior to the World War,
which indicates a steady increase in the work of the office.

The number and weight of the packages of different classes are
given in the following table:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 77

It should be stated here that the disparity in the above figures be-
tween the number of packages sent and those received is accounted
for in part by the fact that packages transmitted abroad often con-
tain only one publication, while those received in return frequently
comprise many volumes. In some instances, especially in the case of
publications received in exchange for parliamentary documents, the
term “ package” is applied to large boxes containing many separate
publications. Furthermore, many returns for publications sent
abroad reach their destinations in this country through the mails and
not through the exchange service.

I stated last year that the steps taken by the Institution looking to
the reopening of exchanges with Rumania and the establishment of
relations with the newly formed Government of Jugoslavia had not
led to a successful result. The Governments of both those countries
expressed a desire to have the shipment of international exchanges
resumed as soon as conditions would permit, but nothing further was
heard from either of them. An offer made during the latter part of
the year by the Institutul Meteorologic Central, Bukharest, and the
Académie Royale Serbe des Sciences et des Arts, Belgrade, to serve
as agencies for their respective countries was therefore accepted by
the Institution, and a shipment of 26 boxes was made to the former
and 69 to the latter. The exchange agency in Rumania was formerly
the Academia Romana and in Serbia the Ministére des Affaires
Etrangéres.

During the year exchange relations have been established with the
newly formed Governments of Esthonia, Far Eastern Republic,
Latvia, Lithuania, and Ukrainia.

The conditions in Russia and Turkey have not yet improved suffi-
ciently to warrant the Institution in taking steps to renew the ex-
change of publications between those countries and the United States.

The Institution requested several New York forwarding agents to
submit rates for handling and forwarding exchange consignments
abroad, the rates to take effect on July 1, 1922. The proposal sub-
mitted by the present agents, Messrs. Davies, Turner & Co., 39 Pearl
Street, New York City, was found to be the lowest, and shipments
will therefore continue to be sent to foreign countries through that
firm.

There were shipped abroad during the year 3,215 boxes, being an
increase of 463 over the number for the preceding 12 months. This is
the largest number of boxes forwarded through the exchange service
in one year and is due in great measure to the opening of exchange
relations with Jugoslavia and several of the independent Russian
States, the packages for those countries having accumulated at the
Institution for several years. The number of boxes shipped was fur-
78

ther augmented by the forwarding to Austria of a large number of
United States patent specifications that were held during the war.
Of the total number of boxes sent abroad 394 contained full sets of
United States official documents for foreign depositories, and 2,821
included departmental and other publications for depositories of
partial sets and for miscellaneous correspondents.
It is gratifying to state that during the year the office has been able
to return to its regular schedule of shipments to foreign countries.
Consignments are now being forwarded to Great Britain and Ger-
many weekly, to France and Italy semimonthly, and to all other

countries monthly.

The number of boxes sent to each country is given in the following

FOREIGN DEPOSITORIES OF UNITED STATES GOVERNMENTAL
DOCUMENTS.

The number of sets of governmental documents forwarded abroad
through the International Exchange Service to foreign depositories
has been reduced during the year by one, the partial set formerly
sent to Montenegro having been discontinued as that country is now
a part of the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and Slovenes, which
receives a full set. The total number of sets of governmental docu-
ments distributed through the service is therefore 95, 57 full and
38 partial. The set sent to the Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats, and
Slovenes is entered in the following list under Jugoslavia.

The name of the Austrian depository has been changed from the
Statistische Zentral Kommission to the Bundesamt fiir Statistik.

A complete list of the depositories is given below:

INTERPARLIAMENTARY EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL JOURNALS.

The Library of the League of Nations, Geneva, Switzerland, and
the Riigi Raamatukogu, Toompea, Reval, Esthonia, have been added
to the list of those countries receiving the daily Congressional
Record.

Mention was made in my last report of the fact that the Govern-
ment of Poland had entered into the immediate exchange with the
United States, although it had not signified its adherence to the
Brussels convention providing for such exchange. During the year
the Institution was advised through diplomatic channels that the
Polish Government, in the exercise of the privilege granted to non-
signatory States by Article 2 of Exchange Convention B of March
15, 1886, had declared its adherence to that diplomatic instrument.

Following is a complete list of the addresses to which the daily
Congressional Record is now sent:

establishments.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE AGENCIES.

It will be noted from the following list of exchange agencies that
shipments are now being made to Esthonia, the Far Eastern Re-
public, Yugoslavia, Latvia, Lithuania, Rumania, and Ukrainia.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 83

The Teachers’ College at Vladivostok is the agency for the Far
Eastern Republic; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at Riga, for
Latvia; the Académie Royale Serbe des Sciences et des Arts at
Belgrade, for Yugoslavia; and the Institutul Meteorologic Central
in Bukharest, for Rumania. Only a few packages have thus far
been received for Lithuania, and, for the present, transmissions to
that country will be made through the mails. Shipments were made
to the university libraries at Dorpat and at Odessa, with the request
that those libraries distribute the consignments and also act as the
agencies for Esthonia and Ukrainia, respectively. As these ship-
ments were not made until near the close of the year, replies have
not yet been received from those establishments. It is anticipated,
however, that both will consent to serve as exchange agencies.

RULES GOVERNING THE TRANSMISSION OF EXCHANGES.

A revised edition of the circular containing a brief description of
the service and the rules under which packages are accepted for dis-
tribution, was published at the close of the year and is here repro-
duced for the information of any who may desire to make use
of the service in the forwarding of publications.

In effecting the distribution of its first publications abroad, the Smith-
sonian Institution established relations with many foreign scientific societies
and libraries, by means of which it was enabled to materially assist institu-
tions and individuals of this country in the transmission of their publications
abroad, and also foreign societies and individuals in distributing their publi-
cations in the United States.

In more recent years the Smithsonian Institution has been charged with the
duty of conducting the official exchange bureau of the United States Gov-
ernment, through which the publications authorized by Congress are ex-
changed for those of other Governments; and by a formal treaty it acts as
intermediary between the learned bodies and Scientific and literary societies
of this and other countries for the reception and transmission of their pub-
lications.

Attention is called to the fact that this is an international and not a
domestic exchange service, and that it is designed to facilitate exchanges be-
tween the United States and other countries only. As publications from
domestic sources for addresses in Hawaii, the Philippine Islands, Porto Rico,
and other territory subject to the jurisdiction of the United States do not
come within the designation ‘international,’ they are not accepted by the
Institution for transmission through the service.

Packages prepared in accordance with the rules enumerated below will
be received by the Smithsonian Institution from individuals or institutions
of learning in the United States and forwarded to their destinations abroad
through the various exchange bureaus or agencies in other countries. Many
of these bureaus and agencies will likewise receive from correspondents in
their countries such publications for addresses in the United States and its
dependencies as may be delivered to them under rules similar to those pre-
scribed herein, and will forward them to Washington, after which the Insti-
tution will transmit them te their destinations by mail free of cost to the
recipients.

553879—24—_7
86 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

On the receipt of a consignment from a domestic source it is assigned a
“record number,” which number is, for identification purposes, placed on
each package contained therein. After the packages have been recorded
they are packed in boxes with consignments from other senders and are
forwarded by freight to the bureaus or agencies abroad which have under-
taken to distribute exchanges in those countries. To Great Britain and
Germany shipments are made weekly, to France and Italy semimonthly, and
to all other countries consignments are forwarded at intervals not exceeding
one month.

The Institution assumes no responsibility in the transmission of packages
intrusted to its care, but at all times uses its best endeavors to forward ex-
changes to their destinations safely and as promptly as possible. Especial
attention should be called in this connection to the time ordinarily required
for packages sent through the exchange service to reach their destinations.
To Great Britain and Germany, for example, where weekly shipments are made,
the average time for a package to reach its destination is about six weeks. In
some instances the period is much shorter and in no case should it be longer
unless there is some unavoidable delay at the ports of embarkation or debarka-
tion. To those countries to which shipments.are made at semimonthly and
monthly intervals, the time of delivery is of course somewhat longer, depending
on the distance and also whether packages are received at the Institution im-
mediately before or after a shipment. If, therefore, advance notices are
mailed by senders, mention should be made of the above facts in order that
consignees may expect some delay between the receipt of notices and the
arrival of packages. In cases where greater dispatch is desired, publica-
tions should be forwarded by the senders to their foreign destinations direct
by mail,

BULES.

The rules governing the Smithsonian International Exchange Service are as
follows:

1. Consignments from correspondents in the United States containing pack-
ages for transmission abroad should be addressed—“ Smithsonian Institution,
International Exchanges, Washington, D. C.,” and forwarded with carriage
charges to Washington prepaid.

2. In forwarding a consignment the sender should mail a letter to the
Institution, stating by what route it is being shipped, and the number of
boxes or parcels which it comprises. A list giving the name and address of
each consignee should also be furnished. This request should invariably be
complied with for record.

3. Packages should be legibly and fully addressed, using, when practicable,
the language of the country to which they are to be forwarded. In order to
avoid any possible dispute as to ownership, names of individuals should be
omitted from packages intended for societies and other establishments.

4, Packages should be securely wrapped and cardboard used if necessary
to protect plates from crumpling.

5. Letters are not permitted in exchange packages.

6. If donors desire acknowledgments, packages may contain receipt forms
to be signed and returned by the establishment or individual addressed.
Should publications be desired in exchange, a request to that effect may be
printed on the receipt form or on the package.

7. The work carried on by the International Exchange Service is not in any
sense of a commercial nature, but is restricted to the transmission of pub-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 87

lications sent as exchanges or donations. Books sold or ordered through
the trade are, therefore, necessarily excluded.

8. Specimens are not accepted for distribution, except when permission has
been obtained from the Institution.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX 6.
REPORT ON THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

Sm: I have the honor to present the following report on the
operations of the National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1922:

The appropriation allowed by Congress in the sundry civil act
approved March 4, 1921, for the regular maintenance of the park
was the same as for the preceding year, $125,000, with the usual
additional allotment of $200 for printing and binding. The sum of
$2,500, together with an unobligated balance of $2,403.66 left from
the appropriation for alteration of boundaries, 1921, was also made
available, as a continuing appropriation, for the purchase of land
to correct the eastern boundary line near the Adams Mill Road
entrance.

The year has been one of the most successful in the history of the
park. A number of minor permanent improvements have been
completed, progress has been made on some larger undertakings,
and the grounds have been maintained in a condition gratifying
to all who are interested in the great natural beauty of the reserva-
tion. At the close of the year the collection is larger, and of more
importance, than ever before; more different species are on exhibi-
tion, and the actual number of animals is greater than in any previous
year; there are more than the usual number of rare and valuable
specimens; the births have been numerous; and the death rate has
been kept at a low mark. For the third successive year the attend-
ance has exceeded 2,000,000.

ACCESSIONS.

Gifts.—No less than 217 animals, an unusual number, were added
to the collection as gifts, or were placed by friends of the park on
indefinite deposit. Special mention in this connection should be
made of two important collections from South America.

The collections of living animals made by Dr. William M. Mann
on the Mulford Biological Exploration of the Amazon Basin reached
the park on April 15, 1922. Included were 15 mammals, 50 birds,
and 17 reptiles that arrived in perfect condition, and a very few
others lost from the effects of travel. These were all generously
presented to the park by the H. K. Mulford Co., of Philadelphia.

88
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 89

Doctor Mann is to be congratulated on his success in bringing te
the country live representatives of several species from Bolivia and
western Brazil that have never before been shown. The red-faced
spider monkey, black-headed woolly monkey, pale capuchin, choliba
screech owl, Bolivian penelope, short-tailed parrot, Maximilian’s
parrot, blue-headed parrot, Cassin’s macaw, golden-crowned paro-
quet, Weddell’s paroquet, orange-winged paroquet, and golden-
winged paroquet are new to the collection. These and other rarities
are mostly from the Rio Beni, Bolivia, and the upper Rio Madeira,
Brazil, localities from which animals seldom find their way into
collections. Other species, including such rare birds as the festive
parrot, Amazonian caique, and white-backed trumpeter, while not
new to the park records, are unusual. There were also some showy
birds and small mammals from the lower Amazon as well as an
excellent collection of living reptiles. On account of the great pro-
portion of rare species it contained and the unusually good condi-
tion of the specimens on arrival, the Mulford Explorations collection
easily ranks as the most important accession received from tropical
America in some years.

Mr. W. J. La Varre, jr., continuing his donations from personal
exploration of out-of-the-way parts of South America, presented
28 birds and mammals from the interior of British Guiana. Con-
spicuous among these are a cock of the rock, a Hahn’s macaw, and
two dusky parrots, all new to the collection. Mr. La Varre also
succeeded in landing a young red howler monkey. The cock of the
rock, a young bird in immature plumage on arrival, has now de-
veloped into full color and is one of the most showy and attractive
exhibits in the bird house.

Mr. Victor J. Evans, of Washington, D. C., long a regular con-
tributor to the collection, purchased and placed on indefinite de-
posit a Cape great-eared fox and two yellow-billed hornbills, both
species new to the records of the park. The long-eared fox, received
from South Africa, is doubtless the first representative of its species
ever exhibited alive in America.

Sixty-eight individual donors contributed to the collection during
the year. The complete list is as follows:

Mrs. Benjamin E. Abbott, Washington, D. C., Virginia opossum.

Dr. Arthur A. Allen, Ithaca, N. Y., 10 greater scaup ducks.

American Express Co., Washington, D. C., 4 chipmunks.

Mrs, R, P, Andrews, Washington, D. C., Cuban parrot.

Mr. Carl Bandrexler, Washington, D. C., copperhead.

Mr. Murrell Barkley, Washington, D. C., 2 tovi paroquets.

Births.—During the year 58 mammals and 28 reptiles were born,
and 64 birds were hatched in the park. These records include only
such as are reared to a reasonable age, no account being made in
these published statistics of young that live only a few days. Mam-
mals born include: Manchurian tiger, 4; dingo, 6; Florida otter, 3;
raccoon, 2; gray wolf, 1; hippopotamus, 1; Rocky Mountain sheep, 1;
tahr, 1; East African eland, 1; American bison, 1; llama, 1; Indian
antelope, 1; Virginia deer, 3; hog deer, 2; Japanese deer, 5; fallow
deer, 2; red deer, 5; barasingha, 1; brush-tailed rock wallaby, 2;
rufous-bellied wallaby, 3; black-tailed wallaby, 1; great red kanga-
roo, 5; wallaroo, 1; Trinidad agouti, 2; rhesus monkey, 2; green
guenon, 1. Reptiles: Ground rattlesnake, 1; copperhead, 27. Birds
hatched were of the following species: Greater snow goose, Canada
goose, wood duck, pintail, black duck, mallard, American coot, black-
crowned night heron, peafowl, ring-necked pheasant, and European
wood pigeon.

The young Manchurian tigers were born August 19, 1921, and at
the close of the year were fine, thrifty animals, of good growth. The
hippopotamus, born April 27, 1922, is the third young successfully
reared in the gardens from the same pair of animals. The success
in rearing a young mountain sheep ram last year makes it seem
probable that the lamb born this spring will also develop into a
perfect animal.

E'xchanges——A number of valuable animals were received in ex-
change for surplus stock. The accessions include 19 mammals, 166
birds, and 8 reptiles. Special mention should be made of a panda,
three yellow-footed rock wallabies, an aard-wolf, and a Hagenbeck’s
mangabey, none of which have before been on exhibition in the
92 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

gardens. The panda is the only Old World representative of the
raccoon family and is an animal of striking appearance. It comes
from the high Himalaya Mountains of northern India. The aard-
wolf of South Africa has probably never before been shown alive in
America, It is related to the hyenas but is chiefly insectivorous in
its habits and lacks the powerful dental equipment of most of the
carnivores. Other mammals received in exchange are a lioness,
aoudad, great anteater, cape bushbuck, sable antelope, two Malay
tapirs, a wombat, brown woolly monkey, anubis baboon, vervet
guenon, and two Japanese monkeys.

Among the birds received in exchange special mention should be
made of the following species: Hawaiian goose, bean goose, Euro-
pean pochard, tufted duck, European lapwing, greater vasa parrot,
and African black vulture.

A regal python, 25 feet long, was received in exchange. This is
the largest snake ever exhibited in the park.

Purchases.—A brindled gnu from South Africa, and a young male
American elk, were purchased during the year. In addition to these
a few small common mammals and birds were purchased at low cost.

Transfers.—An especially fine collection of ostriches, 12 birds in
all, were transferred to the park from the United States poultry ex-
periment station, Bureau of Animal Industry, Glendale, Ariz. The
lot includes selected representatives of the Somaliland, Nubian, and
South African species, and comprises probably the finest show of
ostriches in America.

Through the Biological Survey, Department of Agriculture, were
received a number of animals collected by field agents of the
bureau. These include a badger from Mr. R. E. Bateman, Billings,
Mont.; 2 gray wolves: from Mr. Charles J. Bayer, Cheyenne,
Wyo.; 7 beavers from Mr. Vernon Bailey, chief field naturalist; a
wood duck and a cardinal from Mr. George A. Lawyer, chief game
warden; a desert tortoise from Mr. M. E. Musgrave, Phoenix,
Ariz.; and 12 Florida gopher tortoises from the survey labora-
tories.

The Bureau of Fisheries, Department of Commerce, contributed
5 specimens of the snapping turtle.

REMOVALS.

Surplus animals to the number of 44 were sent away during the
year in exchange for other stock. Among these were the following
mammals that had been born and reared in the park: Indian water
buffalo, 1; American bison, 1; Rocky Mountain sheep, 1; Indian
antelope, 1; llama, 2; guanaco, 1; red deer, 7; Japanese deer, 3;
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 93

barasingha, 1; dingo, 2; gray wolf, 1; European brown bear, 4; red
kangaroo, 2; and rufous-bellied wallaby, 2.

A number of animals on deposit were returned to owners.

While the death rate has been kept low for the collection as a
whole, there have been some serious losses of animals long in the
park. The records of some of these, interesting because of longev-
ity in captivity, are as follows: A black vulture (Coragyps urubu)
received as a bird of the year November 26, 1900, was killed by its
cage mate, a bird of the same species, December 28, 1921, 21 years,
1 month, and 2 days after arrival. A female South American
tapir, received from Demerara August 28, 1901, then about 4 years
of age, died September 7, 1921, after 20 years and 10 days of life
in the National Zoological Park. Nine young were born to this
animal during this period, seven of which were reared. The im-
mediate cause of death was tuberculosis. A male gray wolf (Canis
nubilus), born in the park March 29, 1905, died at an age of 16
years, 3 months, and 5 days, on July 4, 1921. A male llama, born
in the park April 28, 1907, died of pyemia at an age of 14 years, 10
months, and 7 days, on March 7, 1922. A female California sea
lion received May 25, 1907, died 14 years, 2 months, and 5 days
after arrival on July 30, 1921. A cariama (Cariama cristata) re-
ceived from Dr. Clemente Onelli, director of the Municipal Zoologi-
cal Gardens, Buenos Aires, March 14, 1908, died 13 years, 4 months,
and 1 day later, on July 15, 1921. A grizzly bear, male, received
from the Yellowstone National Park July 29, 1908, died March 27,
1922. This bear was about 34 years old on arrival, lived in the park
13 years, 7 months, and 28 days, and its death was clearly due
to advanced age. ‘The female harbor seal (Phoca vitulina), re-
ceived January 19, 1910, died of enteritis on March 9, 1922, after 12
years, 1 month, and 18 days of life in the park. A female wart
hog, presented by Mr. W. N. McMillan, which reached the park
December 19, 1909, died July 29, 1921, 11 years, 7 months, and 10
days after arrival. A female kinkajou (Potos flavus), received
from Panama June 17, 1910, died after 11 years, 1 month, and 5
days of life in the park, on July 22, 1921. A female Woodhouse’s
wolf (Canis frustror), born in the park April 17, 1911, died Janu-
ary 7, 1922, at an age of 10 years, 8 months, and 21 days. A female
gray coatimundi (Nasua narica) received April 2, 1913, died Feb-
ruary 22, 1922, after 8 years, 10 months, and 20 days in the park.
The European badger (J/eles meles) received from the London
Zoological Gardens May 1, 1915, died 6 years, 6 months. and 11
days later, on November 12, 1921.

Other serious losses include the Florida manatee from septic
peritonitis, July 16, 1921; Mongolian wild horse (Hquus przewal-

skit) from inflammation of bladder, November 27, 1921; an Arabian
camel, hemorrhagic cystitis, April 3, 1922; a female Rocky Moun-
tain sheep from metroperitonitis, June 6, 1922; two Count Raggi’s
birds of paradise, enteritis, February 7 and 9, 1922; and the last
trumpeter swan, the property of Mr. R. M. Barnes, Lacon, IL,
which had been on deposit since April 15, 1917. The swan died
of tuberculosis of the liver on June 14, 1922.

Post-mortem examinations were made, in most cases, by the
pathological division of the Bureau of Animal Industry. Two
examinations were made by Dr. Adolph H. Schultz, of the Carnegie
Institution, Laboratory of Embryology, and one by Dr. C. W.
Stiles at the Hygienic Laboratory, Bureau of Public Health Serv-
ice. The following list shows the results of autopsies, the cases
being arranged by groups:

The collection is now larger than ever before. The number of
species on exhibition on June 30 is 4 more, and the total number of
animals is 130 more than in any previous year.

VISITORS.

The total number of visitors to the park, for the fiscal year, as
determined by count and estimate, was 2,164,254. This is the third
year that the attendance has exceeded 2,000,000. The greatest at-
tendance in any one month was 394,703 in April, 1922, an average
per day of 13,156.

The attendance by months was as follows:

IMPROVEMENTS.

The work of grading in the west central part of the park, com-
menced six years ago but discontinued during the war, was again
taken up and the major part of the leveling and filling, as originally
planned, was completed during the year. A large area of ground
is now available for comparatively level paddocks for the exhibition
of hoofed animals, and the way is opened up for decided improve-
ments in the main roadway traversing the park. Many trees re-
moved during this work were cut into logs and, during the winter,
sawed into lumber of suitable grades for regular use.

The entire western wall of the antelope house, involving the cages
and yards, long in a bad state of repair, was entirely rebuilt. The
lower part was extended out, with concrete walls and new roof.
The platform and approach to the eastern entrance were also re-
modeled. The building has been greatly improved in appearance
and the animals have been given much more satisfactory quarters.

The older bear dens near the Harvard Street entrance were thor-
oughly repaired, provided with new concrete floor, tank, and gutter,
and the ironwork painted.

Three large outdoor cages for hawks, owls, and Australian grass
paroquets were constructed; the Henderson outdoor parrot cage was
covered with new wire and painted; the inside quarters for hippo-
potamuses and tapirs repaired and enlarged; a concrete storehouse
for paints and oils was built near the machine shop; the tennis
courts were improved; repairs were made to the heating service in
the monkey and lion houses; an electric pump and motor was in-
stalled at the pelican pond so that water from the creek can be
used; and the gap in the boundary fence along the southern border
of the park was closed by a new wire fence.

At the close of the year considerable progress had been made in
a complete rebuilding of the old wolf yards and fox dens below the
sea-lion pool.

ALTERATIONS OF BOUNDARIES.

There is available for the purchase of a narrow strip of land near
the Adams Mill Road entrance, between the present park boundary
and Adams Mill Road, $4,903.66. On March 24, 1921, the atten-
tion of the Secretary of the Treasury was called to the provisions
of the sundry civil act relating to the purchase of this land. The
matter was referred to the United States attorney’s office, and, the
owners having declined to sell within the limits set by the act for
purchase by agreement, steps were taken toward the institution of
proceedings of condemnation. During the past year no further
progress has been reported,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 103
IMPORTANT NEEDS.

Restaurant.—A_ suitable restaurant building remains the most
urgent need of the park. As pointed out in previous reports the
old refreshment stand, originally constructed when the attendance
was very small, is in a bad condition and is wholly inadequate to
serve the needs of the public. Following the acquisition by the park
of a large quantity of valuable chestnut and oak timbers and lumber,
as mentioned in the report for last year, and in consideration of
the fact that much of the work of construction can now be done by
regular park employees, the estimated necessary appropriation for
such a structure as is needed has been reduced to $20,000. The old
refreshment stand at the Connecticut Avenue entrance, on land re-
cently transferred to the Government as an addition to the park,
should also be replaced by a new and more sightly booth. The in-
creased income from rental of these two concessions will well repay
for the construction of buildings adequate for the service of the
constantly increasing number of visitors.

Bird house.—Estimates for a new bird house were submitted
for several years prior to the war, but were never favorably acted
upon by Congress. The need for a new building for the exhibition
of birds is now greater than ever before. The old building was
constructed of the cheapest materials many years ago, as a tempo-
rary relief, and it is now in a very bad state of repair. It also
provides far too little space for the collection and far too little room
for visitors; on days of large attendance the public aisles are greatly
overcrowded. The collection of birds is one of great importance,
containing as it does numerous rare, interesting, and beautiful
species; and new arrangements for its care and exhibition to the
public should not much longer be delayed.

Respectfully submitted.

Superintendent.

Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX 7.
REPORT ON THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

Srmr: The Astrophysical Observatory was conducted under the fol-
lowing passage of the sundry civil act, approved March 4, 1921:

Astrophysical Observatory: For maintenance of the Astrophysical Observa-
tory, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, including assistants,
purchase of necessary books and periodicals, apparatus, making necessary
observations in high altitudes, repairs and alterations of buildings, and mis-
cellaneous expenses, $15,500.

The observatory occupies a number of frame structures within an
inclosure of about 16,000 square feet south of the Smithsonian ad-
ministration building at Washington, and also a cement observing
station and frame cottage for observers on a plot of 10,000 square
feet leased from the Carnegie Solar Observatory on Mount Wilson,
Calif.

A new solar observing station on Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., was
erected in July, 1920, at the expense of funds donated for the pur-
pose by Mr. John A. Roebling, of Bernardsville, N. J., and this
station has been occupied as a solar radiation observing station by the
Astrophysical Observatory since October, 1920.

The present value of the buildings and equipment for the Astro-
physical Observatory, owned by the Government, is estimated at
$50,000. This estimate contemplates the cost required to replace
the outfit for the purposes of the investigation.

WORK OF THE YEAR.

At Washington.—The director, with Mr. Fowle and Mrs. Bond,
was engaged much of the year on the preparation and proof reading
of Volume IV of the Annals of the Observatory. This quarto
volume of 390 pages, including 60 illustrations and 118 pages of
numerical tables, covers the work of the years 1912 to 1920, and
was published in June, 1922. New apparatus and methods of ob-
serving are described and illustrated, and a large mass of solar
observations is presented and discussed. Evidence is given of many
kinds which indicates the solar variability. Reference is made to
applications of the results which have been made by several me-
teorologists. .

In preparation for work proposed for the expedition to Mount
Wilson in the summer of 1922, Mr. Aldrich, in consultation with

104
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 105

the director, prepared the sensitive parts of a galvanometer and
a vacuum bolometer of usual types for solar work, and also of a
vacuum galvanometer and vacuum bolometer of very unusual design
suited to observing the energy distribution in the spectra of the
stars. These extremely delicate and sensitive instruments required
extraordinary skill and patience for their construction and testing.
Acknowledgments are due the Director of the Bureau of Standards,
the Director of the Nela Research Laboratory, and also Dr. Elihu
Thomson, of Lynn, for aiding these preparations.

The instrument making for these new pieces and others required
in the expedition to Mount Wilson, including a special spectrometer,
plate carrier, and other apparatus, was done by the instrument
maker, Mr. A. Kramer.

A great many of the “ solar constant ” observations made at Mount
Harqua Hala, Ariz., were reduced by Mr. Fowle and Mrs. Bond in
consultation with the director. Despite our long experience in
solar-radiation work, new problems and difficulties still crop up.
The publication of the Mount Harqua Hala results has hitherto been
withheld so that a comprehensive discussion of them might be made
to reveal and correct any systematic errors.

Expedition to Chile—lt became necessary for the director to un-
dertake a visit to Chile to inspect the observing station at Monte-
zuma maintained by the Hodgkins fund for the study of the solar
variations, in cooperation with the stations in California and Ari-
zona. Leaving Washington near the end of October, 1921, he spent
the month, November 15 to December 15, at the station and returned
to Washington early in January, 1922. During the month at Mon-
tezuma he revised all the adjustments of apparatus and some of the
methods employed there, besides assisting in the daily observations
and reductions on 26 days. Silver disk pyrheliometer S. I. No. 5,
loaned by the Department of Agriculture for the purpose, was com-
pared with instruments at Montezuma, and before and afterwards
with instruments at Washington. No change in the scale of pyr-
heliometry was disclosed by these comparisons.

Expedition to Mount Wilson.—In June an axibilieieny including
the director and Mr. L. B. Aldrich, went out to Mount Wilson.
Four objects were in view. First, to inspect the station at Mount
Harqua Hala and compare pyrheliometers there with silver disk
pyrheliometer S. I. No. 5, above mentioned, so as to connect the
fundamental scales of pyrheliometry in Arizona and Chile. Second,
to repeat with all possible precautions and variations of method the
determination of the form of the solar spectrum energy curve out-
side the atmosphere. Third, to undertake preliminary measurements
of the distribution of energy in the spectra of the brighter stars,
106 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922,

Fourth, to try further experiments with the collection and storage
of solar heat for cooking purposes.

The station on Mount Harqua Hala was visited by the director
and found in a highly improved condition owing to the zeal of Mr.
Moore, in charge there. The laboratory has been sheathed outside
with metal to protect the adobe walls from rain, and painted and
embellished within, lightning rods have been installed, a small shop
built, wireless telephonic apparatus erected, a garage built at the
foot of the mountain trail, and regular weekly mail and supply
trips arranged. Solar-constant observations have been made on
upward of 70 per cent of the days of the year, and much computing
and testing attended to. Comparisons made during and after the
director’s visit show no change in the scale of pyrheliometry, so
that as far as this is concerned the results at Harqua Hala are com-
parable with those at Montezuma. But from lack of sensitiveness
of the galvanometer the energy curves show less detail at Harqua
Hala, and this it was decided must be corrected as early as possible
to put the two stations on parallel footings.

In conversation with Mr. Moore, the director devised a new im-
provement of the “short method” which, it was agreed, would pro-
mote accuracy while greatly abridging computation. This will be
introduced at both stations as soon as the new determination of the
form of the solar energy curve outside the atmosphere is worked out.

At Mount Wilson, the time before the end of the fiscal year, June
30, only sufficed for a partial installation of new “solar constant”
apparatus replacing that which in 1920 was removed to Harqua
Hala. But it may be said by anticipation that later results were
secured on the distribution of energy in the spectra of 11 of the
brighter stars by bolometric work in connection with the 100-inch
telescope, and also that the solar energy curve was traced bolo-
metrically with both glass and rock-salt prisms. With the latter,
experiments were made at wave lengths from far down in the ultra-
violet to an infra-red wave length of 14 microns, with allowance for
stray light and for atmospheric and instrumental transmission.

Unfortunately the cover of the oil reservoir of the solar cooking
apparatus had been blown off in a very high wind, and snow hav-
ing gotten in, much water had leaked into the oil reservoir. After
a long time of fruitlessly attempting to boil out this water, the oil
and water were at length removed, but not in time to undertake the
proposed new experiments before the return of the expedition to
Washington in September.

OPINIONS OF THE SOLAR RADIATION WORK.

As the Institution is making great efforts to continue and to im-
prove its solar-radiation measurements, the director felt concerned
to invite the opinions of competent critics, in order to know if these
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, 107

labors seemed quite justified by their probable outcome. Accord-
ingly, in a report to the American representatives of the Interna-
tional Astronomical Union he wrote as follows:

It is the intention of the Smithsonian Institution to continue daily observa-
tions at Mount Harqua Hala and Montezuma certainly until July, 1923, at
which time it is proposed to consider the state of the work and the results
reached with a view to deciding whether it is worth while to continue daily
observations of the variability of the sun indefinitely or whether the useful-
ness of that work is unequal to the trouble and expense involved.

An expression of opinion on the part of those interested in the subject would
be of great value to the Smithsonian Institution in making this decision.

In their meeting at Washington, April 3 and 4, 1922, the assembled
American representatives, including meteorologists, physicists, and
astronomers, passed unanimously, after earnest supporting speeches,
the following resolution :

Solar radiation—Moved: That it is the sense of the American section of
the International Astronomical Union that the continuation of the solar-
radiation work under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution in at least
two stations is highly desirable, both from an astronomical and a meteorological
point of view. Adopted.

Later, in the Congress at Rome, May 2, 1922, the international
representatives indorsed this opinion with equal unanimity and
earnestness, passing the following resolution:

The section of meteorology of the International Geodetic and Geophysical
Union records its appreciation of the excellent work done by the Astrophysical
Observatory of the Smithsonian Institution of Washington in determining with
a high degree of accuracy the intensity of solar radiation outside the earth’s
atmosphere. It is of the opinion that the daily values now being obtained
at Mount Montezuma, Chile, and Mount Harqua Hala, Ariz., will prove of
great value in te solution of certain meteorological problems. It therefore
expresses the hope that these determinations may be continued for a consider-
able period of years.

PROPOSED SOLAR RADIATION STATIONS,

In view of these impartial expert opinions, it is a pleasure to add
that Mr. John A. Roebling has made it possible to assure the con-
tinuation of the solar-constant stations at Harqua Hala and Monte-
zuma until July, 1925. By that time sufficient data will doubtless
be secured to prove whether they ought to be continued longer.

A movement is being made in Australia, led by Rev. E. F. Pigot,
of Riverview College, to provide a solar-constant observing station
similar to those maintained by the Smithsonian Institution. Funds
have been raised there, and a portion of the apparatus has been
purchased from the Institution. Also the Meteorological Service
of Argentina is proposing to equip its station at La Quiaca for
similar observations, in order the more directly to support the regu-
108 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

lar weekly long-range forecasts which it bases on solar radiation
results. In order to aid these enterprises, the director has designed
a full set of solar-constant apparatus, and it is expected that within
the next fiscal year two sets will be prepared by contract for the
Australian and Argentine stations.

PERSONNEL.

Mr. A. F. Moore, field director at Mount Harqua Hala, was added
to the staff of the Astrophysical Observatory on July 1, 1921.

SUMMARY.

The outstanding event of the fiscal year was the publication in
June, 1922, of Volume IV of the Annals of the Astrophysical Observ-
itory, covering results from 1912 to 1920. New apparatus and
methods are described, a critical survey of the work is given, and
long tabular summaries of all solar observations made are included.
From these results it is indicated in numerous ways that the sun’s
output of radiation varies, that the march of its variations depends
on the sun’s rotation, and that it produces effects of several kinds
on terrestrial physics and meteorology. Much progress has been
made at the new station on Mount Harqua Hala. Solar-constant
observations were made there on over 70 per cent of the days, but
are withheld from publication until completely discussed for evi-
dences as to systematic errors. Expeditions were made to Chile and
to Mount Wilson.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF
SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the opera-
tions of the United States Bureau of the International Catalogue of
Scientific Literature for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1922.

Although the financial conditions of this enterprise were, in com-
mon with all other international interests, practically crippled in
the beginning of the war, almost all of the regional bureaus have
continued to collect and prepare for future publication this index
of the world’s scientific literature. The activities of this regional
bureau have been continued as usual and the data relating to
American scientific literature is regularly being prepared ready to
forward to the London Central Bureau whenever it is found pos-
sible to resume publication.

An international convention is to be held in Brussels beginning
July 22, 1922, to determine the future of the catalogue, and the
Smithsonian Institution has prepared and will submit to the dele-
gates then present the following statement of its position:

PROPOSALS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION REGARDING THE INTERNATIONAL
CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE,

It is the belief of the Smithsonian Institution:

1. That a classified subject and author index to the literature of science is
needed.

2. That no better means exists of attaining the end sought than by carrying
out the original plan of the International Catalogue based on international
cooperation guided by uniform rules and schedules modified to meet changes
in the several sciences and, when possible, broadened in scope to include the
allied technical branches of these sciences.

8. That every effort should be made to cooperate with all similar enter-
prises, including abstracting agencies, existing or projected, not only to
prevent duplication of labor but also to better serve the demands of those in
need of bibliographic aid.

4, That on account of abnormal conditions still controlling publishing costs
and monetary exchange it is probable that actual publication can not be
at present resumed unless financial aid is had from some source outside the
present organization; however, it is believed:

5. That the international organization should be kept in being through
mutual agreement to continue the work of the regional bureaus until such
time as it may be economically possible to resume publication. When that

109
110 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

time arrives the stock of complete sets already published should be advertised
for sale at a price within the reach of the smaller libraries and institutions,
many of whom, although desiring this unique reference work, were prevented
from subscribing on account of the high original cost.

Were the price reduced even to one-fourth of the original, stock on hand
at that figure represents a sufficient sum to meet all outstanding obligations
and leave a surplus for working capital.

The intention in preparing this statement was to take into con-
sideration all existing conditions, and it is believed that if the
suggestions are indorsed by the convention, the organization may be
kept in being through the continued activities of the various re-
gional bureaus and that when international conditions become more
stable the central bureau will be able to meet its financial obligations
and resume publication.

When in 1896, 1898, and 1900, the representatives of practically
all the civilized nations and foremost scientific institutions met in
London to consider and formulate organic rules making possible
cooperation between all nations recording scientific investigations,
it was their intention not only to produce a catalogue and index of
published records as an aid to investigators and bibliographers,
but also to establish international cooperation to aid in developing
and making available to all those in any way concerned in scientific
matters the world’s output of scientific records. The material for
the 17 annual volumes of the International Catalogue of Scientific
Literature issued for the years 1901 to 1914, inclusive, was col-
lected by some 33 regional bureaus and published by the central
bureau in London. This unique international cooperative organiza-
tion, in the main, still exists and although actual publication has, for
financial reasons, been suspended pending a more nearly normal con-
dition in international finance and politics, the work of collecting
and preparing for publication the records of scientific research is
still going on. It would now seem advisable to consider how, until
the catalogue can be again published, these records may be made
available and to plan for the future improvement and extension of
the catalogue service.

The principal methods of furnishing information of the published
records of scientific investigations are: Card indexes and periodical
bibliographies; abstract journals; year books, cumulative cata-
logues, and indexes.

To prepare any of these, a complete list of journals is needed
but unfortunately no such complete current list now exists. One
of the first needs of the catalogue organization, when publication is
resumed, will be to bring its own list of journals up to date, the
last supplement to the original list having been published in 1904,
making the total number of journals listed at that time, 5,627. Since
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY, UG ig)

there is, aside from its use in connection with the catalogue, a decided
need and demand for such a lst, this bureau is considering the
advisability of undertaking the preparation of a revised list of
journals, and of soliciting to that end the cooperation of the existing
regional bureaus, who would be requested, through the central
bureau, to furnish lists of the periodicals published in their several
regions.

It is thought that when this material is collected arrangements
for publication may be made without cost to the catalogue organiza-
tion and even that, through such a published list, some financial
benefit to the International Catalogue may be derived, but failing
in this the labor involved would be justified on account of the need
for the current list by the catalogue organization as soon as publica-
tion is resumed.

In whatever form bibliographic aid is furnished the method of
preparation is the same. In all cases the original publications must
be first collected whether they are to be catalogued, indexed, classi-
fied, or abstracted, and regular and systematic means must exist to
gather all publications, not only periodicals but also single issues. °
The regional bureaus collectively have advantages in this respect
never before available to bibliographers and practically all of the
- world’s scientific literature is through them available. As the
catalogue organization was at the London conference of 1920 di-
rected to cooperate with abstracting journals and other similar
agencies, it is felt that, although the organization has been disap-
pointed in not yet being able to resume publication, it would be
justified in extending its aid to other publishing agencies by fur-
nishing citations to scientific publications being catalogued by the
regional bureaus. In return for such aid the catalogue would be
benefited by having available abstracts prepared by experts, thus
simplifying the work of classification. A final ideal combined
organization would, through international cooperation, produce all
bibliographic publications of whatever type, and it is felt that when
close cooperation is once established between all agencies having
kindred aims it will prove essential for their mutual benefit to
merge these enterprises into one organization. This plan should aim
to eventually include not only the literature of science but also that
of related technical industries whose existence and advance depend
on the progress made in pure science.

It is realized that to carry out these plans a very extensive organi-
zation would be necessary, but when the many great interests in-
volved and their evident unfilled needs are taken into consideration
it becomes apparent that some definite effort should be made to
consolidate the numerous independent agencies to the end that all
112 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

may be benefited. By combined effort much duplication of labor
and cost would be saved, and most important of all, bibliographers,
students, and industrial agencies would be furnished with prompt
and authoritative information regarding the literature of the sub-
jects relating to their several interests.

Very respectfully yours,

Leonarp C, GuNNELL,
Assistant in Charge.
Dr. Cuartes D. Watcort,
Secretary, Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX 9.
REPORT ON THE LIBRARY.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the activ-
ities of the library of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal
year ended June 30, 1922. f

Possessing more than a million volumes, pamphlets, manuscripts,
and charts, acquired chiefly in exchange, the library has continued
its steady, ever-increasing growth. There are now, according to the
records, 888,128 publications deposited at the Library of Congress
and 156,275 belonging to the United States National Museum. Books
belonging to other branches of the Institution have been estimated at
35,000.

Its volumes are being constantly borrowed and consulted within
the buildings. Interlibrary loans to accredited libraries, where
distance permits, are being continued, and in a number of instances
arrangements have been made for the photostating of pages from
rare volumes not permitted to leave the buildings.

Each day typewritten lists of original scientific articles appearing
in periodicals received for the Smithsonian deposit in the Library
of Congress are prepared and sent to heads of scientific bureaus
under the Institution for their information and for circulation.
These daily bibliographical lists, begun last November at the re-
quest of the secretary, Dr. Charles D. Walcott, have been well re-
ceived -from the start. Requests from other Government bureaus
and research organizations have been made for copies, which it has
not been possible to supply.

The facilities of the library have been taxed to the utmost since
the beginning of the war for information on various technical sub-
jects. Especially has this been so in connection with aeronautics.
In this one subject alone it is safe to say that the Institution, as
one ot the sources, has been the means of saving the United States
Government many thousands of dollars which would have had to
be paid if the information relating to the prior art had not been
analyzed and available.

SMITHSONIAN MAIN LIBRARY.

As most noteworthy among the accessions of the main library
might be mentioned copies of the @dttingische Gelehrie Anzeigen
for 1758, 1760, 1808, 1813, and 1814, the gift of the Gesellschaft fir

113
114 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

Wissenschaften zu Gottingen, and the Transactions of the Royal
Dublin Society for 1803 to 1810, the gift of that society.

Material published in oriental languages, while it is not yet
received in large quantities as compared with European publica-
tions, is continuing to increase, and it is hoped that in the future
the Institution may have in the collections at the Library of Con-
gress the most representative collection of this material that can
be brought together in this country. The furnishing of English
transliterations by the donors, as is done by the Vajiranafia Na-
tional Library, Bangkok, is of great assistance.

In order that material received for the library may be made
available to the public at the earliest possible moment, publica-
tions have been transmitted daily, as in years past, to the Smith-
sonian deposit in the Library of Congress. The number of publi-
cations so transmitted during the year was 8,907, consisting of 7,502
complete volumes, 800 parts of volumes, 376 pamphlets, and 229
charts. The accession numbers extended from 587,230 to 539,988.
The number of publications transmitted without being entered or
accessioned, including Government documents, was 7,213.

Cataloguing.—While the record for volumes catalogued has again
been surpassed, it has not been possible during the year to cata-
logue the remainder of the large accumulation of theses sent during
the war from European universities. Foliowing are the year’s
records:

OFFICE LIBRARY.

The growth and increasing value of the office library is perhaps
not fully realized. The total number of its accessions as reached
this year now numbers 27,100, of which 394 volumes were added
during the year. It consists of the following collections: Aero-
nautical, art room, De Peyster, deposited collections, employees’
library, periodicals (back numbers), reading room, reference room.

The aeronautical collection, founded by Samuel Pierpont Langley
while Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, has been since
augmented by gifts from Alexander Graham Bell, James Means,
Charles D. Walcott, the Aero Club of America, and other indi-
viduals and organizations that have had an important part in the
development of aeronautics during its pioneer stage. During the
present year some 45 volumes were added from the estate of James
Means, by gift of his sons Dr. James H. Means and Philip Ains-
worth Means.

By the transfer of the employees’ library to the east stacks in
the main hall of the Smithsonian building, it has been rendered more
readily accessible to employees, and additional space for its ex-
pansion has been provided. The collection of back numbers of
periodicals has been moved to the west stacks.

While the office library is primarily a reference library and books
are more often consulted than borrowed, many of the volumes are
available for loan purposes, and many employees of the Institution
avail themselves of its privileges. The total number of loans for
the year was 3,330.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY LIBRARY.

Loans from the Astrophysical Observatory Library are made
through the office library, and are included in the records of loans
from that library. During the year 79 volumes, 26 parts, and 40
pamphlets were added, and 53 volumes sent to the bindery. The
library is primarily a reference library for the use of the staff of
the Astrophysical Observatory.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY LIBRARY.

The report of operations of the library of the Bureau of Ethnology
will be found in the report of the chief of that bureau. It is admin-
istered directly under his care.

UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM LIBRARY.

The facilities of the Museum Library have been taxed as never
before. The number of books loaned was 10,886, and as many more
were consulted without being taken from the library.
116 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

Valuable material has been donated as in preceding years by
friends and members of the staff of the United States National
Museum. Among the donors are Messrs. H. S. Barber, August
Busck, Austin H. Clark, W. H. Dall, H. G. Dyar, O. P. Hay, Walter
Hough, W. R. Maxon, E. G. Mitchell, C. W. Richmond, J. H. Riley,
S, A. Rohwer, W. S. Schaus, B. H. Swales, and Dr. and Mrs. Charles
D, Walcott. Especially noteworthy are the gifts of Doctor Walcott
to the geological and paleontological collections, and the gifts of
Dr. William H. Dall to the section of the division of mollusks, num-
bering 233 titles.

Many of these collections have been received and they have an inti-
mate relation to the library in that the donors were connected with
the Museum and brought the collection together during the progress
of their researches. The list of donors in the foregoing paragraph
will give some idea of the number of collections of this kind that
have been added. Special attention should be called to the Iddings
and Walcott collections, given during the previous year. These
required assorting, arranging, and checking with other publications
of the same kind on the shelves, in order to prevent duplication, for
which there is not enough room at the present time.

SECTIONAL LIBRARIES.

In order that the volumes and publications of the Museum Library
may be readily accessible to the members of the administrative
and scientific staff of the Museum, 35 sectional libraries are main-
tained, namely :

Administration. Minerals.
Administrative assistant’s office. Mineral technology.
American archeology. Mollusks.
Anthropology. Old-world archeology.
Birds. Paleobotany.

Botany. Photography.

Hditor’s office. Physical anthropology.
Fishes. Property clerk’s office.
Foods. Registrar’s office.
Geology. Reptiles and batrachians.
Graphic arts, Superintendent’s office.
History. Taxidermy.
Invertebrate paleontology. Textiles.

The general library of the Museum is located in the Natural
History Building. In order that reference facilities may be readily
available to divisions of the Museum located in other buildings, the
technological library is maintained in the Arts and Industries Build-
ing, and the office library in the Smithsonian Building is at the dis-
posal of Museum divisions located there.

TECHNOLOGICAL LIBRARY.

The technological library, located in the old Museum Building, is
continuing the reorganization and rearrangement of its material.
The number of loans made during the fiscal year ended was 220.
Statistics of the scientific depository catalogue are not at present
available, owing to repairs and remodeling now in progress in the
library’s quarters.

NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY.

Records of the library of the National Gallery of Art are at pres-
ent kept in the Natural History Library of the Museum, and period-
icals entered upon the records and included in periodical statistics

118 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

of that library. Accessions for the fiscal year, exclusive of period-
icals, covered 32 volumes and 36 pamphlets.

FREER GALLERY OF ART LIBRARY.

Additions to the library of the Freer Gallery of Art during the
year numbered 14 volumes. The number of volumes now in the
library, exclusive of deposited books, is 127. A number of volumes
relating to art have been deposited by the Smithsonian Institution
in the Freer Building for use in connection with the collections,
among them the set of Serindia, by Sir Aurel Stein, comprising five
large quarto volumes with plates in color, presented by the Secre-
tary of State for India.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK LIBRARY.

Since the establishment of a library at the National Zoological
Park in 1905, there have been 378 accessions. The number during
the fiscal year ended was 15, comprising reports of kindred zoological
gardens and parks, and leading zoological works issued during the

year.
SUMMARY OF ACCESSIONS.
The accessions for the year, including parts to complete sets, with
the exception of additions to the library of the Bureau of American
Ethnology, may be summarized as follows:

All payments are made by check, signed by the secretary of the
institution, on the Treasurer of the United States, and all revenues
are deposited to the credit of the same account, except in some in-
stances small deposits are placed in bank for convenience of collec-
tion and later are withdrawn in round amounts and deposited in the
Treasury.

The practice of investing temporarily idle funds in time deposits
has proven highly satisfactory. During the year the interest derived
from this source, together with other similar items, has resulted in a
total of $2,033.93.

The following appropriations were intrusted by Congress to the
care of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year 1922:

PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF THE SMITH-
SONIAN INSTITUTION FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDING JUNE
30, 1922.

ANNUAL MEETING, DECEMBER 8, 1921.

Present: The Hon. Calvin Coolidge, Vice President of the United
States, chancellor, in the chair; Chief Justice William H. Taft; Sen-
ator A. Owsley Stanley; Representative Frank L. Greene; Repre-
sentative John A. Elston; Dr. A. Graham Bell; Hon. George Gray;
Mr. John B. Henderson; Hon. Henry White; Mr. Robert S. Brook-
ings; and the secretary, Mr. Charles D. Walcott.

NEW REGENT.

The secretary stated that the organic act establishing the Smith-
sonian Institution provides that the Chief Justice of the United
States shall be ex officio a regent of the institution. He had the
pleasure, therefore, of announcing that Hon. William Howard Taft
was now a member of the board.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF RESOLUTIONS.

The secretary read the following letter from Mrs. Edward Doug-
lass White:
JUNE 2, 1921.
My Drar Mr. Watcott: May I not ask you to convey to the Board of Regents
my sincere thanks and grateful appreciation of the generous tribute to my be-
loved husband, expressed in their resolutions, a copy of which you were so kind
as to send me.
Permit me also to thank you personally for the kind sympathy conveyed by
your letter of transmittal. ,
Very sincerely,
Mrs. Epwarp Dovuctass WHITE.

RESOLUTION RELATIVE TO INCOME AND EXPENDITURE.

Judge Gray, chairman of the executive committee, offered the fol-
lowing resolution, which was adopted:

Resolved, That the income of the institution for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1923, be appropriated for the service of the institution, to be expended by the
secretary with the advice of the executive committee, with full discretion on the
part of the secretary as to items.

132 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE.

The secretary presented, in printed form, the annual report of the
executive committee, giving a statement of the financial condition of
the institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1921.

On motion, the report was accepted.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE PERMANENT COMMITTEE.

At the request of Judge Gray the secretary submitted the follow-
ing report:

Hodgkins fund—Researches in solar radiation are being continued at the
station on the Montezuma Mountain, in Chile, at an altitude of between 9,000
and 10,000 feet. As stated in previous reports, the expense of the maintenance
of this station is borne chiefly from an allotment of $5,000 annually from
the Hodgkins special fund. The work is under the direction of Dr. Charles
G. Abbot, assistant secretary of the institution and director of the Astrophysical
Observatory.

Roebling contributions—Mr. John A. Roebling, of New Jersey, has gen-
erously contributed to date the sum of $29,150 in connection with certain
phases of the work of the solar research stations in Chile and Arizona. Sufficient
funds have been thus provided for the year, and good progress has been made
in the work.

Freer estate.—

Other provisions: Mr. Freer’s bequest to the institution provides certain
shares of stock for specified funds to the extent of $353,004.75. Of the residuary
estate there have been received $900,000, the income of which will not be
available for the purchase of additions to the collections for several years.

Avery bequest.—The total amount of this bequest is now $33,424.80. One
piece of improved real estate, situated on East Capitol Street, remains unsold.

Poore bequest.—Several pieces of land remain, but will be sold as favorable
offers are received. According to the terms of the will of the testator, George W.
Poore, this fund must accumulate until it reaches a total of $250,000. It now
amounts to $34,230.

Virginia Purdy Bacon bequest—This bequest, which will probably total
$50,000, was given to establish the Walter Rathbone Bacon (traveling) scholar-
ship for the study of the fauna of countries other than the United States.
Forty-five thousand dollars has been transferred to the institution in the
form of bonds and preferred stock of excellent value and stability.

Bruce Hughes bequest.—This fund, which was given for the purpose of estab-
lishing the Hughes alcove, now totals $11,170.99.

Frances Lea Chamberlain funds.—Two bequests were made by Dr. Leander T.
Chamberlain as a memorial to his wife, Frances Lea. One of these, of $10,000,
was received in 1915, and the other, of $25,000, in June, 1921. The income from
these funds is to be expended in the improvement and increase of the Isaac Lea
collections of “ Mollusks” and of “Gems and gem material” now in the
National Museum.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE REGENTS. 133

Addison T. Reid bequest.—This bequest, which is to found a chair in biology
as a memorial to the testator’s grandfather, Asher Tunis, now amounts to
$14,260. The bequest was subject to the condition that the income was to be
paid in three shares to certain named beneficiaries until their death, when the
principal of each share, with accumulations, was to come to the institution.
Two of these beneficiaries have died, and their shares have been received. The
remaining share represents approximately $5,000.

Miscellaneous bequests—A number of small bequests, aggregating several
thousand dollars, have been included in the consolidated fund.

Residual bequests.—The institution will receive the following bequests, sub-
ject to the death of certain beneficiaries: The Joseph White Sprague bequest;
the Lucy Hunter Baird bequest; the Riter Fitzgerald bequest; and the Caroline
Henry bequest. From the last named estate an additional cash bequest of
$1,000 has been received.

Consolidated fund.—This is composed of funds received in excess of the
$1,000,000 deposited in the Treasury of the United States under the authority
of the organic act. It includes several of the bequests referred to above, and
now amounts to $157,562.05.

Mr. Henderson offered the following resolution, which was adopted :

Resolved, That the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution accepts
the report of the permanent committee and approves and ratifies the actions
taken by the committee since the last annual meeting of the board.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The secretary submitted, with explanatory remarks, his report
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1921, printed copies of which had
already been supplied the regents.

On motion, the report was accepted.

ANNUAL REPORT OF THE NATIONAL GALLERY OF ART COMMISSION.

At a meeting held May 27, 1921, the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution established a National Gallery of Art Com-
mission, to consist of five public men interested in the fine arts, five
experts in the fine arts, five artists, and the Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution ex officio. The primary purpose of the commis-
sion is to promote the administration, development, and utilization
of the National Gallery of Art, including the acquisition of material
of high quality representing the fine arts, and the study of the best
methods of exhibiting art works to the public and their utilization
for instruction.

The commission has held several meetings, at the first of which
officers were elected and the various committees called for in the plan
of organization appointed. The details of the membership of the
commission and of its committees, and also of the business transacted
during the year, will be found in the appendix on the National Gal-
lery of Art in the annual report of the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution for the year ending June 30, 1922.

On motion, the report was accepted.

55379—24—10
134 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

The secretary reported the resignation of Mr. Charles A. Platt
as a member of the commission, and stated that Mr. A. Kingsley
Porter had been suggested to fill the vacancy. On nomination he was
elected.

FREER ESTATE MATTERS.

The secretary said that he had already called attention to the
financial condition of the Freer bequest and funds as detailed in the
permanent committee’s report. The board was aware that the State
of Michigan had levied a State inheritance tax against the residuary
estate of Mr. Freer. This tax, which was considerably more than
$400,000, was also subject to a penalty tax, so that the total amount
was probably as much as $480,000.

The executors were anxious to settle the estate and had suggested
a plan which would save as much of the residuary portion as pos-
sible for the institution. This plan had been taken up by the per-
manent committee, and after careful consideration the method of
settlement had been outlined in a series of resolutions which were
submitted in detail to the board.

After discussion, the resolutions were adopted.

ZOOLOGICAL PARK APPROPRIATION.

The secretary said that in the alternative budget the appropria-
tion for the National Zoological Park has been taken from among
the Smithsonian branches, and has been included among the appro-
priations for the District of Columbia, for the reason, as stated,
that 60 per cent of the appropriation for the park is charged against
the revenue of the District.

The transferring of this appropriation to the District bill would
not necessarily make any change in the administration of the park,
which, in the act. of organization, is specifically placed under the
direction of the Board of Regents, the appropriations therefor to
be disbursed by the disbursing officer of the institution. It might,
however, give rise to misunderstandings and difficulties in its prac-
tical administration.

The secretary added that he was not asking action on the part
of the board at this time.

THE SECRETARY’S SUPPLEMENTAL STATEMENT.

The secretary presented a supplemental statement covering the
various activities of the institution since the printing of the annual
report. These will be described in detail in his printed report for
1922.
GHNERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1922

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the Genrrat Appenprx to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific dis-
covery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by
collaborators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character
or on special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous
correspondents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the
Smithsonian Institution from a very early date to enrich the annual
report required of them by Jaw with memoirs illustrating the more
remarkable and important developments in physical and biological
discovery, as well as showing the general character of the operations
of the Institution; and, during the greater part of its history, this
purpose has been carried out largely by the publication of such papers
as would possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880, induced in part by the discontinuance of an annual sum-
mary of progress which for 30 years previous had been issued by
well-known private publishing firms, the secretary had a series of
abstracts prepared by competent collaborators, showing concisely the
prominent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geol-
ogy, meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology,
and anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not alto-
gether satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report for 1922.

WHO WILL PROMOTE SCIENCE?

By C. G. ABgoT.

President Harding, in transmitting the annual Federal budget to
Congress, on December 4, 1922, proposed a budget of approximately
three billion dollars for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1924. Of this
sum, he pointed out that two-thirds were necessary on account of
practically fixed charges, such as the public debt, national defense,
pensions, World War allowances, Federal aid, and there was left
about one billion dollars in charges subject to administrative control.
Analyzing these latter charges, he at length came to the item
$10,619,456 for science and research and a little after took up the
question of further cuts in Government appropriations, saying:

Can there be a reasonable expectation for further considerable reduction in
governmental expenditures in the near future? This question is no doubt upon
the lips of many. The burden of taxation caused by the World War has borne
heavily upon us all, and it has been the earnest desire of the Government to
reduce this burden to the minimum consistent with a proper functioning of the
Federal services. We have seen, however, that approximately two-thirds of
the taxes collected go to pay certain fixed charges, over the expenditure of
which there can be exercised little or no administrative control * * *.

After deducting these items there is left, as has been shown, approximately
only one billion dollars, out of which these normal operating expenses of the
Government must be paid. It is against this group of expenditures that the
retrenchment policy of the Government has been directed.

After discussing some of the items included in this category, he
continues :

There is * * * a rapidly broadening field of Government expenditure
which may be discussed with profit to us all. I refer to expenditures which
are being made from appropriations for Federal aid in lines of research, im-
provement, and development, which, while having no direct connection with the
operations of the business of Government, have grown to become a recognized
part of its activities * * *, There is question as to how far the Govern-
ment should participate in these extraneous activities, and I am frank to say
that an answer to the question as to whether we can look forward to any fur-
ther material reduction in the expenditures of the Government in future years
depends largely upon whether or not there will be a curtailment or expansion
of these activities, which have already added greatly to the annual drafts
upon the Treasury of the United States.

137
138 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

From these authoritative figures we learn that the Federal Gov-
ernment is appropriating one-third of 1 per cent of its annual budget
for science and research, and that in the pursuit of economy it may he
possible that this and other public welfare items, regarded as extra-
neous to the true business of Government, may be subject to future
reduction. This raises the question: Should science be supported at
all; and if so, by whom?

People fall in several classes according to their outlook upon
science. There are those who hold that because “A little knowledge
is a dangerous thing” a great deal of knowledge is a calamity. Over
against this is the little group of those who love knowledge for its
own sake as the soul of civilization and a great prize worth sacrifice
to gain. Between these extremes lies the great body of the public
whose first question about a new discovery is “ What good is it?”

If it were possible to change this attitude of the man in the street
to that of faith in the future value of all truth, such as indeed past
experience warrants, there would remain no reason to write this
article. Government would then support research by more than
one-third of 1 per cent of its budget, because the voters would demand
it, and men of wealth would increasingly bequeath new foundations
for scientific research or strengthen existing ones.

It is a pity that the man who loves and creates knowledge should
be so remote from the man who creates wealth. The press of our
country does little to bridge the chasm between the man of science
and the public, not because the papers are not eager to print every
new thing—far from it. But, unlike the press of many foreign coun-
tries, and notably of the British Australasian colonies, our writers
place small value on accuracy and appear by comparison with Aus-
tralian reporters to belittle the intelligence and good taste of their
readers. Few news reporters of the United States are qualified them-
selves to write on science, but when interviewing a research man on
the subject of his latest discovery they seldom use shorthand. They
take a few notes in a longhand code, but their prime object is to pry
for something sensational to associate with the story. When the
piece appears the sensation is the kite, the discovery no more than
a mutilated tail. The discoverer shudders and vows it shall be the
last interview he will grant. His fellow investigators, seeing the
news story, may make a shrewd guess as to what he has done, but
the public, with little knowledge of the subject as a guide, is led ever
deeper into the Alice in Wonderland world which our newspapers
invent. There are some gallant exceptions in the American press.
More power to them! §

Doubtless the blame should alight partly upon the man of science.
For if he will not or ean not present his news in an interesting way
WHO WILL PROMOTE SCIENCE?——-ABBOT., 139

the reporters will do it for him, accuracy to the contrary notwith-
standing, if they can scent out any whiff of human interest in it.
In good conscience it behooves him to practice up in the art of pre-
senting the heart of things. Even his fellow men of science would
appreciate that when it comes to listening to him in a meeting.

There is a time-worn illustration which strikes harder now than
when first uttered, because the faith of the man of science has been
so overwhelmingly justified. A member of the Government to whom
Michael Faraday was showing a new experiment in electricity said
slightingly, “ Very curious, but of what use is it?” “By and by,
my lord,” replied Faraday, “ you may tax it.”

Not everybody who makes valuable discoveries is a Faraday, yet
the man in the street expects every discoverer to be also a prophet,
and not only a prophet, but endowed with a gift of tongues, so that
when asked “ of what use is the new result? ” he shall go beyond the
answer of him who replied: “ Of what use, madame, is a new-born
infant?” and be able to describe the whole family tree of the de-
scendants of the infant discovery in terms so simple and so clear that
he who runs may read.

If investigation had always been limited to subjects promising to
have utility, we should still be in the dark ages. The enlightenment
of the human mind brought about by the study of astronomy, for
instance, has a value not to be measured by dollars and cents, but
by the safety of life and property from religious persecution and
by the advance from superstition and ignorant fear of nature. On
the other hand, it would be easy to cite many investigations of ap-
parently merely curious and trivial phenomena which later on came
to have high commercial utility. One will suffice. Thirty years ago
no “ practical man” would have dreamed of investigating the con-
duction of electricity through rarefied gases. Riéntgen’s discovery
of X rays was not in the least influenced by utility, but came out of
pure research work in that field. Think of X-ray hospital work
nowadays! Moreover, every department store carries radio-tele-
phone outfits, with their thermionic amplifiers, which also are the
children of that same line of pure research.

But after all, “ what further need have we of witnesses?” Hert-
zian waves have become radio; Pasteur’s bacilli have led up to the
Mayo brothers’ surgery and the abolishment of yellow fever; Fara-
day’s and Henry’s electromagnets have become dynamos and tele-
graphs, and the whole world is revolutionized in a century by the
discoverers who worked not for utilities but for knowledge. Yet it
is a mean, stunted mind that sees only things like autos and electric
iights as the foremost rewards and justification of science. What
the sculpture of Phidias, the painting of Raphael, the music of
140 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

Beethoven, the language of the Bible, are to the finer departments of
the mind such also and quite as wholesome in their influence on pri-
vate life and public conduct are those studies of the atoms, the uni-
verse, and the march of life, which form science.

An investment in science is as sure as a United States bond. All
history, and especially the history of our own time, proves it. Ifa
man of millions coming up to the time when he should put his house
in order for his departure is so clannish as to wish to give all to his
heirs, caring nothing for any other living beings in this world and
not even regarding a monument to himself, he would accomplish his
purpose more completely by investing 5 per cent of his fortune to
promote scientific research. For his descendants will suffer cancers
and will desire luxuries like other men. The only way that those
pangs may be avoided and those desires gratified is by the making
and utilization of scientific discoveries. If means are provided, such
discoveries will be made and applied. The past proves it. No gift
of prophecy is needed to know that the future progress of knowledge
will benefit both rich and poor.

Science should be supported, but by whom, and to whom should
the wealth flow to promote it? President Harding’s message shows
that for the present Federal support is scanty, and for the future un-
certain. The State governments differ in their liberality, but on the
whole, like the Nation, so the States. There are the universities and
schools of higher learning whose scientific output is inspiring. But
listen to the general cry from them! Enormous enrollment, pinching
salaries, time and energy consumed in teaching. They can do little
more without endowments specifically given them for research pur-
poses. They can not devote more of their present means to scientific
experiments, though they might employ additional sums highly
creditably if such were intrusted to them. Then there are the great
manufacturing corporations. All the more enlightened of them main-
tain now scientific laboratories, but primarily they are carried on for
utilitarian ends closely associated with the problems of manufacture,
and the results are apt to be withheld in part from public knowledge.
One is not aware that a single one of these organizations promotes,
for example, the progress of mathematics, although all of them make
use of it as a tool, and without the progress of mathematics beyond
its present attainments the more profound engineering problems of
the future will lack means of solution.

In short, research with the universities, colleges, and corporations
is a secondary by-product, associated in the former with teaching,
in the latter with manufacturing. The professors may have the
spirit inclined to seek knowledge wherever it leads, but they lack the
opportunity. The corporation employees drive knowledge where
WHO WILL PROMOTE SCIENCE?—ABBOT. 141

wealth is to be gained. These agencies are not enough. There needs
to be the broad research organizations founded to survey the field
of knowledge, direct researches so as to fill its gaps and extend its
borders without prejudice in favor of immediate wealth-producing
utilities. They must also publish and diffuse accurate and inspiring
knowledge among the people and find out and give opportunities for
work to the exceptional men and women—the Faradays and the
Curies of the future.

There are already several such establishments well organized,
ably directed, and enjoying the advice and counsel of the most well-
informed and far-sighted of our men of science and philanthropy.
Men of wealth have founded them as memorials in most cases, giv-
ing their own names, very naturally, to secure perpetual remem-
brance. The time will come when it would be foolish and hurtful
to add to the number of such institutions, but not soon when it will
cease to be needful to add to their financial resources.

There should be no hesitation on account of a name. Some of
these institutions, notably the oldest, the Smithsonian, have carried
their names so long that they are now no longer primarily associated
with the founders, but rather with the noble work which the institu-
tions have done, so that they have become household and national
rather than family names. A modern giver to such an old institution
may, however, well require that his own name should be attached to
that part of the foundation which he donates, and thus he may pro-
vide himself with a worthy memorial.

But let him think seriously in doing so before tying up his gift
with restrictions as to the character of the expenditures to be pro-
moted thereby. The giver is but one man, and however wide his
knowledge that of the institution is wider, more comprehensive, and
discerning. 'Times change; research is alive and growing. Let there
be trust in the wisest use of the funds by the enlightened executive of
the institution rather than a restriction of scope. Otherwise the in-
stitution is apt to be loaded with a series of white elephants and op-
pressed to stagnation by the management of them, whereas if the
gifts were free from oppressive conditions the right things could be
done to promote useful knowledge.

Colleges have loyal alumni, some of great wealth competent to en-
dow large foundations bearing their names. But the alumni as a
body, without hope of individual perpetual remembrance give great
sums to rescue the college in its times of need. Research institutions
lack these loyal constituencies. How can they, then, with dignity
lay bare their poverty or hope for adequate relief? Can their officers,
so imbued with veneration and loyalty that they serve a lifetime for
a pittance, eked out by literary or teaching work in recreation hours,

confide their own straits, the paucity of research funds, the starva-
tion wages of the employees, and, as it might seem, ask alms of the
general world?

Really, the world owes research men a living. But the plain fact
is that they not only furnish the brains and the labor but a large
part of the money for the investigations which result in the utilities
that all enjoy. One could name leaders in all branches of knowledge
who piece out the living expenses of their families by pitiful out-
side jobs in order to be able to carry on their God-given tasks, when
they might use their exceptional ability and knowledge like others
to obtain princely incomes in the commercial world.

If any of our research institutions deserves public benefactions,
most of all it is the national Smithsonian Institution. Founded by
an Englishman, James Smithson, “ for the increase and diffusion of
knowledge among men,” it has been the parent of the Weather Bu-
reau, the Fish Commission, the National Museum, the Bureau of
American Ethnology, the Geological Survey, the National Zoo-
logical Park, the Astrophysical Observatory, the Bureau of Interna-
tional Exchanges (of scientific intelligence), and the National Gal-
lery of Art; has contributed largely to the Library of Congress; and
has had a part in many other valuable enterprises. In its reports
and technical papers the inquirer may find in accurate form, some-
times popularly, sometimes technically expressed, the whole progress
of human knowledge. Not only that, but in a daily correspondence
which taxes its small force of experts and clerks, it has answered
millions of inquiries for useful or technical information. Though
some of the bureaus just named have split away from the parent or-
ganization, the Institution is still charged by Congress with the care
of eight of them. These administrative duties employ much time of
the staff and in some measure prevent the promotion of projects for
the advancement of science.

But, really, the Smithsonian Institution can not take a leading
place in scientific research any longer because of its poverty. The
present income from the endowment is only about $70,000 per annum.
The Carnegie Institution and the Rockefeller Foundation each have
more income than this every fortnight, and several other research
institutions are almost in their class. Salaries at the Smithsonian
Institution are on the scale of the year 1880. Young investigators
of promise can not be secured to supplement and succeed those grown
gray in service. No large projects can be undertaken. Even publi-
cation is restricted.

Surely if this were known generally a feeling of national pride
would refuse to permit this great Institution associated with the re-
searches of its famous secretaries, Joseph Henry, Spencer F. Baird,
Samuel P. Langley, and Charles D. Walcott, to continue to languish.
WHO WILL PROMOTE SCIENCE?—ABBOT. 143

Research has enhanced the Nation’s strength and glory. Let it be
fostered as it deserves. People of great wealth may do this in a
large way without strain, and yet provide liberally for their heirs.
Or great numbers of people of moderate means may share the enter-
prise, in full confidence that the outcome will help the world of the
future to a richer life.

What would the Smithsonian Institution do if it had a large
endowment ?

1. Draw to itself the wisest counselors, and fix, with their concur-
rence, on the most needful projects, not being worked by others, and
manageable with its endowment.

2. Pay sufficient salaries to its staff so that it could justly com-
mand all their time.

3. Procure young investigators of promise.

4. Broaden its output of publication.

If an illustration of what this might accomplish is demanded,
consider the record of the Carnegie Institution. Founded 20 years
ago, it set up eight principal projects, namely: The Mount Wilson
Solar Observatory; the Department of Meridian Astrometry; the
Department of Terrestrial Magnetism; the Geophysical Laboratory;
the Laboratory of Experimental Evolution; the Marine Biological
Laboratory at Tortugas; the Desert Botanical Laboratory at Tucson;
the Nutrition Laboratory at Boston. In each case the director was
a man with a passionate zeal for his job, and a sound program for
its accomplishment. Subordinates hardly less zealous and competent
were employed. The results have been so rich that if the accom-
plishments and the very remembrance of the work of these eight
Carnegie Institution departments were now to be blotted out, our
total knowledge of astronomy would be cut in half, the magnetic
charts of the sea would be unfit for navigation, the United States
Army and Navy would have wanted unobtainable essentials in the
World War, sociology, biology, botany, and the science of nutrition
would have lacked many of their most valuable data. Besides this
there has been in these 20 years a rich flow of publications too costly
for the private publisher to undertake, and many great pieces of
research by exceptional investigators outside the Institution have
been subsidized. Such is the record of a well-endowed research
institution. Such ought to be made possible as the record for the
next 20 years of the national Smithsonian Institution.

RECENT DISCOVERIES AND THEORIES RELATING TO
THE STRUCTURE OF MATTER.’

By Kart TAyLor Compton,

Professor of Physics in Princeton University.

Molecules of matter are sometimes defined as the smallest sub-
divisions which have the properties of the matter which they com-
pose. Their existence has long been accepted because of the satis-
factory explanation which they give of elastic, thermal, and other
properties of matter, particularly in the gaseous state. More re-
cently the existence of such particles in rapid random motion has
been made almost visible in that we can accurately explain, by the
bombardment of such molecules, the erratic, jerky movements made
by a small particle immersed in a gas or liquid and observed through
a microscope.

Atoms are sometimes defined as the smallest particles which take
part in chemical reactions, and a chemical reaction is simply a
change from one to another kind of grouping made by atoms of the
same or of different kinds. Any characteristic grouping of atoms
constitutes a molecule. The existence of atoms was first suggested
to explain the fact of chemical combination of substances in definite
proportions.

Within the last 25 years, and chiefly within the last 10 years,
definite proof of the existence of atoms and molecules has been found
and methods have been developed to count and weigh them indi-
vidually, with very significant results. More important still, it has
been shown that all atoms are themselves built out of still smaller
and more fundamental units of matter, electrically charged, called
positive electrons and negative electrons. There is very decisive
evidence of the existence of these two fundamental types of matter
and of the number of each type in any given kind of atom. To this
extent the “electron theory of matter” is no longer to be considered

as a theory but as a fact. But when we attempt to explain all the
physical and chemical properties of matter as due to these electrons
and the electromagnetic forces between them we encounter some sur-
prising and unexpected facts regarding the behavior of electrons
when influenced by other electrons or by radiation, so that this is
still a field of hypothesis and experimentation.

NEGATIVE AND POSITIVE ELECTRONS.

Properties of the negative electron—When an electric discharge
at several thousand volts is passed between two metallic electrodes
sealed into a glass vessel from which most of the air or other gas
has been pumped, the remaining gas and the walls of the glass vessel
become luminous. This luminosity is of different sorts in different
parts of the vessel and can easily be shown to be due to two different
agents. One of these consists of something shooting out from the
cathode, or negative electrode, and producing luminosity in every-
thing in its path. The other consists of something shooting out from
the anode and moving toward the cathode, also producing luminosity
of gas molecules or other objects in its path, but luminosity of a
different color from that produced by the stream from the cathode.

The so-called cathode rays are found to consist of a stream of
negatively charged particles, as is proved by the fact that their
paths are bent if placed in an electric or magnetic field, or by the
fact that if they are caught in a metallic cup, this cup receives a
charge of negative electricity. From the amount of bending in elec-
tric and magnetic fields of known strength, which may be seen by
the luminous trace of the path of the stream along a properly placed
fluorescent plate, it is possible to calculate the speed of the particles
and the ratio of their charge to their mass, denoted by e/m. The
speed of the particles depends upon the voltage applied to the dis-
charge tube, but the value of e/m does not depend on the voltage
or the kind of gas in the vessel or the material of the electrodes.
It is a definite constant about 1,846 times larger than the ratio of
the charge to the mass of hydrogen ions liberated by electrolysis.
Thus, if the charge on one of these particles is equal to the charge
on a hydrogen ion (as we shall see is the case), then these particles
must be 1,846 times lighter than hydrogen atoms. These particles,
which constitute the cathode rays, are the negative electrons. They
may be driven out of metals by raising the temperature or by ex-
posing to ultra-violet light or X rays, or by intense bombardment,
or by chemical actions, etc. Their properties, as regards mass and
charge, are the same however they are liberated and they must be
considered as one of the fundamental units of which matter is com-
posed.
STRUCTURE OF MATTER—COMPTON. 147

The anode rays are also deflected by magnetic and electric fields in
a direction showing that they are positively charged particles and by
an amount showing that the ratio of their charge to mass is char-
acteristic of atoms or molecules of the gas in the tube. In other
words, they are the residues of the gas atoms or molecules which
remain after electrons have been driven out. Knowing their charges,
the bending of their paths in magnetic and electric fields enables
their masses to be determined. It is in this manner that atoms and
molecules have been individually weighed with high precision.

In order to find the mass m from the above values of e/m, it is
necessary to know the charge e of a negative electron. This has been
measured with the greatest accuracy by Professor Millikan about
eight years ago. The most sensitive instrument for measurement of
electric charges is the electroscope, which consists, essentially, of a
strip of gold leaf suspended between two oppositely charged metal
plates. When the gold leaf is charged it is attracted by one plate
and repelled by the other, and the size of its charge may be measured
by observing the distance which it moves from its uncharged position.
But this instrument is not sensitive enough to measure the charge
of an electron. Professor Millikan substituted for the gold leaf a
tiny droplet of oil from the spray of an atomizer. Because of its
weight it tended to fall through the air slowly, because of its small
size and the viscous resistance offered by the air; but if this droplet
were electrically charged, it could be drawn upward, in opposition to
gravity, by an electric field between the two horizontal metal plates
between which the droplet moved. By observing through a telescope
the rate at which the drop fell in the absence of an electric field and
the rate at which it rose in the field, data were obtained permitting
a calculation of the amount of electric charge on the drop. It was
found that all charges were simple multiples of a fundamental unit
charge, which is the charge of an electron. Thus the negative elec-
tron is not only a fundamental unit of matter but also a fundamental
unit of electricity.

By such experiments it is found that the mass of a negative elec-
tron is 8.97(10)-** grams and its charge is 4.774(10)-*° electrostatic
units. The mass of a hydrogen atom is 1.65(10)-** grams.

Positive electrons—When the positively charged residue of an
atom, the part left after the loss of an electron, is weighed by meas-
uring the bending of its path in an electric and magnetic field, two
very significant results are obtained. In the first place, the weight
of every atom, except hydrogen, is an exact integral multiple of the
weight of a fundamental unit. This unit is one-fourth the weight
of a helium atom, or one-twelfth that of a carbon atom, or one-
sixteenth that of an oxygen atom, etc. The unit has almost the
weight of a hydrogen atom, but is less by 0.77%. ‘This discrep-

ancy is accounted for by the fact, discussed later, that when elec-
trically charged particles are grouped together their combined mass
differs slightly from the sum of their separate masses. We may con-
clude, therefore, that all atoms are built up of hydrogen atoms. We
shall see later that the hydrogen atom itself consists of one negative
electron and the part that remains, which is called the positive elec-
tron. The positive electron carries an electric charge equal to that of
a negative electron, but of opposite sign, and is 1,846 times heavier.
Thus we go a step further and conclude that all atoms are built up
of positive and negative electrons.

Why was not this simple integral relationship between atomic
weights discovered long ago, since chemists have accurately known
atomic weights for many years? Simply because chemical methods
of determining atomic weights measure only the average weight of a
great number of atoms, but the method described above measures the
weights of individual atoms. In the case of the element chlorine, for
instance, the chemical determinations give the weight equal to 35.46
times our unit, but the deflection method shows that there are three
different kinds of chlorine atoms, of weights exactly 35, 37, and 39,
which are chemically inseparable and which are present in such rela-
tive proportions as to make the average atomic weight 35.46. These
different kinds of chemically similar atoms, with different masses, are
called isotopes. It has been found that isotopes exist in a large
number of the chemical elements, but that the weight of every indi-
vidual atom or isotope is an exact multiple of that of the funda-
mental unit.

If positive electrons, or the massive part of hydrogen atoms, are
parts of the structure of all atoms, we might expect to be able to
break up heavier atoms into hydrogen. This has actually been done
by Professor Rutherford in the case of nitrogen, aluminium, and a
number of other elements.

HOW ELECTRONS ARE ARRANGED IN ATOMS.

Thus we have both direct and indirect evidence that atoms are
structures built out of positive and negative electrons. The next
question is, “ How are these electrons arranged in the various atoms? ”
A good deal is known about this arrangement, as I shall proceed to
indicate, but there is much more which is still unknown.

The nuclear structure of atoms.—Radium and the other radio-
active elements owe their unusual properties to the fact that they
emit positively and negatively charged particles, called a and @
particles, respectively, with tremendous velocities. By the bending
of their paths in electric and magnetic fields, or by other methods, it
is found that the @ particles are negative electrons which have veloci-
ties as large as 97 per cent of the velocity of light, or about 180,000
STRUCTURE OF MATTER—COMPTON. 149

miles per second. Similarly, the « particles are atoms of helium
which have lost two negative electrons and which consist, therefore,
of four positive and two negative electrons, forming a very com-
pact and stable group. These have velocities as large as about
one-tenth that of light. The 8 particles set up oscillations of nega-
tive electrons in neighboring atoms which they strike, and these oscil-
lations produce radiation called y radiation or wave motion in the
ether. The atoms of radium do not “explode” in this manner fre-
quently. In fact, the occurrence is so rare that the chances are even
that any given atom will or will not explode within a time of 2,000
years. When it does explode there remains not an atom of radium
(atomic weight 226), but an atom of radium emanation (atomic
weight 222) and an « particle (helium, atomic weight 4).

In spite of their smaller velocity, the « particles possess much
greater kinetic energy than do the @ particles, being nearly 7,400
times heavier. It was by means of bombardment of nitrogen and
other atoms by these « particles that Professor Rutherford has
effected their atomic disintegration, yielding hydrogen as a product.

When the « particles shoot out through a gas, such as air, their
paths may be seen and photographed, provided the air is saturated
with water vapor and suddenly cooled by expansion. The air mole-
cules in the path of the « particles have negative electrons forced
out of them by the action of the positively charged « particle as it
comes very close. These positively and negatively charged residues
of the air molecules serve as nuclei for the condensation of water
vapor. Thus the path of the a particle is visible as a thin line of
water droplets. In air at atmospheric pressure these paths may be
as long as 11 centimeters.

Now, the diameters of air molecules are known to be about 3(10)-°
em., and there are about 2.7(10)?® of them in each cubic centimeter.
An a particle, in traversing 11 cm. of air, would pass through about
200,000 molecules. Yet many «@ particles go this entire distance
without changing the direction of their motion, and most of them
go at least several centimeters without swerving from their course.
This can only mean that an « particle may pass right through thou-
sands of atoms without colliding with that part of an atom in which
practically all of its mass is situated. We must, therefore, think of
all of the positive electrons (and possibly some of the negative elec-
trons) of an atom as grouped within a region which is excessively
small as compared with the size of the atom. Around this compact
group, or “nucleus,” the remaining negative electrons are situated
at relatively large distances—distances comparable with the atomic
radius.

With all the heavy positive electrons and only some of the nega-
tive electrons constituting this nucleus, it is evidently positively

553879 —24——11
150 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

charged. An «@ particle is also positively charged, with a known
charge. Professor Rutherford suggested that a collision between
them, indicated by a sharp bend in the path of the « particle as it
passes through the air, may be due simply to the effect of the repul-
sive force between these two charges when they come very near to-
gether. Darwin calculated, on this hypothesis, the fraction of all
the observed deflections of « particles, shooting through air or any
other substance, which should be within any specified angular limits.
When this calculation was compared with the experimental measure-
ments of deflections through various angles, it was found that there
was exact agreement only provided the force between the « particle
and the nucleus is taken to vary inversely as the square of the dis-
tance between them, and provided the charge of the nucleus of the
atom is taken equal (in electronic units) to its atomic number. The
atomic number of an element is its order in the periodic table, i. e.,
1 for hydrogen, 2 for helium, 3 for lithium, etc.,

This conclusion was verified by an entirely independent method.
When a beam of X rays passes through substances, some of its
energy is abstracted and sent out in all directions. The amount,
character, and distribution of this scattered radiation have been ex-
actly accounted for by ascribing the scattering to the action of the
electrons outside the nuclei of the atoms. These electrons are ac-
celerated by the electric forces in the X-ray beam, and, as a result
of their acceleration, give rise to the scattered radiation. Sir J. J.
Thomson calculated the proportion of the energy of an X-ray beam
scattered by each negative electron in its path. Dividing the ob-
served amount of scattering by this gives the number of negative
electrons taking part in the scattering. Dividing this by the number
of atoms gives the number of scattering electrons per atom, which
is found equal to its atomic number. But the number of scattering
electrons (electrons outside the nucleus) must obviously equal the
positive charge of the nucleus, in electronic units, thus verifying the
previous conclusions regarding the nuclear charges of atoms.

Finally, a relation between the atomic number of an element and
the vibration frequency of the radiation constituting its X-ray spec-
trum was discovered by Moseley. It can be expressed rather accu-
rately by saying that the square root of the frequency of any par-
ticular type of X-radiation is directly proportional to the atomic
number of the radiating element. This has been satisfactorily ac-
counted for only by supposing that the atomic number of an element
is equal to the electronic charge on its nucleus, i. e., to the excess of
positive over negative electrons in its nucleus.

Atomic constituents—The foregoing evidence, and much addi-
tional evidence, leads to the conclusion that the various chemical
elements have atoms constituted as shown in the following table,
STRUCTURE OF MATTER—COMPTON. 151

which contains only a few examples. Those elements bracketed to-
gether are isotopes.

Thus far we may go with considerable certainty in our picture of
atomic structure. When we endeavor to learn how these electrons
are arranged, both within and without the nucleus, we must base
our conclusions on such evidence as we can get from the nature of
the chemical (electromagnetic) forces between atoms, from the
ways in which the atoms may be broken up or their parts set into
vibration, producing light or other radiation, from their behavior
in electric and magnetic fields, etc. To understand the structure
fully, we should know all about the forces which hold the parts to-
gether. In this direction some progress has been made but certain
phases of the problem are very perplexing.

ELECTRONS AND RADIATION.

Quantum theory.—Electromagnetic theory leads to the conclusion
that radiation is produced when an electric charge is accelerated, and
this conclusion has been amply verified. Yet it appears that, under
some conditions, electrons are accelerated without producing radia-
tion. Ordinary dynamical theory leads us to expect that a negative
electron, rotating or oscillating about a center of force, might rotate
in an orbit of any radius or oscillate with any amplitude under ap-
propriate conditions. Yet it appears that only certain particular
stable motions are possible, those which satisfy the condition
S p dqg=hs, where p is the momentum of the electron, g is its distance
from some reference point in its path, s is any integer such as
1, 2, 8, etc., and A is a universal constant, known as Planck’s con-
stant. We naturally think of radiant energy as being emitted con-
152 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN {NSTITUTION, 1922,

tinuously from its source and being absorbed continuously by mate-
rial in its path, these emitting and absorbing agents being known to
be electrons. Yet there is evidence that radiant energy is absorbed
or emitted as if in discrete units equal to hn, where n is the fre-
quency of vibration of the radiation.

Such considerations have given rise to the guantum theory, which
has been remarkably successful as a statement of the conditions
under which an electron will or will not radiate and of the condi-
tions under which it may be in equilibrium in an atom. Little
progress has, however, been made in explaining the quantum laws,
and, until this is done, it will probably be impossible fully to under-
stand the forces which hold the parts of atoms together.

Spectral series.—In the apparently complicated spectra of chemi-
cal elements, some of which contain hundreds of bright lines in the
visible spectrum alone, there have been discovered remarkable rela-
tionships between the frequencies of vibration of the different spec-
tral lines of an element and between corresponding lines of different
elements. These relationships may be expressed by series formulae,
of which the following formula for the vibration frequencies of the
various kinds of light, or spectral lines, due to hydrogen atoms is

an example:
Lival
n= Ns oe 33)

Here » is the number of vibrations per section, V is a universal con-
stant 3.29025(10)'® and v and m are integers which may have any
value between 1 and infinity. Thus, if 7 = 1 and m = 2, 3, 4,....,
each value of m gives a frequency corresponding to a spectral line in
the extreme ultraviolet. These lines constitute a spectral series.
Similarly if 7 = 2 and m = 3, 4, 5, ete., we get a series of lines in the
visible and near ultraviolet spectrum. If 7 = 8 and m = 4, 5, 6, ete.,
we get a series of lines in the infra red. The frequencies of these
lines agree with the measured frequencies with an accuracy of about
one part in a hundred thousand. |

For elements other than hydrogen, there are added to r and m
certain constants characteristic of the element, but 7 and m still take
various integral values.

A study of the absorption or refraction of light by a medium leads
to the possibility of calculating the number of atoms in the absorb-
ing substance which are, at any given instant, capable of emitting
light of any given frequency. By such methods we learn that only
a small fraction of the atoms are, at any instant, taking part in the
emission of light and that the atoms emitting one line in the spec-
trum are different from those emitting any other line. Thus an atom,
when it emits radiation, emits only one frequency of radiation at a
time.
STRUCTURE OF MATTER-——COMPTON. 1538

Zeeman effect.—Mention only can be made of the discovery by
Zeeman in 1896 that, when a source of light is placed in a strong
magnetic field, its spectral lines are split up into several components.
The nature of this effect leads to the conclusion that light is emitted
by negative electrons which, during emission, are moving in orbits
which are usually circular, but sometimes elliptical. As a matter of
fact it was the study of the Zeeman effect which first led to the dis-
covery of the negative electron and to a determination of the ratio of
its charge to its mass.

Radiation and atomic structure.—A constant correlation of the
facts of radiation is obtained by supposing that there are only cer-
tain definite conditions in which a negative electron may exist in
stable equilibrium in. an atom, each of these conditions being charac-
terized by a certain total energy (kinetic plus potential). In the
case of hydrogen, for example, the energies of all these states are
given by —Vh/s?, where s may have any integral value and each such
value specifies the energy of an electron in a particular state. When,
for any reason, an electron passes from any state of energy Wm to a
state of less energy W,, the difference between the energies is sent out
as radiant energy. Thus the energy radiated is Wn—W,=Nh

~— AD, Combining this with the quantum law in form W,, — W,=hn,

we have, for the frequency of the resulting radiation, n= Ns -i.)
which is the ordinary series formula for hydrogen. Similarly, for
any element, we interpret the series formula, for any two integral
values of r and m, as proportional to the difference between the en-
ergies of an electron in the two corresponding states, and take h to
be the constant of proportionality. An electron may pass from any
state to any other state. If the integer characterizing the second
state is less than that characterizing the first, energy is radiated. If
the second integer is greater than the first, energy is absorbed by the
electron, from whatever agency produces the displacement.

This, in very bald outline, is the theory of spectral radiation and of
those features of atomic structure which determine the nature of its
radiation. When we attempt to account for or describe these partic-
ular stable states (which really involves accounting for the quantum
laws) by any dynamical model of an atom, our steps become more
uncertain, although some notable advances have been made.

ATOMIC MODELS.

The Bohr theory.—Bohr, followed by Sommerfeld and Silber-
stein, has formed atomic models which have been remarkably suc-
cessful in accounting for the phenomena of radiation and ionization
(or breaking up) of systems consisting of a positive nucleus and a
single outer negative electron, but which have not been developed
154 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

successfully to account for these phenomena in more complicated sys-
tems, nor for the magnetic properties of atoms.

For the simplest case, a relatively heavy nucleus of positive charge
# and a negative electron of charge e and mass m rotating n’ times
per second about the nucleus in a circular orbit of radius a, we have
equilibrium if the electric attraction is just balanced by the centrif-
ugal force, or

oF = (2an’)’ a
The total energy, kinetic plus potential, is easily shown to be
A ila 9
W b

By the quantum law fp dq = hs it is found that the only possible
values of W are those for which W = — 14 8 hn’, where s is any
integer. By solving these three equations simultaneously we find the
various possible energies and radii of the atom to be given by sub-
stituting the various integral values of s in the equations

Since the difference of energy in any two states equals An, the vari-

where 7 and m are any two integral values of s. £# is simply the
atomic number of the element times the electronic charge e.

These three equations are in exact accord with all experimental
evidence available. The spectral tests of the latter equation are par-
ticularly severe and convincing, since substitution of the known
values of the constants makes the term outside the parenthesis exactly
equal to the observed Rydberg constant VV, so that the equation is
identical with the spectral series formula.

This theory has been extended to take account of the small motion
of the nucleus as the electron revolves, of possible elliptic as well as
circular orbits, of the variation of the mass of an electron with its
speed and of the effect of placing the atom in a strong electric field.
In every case the theory leads to results in ewact accord with the
facts. When dealing with systems with several negative electrons
outside the nucleus, the problem of the way in which they and their
orbits are distributed in space must be considered. Models with
coplanar, parallel and crossed orbits have been considered, with the
latter giving, on the whole, the best results. But the computations
are very complicated, and but little progress has been made with
such systems or with molecules.

STRUCTURE OF MATTER—COMPTON. 155

The Lewis-Langmuir theory.—In marked contrast with the pre-
ceding dynamical model of an atom, Professor Lewis and Doctor
Langmuir have developed a static theory of atomic structure to ac-
count, primarily, for the chemical valencies of atoms and the periodic
recurrence of their properties when they are arranged in the order
of their atomic numbers. In this theory the electrons outside the
nucleus are arranged as symmetrically as possible in positions on the
surfaces of imaginary concentric “ shells.” The maximum possible
numbers of electrons in these are 2 in the inmost shell, 8 in the next,
8 in the next, 18 in the next, 18 in the next, etc. No shell can contain
any electrons unless all the shells inside it contain their full quota of
electrons. The number of electrons to be thus distributed in the case
of any given atom is equal to the atomic number of the atom. Chem-
ical combinations of atoms are supposed to be due to the “ sharing ”
of electrons in common by different atoms in such a way as to give
the outer shells of all the atoms as nearly as possible their full quota
of electrons. This theory of chemical combination, which we have,
of necessity, treated very inadequately, is in more complete accord
with the facts of combination than any other yet proposed.

Discussion.—The chief weaknesses of the Bohr theory are its fail-
ure to account easily for certain chemical properties and the uncer-
tainties regarding its proper method of application to any but the
simplest atoms. The weakness of the Lewis-Langmuir theory, on the
other hand, lies in its qualitative rather than quantitative nature
and its disregard of all questions of structural stability, radiation,
and phenomena due to any part of the atom except the electrons in
the outer shell. Yet the striking successes of both theories in par-
ticular fields suggest that both contain elements of truth. The pres-
ent endeavor is, therefore, to reconcile the two viewpoints, and some
progress in this line has been achieved.

MATTER, ELECTRICITY, AND ENERGY.

Whenever an electrically charged body is set in motion a magnetic
field is set up in the region surrounding the body. But a magnetic
field can not be produced without expending energy, and it is possible
to calculate how much work must be done to set up any given mag-
netic field. Obviously, therefore, more work must be done to impart
a given speed to a body when charged than if it were uncharged.
In other words, the presence of the charge increases the inertia, or
mass, of the body. The question immediately suggests itself, there-
fore, “Is ali mass due simply to the electric charges of the positive
and negative electrons of which matter is composed?” Certain ex-
periments on the variation of the mass of a negative electron with
its speed, at speeds approaching the velocity of light, indicate that
the mass of a negative electron is entirely due to its charge, so that
156 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

it has no material mass as distinguished from electromagnetic mass.
Therefore we consider a negative electron to be not a particle of
matter bearing an electric charge, but simply a particle or unit of
negative electricity.

It has not been possible to make similar experiments with positive
electrons, but all we know about them points toward the conclusion
that they also are simply units of positive electricity. It is believed,
therefore, that matter, in its ordinary sense, is simply an aggregate
of positive and negative electric charges.

Furthermore, the electromagnetic mass of any electric charge can
be shown to be always proportional to the energy of the electric
field to which it gives rise. It is unnecessary, therefore, to distin-
guish between mass and energy. Whenever the total electrical
energy of a group of electrons changes by a change of their relative
positions the mass of the group also changes in a definite proportion.
Theoretically, therefore, all chemical combinations should result in
a change of total mass. But the energy changes in chemical reac-
tions correspond to mass changes which are too small for detection
by the most sensitive instruments. In cases of atomic disintegra-
tion, such as in radioactivity, however, the energy changes are very
large in comparison with the energy changes in chemical reaction,
and suggest the possibility of detecting the corresponding mass
changes. Sir Oliver Lodge has stated, as an example of radioactive
energy, that if the total energy liberated during the disintegration
of 1 gram of radium could be utilized for the purpose, it would suf-
fice to lift the entire British Navy several thousand feet. These
energy changes are large enough to suggest the possibility of show-
ing that the mass of radium is greater than the total mass of the
elements into which it splits up. Such measurements have not as yet
been made, since radium splits up so slowly. We therefore combine
two fundamental laws—the principle of the conservation of mass and
the principle of the conservation of energy—into a single principle,
that of the conservation of energy.

In this connection attention should be called to the probable reason
for the slight excess in the atomic weight of hydrogen over that of
the least common multiple of the other atoms. In the heavier atoms
positive and negative electrons are packed together in the nucleus,
so that their electric fields partially neutralize each other, thus dimin-
ishing the total energy and hence the total mass. If we suppose the
universe to have been originally formed by the grouping together of
positive and negative electrons, the energy liberated as they com-
bine to diminish the total mass in the observed ratio 0.77% is suffi-
cient to have accounted for the heat of the sun and stars for about
a million million million years—an ample period to satisfy the most
exacting geological and evolutionary theories.
THE ARCHITECTURE OF ATOMS AND A UNIVERSE
BUILT OF ATOMS.

By C. G. ABBor.

In a lecture given by Dr. H. N. Russell at the Carnegie Institu-
tion in December, 1922, he concluded with this remarkable state-
ment:

If a first-rate physicist, well versed in all the knowledge acquired in the
laboratory during the last quarter century on the structure and properties of
the atom, should have lived his life on a planet so enshrouded by clouds that
neither he nor others had ever glimpsed the starry heavens, yet if he had the
imagination to conceive that immense quantities of matter might lie beyond
the clouds, he would be able to picture the heavens much as they are, tell
the probable maximum masses of the stars, their minimum distances, the
range of their diameters and temperatures, the differences of their spectra,
and in short to duplicate by prediction, not only in general features but in
many of the finest details, the actual appearance of the universe forever hidden
from him.

Let us run over some parts of the course which his mind might
follow in this extraordinary prediction. First, what is an atom
and how is it related to light?

The atoms of all substances are built of what we might call the
same kinds of bricks. There are two kinds in every atom, one kind
called protons, which are positive electrical charges, and the other
called electrons, which are negative electrical charges. Of these, all
of the protons are clustered at the center or nucleus of the atom,
but some of the electrons lie in outside orbits, or if not properly
orbits then vibrating semistable configurations of definite radii as
measured from the nucleus. It is not difficult to detach electrons
from the atoms of many kinds of chemical elements. This can be
done by heating, by electrical means, and by bombardment of radium
or X rays. Sometimes the electrons pass in this manner only from
one orbit or position of configuration to the next, but sometimes they
are driven quite out of the sphere of influence of their atom, become
temporarily free electrons, and are captured by some other atom
after wandering free for a brief time. In these separations and ap-
proaches of electrons from orbit to orbit reside the absorption and

157
158 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

production of light rays and of all such rays, including the infra-red,
the visible, the ultra-violet, and the X rays.

The diameter of an atom—that is to say, the diameter of the sphere
within which all the protons and electrons of a single atom find them-
selves—does not exceed one ten-millionth part of the diameter of an
ordinary bird shot. Hence a single atom is quite too small to see
even with a microscope. Moreover, an atom, as we have remarked, is
not solid, but itself composed of a number of particles—the protons
and electrons—well separated. Indeed, these constituents of the
atom are excessively small compared to what we have just described
as the diameter of an atom. A single electron is only one fifty-
thousandth part of the diameter of an atom. Comparing this to one
of the planets, the diameter of Mars bears roughly the same ratio to
the diameter of its orbit that holds between an electron and an atom.
Similarly the nucleus of a heavy atom, like that of lead, containing
many protons and electrons, bears somewhat the same proportion to
the whole atomic volume that our sun, 865,000 miles in diameter, bears
to a sphere just inclosing the orbit of the planet Jupiter. From these
figures we see that the inclosure we call an atom is almost wholly
given up to free space. The occupied parts form hardly any greater
volume, proportionally, than the sun and planets do to the solar
system.

Matter exists in the three states—solid, liquid, and gaseous. The
two former have densities that are nearly equal. For instance, water
is of about twice the density of ice. But gases are of all densities,
from that of their liquids to as little as one pleases, depending on
the pressure one applies to keep them so. What, then, are the dis-
tances apart of the several atoms of a solid? This is known for
many crystals by experiments with X rays. In common salt, for
example, the distances are of only two or three times the magnitude
as given above for the diameter of an atom. Such, then, are the
distances between the nuclei of the atoms for solids and liquids, and
from this up to anything greater for gases, depending on the pres-
sure. In solids, and to a less extent in liquids, the atoms are so far
restricted by their mutual proximity and interacting forces of attrac-
tion and repulsion that there is no wandering, or but little, of the
atoms through the mass, so long as new forces are not introduced.
Individual electrons, freed from atoms temporarily, may easily travel
along under the urging of electric field, difference of temperature, or
bombardment by radium or X rays. In gases, however, especially
very rare gases, as in a vacuum, the whole atoms, or the combinations
of atoms called molecules, fly about over relatively long paths before
hitting each other, and so are continually remixing within the
gaseous volume.
ARCHITECTURE OF ATOMS—ABBOT. 159

The forces which define atomic positions, orbits, or spheres of in-
fluence, are electrical attraction and repulsion, and electromagnetic
effects of electric charges in motion. A neutral atom, which has
neither furnished free electrons nor captured any, has a definite
number of orbital electrons, each with its unit electrical negative
charge, and in the nucleus an excess of protons over bound electrons
sufficient to make up for the nucleus the same electrical charge as
carried by orbital electrons, but positive. Although the electrical
charges of electrons and protons are equal and opposite, the masses
of the two primitives are greatly unequal. An electron has only
about one two-thousandth part the mass of a proton. Yet the pro-
tons are not on that account larger than the electrons in dimensions,
only exceedingly more massive. _

All the usual physical and chemical properties are definitely fixed
when the excess positive charge of the nucleus is given. The excess
of positive charge on the nucleus may be gotten in two ways, either
by adding protons or subtracting electrons from it. To subtract
electrons scarcely alters appreciably the weight of the atom (atomic
weight). But to change the number of protons does essentially alter
the atomic weight. Hence it is that two dissimilar chemicals may
have about equal atomic weights, for example, bismuth and thorium-
lead each 208; while thorium-lead and uranium-lead, for example,
which are both quite indistinguishable from each other or from
ordinary lead (207.20) have atomic weights 208 and 206, respec-
tively. Readers of the Smithsonian Report for 1919 will remember
Doctor Aston’s brilliant work along these lines, and further back
in the report for 1918 Doctor Richards’s telling work on the atomic
weight of lead.

We are apt to think of solids ordinarily as completely occupying
the spaces inclosed by their boundaries. Recent knowledge shows
how radically this notion must be changed. For the protons and
electrons, which alone can be regarded as really occupying space,
are certainly more like the motes which dance in the sunbeam in a
room full of air, than like a structure completely occupying the same
volume. This shows us how it is possible for metallic wires to con-
duct electricity. It is the electrons which, flying through the free
spaces within and between the atoms, are the conducting agents.
And yet an electron does not have to travel clear along the entire
length of the wire to give the impression of an electric current. For
at the positive pole free electrons will be attracted, thus making a
void of them there, and tending to neutralize the positive pole, while
at the negative pole they will be repelled, making an excess there
and tending to neutralize the negative pole. Adjacent regions of
160 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

wire will supply the void and take up the excess as long as these
inequalities remain, just as air molecules rush along to equalize pres-
sure differences. So it is that as water buckets at a country fire are
passed from hand to hand, the electric current does not require to
be conveyed by original lactone all the way through the wire from
the negative pole to the positive pole.

But some one may ask: “If the solid bar I push my top window
shut with is no more than a flimsy structure of flying motes, how can
- it transmit pressure?” The forces of electrical attraction and repul-
sion retain to the bar its form, and, somewhat as a steam or air
riveting hammer can be operated by a medium made up of particles
well separated, so pressure can be transmitted by a bar made up of
protons and electrons.

Without pursuing this résumé of atomic science further at the
moment, let us turn to some aspects of the stars.

As woeetds their intrinsic brightness, the stars are now classed
as the giants and the dwarfs. Giants are stars which are many times,
even thousands of times, more luminous than the sun. Dwarfs are
stars which range from near the brightness of the sun to complete
extinction into cold nonluminosity like that of the earth. As regards
their color and the details of their spectra, 99 per cent of the stars
are assigned according to the universally accepted Harvard classi-
fication in six principal types, called by the letters B, A, F, G, K, M.
Originally all the letters of the alphabet from A to M were used,
but it was found presently that the classes assigned to other letters
were unnecessary and only those above named were retained. More-
over, in the rational order of development of spectrum characteristics,
class B appeared to precede class A, hence the irregular order as
given above is now always followed.

There is a very extraordinary march of change of density asso-
ciated with these star classes. The giant red star « Orionis (Betel-
geuse), of spectrum type M, recently measured at Mount Wilson, is
300 times the diameter of our sun and not more than a thousandth
part as dense as the air of the room. Our sun, a dwarf of type G,
is 1.4 times as dense as water. Barnard’s “runaway star,” a dwarf
of type M, is probably nearly as dense as the earth. This leads us
up to the view which astronomers now generally hold as to the evo-
lution of stars. Beginning to glow as rare gaseous giants of type
M, showing in their spectra the lines and bands of the metals and
compounds of them, they grow denser and hotter as time goes on,
apparently simplifying in spectra. First, the bands due to com-
pounds fall out, for, as we well know, high temperatures break up
ARCHITECTURE OF ATOMS—aABBOT. 161

all chemical compounds into atoms, then the metallic spectrum lines
grow faint, with hydrogen lines becoming strong, and at length in
the blue-white giant stage of Rigel and Spica, where maximum
temperature is reached, only hydrogen and helium lines remain.
This is the turning point. The star cools and grows denser as it goes
on into the dwarf stage. Metallic lines reappear, and at last the
star fades out as a dwarf of type M, now indistinguishable in spec-
trum, except for certain details visible only to experts (which, never-
theless, are highly characteristic of the altered density), from its
original type as a class M giant. This progress is summarized in the
following table:

The great question which this table raises is this: If a star actually
passes through the states enumerated, why do the spectrum lines of
_ the metals disappear as the star approaches its culmination as a
blue-white giant and then reappear at a later stage as a yellowish
dwarf? Can we believe that the mere exaltation of temperature
destroys the metals, resolving them into the simpler atoms of hydro-
gen and helium? Such a view at first sight seems reasonable, in
view of the now well-known fact that some of the heavy metals—
uranium, thorium, and radium—continually break down sponta-
neously with formation of helium, and that Rutherford and Chad-
wick have indeed disintegrated the lighter elements—nitrogen, boron,
fluorine, sodium, and phosphorus—with expulsion of hydrogen.
But the proportion of the atoms affected was only trifling and the
means employed for knocking out the protons from the atomic
nuclei were the alpha rays of radium, means as powerful as would
be the maintenance of a temperature of millions of degrees, perhaps
a thousand times as powerful as the effects of the actual temperatures
at the surface of the bluestars. Accordingly, we must regretfully give
up this simple temperature explanation of the disappearance of the
metals from the spectra of the hotterstars. It demands temperatures
higher than the stars afford, for measurements already made limit
us there to surface temperatures not exceeding 20,000° C.

What appears to be the main factor in the true explanation is
simpler still in essence, though involving such intricate and obscure
properties of the structure of the atoms as not yet to be fully worked
out by physicists, at least in the cases of any but the simplest of
atoms. In short, rise of temperature, or, speaking more broadly,
increased intensity of excitation, alters the atoms by setting free
electrons in such a way that the spectrum lines given out shift over
from the visible and photographic regions of the spectrum to those
of shorter wave length beyond the violet, where the earth’s atmos-
phere is not transparent to them. Thus the metallic spectra are still
present even in the hottest stars, but are merely removed from the
familiar spectrum region, where they can be observed, to another ~
where they can not penetrate our atmosphere.*

This behavior of the spectrum lines of the elements is illustrated
by laboratory work and explained by theoretical researches of Bohr,
Saha, and others on the relations of atomic structure to spectra.
Laboratory spectra are of three principal kinds, called flame, arc,
and spark spectra, according as they are excited by sources like low
temperature flames, the higher excitation of the electric arc, or the
still more intense action of the electric spark forced by high elec-
trical potential differences and often reenforced by condenser dis-

—)

164 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

charges. In flame spectra certain lines and bands of an element
are conspicuous, but these are comparatively few, and many others
are faint or lacking. In the arc the flame lines remain, but the
emphasis may fall on quite different individual lines. Many moro
spectrum lines make their appearance. Again, in the spark still
another rearrangement of intensities appears. Prominent flame and
arc lines grow faint and new lines are found. Thus differences in
spectra of the same chemical element which are produced experi-
mentally depend on the degree of excitation.

According to Bohr’s theory of the atom, when an orbital electron is
driven from its neutral position by the excitation of high tempera-
ture or electrical discharge, it may migrate to one or another of
certain orbits, determined by limitations, depending on Planck’s
theory of the so-called “ quantum,” that unit of energy which crops
up so widely in physics, as readers of Millikan’s article in this
report for 1918 are aware. In each of these possible orbits the elec-
tron has a definite energy. Returning to its normal place from one
of these excursions, the electron from an outer to an inner orbit
gives up the difference between the definite energies appropriate to
the two situations and thereby gives rise to radiation in a specific
spectrum line. If the electron temporarily occupies successively sev-
eral orbits during its return, several spectrum lines are formed cor-
responding in the frequency of their vibrations to the several definite
differences of energy involved. The actual spectrum at a given in-
stant is the joint result of all the electronic excursions of all the
atoms involved.

The difference between are spectra and spark spectra is explained
as follows: In are spectra the lines are supposed to be produced by
the migrations of single electrons displaced from each of the par-
taking atoms. In spark spectra two electrons may be removed, one
to a great distance. This one is that which took part in arc spec-
trum phenomena. It is assumed to be eliminated from the system.
But the second electron in falling back to its position produces a
similar series of spectrum effects, but involving different amounts of
energy, and thus different frequencies of vibration for the lines pro-
duced. These new spectrum lines are then associated with the second
displaced electron and with the twice-shorn remainder of the atomic
structure. As the new energies involved greatly exceed the old, the
frequencies of vibration are correspondingly enhanced, so that on the
whole the new lines lie toward the violet of the old, and may even lie
beyond the region of experimentation.

Complicated and hypothetical as all this may seem with so inade-
quate a presentation as the above, yet remarkable predictions have
been made thereby which were later experimentally verified with
ARCHITECTURE OF ATOMS—ABBOT. 165

most striking success. Unfortunately the mathematical analysis be-
comes hopelessly involved for elements of high atomic weight, so that
such verifications are confined so far to the simpler atoms, such as
hydrogen, helium, and some of the alkalis.

Bohr’s atomic theory received complementary contributions useful
for explaining the spectra of the stars from considerations advanced
by Saha. He points out that within the range of temperatures and
pressures: (hardly less important than temperatures) prevailing in
the gases at the surface of a given star, the different elements will be
ionized in different degrees, depending on their characteristic “ ioni-
zation potentials,” some of which have been measured in the labora-
tory. Also that the numbers of neutral atoms, atoms less one
electron, atoms less two electrons, etc., are (in principle at least, if
not yet in actual fact) calculable thermodynamically from energy
considerations connected with the ionization potentials, the tempera-
tures and the pressures prevailing. Proceeding to illustrate with
assumed numbers for the element calcium, he shows that as between
temperatures of 2,000° and 4,000°, absolute centigrade, the relative
strength of lines corresponding respectively to neutral, once-shorn,
and twice-shorn atoms must have altered immensely in favor of the
latter, and so at the higher temperature the line spectrum of calcium
will have gone over predominantly into a region of shorter wave ©
lengths. Moreover, as the permanent gases, hydrogen, helium, and
others, have greatly higher “ ionization potentials ” than elements like
sodium, calcium, and others, the stimulation will at first pass by pref-
erence to the easily excitable atoms of the latter in cases of mixture
of elements like that prevailing in the sun and stars. But as the
easily ionizable elements become fully ionized, and, with the loss of
one or even two or more electrons, become greatly more difficultly
excitable, the stimulus of the temperature will more and more be
diverted to affect difficultly ionizable gases like hydrogen and helium.

Hence, from two directions the spectra are influenced to alter as the
star temperature waxes greater. First the dissociation of the atoms
of the metals tends to throw the intensity of metallic spectra more
and more into the ultraviolet regions which le beyond our observa-
tion owing to the absorption in our atmosphere. Second, the in-
creased difficulty of exciting these once-shorn or twice-shorn metallic
atoms throws the effects of the temperature stimuli more and more to
intensify the lines of the difficultly ionizable hydrogen and helium.
Finally, the less conspicuous but highly significant and experimen-
tally valuable influences of changes of pressure associated with the
march of stellar evolution find equally satisfactory theoretical ex-
planations. All of this is wholly in accord with the observations of

5587T9—24——12
166 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

the spectra of the sun and stars, and many of the details which have
heretofore been among the apparently insoluble puzzles of celestial
spectroscopy are becoming clear in the light of Saha’s expositions.
These cover not merely emission but absorption of light in the most
striking manner. If it were possible to express these in language
easily to be understood, the reader would join in the wave of enthusi-
asm which is just sweeping through the workers in astronomical
spectroscopy and kindred lines as they see the great problems of
stellar evolution yielding to laboratory experiment and penetrating
theory.
AERONAUTIC RESEARCH."

By JoserH 8. AMES, Ph. D., LL. D.

Professor of Physics, The Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, Maryland;
Chairman, Executive Committee, National Advisory Committee for Aero-
nautics,

[With 5 plates.]

Progress in the navigation of the air is being made constantly
along two quite distinct and independent lines; one is the art of
flying and the other is the science of flight. To this last is given
the name aeronautics; and by an aeronautical investigation is meant
a research which has a direct bearing upon our knowledge of the
properties of solid bodies immersed in a stream of air or moving
through the air. We wish to know the forces and moments acting
upon such solid bodies; how these vary with the shape and charac-
teristics of the bodies, and how they are affected if the velocity of
the air is changed. Another important inquiry refers to the sta-
bility of the solid body when in flight; if the attitude of the body
is changed by some gust or otherwise, does it tend to return to
its previous attitude, or on the contrary does it continue to depart
more and more from its original attitude? The question is like
that referring to a body balanced on a table. If it is pushed slightly,
will it simply oscillate to and fro, or will it turn over? ‘These
matters and similar ones make up the subject of aeronautics; and
in order to investigate them the same methods must be applied as
in any department of physics.

Experiments must be performed; a theory is evolved; deductions
are made from the theory and tested by experiment; the theory
is modified and improved, etc. During all the process knowledge
is being gained, and the facts being made known help the designer
of aircraft to make improvements in speed, in carrying power, in
safety, in stability.

One most important fact should be emphasized, and this is that with-
out the series of scientific studies just outlined not only would flight
itself have been impossible, but also all progress in the art would

cease. Scientific investigation forms the most important feature
of aviation, and it can be conducted only by trained students. The
best pilot in the world may know very little about the scientific
principles underlying flight, and he would therefore be unable to
make any marked improvements in his machine. Aeronautics is
in no sense a function of an engineer or constructor or aviator, it is
a branch of pure science. Those countries have developed the best
airships and airplanes which have devoted the most thought, time
and money to the underlying scientific studies. When the physical
facts are known, the engineer can design his aircraft, the constructor
can make it, and the trained man can fly it; but the foundation stone
is the store of knowledge obtained by the scientist.

Fic. 1.—Combination of source and sink.

Before describing the types of investigations in progress in aero-
nautics and the methods pursued, it may be interesting to see some
illustrations of the two types of aircraft now in use—the airship
and the airplane. If I had time, I would lke very much to say
something about the helicopter, a type of aircraft to which we have
given a name before constructing one. Up to the present no such
machine, worthy of the name, has been made; but beyond a doubt
one will be constructed, and in the near future.

An airship owes its flying power to the fact that it is made
“lighter than air” by being filled with a gas lighter than air.
Hydrogen is the gas always used, although helium may be. The
lifting power of the latter gas is about four-fifths of that of
hydrogen. As the airship moves through the air, it meets with
AERONAUTIC RESEARCH—AMES. 169

opposition as the air flows along its surface. Forces are required
to move the control surfaces, z. e., the rudders and elevators. We
must determine these forces, and must investigate the changes in
them as we change the shape of the airship, e. g., its length or its
cross-section. A great deal may be learned by studying theoreti-
cally the way in which air flows around a solid body shaped
more or less like an airship. A most interesting mode of attack
on this problem was devised by Admiral Taylor of our Navy, and
was applied by him to the design of ocean vessels. The drawings
illustrate how a uniform flow superposed upon a source and sink
produces a condition like the flow around an airship. This type

of flow may then be studied mathematically; the pressures may be
deduced, etc.

Similarly, in the case of airplanes, we must know the character
of airflow past the struts, the fuselage, and the wings. It is the
difference in the pressure on the two sides of a wing that produces
the upward force required to support the machine. The figures
on plate 3 illustrate the type of flow around the aerofoil.

Great progress has been made in recent years by Prandtl and
other German physicists by showing how a flow of air around
an aerofoil could be produced in an ideal frictionless gas similar
to that observed in air by imagining vortices or whirls in the gas.
The method is not unlike that mentioned above as useful in the
case of airships, only vortices are used in place of sources and sinks.
170 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

Following this process, Prandtl and his associates have shown how
one could calculate the influence of one wing of a biplane upon the
other, so that if the behavior of one wing is known that of two
may be deduced; and they have proceeded much further and made
aeronautics into a beautiful theoretical science.

But in the end the function of aeronautic research is obviously
to learn all there is to be known about the forces acting on an aero-
foil or wing. How can this be done? It is not possible to make
actual airplanes of various types and test them, nor would this help
us much if it were practicable. We must actually measure the
forces involved in any one case, and must vary our conditions in
every conceivable way, but in a systematic manner. There are
several methods open to us. One is to make a model of a wing,
say, as nearly full size as possible, suspend it by wires 30 feet or

more below an airplane which can carry it in flight, and then, by
inserting measuring instruments in the wires, study the forces
under varying conditions. This method is being used with marked
success at Langley Field, near Old Point Comfort, Va., by the staff
of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. It is called
the “ free-flight method.”

A second method is to make a small model of a wing or a
fuselage or an entire machine, say, one twenty-fifth the size of the
actual part, and then to investigate the forces acting on it when
it is placed in a rapidly moving stream of air. This is known as
the wind-tunnel method, and is now in general use in all countries.
England has 10 or more such tunnels, France has several, Ger-
many has a large number, etc. In this country there are 12, and
more are being made.

Other methods have been used in the past but are no longer.
Langley attached his models to one end of a long arm which could
AERONAUTIC RESEARCH—AMES. ETA

be made to revolve rapidly in a horizontal plane. Others have
studied models of different shapes by dropping them from heights
inside buildings, so as to avoid wind.

Investigators in these different laboratories all over the world
have studied the greatest variety of problems—forces on models of
wings of different shapes at different air velocities, forces on models
of airships, the effect of disturbing elements on these forces, etc. A
long series of investigations has been made in particular upon air
propellers. The blade of a propeller may be considered as made

up of a number of separate surfaces, and when the shaft is rotating
each of these is thought of as an aerofoil moving rapidly through
the air. In this way the action of a propeller may be calculated,
and the theory may be tested by trying the actual propeller. But
there is one all-important difficulty in applying the knowledge thus
available to the design of actual aircraft. Is one justified in drawing

conclusions as to the properties of large bodies from knowledge of
the properties of smaller ones? Suppose, for instance, that on com-
paring two models on a scale of one twenty-fifth of full size in a
wind tunnel through which the velocity of the air stream is 40 miles
per hour, it is found that one model has a greater lift or a less drag
than the other, what conclusion could one draw as to the comparative
properties of two actual airplane wings in flight at 120 miles per
AERONAUTIC RESEARCH—AMES. 173

hour? The answer is, “ Possibly none.” The exact condition under
which results from tests on models may be applied to actual con-
struction is known. This can best be described by discussing what
is called in aerodynamics the “ Reynolds number.” When a body is
moving through the air there are two types of forces acting on it—
the air exerts a pressure upon it and there is friction between the
moving air and the layer of air sticking tight to the solid. It is not
difficult to see that the four physical quantities involved in the aero-
dynamical action are: The velocity of the air, its density, its viscosity
(i. e., measure of the frictional property), and the size of the solid
body as given by its length or its thickness. Lord Rayleigh showed
many years ago that if we formed the quantity—

Fic. 7.—Compressed air wind-tunnel,

which is now called the “ Reynolds number,” we would be justified in
saying that the properties observed in any experiment would also
be found to be the same for any other experiment having the same
Reynolds number. It is seen by looking at the definition of this
number that we can have the same Reynolds number for a large
number of different experiments. Thus, compare an actual airplane
in flight at 90 miles per hour, say, with a wind-tunnel experiment on
a model of one-twentieth scale but having the same velocity of air
flow. If the Reynolds number is to be the same for the two cases,
it is necessary to increase the density of the air in the wind tunnel
twentyfold. This shows that if one were to make a wind tunnel
in which the air is compressed to 20 or more atmospheres, experi-
ments on models placed in it would give results immediately appli-
cable to full-size airplanes. It is perfectly possible, of course, that
174 ANNUAL REPORT SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION, 1922.

certain properties studied and observed in ordinary wind tunnels
at atmospheric pressure may hold also for actual airplanes, but one
can not be certain of this until the question is investigated in a com-
pressed-air tunnel. In view of the great importance of this matter,
the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics has designed,
and has now under construction such a tunnel, in which the air may
be compressed to 25 atmospheres. When completed it will be the
only one in the world; and it is expected confidently that a great
amount of useful information will be obtained.

I have outlined the experimental methods available for aero-
nautical investigations, and wish now to state briefly some of the
more important ones which occupy our thoughts:

1. Everyone, the world over, is interested in designing a heli-
copter; but before this can be done we must have knowledge of the
properties of a propeller whose shaft is very oblique to the flight
path, and we probably shall have to design a new type of propeller.

2. A greater range of speed for any one airplane is desirable, so
that it may attain a great flying speed and yet have a slow landing
speed. In order to secure this possibility, modifications of the wing
are essential; and the most promising form at the present time is the
Handley-Page slotted wing. Much more research is, however, neces-
sary.

3. Great improvements may be expected in reducing the drag, or
resistance, of aircraft, and many researches are now in progress as to
the effect of putting the engine and the propeller in different posi-
tions, of changing the position of the fuselage, etc.

4. Over 100 different wing forms have been investigated, but our
practical knowledge is far from satisfactory, largely owing to the
fact that the tests have been made in different laboratories and at
different air velocities. Further, of course, the Reynolds number in
all tests has been too small. When the compressed-air wind tunnel
at the Langley Memorial Laboratory is finished, we will be able defi-
nitely to say what wing is best for any specific purpose.

These are simply illustrations of the type of investigations now
engaging the attention of aeronautical laboratories, but they serve,
I hope, to make clear how interesting the subject is to the scientist
and how important to the designer of aircraft.
