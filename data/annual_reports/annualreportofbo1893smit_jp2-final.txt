JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

ANNUAL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

JANUARY 25, 1893.

The annual meeting of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution was held to-day at 10.a.m. Present: The chancellor, Mr.
Chief Justice Fuller; Vice-President L. P. Morton; the Hon. J.S. Mor-
rill; the Hon. S. M. Cullom; the Hon. George Gray; the Hon. Joseph
Wheeler; the Hon. Henry Cabot Lodge; the Hon. W. C. P. Breckin-
ridge; Dr. J. C. Welling; Dr. Henry Coppée; Dr. William Preston
Johuston; John B. Henderson, esq., and the secretary.

A letter was read from Dr. J. B. Angell, stating that his nonattend-
ance was on account of important business engagements.

The secretary then presented the minutes of the last annual meeting
of January 27, 1892, and of the special meeting of March 29, 1892, which,
at the suggestion of the chancellor, he read in abstract. Referring to
the mention there of authority given by the Regents at the last regular
meeting to bring the matter of an additional appropriation for admin-
istrative expenses before Congress, the secretary remarked that the
time had not been considered opportune and that the Regents’ authori-
zation had not yet been acted upon.

The minutes of both meetings were approved.

The secretary then announced that the Vice-President, on December
20, 1892, appointed as Regent the Hon. George Gray, a U. 8S. Sen-
ator, in place of the Hon. R. L. Gibson, deceased. Also that by
joint resolution, approved by the President January 9, 1893, Dr. J. B.
Angell had been reappointed a Regent to succeed himself, his term
expiring January 19, 1593.

The secretary announced the death of the Hon. R. L. Gibson on
December 15, 1892, remarking that one who had known him longer
and better than he had, would doubtless say what was fitting in this
connection.

Dr. Johnston then moved that a committee be appointed to draft a
suitable memorial and resolutions, which was carried, and the chaneel-
lor appointed Dr. Johnston, Senator Morrill, and the secretary a com-

xI
XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

mittee of three to report the resolutions to the board. Dr. Johnston then
presented the following memorial and resolutions, which were adopted :

THE BOARD OF REGENTS:

Your committee report that the Hon. Randall Lee Gibson was appointed a Regent
of the Smithsonian Institution December 19, 1887, and filled that office until his
death, December 15, 1892.

Senator Gibson brought to the performance of his duties as Regent a rare prepa-
ration as student, scholar, and statesman. With inherited talents for oratory and
with strong literary tendencies, he was surrounded in youth by all the influences
that direct the energies of man to the public welfare. At Yale College he took a
very prominent stand in a group noted for talents and enthusiasm. Foreign travel,
the study of the law, the life of a planter, a distinguished military career, and long
service in the Congress of the United States filled his capacious mind with a store
of arich and varied experience and trained him for the highest duties. Life was
to him a consecration to public duty, and the performance of that duty his highest
felicity. Benevolent, brave, patient, prudent, faithfal, his grace and gentleness
were the rich drapery of an inflexible will and tenacious purpose.

He came to the Smithsonion Institution as a servant animated by the fullest sense
of his responsibilities and self-pledged to a rigid performance of them. His interest
in the institution has been limited only by the conditions of his position. His
death is a loss to his State and his country, in whose councils he has served for
eighteen years.

In view of these facts, it is—

Resolved, That in the death of the Hon. Randall Lee Gibson the Smithsonian
Institution has lost a zealous and useful regent, and its board a valued member
whose services can ill be spared.

Resolved, That we lament his loss as an acceptable colleague, a gracious gentle-
man, a patriotic citizen, and a wise statesman, whose interest in the spread of
knowledge among men fitted him well for his duties on this board,

Resolved, That these resolutions be entered on the minutes of the board and a
copy be transmitted to the family of our friend.

Dr. Johnston added that Senator Gibson’s death Was a particular
sorrow to him; they had been friends from boyhood with never a single
cloud in their friendship. He was with Senator Gibson in his last hours
and felt in his death a great personal loss, and he did not doubt that _
all who knew him personally regretted his loss to themselves and to
the country.

The secretary then announced the death on March 4, 1892, of Dr.
Noah Porter, a former Regent.

The secretary presented his report for the year ending June 30, 1892,
stating that if was confined to matters of major importance, matters of
detail being found in the appendix. He had endeavored to put into it
only matters that might demand publicity, and had arranged the report
in this form so as to permit it tobe read. He had dwelt at some length
on the features of the National Zoological Park. The rest of the report
would speak for itself, but he might call attention to statements about
the disposition of the income of that portion of Mr. Hodgkin’s gift which
was specially directed to one purpose, and to the form of some of the
letters written to distinguished men all over the world in relation to it.

The report was accepted.
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII

Dr. Welling, on behalf of his colleagues, presented the report of the
executive committee to June 30, 1892, which was adopted.

Dr. Welling also said that he would here present the usual resolu-
tion relative to the income and expenditures of the institution, which
was adopted, as follows:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1894, be appropriated for the service of the institution, to be expended by the Secre-
tary with the advice of the executive committee, upon the basis of the operations
described in the last annual report of said committee, with full discretion on the
part of the secretary as to items of expenditures properly falling under each of
the heads embraced in the established conduct of the institution,

Dr. Welling then said that at the last regular meeting, the secretary
had presented a statement of the burdens imposed by the need of his

personally signing ail purely routine money papers, and the boaiwl had
referred a resolution on the subject to the executive committee, with
power to act. He would now present the result of their action as fol-
lows:

WASHINGTON, D. C., April 15, 1892.

Whereas a member of the Board of Regents, at their last meeting on January 27,
1892, offered the following resolution :

“Resolved, That the Secretary be empowered to appoint some suitable person who,
in case of need, may sign such requisitions, vouchers, abstracts of vouchers, accounts
current, and indorsements of checks and drafts, as are needed in the current business
of the Institution or of any of its bureaus, and are customarily signed in the bureaus
of other Departments of the Government.”

And whereas this was referred to the executive committee with power to act—

Resolved, That the executive committee approve the resolution in the terms pro-
posed, and confirm the Secretary in the powers therein mentioned.

JAMES C. WELLING,

HENRY CoOpPEE,

J. B. HENDERSON,
Executive Committee.

Dr. Welling added that the action was taken simply to relieve the
Secretary of what was becoming a too heavy tax upon his time and in
other ways an increasing burden, and it was to further provide that, in
case of his absence, the work of the Institution should not be sus-
pended; that he had now power to delegate authority to sign such
routine papers.

The Secretary announced the death of Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins on
November 25, 1892, and read the following obituary notice:

Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins, who died at Setauket, Long Island, on November 25,
1892, was born in London, England, in 1803. His ancestors were clergymen, and
belonged to the class of English gentlemen, but his father, who was in reduced cir-
cumstances, was unable to keep him at Eton or Harrow, and sent him to France,
where he remained for his education until he was about 15 years old. During this
time his language, habits, and manners became rather French than English.

He returned to England, but troubles with a stepmother made his home anbear-
able, and against the urgent entreaty of his father he shipped before the mast in a
trading vessel bound for Calcutta. The vessel was wrecked near the mouth of the
XIV. JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

Hoogly, and young Hodgkins found himself penniless and friendless in Caleutta,
where he was taken ill and carried to the hospital. He has since said that it was
here, and when he was a sick lad, who was told that he had not six months to live,
that he made up his mind that he would live, that he would acquire a fortune, and
that he would devote it to large and philanthropic ends.

He recovered sufficiently to prepare a petition to the Governor-General of India,
who was then the Marquis of Hastings, asking for aid to return to England; and
he walked a long distance into the country, where the Governor-General was staying
at his country seat, to deliver it. He arrived at the vice-regal residence bare footed
and ill-clad, and asked an audience with the ruler of India with such persistence
that the attendants, who at first refused, finally consented to present his petition.
This so impressed the viceroy when he read it that he directed that the young
sailor should be admitted to see him, and the interview that followed ended by his
offering young Hodgkins a position in his household which any gentleman’s son
might have been willing to accept, but which he refused from his overmastering
wish to return to his father.

I think this curious adventure (as it may almost le called) deserves narration as
an instance both of the remarkable force of Mr. Hodgkins’s character and of the evi-
dence of gentle breeding his manners always bore, and of the influence both had on
others even in his earliest years.

After going home he went to Spain, and later, returning to England, he married, and
in 1830 came to thiscountry. He immediately engaged in business, which he pursued
with unremitting energy for thirty years, when he retired on what was at that time
considered « handsome fortune. The fifteen years following this he spent in trav-
elling over Europe and America, and in 1875 he settled down in Setauket, Long
Island, upon his place ‘‘Brambletye Farm,” which he rarely left, except for an
occasional visit to New York, until his death.

Mr. Hodgkins was a man of remarkably self-poised mind, singularly independent
in his modes of thought, and independent also of the need of social converse or of
adventitious interests. His opinions were his own, and he found in the reading
which confirmed them and in the care of his little farm abundant and agreeable
occupation for his declining years. He was a man of keen intelligence, and by
nature, perhaps, still more a thinker anda scholar than a man of affairs, though
even in the latter capacity his ability was proven by his success in business. He
possessed a strong will, and had deliberately formed and tenaciously held opinions
of his own in relation to religious and philosophical questions. In regard to the
former, it may be sufficient to say that his mind was of a devout cast, and that
while he had thought much for himself, he retained to the last an absolute trust in
the divine guidance as the leading motive of his life.

Mr. Hodgkins had for more than thirty years made a special study of the atmos-
phere in its relations to the well-being of humanity. He believed that most of the
physical evils to which mankind are subject arise from the vitiation of the air
which they breathe, and that the study of the atmosphere is not unimportant even
with relation to man’s moral and spiritual, as well as his physical health; and
though he did not point out any line of investigation likely to bear fruit in the latter
direction, it was his hope that the concentration of thought upon the atmosphere
and its study from every point of view, would in time lead to results which would
justify his almost devout interest in the subject.

In this last respect, his beliefs about the atmosphere, otherwise clear enough,
were not always easy to follow, but though all those who talked to him were not
sure that they here understood his full meaning, it was at least plain that he was
well content to place his trust in the charge of such an institution as the Smith-
sonian, and to leave it to the future to shape the result.

He was very explicit, however, in his statements that it was not for sanitary sci-
ence or for meteorology, or for the like branches of study alone or for those which
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XV

might seem most obviously suggested by the words of his trust, to profit exclu-
sively by it, for he believed that every department of philosophy (using the term
in its widest sense) would be found to be finally connected with every cther, through
this common bond of union; so that it was his particular desire to have such varied
investigations in the atmosphere made as would aid in the knowledge of each and
all of these aspects of knowledge.

Mr. Hodgkins brought to all his studies, as to this, a very retentive memory,
while general reading and travel had stored his mind with singularly varied infor-
mation. He was a good French scholar and loved to quote from the French classics,
His catholicity of mind was sufficient to include a not inconsiderable sense of humor,
and his favorite quotation from Boileau pointed to his consciousness of a perhaps
too imaginative indulgence in his favorite themes. He was a punctilious corres-
pondent, and what it is not too much to call his real literary ability, was nevershown
more happily than in his letters, which were in many respects models of epistolary
ease, and even of charm, of diction. He was hospitable and enjoyed entertaining
the few friends whom he admitted to his table, where his manner, as a host of the
old school, was a happy one.

Mr. Hodgkins had no family and no known blood relations, and, recognizing the
difficulties which often arise over the settlements of large estates, he chose to be
his own executor rather than leave the disposition of his affairs to those who might
either misinterpret or disregard his requests when he could no longer appear as a
witness in his own behalf. He therefore gave away his entire estate, amounting to
about half a million dollars, to various public institutions.

His funeral was unostentatious, as he requested it should be, only his intimate
friends attending. Among these he (the Secretary) was numbered; for while he felt
it his official duty to represent this Institution at the funeral of one to whom it owed
so much, he desires to say, in concluding this brief notice, that he was there also from
a feeling of real friendship and regard to an old man whose singular powers, whose
lonely life, and whose perhaps often unmet affection had drawn the speaker to him
as to a personal friend.

Mr. Wheeler remarked that the gentleman who had given the Insti-
tution somuch deserved some special record of his death, and he moved
that the notice should be extended by the Secretary, should include a
statement of the gifts he had made, and should be spread upon the
records of the Board. The motion was carried.

The Secretary then presented the portrait of Mr. Hodgkins, which
he stated he had wished to order under the instructions of the Board
during Mr. Hodgkins’s lifetime, but owing to that gentleman’s relue-
tance to be portrayed, it was not executed until after his death, and
from a photograph. It was not yet finished, the artist, Mr. Robert
Gordon Hardie, desiring its return in order that he might elaborate it.

The Secretary added that from his knowledge of the original he consid-
ered, and that the assistant secretary Dr. Goode (who was well quali-
fied to judge), also considered the picture a very satisfactory likeness
indeed. Dr. Welling remarked that it looked as if it could hardly be
much improved as a likeness by much greater elaboration. Mr. Lodge
said that while he could not, of course, speak of the likeness in case of
one he had not seen, the picture bore its own evidence that it was a
piece of good work. Other commendatory remarks were made.

The secretary called the attention of the Regents to the action taken
with regard to that portion of the Hodgkins fund which was especially
XVI. JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

deyoted to scientific purposes. He had taken counsel with many emi-
nent scientific men in Europe as well as at home, as to the best dispo-
sition to make of this fund, and given the matter much thought. A
portion of the results of this care was embodied in the circular which
he then presented for the consideration of the board.

He stated that it was the intention to send this cireular to all parts
of the world, and that after eliminating from the list of the correspond-
ents of the institution, those which it was not considered should receive
it—about two-thirds in all—there yet remained about 8,000 to be sup-
plied; and these were scattered all over the inhabited parts of the
globe, including Africa, and the small islands of the Pacific.

In affixing the old seal of the institution to these, the secretary had
noticed that it bore no legend or indication of the institution’s pur-
poses, although to the vast majority of those receiving it, these were
unknown. He had been led by this to prepare a new seal in which the
words of Smithson, ‘ For the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men” should take the place of his face. He would speak of this later.

The circular was examined by the members of the board. The chan-
cellor said it night be well to state on the heading of the circular that
the President of the United States was ex-officio presiding officer of
the institution, and the secretary stated that he would act on the sug-
gestion.

After reading the circular in brief, the secretary recurred to the sub-
ject of the seal. He said he had consulted a number of sources for
such a design, without much success, until he had finally been fortu-
nate in securing one from Mr. St. Gaudens, who had made one from
the secretary’s indications, which he was glad to submit to the regents.

The Secretary remarked that the preparation of the circular and the
announcement of the prizes and medal had been made under the instrue-
tions of the board that this portion of the income should be expended
in carrying out the express wishes of the donor. The circular had been
varried down to Setauket and was one of the last things that had oceu-
pied the attention of Mr. Hodgkins. He was personally consulted about
it and approved the plan.

Mr. Lodge then offered the following resolution, which was adopted;

Resolved, That the Secretary be authorized to procure a new seal for the institu-
tion, with a suitable motto and device, to comprehend the words of Smithson, ‘For

the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,” and also the words, “Smith-
sonian Institution, Washington, 1846.”

The Secretary then read a portion of the will of Mr. Hodgkins where
he makes the institution his residuary legatee. He wished to state that
he had learned from the executor, but altogether unofficially, that the
anount coming to the institution under this will, as residuary legatee,
was but a few thousand dollars, Mr. Hodgkins having meant to give
away as far as possible all of his property at the time of his death. He
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XVII

also stated that it was, however, probable that certain bonds deposited

by Mr. Hodgkins inatrust company, though forming no portion of the

residuary estate, would come to the institution, and he asked the instruc-

tions of the Regents as to their disposition. ;
Dr. Welling then read the following resolution :

Resolved, That the Secretary be authorized to sell at the market price, any bonds
or securities which may accrue to the institution as residuary legatee of the late
Thomas G. Hodgkins, or from any trust instituted by him in its favor, if it is in the
Secretary’s judgment desirable to do so; and should there accrue any further sum
not demanding the special consideration of the Regents by its importance, that he
be authorized to apply it to the general purposes of the institution.

On motion of Senator Cullom, the resolution was adopted.

The Secretary then brought before the board the matter of the
change in the organization of the establishment, calling attention to
two points for consideration :

Ata meeting of the Regents on January 28, 1891, the Secretary stated
that he had been authorized by the President, the Vice-President, the
Chief-Justice, and other members of the establishment to ask for legis-
lation to make the establishment consist of the President, Vice-Pres-
ident, Chief-Justice, and all the heads of Departments.

Since the Institution was established the place filled by the Commis-
sioner of Patents would seem to have been taken by the creation of the
Secretary of the Interior. The Secretary of Agriculture has been cre-
ated, while the office of the governor of the District of Columbia no
longer exists.

The proposed change would be covered by the following act:

Be it enacted, etc, That ‘‘An act to establish the Smithsonian Institution for the
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,” approved August 10, 1846, Revised
Statutes, Title Lxx111, be, and the same is hereby, amended in Section 5579 of said
act by striking out the words ‘the Secretary of State, the Secretary of the Treasury,
the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, the Postmaster-General, the Attor-
ney-General, the Commissioner of the Patent-Office, and the governor of the District
of Columbia, and such other persons as they may elect honorary members,” and
inserting the words ‘‘the heads of Executive Departments,” so that the section will
read:

“Src. 5579. The President, the Vice-President, the Chief-Justice, and the heads
of Executive Departments are hereby constituted an establishment by the name of
the ‘Smithsonian Institution’ for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among
men; and by that name shall be known and have perpetual succession, with the
powers, limitations, and restrictions hereinafter contained, and no other.”

The Secretary said that he had consulted the President, the Vice-
President, the Chief Justice, the Secretary of State, and those two
members of the Cabinet mostly interested, and had their sanction in
making this suggestion, and though it was a matter which concerns
the establishment, he thought it proper to state his proposed action to
the Regents, and if there were no objection on their part, he would
infer their assent to this the first amendment sought.

SM 93 II

XVIII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

The second change proposed by the Secretary, after consultation
with the Chief Justice, and after an examination of the fundamental
act by Mr. H. E. Davis, was as follows:

To amend Section 5591 of the Revised Statutes by the addition of
these words:

But this shall not operate as a limitation on the power of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion to receive money or other property by gift, bequest, or devise, and to hold and
dispose of the same in promotion of the purposes thereof, and as ere ede in the next
section.

The chancellor said, with regard to legislation concerning the funds,
that section 5591 might possibly as it stood appear to operate as a limit-
ation; and that, though he did not himself consider that any reason-
able doubt could arise as to the right of the Regents to hold property
outside of the million any more than to deposit sums within it, yet, out
of abundant precantion, he bad approved of the addition of the words
as read.

A motion by Senator Morrill that the Secretary be authorized to draw
up a bill providing for such changes in the legislation as were desir-
able in sections 5579 and 5591 of the Revised Statutes, and to present
the same to the Senate and House through Congressional Regents, was
then put by the chancellor and carried.

There being no further business to come before the board, on motion
it adjourned.

REPORT OF 8, P. LANGLEY,
SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1893.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

GENTLEMEN: I have the honor to submit herewith a report of the
operations of the Smithsonian Institution for the year ending June 30,
1893, including the work placed by Congress under its supervision in
the National Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the Bureau of Inter-
national Exchanges, the Zodlogical Park, and the Astro-Physical Ob-
servatory.

I have endeavored to give in the body of the report, and as briefly as
possible, a general account of the affairs of the Institution for the year,
reserving for the appendix the more detailed and statistical reports
from the officers in charge of the different branches of work.

The report upon the National Museum by the Assistant Secretary,
Dr. G. Brown Goode, is here given only in abstract. Its full presenta-
tion occupies a separate volume. (Report of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, National Museum, 1893.)

SM 93——1 1
2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its stated annual meeting occurs on the
fourth Wednesday in each year, the board met on January 25, 1893,
at 10 o’clock A. M. The journal of its proceedings will be found, as
hitherto, in the annual report of the board to Congress, though refer-
ence is here made to several matters upon which action was taken at
this meeting.

The changes that have taken place in the membership of the Board
of Regents have been—

First, through the death of Senator R. L. Gibson, which occurred on
December 15,1892. Senator George Gray, of Delaware, was appointed
on December 20, 1892, by the Vice-President to fill the unexpired term
of Senator Gibson, and having been re-elected as Senator from Dela-
ware, was re-appointed Regent on March 16, 1893.

A brief sketch of Senator Gibson’s life is given in the necrological
notices that close the present report, but I may quote here the follow-
ing resolutions prepared by a committee consisting of Dr. Wm. Preston
Johnston, Senator J. 8S. Morrill, and the Secretary, which were pre-
sented at the meeting of the Regents on January 25, 1893:

Resolved, That in the death of Hon. Randall Lee Gibson, the Smith-
sonian Institution has lost a zealous and useful Regent, and its board
a valuable member whose services can ill be spared.

Resolved, That we lament his loss as an acceptable colleague, a
gracious gentleman, a patriotic citizen, and a wise statesman, whose
interest in the spread of knowledge among men fitted him well for
his duties on the board.

Resolved, That these resolutions be entered on the minutes of the
board, and a copy be transmitted to the family of our friend.

Second, President James B. Angell, of the University of Michigan,
whose previous term of office expired on January 13, 1893, was reap-
pointed for six years by a joint resolution introduced by Senator J.S.
Morrill, of Vermont, which passed the Senate on December 20, 1892,
the House of Representatives on January 6, 1893, and was approved
by the President January 10, 1593.

ADMINISTRATION.

I have called attention to the desirability of securing from Congress
an appropriation to meet actual outlays incurred in administering Goy-
ernmental trusts. These direct outlays for matters not equitably
chargeable to the fund of James Smithson, are growing amore consid-
erable tax upon it each year. They are incurred in serving purely
Governmental interests, but they are not met by any of the present
appropriations, since they belong not singly to the National Museum,
or the Bureau of Ethnology, or to the International Exchange service,
or the like, but to expenditures common to all of them, and which
are not provided for by the terms of the appropriations for any one.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

It is in the interests of economy that this expenditure should be met
from some common source, owing to the limited size of the establish-
ments in question, some of which are rather assimilable to divisions
than to bureaus. It is evident, for instance, that an appropriation of
$17,000 for international exchanges, or an appropriation of $10,000 for
an observatory, can not each so well bear the separate provision of a dis-
bursing officer, a stenographer, and the other like employés, as in the
case of larger bureaus, but that their limited needs can be better and more
economically managed by not duplicating such offices. There is, how-
ever, no practicable way of arranging this in compliance with the pres-
ent terms of the appropriations, which may be said to tacitly assume
that each of these bureaus or divisions is thus completely provided for.

Itis in some cases impossible that it should be so without the expen-
diture of greatly more than the appropriated sum, and the terms of the
appropriations should in the interest of economy, either recognize the
propriety of meeting each bureaw’s share of these common expenses out
of each one’s appropriation, or else out of a special appropriation made
in their common interest.

FINANCES.

The permanent funds of the Institution remain the same as at the
time of my last report, and are as follows:

This sum of $905,000 is deposited in the Treasury of the United
States, and by act of Congress bears interest at 6 per cent per annum,
the interest alone being used in carrying out the aims of the Institution.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1, 1892, the balance on hand
was $47,875.53. Interest on the invested funds, amounting to $54,180,
was received during the year, which, together with a sum of $3,792.54,
received from the sale of publications, and from miscellaneous sources,
made the total receipts $57,972.54.

The total expenditure during the year was $48,755.05, for the details
of which reference is made to the report of the executive committee.
The unexpended balance on June 30, 1893, was $57,092.82, which
includes the sum of $10,000 referred to in previous reports, $5,000 hay-
ing been received from the estate of Dr. Kidder, and a like sum from
Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, the latter a gift made personally to the
Secretary to promote certain physical investigations.
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

This latter sum was, with the donor’s consent, deposited by the Sec-
retary to the credit of the current funds of the Institution.

This $10,000 is not, then, a portion of the invested funds, but is held
partly to erect a building whenever Congress shall provide a site for
a permanent Astrophysical Observatory, and partly to meet antici-
pated expenditures in certain investigations.

This balance also includes the interest accumulated on the Hodgkins
donation and on the Hamilton fund, which is awaiting the Regents’
disposition, besides certain relatively considerable sums held to meet
obligations which may be expected to mature as the result of different
scientific investigations or publications in progress.

The Institution has been charged with the disbursement, during the
fiscal year 189293, of the following appropriations:

All vouchers and checks for the disbursements have been examined
by the executive committee, and the expenditures will be found reported
in accordance with the provisions of the sundry civil act of October
2, 1888, in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the House of Repre-
sentatives.

The vouchers for all the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund
proper have been likewise examined and their correctness certified to
by the executive committee, whose statement will be published together
with the accounts of the funds appropriated by Congress, in that com-
mittee’s report.

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, for carrying
on the Government interests under the charge of the Smithsonian
Institution, were as follows:

With regard to the general expenditures of the Institution, it may
be remarked that those for clerical services and for incidental expen-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 5

ses have for the last seven years, owing to increasing economies, been
diminishing until they are now considerably less in proportion to the
amount administered than at any former time. It is doubtful whether
these economies can be advantageously pushed any further, as it has
become difficult, with the present force, to keep abreast of the actual
current demands, and there has been no considerable renewal of the
perishable furnitures of the building during the period mentioned. It
seems probable, therefore, that the proportionate cost of these items
is not likely to be again lower than it is at present.

BUILDINGS.

It may perhaps seem superfluous, in consideration of the serious
reductions that have been made in the appropriations for the current
expenses of the Museum, to repeat my recommendation that more
adequate accommodations should be provided for it by the erection of a
new and thoroughly fireproof building, but while this is needed for
many reasons, the repetition is opportune now, since valuable material
may come to the Museum at the close of the World’s Columbian Expo-
sition in Chicago, and because if there are storage and exhibition rooms
available, many exhibitseat Chicago may be secured, which it will
otherwise perhaps be necessary to refuse.

I must repeat what I have stated in previous reports, that since the
present Museum building was finished and occupied in 1881, the col-
lections have increased to such an extent that a new building quite as
large as the present one could have been advantageously filled, and
that the need grows yet more pressing.

The improvement of buildings in the Zoological Park to the limited
extent that the appropriations allowed, is detailed in the report of the
acting manager.

REPAIRS TO THE SMITHSONIAN BUILDING.

A restrictive clause contained in the appropriation of August 30,
1890, for repairs to the Smithsonian building was removed by a clause
in the sundry civil act for the year ending June 30, 1894, so that a por-
tion of the amount unexpended became available for making neces-
sary repairs to the roof of the eastern wing and improving the sanitary
condition of the building, as well as for increasing the space available
for storing documents and handling the Government exchanges. The
plumbing in the eastern part of the building has been thoroughly over-
hauled, and a suite of dark and damp rooms in the basement on the
south side has been transformed into well-lighted and comfortable
offices, thus freeing several rooms upon the first floor, needed for other
purposes, and making it possible to handle more expeditiously the
great number of books passing through the exchange office; though
even with these new rooms, additional storeroom for the Government
exchanges will be called for at no distant day.
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

It may be of interest to note that a mark was placed, by my direction,
at the side of the window of the northeast corner room in the base-
ment of the Smithsonian building, 51 feet above the datum plane used
by the engineer office of the District of Columbia, situated at the cor-
ner of Fifteenth and B streets NW., or about 19.87 feet above the
highest flood mark recorded, that of June 2, 1859.

RESEARCH.

It appears to be an essential portion of the original scheme of the
government of the Institution that its Secretary should be expected
toadvance knowledge, whether in letters, or in science, by personal
research; and resolutions of the Regents formally request the Secre-
tary to continue his investigations in physical science, and to present
their results for publication in the Smithsonian ‘“ Contributions.”

The advancement of science through original research at the hands
of those eminent men, Henry and Baird, the former Secretaries of this
Institution, is known to all, but though the Secretary may be still
expected to personally contribute to the advancement of science, or art,
or letters, by his individual efforts, it is certain that the increasing
demands of time for labors of administration, had greatly limited the
possibility of this, even in the time of Henry, and that at the present
day administrative duties, and especially those connected with the care
of Government interests, constitute a barrier to such investigations,
which is all but impassable.

I have never abandoned, however, the hope to thus continue the tra-
dition of the Institution and the usage of former Secretaries by person-
ally contributing, as far as I could, to the objects stated, and I have,
where administrative duties would permit, continued during the pres-
ent year the researches, of which a portion has been published, in
August, 1891, in a treatise entitled “ Experiments in Aerodynamics.”
Interesting results have since been reached here, which appear to be of
wide utilitarian importance, but though I trust, before the close of
another year, to be able to make some communication of them to the
public, they are not yet complete.

In this same connection, in pursuit of an investigation begun some
years ago, and in continuation of the Institution’s interest in the
promotion of meteorological studies, I have made experiments upon the
variations continually going on in the atmosphere, in what is regarded
for ordinary meteorological purposes as a steady wind. Specially
light anemometers have been constructed and mounted upon the
north tower of the Smithsonian building, and connected with a suit-
able recording apparatus. The results, which promise conclusions of
practical importance, are being collated and will be published at a later
date. Iam under obligations to the Chief of the U.S. Weather Bureau
for the loan of a portion of these anemometers, the others having been
constructed in the small workshop of the Institution.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7

I have continued to give what time and thought I can to investiga-
tions in astro-physics, which are so extensive and, I hope, so important,
as to justify a considerable separate mention under the title, Astro-
physical Observatory, in the Appendix of this report.

In what I have said I have principally referred to research in the
physical sciences, since aid to original research in the biological sei-
ences has been largely, though indirectly, provided through -the
Institution’s connection with the National Museum and otherwise. It
would, therefore, seem proper that what aid to scientific men can be
given from the original Smithsonian fund should be principally devoted
to the physical sciences, which are not otherwise cared for.

As in previous years, aid to a limited extent has been given to
original investigators who are not immediately connected with the
Institution. Prof. E. W. Morley has continued his determinations of
the density of oxygen and hydrogen, for which special apparatus has
been provided by the Institution.

A paper by Prof. A. A. Michelson, upon the “Application of interfer-
ence methods to spectroscopic measurements,” with a view to increased
precision in measuring specific wave-lengths of light, has been published
in connection with his work upon a universal standard of length. Mr.
F. L. O. Wadsworth was detached from the Observatory staff, and sent
(at the expense of the Smithsonian fund) to the Bureau Internationale
des Poids et Mésures near Paris to assist Prof. Michelson during a stay
of six weeks in the preparation of this standard.

Prof. Holden, the director of the Lick Observatory, Mount Hamilton,
Cal., is still engaged in lunar photography, for which some occasional
ail has been given in previous years by the Institution.

The subscription for twenty copies of the Astronomical Journal,
which are distributed abroad as exchanges of the Institution, has
been continued.

In the Astro-physical Observatory the investigations of radiant
energy alluded to in my previous reports have been continued, and
very interesting results have been obtained. I have referred, on
another page, somewhat at length to the work of the Observatory,
and further details are contained in the report in the Appendix.

The Hodgkins researches have already promised to assume such
importance that they have also been given a special place upon a
later page of the present report.

EXPLORATIONS.

Iam much gratified to report the safe return of Mr. W. W. Rockhill
from his dangerous journey in Tibet. His explorations have added
much to our knowledge of these regions, and a portion of the collection
he has made will eventually be placed in the National Museum. Mr.
Reekhill is now engaged upon the preparation of a special report of
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

his journey, which will be published in the Miscellaneous Collections
of the Institution, while a brief popular abstract of his paper is now
in print and will form a part of the Appendix to the Annual Report of
the Regents for the year ending June 30, 1892, soon to be issued.

The principal other explorations of the Institution have been made
through the Bureau of Ethnology, to the report of whose Director the
reader is referred.

PUBLICATIONS.

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.—The quarto series of publi-
cations under this title, inaugurated by the Institution in 1548, has
always been regarded as the most important of its issues—not merely by
priority in date, but as including only memoirs of extended original
investigations and researches, advancing what are believed to be new
truths, and constituting therefore positive additions to human knowl-
edge.

The hope of its originator—the first Secretary—to be able to send
forth a quarto volume annually (after the practice of the Royal Society
of London), has not been realized; partly from the insufficiency of
material presented judged worthy of the position, partly from the cost.

Volume xxvii of the ‘Contributions to Knowledge” has been
issued during the year, consisting entirely of a memoir entitled “ Life
Histories of North American Birds, with special reference to their
breeding habits and eggs,” by Capt. Charles E. Bendire (U.S. Army,
retired), honorary curator of the odlogical collections in the U. S.
National Museum. This somewhat elaborate work is illustrated with
well-executed chromo-lithographic plates of birds’ eggs, representing
eight families and over 100 different species. It has been received with
exceptional favor by European as well as by American men of science.

Another memoir published during the year, which, though brief,
is regarded as an important scientific “contribution,” is a discussion, by
Prof. A. A. Michelson, of ‘the application of interference methods to
spectroscopic measurements,” with a view to an increased precision in
measuring specific wave-lengths of light, which may ultimately be em-
ployed as fixed standards of comparison for units of linear metrology.

_ Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.—Of this series two volumes
have been issued during the year, Volumes XXXIV and XxxxvI, the
former comprising a collection of ten articles previously published
separately.

The latter consists of a new bibliography of chemistry for the past
four hundred years, a work of remarkable research by Dr. Henry Car-
rington Bolton, extending to more than 1,200 octavo pages.

Volume xxxv of this series has not yet been completed, though the
first contribution thereto has been issued, namely, a volume of “ Smith-
sonian meteorological tables” of over 300 pages. It forms the first
of three projected volumes of tables—(A) meteorological, (B) geograph-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. : $

ical, (C) physical—designed to supersede the tables of Dr. Guyot, first
published by this Institution in 1852, which have had so wide and so
useful a currency, but which are now so far out of date thatit seems
better to replace than to revise and reprint them.

Smithsonian Annual Reports.—The report of the U. 8. National
Museum to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution for the year
ending June 30, 1890, has only been received from the printer this year,
The Smithsonian Report for the year ending June 30, 1891, as well as the
Museum Report for the same period, have not yet been received from
the Government Printing Office.

Reports of the Bureau of Ethnology.—The Seventh Annual Report of
the Director of the Bureau of Ethnology to the Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution, published during the year, maintains the usual char-
acter of excellence.

LIBRARY.

The plan detailed in my report for 188788 for increasing the acces-
sions to the library and for completing the series of scientiffe journals
already in possession of the Institution has been continued, with grati-
fiying results. Since the plan was first put in operation 1,550 new peri-
odicals have been added to the list and 909 defective series have been
either completed or filled out as far as the publishers were able to sup-
ply missing parts.

The reading room no longer has sufficient accommodations for the
growing exchanges of the Institution, nor for the persons desiring to
consult this important collection of current scientific literature.

Ever since 1890 I have called attention in my reports to the fact that
the present quarters of the library are insufficient, the natural expan-
sion of the library having been prevented by the fact that the rooms
adjacent to it were occupied by the international exchanges. . It will
be possible shortly to assign other quarters to the exchanges, and plans
have been prepared for book shelves and a gallery in one of the rooms
made vacant. It is estimated that space will thus be secured for about
6,000 volumes.

Mr. John Murdoch, whose resignation as librarian was referred to in
my last report, was succeeded in charge of the library on July 16, 1892,
by Mr. J. Elfreth Watkins.

Mr. Watkins on October 1, 1892, resigned his position, and on Decem-
ber 1, 1892, Dr. Cyrus Adler, of the Johns Hopkins University, was
appointed to fill the vacancy. Dr. Adler’s report on the library for the
year is given in Appendix IV.

The Institution has possessed for many years a number of costly
illustrated works of art, engravings and etchings, which were acquired
by the Regents, by purchase, of the late Mr. Marsh, our minister at
Rome. These were understood to have been temporarily deposited with
the Library of Congress for safekeeping in 1874. Some correspondence
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

with regard to them took place between the Secretary and the Librarian
on May 10 of the present year, from which it appears that the bound
volumes are, in general, accessible, but that a large portion of the un-
bound engravings which the catalogue—an imperfect one,—appears to
call for,—can not at present be found, nor is it, indeed (owing to the im-
perfection of the present catalogue and lists), yet certain that all of these
were in fact sent to the Library of Congress.

I mention in connection with the expression of the interest that the
Institution is intended to take in art, the fact that the Regents, at their
meeting of October, 1891, having instructed the Secretary to cause
to be painted a portrait of Mr. Hodgkins, he placed the execution of this
in the hands of Mr. Robert Gordon Hardie, who produced (though aided
only by a photograph and a description given by friends) a portrait of
Mr. Hodgkins both valuable as a work of art and singularly true as a
likeness. This was submitted to the Regents at their meeting in Janu-
ary, and received their general approbation.

In this same connection it may be observed that the portrait of Henry,
executed by the Regents’ instructions in former years, was sent to
form a portion of the Smithsonian exhibit at the World’s Fair in Chi-
cago.

THE HODGKINS FUND.

As stated in the Secretary’s Report for 1892, the gift to the Smith-
sonian Institution of $200,000 by Mr. Thomas George Hodgkins, of
Setauket, N. Y., was formally accepted at a special meeting of the Board
of Regents on the 21st of October, 1891.

On the 23d of the same month Mr. Hodgkins added to his will a
codicil making the Smithsonian Institution his residuary legatee, but
the sum thus added to the original gift will not, it is understood, be —
considerable.

The committee appointed to advise upon matters connected with the
Hodgkins foundation* submitted the followmg circular, which was
approved, and published in March, 1892, and has since then been
widely distributed, more than 8,000 copies having been sent throughout
the world to learned institutions and to investigators, and, on request,
to all expressing themselves interested in the researches which, in
accordance with the wish of the founder, it is the design to have
specially furthered by the income from the Hodgkins fund.

CIRCULAR CONCERNING THE HODGKINS FUND PRIZES.

In October, 1891, Thomas George Hodgkins, Esq., of Setauket, N. Y.,
made a donation to the Smithsonian Instit tion, the income from a
part of which was to be devoted ‘to the increase and diffusion of more

exact knowledge in regard to the nature and properties of atmospheric
air in connection with the welfare of man.”

With the intent of furthering the donor’s wishes, the Smithsonian
Institution now announces the following prizes, to be awarded on or
atter July 1, 1894, should satisfactory papers be offered in competition:

(1) A prize of $10,000 for a treatise embodying some new and in-
portant discovery in regard to the nature or properties of atmospheric
air. These properties may be considered in their bearing upon any or
all of the sciences, e. g., not only in regard to meteorology, but in con-
nection with hygiene, or with any department whatever of biological
or physical knowledge.

(2) A prize of $2,000 for the most satisfactory essay upon (a) the
known properties of atmospheric air, considered in their relationships
to research in every department of natural science, and the importance
of a study of the atmosphere, considered in view of these relationships;
(b) the proper direction of future research, in connection with the im-
perfections of our knowledge of atmospheric air, and of the connections
of that knowledge with other sciences.

The essay, as a whole, should tend to indicate the path best calcu-
lated to lead to worthy results in connection with the future adminis-
tration of the Hodgkins foundation.

(3) A prize of $1,000 for the best popular treatise upon atmospheric
air, its properties and relationships (including those to hygiene, phys-
ical and mental). This essay need not exceed 20,000 words in length;
it should be written in simple language, and be suitable for publication
for popular instruction.

(4) A medal will be established, under the name of The Hodgkins
Medal of the Smithsonian Institution, which will be awarded annually
or biennially, for important contributions to our knowledge of the na-
ture and properties of atmospheric air, or for practical applications of
our existing knowledge of them to the welfare of mankind. This medal
will be of gold, and will be accompanied by a duplicate impression in
silver or bronze.

_ The treatises may be written in English, French, German, or Italian,
and should be sent to the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution,
Washington, before July 1, 1894, except those in competition for the
first prize, the sending of which nay be delayed until December 31, 1894.

The papers will be. examined and prizes awarded by a committee to
be appointed as follows: One member by the Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution; one member by the president of the National Acad-
emy of Sciences; one by the president pro tempore of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science; and the committee will
act together with the secretary of the Smithsonian Institution as mem-
ber ex officio. The right is reserved to award no prize if, in the judg-
ment of the committee, no contribution is offered of sufficient merit to

warrant an award. An advisory committee of not more than three
European men of science may be added at the discretion of the com-
mittee of award.

If no disposition be made of the first prize at the time now announced
the Institution may continue it until a later date, should it be made
evident that important investigations relative to its object are in prog-
ress, the results of which it is intended to offer in competition for the
prize. The Smithsonian Institution reserves the right to limit or modify
the conditions for this prize after December 1, 1894, should it be found
necessary. Should any of the minor prizes not be awarded to papers
sent in before July 1, 1894, the said prizes will be withdrawn from
competition.
ib? REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

A principal motive for offering these prizes is to call attention to the
Hodgkins fund and the purposes for which it exists, and accordingly
this circular is sent to the principal universities, and to all learned
societies known to the Institution, as well as to representative men of
science in every nation. Suggestions and recommendations in regard
to the most effective application of this fund are invited.

It is probable that special grants of money may be made to special-
ists engaged in original investigation upon atmospheric air and its
properties. Applications for grants of this nature should have the
indorsement of some recognized academy of sciences or other institu-
tion of learning, and should be accompanied by evidences of the
capacity of the applicant in the form of at least one memoir already
published by him, based upon original investigation.

To prevent misapprehension of the founder’s wishes it is repeated
that the discoveries or applications proper to be brought to the con-
sideration of the committee of award may be in the field of any
science or any art without restriction; provided only that they have to
do with “the nature and properties of atmospheric air in connection
with the welfare of man.”

Information of any kind desired by persons intending to become
competitors will be furnished on application.

All communications in regard to the Hodgkins fund, the Hodgkins
prizes, the Hodgkins medals, and the Hodg kins fund publications, or
applications for ‘erants of money, should be addressed to 8S. P. Langley,
Secretary of the. Smithsonian Institution, Washington, U.S. A.

[SEAL.} S. P. LANGLEY,

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

Washington, March 31, 1893.

Some desire being expressed for a more explicit declaration of the
scope of the investigations permitted by the Hodgkins foundation,
the following supplementary circular was issued in April, 1893, in further
explanation of the purport of the donor’s intentions:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
HODGKINS PRIZES.

WASHINGTON, April, 1893.

In answer to inquiries and in further explanation of statements made
in the Hodgkins circular, it may be added that any branch of natural
science may offer a subject of discussion for the Hodgkins prizes,where
this subject is related to the study of the atmosphere in connection
with the welfare of man.

Thus, the anthropologist may consider the history of man as affected
by climate through ‘the atmosphere; the geologist may study in this
special connection the crust of the earth, whose constituents and whose
form are largely modified by atmospheric influences; the botanist, the
atmospheric relations of the life of the plant; the electrician, the atmos-
pheric electricity; the mathematician and physicist, problems of aéro-
dynamics in their utilitarian application; and so on through the circle
of the natural se iences, both biological and physical, of which there is
perhaps not one which is necessarily excluded.

In explanation of the donor’s wishes, which the Institution desires
scrupulously to observe, it may be added that Mr. Hodgkins illus-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 13

trated the catholicity of his plan by citing the experiments of Franklin
in atmospheric electricity, and the work of the late Paul Bert upon
the relations of the atmosphere to life, as subjects for research, which,
in his own view, might be properly considered in this relationship.

While the wide range of the subjects which the founder’s purpose
makes admissible can not be too clearly stated, it is equally important
to emphasize the fact that the prizes in the different classes can be
awarded only in recognition of distinguished merit.

; S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary

Numerous applications, which are referred to the advisory committee
for consideration, have already been made for grants from the fund to
aid original investigations upon the nature of atmospheric air and its
properties. Two have been approved, a grant of $500 having been
made to Dr. O. Lummer and Dr. E. Pringsheim, members of the Phy-
sical Institute of the Berlin University, tor researches on the deter-
mination of an exact measure of the cooling of gases while expanding,
with a view to revising the value of that most important constant which
is technically termed the “gamma” function. Drs. Lummer and Pring-
sheim were recommended for this work by the eminent Professor Dr. H.
von Helmholtz, of Berlin.

A second grant of $1,000 has been made to Dr. J.S. Billings, U.S. A.,
Army Medical Museum, Washington, and to Dr. Weir Mitchell, of
Philadelphia, for an investigation into the nature of the peculiar sub-
stances of organic origin contained in the air expired by human beings,
with a specific reference to the practical application of the results
obtained to the problem of ventilation for inhabited rooms.

It is the intention that all applications for special grants shall be
thoroughly weighed by the committee first appointed, one of whose
functions it is to advise upon matters of this nature. They will then
be referred to the second, or committee of adjudication, for final action,
which shall be reached only after a comparative estimate of the value
of the researches proposed, and their relation to the object for which
the Hodgkins fund was established.

Numerous papers have already been submitted in competition tor the
prizes, all of which will be carefully examined and passed upon by the
committees before a final decision as to their merit can be reached.

The Secretary has under advisement the designs for the medal estab-
lished in connection with the Hodgkins competition, and which it has
been determined to award annually or biennially.

The death of Mr. Hodgkins occurred on the 25th of November, 1892,
- When he had reached the age of nearly 90 years. In this event the
Institution lost not only a generous benefactor but a friend whose
counsel was rendered valuable by the breadth of his views no less
than by the earnestness of his purpose to enlarge the domain of prac-
tical science in its relation to the welfare of man,
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
MISCELLANEOUS.

The Naples table—In the spring of 1895 a petition, signed by nearly
200 working biologists, who represented some eighty universities and
scientific institutions, was presented to me, asking that a table be
maintained by the Smithsonian Institution at the Naples Zoological
Station, for the benefit of American investigators.

This step, urged by su large a number of representative scientific
men, having been duly considered and favorably decided upon, the fol-
lowing letter was addressed to Dr. C. W. Stiles, of the American Mor-
phological Society, through whom the petition referred to reached me:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,
Washington, April 7, 1893.

DEAR Str: I have given careful consideration to the petitions and
papers presented by you, and I lave decided, in behalf of the Smith-
sonian Institution, to rent a table at the Naples Zoological Station for
three years, and have already taken steps to secure it.

I shall be glad to be able to learn the opinions of the representative
biologists of the United States in regard to the best administration of
this table, and I shall esteem it a favor if, through your mediation, an
advisory committee of four persons may be formed, one to be nomi-
nated by the president of the National Academy of Sciences, one by
the president of the American Society of Naturalists, one by the presi-
dent of the Morphological Society, and one by the president of the
Association of American Anatomists, with the understanding that I
may, if need arise, feel at liberty to ask their counsel in regard to the
regulations for the use of the table, or as to the merits of applicants
for it.

The table will be known as the Smithsonian table. Publications
resulting from its use will bear the name of the Smithsonian Institution,
and such of them as are of sufficient importance will probably be printed
in the Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge.

While the exact conditions will be determined later, I may say, sub-
ject to better advices, that it seems to me now that applications for
the use of the table should be made to the Secretary of the Institution,
who will probably desire to feel authorized to consult the above-men-
tioned committee concerning them whenever in his judgment occasion
arises for doing so.

If this meets your approval will you kindly communicate to the
president of each of the societies named my request that he nominate
a member of the advisory committee in question.

Very respectfully, yours,
S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary.
Dr C: NV. STULES:

Four members of an advisory committee were nominated in accord-
ance with my request, as follows:

Maj. John 8S. Billings, U. 8S. A., nominated by Prof. O. C. Marsh,
president of the National Academy of Sciences.

K. B. Wilson, PH. D., professor of zoology, Columbia University,
nominated by Prof. Chittenden, president of the Society of American
Naturalists.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

C. W. Stiles, PH. D., zoologist, Bureau of Animal Industry, U. S.
Department of Agriculture, nominated by Prof. C. O. Whitman, presi-
dent of the American Morphological Society.

John A. Ryder, PH. D., professor of en.oryology, University of
Pennsylvania, nominated by Prof. Allen, president of the Association
of American Anatomists.

These nominations having been approved, I designated Dr. J. 8.
Billings, U.S. A., chairman and Dr. C. W. Stiles secretary of the com-
mittee.

Satisfactory conditions as to the occupancy of the table were arranged
with Dr. Dohrn, the director of the station at Naples, and the follow-
ing contract was duly signed and completed:

{ Translation. ]

CONTRACT.

1. The director, Dr. A. Dohrn, places a study table in the laborato-
ries of the Zoological Station at Naples at the disposition of the Smith-
sonian Institution under the followin ¢ conditions and on the terms
stated in article 11 of this contract:

2. The table will be prepared for the occupancy of the student desig-
nated by the Smithsonian Institution within one week from the time
the administration shall have been advised of his arrival.

3. The table must be supplied with the objects enumerated below, as
follows:

(a) The principal chemical reagents;
(b) Instruments ordinarily needed in anatomy and microscopy;
(ec) Inplements for drawing.

The laboratories will be found provided with the more complicated
instruments and apparatus which are commonly used; these, however,
will be provided only in duplicate or in triplicate, while they are to
serve for the general use. The station does not provide optical instru-
ments for the “tables, it being understood that those who come there to
work are to furnish their own.

4, The table is supplied witha sufficient number of small aquaria with
flowing water, to serve for any experiments which the student may
need to make. i

5. The animals which are the object of the research, will be renewed
as often as possible, and according to the student’s needs. It will also
be practicable to have material prepared and preserved in known ways,
in order that the studies commenced at Naples may be continued else.
where.

6. The great aquarium attached to the Zoological Station will be
open gratis to the occupant of the table, either for his entertainment
or for his studies upon animal habits.

7. The library of the Zoological Station is in a hall adjacent to the
laboratories, and is accessible to the occupant of the table, who may use
it as a reading or a writing room.

8. The laboratories will be open at 7 o’clock in the morning in sum-
mer and 8 o’clock in winter. In exceptional cases, other arrangements
may be made with the administration, though the employés are not
obliged to open the laboratories before the given hour. From June 20
to August 20 the laboratories will be closed.
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

9, The occupant of the table will have the right to share in the fish-
ing expeditions sent out from the station, as well as to learn the different
methods in use.

10. Injuries to the instruments and utensils caused by the occupant
of the table, will be at the cost of the administration, so long as the
amount does not exceed 20 franes.

11. The present contract is for the term of three years, and the
Sinithsonian Institution promises to pay Dr. Anton Dohrn, the Direc-
tor of the Zoological Station, yearly in advance, the sum of 2,500 franes,
in gold, for the rent of the table in the laboratories of the Zoological
Station.

Signed in duplicate,

Washington, June 9, 1893.

S. P. LANGLEY,

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

Naples, May 16, 1893.
Professor Dr. ANTON DOHRN,

Director of the Zoological Station of Naples.

Numerous applications for the occupancy of the table have been
received, but at the close of the fiscal year sufficient consideration had
not been given them to render it possible to make any definite assign-
ment.

With a desire for the information necessary to a right administra-
tion of the affairs of the table, I have requested that all applications
shall be accompanied by credentials showing the qualifications of the
candidate to carry on original investigations in some field for which
especial facilities are offered at the Naples Station. These credentials
are to be accompanied by a scientific history of the candidate, together
with a list of such original papers as he may have published.

Those appointed to the table will be expected to make a report at
the end of their term of occupation, or, in case of a long residence at
the station, to submit such a report to the Institution every three
months.

Seal of the Institution—It having been found advisable that the
Institution should have a new seal, a device was prepared by Mr. St.
Gaudens, the eminent sculptor, whose esthetic value, as compared with
the one it replaced, is incontestable. One of the first uses of this seal
was to affix it to the circular concerning the Hodgkins gift, which has
just been referred to. Its use as the seal of the Institution was for-
mally recognized by the resolution of the Regents of January 25, 1893.

Lunar photography.—l have been interested for a considerable time
in the possibility of preparing a chart of the moon by photography,
which would enable geologists and selenographers to study its surface
in their cabinets with all the details before them which astronomers
have at command in the use of the most powerful telescopes.

Such a plan would have seemed chimerical a few years ago, and it is
still surrounded with difficulties, but it is probable that within a com-
paratively few years it may be successfully carried out. No definite
scale has been adopted, but it is desirable that the disk thus presented
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

should approximate in size one two-millionth of the lunar diameter;
but while photographs have been made on this scale, I do not think
that any of them show detail which may not be given on a smaller one.

I have been favored with the cooperation and interest in this work
of the directors of the Harvard College Observatory, of the Lick
Observatory, and others, who in response to a letter addressed to them
‘on February 10, 1893, have obliged me with many valuable sugges-
tions. This important work is still under advisement.

Delegates to universities and learned societies—The Smithsonian
Institution is not infrequently invited to send representatives to special
celebrations instituted by learned societies or universities with which it
is in correspondence both in this country and abroad. Whenever
practicable, special delegates have been designated by the Secretary to
represent the Institution on such occasions.

Dr. James C. Welling, president of the Columbian University and
Regent of the Smithsonian Institution, who was proceeding abroad as
a Commissioner of the United States to the Exposition at Madrid in
1892, was appointed delegate of the Smithsonian Institution to the
Tercentenary celebration of the founding of Trinity College of the Uni-
versity of Dublin, which took place on July 5-8, 1892.

Dr. George Vasey, botanist of the U. S. Department of Agriculture
and honorary curator of the department of botany in the U. 8.
National Museum, represented the Smithsonian Institution and the
National Museum at the Botanical Congress, Geneva, on the occasion
of the Columbian festivities, from the 4th to the 12th of September, 1892.

At the celebration of the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the
founding of the American Philosophical Society of Philadelphia, from
May 22 to May 26, 1893, the Smithsonian Institution was represented
by Prof. William C. Winlock, Assistant in char ge of office; Dr. Goode,
the Assistant Secretary, having been unable to attend.

Assignment of Rooms.—A room is still reserved in the basement for
the use of the officers of the U. S. Coast and Geodetic Survey for pen-
dulum experiments.

The American Historical Association.—The annual report of the
American Historical Association was on February 27, 1893, communi-
cated to Congress in accordance with the act approved January 4, 1889,
and the usual public document number of 1,900 copies was ordered
printed.

Stereotype plates and cuts.—The collection of stereotype plates of the
Smithsonian and Museum, and of engravers’ wood cuts and process
plates is now so large that its proper cataloguing and storage has
called for serious attention. It has always been the policy of the
Institution to permit the use of these plates by publishers under reason-
able conditions, and the requests for electrotype copies o* cuts have
grown more numerous. The original cuts are placed in the hands of

sm 93 2

18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

an engraver and electrotype copies are furnished at very small cost,
the expense being met by the applicant.

Special Smithsonian correspondent in Paris.—M. C. Reinwald & Co.,
15 rue des Saints-Péres, Paris, were designated, on June 6, 1893, as
special correspondents of the Smithsonian Institution, through whom
commissions can be conveniently attended to. I should add that no
compensation is attached to this agency.

Russian Physico-Chemical Society—I deem it not inappropriate
to give the following letter received June 29, 1892, from the Russian
Physico-Chemical Society:

St. PETERSBURG, May 31, 1892.
Russian Phyisco-Chemical Society University to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution at Washington:

The universal science reposes on the brotherhood of nations. The
United States of America in sending bread to the Russian people in
time of scarcity and need gave the most affecting instance of brotherly
feeling. The Russian chemists who devote themselves to the service of
universal science, at their meeting of the 7/19 of May decided to ask
their brethren of the Smithsonian Institute, to transmit the expression
of their sincere thanks to all persons or institutions who contributed
to the fulfillment of this brotherly aid.

President D. MENDELEEFF.
Secretary D. KONOWALOW.

A copy of this letter was communicated to the chairman of the Rus-
sian Famine Relief Committee and to the public press.

Correspondence.—Minor changes have been made in the methods of
handling correspondence, with a view to disposing of all letters with
the greatest dispatch compatible with the character of the work, and
the number of clerks that can be assigned to such duties. During the
preceding year a plan was adopted of separating the files in the Secre-
tary’s office according to the different branches of the work, inde-
pendent files being assigned to the Secretary’s correspondence con-
cerning the Smithsonian routine proper, the observatory, the museum,
the park, etc.; and with each file, separate press-copy books. The
files have been designated as follows:

1. Smithsonian proper.

2. The National Museum.

4, The Bureau of Ethnology.

5. The Zoological Park.

6. The Astro-physical Observatory.
11. Assistant in charge.

20. Aerodynamics.

25, Hodgkins fund.

A card index was begun on January 1, 1893, for both letters received
and letters written, to facilitate reference to the various files, and this
index will be Se tonded back to all letters since January 1, 1892, as
opportunity offers.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. i)5

Each letter of importance is registered as I have described in pre-
vious reports, and its course is traced until it is finally disposed of. In
addition to letters registered, many are forwarded directly to the
Museum, the Bureau of Ethnology, the Zoological Park, the Bureau
of International Exchanges, ete., for disposition. Many others, con-
cerning publications, are sent directly to the document room there to be
filed and accounted for. Referring now only to letters that are regis-
tered in the Secretary’s office, 3,184 entries were made for the fiscal
year 1892-93.

A further change in treating correspondence has gradually been
forced upon the Secretary, and with the object of obviating the neces-
sity of giving so much of his time. to matters of purely clerical routine,
a decision was finally reached, to delegate authority to the Assistant
in charge of office, to the acting Curator in charge of the Museum, and
to the Librarian, to sign routine letters bearing exclusively upon desig-
nated classes of correspondence. This has relieved the Secretary of
personally attending to correspondence of this class, without impairing
his proper supervision of official business.

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The Museum of the Smithsonian Institution, the nucleus of which
was Smithson’s cabinet of minerals, was formed in part, and for a time
entirely maintained, at the expense of the Smithson fund. Subse-
quently, at the bidding of Congress, the Institution assumed charge
of the so-called ‘“ National Cabinet of Curiosities,” which included
the collections of the United States exploring expedition; the collec-
tions of the National Institute founded in 1840, and numerous other
objects and collections which had accumulated under the charge of the
Commissioner of Patents. Tor thirty-five years these two series of
collections have been housed and cared for conjointly, and form the
nucleus of what is now known as the National Museu.

Each year since 1858 Congress has appropriated a certain sum of
money for the maintenance of the National Museum, but up to this
time it has not made any special provision for the improvement of
the collections by purchase, while it is becoming evident that those
received by gift or from other Government sources, though of consider-
able extent, are of rapidly diminishing consequence, since these things
are attaining each year a higher and higher market value, and are
tending to be commanded only by purchase.

In respect of this provision for purchase, the National Museum stands
at the foot of all American museums, being surpassed even by every
municipal museum of note with which I am acquainted.* The disad-

*The American Museum of Natural History, for example, expended $23,552.89 for
additions to its natural history collections during 1892, while the National Museum,
which is of very much wider scope, expended only $5,769.75 during the fiscal year
1892-93, for collections of all kinds,
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

vantage in which it stands, when compared with what are now its com-
petitors in the national collections of the leading countries of Europe,
has grown painfully obvious. Important collections made in this coun-
try of the objects illustrating the vanishing iife of its own native races
of men and animals—collections which can never be made again, and
never be replaced—are being permanently withdrawn to enrich the
museums of Europe. This has already gone so far that it is necessary
in order to study the past life of our own Mississippi Valley to go to
England, while for that of southern Alaska we must go to Berlin, and
for the Californian coast we must go to Paris, and so on. It is already
then, in European capitals more than in our own, that we have to go
for some of the most important studies of our native races; and at the
present rate, within a few more years, when the American collector
has nothing more left to gather and to sell abroad, it will be in Europe
and notin America that the student of past American history must
seek for nearly everything that most fully illustrates the ancient lite
and peoples of the American continent.

This is an exceedingly regrettable cireumstance and one which I sin-
cerely hope the National Legislature will be disposed to modify. I may
remark in this connection that the National Museum is in danger of
forfeiting its proper status also on account of the competition of private
collections. With the increase of wealth in the country the desire for
the establishment of museums in various cities has been realized
and the amount spent for objects in many of them is far greater than
the National Museum has ever had at its disposal. While the National
Museum has always desired to cooperate fully with private establish-
ments of like nature, it is felt that the scientific and educational collec-
tion of the Government should be in nowise inferior.

During the past year the Museum has been, as hitherto, under the
charge of Dr. G. Brown Goode, the Assistant Secretary of the Institu-
tion. Mr. Frederick W. True was designated by me curator-in-charge,
and has assumed the general management of the. Museum at different
times during the absence of the Assistant Secretary.

A full report upon the operations of the Museum has been prepared
by Dr. Goode, and will form a separate volume, of which an abstract
is given here later.

The Museum has been engrossed during the year in completing the
preparations for the exhibits at the World’s Columbian Exposition,
and this work caused the practical suspension of many regular oper-
ations. The exhibits were ready at the appointed time and were
installed in the Government building in the Exposition by the curators
of the Museum, under the direction of the Assistant Secretary, who was
the representative of the Institution on the Government board.

A statement regarding the exhibits of the Museum will be found in
the report of the Assistant Secretary.

In connection with this work mention should be made of the Colum-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 7A

bian Historical Exposition held in Madrid in the fall and winter of
1892. This Exposition was a part of the very extensive celebration of
the four hundredth anniversary of the sailing of Columbus, held in the
various cities of Spain under the direction of the Spanish Government.
A commission was appointed by the President to represent the United
States, consisting of Rear Admiral Luce, U.S. N., Dr. J. C. Welling,
one of the regents of this Institution,* and Mr. Goode, its Assistant
Secretary, and a liberal appropriation made for the expenses of trans-
portation and maintenance of the exhibits. Extensive collections were
sent by the Smithsonian Institution, taken from its own collections
and borrowed from its collaborators and correspondents. They were.
ethnological, archeological, and historical, and were supplemented by
other collections sent by the University of Pennsylvania, the Bureau
of American Republics, and the Hemenway Expedition. The exhibi-
tion in Madrid was as a successful one, and the exhibit of the United
States was highly appreciated by the Spanish Government, and led to
its extraordinarily generous participation in the subsequent celebra-
tion in Chicago. Gold medals were awarded to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, to the Museum, and the Bureau of Ethnology.

The Museum building has been visited by a larger number of persons
during the past year than ever betore, the total number exceeding 300,000.
This growing interest in the collections on the part of the public, is a
eratifying circumstance, and leads to the belief that the care bestowed
upon the exhibition series is not unappreciated.

On account of the crowded condition of the exhibition halls, the
effective display of many of the collections of the Museum is prevented.
The proper lighting of the cases is interfered with and the arrange-
ment of the specimens is necessarily less systematic than is desirable.

The Museum has continued to distribute to educational establish-
ments throughout the country such collections of duplicate natural-
history specimens as it has been found practicable to prepare. Some-
what more than 13,000 specimens have been sent out during the year.
These, however, have been far from sufficient to meet the demands of
applicants and numerous requests remain unacted upon. I regard
this distribution of specimens as one of the most important operations
of the Museum, and one on which much more time and money could be
profitably spent. With the resources available it has been impossible
to prepare collections in more than a few lines, and these have all been
more or less imperfect. The high schools of the country, to which such
collections would be of much value, can not at present be supplied.

My attention has been called bythe Assistant Secretary to the inade-
quate size of the editions of the publications of the Museum. It is not
at present possible to supply all the larger libraries of the world, and
the majority of the smaller ones, in many of which they would be of

high utility, are entirely unprovided. Individuals do not receive the
volumes at all, but only such papers extracted from them as relate to
the scientific work in which they are immediately concerned. It is
much to be desired that larger editions should be provided for.

During the year two volumes of the Proceedings and one complete
number and parts of another number of the Bulletin were published.

The Museum has been benefited, as in previous years, by the co-
operation of the several Departments and Bureaus of the Government.
Special mention should be made in this connection of the many cour-
tesies received from the consular service of the Department of State.
The Quartermaster’s Department of the Army has assisted materi-
‘ally by providing transportation for bulky collections coming to the
National Museum from remote localities. The Museum has further
been able to avail itself of the services of officials of the Navy Depart-
ment, Department of Agriculture, the U. 8. Geological Survey, and
U.S. Fish Commission, who have acted in the capacity of honorary
curators.

BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY.

The researches of the Bureau of Ethnology relating to the American
Indians were continued during the year in accordance with law, under
the direction of Maj. J. W. Powell, who also directed the work of the
U.S. Geological Survey.

As during previous years the work of the Bureau has been con-
ducted with special reference to the American Indians in their primitive
condition, with a view of securing the largest possible amount of infor-
mation, both in the form of records for print and in the form of mate-
rial objects for preservation and future study in the National Museum.
Thus extensive collections are made annually, and the value of these
collections is greatly enhanced by reason of the full notes always pre-
pared and the extended publications sometimes made by the colleet-
Ors.

The non-material collections of data relating directly to the native
Americans, to the distribution of tribes, to their habits and customs,
to their arts, languages, institutions, and beliefs, are also abundant
and, it is believed, of permanent value. Detailed information on these
subjects is published in three series of reports additional to the
abstracts appearing in the Report of the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution. The thirty volumes already published form a rich store-
house of facts relating to our native races. Four volumes were added
to this library during the year.

One of the most interesting questions ever raised concerning the
early peoples of this country related to the artificial mounds scattered
abundantly over the Mississippi Valley and with less abundance over
most of our territory. Many investigators have given attention to
these works of a vanished race; and it came to be a general opinion
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

that the builders of the mounds were a distinct people ante-dating the
native races found in possession of the land on the advent of the Euro-
peans. Within the last five years extended surveys of the mound
territory have been made by collaborators of the Bureau under imme-
diate instructions from the Director and by Dr. Cyrus Thomas. An
elaborate report on this subject has been prepared during the year
and is now in press. It is the united opinion of the officers of the
Bureau that this document contains the solution to the mystery of the
mounds; very greatly to the surprise of the investigators who began
the work, they have been led to believe that the mounds and the art
products contained therein are in no wise distinct from the works of
the modern Indians, and that the distribution of tribes can now be
studied from the mounds themselves as well as from other aboriginal
records.

The work of the Bureau on Archeology or prehistoric arts has been
conducted with energy and exceptional success. Until recently many
ot the leading students of American antiquities were Europeans; and
thus it happened that the classification of American art products was
to a large extent an imported one, corresponding to foreign generali-
zations and ideals rather than to any indigenous standard. Thus a
history of succession of peoples, representing increasing grades of cul-
ture, has been wrought out. As will be seen from the reports of the
Director and collaborators of the Bureau, however, an indigenous clas-
sification has been also developed by it, and it has been shown to be
probable that the objects supposed to represent the series of culture
stages are in most cases at least the handiwork of single tribes during
the same epoch. These researches were conducted chiefly by Prof.
W. H. Holmes, with the assistance of Messrs. Fowke and Dinwiddie.
If these important results obtain general acceptance, the effect will be
to shorten the earlier estimates of the antiquity of man on this conti-
nent, and in this respect it will be observed that they are coincident
with those flowing from the mound researches.

Important investigations concerning the beliefs of the Indians of
different parts of the country have been conducted during the year,
notably by Mrs. M. C. Stevenson and Mr. F. H. Cushing among the
Zunis, and Dr. Hoffman among the remnants of the Lake Superior
tribes. An elaborate memoir by the first-named collaborator was sent
to press during the year.

The principal work relating to the sociology or institutions of the
aborigines was that of continuing the preparation of a tribal synonymy
or dictionary of tribal names, including not only those names applied
by white men, but the names current among the Indians themselves.
Connected with this work is a detailed study of the literature relating
to the Indian languages by Mr. James Constantine Pilling. The results
of this study form a bibliography which has already come to be recog:
nized as a standard by the bibliographic students of the world.
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

An important line of investigation related to the means of interchang-
ing ideas among our native races, including gesture, speech, and pic-
ture writing, as well as spoken language. The primitive modes of
expression by means of gestures or pantomime and by means of glyphs
or pictures are held by students as of special interest, in that they repre-
sent the beginnings of language. These modes of conveying ideas have
received much attention by collaborators of the Bureau, notably Col.
Garrick Mallery. An elaborate memoir on the “ Picture writing of the
American Indians” is incorporated in the tenth annual report of the
Bureau. This memoir is a practically exhaustive monograph on the
subject to which it relates; the illustrations, which number nearly
fourteen hundred, represent the aboriginal picture writing of all por-
tions of the country with fidelity, while the meanings of the glyphs are
interpreted and discussed in detail in the text. A large body of
material relating to the sign language of the aborigines has been col-
lected, and during the year progress was made in arranging this
material for publication. Inno other part of the world have the oppor-
tunities for collecting detailed information concerning primitive modes
of expression been so favorable as in North America; and it is thought
that these reports prepared by collaborators of the Bureau, will serve
at once as a record of past and passing races and a basis for philological
researches in other countries.

The spoken languages of various tribes of Indians were studied and
recorded. One of the most extensive aboriginal linguistic families was
the Siouan, including the Indians of the northern plains from the Rocky
Mountains to the Mississippi, and from the Saskatchewan nearly to the
Red River of the South. One of the publications of the year was a
“Dakota-English Dictionary,” in which the language of the best-known
division of the Siouan family is made accessible to students, this work,
begun by the late Dr. Riggs, being completed by Mr. J. Owen Dorsey,
a linguist especially familiar with the languages of this stock. The
dictionary forms a quarto volume of nearly seven hundred pages. The
language of the Biloxi Indians of Louisiana was also investigated during
the year by Mr. Dorsey; Dr. Gatschet made a detailed study of the
Peoria, Shawnee, Arapaho, and Cheyenne languages in Indian Terri-
tory, the work on the Peoria being complete with respect to both
vocabulary and grammar.

The Iroquoian languages also were the subject of study by Mr. J. N.
B. Hewitt. Unwritten language is one of the most evanescent of human
characters; already the languages of many of our native tribes have
entirely disappeared, save for a few greatly modified terms preserved
as geographic names; and it seems especially important to record the
rapidly changing native languages thus far remaining. Some of the
vocabularies and grammars collected by the Bureau were derived from
half a dozen or fewer individuals who alone represent their tribe; in
one case (the Chinooken) the language was preserved through infor-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

mation obtained from the last representative of his people. A large
part of the publications of the Bureau relate to aboriginal languages;
yet the more or less fragmentary material, incomplete but constantly
growing, relating to this subject is still more voluminous; and students
of linguistics throughout the world are to be congratulated on the
existence of this rich storehouse of material collected through the labors
of the Smithsonian Institution and of the Bureau of Ethnology.

In addition to the researches in field and office several collaborators
of the Bureau were employed during the closing months of the year in
preparing an ethnologic exhibit for the World’s Columbian Exposition
at Chicago. This exhibit was completed and installed duly; and it is
a source of gratification to be able to say that it proves constantly
attractive to visitors, and it is believed to have been also highly
instructive.

The details of the work of the Bureau are set forth in the report of
the Director, Maj. J. W. Powell, which forms the accompanying Appen-
dix II.

SMITHSONIAN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE.

The International Exchange Service has always been intimately
connected with the parent institution, which has until lately aided it
largely from its private funds, and which still aids it by giving it rooms
rent free and in other ways.

It may be said to be at present upon as satisfactory a basis as it seems
possible to place it with the appropriations that are now made by Congress.

As an illustration of the extent of this special part of the Institution’s
activities, it may be stated that it has now about 24,000 active corre-
spondents, of whom 14,000 are in Europe, 200 in Africa, 500 in Australia,
and about 9,000 in the various countries of the Western Hemisphere.
In the course of this work the Institution has gathered at Washington
an immense collection of books, found nowhere else to so great an
extent, bearing chiefly upon discovery and invention, which, with others,
now occupy nearly 300,000 titles. These are deposited temporarily with
the National Library at the Capitol.

The details of the operations of the service are to be found in the
curator’s report appended. Improvements in the service are needed in
an increase in the clerical force for office work, or rather a return to the
number employed in 1891-92. There is need also for securing a more
prompt dispatch and distribution of packages abroad, which can only
be brought about by an increase of appropriation.

The United States Government is under treaty obligation to maintain
an exchange service with ten foreign countries, and with France, Eng-
land, and Germany a special exchange arrangement is in existence. In
the two latter countries, where there are paid agents of the Institution,
and in other countries where official exchange bureaus have been estab-
lished the transmission of publications, while somewhat slow, is gene-
rally efficient. In other cases, however, the present arrangement is by
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

no means satisfactory, and it seems desirable, either through diplomatic
channels or through a special representative of the Institution sent
abroad, to secure the interest and cooperation of the foreign govern-
ments and the learned societies where no official exchange bureau has
been established.

The greater part of the expense of the service is now met by direct
appropriation for the purpose by Congress to the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. A part of the expense is also met by appropriations to different
Government bureaus from their contingent funds, the Regents of the
Institution having decided to make a charge to all Government bureaus
of 5 cents per pound weight for the transmission of their publications
or for the publications received for them from abroad.

Special acknowledgments are due to the Treasury Department for
designating one of its officers at the New York custom-house to receive
and transmit to Washington the international exchange cases addressed
to the Institution, and I may in this connection again quote the remark
made by Prof. Henry in his report for 1854:

There is, therefore, no port to which the Smithsonian packages are
shipped where duties are charged on them, a certified invoice of con-
tents by the Secretary being sufficient to pass them through the eustom-
house free of duty. On the other hand, all packages addressed to the
Institution arriving at the ports of the United States are admitted
without detention, duty free.

By referring to the report of the curator, in the appendix, it will be
seen that over 100 tons of books passed through the exchange office
during the fiscal year 189293, and while the service is used almost exclu-
Sively for the transmission of printed matter of a scientific nature, nat-
ural history specimens, having no commercial value, are occasionally
transmitted under special permission, when they can not be conveniently
forwarded by the ordinary means of conveyance.

The expenditures for the year have been $18,518.25, of which $17,000
were appropriated by Congress, $1,396.64 were paid by Government
bureaus, $87.35 by State institutions and others, leaving a deficiency
of $34.26.

The amount estimated for the exchange bureau for the year 189394
was $23,000, a sum which it was hoped would render it unnecessary to
call upon the different Government Departments for a part of the
expense attending the transmission of their publications, and would
also render it possible to put into effect a second treaty entered into by
the United States and other countries at the same time as the treaty
referred to above, by which each country undertook to distribute its
parliamentary proceedings immediately when issued. On account of a
lack of appropriations for this purpose no action has yet been taken by
the United States for carrying out this latter agreement.

In my report for 1890 I stated that there had been expended from the
Smithsonian fund for the support of the international exchange sys-
tei, in the interests and by the authority of the National Government,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 2

$38,141.01 in excess of appropriations, advanced from January 1, 1868,
to June 30, 1886, for the exchange of official Government documents,
and $7,054.81 in excess of appropriations from July 1, 1886, to June 30.
1889, advanced for the purpose of carrying out a convention entered
into by the United States, or an aggregate of $45,175.82, which has
been paid from the private fund of James Smithson, for purely govern-
mental expenses. This has still to be reimbursed to the Institution.
A memorandum in regard to the matter was duly transmitted to a
member of the Board of Regents, in the House of Representatives, for
the purpose of taking the necessary steps to procure a return by Con-
gress to the Smithsonian fund of this last-mentioned sum, namely,
$45,175.82, but I am not aware that action has been taken upon it.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

It should always be remembered that the establishment * of the
National Zoological Park resulted largely from a desire to keep from
extinction species of American animals, several of which are now
upon the point of vanishing from the face of the earth, and will vanish
forever if something is not done at once to preserve them.

The paramount need of preserving these races by immediate legis-
lative action, if they are to be preserved at all, the great and con-
stantly increasing difficulty of obtaining specimens of some of them,
the little that is known of their habits, and the impossibility of ever
learning more, unless some immediate measures are taken to make
careful observation possible, render it exceedingly desirable that such
measures should be taken officially, and no more economical or effective
plan could be devised than that of providing a moderate extent of land,
near the seat of Government, duly protected and guarded, where such
animals as could be secured might be kept in a state as near as pos-
sible to that to which they had been accustomed, and under econdi-
tions where they might be expected to breed, and continue their spe-
cies, as they are known not to do in ordinary menageries.

It was not indeed thought that any efficient check could be given
to the final extinction of these animals solely by such a limited num-
ber as could be thus preserved, but it was considered that Sxeir pres-
ence here at the Capital would be not only useful as regarded the num-
ber saved, but as a constant object lesson, under the eyes of the leg-
islature, and in this way, a most important adjunct to the larger reser-
vations like the Yellowstone Park; while it was evident that oppor-
tunity could thus be afforded to study and observe their habits and
characteristics, where they were under the eyes of the numerous natu-
ralists in the Government service, in a more satisfactory manner than
would be possible in a remote wilderness.

The act providing for the purchase and creation of the National
Zoological Park introduced also a subordinate feature, that of the

Reference may be made to the following pages in the Annual Reports of the
Smithsonian Institution: Report for 1888, p. 42; for 1889, p. 27; for 1890, p. 34, and

28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

recreation of the people, but by placing one-half of the expense of
purchase and maintenance upon the taxpayers of the District, Con-
egress in fact, though presumably not in intent, made this subordinate
feature predominant in a plan whose inception arose in a simpler and
more utilitarian idea.

This predominance arose from the natural wish of the local taxpayer
tu receive entertainment for his money and not to spend it for objects
of remote and national importance. This demand must be admitted to
have been but reasonable, from the point of view of residents of the
District, and it made itself felt through Congress in many ways, if not
through the terms of formal legislation.

Those to whom was delegated the power of carrying out the man-
dates of Congress were thus confronted by a different task from that
originally contemplated: by one in some way not consonant with it, and
by a far more expensive one. In place, for instance, of the large inex-
pensive paddocks for inclosing and sheltering the animals under the
conditions of wild life, and secluding them with the aimof enabling them
to increase in the undisturbed retirement necessary, must be substi-
uted comparatively expensive buildings, with the opposite aim of exhib-
iting the animals obtained. A system of roadways that should afford the
public access to all parts of the park where animals are kept had to be
devised, and in ways too numerous for detail the necessity was imposed
of forming the National Zoological Park more on the model of an ordi-
inary zoological garden than of the first large and simple idea.

It was impossible to do this within the sum calculated to carry out
the original plans, but no more has been granted. What has been
done has been done, then, incompletely, though with an extremely
economical expenditure, and it is perhaps a matter of congratulation
that it has been possible to do somuch with so limited an amount.

The appropriation made for the National Zoological Park by the sun-
dry civil bill passed August 5, 1892, was in the following terms:

For continuing the construction of roads, walks, bridges, water
supply, sewerage and drainage, and for grading, planting, and other-
wise improving the grounds, erecting and repairing buildings and
inclosures for the animals, and for administrative purposes, care, sub-
sistence, and transportation of animals, including salaries and compen-
sation of all necessary employés, and general incidental expenses not
otherwise provided for, fifty thousand dollars, one-half of which sum
shall be paid from the revenues of the District of Columbia and the
other half from the Treasury of the United States; and a report in
detail of the expenses of the National Zoological Park shall be made
to Congress at the beginning of each regular session.

The previous year had fully demonstrated that the park successfully
fulfilled one of the purposes for which it was created—that of the
‘instruction and recreation of the people.” After having done all that
lay in my power for the promotion of the primar, y objects of the park*

* A full statement of the number and condition of these animals will be found in
the report of the acting manager. It may be stated here, however, that indigenous
wild animals constitute at present a large majority of the whole.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

it became necessary to further, as far as possible, and in the same con-
nection, the recreation of the public. To this end, and to that of con-
venience and safety, the roadways have been widened and extended,
footways have been placed on the bridge, the access to the principal
animal house and to the principal outdoor cages has been improved,
and all inclosures considered unsafe have been properly strengthened
or defended.

Since the Rock Creek electric railway has been in operation many
passengers by that route enter the park by the western entrance upon
Connecticut avenue extended. More than 2,000 persons have some-
times entered here during a single day. This has made it necessary to
extend the main road through the park to that entrance, which has
been done on the lines indicated by Mr. F. L. Olmsted, and gives a
driveway through the most beautiful part of the park. The funds at
the disposal of the park were insufficient to complete this road in a
permanent manner. As soon as practicable it should be macadamized
and made equal to the suburban roads with which it communicates.

It is necessary to emphasize the fact that the number of visitors to
the park so far exceeds all the earlier calculations that unexpected
outlays have become necessary. A wider sidewalk of a permanent
character is needed from the Quarry road entrance to that at Connec-
ticut avenue. A temporary wooden walk has been placed to the ani-
mal house from the first-named point, but is far too narrow for the
crowds entering there every Sunday and holiday, while no sidewalk
exists from the western entrance of the park.

The bridge near the Quarry road entrance has proved quite insuf-
ficient for the crowds of carriages and foot passengers that throng it
upon every holiday. It was and still is greatly to be regretted that
under the actual appropriations a larger and more tasteful structure
could not have been built at this point; it was erected under the neces-
sity of getting visitors across the river in some way, and is in a form
entirely unsatisfactory to those who, under such necessity, designed it.
Some relief has been given during the year by the addition of narrow
footways on either side of the driveway. ‘These are quite too narrow,
but are all that the present structure will allow compatible with safety.
It may be found necessary to build a footbridge at a point higher up
the stream to somewhat relieve the pressure at this point.

The addition to the principal animal house mentioned in last year’s
report has been completed and fully occupied. It is merely a frame
shed built in as cheap a manner as is consistent with safety, and
warmth, and it appears incongruous when compared with the solid stone
structure of which it forms an annex. The original design of con-
structing this entire building of stone should not be abandoned. It is
already found to be insufficient for the needs of the park, and must at
no distant day be further extended. It will be necessary hereafter to
bear in mind that the cages for animals must be larger and confined
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

usually to but one side of the building. The throngs of visitors are
now sometimes so great that it is impossible for them to view the
animals properly when the cages are small and scattered along both
sides of a passageway.

The lack of any provision for the purchase of animals has worked
serious disadvantage to the collection. Under the most favorable cir-
cumstances the mortality in a collection of animals confined under
unnatural conditions is very great, and constant additions must be
made if its scientific value is to be maintained. The park has for the
last year been forced to depend upon gifts, loans, and collections sent
from the Yellowstone Park. Gifts have been rare and mostly insig-
nificant. The animals collected at the Yellowstone Park by direction
of the honorable the Secretary of the Interior have, while important
and valuable, cost more for transportation alone than similar animals
would have cost if purchased of dealers and safely delivered at their
expense. Various other schemes of collection have been tried, all of
which have proved nore expensive than purchase would have been.
It is hoped that in time, as the National Zoological Park becomes
more widely known, the same advantages of cheap purchase will be
offered to it as are now made use of by dealers; that is, that the ani-
mals brought in by sailors or captured by hunters will be sent to it at
low prices. Even now such offers are frequently made, though they
are necessarily refused, as the appropriation does not allow any pur-
chases.

Experience has shown that there should be provision made for a res-
ident superintendent. At present the entire park and animals are left
at night in charge of watchmen only. If any exigency arises it must
wait for morning to bring relief. The isolation of the buildings hous-
ing the animals, and the distance of the park from town, make it the
more necessary that there should always be at hand, within call, some
person of authority to direct in case direction is needed. For this the
Holt house may be made available. It is ina part of the park reserved
for administrative purposes, and a portion of it now accommodates the
office. With asmall outlay it could be made asuitable dwelling. The
advantages of such an arrangement are too obvious to be recounted,
and the effect upon the employés of the constant presence of the super-
intendent would be very beneficial.

The number of animals at present in the park is 504. Of these 322
are native and 182 foreign. In the appendix to this report tables are
given showing the accessions in detail.

ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

In my report for 1890-91 reference was made to the circumstances
which led to the establishment of the astro-physical observatory, and
in that of last year I gave a brief description of the general object and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

scope of such an establishment, touching upon some of the essential
features of the work which had been undertaken under my direction.

An explicit description of the specially important investigation which
has been continued during the last year, and which is now drawing to
a completion, can not so well be given here as in a later portion of
the report to which the reader is referred, but the general object
of the immediate work is, as has already been stated, the detailed
investigation of that great spectral region, still nearly unknown, where
yet the greater portion of the solar energy is known to be displayed;
or, in other words, of that invisible portion of the solar spectrum which
lies beyond the limit of the red.

That the solar spectrum did not cease at the limit of visibility has
long been known, and the attention of many distinguished physicists
has been directed to the investigation of this invisible part, whose
presence is manifest neither to the eye nor to any ordinary process of
photography, but which nevertheless comprises more than three-fourths
of the energy which the sun sends to us. Were the range of the human
eye vastly extended so as to enable us to receive impressions corre-
sponding in character to the kind of energy which is present in this
infra-red region we should see in it phenomena of precisely the same
character as we now see in the limited spectral region to which we are
physiologically limited. It was probably this idea which led Melloni
to the use of the term “heat color” to convey to the mind some idea
of this similarity between the invisible and the ordinary visible spec-
trum, and this term expresses by the force of association the charac-
teristics distinguishing one portion of this region from another, char-
acteristics which, although unrecognized by the eye or by any of our
senses directly, are yet more striking in their various physical results
than the various colors which mark out to the eye the great divisions
of the visible spectrum.

The invisible spectrum, then, is marked by narrow bands or lines,
which are almost entirely devoid of energy, quite like those which appear
in the visible spectrum as black lines and are known as the “‘ Frauenhofer
lines.” It is to the study of these Frauenhofer lines of the visible spec-
trum, that we owe nearly all those recent advances which have not only
given us definite information as regards the constitution and nature of
the heavenly bodies, but have been of immense advantage in the study
of meteorological and atmospheric phenomena on the earth. The prac-
tical importance of the study of the character of these lines in the invis-
ible spectrum (where their intensity and probably their number is far
greater than in the visible) then is evident.

Here, however, all ordinary methods of spectroscopic investigation
fail; but long since the writer devised a method which has in the course
of the last two years been perfected to such a degree as to enable us
to search out the lines in this invisible spectrum and to map them with
32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

a degree of accuracy only inferior to that which can be attained by the
eye.

The instrument by which this is accomplished is the bolometer, which,
as now constructed, is a minute strip of metal barely ;}> of an inch

of metal a current of electricity is continually kept flowing. When
the spectrum, visible or invisible, is thrown upon it, the thread is
warmed and the current decreased by an amount corresponding to
the intensity of the effect received, while novel instruments specially
mounted and constructed, are in electric connection with the thread and
now automatically record every minute change in this current.

With late improvements these instruments are so delicate that a
change of temperature of one millionth of a degree is readily detected
nd even measured, and it is easy to see that as a consequence of this
delicacy the greatest care must be taken in their use. Thus the labora-
tory must be almost completely darkened, and closed tightly, so as to
exclude all drafts and to keep it at as nearly a uniform temperature
as possible, while for other reasons it must be kept under constant
hygrometric conditions.

The passage of wagons or carriages in the neighboring streets even
is liable to cause serious trouble. Hence, the necessity for as complete
isolation of the laboratory as possible, and the rigorous exclusion at
all times of all whose presence is not indispensable.

In addition to these difficulties there are others of specially trying
character due to the nature of the work.

To maintain other necessary conditions, the opening of a door or
window for purposes of ventilation is forbidden, even in summer,
although the temperature sometimes rises to 100° and even 110°, ren-
dering the work of observing in the small, non-ventilated and darkened
room very trying to the health of the observer. Frequent changes in
the staff of the Observatory have been necessary for this and other
reasons, and the progress of the work has been delayed in consequence.
In spite of these and other difficulties, most of which are due to the
very temporary and inefficient nature of the small wooden building
in which the work is carried on, and its proximity to the traffic-laden
streets, the expectations of last year have been largely realized, and
a detailed publication of the work accompanied by charts showing
several hundred new and before unknown lines, will shortly be issued.

Important as these results are, they are but the beginning of what
it may be hoped will be accomplished, with proper facilities.

In view of what has been already accomplished, I hope that Con-
gress will see fit to make provision for the needs of the Astro-phys-
ical Observatory in the provision of a suitable site, the money for
a small permanent building being already available through the pro-
visions made by friends of the Institution whose contributions for this
purpose have already been acknowledged.

NECROLOGY.

RANDALL LEE GIBSON.

Randall Lee Gibson was born at Spring Hill near Versailles, Ky.,
September 10, 1832; was educated in Lexington, Ky.; in Terre Bonne
Parish, La.; at Yale College, and in the law department of the Tulane
University of Louisiana. During the civil war he commanded a com-
pany, regiment, brigade, and division in the Confederate army. He was
arepresentative in the Forty-fourth, Forty-fifth, Forty-sixth, and Forty-
seventh Congress, and was clected to the Senate in 1883, and his see-
ond term as Senator would have expired on March 3, 1895.

Senator Gibson was appointed a Regent of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion December 19, 1887, and was reappointed March 28, 1889, filling the
office till his death, on December 15, 1892. His services as a Regent
were warmly recognized in the nemorial and resolutions presented at
the meeting of the Board on January 25, 1895.

Senator Gibson brought to the performance of his duties as Regent a
rare preparation as student, scholar, and statesman. With inherited
talents for oratory, and with strong literary tendencies, he was sur-
rounded in youth by all the influences that direct the energies of a man
to the public welfare. At Yale College he took a very prominent stand
in a group noted for talent and enthusiasm. Foreign travel, the study
of law, the life of a planter, a distinguished military career, and long
service in the Congress of the United States, filled his capacious mind
with a store of a rich and varied experience, and trained him for the
highest duties. Life was to him a consecration to public duty, and the
performance of that duty his highest felicity. Benevolent, brave,
patient, prudeat, faithful, his grace and gentleness were the rich
drapery of an inflexible will and tenacious purpose.

He came to the Smithsonian Institution as a servant animated by the
fullest sense of his responsibilities and self-pledged to a rigid perform-
ance of them. His interest in the Institution has been limited only by
the conditions of his position. His death, which occurred at Hot
Springs, Ark., on December 15, 1892, is a loss to his State and his
country, in whose councils he has served for eighteen years.

THOMAS GEORGE HODGKINS.

Thomas George Hodgkins was born in England in 1803, and his
early boyhood was spent there. When about 17 years of age, led by
a youth’s love of adventure, as well as by the desire to aid his family,
then in somewhat reduced circumstances, he shipped on one of the
East India Company’s vessels, and made a voyage to the farther east,
where he narrowly escaped death by shipwreck. Consequent upon
this misadventure, came confinement in a hospital in Calcutta for some
months. During this period of enforced quiet and physical inaction,
he formed the resolve that his life, if spared, should henceforth be
devoted to advancing the welfare of his fellow men.

SM 93——d
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

After recovery he returned to England, where he married. <A few
years later he came to the United States, and in 1830 established hin-
self as a manufacturer in New York City. Such success attended his
business ventures that in 1859 he withdrew from active pursuits and
returned to Europe, where he traveled for some years. His heart,
however, led him again to this country, which he had chosen as the
home of his early manhood, and which he now made the abiding place
of his mature years. In 1873 he bought a country place near the vil-
lage of Setauket, on Long Island, which he named ‘“Brambletye
Farm,” and which Lecame his home for the remainder of his life.

Those who had the privilege of a personal acquaintance with Mr.
Hodgkins saw in him not only a man of unusual judgment in business
affairs, of broad and far-reaching philanthropy, and of deep sincerity
in his purpose to benefit his fellow-creatures, but they were struck by
the breadth of his views as expressed in connection with subjects gen-
erally held to pertain more exclusively to purely scientific research,
every domain of which he gladly sought to make contributory to his
earnest desire to benefit mankind.

His life was simple and his wants but few, and requiring only a small
portion of the products of the home farm for his own use, he pursued
his long-established habit of systematic benevolence by giving the
remainder to those around him.

Fulfilling also the purpose, formed long years before, to further the
good of mankind by all means at his command, he devoted the greater
part of his large fortune to various benevolert objects, reserving but a
comparatively small sum for his own support.

His sympathy for the helpless and weak led him to contribute largely
to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, and
to the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.. He
gave $100,000 to the Royal Institution of Great Britain and $200,000 to
the Smithsonian Institution, stipulating that while the latter sum
should be included with the original Smithson Foundation, that the
income from one-half of it should be devoted to researches and inves-
tigations on atmospheric air in connection with the welfare of man.

The death of Mr. Hodgkins occurred at his home in Setauket on the
25th of November, 1892. Those whose duty it is to carry out the plans
and to administer the trust laid upon them by the bequest of this man,
who so simply and earnestly determined to make the world better by his
life, are glad to know that he had the satisfaction of living to see, and
to approve the initiatory steps taken in administering the Hodgkins
fund of the Smithsonian Institution. A biography of him, in some
respects fuller and more personal, will be found in the minutes of the
Board of Regents for the present year.

Respectfully submitted,
S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX. TO SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.
THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The detailed report of the Assistant Secretary in charge, upon the operations of
the Museum for the year will be published as Part 11 of the Report of the Smith-
sonian Institution. I shall here speak of only the more important matters.

Additions to the collections.—The additions to all departments of the Museum dur-
ing the year number 82,148 specimens. These were for the most part miscellaneous
in character, and, while valuable in themselves, did not tend to so large an extent
to supply gaps in the various series as would be the case were larger funds ayail-
able for purchases. Important collections made by the U. 8. Geological Survey, U.
S. Fish Commission, and several other bureaus of the Government, in connection
with their regular work, have been transmitted to the Museum. With the care of
such collections the Museum is charged by act of Congress.

A table showing the number of specimens now in each department of the Museum
and for each year since 1882 accompanies the report of the Assistant Secret ary,
which has been already referred to.

The scientific staff—The number of scientific departments in the Museum remains
the same as last year, and few changes in the personnel have been made. Mr. Fred-
erick W. True, curator of .mammals, has been designated ‘‘Curator-in-charge” and
acts as the executive officer of the Museum, in the absence of the Assistant Secretary.

The proportion of honorary curators remains the same as last year. About five-
sevenths of the departments are presided over by unpaid officers who are officially
attached to other departments and bureaus of the Government, especially the U.S.
Geological Survey and the U.S. Fish Commission. This arrangement is in the interest
of economy, butit is not conducive to the general welfare of the Museum that the
proportion should be so large as at present, since the necessity of devoting most of
their time to other matters makes it impossible for the honorary curators to advance
the work of their departments as they could if they were attached to the Museum
alone.

Distribution of specimens.—It has for many years been customary to distribute to
educational establishments, as far as practicable, the duplicate material separated
from the Museum collections. This has been possible hitherto, as a part of the
systematic operations of the Museum, only in the case of fishes, marine invertebrates-
rocks, minerals, and casts of prehistoric implements, aithough special collections
have occasionally been prepared to meet special needs. A large number of sets of
rocks and minerals have been sent cut during the year. During the two decades
from 1871 to 1890 about 278,000 specimens in all were distributed. ‘The duplicates in
other departments of the Museum are being arranged in sets for distribution as fast
as the facilities at the disposal of the curators permit.

During the year ending June 30, 1893, the number of specimens sent out in
exchange or distributed to educational institutions was 15,581.

Visitors.—The total number of visitors to the Smithsonian building during the year
was 174,188, and tothe Museum building 319,930, giving a total of 494,188 persons who

Bi)
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

visited the two buildings. This total shows an increase of 109,476 over the previous
year.

Publications.—The Report of the National Museum for 1890 (Part 1 of the Smith,
sonian Report) has been published, and that for 1891 will shortly be issued. The
report for 1892 is in the hands of the Publie Printer.

Volume xty of the Proceedings of the Museum has been issued in bound form, and
all the separate papers composing Volume Xv have been received «nd distributed.
The manuscript of a number of papers belonging to Volume Xvi has also been
sent to the Public Printer, and several of these were issued in pamphlet form before
the close of the fiscal year.

Part F, of Bulletin No. 39, ‘ Directions for collecting and preserving insects,” by
C. V. Riley, and Part G, of the same Bulletin, ‘‘ Instructions for collecting mollusks
andother useful hints for the conchologist,” by William H. Dall, and also Bulletin 40,
“The Published Writings of George Newbold Lawrence, 1844-1891,” by L.S. Foster,
have been published. Bulletin 41, ‘‘The Published Writings of Dr. Charles Girard,”
by G. Brown Goode, and Bulletin 42, ‘‘A preliminary descriptive catalogue of the
systematic collections in economic geology and metallurgy in the U.S. National
Museum,” by Frederic P. Dewey, were issued during the preceding year.

The manuscript for Bulletin 43, ‘‘A Monograph of the Bats of North America,” by
Harrison Allen, M.p., Bulletin 44, ‘‘Catalogue of the Lepidopterous Superfamily
Noctuidz found in Boreal America,” by John B. Smith, Bulletin 45, ‘‘The Myriapoda
of North America,” by Charles Harvey Bollman, and Bulletin 46, ‘‘ Monograph of the
North American Proctotrypide,” by William H. Ashmead, has been sent to the Public
Printer, the illustrations have been engraved, and the text put in type. Special
Bulletin No. 1, ‘‘ Life Histories of North American Birds,” by Capt. Charles E.
Bendire, honorary curator of birds’ eggs in the Museum, has been issued. This is
the first quarto volume published by the Museum. Special Bulletin No. 2, ‘‘ Oceanic
Ichthyology,” a monograph of the deep sea and pelagic fishes of the world, by G.
Brown Goode and Tarleton H. Bean, is in the hands of the Public Printer, and it
is expected that the volume will be ready for distribution early in the next year.

The demand for the Museum publications has increased to such an extent that
many worthy applications are daily refused. An increase in the allotment for
printing can not be too strongly urged, in order that the Museum may be enabled to
place a full series of its publications in representative libraries in different parts of
each State. If a wider distribution of publications of the Museum were provided
for, the Museum would undoubtedly receive in exchange the valuable publications
of many scientific institutions which are at present only meagerly represented in
its library.

The Worlds Columbian Exposition.—On April 25, 1890, an act ‘‘to provide for
celebrating the four hundredth anniversary of the discovery of America by Christopher
Columbus by holding an international exhibition of arts, industries, manufactures,
and the product of the soil, mine, and sea in the city of Chicago, in the State of
Illinois,” was approved by the President of the United States. This act authorized
the participation of the Executive Departments, the Smithsonian Institution and
National Museum, and the U. S. Fish Commission in the Exposition. A Gov-
ernment Board of Control was organized, consisting of representatives of each
of these Departments. ‘They were appointed by the President of the United States,
and under their control was placed the preparation, installation, and administration
of the Government exhibit. Upon my recommendation, Dr. G. Brown Goode,
Assistant Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution in charge of the National
Museum, was appointed Representative of the Smithsonian Institution and National
Museum.

As soon as the character and scope of the exhibit had been decided upon, agents
were at once instructed to proceed to various localities, with a view to collecting
material necessary for illustrating the condition of the continent at the time of its
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. on

discovery by Columbus, and for representing the animal life and the natural
resources of the country. The work of mounting and arranging the specimens was
immediately begun, and continued until the beginning of the present calendar year.

In February, the first shipments to Chicago were made. The entire exhibit filled
twenty-nine cars. On the opening day, May 1, the exhibits were all in place and
were formally opened to the public.

In the act authorizing the Exposition special provision was made for the con-
struction of a separate building for the exhibits of the United States Government, at
a cost of $400,000. About 22,000 square feet of floor space were assigned to the Smith-
sonian Institution and National Museum at the south center of the building.

Before closing these statementsI feel it my duty again to allude to the over-
crowded condition of the halls of the present Museum building. This has been
temporarily alleviated to some extent by the transmission of a large number of
specimens from several departments of the Museum to the World’s Columbian
Exposition, but at the close of the Exposition these objects will be returned. Some
provision must also be made for the objects which were acquired especially for the

Ixposition, as well as for material which will doubtless be presented to the United
States by foreign governments and private exhibitors.

I have already called attention to the large number of specimens, now in the
storerooms, which have never yet been provided for, and which are in danger of
deteriorating, owing to the impossibility of properly caring for them. Iam aware
that the burden of these remarks has become au annual repetition, but I feel it my
duty to continue to make these representations until Congress, upon whom the
responsibility falls, shall erect an additional Museum building, or at least fire-proof
storage-sheds.

Imust again call attention to the need of larger appropriations for the current
work. The number of visitors and the demands of the publie are constantly
increasing, and more money is necessary in order to carry on legitimate work ina bus-
iness-like and effective manner. The clerical employés are paid less than in the
Executive Departments, and many of them leave after a short period of service, to
the serious detriment of the Museum, which is compelled to train new clerks.

In the matter of heating and lighting, to which I called special attention in my
last report, I trust that the full amount asked for, including the cost of new heating
apparatus, which I have estimated at $4,000, will be allowed by Congress. I may
add that much sickness has occurred during previous winters owing to the impossi-
bility of keeping all the offices in the building properly heated with the small
amount of coal which could be purchased.
APPENDIX IT.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF ETHNOLOGY FOR THE
YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1893.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report on the work of the Bureau
under my charge during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893. In recent years the
researches of the Bureau have been largely topical and carried forward along lines
representing the chief natural divisions of ethnologic science. The report is arranged
bv these subjects of investigation.

PICTOGRAPHY AND SIGN LANGUAGE.

Researches concerning the pictography and sign language of the native American
tribes were continued by Col. Garrick Mallery, who spent a part of the year in
the field in northern New England and contiguous territory in special work among
the survivors of the Abnaki, Micmac, and other Algonquian tribes. The work
resulted in substantial additions to knowledge of the picture writing and gesture
speech among these people. During the greater part of the year Col. Mallery was
oceupied in the office first inpreparing and afterward in revising and correcting
the proof sheets of his extended report entitled “ Picture writing of the Ameri-
ean Indians,” which forms the greater part of the tenth annual report of the
Bureau. This elaborate treatise is a practically exhaustive monograph on the sub-
ject to which it relates, The plates and text illustrations, which together comprise
nearly fourteen hundred figures, were collected with care and represent the aborigi-
nal picture writing of all portions of the country with fidelity, while the signifi-
cance and relations of the glyphs are discussed in detail in the text.

During the later portion of the year, in intervals of the work of proof revising,
Col. Mallery continued the collection and arrangement of material relating to 116
sign language of the American aborigines. A preliminary treatise on this subject
was published in one of the early reports of the Bureau; but since that time, partly
through thestimulus to study of the habits and customs of our native tribes afforded
by that publication, a large amount of additionul material has been obtained. It is
the purpose to collate and discuss this material in a final monograph, which will be,
it is believed, even more comprehensive than that on pictography, and Col. Mallery
has made satisfactory progress in this work.

Dr. W. J. Hoffman, who has for some years been associated with the work on pic-
tography and sign language, was occupied during the greater part of the year in
collateral researches relating to the ceremonies of a secret society (the ‘‘Grand
Medicine Society”) of the Menomoni Indians of Wisconsin. Beginning with the
study of the pictographs and gestures of these Indians he gradually extended his
investigations to other characteristics of the tribe, and for three years in succession
attended the initiation of candidates into their most important secret society, and
was thus enabled to obtain the archaic linguistic forms used only in the language
employed in the esoteric ritual. The data collected were subsequently collated with
a view to publication. Some attention was also given to linguistic matter, includ- ~
ing gesture speech, collected among the Absaroka Indians in Montana and the Leech
lake band of Ojibwa Indians in Minnesota.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. B34)

ARCHEOLOGY.

Archeologic researches were actively continued by Prof. W. H. Holmes, with sev-
eral collaborators and assistants, in different eastern States and in the interior. The
work in eastern United States has been notably rich in results of sciemtific value.
Prof. Holmes examined in detail the novaculite quarries of Arkansas, the pipestone
quarries of Minnesota, and the ancient copper mines of Isle Royale, Mich. He also
made important studies at various points in the valleys of Potomac, Genesee, and
Ohio rivers, and his surveys and examinations in the Delaware valley, particularly
about Trenton, were especially extended. At the last-named locality advantage
was taken of the excavation of a broad and deep trench parallel with the river front
at Trenton to study carefully the late glacial gravels commonly supposed to yield
human relics. Tor a period of six weeks the excellent exposures made in this trench,
25 to 35 feet deep, were constantly watched by Prof. Holmes and Mr. William Din-
widdie, without, however, the finding of a single artificial object in the previously
undisturbed gravels. This negative result is believed to be of great importance to
American archeology. Special examinations, frequently requiring excavations, were
made of the ancient soapstone quarries of the District of Columbia and in Virginia,
Mr. Dinwiddie and Mr. Gerard Fowke aiding in the work; and toward the close of
the year Mr. De Lancey W. Gill, of the U.S. Geological Survey, was detailed to make
an examination of the ancient mica mines of North Carolina. Valuable collections
of material representing aboriginal arts and industries grew out of this work.

In December Prof. Holmes was placed in charge of the exhibit of the Bureau of
Ethnology for the World’s Columbian Exposition at Chicago, and several months
were occupied mainly in preparing, classifying, labeling, and arranging the exhibit,
which includes (1) a series of collections illustrating aboriginal quarrying, mining,
and implement-making industries; (2) various collections of ethnologic material
made chiefly by collaborators of the Bureau; and (3) a series of life-size figures
illustrating the domestic life, arts, and industries of the aborigines. It isa pleasure
to observe that this exhibit attracted great attention among visitors to the Fair.
Messrs. H. W. Henshaw, James Mooney, F. H. Cushing, and Gerard Fowke aided
in the preparation of this exhibit.

At intervals throughout the year Prof. Holmes continued researches concerning
the development of the shaping arts. Hitherto, American archeologists have in
general been content to accept the classification of prehistoric peoples into culture
stages based on the products of art work in stone, the classification being derived
from European studies. During the last decade different archeologists have devoted
much attention to the development of pristine culture as indicated by the artificial
stone implements, weapons, and other objects found in many parts of this country,
and have come to question the applicability of the European classification. While
the investigation can not be regarded as complete, it is worthy of note that a large
body of data has been brought together which seem to afford a basis for an indige-
nous Classification of primitive American art products. This classification will, it
is believed, eventually give character to that branch of American archeology which
deals with art in stone.

Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff continued his study of the Pueblo relics and prepared an
elaborate treatise on the subject for the press. This work, under the title ‘‘Aborig-
inal Remains in the Valley of the Rio Verde,” is now completed and forms part of
the thirteenth annual report. It illustrates in detail the architecture and various
industrial arts recorded in the ruined cities of pre-Columbian tribes in the
Southwest. :

In addition to the surveys and researches already noted, Mr. Gerard Fowke was
employed for several months in archeologic explorations in Ohio. He was able to
obtain much valuable material.
40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

INDIAN MOUNDS.

The researches concerning the ancient Indian mounds distributed over many por-
tions of the country, particularly the Mississippi Valley, have been continued by
Dr. Cyrus ‘Thomas. The chief work during the year has been the preparation of
matter for publication and the revision of proofs of text and illustrations. The
principal results of Dr. Thomas’s researches are incorporated in amonograph of over
700 pages in the eleventh annual report. Several minor papers relating to differ-
ent classes of articles collected from mounds also are in various stages of prepara-
tion, two being ready for publication.

In addition to his special work on the Indian mounds, Dr. Thomas was able to
devote some time to the study of certain Mexican codices of exceptional archeo-
logic interest. Considerable progress has been made in analyzing the characters of
the Maya codices, and it is believed that these highly significant inscriptions may
ultimately be deciphered by means of the methods devised and pursued by him.

No field work was conducted in this branch of the Bureau during the year.

SOCIOLOGY.

The work on sociology of the American Indians was continued by Mr. H. W. Hen-
shaw. The earlier part of the year was spent in collecting sociologic and linguistic
materials among the Indians of Butte, Mendocino, and San Diego counties, Califor-
nia. Early in 1893 Mr. Henshaw was unfortunately compelled by ill health to ask
for indefinite leave of absence.

Mr. James Mooney spent the greater part of the year in the field collecting infor-
mation concerning the Sioux ghost dance, and concerning the habits, customs, and
social relations of the Kiowa and other tribes, visiting the Sioux Indians at Pine
Ridge, 8. Dak., the Shoshoni and northern Arapaho in Wyoming, and the
Cheyenne, southern Arapahos, Kiowa, Comanche, and associated tribes in Okla-
homa. In addition to valuable literary material, he made important collections of
objects representing aboriginal life, including a series of Kiowa shield models with
illustrative pictography affording data for a study of primitive heraldry, and three
important calendars.

In December Mr. Mooney was commissioned to make collections among the Nava-
jos and Moquis of New Mexico and Arizona for exhibition at the World’s Fair. This
work resulted in a remarkable collection of unique material from two of our most
interesting native tribes, including the products of industrial arts, costumery, etce.,
as well as the photographs and materials needed for preparing and exhibiting a
series of groups of life-sized figures illustrating domestic life, industries, and cere-
monies. In addition an unprecedentedly extensive collection of Indian food products
was obtained for the National Museum.

LINGUISTICS.

Linguistic researches were continued by Rev. J. Owen Dorsey, Dr. Albert 8.
Gatschet, and Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt. Mr. Dorsey continued his investigations in con-
nection with the report on Indian synonymy, making a thorough study of the
Catawba tribes and their habitats. He also resumed work on the Biloxi language,
at first using the material collected during the previous year, arranging the Biloxi
verbs in fourteen conjugations, making a list of Biloxi onomatopes, and compiling a
Biloxi-Euglish vocabulary of about two thousand entries together with a catalogue
of Biloxi roots. For the purpose of carrying this investigation to completion he
visited Lecompte, La., during the winter and spent two months with the survivors
of this interesting tribe. In addition he practically finished the work of editing
the manuscript of Riggs, ‘‘ Dakota Grammar, Texts and Ethnography,” which con-
stitutes Volume 1x of the series of Contributions to North American Ethnology.
Proofs of this work, which is about to leave the press, were revised during the latter
portion of the year.

The earlier part of the year was spent by Dr. Gatschet in the study of the Wichita
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Al

language at the Educational Home for Indian boysin Philadelphia. Special atten-
tion was given to the Wichita verb, which, like the verb of all the Caddoan lan-
guages, is highly complex in its inflections and in the permutability of its conso-
nants. From October 1 up to the end of April Mr. Gatschet was occupied in the
study of the Peoria, Shawnee (or Shawano), Arapaho, and Cheyenne languages in
Indian Territory. Eight weeks were devoted to the Peoria language, during which
period over three thousand terms and a corresponding number of phrases and sen-
tences were collected and revised. This study is deemed of exceptional interest,
since no texts of the Peoria language are known to have appeared in print.

The Shawnee was the language next taken up. Assisted in the field by good
interpreters, Dr. Gatschet obtained copies and reliable material in texts of the
phraseology and terms of the Shawnee language, a number of verbal and nominal
paradigms, and a choice selection of instances showing the multiplicity of duplication.

Subsequently he took up the Arapaho and Cheyenne languages. Both are nasal-
izing and are spoken in several dialects differing but little from each other. Ample
collections were made of lexical and phraseological material, with texts and some
poetic specimens. The ethnographic study of these genuine prairie Indians is highly
interesting, since they have had but a few years of intercourse with the white man
and his civilizing, as well as corrupting, influences.

Mr. Hewitt continued his work on the Iroquoian languages, with which he is
thoroughly familiar. He was able to ascertain and formulate the principles or canons
governing the number, kind, and position of notional stems in symphrases, or word-
sentences, Six rules are formulated which establish and govern the morphologic
ground plan of words and word-sentences. These are as follows:

First. The simple or the compound stem of a notional word of a word-sentence
may not be emptoyed as an element of discourse without a prefixed simple or com-
plex personal pronoun, or sign or flexion denotive of gender, the prefixion of the
latter taking place with nouns only.

Second. Only two notional stems may be combined in the same word-sentence,
and they must belong respectively to different parts of speech.

Third. An adjective-stem may not combine with a verb-stem, but it may unite
with the formative tha’, to make or cause, or with the inchoative ¢.

Fourth. The stem of a verb or adjective may combine with the stem of a noun,
and such stem of a verb or adjective must be placed after and never before the noun-
stem.

Fifth. A qualificative or other word or element must not be interposed between
the two combined stems of compound notional words, nor between the simple or
compound notional stem and its simple or complex pronominal prefix.

Sixth. Derivative and formative change may be effected only by the prefixion or
suffixion of suitable flexions to the morphologies fixed by the foregoing rules or
canons.

Mr. Hewitt also continued his general study of the Iroquoian languages de-
scribed in previous reports, and collected additional material relating to the man-
ners, customs, and history of the Iroquis Indians, chiefly by translation and abstrac-
tion from the Jesuit relations and accounts of the early French explorers. He also
continued work on the Tuskarora-English dictionary and grammar.

MYTHOLOGY.

The researches in mythology, by Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing and Mrs. Matilda
Coxe Stevenson, were continued throughout the year. Mr. Cushing was occupied
chiefly in arranging and collating material previously collected, with a view to pub-
lication. An important result of his work is the demonstration of the fact that the
mythic concepts, which form so large a part of the intellectual life of primitive
peoples are greatly modified by the bodily organs and functions exercised in their
expression. In some cases this relation between organ or function on the one hand
and concept on the other is so intimate as to justify the ascription of the modern con-
42 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

cept to dual causes, of which the first is intellectual, while the hardly less essential
second cause is physiologic; e. g., it may be shown conclusively that the decimal sys-
tem forming the basis of the arithmetic of certain southwestern tribes is essentially
indigenous and has grown up through successive generations from counting on the
fingers in certain definite ways. This relation between concepts and physiologic
structure is especially significant in its bearing on the development of primitive
mythology.

Mrs. Stevenson was occupied during a part of the vear in revising for the press
her report entitled ‘‘The Sia,” which forms the leading paper of the twelfth annual
report of the Bureau, now in the hands of the printer. She was also engaged for
several months in the preparation of a memoir on the secret societies and ceremo-
nials of the Zuni Indians. Mrs. Stevenson’s researches on these southwestern tribes
have not only resulted in important contributions to knowledge of the primitive
beliefs by which the daily life of these peoples was governed, but have also thrown
light on the migrations and ethnic relations of their ancestors. The monograph on
this subject, which is illustrated by numerous graphic representations, is approach-
ing completion.

BIBLIOGRAPHY.

The work on bibliography of native American languages was continued by Mr.
James C. Pilling. Two numbers of the series of bibliographies were issued as
bulletins of the Bureau during the year, another was sent to press, and a fourth was
nearly completed in manuscript. The later proofs of the sixth of the series, which
relates to the Athapascan languages, were revised early in the year. The work
was subsequently issued as a bulletin of 138 pages, embracing 544 titular entries
with 4 facsimile reproductions. Although the publication was not distributed
until spring of the present calendar year, it has already been favorably noticed in
scientific journals in this and other countries; and the critical reviews show that
the students of our native languages place this work by Mr. Pilling on the same
high plane accorded the previous volumes of the series.

The bibliography of the Chinookan languages (including the Chinook jargon)
was sent to press in October and proof revision was finished in April. In the com-
pilation of this bibliography much attention was given to the origin and growth of
the Chinook jargon, or “trade language,” of the northwestern coast, which has
come to be an international dialect, affording the established means of communica-
tion between the whites and the several native tribes occupying the region between
the State of Washington and Alaska, whose languages are many and diverse.
While this bibliography (the seventh of the series) comprises but 94 pages and
includes only 270 titular entries, it is believed that it will prove no less valuable to
linguistic students than the earlier numbers, since it is substantially a record of a
dead language, there being but one man now living who fully understands the
tongue on which the linguistic relations of the family rest. The edition of this bul-
letin was delivered by the Public Printer in May.

The manuscript of the bibliography of the Salishan languages was sent to press
in March, and proof revision is in progress. This work exceeds in volume the
Chinookan bibliography, and, like that, deals with the records of one of the highly
interesting group of native tongues of our Pacific region, which, though doomed
to early extinction, are among the most important sources of information concerning
the development of language.

Toward the close of the year Mr. Pilling was occupied in preparing for the press
the bibliography of the Wakashan languages, the ninth number of the series, which
is now well advanced.

The value of the several bibliographies has been greatly enhanced, and their prep-
aration has been materially facilitated through the cooperation of linguistic
students in different parts of the country. Special acknowledgments are due Mr.
Horatio Hale, the well-known philologist, and Mr. J. K. Gill, author of a dictionary

of the Chinook jargon, for aid in the preparation of Chinookan bibliography; and
Mr. Pilling acknowledges equal obligations to the Rey. Myron Eells and Dr. Franz
Boas for information concerning the Chinookan and Salishan languages.

SYNONYMY OF INDIAN TRIBES.

The preparation of this work, which has engaged the attention of nearly all the
collaborators of the Bureau at various times, is well advanced. During the year
Messrs H. W. Henshaw, F. Webb Hodge, James Mooney, and J. Owen Dorsey have
contributed to the work. The portions of the synonymy relating to the tribes of
the following stocks are ready for publication:

Attacapan, Beothukan, Kalapooian, Karankawan, Kusan, Lutuamian, Muskho-
gean, Natchesan, Skittagetan, Timuquanan, Tonikan, Uchean, Yakonan, and Yuman.

In addition, the Algonquian and Iroquoian families—two of the largest and most
important—require comparatively little elaboration by Mr. Mooney (to whom these
stocks were originally assigned) to make them ready for press.

When his other duties permitted Mr. Hodge devoted attention to the elaboration
of material pertaining to the Piman family, as well as that of the Pueblo stocks
(Zunian, Keresan, Tafoan, and the Tusayan division of the Shoshonean). Very
little work is now required to finally complete for publication the material
relating to these tribes. In addition, Mr. Hodge introduced into the descriptions
formerly made of some twenty stocks (principally in California) a large body of
new material made known by recent investigators.

PSYCHOLOGY.

Within recent years it has come to be recognized by many ethnologists that the
mythic concepts, and through these the social institutions, of primitive peoples are
dependent on a limited number of factors, including (1) individual and tribal envi-
ronment and (2) individual and collective modes and habits of thought. Now the
first of these factors has received the attention of nearly allinvestigators, while the
second has received much less consideration and is frequently ignored. Accordingly,
it has been thought desirable to undertake the investigation of intellectual method
for the purpose of developing the principles of psychology, and thus affording a more
definite basis for the researches in mythology and sociology. To this subject the
Director has devoted a considerable part of the year, and a tentative system of psy-
chology which will, it is believed, prove a useful guide for further researches has
been formulated.

EXPLORATION.

The Director spent several weeks in ethnologic exploration in the Northern Pacific
slope. The territory lying between the Sierra Nevada Mountains and the Pacific is
of exceptional value to ethnologists by reason of the remarkable number of independ-
ent linguistic stocks crowded into a relatively small area; three-fourths of the dis-
tinct groups of peoples in this country, and fully half of all known on the Western
Hemisphere, are found in this locality. The northern part of the tract has never
been explored by students; and in the hope of discovering additional stocks among
the remaining tribes, and in tue hope of gaining additional knowledge concerning the
origin of this remarkable diversity of languages, an exploratory trip was planned.
The results of the observations are incorporated in reports now in course of prepara-
tion for the press. Mr. Henshaw, in southern California, and Mr. Mooney, in the
northern Rocky Mountain region, also penetrated areas and encountered Indians not
previously seen by scientific students.

MISCELLANEOUS WORK.

As incidentally noted in preceeding paragraphs, much time and thought have
been given to the installation of an ethnologic exhibit in the World’s Columbian
Exposition at Chicago. This exhibit occupies the southern portion of the Govern-
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ment building. It comprises a large amount of material of popular as well as sci-
entific interest, derived from various portions of the country, a considerable part
of this material having been collected or prepared especially for the Exposition.
Most of the collaborators of the Bureau have contributed directly or indirectly to
this exhibit.

The work of the modeling department has been continued. The chief work has
lain in the restoration and repair of models previously constructed and exhibited at
the expositions in New Orleans and Madrid. A number of new models and several
replicas of models already constructed have, however, been executed, chiefly for
use in the Columbian Exposition.

During the year an exceptional number of applications for definite information
concerning our native tribes have been received from the publishers of encyclopedias,
dictionaries, physical geographies, and other standard works, and in view of the
educational value of these publications and. the manifest public advantage to be
gained from the diffusion of the results of the latest scientific researches, it has been
deemed important to respond to such applications as fully as possible. Much infor-
mation has been disseminated in this way during the year, and several encyclopedia
articles have been prepared by the director and different collaborators of the Bureau.

ILLUSTRATIONS.

The work connected with the illustration of reports has been continued under the
supervision of Mr. DeLancey W. Gill, chief of the division of illustrations of the
Geological Survey, the actual labor of executing drawings being performed in large
part by Miss Mary Irvin Wright and Miss Mary M. Mitchell. Most of the work
done by the former artist is highly elaborate, comprising drawings of pueblo life
and ceremonials and representations of scenes in the ceremonials of the Sioux
ghost dance. The chief work of the latter has been the preparation of drawings of
Indian implements, principally objects of stone. Two hundred and fifty-seven orig-
inal drawings designed for reproduction by various processes were executed during
the year.

One thousand three hundred and forty-four engraved proofs have been received
from the Publie Printer during the fiscal year and have been examined, revised or
approved, and returned. The printed editions of all chromolithographs used in the
publications of the Bureau have also been examined and the imperfect sheets
rejected.

The photographie work of the Bureau has been ably directed, as in previous years,
by Mr. J. K. Hillers. The following statement includes the work done in the pho-
tographic laboratory during the year:

46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.
EXPENSES.

The expense of the Exchange Bureau are met in part by direct appropriation
by Congress and in part by appropriations made to Government Departments or
Bureaus, either in their contingent funds or in specific terms for repayment to the
Smithsonian Institution of a portion of the cost of transportation. In 1878 the Board
of Regents established a charge of 5 cents per pound weight for the publications
sent out or received by the various Government bureaus, this charge being neces-
sary to prevent an undue tax upon the resources of the Institution, as the appro-
priations made by Congress have never been sufficient to meet the entire cost of the
service. For similar reasons it has been found necessary to make a charge of the
same amount to {state institutions, and from these a further small sum has been
received,

The appropriation made by Congress for the fiseal year 1892-93 was in the fol-
lowing terms: ‘‘I’or expenses of the system of international exchanges between the
United States and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, including salaries or compensation of all necessary employés, twelve thou-
sand dollars,” which amount was supplemented by a deficiency appropriation of
$5,000.

The receipts and disbursements by the accounting officer of the Smithsonian
Institution on account of international exchanges, under date of July 1, 1893, coy-
ering the fiscal year immediately preceding, were as follows:

The foregoing table shows that the entire amount received from Government
bureaus and other sources was $1,483.99, making the sum practically available for
the specific purpose of exchanges $18,483.99, while the expenses have amounted to
$18,518.25, the deficiency of $34.26 being made up from the Smithsonian fund.

For the year 1892~93 an estimate for the entire expense of the service of $23,000
was submitted, this sum being intended to include in a single appropriation various
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. AT

small items in different appropriation bills, and also an item of $2,000 to cover the
expense of an immediate exchange of parliamentary documents with the countries
entering into the treaty of Brussels in 1886. To this latter treaty for the immediate
exchange of the Congressional Record no effect has yet been given by reason of
lack of funds. The amount originally appropriated for the service of the year
1892~93 was $12,000, as stated above, and this was subsequently increased by a
deficiency appropriatiou of $5,000 upon urgent representation of the need of this
further amount to carry the work through the year,

CORRESPONDENTS.

The new list of correspondents begun upon small ledger cards, January 1, 1892,
has proved of great convenience, and it is only by introducing labor-saving devices
in the arrangements for handling the records that it has been at all possible to meet
the growth of the service with the smaller clerical force.

The number of new ledger cards on July 1, 1892, was 9,808, and on June 30, 1893,
16,340, classified as follows:

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS,

Under the treaty of Brussels of 1886, the text of which was given in full in the
report of the curator of exchanges for 1887-’88, the exchange of the official publi-
cations of theUnited States Government with other countries has been continued by
the Institution, and it now forms a very large proportion of the bureau’s work.

The entire number of publications sent abroad during the year under the provision
of the act of Congress of March 2, 1867, and of the treaty above referred to was
31,850, and there have been received in return 5,196 packages. The United States
Government Departments have forwarded to their correspondents abroad 16,074
packages, and have received in return 12,922 packages. The total number of
exchanges for Government libraries has therefore been 18,118 packages received and
47,924 packages sent abroad, a total of 66,042 packages, or about 65 per cent of the
entire number handled. :

The very inadequate return for the great number of documents sent out is in part
undoubtedly due to the fact that no other country publishes on such a lavish scale
asourown. Direct solicitation made by a special representative to the governments
with which we are in correspondence would also probably result in a considerable
increase to the Library of Congress.

The exchange ou account of Government bureaus is shown in detail in the follow-
ing table:

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE,

I beg to call attention to the unsatisfactory state of the exchange relations with
several countries, a condition of affairs which can perhaps in some instances be
remedied by proper representations through diplomatic channels. The transmission
of exchanges to Greece has been entirely suspended, a letter having been received
from the librarian of the United National and University Libraries, formerly acting
as the medium for distributing publications, requesting that with the exception of '
their own exchanges no further boxes be forwarded, on account of the expense
attending the distribution of the packages. Correspondence has been opened with
a view to establishing a new exchange relation, but so far without success. All
transmissions to Brazil and Chile were for a time suspended, owing to the unsettled
condition of these countries. With Mexico our exchange relations are also extremely
unsatisfactory. Correspondents in Nicaragua meet with what would seem to be
unreasonable delay in receiving packages addressed to them, and I regret to state
that the Government authorities at Calcutta have declined to receive and dispatch
packages addressed to other than Government officials. On the other hand, very
efficient international exchange bureaus are now under Government auspices in
New South Wales and Uruguay.

Referring to clerical details of the office work, it seems desirable to keep before
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

the minds of Smithsonian correspondents the system of accounting for the material,
often of considerable value, that passes through the exchange office.

Under the name of each individual or society sending or receiving a package
through the exchange bureau, an account of all such packages is kept, with the date
of transmission and of acknowledgment. It was found possible to abbreviate some-
whatthe records made upon the cards used for the purpose, and a much smaller card
was brought into use on January 1, 1892, thereby greatly facilitating the work of
the record room. <A further saving was effected by giving the ‘‘invoice numbers”
only for the packages upon the receipt cards transmitted with the packages, as a
means of identification. Attention is called by a printed notice upon the outside of
the package to this invoice number, which must be carefully compared with that
upon the receipt card, and the latter is to be returned promptly. All these receipts
are carefully arranged and filed.

Only by such abbreviation of the records was it possible to carry the exchange
work through the year in the face of a curtailed appropriation by Congress. The
clerical force was reduced by dropping three clerks and two packers from the roll,
though at the end of the year, when the deficiency appropriation became available,
a part of the force was temporarily restored, to be again reduced when the fiscal year
closed.

Notwithstanding these reductions 4,036 more packages were handled during 1892-
93 than in the previous year, and at the end of June only 73 packages remained on
hand.

I take much pleasure in bearing witness to the efficiency of the employés in the
exchange office and in expressing appreciation of their efforts to keep up with the
added volume of work in spite of the unavoidable reduction in the force to handle
it, and I beg leave to call to your notice the careful attention to the interests of the
Institution on the part of its special agents abroad, Dr. Felix Fliigel, in Leipzig, and
Messrs. William Wesley & Son, in London. ‘

Grateful acknowledgments are also due to the following transportation compa-
nies and others for their continued liberality in granting the privilege of free freight
or in otherwise assisting in the transmission of exchange parcels and boxes, while
to other firms thanks are due for reduced rates of transportation in consideration of
the disinterested services of the Institution in the diffusion of knowledge.

APPENDIX IV.

REPORT OF THE ACTING MANAGER OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
PARK FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1893.

Str: Ihave the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the
National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893.

By act of Congress dated August 5, 1892, the sum of $50,000 was appropriated to
maintain and improve the park. As no provision was made by this act for the pur-
chase of animals, calculations were made as to the cost of maintaining the collection
already on hand and plans for further improvement were based upon the balance
then available. The buffalo, elk, and other native wild animals have naturally
received the most attention. Effort has been made to place them as far as possible
in natural conditions by extending the paddocks assigned to them. While it has
not been practicable to give them large ranges, many acres in extent, as was at
first intended, since it is now found desirable that they be kept where they can be
readily viewed by the public, yet the inclosures are of considerable size. The
accompanying engraving represents a group of buffalo now in the Park.

In the preceding year it was necessary to place in the large animal house the
animals requiring heat, although that house was still in an unfinished state. During
the present year it has been completed, except the outer cages, and a tile roof
has been substituted for the temporary one. The plans for the house contem-
plated additions to the main structure, and as more room was urgently needed and
the available funds were insufficient for a stone addition, a frame extension has been
built conforming to the original plan in size and form. A row of permanent cages
occupies either side of this extension and a large tank in the middle of the room
accommodates aquatic animals. By this means it has been possible to give the animals
comfortable and suitable quarters where they can be easily seen by the public. It
is, however, a matter of great regret that the entire structure was not built of stone
and nothing but pressing necessity can excuse the erection of the present extension.

On the meadow upon the right bank of the creek paddocks have been inclosed
and a small thatched barn built to shelter a small herd of Hamas. These animals
were purchased last year in South America through the kindness of Col. W, P.
Tisdel, of the Bureau of American Republics.

The plan submitted by the landscape architects provided for a large pond for
waterfowl and other aquatic animals at the bend of the creek below the bridge.
This pond has been excavated, but fencing and shelters are needed before animals
can be put in it.

The principal road through the park was last year completed only to the hill in
front of the buffalo house. From this point to the park limit, near Connecticut
Avenue Extended, an old wood road had been used, but it was of too steep a grade.
A new road has therefore been projected and begun. This road will wind around
the spurs of the hill sloping downward toward Rock Creek, bringing to view some
of the most beautiful natural scenery of the park, and as it will lead by easy and
gradual ascent toward the roads that connect the western. entrance with the Wood-
ley road it can not fail to be a favorite and much frequented drive.

There is great need of some easier access to the park than now exists. From the

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Sy)

Rock Creek Railway at either end of the park to the animal house is half a mile,
and from the Fourteenth street car line a still greater distance. This is a serious
inconvenience to many people, particularly the aged and infirm, who have only
this means of reaching the park. For carriages the Quarry road is far too narrow
and very steep, the grade being 9 per cent in some places.

During the year the District authorities improved this road considerably, prop-
erly grading and guttering it and building a suitable sidewalk. While this is a
great improvement, the grade of the road is such that it can never be suitable for a
principal avenue of access. It is possible that when the projected improvement of
Kenesaw avenue is completed that some amelioration of this condition may ensue.
There seems to be no reason why street cars should not find ready access to the park
by this route.

The unexpected number of visitors made it essential to increase the capacity of
the bridge and to protect foot passengers who use it. Footways have accordingly
been added to the original structure. These are not wideenough to properly accom-
modate the public, but are as wide as is consistent with the safety of the structure.

The offices of the park remain in the dilapidated house known as the Holt man-
sion. When the park was first projected it was expected that the superintendent
would reside on the premises, and this building seemed to offer a suitable residence.
The experience of the last two years has shown that that plan was a wise one.
There should undoubtedly be some one always at hand in the park to respond to
any calls that may be made in an emergency. Besides this the park is never closed
to the public, andit is therefore desirable that the Superintendent should be always
accessible. During the past year several valuable deer have been attacked by dogs
during the night and either worried to death or injured so that they had to be
killed.

A list of the animals now in the park is herewith submitted, together with state-
ments of those that have been received from various sources. A few animals have
been presented, among the most notable being two fine wolf-hounds from Southern
Russia by Mr. Byron G. Daniels, U.S. consul at Hull, England; an alligator over
10 feet in length by Mr. E. 8. Schmidt, of this city, and a black wolf by Mr. R. M.
Middleton, jr., of South Pittsburg, Tenn. These gifts are properly appreciated, yet
itis found that increases from such sources can not be depended on to keep up
the collection.

From the Yellowstone National Park 17 animals were received. These were kept
at that park for some time before shipment, and were then transported by freight,
in charge of a keeper. Unless animals can be obtained in greater numbers it will
be found that this is a very expensive and precarious method of obtaining them.

A few animals have been loaned, notably a tiger, by Mr. J. T. McCaddon, manager
of the Adam Forepaugh shows, and a zebu by Mr. A. E. Randle, of this city. These
are subject to recall by their owners. Although such animals do not become the
property of the park, yet an opportunity is afforded of exhibiting them for a con-
siderable time for the mere expense of their care and feeding.

The provisions of the appropriation were such that no animals could be purchased
during the year, and a number of fine opportunities for acquiring specimens was
thus lost.

A few animals were born in the park, among which were a bison, a deer, two elk,
and a Hama.

The losses by death have been considerable, amounting to as much as 20 per cent
of the entire collection.

The total number of animals now on hand is 504, being an increase of 56 over the
number on hand at the first of the year.

APPENDIX V.
ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

At present the astro-physical observatory is under the immediate direction of
the Secretary, but owing to the pressure of other occupations, the conduct of the
work in detail has lain largely in the hands of Mr. F. L. O. Wadsworth, who
received the appointment of senior assistant on October 10, and to whose efficient aid
the Secretary is pleased to acknowledgé his obligation.

The general work of the observatory for the year has pertained to the investiga-
tion of the infra-red portion of the spectrum, briefly referred to last year, and
described in general in the body of my report. It may conveniently be classified
under three general heads:

A. General spectro-bolographice work.

B. Special spectro-bolographic work.

C. Instrumental work, including manufacture of new apparatus and the
perfection of old.

A. The general bolographie work of the year, (which can be carried on only when
the sky is unobseured by clouds or haze), is summed up as follows:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

Complete records of all of these bolographic curves have been kept in the book
specially provided for that purpose, and from them by another automatic process are
produced the linear spectra of which an illustration follows. As elsewhere stated,
the result of the year’s work has been the discovery and approximate determination
of position of about 150 or 200 new lines in this hitherto almost unexplored region.

The accompanying illustration of one of the ‘‘rock-salt” spectra of the invisible
spectrum obtained by the new process is intended to give a general, if crude, idea of
the novelty, the extent, and (it may be hoped) the value, of this field of labor.

The visible solar spectrum, first investigated by Sir Isaac Newton, is represented
as to its length by the blank space on the left; the number .4 (i. e., the part where
wave-length is four-tenths of a micron) and .8 (i. e., the part where wave-length is
eighth-tenths of a micron) representing the extremities of the solar spectrum as
known to him.

Below this all is invisible, and the investigations made at this Observatory by the
novel bolometric methods here referred to have been chiefly instrumental in carrying
the mapping of lines to 6.0 (six microns), or through nearly thirteen times the extent
known to Newton. The great majority of all the lines which fill this space have
been discovered and laid down by the new bolometric method, and most of them
herein Washington during the last two years.

B. The special bolographic work, which is carried on during the cloudy weather.
during which the regular work is necessarily interrupted, includes the classification,
detailed examination, and, finally, the reduction of the bolographs taken to linear
representatives of the infra-red spectrum, in which the final result is a line photo-
graph which is precisely similar, as far as automatic reduction processes will admit,
to the line spectrum photographs of the visible part of the spectrum. Owing tothe
labor involved in this reduction it has been deemed desirable to apply this process
of reduction only to the best of the bolographs taken. The result of this portion of
the work is briefly summed up as follows:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

While this number seems small in comparison with the whole number of bolo-
graphs taken, it nevertheless represents even more work. In this particular work
the history of the year is one of continual change and improvement and many of
the bolographs of the earlier part of the year have been reduced by three different
processes, each of which involves three distinct photographic steps, and in conse-
quence the 39 final line spectrum photographs stand for more than 200 finished
photographs, and as many more which are experimental.

After a large amount of experimental work, a process has finally been perfected
which is fairly satisfactory, and has been adopted provisionally as a working
method. Experiments, however, are still in progress with a view to further modifi-
cation and improvement.

In addition to this bolometric work proper, experiments on three special methods
of investigation of the infra-red spectrum, have formed a considerable portion of
the year’s work:

(1) Preliminary experiments on the measurement of wave-lengths in the invisible
spectrum by interference methods.

(2) Experiments on photographing the invisible spectrum by the aid of phos-
phorescent films.

(3) Preliminary experiments on bolometric investigation of the infra-red normal
(grating) spectrum.

I. During the month of July, 1892, a series of preliminary experiments was made
on a method of measurement of wave-lengths in the invisible spectrum, with special
reference to the establishment of a few datum points with great accuracy. The
apparatus employed for this purpose, which was kindly lent by Clark University,
was a modification of the inferential wave comparer used with so much success by
Prot. Michelson, in the establishment of a wave-length standard.

As the method of working was entirely new, considerable time was required to
put the apparatus in working order. Some preliminary results were obtained in
the region just above “ A,” by Mr. Wadsworth, in whose hands I placed it, but the
work was interrupted by his departure for Paris, and has not since been resumed.
The accuracy and practicability of this method of determining wave-lengths has,
however, been demonstrated, and it is hoped time will be found in the near future
to continue this work.

II. During the month of October I made a number of experiments to determine
the practicability of photographing the infra-red spectrum directly with the aid of
phosporescent films.

After considerable experimentation on the best method of working, a number of
photographs of the invisible portion of the spectrum extending as far as wave-length
1:5 « were thus obtained. Although the detail is very much less than that obtained
by the bolometer, the method is valuable in furnishing a general check on the
results of the more analytical method. With greater care in the preparation of
films, still better resuls could be obtained. Other films sensitive to heat rays were
tried, particularly those containing a salt of mereury, but without adequate results.

II. During the winter months of January and February, in which regular bolo-
metric work was almost entirely interrupted by bad weather, attention was devoted
to the theoretical investigation of a method of bolometrically investigating the nor-
mal grating spectrum, the essential feature of which was the employment of a
“lifting” prism, by the use of which the superposed spectra were to be avoided.

After determination of the best instrumental conditions, provisional apparatus

yas constructed and installed, and a few experimental bolographs taken. The
approach of good observing weather then necessitated its removal. A paper
describing the method and containing the essential results of the investigation of
the instrumental conditions has been prepared for publication.

C. What might almost be said to have been the chief work of the Observatory for
the year has been the improvement of the apparatus and instrumental conditions
of working,
64 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The lines of development have been: (1) In the increase of delicacy; (2) in the
increase of stability and accuracy.

With a view to increased delicacy much time has been devoted through the year
to the improvement of the galvanometer.

During the absence in Europe of the present senior assistant, he, by my direction,
devoted two weeks exclusively to this work, and the elements of three galvanometers
were constructed after his design, two by Nalder Bros. and one by Elliott Bros.
After his return, the work of improvement of my earlier designs for the old galvan-
ometer and of the new ones was at once begun. Pending the completion of the new
galvanometers, the improvement of the three old ones already in use was undertaken,
and the delicacy of each was more than doubled. Up to date only one of the new
galvanometers has been completed, and this owing to the introduction of an almost
unprecedentedly light, magnetic system, and through other improvements, has been
found to be about 35 times more delicate than the best of these previously in use.

This degree of delicacy will, it is probable, be exceeded by one of the two remain-
ing forms, but lack of time has prevented further improvement at present. Indeed
the conditions of use at present are such as to render only about one-tenth of this
increased delicacy available, and only a new laboratory will enable the full increase
of delicacy to be perfectly utilized.

An abbreviated statement of the galvanometer work for the year is appended:

j Partially finished.

For use in these new galyanometers, the laboratory has received during the year,
alot of very fine quartz fibers, made to special order by Prof. C. C. Hutchins, and
some very small, light, and accurate concave mirrors from J. A. Brashear, the use of
which in the new galvyanometer has been already referred to. A very considerable
improvement in the mechanical steadiness of this part of the apparatus has also been
effected by mounting the whole galvanometer in a massive metal case, which rests
on a series of stone blocks placed one above another and separated from each other
by sheets of rubber. In spite of these precautions, the vibrations due to passing
teams and wagons are at times still very troublesome.

(2) The improvement in the other parts of the apparatus has been mainly in the
direction of increased accuracy. The siderostat has been provided with a new elec-
tric control, by means of which inaccuracies of running may be quickly compensated
for from inside the building. Considerable improvement has also been effected in
the minor parts of the instrument, but it still needs to be thoroughly overhauled.
The changes for which there is most pressing need are the remounting of the
equatorial axis on ball bearings and the construction of a new governor for the clock.

The spectro-bolometer and its accessories is that part of the train of apparatus
which has undergone the most radical change. The principal changes which have
been made in its construction and working during the past year are:

(1) The adoption of a reflecting mirror secured to the prism and revolving with
it, which has rendered it possible to fix both the spectro-bolometer slit and the
bolometer itself in position, thereby avoiding the use of a long revolving arm,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 65

This device permits of indefinite extension of the bolometer arm, and consequently
the reduction of the angular value of the bolometer strip to a very minute quantity.

(2) The provision of a new adjustable tangent arm for slowly rotating the axis
of the spectro-bolometer with great accuracy.

(3) The adoption of a new system of clock-work for synchronously driving this
tangent arm, and the photographic plate on which the galvanometer record is
taken, in place of the two independent driving clocks before used.

(4) The mounting of all parts of the spectro-bolometer on rigid iron or stone
supports.

The improvements in the method of working which have accompanied these
improvements in apparatus are:

(1) The substitution of glass plates for flexible films for the photographic records.
The irregular errors due to shrinkage of the film have thus been eliminated and the
subsequent photographic processes rendered much easier by reason of the greater
facility of handling.

(2) The reduction, and in some cases almost entire elimination, of the “drift” by
the use of a water-jacket about the fixed bolometer case, together with careful
attention to all the electrical details of the bolometer and galvanometer connections,
‘and the substitution of storage battery cells for the Daniel cells, formerly used to
supply the current to the bridge circuit. The ‘‘ drift,” however, still remains a
source of great trouble and I expect to secure its elimination only (if at all) by the
establishment of uniform temperature conditions, which it is impossible to obtain in
the present laboratory (at least during the summer months).

The laboratory building itself has been considerably improved during the past
year. A small annex, which is used as a photographic dark room, was erected in
the spring of 1895, and has greatly facilitated the photographic work of the obser-
vatory. During the summer a small air-cooling plant was placed in the basement,
and served not only to increase the comfort of the observers, but also to secure
more favorable conditions for the work then being carried on with rock salt.

During the past year the observatory also fitted up a small instrument shop for
the construction and repair of its apparatus, comprising an instrument-maker’s
lathe, built to my special order, a small planer from the Hendley Machine Company,
and a fairly complete stock of small tools, and stock material. A dynamo, for sup-
plying current to the observatory for charging the storage batteries and to the shop
for power purposes, was also purchased and temporarily placed in the National
Museum. Owing to the lack of suitable quarters the shop has not yet been perma-
nently located, but occupies a temporary shed south of the Smithsonian building.

The important pieces of apparatus acquired during the year may be divided into
two general classes: (1) Physical apparatus of precision; (2) accessory apparatus.

I. To the former class belongs:

(1) Three new galvanometers and sets of galvanometer coils from Elliott
Brothers and Nalder Brothers.
(2) Resistance boxes one of 100,000 ohms and one of 1,000 ohms from Nalder
Brothers.
(3) A set of fine quartz fibers, from Prof. C. C. Hutchins.
(4) Six fine galvanometer mirrors, from J. A. Brashear.
(5) One large glass prism, from J. A. Brashear.
(6) Two large glass lenses, from J. A. Brashear.
(7) Two new large rock salt lenses, from M. E. Kahler.
(8) A collection of valuable rock salt crystals, from Germany.
(9) Three new \5-milometer bolometers, from Grunow.
(10) One large 24-inch camera, a fine Ross lens, and a complete photographic
outfit, from Scoville & Co.
(11) A new tangent arm for spectro-bolometer, from J. A. Brashear.
(12) A new prism holder, with large glass flat, from J. A. Brashear.

66 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

II. Accessory apparatus:

(1) A complete instrument-maker’s lathe, with outfit of tools and chucks.

(2) A 30-inch hand and power planer for metal work, with chuck, ete., from
the Hendley Machine Company.

(3) A 40-light incandescent dynamo, with rheostats, etc., from Westing-
house Electric Company.

(4) A one-half horse power motor, from Akron Electric Company.

(5) A one-fourth horse-power water motor and Sturtevant pressure fan, with
accessory apparatus for cooling the air of the Observatory.

The total value of the apparatus purchased during the year was about $3,000.

MINOR WORK OF THE YEAR.

In addition to Mr. Wadsworth’s work with Prof. Michelson in the establishment
of the length of the standard meter in terms of the wave length of light, at the
International Bureau of Weights and Measures, reference to which has already been
made, the following special work, which has been done during the year, may be
mentioned:

(1) The preparation of a complete series of line-shaded drawings of the principal
pieces of apparatus in the observatory on a scale requisite to show their detailed
construction. 2

(2) The preparation of a series of enlargements of moon photographs from the
Kenwood and Lick observatories, photographs.

(3) Experiments in temperature and radiation work.

During the latter part of the year preliminary experiments were begun and carried
on at intervals looking to the systematic preparation for another extended research,
which I have proposed to soon begin to determine the physical relation between
temperature and radiation. The experiments have mostly-.been directed to the
establishment of a satisfactory source of temperature and means of measuring the
same. The various apparatus, etc., for the prosecution of this work at an early date
has either been ordered or already installed.

(4) Some further attempts have been made at solar photography, but, as the
experience of last year conclusively showed, the atmospheric conditions here in the
city are very unfavorable to any satisfactory work in this direction.

PERSONNEL.

The force of the Observatory consists of a Senior assistant, and an instrument-
maker, and an assistant instrument-maker. During the past year the Observatory
has also had at different times special assistants, among whom I wish to acknowl-
edge the assistance of Mr. J. G. Hubbard, to whose photographic skill several
improvements of this part of the work are due.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1893.

Sir: I have the honor to submit herewith a report upon the operations of the
library of the Smithsonian Institution during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1893.

The work of recording accessions has been conducted as in the preceding years.
The entry numbers in the accession book extend from 246, 110 to 268, 386.

The following table shows the number of volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets,
and charts received during the year:

Of these publications, 272 volumes, 6,981 parts of volumes, and 821 pamphlets,
8,074 in all, were retained for use in the U. 8. National Museum.

Nine hundred and sixty-three medical dissertations were deposited in the library
of the Surgeon-General U. 8. Army; the remaining publications were sent to the
Library of Congress on the Monday after their receipt.

In carrying out the plan formulated by the Secretary for increasing the library
by exchanges, 781 letters asking for publications not on our list, or askingefor num-
bers to complete the series already in the library, have been written. It gives me
pleasure to report that as a result of this correspondence 246 new exchanges were
acquired by the Institution, while 81 defective series were completed, either wholly
or as far as the publishers were able to supply missing parts.

Since this plan of the Secretary was first formulated in 1887, 4,512 letters have
been written with a view of increasing tho number of periodicals and transactions
of learned societies in the library of the Smithsonian Institution. The result of
this work has been most gratifying; 1,550 new periodicals have been added to the
list and 909 defective series have been either completed or filled out as far as the
publishers were able to supply missing parts.

The reading room is now taxed to its utmost capacity; the 494 boxes for the use
of, scientific periodical literature are all filled and periodicals which it would be
desirable to keep in the gencral reading room must be placed clsewhere for lack of
space. The reading room no longer has sufficicnt accommodations for the growing
exchanges of the Institution nor for the persons desiring to consult this important
collection of current scientific literature.

Ever since 1890 the Secretary has called attention in his annual report to the fact
that the present quarters of the library are insufficient; the natural expansion of
the library has been prevented by the fact that the rooms adjacent to the library
were occupied by the bureau of international exchanges. It will be possible shortly
to assign other quarters to the bureau of international exchanges, and plans have
been prepared for book shelves in one of the rooms made vacant. It is estimated
that space will thus be secured for about 6,000 volumes,

In addition to the strictly scientific literature \;hich is contained in the reading

employés of the Institution and tho National Museum is constantly increasing.

Below is a comparative statement of the operations of the library since June 30,
1890:

It will be observed that this comparative table shows a slight decrease in the
number of publications received during the current year over the preceding year.
The decrease, however, is in volumes, and is due to the fact that the limit of the
possibility of completing series of publications by exchange, seems to have been
reached.

The number of titles for the past year shows an increase of almost 2,000 over that
of the year preceding.

The following table shows the number of titles received per year for the past six
years:

It will be seen from the above table that the number of titles received by the
library has almost doubled since 1887, a gratifying fact, yet one which severely
taxes the library force in the recording and arrangement of the material received.

No fewer than 4,087 acknowledgments of publications were made by the post card
and other printed forms, while many gifts were acknowledged by special letter.

The following universities have sent complete sets of their academic publications,
including inaugural dissertations:

Basel, Greifswald, Louvain,

Berlin, Halle, A.5S., Lund,

Bern, Heidelburg, Marburg,

Bonn, Helsingfors, Strasburg, a
Breslau, Jena, Tiibingen,
Dorpat, Johns Hopkins, Utrecht,
Erlangen, Kiel, Wurzburg,
Freiburg, Br., Konigsberg, Zurich,

Giessen, Leipzig,

On July 1, 1892, Mr. J. Elfreth Watkins was appointed Assistant in charge of the
library, a position which he held until the first of October. From that date until
December 1, Mr. N. P. Scudder was acting Librarian.

Very respectfully, yours,
Cyrus ADLER,
Librarian.
Mr. 8S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENERAL APPENDIX

SMITHSONIAN REPORT FOR 1893.
ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by collab-
orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on
special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous correspond.
ents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law, with memoirs illustrating the more remarka
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its Listory, been
carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would possess
an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the promi-
nent features.of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology, meteor-
ology, physies, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zodlogy, and anthropol-
ogy. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether satistac-
torily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion. This method has been continued in the present report, for 1893.

THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLKE.*

By Sir RoBERT BALL, F. R. 8.

On a recent visit to Cambridge, Prof. Barnard, the discoverer of the
fifth satellite of Jupiter, exhibited at the Cavendish Laboratory his most
interesting collection of photographs made at the Lick Observatory.
These pictures were obtained by a 6-inch photographic lens of 3 feet
focus, attached to an ordinary equatorial, the telescope of which was
used as a guider when it was desired to obtain a picture of the stars
with a long exposure. Among the advantages of this process may be
reckoned the large field that is thereby obtained, many of the plates that
he exhibited being as much as 4 degrees on the edge. I am however
not now going to speak of Barnard’s marvellous views of the milky way,
nor of the plate on which a comet was discovered, nor of the vicissitudes
of Holmes’s comet, nor of that wonderful picture in which Swift’s comet
actually appears to be producing, by a process of gemmation, an off-
shoot which is evidently adapted for an independent cometary exist-
ence. The picture to which I wish specially to refer in connection with
our immediate subject is one in which the instrument was directed
towards the celestial pole. In this particular case the clock-work which
is ordinarily employed to keep the stars acting at the same point of the
plate was dispensed with. The telescope, in fact, remained fixed while
the heavens rotated in obedience to the diurnal motion. Under these
circumstances each star, as minute after minute passed by, produced
an image on a different part of the plate, the consequence of which was
that the record which the star was found to have left, when the picture
was developed, was that of a long trail instead of a sharply defined
point. As each star appears to describe a circle in the sky around the
pole, and as, in the vicinity of the pole, these circles were small enough
to be included in the plate, this polar photograph exhibits a striking
spectacle. It displayed a large number of concentric circles, or rather,
I should say, of portions of circles, for the exposures having lasted for
about four hours, about one-sixth of each circumference was completed
during that time.

76 THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE.

The effect thus produced was that of a number of circular ares of
varying sizes and of different degrees of brightness. Most conspiecu-
ous amongst them was the trail produced by the actual polar star
itself. It is well known, of course, that though the situation of the
pole is conveniently marked by the fortunate circumstance that a
bright star happened during the present century to le in the immedi-
ate vicinity of the veritable pole, yet, of course, this star is not actually
at the pole, and consequently, like all the other stars, Polaris itself
must be revolving in a circle whereof the center lies at the true pole.
The brighter the star the brighter is the trail which it produces, so
that the circle made by Polaris is much more conspicuous than the
circles produced by the other stars of inferior luster. It is however
to be noted that some of the faint stars lie much closer to the pole than
Polaris itself. There is indeed one very minute object so close to the
pole that the circle in which its movements are performed seems very
little more than a point when represented on the screen on which the
shde was projected. The interesting circumstance was noted that there
ajipeared to be occasional interruptions to the continuity of the circular
ares. This was due to the fact that clouds had interposed during the
intervals represented by the interruptions. A practical application is
thus suggested, which has been made to render useful service at Har-
vard College Observatory. Every night, and all night long, a plate is
there exposed to this particular part of the sky, and the degree in
which the Pole-star leaves a more or less complete trail affords an indi-
cation of the clearness or cloudiness of the sky throughout the course
ot the night. From the positions of the parts where the trail has been
interrupted it is possible not only to learn the amount of cloudiness
that has prevailed, but the particular hours during which it has lasted.
This interesting system of concentric polar circles affords us perhaps
the most striking visual representation that could possibly be obtained
of the existence of that point in the heavens which we know as the
pole. The picture thus exhibited was a striking illustration of the
Copernican doctrine that the diurnal stellar movement was indeed only
apparent, being of course due to the rotation of the earth on its axis.

Suppose that a photograph, like that I have been describing, were to
be taken at intervals of a century, it would be found that the center
of the system of circles, that is to say, the veritable pole itself, was
gradually changing on the heavens. I do not by this mean that the
stars themselves would be found to have shifted their places relatively
to each other. No doubt there is some effect of this kind, but it is an
insignificant one, and need not at present concern us. The essential
point to be noticed is, that the stars which happen to le in the vicinity
of the pole would have a changed relation to the pole in consequence
of the fact that this latter point is itself in incessant movement. At
the present time the pole is advancing in such a direction that it is
getting nearer to the Pole-star, so that the actual circle which the Pole-
THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE. layaaey

star is describing is becoming less and less. The time will come when
the circle which this star performs will have reached its lowest dimen-
sions, but still the pole will be moving on its way, and then, of course,
the dimensions of the circle traversed by the Pole-star will undergo a
corresponding increase. As hundreds of years and thousands of years
roll by the pole will retreat farther and farther from the Pole-star, so
that in the course of a period as far on in the future as the foundation
of Rome was in the past, the pole will be no longer sufficiently near
the Pole-star to enable the latter to render to astronomers the peculiar
services which it does at present.

Looking still farther ahead, we find that in the course of about twelve
thousand years the pole will have gained a position as remote as it
possibly can from that position which it now occupies. This most eriti-
eal point in the heavens will then le not far from the star Vega, the
brightest point in the northern sky, and then it will commence to return,
so that after the lapse of about twenty-five thousand years the pole
will be found again in the same celestial neighborhood where it is
to-night, having, 1n the meantime, traversed a mighty circle through the
constellations. In all this there is no novelty; these movements-of the
pole are so conspicuous that they were detected long before the intro-
duction of accurate instruments. They were discovered so far back as
the time of Hipparchus, and the cause of them was assigned by New-
ton as one of the triumphs of his doctrine of universal gravitation. In
giving the title of ** The Wanderings of the North Pole” to this paper
I did not however intend to discourse of the movements to which I
have hitherto referred. They are so familiar that every astronomer has
to attend to them practically in the reduction of almost every observa-
tion of the place of the celestial body. It was however necessary to
make the reference which I have done to this subject in order that the
argument on which we are presently to enter should be made suffi-
ciently clear. It must be noted that the expression “the North Pole”
is ambiguous. It may mean either of two things, which are quite dis-
tinct. In the case we have already spoken of, I understand by the
North Pole that point on the celestial sphere which is the center of the
system of concentric circles described by the cireumpolar stars. The
other sense in which the North Pole is used is the terrestrial one; it
denotes that point on this earth which has been the goal of so many
expeditions, and to reach which has been the ambition of so many illus-
trious navigators. We have a general notion that the terrestrial North
pole lies in a desolate region of eternal ice, somewhat relieved by the
circumstance that for six months of the year the frozen prospect is
brightened by perpetual day, though on the other hand, during the
remaining six months of the year this region is the abode of perpetual
night.

The North Pole is that bitherto unattainable point on our globe on
which, if an observer could take lis station, he would find that the
1S THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE.

phenomena of the rising and the setting of the stars, so familiar. eise-
where, were non-existent. Each star viewed from the coign of vantage
offered by the North Pole would move round and round in a horizontal
circle, and the system of concentric circles would be directly overhead.
In midsummer the sun would seem to revolve around, remaining prac-
tically at the same elevation above the horizon for a few days, until it
slowly began to wend its way downwards ina spiral. In a couple of
months it would draw near the horizon, and as day after day passed
by the luminary would descend lower and lower until its edge grazed
the horizon all round. Thesetting-of the sun for the long winter would
then be about to commence, and gradually less and less of the disk
would remain perceptible. Finally the sun would disappear altogether,
though for many days afterwards a twilight glow would travel round
the whole hemisphere, ever getting less and less, until at last all indi-
cations of the sun had vanished. The utter darkness of winter would
then ensue for months, mitigated only so far as celestial luminaries
were concerned by starlight or occasional moonlight. Doubtless, how-
ever, the fitful gleams of the aurora would often suffice to render the
surrounding desolation visible. Then as the spring drew. near, if,
indeed, such a word as spring be at all applicable to an abode of utter
dreariness, a faint twilight wouid be just discernible. The region thus
illuminated would move round and round the horizon each twenty-four
hours, gradually becomin g more and more conspicuous, until at last the
edge of the sun appeared. Then, by aspiral movement inverse to that
with which its descent was accomplished, the great luminary would
steal above the horizon, there to continue for a period of six months
until the commencement of the ensuing winter. Indeed, the actual
duration of apparent summer would be somewhat protracted in conse-
quence of the effect of refraction in raising the sun visually above the
horizon when in reality it was still below. The result would be to
lengthen the summer at one end and to anticipate it at the other.
Such would be the astronomical conditions of the North Pole; that
anomalous point, from whence every other locality on the globe lies due
south, that nysterious point which up to the present seems never to
have been approached by man within.a distance less than 400 miles,
unless, indeed, as is not improbably the case, the pre-glacial man who
lived in the last genial period found a temperate climate and enjoyable
conditions even at the latitude of 90°.

For our present purpose it will be necessary to get a very clear idea
as to the precise point on the earth which we mean when we speak of
the North Pole. Asour knowledge of it is almost entirely derived from
astronomical phenomena, it is necessary to assign the exact locality of
the pole by a strict definition depending on astronomical facts. Sup-
posing that Nansen does succeed in his expedition, as everyone hopes
that he will, and does penetrate within that circle of 400 miles radius
where the foot of civilized man has never yet trod, how is he to identify
THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE. (i)

that particular spot on this globe which is to be defined by the North
Pole? It was for this purpose that at the commencement of this paper
I referred to that photograph of the concentrie circles which illustrated
so forcibly the position of the pole in the heavens. Imagine that your
eye was placed at the center of the earth, and that you had a long slen-
der tube from that center to the surface through which you could look
out at the celestial sphere; if that tube be placed in such a way that,
when looking from the center of the earth through this tube, your vision
was directed exactly to that particular point of the heavens which is
the center of the circle now described by the Pole Star and the other
circumpolar stars, then that spot in which the end of the tube passes
out through the surface of the earth is the North Pole. Imagine a
stake to be driven into the earth at the place named, then the position
of that stake is the critical spot on our globe whieh has been the object
of so much scientific investigation and of so much maritime enterprise.
The reader must not think that [am attempting to be hyper-accurate
in this definition of the North Pole; no doubt, in our ordinary language
we often think of the pole as something synonymous with the polar
regions, an ill-defined and most vaguely known wilderness of ice. For
scientific purposes it is, however, essential to understand that the pole
is a very definitely marked point, and we must assign its position accu-
rately, not merely to within miles, but even to within feet. Indeed, it
is a truly extraordinary circumstance that, considering no one, with the
possible exception just referred to, has ever yet been within so many
hundred miles of the pole, we should be able to locate it so precisely
that we are absolutely certain of its position to within an area not
larger than that covered by a small town, or even by a good-sized draw-
ing reom.

We have seen that the North Pole in the sky is in incessant move.
ment, and that the travels which it accomplishes in the course of many
centuries extend over a wide sweep of the heavens; this naturally sug.
gests the question, Does the pole in the earth move about in any simi-
lar manner, and if so, what is the nature and extent of its variation?
Here is the point about which those modern researches have been made
which it is my special object to discuss in this paper. Let us first see
clearly the issue that is raised. At the time of the building of the
Pyramids the pole in the heavens was in quite a different place from
its present position; the Pole Star had not at that time the slightest
title to be called a pole star; in fact, the point around which the heav-
ens revolved lay in a wholly different constellation. It was certainly
not far from the star Alpha Draconis about 3000 B. ¢., and we could
indicate its position quite definitely if we had any exact knowledge as
to the date of the Pyramids’ erection. It is, however, plain: that the
difference was so patent between the celestial pole at the time of the
Pyramids and the ceiestial pole of later eenturies, that it could not be
overlooked in attentive observation of the heavens, As the North
SOr THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE.

Pole in the sky was, therefore, so different in the time of the Pharaohs
from the North Pole in the time of Victoria, it is proper to ask whether
there was a like difference, or any difference at all, between the terres-
trial pole at the time of the building of the Pyramids and that terres-
trial pole in whose quest Nansen is just setting off. If Pharaoh had
despatched a successful expedition to the North Pole and driven a post
in there to mark it, and if Nansen were now successful, would he find
that the North Pole in the earth which he was to mark oceupied the
same position or a different position from that which had been discov-
ered thousands of years previously? At first one might hastily say
that there must be such a difference, for it will be remembered that I
have defined the North Pole in the earth as that point through which
the tube passes which would permit an eye placed at the center of the
earth to view the North Pole in the sky. If, therefore, the North Pole
in the sky had undergone a great change in its position, it might seem
obvious that the tube from the earth’s center to its surface which would
now conduct the vision from that centre to the north celestial pole
would emerge at a different point of the earth’s crust from that which
it formerly oceupied. We have here to deal with the case that arises
not unfrequently in astronomy, in which a fact of broad general truth
requires a minute degree of qualification; indeed, it is not too much to
say that itis in this qualification of broad general truths that many of
the greatest discoveries in physical science have consisted. And such
is the case in the present instance. There is a broad general truth and
there is the qualification of it. It is the qualification that constitutes
the essential discovery which it is my object herein to set forth. But
before doing so it will be necessary for me to lay down the broad gen-
eral truth that the North Pole of the earth as it existed in the time of
the Pharaohs appears to be practically the same as the North Pole of
the earth now. It seems perfectly certain that at any time within the
last ten thousand years the North Pole might have been found within
a region on the earth’s surface not larger than Hyde Park. Indeed,
the limits might be drawn much more closely. Itis quite possible that
many an edifice in London occupies an area sufficiently great to cover
the holes that would be made by all the posts that might be driven to
mark the precise sites of the North Pole on the earth not only for the
the last five or ten thousand years, but probably for periods much
more ancient still. It is very likely that the North Pole at the time of
the glacial epoch was practically indistinguishable from the North
Pole now; in fact, the constancy, or sensible constancy I should, per-
haps, rather say, of the situation of this most critical point in our globe
is one of the most astonishing facts in terrestrial physics.

Let us, then, assume this broad general fact of the permanency in
the position of the North Pole, and deduce the obvious consequences it
imphes with regard to the earth’s movement. At this point we find
the convenience of the time-honored illustration in our geography books
THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE. 81

which likens the earth to an orange. Let us thrust a knitting needle
through the orange along its shortest diameter to represent the axis
about which the earth rotates. Not only does the earth perform one
revolution about this axis in the space of each sidereat day, but the
axis itself has a movement. If the earth’s axis always remained fixed,
or never had any motion except in a direction parallel to itself, then the
point to which it was directed on the sky would never change. We
have however seen that the pole in the sky is incessantly altering its
position; we are therefore taught that the direction of the earth’s axis
of rotation is constantly changing. To simulate the movement by the
orange and knitting needle, we must imagine the orange to rotate
around its axis once in that period of twenty-three hours and fifty six
minutes which is well known as the length of the sidereal day; while at
the same time the knitting needle, itself bearing, of course, the orange
with it, performs a conical movement with such extreme slowness that
not less than twenty-five thousand years is occupied in making the cir-
cuit. The movement, as has often been pointed out, is like that of a
peg top which rotates rapidly on its axis while at the same time the
axis itself has a slow revolving motion. Thus the phenomena which
are presented in the rotation of the earth demonstrate that the axis
about which the earth rotates occupies what is, at all events, approx-
imately a fixed position in the earth, though not a fixed position in
space. We can hardly be surprised at this result; if merely implies
that the earth acts like a rigid body on the whole, and does not permit
the axis about which it is turning to change its position.

It will now be easily understood how it comes to pass that the posi-
tion of the North Pole upon the earth has not appreciably changed in
the course of thousands of years. The axis around which the earth
rotates has retained a permanent position relative to the earth itself;
it has however continuously changed, it is at this moment changing,
and it will continue to change with regard to its direction in space. So
far our knowledge extended up to within the last few years, but inthese
modern days a closer inquiry has been made into this, as into as many
other physical subjects, and the resuit has been to disclose the impor-
tant fact that, though the phenomena as just described are very nearly
true, they must receive a certain minute qualification. Complete exam-
ination of this subject is desirable, not only on account of its natural
importance, but also because it illustrates the refinements of which
modern astronomical processes are susceptible. I have stated the
broad general fact that the position of the terrestrial pole undergoes
no large or considerable fluctuation. But while weadmit that nolarge
fluctuation is possible, it is yet very proper to consider whether there
may not be asmall fluctuation. It is certain that the position of the
pole as it would be marked by a post driven into the earth to-day can
not differ by a mile from the position in which the same point would be
marked last year or next year. But does it differ at all? Is it abso-

SM 95——6
82 THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE.

lutely exactly the same? Would there be a difference, not indeed of
miles but of yards or of feet between the precise position of the pole on
the earth determined at successive intervals of time? Would it be the
same if we carried out our comparisons, not merely between one year
and another, but day after day, week after week, month after month?
No doubt the more obvious phenomena proclaim in the most unmistak-
able manner that the position of the pole is substantially invariable.
If therefore there be any fluctuations in its position, those could only
be disclosed by careful scrutiny of minute phenomena which were too
delicate to be detected in the coarser methods of observation. There
is indeed a certain presumption in favor of the notion that absolute
constancy in the position of the pole need not be expected. Almost
every statement of astronomical doctrine requires its qualification, and
it would seem indeed unlikely that when sufficient refinement was intro-
duced into the measurements the position of the polein the earth should
appear to be absolutely unalterable. Until a very recent period the
evidence on the subject was almost altogether negative; it was no
doubt recognized that there might be some fluctuations in the position
of the pole, but it was known that they would only be extremely small,
and it was believed that in all probability those fluctuations must be
comprised within those slender limits which are too much affected
by inevitable errors of observation to afford any reliable result. Per-
severance in this interesting inquiry has been at last rewarded; and
as in So many similar cases we are indebted to the labors of many inde-
pendent workers for the recent extension of our knowledge. We are,
however, at present most interested by the labors of Mr. Chandler, a
distinguished American astronomer, who hasmade an exhaustive exam-
ination into the subject. The result has been to afford a conclusive
proof that the terrestrial pole does undergo movement. Mr. Chandler
has been so successful as to have determined the law of those polar
movements, and he has found that when they are taken into consider-
ation, an important improvement in certain delicate astronomical inquir-
ies is the result. These valuable investigations merit, in the highest
degree, the attention, not only of those who are specially devoted to
astronomical and mathematical researches, but of that large and ever-
increasing class who are anxious for general knowledge with regard to
the physical phenomena of our globe.

At first sight it might seem difficult indeed to conduct the investi-
gation of this question. Here is a point on the earth’s surface, this
wonderful North Pole, which, so far as we certainly know, has never
yet been approached to within 400 miles, and yet we are so solicitous
about the position of this pole and about its movement that we demand
a knowledge of its whereabouts with an accuracy which at first appears
wholly unattainable. It sounds almost incredible when we are told
that a shift in the position of the North Pole to the extent of 20 yards,
or even 20 feet, is appreciable, notwithstanding that we have never
THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE. 83

been able to get nearer to it than from one end of England to the other.
Indeed, as a matter of fact, our knowledge of the movements of the
pole are derived from observations made not alone hundreds but even
many thousands of miles distant. It is in such observations as those
at Greenwich or Berlin, Pulkowa or Washington, that the determina-
tions have been made by which changes in the position of the pole can
be ascertained with a delicacy and precision for which those would
hardly be prepared who were not aware of the refinement of modern
astronomical methods. I do not however imply that the observations
condueting to the discoveries now about to be considered have been
exclusively obtained at the observatories I have named. There are a
large number of similar institutions over the globe which have been
made to bear their testimony. ‘Tens of thousands of different observa-
tions have been brought together, and by discussing them it has been
found possible to remove a large part of the errors by which such work
is necessarily affected, and to elicit from the vast mass those grains of
truth which could not have been discovered had it not been for the
enormous amount of material that was available. Mr. Chandler has
discussed these matters in a remarkable series of papers, and it will be
necessary for me now to enter into some little detail, both as regards
the kind of observations that have been made, and the results to which
astronomers have been thereby conducted.

Greenwich Observatory lies more than 2,000 miles from the North
Pole, and yet if the pole were to shift by as much as the width of
Regent street, the fact that it had done so would be quite perceptible
at Greenwich. Let me endeavor to explain how such a measurement
could be achieved. In finding the latitude at any locality we desire,
of course, to know the distance between the locality and the equator,
expressed in angular magnitude. But though this is distinctly the
definition of latitude, it does not at onee convey the idea as to how
this element can be ascertained. How for instance would an astrono-
mer at Greenwich be able to learn the angular distance of the observa-
tory from the equator? The equator is not marked on the sky, and it
is obvious that the observer must employ a somewhat indirect process
to ascertain what he wants. Here, again, we have to invoke the aid
of that celestial pole to which I have so often referred. Think of that
point on the sky which is the common center of the circles exhibited
on Prof. Barnard’s photograph. That point is not indeed marked by
any special star, but it is completely defined by the circumstance that
it is the center of the track performed by the cireumpolar stars. We
thus obtain a clear idea of this definite point in the sky, and the hori-
zon is a perfectly definite line, at all events from any station where
the sea is visible. It is not difficult to imagine that by suitable meas-
urements we can ascertain the altitude of this point in the heavens
above the horizon. That altitude is the latitude of the place; it is, in
fact, the very angle which lies between the locality on the earth and
84 THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE.

the equator. It is quite true that as the pole is implied by these circles
rather than directly marked by them, the measurement of the altitude
can not be effected quite directly. The actual process is to take the
Pole star, or some one of the other circumpolar stars, and to measure
the greatest height to which it ascends above the horizon, and the
lowest altitude to which it declines about twelve hours later, The
former of these is as much above the pole as the latter is below it, so
between them we are able to ascertain the altitude of the pole witha
high degree of accuracy. It is true that in a fixed observatory such
as Greenwich there is no visible sea horizon, and even if there were
it would not provide so excellent a method as is offered by the equiv-
alent process of first observing the star directly and then observing
its reflection from a dish of mereury. In this way the altitude of the
star above the horizon is determined with the utmost precision.

The practical astronomer will however remember that of course he
has to attend to the effects of atmospheric refraction, which invariably
shows a star higher up than it ought to be. This can be allowed for,
and in this way the latitude of the observatory is ascertained with ail
needful accuracy. When the highest degree of precision is sought for,
and it is only observations with a very high degree of precision which
are available for our present purpose, a considerable number of stars
have to be employed, and very many observations have to be taken af
different seasons of the year so as to eliminate, as far as possible, all
sources of casual error. When, however, due attention has been paid
to those precautions which the experience of astronomers suggests, the
result that is obtained is characterized by extraordinary precision.
How great that precision may be I must endeavor to explan. The lati-
tude of every important observatory is obtained from a large number
of observations, and it would be unlikely that it was more than one or
two-tenths of a second different from the actual mean value. Nowa
tenth of a second on the surface of the earth corresponds to a distance
of about 10 feet, and this means that the latitude of the observatory, or,
as we must now speak very precisely, the latitude of the center of the
meridian circle in the observatory, is known to a degree of precision
represented by a few paces. It will thus be seen that with the aceu-
racy attainable in our modern observations, it would often be an appre-
ciable blunder to mistake the latitude of one wall of the observatory for
that of the opposite wall; in other words, we know accurately to within
the tenth of a second, or within not much more than the tenth of a see-
ond, the distance from the center of the transit circle at Greenwich,
down to the earth’s equator. But, of course, the distance from the
pole to the equator is 90°, and this being so it follows that the distance
from the north pole of the earth to the center of the transit cirele at
Greenwich Observatory has been accurately ascertained to within one
or two-tenths of a second. If any change took place in the distance
between the pole and the meridian circle at Greenwich, then it must be
THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE. 85

manifested by the changes of latitude. We shall now be able to under-
stand how any movement of the pole, or rather of the position which it
occupies in the earth, would be indicated at Greenwich. Suppose, for
instance, that the pole actually advanced towards Great Britain, and
‘that it moved toa distance of, let us say, 50 feet, the effect of this would
be to produce a diminution of the distance between the pole and Green-
wich, that is to say, there must be an increase in the distance from
Greenwich to the equator. This would correspond to a change in the
latitude of Greenwich; that latitude would diminish by three-tenths of
a second, which is a magnitude quite large enough to be recognizable
by the observations [ have already indicated as proper for the determ1-
nation of latitude. <A shift of the pole to a distance of 60 feet would be
a conspicuous alteration announced in every observatory in Europe pro-
vided with instruments of good modern construction.

Until the last few years there was not much reason to think that the
pole exhibited any unequivocal indications of movement. No doubt,
displacements resembling those which have now been definitely ascer-
tained have existed for many years, but they were too small to produce
any appreciable effect, except with instruments of a more refined de-
scription than those with which the earlier observatories were equipped.
It was obvious that the pole did not make movements of anything like
a hundred yards in extent; had it done so the resulting variations in
latitude would have been conspicuous enough to have obtained notice
many years ago. The actual movements which the pole does make are
of that small character which require very minute discussion of the
observations to establish them beyond reach of cavil. There is how-
ever one striking method of confirming such observations as have been
made which leaves no doubt of the accuracy of the results to which
they point. Suppose, for instance, that the great observatories in
Europe indicate at a certain time that their latitudes have all increased;
this necessarily implies that the equator has receded from them, and
that, therefore, the North Pole has approached Europe. If however
the North Pole has approached Europe it must have retreated from
those regions on the opposite side of the world—say, for instance, the
Sandwich Islands. Observations in the Sandwich Utslands should
therefore indicate, if our reasoning has been correct, that the pole has
retreated from them, and that the equator has therefore advanced in
such a way that the latitudes of localities in the Sandwich Islands have
diminished, The various observations which have been brought to-
gether by the diligence of Mr. Chandler, including those which he has
himself made with an ingenious apparatus of his own design, have been
submitted to this test, and they have borne it well. The result has
been that 1t 1s now possible to fodow the movements of the pole with a
considerable degree of completeness. Prof. Chandler has tracked the
pole month after month, year after year, through a period of more than
a century of exact observations, and he has succeeded in determining
86 THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE.

the movements which this point undergoes. Let me here endeavor to
describe the result at which he has arrived.

In that paleocrystic ocean which Arctic travellers have described,
where the masses of ice lie heaped together in the wildest confusion,
lies this point which is the object of so much speculation. Let us think
of this tract, or a portion of it, to be leveled to a plain, and at a par-
ticular center let a circle be drawn, the radius of which is about 30 feet;
it is in the circumference of this cirele that the pole of the earth is con-
stantly to be found. In fact, if at different times, month after month
and year after year, the position of the pole was ascertained as the
extremity of that tube from which an eye placed at the center of the
earth would be able to see the pole of the heavens, and if the succes-
sive positions of this pole were marked by pegs driven into the ground,
then the several positions in which the pole would be found must nec-
essarily trace out the circumference of the circle that has been thus
described. The period in which each revolution of the pole around the
circle takes place is about four hundred and twenty-seven days; the
result therefore of these investigations shows, when the observations
are accurate, that the North Pole of the earth is not, as has been so
long supposed, a fixed point, but that it revolves around in the earth,
accomplishing each revolution in about two months more than the
period that the earth requires for the performance of each revolution
around the sun.

The discovery of the movement of the pole which I have here
described must be regarded as a noteworthy achievement in astronomy,
nor is the result to which it leads solely of interest in consequence of
the lesson it teaches us with regard to the circumstances of the earth’s
rotation. It has a higher utility, which the practical astronomer will
not be slow to appreciate, and of which he has, indeed, already experi-
enced the benefit. There are several astronomical investigations in
which the latitude of the observatory enters as a significant element.
Latitude is, in fact, at every moment employed as an important factor
in many astronomical determinations. To take one of the most simple
cases, Suppose that we are finding the place of a planet in the observa-
tory. Wededuceits position by measuring its zenith distance, and then
to obtain the declination the latitude of the observatory has, of couwrsey
to be considered. Now astronomers have hitherto been in the habit of
accepting the determination of their latitude which had been estab-
lished by a protracted series of observations, and treating it as if it
were a constant. This method will be no longer admissible when astro-
nomical work of the highest class is demanded. No doubt, from the
sailor’s point of view, an alteration in latitude which at most amounts
to a shift of 60 feet—not a quarter, perhaps, of the length of his vessel—
is immaterial. But in the more refined parts of astronomical work
these discoveries can no longer be overlooked; indeed, Mr. Chandler
has shown that many discrepancies by which astronomers had been
THE WANDERINGS OF THE NORTH POLE. 87

baffied can be removed when note is taken of the circumstance that the
latitude of the observatory is in an incessant condition of transforma-
tion in accordance with the law which lis labors have expounded. It
will ere long be necessary in every observatory where important work
is being done to obtain for every day the correction to the mean value
of the latitude, in order to obtain the value appropriate for that day.

There are also other grounds of a somewhat profounder character
on which the discoveries now made are eminently instructive.
Those who are interested in the physies of our globe often discuss
the question as to whether the internal heat, which the earth certainly
possesses, iS sufficiently intense to render the deep-seated portions of
our globe more or less fluid. On the other hand, the effects of pres-
sure, especially of such pressures as are experienced in the depths
hundreds and thousands of miles below the surface, must go far to con.
solidate the materials to form what must be sensibly a rigid body.
The question, therefore, arises: Is the earth to be regarded as a rigid
mass, or is it not?) The phenomena of the tides had already to some
extent afforded information on this subject, and now Mr. Chandler’s
investigation adds much further light, for it is certain from his result
that the earth can not be a rigid body. It is quite true that, even
though the earth were rigid, the pole might go round in a cirele and
that circle might have a 30-feet radius, but in such a case the period
would be only about three-quarters of the four hundred and twenty-
seven days which he has found. In the interest, therefore, of the theo-
retical astronomer, as well as on the other grounds which [ have set
forth, Mr. Chandler’s investigations must be regarded as a most impor-
tant contribution to modern astronomy.
THE GREAT LUNAR CRATER TYCHO.*

By A. C. RANYARD.

The late Prebendary Webb used to speak of Tycho as the metropol-
itan crater of the moon. Though by no means the largest of the lunar
craters, it is one of the most striking teatures of the lunar landscape,
especially when the moon is near to the full, and the shadows of the
mountains have all disappeared. The crater of Tycho is then seen as
a conspicuously white spot, from which radiate in all directions a great
number of whitish rays that extend over more than a third of the visi-
ble hemisphere of the moon, indicating that the crater has been the
center of a colossal disturbance which seems to have shattered the
lunar crust in all directions. We have, as far as I am aware, no evi-
dence in the terrestrial geologic record that a corresponding cataclysm
has ever similarly shattered the earth’s crust; but our terrestrial vol-
canoes are puny things compared with the giant craters of our smaller
companion planet.

As inight be expected, the strange phenomena presented in so unpar-
alleled a degree by Tycho have been a fruitful stimulus to speculation
as to the origin of the lunar craters and the radiating systems of rays
with which many of the moon’s craters are evidently intimately con-
nected. Many able men have doubted whether there is any true
analogy between terrestrial volcanoes and the gigantic lunar ring
mountains and circular depressions which we ordinarily speak of as
craters. The ring of Tycho is 54 miles in diameter, and the great cra-
ter Clavius, which lies to the south of it, is more than 140 miles in
diameter; but Clavius is by no means the largest of the lunar craters.
If the lunar Apennines and the other mountains forming a broken
ring round the Mare Imbrium are the remnants of a crater, it must
have had a diameter of over 600 miles, while the largest terrestrial cra-
ters are not more than 15 or 16 miles in diameter.t Vesuvius and the

sophical Society of Washington, vol. x1, p. 247, (1) the old crater containing Lake

Monte Sumna would appear as insignificant little hills if they were
dropped into the center of the crater of Tycho, whose ring wall towers
to a height of 17,000 feet above the plain it incloses.

Robert Hooke compared the lunar craters to the cup-shaped pits
formed on the surface of boiling mud by escaping vapor, and the idea
has been a fascinating one to many minds since his day, though it needs
but ttle consideration to recognize that bubbles or blisters formed in
a plastic material on a seale corresponding with that of the lunar craters
would rapidly sink down and be obliterated.

Mr. 8. E. Peal has ingeniously advocated a theory which seems to
me almost equally untenable. He assumes that the lunar surface con-
sists entirely of ice, and that the craters and pit-like depressions are
due to the action of hot springs which have not flowed continuously,
but that water has from time to time issued from vents in the soil, and
has melted the ice above the vent. The water is then supposed to have
flowed back to the warm interior of the moon, taking with it a part of
the surface ice that has been melted, and by a series of such ebbs and
flows Mr. Peal conceives the terraced walls of the lunar craters to have
been built up above the level of surrounding plains. Putting on one
side the difficulty of conceiving of nearly perpendicular ice cliffs of
17,000 to 20,000 feet high, standing for ages without flowing down as
glaciers to the plains at their feet, we have to account for the fact that
the lunar plains and the floors of the deeper lunar craters are generally
of a much darker tint than the higher ground upon the moon, while if
the whole of the lunar surface were composed of ice and snow there
wouid be no reason for such a difference of tint, unless, as Mr. Peal
suggests, the lunar plains are surfaces of virgin ice while the moun-
tains are formed of snow. But virgin ice would reflect the light of the
sun specularly, and in the equatorial and tropical parts of the moon
from which the sun’s rays could be specularly reflected to us there are
no traces of such specular reflection. The theory also fails to account
for the small craters frequently found on the rims of large craters and
on the sloping sides of mountains. Such small craters are far above
the assumed rock surface of the moon, and warm water issuing from |
them would flow down the sides of the mountains leaving marked traces
of its flow. The meteoric theory of the formation of lunar craters has
also had many advocates. It is alleged that if a pebble be dropped
into mud the scar produced has a raised rim and a central hill, which
resembles a lunar crater. Even Mr. Proctor had an inclination for this
theory. At page 346 of his book on the moon he says: ‘So far as the
smaller craters are concerned, there is nothing incredible in the suppo-

sition that they were due to meteoric rain falling when the moon was
in a plastic condition. Indeed, it is somewhat remarkable how strik-
ingly certain parts of the moon resemble a surface which has been
rained upon, while sufficiently plastic to receive the impressions, but
not too soft to retain them. Nor is it any valid objection to this sup-
position, that the rings left by meteoric downfall would only be cireu-
lar when the falling matter chanced to strike the moon’s surface
squarely, for it is far more probable that even when the surface was
struck obliquely, and the opening first formed by the meteoric mass or
cloud of bodies was therefore markedly elliptic, the plastic surface
would close in round the place of impact until the impression actually
formed had assumed a nearly circular shape.” After inviting attention
to the lunar photographs published with his book, Mr. Proctor contin-
ues: “It will be seen that the multitudinous craters near the southern
part of the moon are strongly suggestive of the kind of process I have
referred to, and that, in fact, if one judged solely by appearances one
would be disposed to adopt somewhat confidently the theory that the
moon had had her present surface contour chiefly formed by meteoric
downfalls during the period of her existence when she was plastic to
impressions from without. I am however sensible that the great
craters, under close telescopic scrutiny, by no means correspond in
appearance to what we should expect if they were formed by the down-
fall of great masses from without. The regular, and we may almost
say battlemented, aspect of some of these craters, the level floor, and
the central peaks so commonly recognized, seem altogether different
from what we should expect if a mass fell from outer space upon the
moon’s surface. It is indeed just possible that under the tremendous
heat generated by the downfall, a vast circular region of the moon’s
surface would be rendered liquid, and that in rapidly solidifying while
still traversed by the ring waves resulting from the downfall, something
like the present condition would result.”

More recently the meteoric theory of the formation of lunar craters
has been taken up and considerably elaborated by an American, Mr.
G. K. Gilbert, who has made the theory the subject of an address deliv-
ered when retiring from the presidency of the Washington Philosophical
Society on December 10,1892. Recognizing the difficulty alluded to by
Mr. Proctor, viz, that most of the lunar craters are circular, while if the
meteoric bodies came from outer space many of them ought to strike
the moon’s surface very obliquely and produce elliptic rings, Mr. Gil-
bert made a series of experiments in the laboratory and found that
when projectiles were thrown obliquely against a target of plastic mate-
rials a crater-shaped hole of elliptic contour was formed. In order to
obviate this objection to the theory he assumes that the bombarding
masses which gave rise to the lunar craters did not come from outer
space, but were originally parts of a ring about the earth similar to the
ring which encircles the planet Saturn. From this ring he supposes
4 THE GREAT LUNAR CRATER TYCHO.

that the moon was gradually formed, the small bodies constituting the
ring having first coalesced into a large number of moonlets which finally
all united into a single sphere. According to this hypothesis the lunar
craters are the scars produced by the collision of the moonlets which
last surrendered their individuality, and according to Mr, Gilbert and
a mathematical friend who aided him in the investigation, 58 per cent
of the moonlets would, under the circumstances imagined, strike the
surface of the moon, making an angle of less than 20° with the vertical,
while 70 per cent would strike at an angle of less than 30°, and 80 per
cent at an angle of less than 40°. From laboratory experiments Mr.
Gilbert found that the ellipticity of the scars on his plastic target
increased slowly up to an incidence of 40° to the vertical, and that
beyond that-incidence the resulting scars showed consinerapie ellip-
ticity. He assumes that, owing to the flat character of the Saturnian
ring about the earth, the moonlets must have approached the moon
approximately in the plane of its equator, but the fact is not attested
by the grouping of the craters in a medial zone. Mr. Gilbert therefore
assumes that the axis of the moon’s rotation has shifted under the sue-
cessive impulses of the bombardment, and that the moon’s equator has
occupied successively all parts of its surface. He assumes that the
velocity of impact due to the moon’s gr avity would be sufficient to melt
the rocks of the lunar surface, and that they would during a short period
behave as if they were composed of plastic material, but would become
hardened, before the crater could subside.

The theory does not at all commend itself to my mind. M. Roche, of
Montpelier, showed that a ring about a planet would break up if it
extended beyond a distance of 2 11-25ths the radius from the center of
the planet, and if the density of the planet increased towards its center
the maximum limit to which a ring could extend would be still farther
contracted. A moon formed just outside such a ring would have an
ellipticity greater than that of an ordinary hen’s egg; and as tidal
action carried the moon away from its primary it would gradually
approximate to a spherical form. Onecan hardly conceive that such a .
change of shape could take place without obliterating scars on its sur-
face; but there is another objection to the theory, which, to my mind,
is even more conclusive. There are upon the moon many lines or
strings of small craterlets which fall very evidently into line with one
another. If we are forced to treat them as scars upon a target, we
must regard their allineation as the result of mere chance distribution ;
but the number of such strings precludes any such assumption; there
must therefore be a physical reason for the allineation, and the most
obvious assumption seems to be that the craterlets mark out a line of
weakness in the crust of the moon and lie along a volcanic fissure or
lunar fault.

There is ever gradation in size and in type from the small craterlets
or cup-shaped depressions up to the gigantic walled rings, and any
THE GREAT LUNAR CRATER TYCHO. 93

theory which professes to account for craterlets must account for the
types of crater into which they gradually merge. We therefore seem
driven back to the volcanic hypothesis, and have to explain why upon
the moon, which is so much smaller than the earth, the voleanic out-
breaks have been on so colossal a scale. Weare noteven in a position
to say that the moon is made of similar materials to the earth—indeed,
we know that its average density is considerably less, the earth being
about 5:66 times as heavy as a similar globe of water, while the moon
is only about 3°39 times as dense as water, or, according to Dr. Gill’s
recent determination, about 1 per cent less. We must not however
conclude from this difference that the moon is made of different mate-
rials from the earth, for we know too little as to the behavior of solids
under the enormous pressures that they must be subjected to at even
a few miles beneath the earth’s surface. The average density of the
rocks of which the earth’s surface is composed is only about two and
a half times that of water, but it does not follow that the central parts
of the earth are composed of different and heavier material. The great
rigidity of the earth under the tidal strains imposed upen it by the sun
and moon points to the conclusion that the solid materials of which the
earth is built up are rendered rigid by compression, and that the idea
of a fluid interior must be abandoned. Mr. George F. Becker, of the
U.S. Geological Survey, has recently pointed out that the slags, into
which most of the stratified rocks of the earth’s surface would be
reduced by melting, increase in bulk on fusion, and are not like iron
and water, which expand on solidifying; consequently, he argues that
any crust which formed on the surface of a molten sphere of slag would
speedily break up by its own weight and sink, and that the process
would go on until the whole mass had been reduced in temperature by
such upheavals to near the melting point of the slag. But if the liquid
slag, or other materials of which the earth is composed, were capable
of being reduced by the pressure of the superincumbent mass to the
solid condition, such upheavals would not take place, and under such
circumstances it is possible that the heat of the earth may go on increas-
ing to its center.

If below the surface of the earth large masses of highly heated rock
are kept solid by the enormous pressure of overlying rocks, earth move-
ments, caused by the cooling and contraction which erumple up the
stratified rocks of the surface and give rise to the upheaving of moun-
tain chains, may occasionally take off some of the weight from the
rocks beneath, causing the highly heated rocks to run off into the
liquid state again and find their way to the surface, causing the phe-
nomena we know as volceanie action.

If we adopt this theory of volcanic action, and assume that the moon
is made of similar materials to the earth, we shall—with lunar gravity
only equal to one-sixth of terrestrial gravity—need to pass to a depth
Six times as great upon the moon in order to obtain the pressure neces-
94 THE GREAT LUNAR CRATER TYCHO.

sary to solidify liquid lava at a temperature equivalent to that at which
it is solidified beneath the earth’s surface, and any change of pressure
that releases a stratum of rock from the solid to the liquid state weuld
upon the moon release a stratum approximately six times as thick,
other conditions being similar, and would presumably give rise to lava
flows on a gigantic scale compared with terrestrial evolutions. Added
to these considerations, we must remember that under the feeble action
of lunar gravity crater rings and cliffs may be built up of similar mate-
rial much more steeply upon the moon than at the earth’s surface.

There are many formations upon the moon which do not take the
form of crater rings. The Riphiean Mountains as shown in a photo-
graph taken by the Brothers Henry in May, 1890, is a very good
instance to cite. I should like to draw special attention to a curious
straight black streak between the crater’s Birt and Thebit. Itis spoken
of by Webb as a wall, but it rather seems to be a narrow valley or
fault. It is shown on several of the photographs taken by the Brothers
Henry. I would also draw the readev’s attention to three dark spots
on the floor of the crater Alphonsus, which are shown in all good pho-
tographs, as well as the curious marking, like a capital G, near to the
centre of the Mare Nubian.
THE EARLY TEMPLE AND PYRAMID BUILDERS,*

By J. NORMAN LOCKYER.

J have in previous articles discussed the orientation of many temples
in various parts of Egypt. It will have been seen that it has been pos-
sible to divide them into solar and stellar temples, and that in the case
of the foriner both solstices and equinoxes have been in question.

I have also referred to the very considerable literature which already
existsas to the pyramids, and shown how the most carefully constructed
among them are invariably oriented truly to the four cardinal points,
and further that it is possible that some parts of their structures might
have served some astronomical purpose, since astronomical methods
must certainly have been employed in their construction.

It has also been suggested that the fundamental difference between
solstitial and equinoctial worships, indicated by the solstitial temples
and the pyramids, required nothing less than a difference of race to
explain it. I propose now to inquire if there be any considerations
which can be utilized to continue the discussion of the question thus
raised on purely astronomical grounds. It is obvious that, if sufficient
tradition exists to permit us to associate the various structures which
have been studied astronomically with definite periods of Egyptian
history, a study of the larger outlines of that history will enable us to
determine whether or not the critical changes in dynasties and rulers
were or were not associated with critical changes in astronomical ideas
as revealed by changes in temple worship. If there be no connection,
the changes may have been due to a change of idea only, and the sug-
gestion of a distinction of race falls to the ground.

In a region of inquiry where the facts are so few and difficult to recog-
nize among a mass of myths and traditions, to say nothing of contra-
dictory assertions by different authors, the more closely we adhere to
a rigidly scientific method of inquiry the better. I propose to show
therefore that there is one working hypothesis which seems to include
a great many of the facts, and [hope to give the hypothesis and the facts
in such a way that if there be anything inaccurately or incompletely

*From Nature. May 18, 1893; vol, XLVI, pp. 55-58,

96 THE EARLY, TEMPLE AND PYRAMID BUILDERS.

stated it will be easy at once to change the front of the inquiry and
proceed along the new line indicated.

I may begin by remarking that it is fundamental for the hypothesis
that the temples of On or Heliopolis, as stated by Maspero and ether
high authorities, existed before the times of Mini (Menes) and the
pyramid-builders, whatever may have been the date of the original
foundation of Thebes.

Before Mini, according to Maspero, ‘On et les villes du Nord avaient
eu la part principale dans le développement de la civilisation Egyp-
tienne. Les prieres et les hymnes, qui formeérent plus tard le noyau des
livres sacrés, avaient été rédigés sa On.” *

The working hypothesis is as follows:

(1) The first civilization as yet glimpsed in Egypt, represented by
On or Heliopolis, was a civilization with a solstitial solar worship asso-
ciated with the rise of the Nile. A northern star was also worshiped.

(2) Memphis (possibly also Sais, Bubastis, Tanis, and other cities
with east and west walls) and the pyramids were built by aninvading
race from a land where the worship was equinoctial. A star rising in
the east was worshiped at the equinox.

(3) The blank in Egyptian history between the sixth and eleventh
dynasties was associated with conflicts between these races, which were
ended by the victory of the representatives of the old worship of On.
After them pyramid building ceased and solstitial worship was resus-
citated; Memphis takes second place, and Thebes, a southern On, so
far as solstitial solar worship is concerned, comes upon the seene as the
seat of the twelfth dynasty.

(4) The subsequent historical events were largely due to conflicts
with intruding races. The intruders established themselves in cities
with east and west walls, and were on each occasion driven out by sol-
stitial solar worshipers, who founded dynasties (eighteenth and twenty-
fifth) at Thebes.

I.—On,

I have taken another occasion of remarking how the various worships
at Thebes were reflected in the orientation of the temenos walls. The
so-called “‘symmetrophobia” of the Egyptians was full of meaning,
which in this case, at all events, is no longer hidden. If we note this
reflection, as we can over and over again, where both temples and walls
still stand, it is fair to assume that where the walis alone remain the
temples which they once inclosed, long since destroyed, had the same
relation. These considerations, alas, have to be appealed to in the case
of Heliopolis, to say so far nothing of Abydos and Memphis.

At Heliopolis the so-called ‘“symmetrophobia,” as indicated by the
trend of the mounds given in Lepsius’s plan, is so strong that, in spite
of the fact that only one obelisk of one temple remains, it is easy to

* « Histoire ancienne,” p. 41.
THE EARLY TEMPLE AND PYRAMID BUILDERS. oT

show that both solstitial solar worship and star worship were carried
on, if walls had the same relation to the included temples at On as they
had at Thebes.

The solar temple at On has entirely disappeared. As may be gath-
ered from the remains of the mounds, it lay in the line of the solstices.
As the gods included Ra, Atmu, and Osiris, probably like the temple
of Amen Ra at Thebes, there were two temples back to back. At
Thebes the temples were directed northwest to southeast, at On south-
west to northeast.

My observations of: the orientation of the obelisk show that the tem-
ple of which it formed a part may have possibly been the first of the
series which includes the temple of Mut at Thebes, and other temples
there and at Abydos; that is the worship of Set was in question, to
speak generically. Now, according to Maspero,* Sit or Set formed one
of the divine dynasties, being associated with the sun and air gods at
On, i. e., with Ra, Atmu, Osiris, Horus, and Shou.

At Abydos, as also can be determined by the orientation of the walls,
one of the oldest temples was probably a solstitiai one. The stellar
temples, sacred to Set, were built much later than the solar temple.

Like On, Abydos was a sacred city.t “C’est comme ville sainte
qwelle était universellement connue. Ses sanctuaires etaient célebres,
son dieu Osiris vénéré, ses fétes suivies par toute ’Egypte; les gens
riches des autres nomes tenaient a honneur de se faire dresser une stéle
dans son temple.” ¢

If it be found that the references to ‘‘ancestors” and “divine ances-
tors” occur after the eleventh dynasty, the race represented by On may
be referred to and it may be that so often referred to as the Hor-shesu.

Only one star temple, as [ have said, is still represented at On; those
at Abydos are known to be late. The term, then, of Sun-worshippers
was highly distinctive, and there is reason to believe that the stellar
observations were connected with the solar worship.

I1.—(a@) THE EAST AND WEST WALLS AND PYRAMID BUILDERS.

On the hypothesis these came from a country where the worship was
equinoctial.

We are justified from what is known regarding the rise of the Nile
as dominating and defining the commencement of the Egyptian year
that other ancient peoples placed under like conditions would act in
the same way.

Now what the Nile was to Egypt the valleys of the Tigris and the
Euphrates were to the early Chaldean empire. Like the Nile, these

tIt is important to inquire if this took place after the advent of the eleventh
dynasty.

Sie95———=4
98 THE EARLY TEMPLE AND PYRAMID BUILDERS.

valleys were subject to annual inundations, and their fertility depended,
as in Egypt, upon the manner in which the irrigation was looked
after. But unlike the Nile, the commencement of the inundation of these
rivers took place near the vernal equinox; hence the year, we may
assume, began then, and, reasoning by analogy, the worship in ail prob-
ability was equinoctial.

A people entering Egypt from this region, then, would satisfy one
condition of the problem, but is there any evidence that this people
built their solar temples and temple walls east and west, and that they
also built pyramids?

There is ample evidence, although, alas, the structures in Chaidia,
being generally built in brick and not in stone, no longer remain, as do
those erected in Egypt. Still, in spite of the absence of the possibility
of a comparative study, research has shown that in the whole region
to the northeast of Egypt the temenos walls of temples and the walls
of towns run east and west; and, though at present actual dates can
not be given, a high antiquity is suggested in the case of someof them.
Further, the temples which remain in that region where stone was pro-
curable, as at Palmyra, Baalbec, Jerusalem, all lie east and west. But
more than this, it is well known that from the very earliest times pyram-
idal structures, called ziggurats, some 150 feet high, were erected in
ach important city. These were really observatories; they were pyra-
mids built in steps, as clearly shown from pictures found on contem-
porary tablets; and one with seven steps and of great antiquity, it is
known, was restored by Nebuchadnezzar, about 600 B. C., at Babylon.

A second condition of the hypothesis is therefore satisfied.

But did this equinox-worshiping, pyramid-building race Jive at any-
thing like the time required? Prof. Sayce showed in the Hibbert
lectures, which were delivered in the year 1887, that recent finds have
established the existence of a King Sargon I, at Agade in Chaldea,
3800 B. Cc. Hence it seems that a third condition of the hypothesis is
satisfied by this recent discovery. There was undoubtedly an equinox-
worshiping pyramid-building race existing in Chaldea at the time the
Egyptian pyramids are supposed to have been built.

Hommel, in a recent paper on the Babylonian origin of Egyptian
culture, shows that the names of the gods corresponded in many cases
with the names of deities mentioned in the oldest Egyptian pyramid

texts. - - - The names were represented by exactly the same signs
in both Babylonian and Egyptian hieroglyphies, - - - the name

and signs of Osiris the Babylonian Asari are represented in both coun-
tries by an eye. He contends that there had been a direct communi-
sation between the two civilizations, and that the Babylonian was the
older of the two.

Next let us return to Egypt. We find at Memphis, Sais, Bubastis,
and Tanis east and west walls, which at once stamp those cities as
differing in origin from On, Abydos, and Thebes, where, as I have
THE EARLY TEMPLE AND PYRAMID BUILDERS. 99

shown, the walls trend either northwest to southeast or northeast to
southwest.

For Memphis, Sais, and Tanis, the evidence is afforded by the maps
of Lepsius. For Bubastis it depends upon the statement of Naville,
that the walls run ‘‘ nearly from east to west,” and with the looseness
too often associated with such statements, it is not said whether true
or magnetic bearings are indicated.

Associated with these east and west walls there is further evidence
of great antiquity. Bubastis, according to Naville,* has afforded traces
of the date of Cheops and Chephren, and it is stated by Manetho to
have existed as early as the second dynasty.

It is also generally known that the pyramids in Egypt are oriented
east and west. Nor is this all. One of the oldest, if not the oldest,
pyramid known, is a step pyramid modelled on the ziggurat pattern,
the so-called ‘‘step pyramid of Sakkarah.” The steps are six in num-
ber, and vary in height from 38 to 29 feet, their width being about 6
feet. The dimensions are 352 (north and south) x 396 (east and west)
x 197 feet. Some authorities think this pyramid was erected in the
first dynasty by the fourth king (Nenephes of Manetho, Ata of the
tablet of Abydos). The arrangement of chambers in this pyramid 1s
quite special.

The claim to the highest antiquity of the step pyramid is disputed
by some in favor of the ‘“ false pyramid of Médtm. It also is really a
step pyramid 115 feet high, its outline, which conceals some of the steps,
shows three stages, 70, 20, and 25 feet high, but in its internal strue-
ture it is really a step pyramid of six stages.

This pyramid must, according to Petrie, be attributed to Seneferu;
but De Rouge has given evidence to the contrary.t Seneferu was a
king of the fourth dynasty.

We have at Dashour the only remaining abnormal pyramid, called
the blunted pyramid, for the reason that the inclination changes at
about one-third of the height. This pyramid forms one of a group of
four, two of stone, and, be it carefully borne in mind, two of brick; their
dimensions are 700 x 700 x 326 feet; 620 x 620 x 321 feet: 350 x 350 x 90
feet, and 345 x 343 x 156 feet.

One of these pyramids was formerly supposed to have been built by
Seneferu. If any of them had been erected by King Ousertsen III of
the twelfth dynasty, as was formerly thought, the hypothesis we are
considering would have been invalid.

Only after Seneferu then do we come to the normal Egyptian pyra-
mid, the two largest at Gizeh, built by Cheops and Chephren (fourth
dynasty), being, so far as is accurately known, the oldest of the series.
(According to Mariette, the date of Mini is 5004 B.c¢., and the fourth
dynasty commeneed in 4255 B. ¢.)

100 THE EARLY TEMPLE AND PYRAMID BUILDERS.

Associated with the cities with east and west walls are temples facing
due east; fit therefore to receive the rays of the morning sun rising
at an equinox.

Associated with these pyramids, carefully oriented east and west, we
find on their eastern sides some distance away and on a line passing
through their centers at right angles to a meridian line, temples facing
due west, the clearest possible indication of equinoctial worship. At
sunset at the equinox the sepulchral chamber and the sun were in a
line from the adytum. The priest faced a double Osiris.

In the case of the pyramid of Chephren, not only have we (as L hold)
such a temple of Osiris, but the Sphinx granite temple was most prob-
ably the erypt of a temple of Isis, its relation to the south face of the
pyramid being borne in mind. If this were so, Osiris was a name both
for the solstitial and equinoctial sun.

Other pyramids were built at Sakkarah during the sixth dynasty,
but it is remarkable that such a king as Pepi-Meri-Ra should not have
unitated the majestic structures of the fourth dynasty. He is said to
have built a pyramid at Sakkarah, but its obscurity is evidence that
the pyramid idea was giving way, and it looks as if this dynasty were
really on the side of On,* for the authority of Memphis declined and
Abydos was preferred, while abroad Sinai was re-conquered and Kthi-
opia was kept in order.t

The sphinx (oriented true east) must also be ascribed to the earliest
pyramid builders; it could not have been built before their intrusion.
The Colossi of the plain at Thebes was a subsequent reply of the On
solstitial worship to it.

(b) THE WORSHIP OF THE BULL BY THE PYRAMID BUILDERS.

There is a subsidiary point in connection with the pyramid builders
and equinoctial worship.

The worship oi Apis preceded the building of pyramids. Mini is
credited by Elian with its introduction,¢ but at any rate Kakau of the
second dynasty issued proclamations regarding it,§ and a statue of
Hapi was in the temphe of Cheops.

It is stated that the first month of the Chaldean year was dedicated
to the ‘‘ propitious bull,” and that the figure of a bull constantly oceurs
on the monuments as opening the year. Now the sun at the vernal
equinox 4500 B. C. was in the constellation Taurus. Biot has shown
that the equinox occurred with the sun near the pleiades in 3285 B. ¢.

the eleventh dynasty of Thebes. Maspero, op. cit., p. 91.

|| Maspero, op. cit., p. 64.
THE EARLY TEMPLE AND PYRAMID BUILDERS. 101

We seem driven to the conclusion that the constellation of the bull
dates from this time, and that Hapi represented it.*

(c) THE ART OF THE PYRAMID BUILDERS.

Another connecting link is found in the diorite statues found in the
temple of Chephren, at the pyramids, and at Tell-loh (ancient Sirgulla)
by M. de Sarzee in 1881. This last find consisted of some large statues
of diorite, and the attitude chosen was that of Chephren himself as rep-
resented in the Museum of Gizeh. This indicates equality in the arts
and the possession of similar tools in Chaldiea and Egypt about the
time in question.

(d) THE STAR WORSHIP OF THE PYRAMID BUILDERS.

I have given before the gods of Heliopolis, and have shown that with
the exception of Sit none are stellar, and that the temple of Sit is still
represented. But we find in pyramid times the list is vastly changed;
only the sun gods, Ra, Horus, Osiris, are common to the two. As new
divinities we find:t

Isis, Nephthys, Serk-t,
Hathor, Ptah, Sokhit.

Of these the first two and the last two undoubtedly symbolized stars,
and there can be no question that the temple of Isis at the pyramids
was built to watch the rising of some of them.t Of Isis and Hathor I
have already written at length, and J think the stars are now known.
The others are more doubtful, but it may be that Ptah = Capella and
Serk-t = Antares.

But it is also stated .that at Memphis§ [time not given] there were
temples dedicated to Soutekh and Baal. Now this is of great impor-
tance, for I suppose there is now no question among Egyptologists that
the gods Set, Sit, Typhon, Bes, Soutekh, Soutkhou are identical. It is
also equally well known that Soutekh was a god of the Canaanites;||
that the hippopotamus, the emblem of Set and Typhon, was the hiero-
glyph of the Babylonian god Baal, {{ and Bes is identified with Set in
the book of the dead.**

Antares. If so, the scorpion constellation had also been established and both
equinoxes marked by constellations in the time of Cheops.

+t Maspero, op. cit., p. 64.

{The temple of Sais, as I have said, had east and west walls, and so had Mem-
phis, according to Lepsius. The form of Isis at Sais was the goddess Neith, which,
according to some authorities, was the precursor of Athene. The tempie of Athene
at Athens was oriented to the pleiades.

102 THE EARLY TEMPLE AND PYRAMID BUILDERS

Jensen, in his Kosmologie der Babylonier, p. 16, points out that Bil
was the name for the pole of the equator. If this be the Baal referred
to by Pierret, we get the most marvellous coincidence between the
Egyptian and Babylonian star worship and suggestion of a common
origin among an astronomically minded people.

This suggests that the founders of On and Memphis had a common
origin, and the Memphitic intrusion took place after solar solstitial
worship had been introduced at On. This worship could not have
been brought into Egypt from any other country bordering on Chal-
dea, and its ultimate predominance is the origin of the myth of Horus
slaying the hippopotamus. Nay, it may be also suggested that the
predominance was brought about by men and ideas reaching On from
the south, so that the myth had a single celestial and a double terres-
trial side.

The Hawk God of Edft,, Harhouditi, had for servants a number of
individuals called Masniou or Masnitiou=blacksmiths, just as the
Hawk God of the Delta, Harsiisit, has for his entourage the Shosou
Horou. Maspero,in a most interesting paper,* has recently called atten-
tion to some customs still extant among the castes of blacksmiths in
Central Africa which have suggested to him that the followers of the
Edttii Horus may have come from that province.

He writes: “ C’est du sud de PEgypte que les forgerons sont remontés
vers ie nord; leur siége primitif était le sud de ’Egypte, la partie du
pays qui a le plus des rapports avec les régions centrales de |’Afrique
et leurs habitants.”

Then, after stating the present conditions of these workers in equato-
rial Africa, where they enjoy a high distinction, he concludes:

Ill.—THE WORK OF THE ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH DYNASTIES.

We have next to consider what happened after the great gap in
Egyptian history between the sixth and twelfth dynasties, 3500 B. c.-
2851 B. Cc. (Mariette), from Nitocris to Amenemhat I. We pass to the
Middle Empire.

Amenemhat I built no pyramids, he added no embellishments to
Memphis, but he took Heliopolis under his care, and now we first hear
of Thebes.t

Usertesen I built no pyramids, he added no embellishinents to Mem-
phis, but he also took Heliopolis under his care and added obelisks to
the temples, one of which remains to this day. Further, he restored
the temple of Osiris at Abydos and added to the temple of Amen-Ra
at Thebes. t

Surely it is very noteworthy that the first thing the kings of the
twelfth dynasty did was to look after the only three temples in Egypt
of which traces exist, which I have shown to have been oriented to
the solstice. It is right however to remark that there seems to have
been a mild recrudescence of pyramid building toward the end of the
twelfth dynasty, and immediately preceding the Hyksos period, whether
as a precurser of that period or not.

Usertesen’s views about his last home have come down to us in a

metal, more especially in iron. There is no doubt that in certain myths there 1s a
connection between the person of Horus and iron. Horus represented the sky, the
firmament; in antiquity the sky was thought to be a roof of iron, so much so that
the Egyptians called iron the sky metal. Horus usually carried an iron pointed
pike or javelin, as do the allied gods Anhouri and Shou, while the gods of the north
of Egypt, Ra, Phtah, ete., are unarmed. Is not the legend of Horhouditi conquering
Egypt with the help of the masniou (blacksmiths), an echo of an event which occurred
in the prehistoric period of Egypt. Comparable to the arrival of the Spaniards in
North America, was the invasion into Egypt of tribes knowing and using iron, having
among them a special caste of smiths, who brought with them the cult of a warlike
god, who they either called Horus or identified with the Horus of the early Egyptian
afterwards named Horhouditi. These tribes were of course of African origin, and
they brought new African elements to those already contained in the civilization of
the lower Nile. The smiths by and by lost their ancient privileges as they were
gradually merged in the rest of the population; only at Edfou and in the towns which
practiced the cult of the Horus of Edfou did they preserve a sacred character, being
transformed into a kind of domestic religious class, i, e., the masniou of the myth of
Horus, companions and servants of the warlike god.

writing by his scribe Miri:* ‘ Mon maitre m’envoya en mission pour
lui préparer une grande demeure éternelle. Les couloirs et la chambre
intérieure étaient en macgonnerie et renouvelaient les merveilles de
construction des dieux. I] y eut en elle des colonnes, sculptées, belles
comme le ciel, un bassin creusé qui communiquait avec le Nil, des
portes, des obélisques, une fagade en pierre de Rouou.”

There was nothing pyramidal about this idea, but one hundred and
fifty years later we find Amenemhat II] returning both to the gigantic
irrigation works and the pyramid building of the earlier dynasties.

The scene of these labors was the Fayytim, where, to crown the
new work, two ornamental pyramids were built, surmounted by statues,
and finally the king himself was buried in a pyramid near the Laby-
rinth.

IV.—THE WORK OF THE EIGHTEENTH DYNASTY.

The blank in Egyptian history between the twelfth and eighteenth
dynasties is known to have been associated with the intrusion of the
so-called Hyksos. It 1s supposed these made their way into Egypt
from the countries in and to the west of Mesopotamia. It is known
that they settled in the cities with east and west walls. They were
finally driven out by Aahmes, the king of solstitial solar Thebes, who
began the eighteenth dynasty.

In (a) I have shown what happened after the first great break in
Egyptian history—a resuscitation of the solstitial worship at On, Aby-
dos, and Thebes.

I have next to show that precisely the same thing happened after
the Hyksos period (Dyn. 13 (?). Mariette, 2233 Brugsch; Dyn. 18, 1703
B. C., Marietta) had disturbed history for some five hundred years.

It is known from the papyrus Sellier (G. C. 257) that Aahmes, the
first king of the eighteenth dynasty, who re-established the independ-
ence of Egypt, was in reality fighting the priests of Soutekh in favor
of the priests of Amen-Ra, the selstitial solar god, a modern represent-
ative of Atmu of On.

Amen-Ra, was the successor of Menthu, the successor of Atmu of On.
So close was the new worship to the oldest at On, that at the highest
point of Theban power the third priest of Amen took the same titles as
the Grand Priest of On, “ who was the head of the first priesthood in
Kgyvt.”t The‘Grand Priest of On,” who was also called the “ Great
Observer of Ra and Atmu,” had the privilege of entering at all times
into the Habenben or Naos. The priest Padouamen, whose mummy
was found in 1891, bore these among his other titles.

The assumption of the title was not only to associate the Theban
priesthood with their northern confréres, but surely to proclaim that
the old On worship was completely restored.

V.— THE WORK OF THE TWENTY-FIFTH DYNASTY.

There was another invasion from Syria, which founded the twenty-
second dynasty, and again the government is carried on in cities with
east and west walls (Sais, Tanis, and Bubastis). The solstitial solar
priests of Thebes withdraw to Ethiopia. They return, however, in 700
B. C., drive out the Syrian invaders, and, under Shabaka and Taharga,
found a dynasty (the twenty-fifth) at Thebes, and embellish the solsti-
tial solar temples there.

VI.—ANTHROPOLOGICAL EVIDENCE.

It will be seen then that a general survey of Egyptian history does
suggest conflict between two races, and this, of course, goes to
strengthen the view that the temple building phenomena suggest two
different worships, depending upon race distinctions.

We have next to ask if there is any anthropological evidence at our
disposal. It so happens that Virchow has directed his attention to
this very point.*

Premising that a strong race distinction is recognized between peo-
ples having brachycephalic or short, and dolichocephalic or long, skulls,
and that the African races belong to the latter group, I may give the
following extract from his paper:

“The craniological type in the ancient empire was different from that
in the middle and new. The skulls from the ancient empire are brachy-
cephalic, those from the new and of the present day are either dolcho-
cephalic or mesaticephalic; the difference is therefore at least as
great as that between the dolichocephale skulls of the Frankish graves
and the predominantly brachycephalic skulls of the present population
of South Germany. I do not deny that we have hitherto had at our
disposal only a very limited number of skulls from the ancient empire
which have been certainly determined; that therefore the question
whether the brachycephalic skull-type deduced from these was the
general or at least the predominant one can not yet be answered with
certainty, but I may appeal to the fact that the sculptors of the ancient
empire made the brachycephalic type the basis of their works of art,
too.”

It will be seen then that the anthropological as well as the histor-
ical evidence “runs on all fours” with the results to be obtained from
such a study of the old astronomy as the temples afford us.

VARIABLE STARS.*

By Prof. C. A. YOUNG.

For the most part the stars maintain their places and brightness
apparently unchanged; the heavens of to-day are substantially the
same as those of Job and Homer. The comparison of a modern star
catalogue with that of Hipparchus as preserved by Ptolemy shows that
with few and generally slight exceptions the principal stars still hold
the same relative positions and the same rank in brightness which they
did two thousand years ago. And yet we know that all the time they
have been swiftly moving in all directions at rates sometimes exceed-
ing 100 miles a second—some approaching us and some receding.
Then, too, they have all been growing old together, some advancing
from stellar infancy toward adult vigor, and some descending toward
extinction. The apparent permanence is apparent only,—due simply to
the fact that the scale of human life and all our terrestrial surround-
ings is practically infinitesimal as compared with that of the stellar
universe. Even the nearest star is soremote that if it were rushing
directly toward us with the speed of 100 miles a second it would gain
in brightness only about 24 per cent in a century, an amount barely
observable by our best photometers. As to changes due merely to
advancing age, a century bears only some such ratio to the lifetime of
a star as a single minute to that of an aged man.

But while all this is true there are several hundred stars which are
known as “variables,” and undergo considerable changes of bright-
ness, sometimes quite rapidly. They form the subject of a most inter-
esting and important chapter in astronomy,—a chapter which may be
regarded as opened by Tycho’s observations of the marvellous star of
1572, but even yet only begun; in fact, nearly all the systematic work
that has been done in this line has been accomplished within the last
sixty years.

These “variables” may be roughly classified as follows: First, we
have a few stars that seem to be gradually, and more or less steadily,
growing brighter or fainter, judging from their present rank as com-
pared with that which they used to hold; Alpha Geminorum is a case

108 VARIABLE STARS.

in point, being now distinctly fainter than its neighbor, Beta, although
presumably when Bayer assigned the letters, about three hundred
years ago, the reverse was the case. A second class consists of those
which oscillate in brightness, but without any apparent regularity,
like Eta Argus, and Alpha Orionis. The third class is made up of the
so-called ‘temporary stars,” stars which suddenly shine out and after
a few months disappear or become very faint. There have been about
a dozen instances of this kind, the last being the “new star in Auriga,”
which appeared in 1892. The fourth class, and by far the most numer-
ous, is made up of those which vary periodically in brightness in a
manner which admits of mathematical prediction. Among these
periodic stars, at least three sub-classes are to be distinguished: (a)
Those which at regular intervals brighten up for a comparatively short
time and then fall back to their normal condition until the next maxi-
mum. These are often referred to as the ‘“ Omicron Ceti type,”
because that star usually called Mira, or the “ wonderful,” is the most
conspicuous and longest known of all that belong to it. The majority
of the periodic stars belong to this sub-class, and generally repeat
their changes about once a year, though their periods range all the

yay from one hundred and ten days to six hundred and ten. (b) The
second sub-class includes the stars which, like Beta Lyra, are in a
continual state of activity; they often present more than one maxi-
mum of brightness within a single complete period, which is usually
somewhere between five days and sixty. (c) Finally, we have the ten
stars of the so-called ‘Algol type,” which behave in a manner pre-
cisely the opposite of that of the stars of the first sub-class, 7. e., they
undergo periodical diminutions or eclipses of their light, remaining
for the remainder of the time steadily bright. Their periods are
always short, ranging from seven howrs to ten days. The type of the
class is Beta Persei, better known as Algol.

The variations of the stars of this class can be very simply explained
as merely due to actual eclipses, and the truth of this explanation has
been practically established within the last three years by the spectro-
scopic work of Vogel, at Potsdam. The period of Algolis a trifle under
sixty-nine hours, and the photographs show that seventeen hours before
the obscuration the lines of its spectrum are displaced toward the red
by an amount which indicates that itis then receding from us at the
rate of about 27 miles a second, while seventeen hours after the obscu-
ration it is found to be approaching at the same rate; in short, the
observations prove that the star is moving in an orbit nearly cireular,
a little more than 2,000,000 miles in diameter, and lying in a plane
nearly passing through the observer. Now if the periodical obscura-
tion is really caused by the interposition of an eclipsing body, the
bright star must necessarily circulate around the common center of
gravity between itself and its dusky attendant in just this sort of way,
and the detection of such motion falls little short of a demonstration of
VARIABLE STARS. 109

the hypothesis. We may go further; taking into account the fact that
the whole “eclipse” lasts for about eight hours, and that the star loses
about two-thirds of its light at the time of maximum obscuration (when
the brightness remains without change for about twenty minutes), it
ean be safely inferred that the dark attendant is just about four-fifths
the diameter of the bright star and about half as heavy. Also that
the distance between the two is about 5,250,000 miles, the diameters of
the two bodies being respectively about 1,060,000 and 840,000 miles.
Moreover, the combined mass of the two is about two-thirds that of the
sun, and their density only one-fifth as great, not much exceeding that
of cork.

Nor is this all; since the discovery of the variability of the star in
1782, a slight but distinct variation of the period has been observed, of
such a character as to set the times of eclipse alternately backward and
forward by about two hours and a half in the interval between 1804 and
1869. From this, combined with certain minute irregularities in the
“proper motion” of the star, Mr. Chandler two years ago showed that
Algol and its companion must be moving together in a great orbit,
nearly as large as that of the planet Uranus, completing the revolution
in a period of about one hundred and thirty years; at least, such a revo-
lution would account for the facts, while no other hypothesis yet proposed
will do so. Andif this revolution is real, it must be around some neigh-
boring body, so faintly luminous that it has not yet been detected. The
story of Algol opens up tous a new universe of “dark stars”—bodies
invisible, but massive and powerful. Presumably the other stars of the
Algolelass admit of a similar explanation, although as yet they have not
been spectroscopically studied, being all of them small and too faint for
investigation with the instruments at present available. When the great
Yerkes telescope, now nearing completion, is mounted at Lake Geneva 1t
is expected that one of its earliest applications will be to investigations
of this sort. It should be added also that certain peculiarities in the
light curves of some of these stars seem to indicate that we have not
quite reached the bottom of the matter; that in addition to the eclipse,
and perhaps caused by it, there are real variations in the light-giving
power of the star.

As to the other classes of variables, there is no such satisfactory
explanation nor any generally received theory. In the case of Beta
Tyre and its congeners, we have apparently mechanical and other
causes combined—the axial revolution of a star, perhaps, or possibly
the whirling of a group of stars, accompanied by tidal changes in the
brightness and spectroscopic characteristics of their lght, for while
the minima of the Algol variables are not accompanied by any altera-
tion of the character of the lines in their spectra, it is not so with the
other variables; their spectra are almost all of them characterized by
bright lines, which become especially brilliant at the time of maximum .
brightness. Beta Lyre presents conspicuously in its spectrum both
110 VARIABLE STARS.

bright and dark lines, due to hydrogen; and these shift back and forth
with reference to each other in such a way as apparently to indicate
the presence of two or more bodies whirling around each other, one of
them giving the ordinary dark-line spectrum and the other the bright-
line spectrum of the gas.

The stars of the first and much the most numerous sub-class are
nearly all distinctly red and show in their spectra the bright lines of
hydrogen, but do not as yet furnish any certain evidence that their
periodicity is of a mechanical origin-due; that is, to a revolution of
some sort. Possibly the explanation proposed by Lockyer may ulti-
mately be verified—that the sudden evolution of light is due to the
collision between two swarms of meteors which revolve around their
common center of gravity, and brush against each other as they pass
their perihelion point. But the periodicity of this class of variables is
hardly regular enough to suit this explanation, and the sudden out-
burst of the bright lines in the spectrum of a star suggests rather some
such action, though on a vastly grander scale, as that which causes the
sun spots and the solar prominences,—causes operating within the star
itself.

As to the “temporary stars” opinion is much divided. On the one
hand Lockyer and his numerous followers attribute the phenomena to
the collision of swarms of meteors, while on the other Huggins and
Vogel are disposed to assimilate them to the solar eruptions. The
latest instance of the kind, the ‘“ Nova Aurigwe” already alluded to,
which appeared in February, 1892, has been most exhaustively studied
by a great number of observers. It is agreed on all hands that at
first its spectrum was full of bright lines, and dark lines also; and that
among these lines those of hydrogen, both bright and dark, were spec-
ially conspicuous, just as in the spectrum of Beta Lyrw; and more-
over, that the bright lines were so shifted towards the red end of the
spectrum with respect to the dark lines as to indicate the tremendous
relative velocity of more than 500 miles a second in the two masses to
which the lines were respectively due. As to the other lines there was
dispute. Lockyer maintained that they were the same that are found
in the nebule; other observers, no doubt correctly, identified them
with certain lines which are conspicuous in the spectrum of the solar
chromosphere in every important eruption. The star faded to apparent
extinction in April, 1892, but most unexpectedly brightened up again
the folowing August, though not so as to be seen with the naked eye;
with the telescope it is still visible. Its spectrum, however, has under-
gone a remarkable transformation, many of the lines which were
formerly most conspicuous having disappeared, while others have taken
their place, so that at present it is unquestionably a nebular spectrum.
As Mr. Campbell, of the Lick Observatory, who has perhaps the best

right to speak authoritatively, puts it, ‘“‘The lines of the present
“spectrum do not occupy the positions of the lines in the February

5
VARIABLE STARS. 111

spectrum, nor the positions of the lines in the solar chromosphere, nor
the positions of the lines in the spectra of any of the bright-lines stars;
they do occupy the positions of the lines in the nebulee, and the spec-
trum. resembles nebule spectra as closely as well-known nebulee
spectra resemble each other.” This is said in answer to some high
authorities who find it difficult to admit so surprising a fact as such a
transformation. It certainly looks as if we had to do with a reversion
ot the ordinary course of stellar development; instead of the forma-
tion of astar by the slow condensation of a nebula, we seem to have
the sudden formation of a nebula by the violent explosion of a star.
But speculation on so small a basis of fact is hardly sound.

I must not close without a reference to the important, though unpre-
tending, catalogue of variable stars just published by Mr. Chandler,
of Cambridge, who, since the death of Schonfeld, may be regarded as
at the head of the department of variable stars, so far at least as relates
to the mathematical aspects of the subject. The first step to any real
mastery of it must be an accurate collection of facts, such as this cata-
logue embodies. It gives a list of all the stars which are certainly
known at present to be variable, 260 in number (62 of them naked-eye
stars), and adds a subsidiary ist of 100 more which are more or less
strongly suspected. Of the 260, about 35 are known to be irregular
and unpredictable in their variations, and about as many more are
still in doubt as regards the periodicity of their changes. The remain-
ing 190 are clearly periodic, and Mr. Chandler gives for each of them
the formula by means of which its variations can be predicted, thus
embodying in a few modest figures the result of an enormous amount
of skillful labor, Ten of the variables belong to the Algol class, about
25 to that of Beta Lyra, and the rest resemble Omicron Ceti more or
less perfectly. It should be added also that the list of variables is
constantly growing—chiefly, of course, among the telescopic stars.
THE LUMINIFEROUS AUTHER. *

By Sir GEORGE G. STOKES.

I intend to bring before you to-night a subject which the study of
light has caused me to think a good deal about: I refer to the nature
and properties of the so-called luminiferous zether. This subject is, mn
one respect, specially fascinating, scientifically considered. It lies, we
may Say, in an especial manner on the borderland between what is
known and what is unknown. In the study of it, it 1s quite conceivable
that great discoveries may be made, and in fact great discoveries
have already been made, and I may say even quite recently, and we
do not at present know how much additional light on the system of
Nature may be in store for the men of science; possibly even in the
near future, possibly not until many generations have passed away.
I will assume, as what is familarly known to you all, and what is well
established by methods into which | will not enter, that the heavenly
bodies are at an immense distance from our earth. More especially is
this the case with the fixed stars. Their distance is so enormous that
even when we take as a base line, so to speak, the diameter of the
earth’s orbit, which we know to be about 184,000,000 of miles, the
apparent displacement of the stars due to parallax is so minute as
almost to elude our investigation. Nevertheless that distance is more
or less accurately determined in the case of a few of the fixed stars.
But the vast majority, as we have every reason to believe, are at such
an enormous distance that even this method fails with them.

To give a conception of the immense distance of the fixed stars, I
will assume as known that light travels at the rate of about 186,000
miles in one second, a rate which would carry it nearly eight times
round and round the earth in that time; and yet if we take the star
which, so far as we know, is our nearest neighbor, it would take about
four years for light from that star to reach the earth. Now as we
see the fixed stars there must be some link of connection between us
and them in order that we should be able to perceive them. Probably
all of you know that two theories have been put forward as to the
nature of light, as to the nature accordingly of that connection of

114 THE LUMINIFEROUS THER.

which I have spoken. According to one idea, light is a substance
darted forth from the luminous body with an amazing velocity; accord-
ing to the other, it consists in a change of state taking place, propa-
gated through a medium, as it is called, intervening between the body
from which the light proceeds and the eye of the observer. For a con-
siderable time the first of these theories was that chiefly adopted by
scientific men. It was that,as you know, which Newton himself adopted ;
and probably the prestige of his name had much to do with the favor-
able reception which for a long time it received. But more recent
researches have so completely established the truth of the other view,
and refuted the old doctrine of emissions, that it is now universally
held by scientific men that light consists in an undulatory movement
propagated in a medium existing in all the space through which light
is capable of passing.

This necessity for filling all space, or at least such an inconceivably
ereat extent of space, with a medium, the office of which, so far as was
known in the first instance, was simply that of propagating light, was
an obstacle for a time to the reception by the minds of some of the
theory of undulations. Men had been in the habit of regarding the
inter-planetary and inter-stellar space as a vacuum, and it seemed too
great an assumption to fill all this supposed vacuous space with some
kind of medium for the sole purpose of transmitting light. Notwith-
standing, even long ago strong opinions were entertained to the effect
that there must be something intervening between the different heav-
enly bodies. In a letter to Beutley, Newton expresses himself in very
strong language to this effect: “That gravity should be innate, inher-
ent and essential to matter, so that one body may act upon another at
a distance through a vacuum, without the mediation of anything else,
by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from
one to another, is to me so great an absurdity that I believe that no
man who has in philosophical matters a competent faculty of thinking,
ean ever fall into it. Gravity must be caused by an agent acting con-
stautly according to certain fixed laws; but whether this agent be
material or immaterial, I have left to the consideration of my readers.”

What theenature of the connection between the earth and the sun,
for example, may be whereby the sun is able to attract the earth and
thereby keep it in its orbit—in other words, what the cause of gravi-
tation may be—we do not know; for anything we know to the contrary,
it may be connected with this intermediate medium or luminiferous
«ether. There are other offices, we believe, which this luminiferous
wether fulfills, to which I shall have occasion to allude presently.

In connection with the necessity for filling such vast regions of space
with this medium, a curious question naturally presents itself. We
can not conceive of space as other than infinite, but we habitually think
of matter as occupying here or there limited portions of space, as for
example the different heavenly bodies. The intervening space we

THE LUMINIFEROUS THER. 115

commonly think of as a vacuum, and it is only the phenomena of light
that led us in the first instance to think ot it as filled with some kind
of material. The question naturally presents itself to the mind—is this
wether absolutely infinite like space? This is a question to which
science can give no answer. Though we can not help thinking of space
as infinite, yet when we turn our thoughts to some material existing In
space perhaps we more readily think of it as finite than infinite. But
if the «ther, however vast the portion of space over which it extends,
be really limited, we can hardly fail to speculate what there may be
outside its limits. Space there might be wholly vacuous, or possibly
outside altogether this vast system of stars and «ther there may be
another system subject to the same laws, or subject to different laws,
as the case may be, equally vast in extent; and if there be, then so far
as we can gather from such phenomena as are open to our investiga-
tion, there can be no communication between that vast portion of
space in part of which we live and an ideal system altogether outside
the «ther of which we have been speaking.

sut the properties of the «ther ave no less remarkable than its vast
or even possibly limitless extent. Matter of which our senses give us
any cognisance 1s heavy, that is to say, it gravitates toward other
matter which agrees with it in so far as being accessible to our senses.
The question presents itself to the mind, does the wether gravitate
toward what we call ponderable matter? This is a question to which
wesare not able to give any positive scientific answer. If the «ther be
in some way or other connected with the cause of gravitation 1t would
seem more likely that it itself does not gravitate toward ponderable
matter.

Again, we have very strong reason for believing that ponderable
matter consists of ultimate molecules. First, that supposition accords
in the simplest way with the laws of crystallography. Chemical laws
afford still stronger confirmation of the hypothesis, through the atomic
theory of Dalton, now universally accepted. Comparatively recently,
the deduction of the fundamental property of gases from the kinetie
theory, as itis called, affords strong additional confirmation of that
view of the constitution of matter. Still more recently, the explana-
tion which has been afforded by that theory of that most remarkable
instrumentthe “radiometer” of Crookes has lent further confirmation in
the same direction. None of these evidences apply to the wether, and
accordingly we are left in doubt whether it too consists of ultimate
molecules, or whether on the other hand it is continuous, as we can not
help conceiving space to be.

The undulatory theory of light was greatly promoted in the first
instance by the known phenomena of sound, and the explanation which
they received from the hydro-dynamical theory. Accordingly, since
sound, as we know, consists of an undulatory movement propagated

upon condensation and rarefaction, it was supposed naturally that
light was propagated in a similar manner, by virtue of the forces brought
into play by the condensation and rarefaction of the wether. But there
is one whole class of phenomena which have actually no counterpart
in those of sound; I refer to polarization and double refraction.

The evidence for the truth of the theory of undulations as regards
the phenomena of common light depends in great measure upon the
fact of interference and the explanation which the theory gives of the
complicated phenomena of diffraction. But in studying the interfer-
ence of polarized light, additional phenomena presented themselves
which ultimately pointed out that the vibrations with which we are
concerned in the case of the «ther differ altogether in their character
from those which belong tosound. The phenomena of the interference
of polarized light prove incontestably that there exists in light an
element of some kind having relation to directions transverse to that
of propagation, and admitting of composition and resolution in a plane
perpendicular to the direction of transmission according to the very
same laws as those of the composition and resolution of forces, or
velocities, or displacements in such a plane. This requires us to
attribute to the wether a constitution altogether different from that of
air. It points out the existence of a sort of elasticity whereby the
wether tends to check the gliding of one layer over another. Have we
no example of such a force in the case of ponderable matter? We have.
We know that an elastic solid, which for simplicity I will suppose to
be unerystalline, and alike in all directions, has two kinds of elasticity,
by one of which it, like air, tends to resist compression and rarefaction ;
while by the other it tends to resist a continuous gliding of one portion
over another, and to restore itself to its primitive state if such a
gliding has taken place. There is no direct relation between the
magnitude of these two kinds of elasticity, and in the case of an elastic
solid such as jelly the resistance to compression is enormously great
compared to the resistance to a gliding displacement.

If we assume that in the ether there is really an elasticity tending to
restore it to its primitive condition when one layer tends to glide over
another, an elasticity which it appears to be absolutely necessary to
admit in order to account for the observed laws of interference of polar-
ized light, the question arises, can we thereby explain double refrac-
tion?

The earliest attempts to explain it in accordance with the theory of
transverse vibrations were made by attributing to the «ther a molecular
constitution more or less analogous to that which we believe to exist in
ponderable matter. Following out speculations founded upon that
view, the celebrated Fresnel was led to the discovery of the actual
laws of double refraction; the theory however which he gave was by
no means complete, inasmuch as the results were not rigorously deduced
from the premises, Cauchy and Neumann, independently and about
THE LUMINIFEROUS THER. ney

simultaneously, took up Fresnel’s view of the constitution of the ether
and applied it to explain the laws of double refraction. In their theory
the conclusions arrived at were rigorously derived from the premises;
but the results did not altogether agree with observation; that is to
say, although they could by the adoption of certain suppositions be
forced into a near accordance with the observed laws of double refrac-
tion, yet they pointed out the necessity of the existence of other phe-
nomena which were belied by observation. Our own countryman Green
was the first to deduce Fresnel’s laws from a rigorous dynamical theory;
although nearly simultaneously, MacCullagh arrived at a theory in
some respects similar, though on the whole I think less satisfactory.

Still all these theories followed pretty closely the analogy of ponder-
able matter; and at least in the first three mentioned the wether was
even imagined to consist of discrete molecules, acting on one another,
like the bodies of the solar system regarded as points, by forces in the
direction of the joining line, and varying as some function of the dis-
tance. I have already quoted the very strong language in which New-
ton rejected the idea of the heavenly bodies acting on one another
across intervening spaces which were absolutely void. But the concep-
tion has nothing to do with the magnitude of the intervening spaces;
and the conception of action at a distance across an intervening space
which is absolutely void, is not a bit easier when the space in question
is merely that separating two adjacent molecules, when the wether is
thought of as consisting of discrete molecules, than it is when the space
is that separating two bodies of the solar system, though in this latter
caseit may amount to many millions of miles. If the sether be in some
unknown manner the link of connection whereby two heavenly bodies
are enabled to exert on one another the attraction of gravitation, then
according to the hypothetical constitution of the wether that we have
been considering, we seem compelled to invent an wether of the second
order, so to speak, to form a link of connection between two separate
molecules of the luminiferous «ther. But since the nature of the wther
is so very different as it must be from that of ponderable matter, it may
be that the true theory must proceed upon lines in which our previous
conceptions derived from the study of ponderable matter are in great
measure departed from.

If we think of the «ether asa sort of gigantic jelly, we can hardly
imagine but that it would more or less resist the passage of the heav-
enly bodies—the planets for instance—through it. Yet there appears
to be no certain indication of any such resistance. It has been
observed indeed in the case of Encke’s comet, that at successive revo-
lutions the comet returned to its perihelion a little before the caleu-
lated time. This would be accounted for by the supposition that it
experienced a certain amount of resistance from the «ther. Although
at first sight we might be disposed to say that such a resistance would
retard perihelion passage, yet the fact that it would accelerate it
118 THE LUMINIFEROUS THER.

becomes easily intelligible, if we consider that the resistance experi-
enced would tend to check its motion, and so prevent it from getting
away so far from the sun at aphelion, and would consequently bring it
more nearly into the condition of a planet circulating round the sun in
a Smaller orbit.

Many years ago I asked the highest authority in this country on
physical astronomy, the late Prof. Adams, what he thought of the evi-
dence afforded by Encke’s comet for the existence of a retarding force,
such as might arise from the wether. He said to me that he thought we
did not know enough as to whether there might not possibly be a planet
or planets within the orbit of Mercury which would account for it in a
different way. But quite independently of such a supposition it is
worthy of note that the remarkable phenomena presented by the tails
of comets render it by no means unlikely that even without the presence
of a resisting medium, and without the disturbing force arising from
the attraction of an unknown planet situated so near to the sun as not
to have been seen hitherto, the motion of the head of a comet might
not be quite the same as that of a simple body representing the nucieus,
and being subject to the gravitation of the sun and planets and noth-
ing else. It appears that the tails consist of some kind of matter
driven from the comet with an enormous velocity by a sort of repulsion
emanating from the sun. If the nucleus loses in this manner at each
perihelion passage an exceedingly small portion of its mass, which is
repelled from the sun, it is possible that the residue may experience an
attraction towards the sun over and above that due to gravitation, and
that possibly this may be the cause of the observed acceleration in the
time of passing perihelion even though there be no resistance on the
part of the wether. So that the question of resistance or no resistance
must be left an open one.

The supposition that the «ther would resist in this manner a body
moving through it is derived from what we observe in the case of solids
moving through fluids, liquid or gaseous, as the case may be. In ordi-
nary cases of resistance, the main representative of the work appar-
ently lost in propelling the solid is in the first instance the molecular
kinetic energy of the trail of eddies in the wake. The formation of
these eddies is however an indirect effect of the internal friction, or
if we prefer the term—viscosity, of the fluid. Now the viscosity of gases
has been explained on the kinetic theory of gases, and in the case of a
liquid we cannot well doubt that it is connected with the constitution
of the substance as not being absolutely continuous but molecular.
But if the cether be either non-molecular, or molecular in some totally
different sense from ponderable matter, we cannot with safety infer
that the motion of a solid through it necessarily implies resistance.

The luminiferous zether touches on another mysterious agent, the
nature of which is unknown, although its laws are in many respects
known, and it is applied to the every-day wants of life, and its appli-

cations are even regulated by Acts of Parliament; I allude to electric-
ity. I said that the nature of electricity isunknown. More than forty
years ago I was sitting at dinner beside the illustrious Faraday, and I
said to him that I thought a great step would have been madeif we
could say of electricity something analogous to what we say of light,
when we affirm that light consists of undulations; and he said to me
that he thought we were a long way off that at present. But, as I said
relations have recently been discovered between light and electricity
which lead us to believe that the latter is most closely connected with
the luminiferous wether.

Clark-Maxwell showed that the ratio of two electrical constants
(which are capable of being determined by laboratory experiments, and
which are of such a nature that that ratio expresses a velocity) agrees
with remarkable accuracy with the known velocity of light. This
formed the starting-point of the electro-magnetic theory of light which
is so Closely associated with the name of Maxwell.
ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS.*

1

By Sir RoBERT BALL, F. R. 8.

In recent years an important change has taken place in the manner
in which many physical problems are approached. The philosopher
who now seeks an explanation of great natural phenomena not unfre-
quently finds much assistance from cerfaim remarkable discoveries as to
the ultimate constitution of matter. Many an obscure question in
physies has been rendered clear when some of the properties of mole-
cules have been brought to light. No doubt our knowledge of the
natural history of the molecule is still vastly wanting in detail. It
must however be admitted that we have traced an outhne of that
wonderful chapter in nature which is specially serviceable in the ques-
tion which I now propose to discuss.

The problem before us may be stated in the following terms. We
have to illustrate how the sun is enabled to maintain its tremendous
expenditure of light and heat without giving any signsof appproaching
exhaustion. It will be found that the atomic theory of the constitu-
tion of matter exhibits the mechanism of the process by which that
capacity of the great luminary for supplying the radiation so vital to
the welfare of mankind is sustained from age to age. -

Let me here anticipate an objection which may not improbably be
raised. Those who have paid attention to this subject are aware that
the remarkable doctrine first propounded by Helmholtz removed all
real doubt from the matter. It is to this eminent philosopher we owe
an explanation of what at first seemed to be a paradox. He explained
how, notwithstanding that the sun radiates its heat so profusely, no
indications of the inevitable decline of heat can be as yet discovered.
If the sun had been made of solid coal from center to surface, and if
that coal had been burned for the purpose of sustaining the radiation,
it can be demonstrated that a few thousand years of solar expenditure
at the present rate would suffice to exbaust all the heat which the com-
bustion of that great sphere of fuel could generate. We know how:
ever that the sun has been radiating heat, not alone for thousands of
years, but for millions of years. The existence of fossil plants and ani-
mals would alone suffice to demonstrate this fact. We have thus to

122 ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS.

account for the extremely remarkable circumstance that our great
luminary has radiated forth already a thousand times as much heat as
could be generated by the combustion of a sphere of coal as big as the
sun is at present, and yet, notwithstanding this expenditure in the
past, physics declares that for millions of years to come the sun may
continue to dispense light and heat to its attendant worlds with the
same abundant prodigality. To have shown how the apparent para-
dox could be removed is one of the most notable achievements of the
great German philosopher.

What Helmoltz did was to refer to the obvious fact that the expendi-
ture of heat by radiation must necessarily lead to shrinkage of the
solar volume. This shrinkage has the effect of abstracting from a store
of potential energy in the sun and transforming what it takes into the
active form of heat. The transformation advances pari passu with the
radiation, so that the loss of heat arising from the radiation is restored
by the newly produced heat derived from the latent reservoir. Suchis
an outline of the now famous doctrine universally accepted among
physicists. It fulfils the conditions of the problem, and when tested
by arithmetical calculation it is not found wanting.

But the genuine student of nature loves to get to the heart of a great
problem like this. He loves to be able to follow it, not through mere
formule or abstract principles, but so as to be able to visualise its truth
and feel its certainty. He will therefore often desire something in
addition to the bare presentation of the theory as above stated. It
may be no doubt sufficient for the mathematician to know that the total
potential energy it the sun, due to the dispersed nature of its materi-
als, is so vast that as contraction brings the materials, on the whole,
somewhat nearer together, the potential energy thus surrendered is
transformed into a supply of heat quite adequate to compensate for the
losses arising from the radiation by which the contraction was pro-
duced. The student who admits—and who is there that does not
admit ?—the doctrine of the conservation of energy, knows that in this
argument he 1s on thoroughly reliable ground. At the same time the
argument does not actually offer any very clear conception, or indeed
any conception at all, of the precise modus operandi by which, as the
active potential energy vanishes, its equivalent in available heat
appears. Ihave always felt that this was the unsatisfactory part of
an otherwise perfect theory. It was therefore with much interest that
I became acquainted a short time ago with a development of the mole-
cular theory of gases, which afforded precisely what seemed wanted to
make every link in the chain of the great argument distinctly percepti-
ble. I make no doubt that the notions which have occurred to me on
this subject must have presented themselves to others also. I have
however not read in print or heard in conversation any use made of the
illustration that I am going to set forth. I feel therefore confident
that even if it be known at all,it is certainly not generally known
*

among the large and ever-increasing circle of readers to whom the
great questions of physies are of interest.

The division of matter into the three forms of solids, liquids, and
gases has acquired in these days a special significance now that the
constitution of matter is becoming in some degree understood. First
let it be noted that, though matter is capable of subdivision to a cer-
tain extent, yet that there is a limit beyond which subdivision could
not be carried. This statement touches upon the ancient controversy
as to the infinite divisibility of matter. Even still we can find the
statement in some of our old text-books that there is no particle of mat-
ter so small that it could not be again subdivided into half. No doubt
(so far aS most ordinary experience goes) this statement may be unques-
tionable. It is quite true that we do not often reduce matter to frag-
ments so small that each of them shall be insusceptible of further con-
ceivable division. But, to illustrate the natural principle now under
consideration, let us take the example of a body which is itself com-
posed of but a single element. Think for instance of a diamond,
which is, as we all know, a portion of crystallized carbon. It is true
that the reduction of diamonds to powder is a laborious process. Still,
diamond dust has to be produced in the finishing of the rough stone,
and this element will serve the purpose of our present argument better
than a substance of a composite nature. Each particle of the diamond
dust is, of course, as much a particle of carbon as was the original
crystal. We may however suppose that by a repetition of the process
a reduction of the diamond dust to powder still finer is accomplished.
The-grains thus obtained may have become so minute that they have
ceased to be visible to the unaided eye, and require a microscope to
render them perceptible; but even after this comminution each of these
particles is still a veritable diamond. It possesses the properties,
optical, chemical, and mechanical, of the original gem, from which it
differs merely in the attribute of size. Even when the disintegration
has been carried to such a point that each individual particle can be
only just perceived by the keenest power of the most powerful micro-
scope, there is still no indication that the particles cease to possess
the characteristics of the original body.

These facts being undoubted, it was perhaps not unnatural to suppose
that the reduction could be carried on indefinitely, and that even if the
smallest fragment of diamond which could be seen in a powerful micro-
scope were reduced to a millionth part, and each of those to a million
more, yet that the ultimate particles thus reached would be diamonds
still. Now. however, we know that that is not the case. The smallest
particle visible under a microscope might indeed be crushed into a thou-
sand parts, and each one of those parts, though wholly inappreciable to
our sense of touch or vision, would nevertheless be a genuine diamond.
If however the subdivision be carried on until the particles produced
are, roughly speaking, one-millionth part of the bulk of the smallest
~~

objects which could be seen in the microscope, we then approach the
limits of partition of which the diamonds would be susceptible. We
now know that there is an atom of diamond so small that it must refuse
to undergo any further division. This ultimate atom, be it observed,
is not an infinitely small quantity. It has definite dimensions; it pos-
sesses a definite weight. All such diamond atoms are precisely alike
in weight, and probably in other characteristics. It might be thought
that if this atom has finite dimensions, it is, at all events, conceivable
that it should admit of further subdivision. In a certain sense this is,
no doubt, the case. The diamond atom is made up of parts and being
so made it is of course conceivable that those parts could be separated.
The important point to notice is, that no means known to us could pro-
duce this separation, while it is perfectly certain that if the decompo-
sition of the atom of diamond into distinct parts could be affected, those
parts would not be diamonds at all, nor anything in the least resembling
diamonds.

What we have said as regards the element carbon may be extended
to every other elementary substance. Sulphur is familiarly known in
a form of extreme subdivision, and each little particle of sulphur could
be further comminuted to a certain point beyond which any further
partition would be impossible. So too any composite body, such for
example as a lump of sugar, admits of being decomposed into mole-
cules so small that any further separation would be impossible if the
molecule were still to remain sugar. No doubt, a separation of the
molecule of any composite body into constituent atoms of other elements
is not alone possible but is incessantly taking place.

The first step in our knowledge of the constitution of matter has been
taken when we have come to recognize that every body is composed of
a multitude of extremely, but not infinitely, small molecules. The next
point relates to the condition in which these molecules are found. At
first it might be thought that in a solid, at all events, the little particles
must be clustered together in acompact ass. If we depended merely
on sensible evidence it would seem that a lump of iron, if constituted
from molecules at all, must be simply a cohering mass of particles, just
as a multitude of particles of sand unite to form a lump of sandstone.
But the truth is far.more wonderful than such a belief would imply.
Were the sensibility of our eyes so greatly increased as to make them
a few million times more powerful than our present organs, then indeed
the display of the texture of solid matter would be an astonishing rev-
elation. It would be seen that the diamond atoms, which, when aggre-
gated in sufficient myriads, form the perfect gem, were each in a condi-
tion of rapid movement of the most complex description; each molecule
would be seen swinging to and fro with the utmost violence among the
neighboring molecules. It would be seen quivering all over under the
influence of the shocks which it would receive from the vehement en-
counters with other molecules which occur millions of times in each
ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS. 125

second. Such would be the minute anatomy of the diamond. The well-
known properties of such gems seem, at first sight, wholly at variance
with the curious structure we have assigned to them. Surely, it may be
said that the hardness and the impenetrability so characteristic of the
diamond refute at once the supposition thatit isno more than a cluster of
rapidly moving particles. But the natural philosopher now knows that
his explanation of the qualities of the diamond holds the field against
allother explanations. The well-known impenetrability of the diamond
seems to arise from the fact that when you try to press a steel point
into the stone you fail to do so because the rapidly moving molecules
of the gem batter the end of the steel point with such extraordinary
vehemence that they refuse to allow it to penetrate or even to mark the
crystallized surface. When you cut glass with a diamond it is quite
true that the edge, which seems so intensely hard, is really composed
of rapidly moving atoms. But the glass which 1s submitted to the
operation is also merely a mass of moving molecules, and what seems
to happen is that, as the diamond is pressed forward, its several parti-
cles, by their superior vigor, drive the little particles of glass out of the
way. We do not see the actual details of the myriad encounters in
which the diamond atoms are victorious over the glassy molecules; we
only discern the broad result that the diamond has done its work, and
that the glass has been cut.

It may well be asked how we know that matter is constituted of
molecules in intensely rapid movement. The statement seems at the
first glance to be so utterly at variance with our ordinary experience
that we demand, and rightly demand, some convincing proof on the
matter. There are many arguments by which the required demon-
stration can be forthcoming. The one which I shall! give is not perhaps
the most conclusive, but it has the advantage of being one of the sim-
plest and the most readily intelligible.

Let us see if we can not prove at once that the molecules in, let us
Say, a piece of iron must be in movement. Suppose that the iron is
warmed so that it radiates heat to a perceptible extent. We know
that the heat which, in this case, affects our nerves has been trans-
mitted from its origin by e«therial undulations. Those undulations
have undoubtedly been set in motion by the iron, and yet the parts
of the metal seem quite motionless relatively to each other, notwith-
standing that they possess the power of setting the wether into vibra-
tion. Itis impossible that such vibrations could be produced were it
not that there is in the iron a something which vibrates in such a
manner as to communicate the necessary pulses to the ether. It
therefore follows that in the texture of the solid iron there must be
some molecular movement, timed in such a way as to impart to the
ether the actual vibrations which we find if to possess. The argument
in this case may be illustrated by the analogous phenomena presented
in the case of sound, As we listen to the notes of a violin, what we
126 ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS.

actually perceive are vibrations communicated through the air to the
auditoryapparatus. We can trace these aerial vibrations back to their
source, and we find they originate from the quivering of the violin
under the influence of the bow of the performer. Were it not for these
vibrations of the instrument the aerial vibrations would not be pro-
duced, and the corresponding sounds would not be heard. Far more
delicate than the atmospheric waves of sound are the «therial waves
corresponding to hght or to heat, but none the less must these latter
also originate from the impulse of some vibrating mass, It is thus
apparent that a hot piece of iron, however still it may seem, must be
animated by an excessively rapid molecular movement. Nor is the
validity of this conclusion impaired even if the iron be at ordinary
temperature. We know that a body which is no hotter than the sur-
rounding bodies is still incessantly radiating heat to them and receiving
heat from them in return. Thus we are led to the conviction that a
piece of iron, whatever be its temperature, must consist of atoms in a
state of lively movement. The important conclusion thus drawn with
regard to iron may be equally stated with respect to every other solid,
or, indeed, every other body, whether solid, liquid, or gaseous. All
matter of every description is not only Sateen to be composed of mole-
cules, but it is ae now certain that those molecules are incessantly
performing movements of a very complex type.

A closer study of this subject will be necessary for our present pur-
pose, and it will be convenient to examine matter in that state in which
itis exhibited in its very simplest type from the molecular point of
view. This condition is not presented, as might at first be supposed,
when the matter is solid, like a diamond, or like a piece of iron. Even
in a liquid the complexity of molecular constitution, though somewhat
less than in the case of a solid, is still notably greater than in matter
which has the gaseous form. The air that we breathe is matter almost
of the most simple kind, so far as molecular constitution is concerned.
It should however be noted, that as air consists of a mixture, it would
be better for our purpose to think of a gas isolated from any other ele-
ment. Let us take the case of oxygen, the most important constituent .
of our atmosphere.

Like every other element, oxygen is composed of molecules, and those
molecules are in a state of rapid motion. It might be expected that
the affinity by which the different molecules were allied in the case of
a gas should be of the simplest nature, and this is indeed found to be
the case. Notwithstanding that oxygen is an invisible body, and not-
withstanding that the molecules are so excessively minute as to be
severally quite inappreciable to our senses, yet we have been able to
learn a great deal with regard to the constitution of the molecules of
this gas. The mental eye of the philosopher shows him that though
the oxygen with which a jar is filled appears to be perfectly quiescent,
yet that quiescence has there no real existence. He knows that oxygen
ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS. 127

consists of myriads of molecules identical in weight and in other
features, and darting about one among the other with velocities which
vary perhaps between those of express trains and those of rifle bullets.
He sees that each little molecule hurries along quite freely for a while
until it happens to encounter some other molecule equally bent on its
journey, and then a collision takes place. Perhaps it would be more
correct to say that what usually happens is that the two impinging
molecules make a very close approach; then each of them so vehemently
attracts the other as to make it swerve out of its course and start it off
along a path, inclined, it may be, even at aright angle to that which
it previously pursued. The molecules in a gas at ordinary pressures
are so contiguous that these encounters take place incessantly; in fact,
we are able to show that each individual molecule will probably expe-
rience such adventures some millions of times in the course of each
second. Weare able to calculate the average velocity with which the
several molecules move when the gas has a certain temperature. We
know how to determine the average length of the free path which each
molecule traverses in the interval betweeu two consecutive encounters.
We are able to trace how ali these circumstances would vary if, instead
of oxygen gas, we took nitrogen, or hydrogen, or any other body in the
same molecular state. It is in fact characteristic of every gas that
each molecule wanders freely, subject only to those incessant encoun-
ters with other similar wanderers by which its path is so frequently’
disturbed. If two gases be placed in the same vessel, one being laid
over the other, it will presently be found that the two gases begin to
blend; ere long one gas will have diffused uniformly through the other,
so that the two will have become a perfect mixture just as the oxygen
and nitrogen have done in our own atmosphere. The molecular theory
of gases explains at once the actual character of the operation by whieh
diffusion is effected. Across the boundary which initially separates
the two gases certain molecules are projected from either side, and this
process of interchange goes on until the molecules become uniformly
aistributed throughout.

There is indeed nothing more remarkable than the fact that infor-
mation so copious and so recondite can be obtained in a region which
lies altogether beyond the direct testimony of the senses. Just as the
astronomer staggers our powers of conception by the description of
appalling distances and stupendous periods of time, and relies with con-
fidence on the evidence which convinces him of the reality of his state-
ments, so the physicist avails himself of a like potent method of research
to study distances so minute and times so brief that the imagination
utterly fails to realize them.

In the case of a liquid, the freedom enjoyed by the molecules is con-
siderably more restricted than in the case of a gas. It would seem that
in the denser fluid there can be no intervals of undisturbed travel per-
mitted to a molecule; itis almost incessantly in a state of encounter
128 ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS.

with some other similar object. When a molecule in a liquid breaks
away from its association with one group, it is only because it has
entered into alliance with another. As however two liquids will very
frequently blend if so placed that diffusion be possible, we have a proof
that, though the transference of a particular molecule through the
liquid may be comparatively slow, yet it will gradually exchange asso-
ciation with one group for association with another, and may in this
way travel throughout any distance to which the liquid extends.

In the case of a solid there is still further limitation imposed on the
mobility of each separate molecule. It is now no longer permitted to
make excursions throughout the entire volume of the body. Each
molecule is inrapid motion, it is true, but those movements are confined
to gyrations within minutely circumscribed limits. Two solids placed
in contact do not generally diffuse one into the other, the incapacity for
diffusion being the direct consequence of the inferior degree of mobility
possessed by the molecules in this condition of matter.

It is known that the immediate effect of the application of heat is to
increase the velocities with which the molecules move. Apply heat,
for instance, to the water in a kettle; the moving molecules of water
are thereby stimulated to even greater activity and it will occasionally
happen that the velocity thus acquired by a molecule becomes so great
that the little particle will swing clear away from the influence of the
other molecules with which it had been associated. When this takes
place in the case of a sufficient number of molecules, they dart freely
from the surface of the hquid, thus producing the effect which in our
ordinary language we describe as giving off steam. If therefore a
volume of gas be heated, the velocities with which its molecules are
animated will be in general increased. As the molecular velocities
throughout the extent of the gas are on the whole augmented, it is
quite plain that the intensities of the shocks experienced by the mole-
cules in their several encounters will be also accentuated. The more
rapidly moving particles will strike each against the other with increased
violence, and the contemplation of this single fact leads us close to one
of nature’s greatest secrets.

Let us think of the abounding heat which is dispensed to us from
the sun. That heat comes, as we know, in the form of undulations
imparted to the wther by the heated matter in the sun, and transmit-
ted thence across space for the benefit of the earth and its inhabitants.
I have already explained that these vibrations in the «ther must take
their rise from molecular movements, and it is important to notice
that the character of the vibrations in the ether enables us to learn to
some extent the precise description of molecular movements which
alone would be competent to produce the particular vibrations corre-
sponding to radiant heat. At first it might be thought that it was the
rapid movements of translation of the molecules themselves, as entire
if extremely minute bodies, which caused the etherial vibration, but
ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS. 129

this is not so. Wemust carefully observe that there 1s another kind
of molecular motion besides that which the molecule possesses as a
whole. We have hitherto been occupied only with the movements of
each molecule as a little projectile pursuing its zigzag course, each
turn of the zigzag being the result of an encounter with some similar
molecule belonging to the same medium. But we have now to observe
that the molecule itselfas by no means to be regarded as a simple
rigid particle; indeed, if it were so it is certain that we should receive
no heat at all from the sun. We have the best reasons for believing
that the molecule of matter, so far from resembling a simple rigid par-
ticle, is an elaborate structure, whose parts are in some degree capable
of independent movement. It will not, indeed, be necessary for us to
adopt the splendid hypothesis of Lord Kelvin, which supposes that
molecules of matter are merely vortex rings in that perfect fluid, the
wether. It seems difficult to doubt that this doctrine represents the
facts, but if anyone should reject it, then [I have only to say that its
assumption is not required for our present argument. All that is
necessary for us is to regard each molecule as somewhat resembling an
elastic structure made of parts which can quiver like springs, and so
arranged as to be susceptible of many different modes of vibration.
We are to suppose that each molecule, in addition to the energy which
it possesses in virtue of its movement of translation as a whole, has
also a store of energy corresponding to the oscillations of its electric
springs. We can, in fact, in some cases determine the ratio which
exists between the amount of energy which is, on the average, pos-
sessed by molecules in consequence of their velocities of translation,
and the amount of energy which they possess in consequence of the
vibrations by which their several parts are animated. It is these
internal molecular vibrations which are of essential importance in our
present inquiry. It is believed that the radiation of light or of heat
generally takes rise in the impulses given to wther by the internal
molecular vibrations. Do we not know that the essential character-
istic of those wetherial movements which correspond to radiant light
and heat is that they have the nature of oscillations? Such could not
be imparted by mere rectilinear movements of the molecules as a whole.
They must be due to those internal oscillations by which the actual
molecules are animated.

No doubt it is difficult to realize that much can be learned with
regard to the performances that actually go on in the internal parts of
a molecule, especially when it is remembered that each molecule in its
entirety is so extremely minute as to be entirely beyond the reach of
our organs of sense. It is nevertheless impossible to doubt that the
statements just made correspond to the veritable facts of nature. It
would be impracticable here to go into any complete detail with regard
to the evidence on this subject; I can only sketch an outline of it. Let
us take, perhaps as the simplest case, that presented by hydrogen.

SM 93——9
130 ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS.

At the ordinary temperature of the air, hydrogen is of course invisi.
ble; this means that the vibrations in the interior of the molecules are
not sufficiently vehement to impart pulses to thevether with the energy
that would be required to produce visual effects. Now, let us suppose
that the hydrogen is heated. The effect of heating is to impart addi-
tional speed to the molecules of the gas, and consequently when the
molecules happen to come together their encounter is more violent.
The effect of such an occurrence on one of these little elastic bodies is
to set it quivering with greater vehemence in those particular modes
of vibration for which it is tuned. If the temperature of the gas has
been raised sufficiently high, as it can be by the aid of electricity,
then the internal energy acquired by the molecules, in consequence of
the increased vehemence of their collisions, has become so great that
they are able to impart pulses to the wether with sufficient intensity to
affect our nerves of vision; thereupon we declare that the hydrogen is
now so hot as to have become luminous. Suppose we employ a spectro-
scope for the purpose of studying the particular character of the light
which the glowing hydrogen dispenses. It will appear that the spee-
trum consists of a definite number of bright lines. We know that each
one of these lines corresponds to a particular period of vibration of the
wether, and hence we see that the light emitted by the hydrogen does
not consist of vibrations of all periods indiscriminately, but only of cer-
tain particular waves which are in unison with the oscillations to which
the internal parts of the molecule of hydrogen are adopted. Had we
examined the spectrum of some other gas in a state of incandescence
we should have found a wholly different system of lines from those per-
taining to hydrogen. This demonstrates that the molecules of one gas
differ essentially from those of another in respect to the character of
the internal vibrations which they are adapted to perform, The extra-
ordinary activity of the movements which take place within the mole-
cules nay be appreciated from the following facts. We know that the
wave corresponding to one of the hydrogen lines has a length of about
the forty-thousanth of an inch; we also know that in a single second of
time light travels over a space of 186,000 miles; a simple calculation
will, therefore, assure us that certain vibrations in the molecules of
hydrogen corresponding to this particular undulation must take place
with such an extraordinary frequency that about 460 millions of millions
of them are performed in each second of time.

Provided with these conceptions we shall now, I think, be able to
see without difficulty how it is that the sun’s heat is sustained. We
may, for our present purpose, think of the great luminary as a mass
of glowing gas. Itis quite true that the physical condition of the
matter in the interior of the tremendous globe can hardly be that
which we ordinarily consider as gaseous. But this need not affect our
argument. It is undoubtedly true that those portions of the solar
atmosphere from which the light and heat are mainly dispensed are
ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS. Vt

gaseous in their character, or, at all events, come sufficiently near to
matter in the gaseous state to permit the application of the line of

rgument with which we have hitherto been engaged. In consequence
of the vast mass of the sun the gravitation with which it draws all
bodies towards it is very much greater than the gravitation on the
surface of the earth. On our globe we know that the effect of gravita-
tion is to impart to any body near the surface velocity directed towards
the earth’s center at the rate of 32 feet per second. The sun is more
than three hundred thousand times as massive as the earth; we can
not however assert that the gravitation is increased in the same pro-
portion, because, on account of the vast size of the sun, a particle at
its surface is more than a hundred times farther away from the solar
center than a body on the surface of the earth is from the terrestrial
center. It can however be shown, that taking these various matters
into account, the actual intensity of gravitation at the solar surface is
sufficient to tend to impart to all objects an increase of velocity towards
the sun’s center at the rate of 457 feet per second. This would apply
not only to a meteorite, or other considerable mass, which is falling
into the sun; it would be equally true of an object as small as a mole-
cule. Every one of the myriads of gaseous molecules in the outer
regions of the solar atmosphere must be constantly acted upon by this
attractive force, which tends in the course of each second to add to
them a downward velocity at that rate per second which has already
been stated. It is quite true that to a great extent the effect of this
attraction is masked by counteracting tendencies. In particular we
may mention that inasmuch as the density of the solar atmosphere
increases as the sun’s center is approached, the flying molecule gener-
erally finds itself more obstructed by encounters with other molecules
when it is descending than when it is ascending.

We may here contrast the condition of the atmosphere on the earth
with the condition of the solar atmosphere. Each molecule in our air,
being acted upon by terrestrial gravitation, has thereby a tendency to
fall downward with a velocity continually increasing at the rate of 32
feet per second. As however the terrestrial atmosphere has long since
reached a stable condition, in whicli it undergoes no further contrac.
tion, the effect of gravitation in adding velocity to the molecules is so
completely masked by the counteracting tendencies, that on the whole,
there is no continual increase of molecular velocities downward due to
gravitation. Were such an increase at present going on, we should
necessarily find that the terrestrial atmosphere was decreasing in vol-
ume, and ever becoming more condensed in its lower strata. It is
however well known that no such changes as are here implied are
taking place. The essential difference between the earth and the sun,
(so far as the matter now before us is concerned,) is to be found in the
fact that as the sun has not yet passed into the form of a rigid body,
it is still contracting at a rate very much greater than that at which a
L32 ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS.

body grown so cold as the earth draws its particles closer together.
The molecules in the solar photosphere accordingly yield to a certain
extent to the gravitation which constantly seeks to draw them down.
The counteracting tendencies can not in the sun, as they do in the
arth, mask the direct and obvious effect of gravitation. The conse-
quence is that the intense attraction which is capable of adding veloe-
ity to the molecules at the phenomenal rate of 457 feet per second, is per-
mitted to accomplish something, and thus increase the average speeds
with which the molecules hurry along. To express the matter a little
more accurately, we should say that the downward velocity imparted
by gravitation, being compounded with the velocities otherwise pos-
sessed by the molecules, tends, on the whole, to increase the rate at
which they move.

We shall now be able to discern what actually takes place as the sun
contracts by dispersing heat, and in consequence of its decline in bulk
finds a store of energy liberated which it is permitted to use for the
purpose of sustaining its radiating capacity. Owing to the intense
heat which prevails in the photosphere, the molecules must there be in
very rapid movement; their mutual encounters must be of the utmost
vehemence, and their internal vibrations, which are the consequences
of the shocks in the encounters, must be correspondingly energetic. It
is, aS we have seen, these internal molecular vibrations which set the
wether in motion, and thus dispense solar heat and light far and wide
through the universe. But this the molecules cam only do at the
expense of the energy which they possess in virtue of their internal
vibrations. Unless therefore the internal molecular energy were to
be in some way recuperated from time to time, the radiating power
must necessarily flag. It is now plain that the necessary recuperation
takes places in the successive encounters. A molecule whose internal
energy of vibration is becoming exhausted by the effort of setting the
wether into vibration presently impinges against some other molecule,
and in consequence of the blow is again set into active vibration which
permits it to carry on the work of radiation anew, until its declining
energies have again to be sustained by some similar addition arising
from a fresh collision. Of course, we know that the internal molecular
energy thus acquired can not be created out of nothing. If the mole-
cule receives such accessions of internal energy, it must be at the
expense of the energy which is elsewhere. Obviously the only possible
source of such energy must be found in the movement of the molecule
as a whole, that is to say, in the velocity of translation with which it
rushes about among the other molecules. Thus we see that the imme-
diate effect of expenditure of heat or light by radiation is to diminish
the internal energies of the molecules. These energies are restored by
the transference of energy obtained from the general velocities of the
molecules regarded as moving projectiles. It follows that the velocities
of the several particles must on the whole tend to decline; in other
ATOMS AND SUNBEAMS. ileys}

words, that the temperature tends to fall. What we have to discover
is the agent which at present prevents the solar temperature from
falling. We want therefore to ascertain the means by which the molec-
ular velocities are preserved at the same average value, notwith-
standing that there is a constant tendency for these velocities to abate
in consequence of the losses of light and heat by radiation. We have
already explained how the gravitation of the sun constantly tends to
impart additional downward velocity to the molecules in its atmos-
phere. This is precisely the action which we now require. The con-
traction of the sun tends to an augmentation of the molecular velocities,
and this augmentation just goes to supply the loss of velocities which
is the consequence of the radiation. A complete explanation of the
maintenance of the sun’s heat is thus afforded. Observation no doubt
seems to show that the capacity for radiation is at present sensibly
constant, and this being so, we see that the gain of molecular velocities
from gravitation and their losses from radiation are at present just
adapted to neutralize each other. Nothing however that has as yet
been said demonstrates that the efficiency of the sun for radiating light
and heat must always be preserved exactly at its present value.

It is quite possible that if we had the means of studying the sun
heat for a hundred thousand years, we might find that the capacity
for radiation was slightly decreasing, or it may be that it would be
slightly increasing, for it is at least conceivable that the gain of
molecular velocity due to gravitation may, on the whole, exceed the
loss due to the dispersal of energy by radiation. On the other hand,
itis of course possible that the acquisition of velocity by gravitation,
though nearly sufficient to countervail the expenditure by radiation,
may not be quite enough, in which case the sun’s temperature would be
slowly declining.

It must not however be supposed that the argument which we have
been here following attributes eternal vigor to the great luminary. It
will be noted that it is of the essence of the argument that the econ-
traction is still in progress. If the contraction were to cease, then the
restitution of velocity by gravitation would cease also, and the speedy
dispersal of the existing heat by radiation would presently produce
bankruptey in the supply of sunbeams. Indeed, such bankruptey
must arrive in due time, when, after certain millions of years, the sun
has so far contracted that it ceases to be a gaseous mass. The vast
accumulated store of energy which is now being drawn upon to supply
the current radiation, will then yield such supplies no longer. Once
this state has been reached, a few thousand years more must witness
the extinction of the sun altogether as a source of light, and the great
orb, at present our splendid luminary, will then pass over into the
ranks of the innumerable host of bedies which were once suns, but are
now suns no longer.
FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURKE.*

By T. C. MENDENHALL,

Superintendent of the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey.

Engineering is the art of construetion; but to limit it to this would
be to restrict its meaning much within the range of the ordinary use of
the word. In abroader sense, engineering includes all operations whose
object is the utilization of the forces of nature in the interests of man.
It is both an art and a science, and as a science it consists for the most
part of mathematics applied to physics and mechanics. It is of neces-
sity, therefore, a measuring science, and a congress of engineers ought,
in the nature of things, to be interested in anything relating to progress
in metrology.

Fortunately the literature of this subject is neither scanty nor diffi-
cult of access. Much attention has been given to it in all parts of the
world during the last half of this century, and in the United States
especially numerous and valuable papers and reports upon the subject
of weights and measures have appeared during this period. Indeed, it
would be difficult, if not impossible, to contribute to either the historical
or the controversial aspect of the question anything new and of notable
value.

In spite of an extensive and widely circulated literature, however, it
is very distinctly in evidence that the origin and genesis of the units
of measure in customary use in the United States and among most Eng-
lish-speaking people, and their relation or want of relation to each other,
are matters concerning which many engineers are not well informed.

Perhaps not a large majority of members of the profession in good
standing would be able to answer accurately the question, What is a
yard? or What is a pound? In view of this fact no excuse need be
oftered for presenting a statement of facts relating to fundamental
standards in this country at the present time, and for the sake of clear-
ness this statement will be prefaced by a brief consideration of the
principles involved in the evolution and selection of standards, together
with a résumé of genealogical history, showing their origin and ances-

try. Of the latter little detail will be given, as the extensive and easily
accessible literature upon the subject renders it unnecessary.

The measure of a magnitude is its numerical evaluation. Ina direct
way this is accomplished by ascertaining how many times it contains
another magnitude of the same kind or nature which is adopted as a
unit. Thus alength is selected as a unit for the measurement of length,
a volume for the measurement of volume, a time for time measurement,
and soon. At first it seems that this condition of sameness of the unit
and the thing measured is a necessity. <A little reflection will show,
however, that it is open to the objection that it naturally, although
perhaps not necessarily, leads to an almost indefinite multiplication of
independent units. The discovery and development of inter-relations
among measurable magnitudes, which has gone on from the earliest
times, has tended towards a reduction in the number of units and, con-
sequently, to a great simplification of the whole subject of metrology.
So simple and evident a device as relating the unit of volume to the
unit of length has only been satisfactorily realized in comparatively
modern times; and, with a single exception, it may be affirmed that
units of volume now in use were originally in no way related to units
of length, most of them being of accidental and now unknown origin.

That a legal bushel in the United States must contain 2150-42 cubie
inches is convincing evidence that the foot or the yard has no place in
its ancestry, and although there is a plausible explanation of the fact
that a gallon contains 251 cubic inches, it points only to a modified
volume and not a selected one.

Many interesting illustrations of the great advantage gained by
neglecting the principle that “like measures like” might be given, and
one or two will, perhaps, be found instructive. In observing that prop-
erty of matter known as “ conductivity,” either as to heat or electricity,
qualitative or relative conclusions were for a long time all that was
required. It was at first sufficient to say and to know that one sub-
stance conducted heat or electricity better or worse than another, but
with the advance of knowledge of physics it became desirable, and
often necessary, to give numerical expression to these relations. In
such cases as this the practice has usually been to select some partic-
war substance which possesses the property in question in a higher or
in a lower degree than any other and adopt it as a standard. Thus
barely a quarter of a century ago conductivities of different bodies for
heat or electricity were expressed in terms of copper or silver; a lamp-
black surface was the standard for radiation or absorption, and in most
instances the standard was arbitrarily rated at 100. The literature of
science contains many examples of elaborate and otherwise valuable
investigations which are rendered quite worthless by the uncertain and
unscientific units of measure employed. An example of the persistent
use of this principle is to be found in the still common mode of express-
ing the density of matter by referring it to the density of a certain
FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE. 137

kind of matter, namely, water, the numerical representation of the ratio
being known as “specific gravity.” It has taken some years for even
scientific men to fully appreciate the objectionable features of this sort
of metrology, because it has required some time to prove beyond doubt
that all kinds of copper or silver do not conduet. alike, nor do all sam-
ples of lampblack radiate alike; and also that the conditions under
which the density of water is constant are difficult of realization.

Another factor which has been, up to a very recent time, of first
importance in the selection of standards is the tendeney to seek in
nature something of constant dimensions or invariable mass which
possesses that general availability essential to adoption as standard.
The nomenclature of metrology bears testimony to this. In our own
customary system of weights and measures the occurrence of such
units as the foot, hand, grain, ell, ete., tells of the frequent recourse to
natural units. This is not alone characteristic of earlier and ruder
systems, but in modern metrology we have recorded the efforts of sci-
entific men to realize this theoretically desirable condition in the selee-
tion of the quadrant of the earth, the length of a seconds pendulum,
and the wave length of a particular kind of light for linear standards.
The only natural standard which up to this time can be said to have
satisfied the requirements is the unit of time, which is the sidereal day.
This might itself be considered a derived rather than a fundamental
unit, and, indeed, it is difficult to conceive of any time unit other than
one based on motion. The motion of the earth is assumed to be a uni-
form rotatory motion, and the unit is the duration of a single revolu-
tion. Vibratory or periodic motion seems to offer many advantages as
a time standard, and various forms have been suggested from time to
time. It has been shown that the period of a freely suspended inva-
riable pendulum furnishes in practice a more uniform and constant
time unit than the best clocks or chronometers. All standards of this
type depend on the persistence of gravity, however, and of this we can
not be assured. The prime requisites of a standard are constaney and
universal availability, and as the present time unit, the sidereal day,
possesses these in a high degree it is not likely that it will soon be
supplanted. It would be extremely desirable, however, if a unit of
time could be devised which would survive such terrestrial or celestial
disturbances as would materially alter the revolution of the earth upon
its axis. Something of this kind is necessary if time observations made
during the present cycle are to be available in future ages, and it is
possible that the determination of the relation of the wave length of
light to the generally accepted unit of length may indirectly furnish a
time unit possessing this characteristic in a high degree.

The greatest advance in the science of metrology in modern times is
essentially due to Gauss, and it consists of the so-called “absolute”
system of measurement. Quite as much as to the author of this ingen-
ious system metrologists are indebted to the celebrated British Asso-
138 FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE.

ciation Committee on Units, led by Lord Kelvin, and including such
men as Clerk Maxwell, Foster, Stoney, Fleeming Jenkin, Siemens,
Bramwell, Adams, Balfour Stewart, and Everett. Evincing a freedom
from national prejudices worthy of the distinguished body which they
represented, this committee placed the system of Gauss upon a firm
and enduring basis by deriving its fundamental units from the only
system of weights and measures which, starting from a scientific basis
and constructed upon scientific principles, has ever found favor among
a considerable number of people, and which has now become well-nigh
universal.

The tendency of the absolute system is towards simplicity through
a reduction of the number of fundamental units to a minimum, while
at the same time it affords every facility for the multiplication of
derived units to meet the demands of convenience in practice. But
however complex and numerous these derived units may be, they all
grow out of the same elements, and are therefore easy of Comparison
and interchange.

It is not too much to say, and it is important that it should be said,
that the beauty, simplicity, and convenience of this system are not yet
fully understood and appreciated by many engineers who might be
greatly benefited by its use. Asa Single illustration, reference may be
made to the still very general use of the foot-pound as a unit of work
and energy. Let no one imagine that the objection to this unit lies in
the fact that units of the metric system are not used, for kilogram-
meter, which is also very common, is equally objectionable. The diffi-
culty rests in the introduction of a variable, and in this instance unnec-
essary magnitude, namely, the force of gravitation. If the funda-
mental units, foot, pound, and second, be used, we have a unit of work
sometimes called the ‘‘foot-poundal,” and if the centimeter, gram, sec-
ond system be used, we have the well-known “erg.” These units are
vastly more convenient in practical use than their gravitation relatives,
besides being invariable, whenever and wherever the units of length,
mass, and time are invariable.

Modern scientific metrology may be said to rest upon a few simple
prineiples which may be summarized as follows:

The number of independent fundamental units should be minimum.
In general not more than three are required.

They should be such as admit of a ready and accurate comparison
with other magnitudes of the same kind. Units of length, mass, and
time satisfy this requirement better than any other that can be selected.

They should be capable of use for such comparisons at places and
times widely separated; hence they ought to be comparatively easy of
re-production and transportation and, as far as human ingenuity can
secure, invariable in their magnitude. Units of length, mass, and time
satisfy these conditions better than any other.

They should also be so related to each other, as far as such relation
FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE. 139

is possible, and the multiples and sub-multiples should be so related to
them that units of every possible dimension and character for couven-
ience in the measurement of all measureable things may be derived
from them in the simplest manner, and thus be capable of the easiest
re-duction and interchange. The units of length, mass, and time, as
represented by the centimeter, the gram and the second, fulfill these
requirements almost as perfectly as possible. The second falls short
of the others because its multiples are not decimally derived, but its
use is and has long been so nearly universal that it is not likely to be
modified in that respect in the near future. Indeed, a decimal system
as applied to time is much less important than when considered in rela-
tion to length and mass.

As to the constancy of these units, an arbitrary length and an arbi-
trary mass are much more capable of accurate reproduction than any
natural units of which we now know. When reproduced in considera-
ble numbers and of the best known material, and when widely dis-
tributed throughout the civilized world as they now are, under the diree-
tion of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, anything
like destruction or loss of the standards must be regarded as well-nigh
impossible. Copied in materials of various kinds and preserved under
conditions widely varying, it is hardly likely that any secular change
in the standards can escape detection, and the accurate determination
of the meter in light waves now in progress will afford a valuable check
on the constancy of the standard of length.

It thus appears that the metric system with its derived units is to day
by far the most perfect system of metrology ever used by man, and
that it lacks little of theoretical perfection. It can hardly be denied
that in one or two matters of minor importance it is susceptible of
improvement, but it possesses the inestimable and unapproachable
advantage of being actually in use by the great majority of civilized
nations. Among the innumerable metrological schemes which have
made their appearance within the past one hundred years, it is quite
possible that some one of them possesses advantages over that based on
the meter and the kilogram, and that it would be preferred if we were
starting afresh with the whole question. But we are not starting
afresh, and it is certainly a cause for sincere and earnest congratula-
tion that a system which is so rapidly advancing in public favor is as
nearly absolutely perfect as is this.

Let us turn now to a brief consideration of the origin and present
condition of what Lord Kelvin has justly characterized as the brain-
wearying, intellect-destroying system of weights and measures in use
among English-speaking people.

The fundamental unit of length is the yard, and the unit of mass is
the pound. In the time of Edward IT it was enacted (A. D. 1324) that
3 barleycorns, round and dry, should make 1 inch and 12 inches make
1 foot. The earliest actual material standard yard of which there is
140 FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE.

reliable account dates back to the time of Henry VII (about A.D. 1490),
In the Transactions of the Royal Society it is recorded that in 1742
“some curious gentlemen, both of the Royal Society of London and of
the Royal Academy of Sciences at Paris, thinking it might be of good
use for the better comparing together the success of experiments made
in England and in France, proposed some time since that accurate
standards of the measures and weights of both nations, carefully exam-
ined and madeto agree with each other, might be laid up and preserved
in the archives both of the Royal Society here and of the Royal Academy
of Sciences at Paris,” and determined to bring about an exchange of
copies of the standards of weight and mass of the respective countries.
This led to an examination of the original standards of the exchequer
and their copies. It was found that the standard yard then in use was
a square rod of brass, of breadth and thickness of about half an inch.
The ends were neither exactly flat nor parallel. The standard was an
end measure and a matrix was provided for it. Near each end of the
yard was stamped a crowned E and it dated from about 1588.  Con-
sidered as a standard, its character was very inferior, but less so than
the old standard of King Henry VII, which was examined at the same
time. This is described as an “ old eight-sided rod of brass, of the thick-
ness of about half an inch, very coarsely made, and as rudely divided
into 3 feet, and one of these feet into inches.” This is the standard
which dates from A. D. 1490, and is the earliest known material yard.

In 1758, under instruction from a committee appointed by Parliament,
John Bird constructed copies of the then existing standards (Eliza-
bethan), one of which, a line measure, was recommended for adoption
as the legal standard of length. A copy of this was made by the same
artist in 1760, and is known as Bird’s standard of 1760, to distinguish
it from his first copies made in 1758. Although the subject received
much consideration during the next half century, it was not until 1824
that any action was actually taken by Parliament. It follows that up
to this date the legal standard of length in Great Britain and her colo-
mies continued to be the very imperfect standard of Elizabeth referred
to above. In 1824, however, it was finally enacted that Bird’s standard
of 1760 should be the fundamental unit of length, and in the same act
it was provided that in case of loss it should be reproduced by means
of its Supposed known ratio to the length of a seconds pendulum at
London. In 1834, the Parliament houses, in one of which this standard
had been preserved, were destroyed by fire. It is interesting to note
that the conflagration was due to the burning of the ‘ tallies” or sticks
on which accounts had been kept by means of notches, and in the use
of which the Government officials had persisted for many years after it
had almost become a lost art elsewhere, thus exhibiting a conservatism
characteristic of the whole course of the English Government in refer-
ence to metrology and allied sciences.

The legal standard having been destroyed in this manner, it was
FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE. 14

found impracticable to reproduce it, as had been intended, by the use
of a pendulum, and accordingly a new standard was prepared under
the direction of Mr. Sheepshanks from a half dozen excellent copies of
the destroyed standard which were available. This was legalized by
an act of Parliament in 1855, and is the imperial standard yard of Great
Britain to-day. It is a line measure, made of bronze, the total length
being 38 inches and the cross section 1 inch square. At the time it was
prepared several copies were produced, one of which, known as Bronze
No. 11, is in the U.S. officeof weights and measures at Washington.

To recur now to standards of length in the United States, it is
necessary to repeat the often-published statement that although the
Constitution authorizes Congress to establish a system of weights and
measures, it has never exercised this authority except in the matter of
legalizing the metric system in 1866. The weights and measures in use
in the colonies before the Revolution were almost entirely those of
Great Britain, and they continued in use without special legalization
for a long time after independence was declared. The first Superin-
tendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey, Mr. Hassler, requiring an
accurate standard of length in the operations of that Bureau, obtained
from Troughton, of London, in 1814, a brass bar about 82 inches long,
2-5 inches wide, and one-half inch thick. This bar was a direct descend-
ant of the Bird standard of 1760, a number of copies of which had
been made by Troughton.

It being necessary for the Executive Departments of the Government
to have some standards of weight and measure properly authenticated,
for the purpose of levying taxes, duties, ete., this bar, or rather one
particular yard of it, from the twenty-seventh to the sixty-third inch,
was adopted as the standard of length. It was supposed to be precisely
equal to the British standard at a temperature of 62° I. A direct
comparison with the copies of the new imperial yard of 1855, however,
showed that it was too long at that temperature, and this fact gave
rise to the idea which found its way into scientific literature that the
English and American yards were different, the latter being the longer.
The action taken in the office of weights and measures was simply to
change the temperature at which it was a standard, so as to bring it
into agreement with the English yard. As a matter of fact its use as a
standard was practically discontinued, and the bronze copy of the
imperial yard was accepted in its place, together with another copy of
this yard made of Low Moor iron and so designated.

It will thus be seen that, as far as the Government is concerned, we
have followed the English in the matter of standards of length, and
their yard and ours have always been as nearly as practicable iden-
tical.

The same is essentially true in regard to the standard of mass.
There is an important difference, however, in that Congress did, in
1828, legalize a standard Troy pound for purposes of coinage, This
142 FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE.

was a copy of the British Troy pound of 1758, which in 1825 became
the imperial standard. It is preserved in the mint at Philadelphia,
and is known as the mint pound. The standard avoirdupois pound of
the Treasury Department was derived from this Troy pound. Both are
very inferior in construction and unsuitable for standards. The pres-
ent imperial standard of mass of Great Britain is a platinum avoirdu-
pois pound. It was derived from a copy of the standard referred to
above, which was lost in the burning of the Parhament houses. As
the imperial standard and our own have thus a common ancestor, it is
assumed that they are the same.

Besides these units of length and mass the executive officers of the
Government adopted two units of volume, the gallon which contains
231 eubie inches and the bushel of 2150-42 cubic.inches. They are old
English measures and differ very materially from the imperial gallon
and bushel now in use in Great Britain.

The above statements apply to what may be known as national or
United States standards only iu the limited sense that they are the
standards of the executive branch of the Government. The whole
subject of standards, with the exception as to the metric system already
noted was, in the absence of definite action by Congress, left to the law-
making authorities of the several States. In view of the great and
intelligent interests in this subject exhibited by Washington, Jeffer-~
son, Adams, Gallatin, and others of the early statesmen, the omission
to legislate in Congress must be attributed largely to the fact of great
dissatisfaction with the present system and a hesitancy to recommend
any other, however perfect it might seem to be, until it had received
the test of actual trial. Realizing the danger which was impending of
inharmonious and unscientific legislation by the several States, Con-
eress decided in 1836 to encourage uniformity throughout the country
by the distribution among the various State governments of complete
sets of weights and measures copied from the standards adopted in the
United States office of weights and measures. Some States had already
legalized standards differing somewhat from these, but they were soon
accepted by all, thus establishing a practically uniform system through-
out the country and one in agreement with that adopted by the Gov-
ernment. Strictly speaking, however, each State has its own stand-
ards, and they are entirely independent of, although copied from, those
in use at Washington. But, as has already been explained, the latter
have not themselves been regarded as fundamental standards, being
only copies of the imperial standards of Great Britain, in the case of
the yard, or descended from the same ancestry, as in the case of the
pound, and assumed to be the same. It thus appears that practically,
and until a very recent period, our whole system of length and mass
measurement was made to depend upon the imperial yard and pound
of Great Britain.

The most important legislation upon this subject from the founding
FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE. 143

of the Government to the present time is the act of Congress of July
28, 1866, legalizing the metric system of weights and measures through-
out the United States. It has not been generally recognized that this
system is and has been for more than a quarter of a century the only
system whose use is made legal throughout the whole country by act
of Congress. Since the passage of this act there has been a decided
advance in the use of this system among all civilized nations. This
remarkable movement, in which the United States Government, through
annual contributions of money and diplomatic negotiations, has had a
large part, leaves no room for doubt that in the comparatively near
future all mankind will be in the fullest enjoyment of the great boon of
a single, universal system of weights and measures, and one as nearly
perfect in form and design as could well be expected.

The recognition of this fact has led to recent action on the part of the
oftice of weights and measures at Washington, which is of such impor-
tance as to justify the repetition bere of the words of Bulletin No. 26,
U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, April 5, 1893, in which it was first
announced.

FUNDAMENTAL STANDARDS OF LENGTH AND MASs.

‘While the Constitution of the United States authorizes Congress
to ‘fix the standard of weights and measures,’ this power has never
been definitely exercised, and but little legislation has been enacted
upon the subject. Washington regarded the matter of sufficient impor-
tance to justify a special reference to it in his first annual message to
Congress (January, 1790), and Jefferson, while Secretary of State, pre-
pared a report at the request of the House of Representatives, in which
he proposed (July, 1790) ‘to reduce every branch to the decimal ratio
already established for coins, and thus bring the calculation of the prin-
cipal affairs of life within the arithmetic of every man who can multiply
and divide.’ The consideration of the subject being again urged by
Washington, a committee of Congress reported in favor of Jefferson’s
plan, but no legislation tollowed. Inthe meantime the executive branch
of the Government found it necessary to procure standards for use in
the collection of revenue and other operations in which weights and
measures were required, and the Troughton 82-inch brass scale was
obtained for the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1814; a platinum kilo-
gram and meter, by Gallatin, in 1821; and a Troy pound from London
in 1827, also by Gallatin. In 1828 the latter was, by act of Congress,
made the standard of mass for the mint of the United States, and,
although totally unfit for such purpose, it has since remained the stand-
ard for coinage purposes.

“In 1830 the Secretary of the Treasury was directed to cause a com-
parison to be made of the standards of weight and measure used at
the principal custom-houses, as a result of which large discrepancies
were disclosed in the weights and measures in use. The Treasury
Department being obliged to execute the constitutional provision that
all duties, imposts, and excises shall be uniform throughout the United
States, adopted the Troughton scale as the standard of length; the
avoirdupois pound to be derived from the Troy pound of the mint, as
the unit of mass. At the same time the Department adopted the wine
gallon of 231 cubic inches for liquid measure and the Winchester bushel
144 FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE.

of 2150-42 eubie inches for dry measure. In 1836, the Secretary of the
Treasury was authorized to cause a complete set of all we eights and
measures, adopted as standards by the Department for the use of cus-
tom-houses and for other purposes, to be delivered to the governor of
each State in the Union for the use of the States, respectively, the
object being to encourage uniformity of weights and measures through-
out the Union. At this time several States had adopted standards
differing from those used in the Treasury Department, but after a time
these were rejected, and, finally, nearly all the States formally adopted
by act of legislature the standards which had been put in their hands
by the National Government. Thus a good degree of uniformity was
secured, although Congress had not adopted a standard of mass or of
length other than for coinage purposes as already described.

“The next, and in many respects ue most important, legislation
upon the subject was the act of July 28, 1866, making the use of the
metric system lawful throughout the Uaited States, and defining the
weights and measures in common use in terms of the units of this Sys-
tem. This was the first general legislation upon the subject, and the
metric system was thus the first and, thus far, the only system made
generally legal throughout the country.

“Tn 1875, an international metric convention was agreed upon by
seventeen governments, including the United States, at which it was
undertaken to establish and maintain at common expense a perma-
nent international bureau of weights and measures, the first object
of which should be the preparation of a new international standard
meter and a new international standard kilogram, copies of which
should be made for distribution among the contributing governments.
Since the organization of the bureau, the United States has regularly
contributed to its support, and in 1889 the copies of the new interna-
tional prototypes were ready for distribution. This was effeeted by
lot, and the United States received meters Nos. 21 and 27, and kilo-
grams Nos. 4 and 20. The meters and kilograms are made from the
same, material, which is an alloy of platinum with 10 per cent of irid-
ium.

“On January 2, 1890, the seals which had been placed on meter No.
27 and kilogram No, 20, at the International Bureau of Weights and
Measures, near Paris, were broken in the Cabinet room of the Execu-
tive Mansion by the President of the United States, in the presence of
the Secretary of State and the Secretary of the Treasury, together with
a number of invited guests. They were thus adopted as the national
prototype meter and kilogram.

“The Troughton seale, which in the early part of the century had
been tentativ ely adopted asa standard of length, has long been recog-
nized as quite unsuitable for such use, owing to its faulty construction
and the inferiority of its graduation. For many years, in standardizing
length measures, recourse to copies of the imperial yard of Great Brit-
ain had been necessary, and to the copies of the meter of the archives
in the office of weights and measures. The standard of mass orig-
inally selected was likewise unfit for use for similar reasons , and had
been practically ignored.

“The recent receipt of the very accurate copies of the international
metric standards, which are constructed in accord with the most
advanced conception of modern metrology, enables comparisons to be
made directly with those standards, as the equations of the national
prototypes are accurately known. It has seemed, therefore, that greater
Stability in weights and measures, as well as much higher accuracy in
FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE. 145

their comparison, can be secured by accepting the international proto-
types as the fundamental standards of length and mass. It was doubt-
less the intention of Congress that this should be done when the inter-
national metric convention was entered into in 1875; otherwise there
would be nothing gained from the annual contributions to its support
which the Government has constantly made. Such action will also
have the great advantage of putting us in direct relation in our weights
and measures with all civilized nations, most of which have adopted
the metric system for exclusive use. The practical effect upon our cus-
tomary weights and measures is, of course, nothing. The most care-

ful study of the relation of the yard and the meter has failed, thus far,

to show that the relation as defined by Congress in the act of 1866 is in
error. The pound as there defined, in its relation to the e kilogram, dif-
fers from the imperial pound of Great Britain by not more than 1 part
in 100,000, an error, if it be so called, which utterly vanishes in com-
parison with the allowances in all ordinary transactions. Only the
most refined scientific research will demand a closer approximation, and
in scientific work the kilogram itself is now universally used, both in
this country and in England.*

“In view of these facts, and the absence of any material normal
standards of customary weights and measures, the oftice of weights
and measures, with the approval of the Secretary of the Treasury, will
in the future regard the international prototype meter and kilogram
as fundamental ‘standar ds, and the customary units, the yard and the
pound, will be derived therefrom in accordance with the act of July 28,
1866. Indeed, this course has been practically forced upon this oftice
for several years, but it is considered desirable to make this formal
announcement for the information of all interested in the science of
metrology or in measurements of precision.

Asa result of this action, our fundamental units of length and mass
are now the new international prototype meter and kilogram preserved
by the International Bureau of Weights and Measures, near Paris, and
our metrology is in touch with that of the civilized world. This is the
second great step toward complete emancipation from the ‘ brain-
wearying, intellect-destroying” system with which we have so long been
burdened, and let us hope that the time is not far distant when the

by “bringing the calculation of the principal affairs of life within the
arithmetic of every man who can multiply and divide.”

None will be more benefited personally by this action, and none can
aid more effectually to hasten it, than the distinguished body to which
this paper is respectfully submitted. If any argument in its favor were
needed, it would be sufficient to cite the example of one department of
the great subject of engineering, namely, electrical engineering, which
is doubtless represented in some degree in this Congress. But, yester-
day a thing unknown, its beautifully simple units of measure and their
interrelations are as wings which have enabled it to outstrip those
that persist in carrying the dead weight of an unscientific and hope-
lessly bad system of metrology.

UNITS OF ELECTRICAL MEASURE.*

Within but little more than a decade practical applications of elec-
tricity have developed with a rapidity unparallelled in the history of
modern industries. Many millions of dollars of capital are now in-
vested in the manufacture of machinery and various devices for the
production and consumption of electricity. As it has now become
a commodity of trade, its measurement is a question of the highest
importance, both to the producer and consumer. Both the nomencla-
ture of electro-technics and the methods and instruments of measure
are exceptionally precise and satisfactory, but there has been lacking,
up to the present time, the very important and essential element of
fixed and invariable units of measure authoritatively adopted. Such
units have long been in use among scientific men, but the necessity for
the establishment and legalization of practical units for commercial
purposes became evident in the beginning of the recent enormous
development of the applications of electricity.

To meet this universally recognized want, conferences and congresses
of the leading electricians of the world have been held at occasional
intervals, the first being the Paris Congress of 1881. These assem-
blages have been international in their character, for it was wisely
determined in the beginning that the new units of measure should be
international and, indeed, universal in their application. It was con-
venient to make them so, and it was important to thus facilitate in-
ternational interchange of machinery, instruments, etc. The United
States was represented by official delegates in the Congress of 1881,
and also in subsequent Congresses in 1884.

The difficulty of the material representation of some of the units
of measure was so great at the time of holding these Congresses that
no satisfactory agreement as to all of them could be arrived at. Some
recommendations were made, but they at no time received the unani-
moussupport of thoseinterested and were admitted by all to be tentative
in their character. During the past few years the advance of knowl-

edge and experience among electricians was such as to indicate that
the time was ripe for the general adoption of the principal units of
electrical measure. An International Congress of Electricians. was
arranged for, to meet in Chicago, during the World’s Columbian Ex-
position of 1893. In this Congress the business of defining and naming
units of measure was left to what was known as the “Chamber of
Delegates,” a body composed of those only who had been officially
commissioned by their respective governments to act as members of
said Chamber. The United States, Great Britain, Germany, and
France were eachallowed five delegates in the Chamber. Other nations
were represented by three, two, and in some cases one. The princi-
pal nations of the world were represented by their leading electricians,
and the Chamber embraced many of the most distinguished living
representatives of physical science.

The delegates representing the United States have reported to the
honorable the Secretary of State, under date of November 6, 1893,
giving the names and definitions of the units of electrical measure as
unanimously recommended by the Chamber in a resolution as follows:

** Resolved, That the several governments represented by the dele-
gates of this International Congress of Electricians be, and they are
hereby, recommended to formally adopt as legal units of electrical
measure the following: As a unit of resistance, the international ohm,
which is based upon “the ohm equal to 10° units of resistance of the
Centimeter-Gramme-Second system of electro-magnetic units, and is
represented by the resistance offered to an unvarying electric current
by a column of mercury at the temperature of melting ice 14-452
grammes in mass, of a constant cross-sectional area and of the length

of 106.3 centimeters.

“As a unit of current, the international ampere, which is one-tenth of
the unit of current of the Cc. G. S. system of electro- magnetic units, and
which is represented sufticiently well for practical use by the unvarying
eumrrent which, when passed through a solution of nitrate of silver in
water, and in ac codrance with accompanying specifications,* deposits
silver at the rate of 0-001118 of a gramme wes second.

* In the folleeee ing specification ae a Hos voltameter means the arrangement
of apparatus by means of which an electric current is passed through a solution of
nitrate of silver in water. The silver voltameter measures the total electrical quan-
tity which has passed during the time of the experiment, and by noting this time,
the time average of the current, or if the current has been kept constant, the cur-
rent itself can be deduced.

In employing the silver voltameter to measure currents of about 1 ampere, the
following arrangements should be adopted:

The kathode on which the silver is to be deposited should take the form of a plat-
inum bowl, not less than 10 centimeters in diameter and from 4 to 5 centimeters in
depth.

The anode should be a plate of pure silver some 30 square centimeters in area and
2 or 3 millimeters in thickness.

This is supported horizontally in the liquid near the top of the solution by a plat-
inum wire passed through holes in the plate at opposite corners. To prevent the
disintegrated silver which is formed on the anode from falling on to the kathode,
148 FUNDAMENTAL UNITS OF MEASURE.

“Asa unit of electro-motive force, the international volt, which is the
electro-motive force that, steadily applied to a conductor whose
resistance is one international ohm, will produce a current of one
international ampere, and which is represented sufficiently well for
practical use by 422° of the electro-motive force between the poles or
electrodes of the voltaic cell known as Clark’s cell, at a temperature of
15° ©., and prepared in the manner described in the accompanying
specitication.*

“As a unit of quantity, the international coulomb, which is the quan-
tity of electricity transferred by a current of one international ampere
in one second.

“As a unit of capacity, the international farad, which is the capacity
of a condenser charged to a potential of one international volt by
one international coulomb of electricity.

“As aunit of work, the joule, which is equal to 107 units of work in
the ©. G. S. system, and which is represented sufficiently well for prac-
tical use by the energy expended in one second by an international
ampere in an international ohn.

“As a unit of power, the watt, which is equal to 107 units of power in
the c. G. 8S. system, and which is represented sufficiently well for prac-
tical use, by the work done at the rate of one joule per second.

“As the unit of induction, the henry, which is the induction in a cir-
cuit when the electro-motive force induced in this circuit is one inter-
national volt, while the inducing current varies at the rate of one
ampere per second.”

Besides the fact that the Congress in which this important and far-
reaching action was taken was held in the United States, our country
has been honored by the action of the Chamber of Delegates in placing
in the list of the illustrious names which are to be perpetuated in the
nomenclature of electricity that of our countryman, Joseph Henry, whose
splendid contributions to science, made about sixty years ago, have
only in recent years met with full recognition. For these and other
reasons it is extremely desirable that our Government should be among
the first, if not the first, to adopt the recommendations of the Chamber.
To make the use of these units obligatory in all parts of the country
will require an act of Congress, but in the absence of that, it is within
the power of the Secretary of the Treasury to approve their adoption
for use in all Departments of the Government. This indeed is pre-
cisely the course long ago followed in reference to the ordinary weights
and measures of commerce and trade. Congress has never enacted a
the anode should be wrapped round with pure filter paper, secured at the back with
sealing wax.

The liquid should consist of a neutral solution of pure silver nitrate, containing
about 15 parts by weight of the nitrate to 85 parts of water.

The resistance of the voltameter changes somewhat as the current passes. To
prevent these changes having too great an effect on the current, some resistance
besides that of the voltameter should be inserted in the circuit. The total metallic
resistance of the circuit should not be less than 10 ohms.

*A committee, consisting of Messrs. Helmholtz, Ayrton, and Carhart, was appointed
to prepare specifications for the Clark’s cell. ‘Their report has not yet been received.

law fixing the value of their units, but the Secretary of the Treasury
was authorized to establish and construct standards for use in the
various Departments of the Government. Uniformity has followed on
account of the universal adoption of these standards by the several
States.

The Government is itself a large consumer of electricity and electrical
machinery, and for its own protection it is important that units of
measure be adopted. With the approval, therefore, of the honorable
the Secretary of the Treasury, the formal adoption by the Office of
Standard Weights and Measures of the names and values of units of
electrical measure as given above, the same being in accord with the
recommendations of the International Congress of Electricians of 1895,
has been announced.

PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE COLORS OF NATURKE.*
By F. E. IvEs.

Heliochromy—meaning sun-coloring—has been settled upon as a
name for processes of photography in natural colors, or in the colors of
nature. There are two kinds of heliochromic processes. In one, the
light itself produces the colors by direct action upon the sensitive plate;
in the other, light does not produce colors, but is made to regulate their
distribution and combination. Some of the colors of the spectrum were
imperfectly re-produced by a process of the first kind nearly thirty years
before the discovery of the Daguerreotype pyocess. Seebeck, of Jena,
in 1810, found that chloride of silver, after preliminary exposure to
white light, is colored a brick-red by prolonged exposure to the red
light of the spectrum, and a metalic blue by the blue light. After the
discovery of the Daguerreotype process, several experimentalists tried
so to modify the preparation of the chloride of silver plates as to make
them capable of re-producing all the colors of nature. In a photographie
text-book published so long ago as 1853, I find the following statement:
“yen the long debated question of the re-production of the natural
colors by the agency of light seems on the point of solution. - -— -
M. Niepee de St. Victor, from whose well-known character as an exper-
imental philosopher much might be expected, has forwarded to London,
as we understand, specimens of proof in which every color is re-pro-
duced with a vigor and richness truly wonderful.” Similar announce-
ments have been made since that time, but the best results ever ac-
tually shown were nothing more than interesting curosities. Dr, W. H.
Vogel,} who recently had an opportunity to compare some of the latest
and most talked about of these “photographs in natural colors” with
the original colored pictures from which they were printed (by con
tact), says:

“The original is one of those transparent window pictures in bright
colors, brought into market by Grimme and Hembel, in Leipsic, as a

substitute for glass painting. It represents a cupid with yellowish-
brown hair and wings, and a small blue scarf around the waist, whose
ends wave in the wind. He earries an arrow piercing two hearts of
ruby color; between the knees he holds a quiver with yellow orna-
mented opening, and yellow mountings, the lower part of which rests,
with the figure, upon an idealistic thistle blossom of red leaves. The
stem is of the same color, and the plant shows fresh green leaves. The
picture has a pale blue background, and red, green, and yellow orna-
mentation around the border in very pronounced colors. This border
ornamentation affords an excellent means of comparison with the print.
The latter, in opposition to the bright original, shows a greenish-grey,
partly dark, ground. At first look, one recognizes readily that of all
the colors only the red of the original has been distinetly re-produced.
But it is not true to nature; it has a copper-red color, and differs
decidedly from the vermilion and carmine red of the original. Besides
this copper red, only the blue of the scarf and the mountings of
the cross-bow and quiver come out a very pale light blue, with no
natural resemblanee. The black lines of the border decoration appear
alongside of this as a violet-black. These are the tones which, to some
extent, have a similarity of color, but with the other colors it is not so
favorable. The yellow squares and green trapezoids of the border
decoration appear neither yellow nor green, but have a greyish-red
tone. The blue fields are not blue, but greenish grey, like the ground.
It is most singular that several parts are re-produced in red which
actually are not red, but brown-yellow, as, for instance, the hair, the
wings, the cross-bow, the thistle, ete. The green leaves in the print
show no fresh color, and the red leaves of the blossom and the body of
cupid show only apale fleshcolor, - - - Theresemblance of the new
photographie pictures to natural colors is, therefore, not very favorable.
Only two colors can be recognized distinetly in the copy, of which the
red is the best; in a less degree the blue, which is weaker as far as the
picture is concerned. The blue in the ornamentation around the border,
and all other colors, either have not been re-produced at all, or, are
entirely unlike the original. - - - If Leompare the sample before
me with the pictures I have seen in 1867 of Niepce de St. Victor,
Becquerel, and Dr. Zenker, I must confess that those much older pro-
ductions were richer in color, although the tones deviated likewise con-
siderably from the natural ones.”

According to Capt. Abney, the red end of the spectrum produces red
by promoting oxidation; the blue end, blue, by its reducing aetion.*
Prof. Mendolat says: “It may at first sight appear improbable that
the coincidence between the colors of the spectrum and the colors
of the impressed film is a mere accident; but although this is difficult
to believe, I venture to think that it is an accidental coincidence and
nothing more. - - - In the best specimens of these photo-chro-
matie spectra that I have seen, the colors were certainly nothing
more than approximations to the pure spectrum colors; and even in
these spectra some of the colored effect was due to the unaltered
ground-color of the film in regions where some particular color had
produced no action at all.”

PHOTOGRAPHY IN THE COLORS OF NATURE. 153

The progress by which such imperfect results have been obtained is
too slow to be applied sucessfully to camera photography, and the
results are not permanent.

In view of all these facts, it would appear that there is no scientific
basis for a belief that any material improvement can ever be made in
this process, and that all so-called progress along this line is a delu-
sion. It is true that some distinguished photographic writers continue
to regard every new modification of this old process, and every new
result of experiment with it, as another step towards the photographie
re-production of the natural colors; but I have no doubt that if the
same writers had lived two hundred years agothey would have regarded
the production of new yellow-colored metal alloys as steps toward the
transmutation of the baser metals into gold.

In my opinion, the first step toward the solution of this problem was
taken by Henry Collen, Queen Victoria’s painting master, who, in 1865,
invented a plan of composite heliochromy. His plan was based upon
a false conception of the nature of color, and means for carrying it out
were then unknown; but it was a bright idea, and contained the germ
of a suecessful process. Collen’s original communication of his idea
appeared in The British Journal of Photography, October 27, 1865, and
reads as follows

“Tt occurred to me this morning that if substances were discovered
sensitive only to the primary colors—that is, one substance to each
color—it would be possible to obtain photographs with the tints as in
nature by some such means as the following:

“ Obtain a negative sensitive to the blue rays only; obtain a second
negative sensitive to the red rays only, and a third sensitive to the yel-
low rays only.

“There will thus have been three plates obtained for printing in
colors, and each plate having extracted all its own peculiar color from
every part of the subject in which it has been combined with the other
two colors, and being in a certain degree analogous to the tones used
in chromo-lithogr aphy. Now, itis evident that if a surface be prepared
for a positive picture, sensitive to yellow rays only, and that the two
negatives, sensitive only to blue and r ed, be super-imposed either on the
other, and be laid on this surface, the ac tion of ight will be to give all
the yellow existing in the subject, and if this process be repeated on
other surfaces sensitive only to red or blue, respectively, there will
have been produced three pictures of a colored object, each of which
contains a primitive color reflected from that object.

“Now, supposing the first great object achieved, viz., the discovery
of substances or preparations, e each having sensitiveness to each of the
primary colors only, it will not be difficult to imagine that the nega-
tives being received on the surface of a material quite transparent and
extremely thin, and that being so obtained are used as above, 7. é., each
pair of superimposed negatives to obtain the color of the third—that
three positives will be obtained, each representing a considerable por-
tion of the form of the object, but only one primary of the decomposed
color of it. Now, if these three positives be received on the same kind
of material as that used for the negatives and be then laid the one on
the other, with true coincidence as to the form, and all laid upon a

white surface, it will not be difficult to imagine that the effect would
be not only the representation of the form of the object, but that of its
color also in all its compounds.

‘ Although the idea I have endeavored to express in words may be
utterly worthless, | am unwilling to let it slip away without notice, as
it may on the other hand contain a germ which may grow and bear
fruit in due season.”

The language of some parts of this communication is ambiguous, but,
taken altogether, with due allowance for the writer’s unfamiliarity with
photographic technology, it clearly amounts to a suggestion to make
three photographic negatives of an object—one by the action of red
light, one by yellow, one by blue; to print from each pair of these nega-
tives (superposed as one) a transparent positive having the color repre-
sented by the third negative, and to superpose on a white surface the
three prints thus obtained.

It was not possible to carry out Collen’s suggestion at that time,
because there was no known process by which plates could be prepared
which were sensitive to single colors only, and no photographie plates
were sensitive enough to red and yellow to admit of the production of
such negatives by exposure through selective color screens. Had _ it
been possible to carry it out, the results must have been very imperfect,
not only because the entire procedure is based upon a false and mislead-
ing theory of color, but also because superposing two negatives to act
as one would double the intensity of such parts as represented white,
gray, or pale colored objects, with the result that if the color prints
were made to show all the details of the negatives, the finished helio-
chromes would show all bright colors as if mixed with equal parts of
black pigment.

On November 23, 1868, Ducos Duhauron, of Paris, applied for a patent*
for a process which differed from Collen’s only in the manner of carry-
ing out the same idea. Like Collen, he eee that the spectrum is
made up of three-primary color rays and mixtures thereof. He said,
‘““ My procedure rests on the principle that the simple colors are limited
to three—the red, the yellow, and the blue—the combination of which
in divers proportions produces the infinite variety of shades in nature.”
