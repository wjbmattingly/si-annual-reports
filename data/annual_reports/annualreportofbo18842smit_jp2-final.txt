REPORT UPON THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE UNIPED
| STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM IN 1884.

G. BROWN GOODL, AssISTANT DIRECTOR.

S. Mis. 33, pt. 2——1 '
REPORT UPON THE CONDITION AND PROGRESS OF THE UNITED
STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM IN 1884.

A.—GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.
1. INTRODUCTORY REMARKS.

During the year the oflicers of the Museum have continued the work
of arranging the material under their charge in the exhibition halls,
laboratories, and store-rooms at their disposal.

It should be remembered that the reorganization of the Museum was
begun late in 1881, at the time when the new Museum building was first
made ready for occupation, and that 1884 is but the third year of sys-
tematic effort. Much progress has been made in removing from the
exhibition halls the great mass of unclassified material which had been
gathering for many years in the various store-rooms of the Smithsonian
building and elsewhere, and which, on account of lack of space, had for
the most part been allowed to remain in the original packing cases.

The floors of the Museum have at last been almost cleared, and at
present only three of the seventeen exhibition rooms are occupied for
storage purposes, viz: The southwest court, which is still full of speci-
mens belonging to the departments of metallurgy, mineralogy, and
lithology ; and the southeast court, which is used as a general recepta-
cle for empty cases and unmounted material belonging to the depart-
ments of zoology and anthropology. Before the end of February this
work will be completed.

The additions to the Museum have been far more numerous and val-
uable than in any previous year. The activity of every department
has been greater, both in respect to progress made in the administration
of the collections and in respect to the number of scientific papers pub-
lished by the officers in connection with their professional studies upon
the specimens under their charge.

By direction of Congress the Smithsonian Institution, in connection
with the Executive Departments of the Government and the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, has participated during the year in the industrial
expositions at Cincinnati, Louisville, and New Orleans.

Having been designated by yourself, and appointed by the President,
representative of the Smithsonian Institution (including the National
Museum and Fish Commission) on the Government Executive Board,

3
4. REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

eharged with the representation of the interests of the General Govern-
ment at these expositions, I have devoted the greater portion of my
time during the latter half of the year to the work of preparation, an
account of which will be given in fuller detail hereafter. Nearly every
department of the Museum has necessarily been called upon to assist in
this work, and a large proportion of the activity of the force has con-
sequently been diverted to this channel. Although the progress of
regular work has thereby suffered much interruption and delay, it is
hoped that the service will eventually be benefited and final organiza-
tion accelerated rather than impeded. At the present time the exposi-
tion at New Orleans is in progress, and the collections sent thither by
the Museum cover a space fully equal to one-third of the entire exhibi-
tion space in the Museum building in Washington.

In accordance with established custom, the exhibition work has been
carried on entirely under the direction of the regular Museum officers,
assisted by such additional workers as it was found practicable to en-
gage temporarily. Many of our officers accompanied the collections to
superintend their installation in the exposition building. Several of the
curators are at present absent in New Orleans and will be obliged
to return to that city at the close of the exhibition, in May, to attend to
the packing and return of the collections.

Following established usage, I have reviewed the work of the several
scientific departments of the Museum, as well as that of the division of
administration. The reports of the curators of the several departments
are presented in full, their extent and importance being so great as to
render this necessary. In my ownreport I have included an account of
the operations of the department of arts and industry, for the present
assigned to my care, in preference to preparing a special curator’s report
upon this department: the reports of certain of the curators of “sec-
tions” of this department are, however, furnished with the others.

In the present report, as in those which have preceded it, certain
suggestions relating to the administration of the Museum are made for
which I desire to be held individually responsible, and which the reader ~
should not assume to be definitely determined elements of the policy
of the Museum, since they may, any or all of them, at some future time,
either in their present forms or with modifications, be recommended for
adoption, or pronounced undesirable. .

This being the first of the separately printed series of Museum reports,
some statements which have already been printed in previous reports are
repeated, in an abridged form, for the purpose of presenting a general
exhibit of the policy of the Museum.

It had been the desire of myself and my associates to present in this the
first report of the new series a somewhat exhaustive statement of the
present condition of the Museum, together with a review of its past
history as a whole and of its several departments: the exigencies of
Exposition work having made this impossible, we hope to prepare such
a report for the coming year.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 5

2. THE FOUNDATION AND SCOPE OF THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Foundation and legal status —The National Museum was organized in
1846 by the act of Congress transferring to the Smithsonian Institution
the custody of the “‘ National Cabinet of Curiosities,” at that time de-
posited in the Patent Office building.* These collections were, in 1857,
placed in the Smithsonian building, the Regents of the Institution hav-
ing accepted the trust on condition that the necessary appropriations
for their maintenance should be continued by Congress.

The act above referred to provides that ‘all objects of art and of
foreign and curious research, and all objects of natural history, plants,
and geological and mineralogical specimens belonging or hereafter to
belong to the United States, which may be in the city of Washington,”
shall be delivered to the Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, and
together with new specimens obtained by exchange, donation, or other-
wise, shall be so arranged and classified as best to facilitate their
examination and study.t

The National Museum is the authorized place of deposit for all objects
of natural history, mineralogy, geology, archeology, ethnology, &c.,
belonging to the United States or collected by the Coast and Interior
Survey, the Geological Survey, or by any other parties for the Govern-
ment of the United States, when no longer needed for investigations in
progress.

Organization and government.—The establishment of the Smithsonian
Institution, to which, in addition to the carrying out of the other re-
quirements of the bequest of Smithson, is intrusted the control of the
National Museum, is composed of the President of the United States
and his Cabinet, the Commissioner of Patents, and a Board of Regents,
which has for its members the Vice-President and Chief Justice of the
United States, three members of the Senate, three members of the
House of Representatives, and six other persons, not members of Con-
gress, two of whom are residents of the city of Washington.§

The management of the National Museum is intrusted to the Secre-
tary of the Smithsonian Institution, who is, ex-officio, its director. He
is aided by a staff of assistants, who are chosen by him, and for whose
action he is responsible to the Regents. The constitution of the staff is
constantly changing with the varying needs of the Museum.

This staff is at the present time composed of an assistant director,
six curators and five assistant curators, twelve honorary curators, serv-
ing without pay, a number of aids, acting in various capacities, a reg-

istrar, chief taxidermist and chief modeler, besides a considerable force
of preparators, mechanics, watchman, clerks, laborers, We.

The collections are stored and exhibited in the building erected for
the use of the Smithsonian Institution between 1847 and 1857, and in
the new building, just finished, known as the ‘‘ National Museum.”

Composition of the collections.—The Museum is made up, in large part,
of the following materials: :

1. The natural-history and anthropological collections accumulated
since 1850 by the efforts of the officers and correspondents of the Smith-
sonian' Institution.

2. The collections of the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, the Perry
Expedition to Japan, and other naval expeditions.

3. The collections of the scientific officers of the Pacific Railroad
Survey, the Mexican Boundary Survey, and of the surveys carried on
by the Engineer Corps of the Army.

4, The collections of the United States Geological Surveys under the
direction of the United States Geologists Hayden, King, and Powell.

5. The collections of the United States Fish Commission.

6. The gifts by foreign Governments to the Museum or to the Presi-
dent and other public officers of the United States, who are forbidden
by law to receive them personally.

7. The collections nade by the United States to illustrate the animal
and mineral resources, the fisheries, and the ethnology of the native
races of the country, on the occasion of the International Exhibition at
Philadelphia in 1876, and the fishery collections displayed by the United
States in the International Fisheries Exhibition at Berlin in 1880 and
at London in 1883.

8. The collections given by the Governments of the several foreign
nations, thirty in number, which participated in the exhibition at Phil-
adelphia.

9. The industrial collections given by numerous manufacturing and
commercial houses of Hurope and America, at the time of the Philadel-
phia Exhibition and subsequently.

10. The material received, in exchange for duplicate specimens, from
the museums of Hurope, Asia, and Australasia, and from numerous in-
stitutions and collectors in North and South America.

Adjuncts to administration.—All necessary adjuncts to the work of
the Museum, a working library, a chemical laboratory, a photographic
establishment, a workshop for taxidermy, modeling, and the prepara-
tion of skeletons, and several smaller workshops are carried on as a part
of the general work of administration.

Publications of the Museum.—The scientifie results of the labors of the
officers of the Museum, and of investigations upon the collections be-
longing to it, are to be found for the most part in the following works;

sulletin of the United States National Museum ;

Proceedings of the United States National Museum ;
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, 7

Reports of the Smithsonian Institution ;

Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections ;

Smithsonian Contributions to Knowledge ;

Reports of the Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution ;

Reports of the United States Commissioner of lisheries ; .

Bulletin of the United States Fish Commission ;
also occasionally in other scientific reports of other scientific depart-
ments of the Government, especially those of the United States Geo-
logical Survey, many of whose oflicers are also honorary oflicials of the
Museum.

A catalogue of the scientific papers emanating each year from the
Museum or based upon Museum interests has been published cach year
since 1851 in the Sinithsonian Report.

3. THE FUNCTION AND AIMS OF THE MUSEUM.

Objects and methods of work.—The collections in the National Museum
are intended to exhibit the natural and industrial resources, primarily
of the- United States, and secondarily of those of the remainder of the
world, for purposes of comparison.

The activity of the Museum is exerted in three directions:

(a) The permanent preservation of objects already in its possession.

(b) The acquisition of new material.

(c) The utilization of material already in its possession, by its exhibi-
tion in the most instructive manner, and by the prosecution of and pub-
lication of scientific researches for which it forms the basis; by the dis-
tribution of properly-labcled duplicates of materials to colleges and
other educational institutions.

The preservation of material is accomplished by means of the vigilance
of the curators and the skill of the preparators.

New material is acquired (a), from the various Government surveys
and expeditions, in accordance with law; ()) by gift from individuals,
from other institutions, and from foreign governments; (¢) by exchange
for its duplicate specimens or publications; (d) by the efforts of officers
of the Museum, who make collections in connection with their regular
duties, or are detailed for special service of this nature; (e) by purchase
when appropriations are made by Congress for that purpose.

The treasures in the custody of the Museum are utilized to the world
by exhibiting them to the public, and by encouraging investigations on
the part of the officers of the Museum and other suitable persons, and
facilitating the publication of the results; also by the distribution to
other museums and educational institutions of duplicate specimens,
which have formed the basis of scientific investigation, these being
identified and labeled by the best authorities.

The Museum by these means fulfills a threefold function :

1. It is a museum of record, in which ave preserved the material foun-
dations of a very great number of scientific memoirs—the types of
8 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

numerous past investigations. This is especially the case with those
materials which have served as a foundation for the numerous govern-
mental reports upon the resources of the United States. Types of in-
vestigations made outside of the Museum are also incorporated.

2. It is a museum of research, by reason of the policy which aims to
make its contents serve as fully as possible as a stimulus to and a foun-
dation for the studies of scientific investigators. Research is a neces-
sary part of the work, in order that the collections may be properly
identified and arranged. Its officers are selected for their capacity as
investigators, as well as for their ability as custodians, and its treasures
are open to the use of any trustworthy student.

3. It is an educational museum of the broadest type, by reason of its
policy of iliustrating by specimens every group of natural objects and,
so far as it may prove practicable, such other colléctions as may be
found useful for the instruction of the public which are explained by
displaying descriptive labels adapted to the popular mind, and by its
policy of distributing its publications and its named series of duplicates.

4. THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MUSEUM IDEA.

Periods in the history of the Museum.—The history of the National Mu-
seum may be divided into three periods: First, that from the foundation
of the Smithsonian Institution to 1857, during which time specimens
were collected purely and solely to serve as materials for research, no
special efforts being made to exhibit them to the public or to utilize
them except as a foundation for scientific description and theory. See-
ond, the period from 1857, when the Institution assumed the custody of
the “National Cabinet of Curiosities,” to 1876. During this period the
Museum became a place of deposit for scientific material which had
already been studied, this material, so far as convenient, being exhib-
ited to the public, and, so far as practicable, made to serve an educa-
tional purpose. Third, the present period, beginning in the year 1876,
in which interval the Museum has entered more fully into the addi-
tional task of gathering collections and exhibiting them on account of
their value from an educational standpoint.

In the first period, the main object of the Museum was scientific re-
search; in the second, the establishment became a museum of record
as well as of research; while in the third period is growing up the
idea of public education. As soon as a judiciously selected series of
objects from the material already within the walls of the Museum can
be displayed properly to the Museum visitors, the National Museum of -
the United States will have commenced to fulfill all the demands which
are likely ever to be made upon it.

The three ideas of scientific research, record, and education, co-opera-
tive and mutually helpful as they are, are essential to the development
of any comprehensive and philosophically organized museum. Materials
are gathered together that they may serve as a basis for scientific
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 9

thought. Objects which have served as a foundation for scientific
study, or which, from their historical significance, are treasured up and
preserved from destruction that they may serve purposes of record—
permanent land-marks of the progress of the world in thought, in cul-
ture, or in industrial achievement—they are not only records of what
has been done in the past, but they constitute the most valuable of all
materials for future study. The museum of record, then, is not only an
accessory to the museum of research, but an adjunct which accom-
plishes similar and fully equal results in the same direction.

The contents of the museum of research and the museum of record,
if no other objects be sought save those already mentioned, might with-
out impropriety be stored away in vaults and cabinets, inaccessible to
any except the specialist. To give them their highest value, however,
they should be arranged in such a manner that hundreds of thousands
of people should profit by their examination instead of a very limited
number, and that they should afford a means of culture and instruction
to every person, young or old, who may have opportunity to visit the
place in which they are preserved.

It is much to be regretted that many specialists, intent chiefly upon
the study of certain scientific problems in which they individually are
absorbed, are disposed to neglect the claims of the educated public
to the enjoyment and instruction which museums afford. They do not
hesitate to say that scientific museums should be administered for the
benefit solely of persons engaged in research. At a recent meeting of
professional naturalists, an eminent investigator in natural science pub-
licly expressed his opposition to exhibiting certain scientific collections
to “the gaping clowns who form the majority of the visitors to our
museums.” Such a spirit defeats its own purposes, and such a remark
deserves no answer. The experience of Europe with its magnificent
educational museums and the history of the several expositions in the
United States should be quite sufficient to satisfy any one who has
studied the matter that the museum is an educational power even more
influential than the public library. 4

The venerable director of the South Kensington Museum, speaking
from an experience of thirty-five years, not only in his own establish-
ment, but in the work of building up the score of sister museums, now
under its wing, located in the various provincial towns of Great Britain,
remarked to the writer: ‘“ We educate our working people in the pub-
lic schools, give them a love for refined and beautiful objects, and
stimulate in them a desire for information. They leave school, go into
the pursuits of town life, and have no means provided for the gratifica-
tion of the tastes which they have been forced to acquire. It is as
much the duty of the government to provide them with museums and
libraries for their higher education as it is to establish schools for their
primary instruction,”
10 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

The educational musewm is Of comparatively recent origin, and may
be said to be one of the outgrowths of the modern industrial expo-
sition. The World’s Fair of London in 1851, the first of a long series
of international exhibitions, was utilized by the Government of Great
Britain as a starting-point for a number of national educational mu-
seums, the most perfect which have as yet been organized, and many
subsequent World’s Fairs have been taken advantage of in a similar
manner, so that nearly every civilized country now has a system of
public museums. ‘

One of the results of the Philadelphia Exhibition of 1876 was that
it made plain to the people of the United States the educational
importance of great museums. It suggested the thought that if so
much that is inspiring and instructive can be imparted by the exhibi-
tion of natural and manufactured objects gathered together, chiefly
with commercial ends in view on the part of the exhibitors, neces-
sarily somewhat unsystematically arranged and with little effort to-
ward labeling in an instruétive manner, an immense field is open for
educating the public by gathering together a selected series of sim-
ilar objects, wlich may be so classified and explained by means of
labels and guide-Looks that they shall impart a consistent and sys-
tematic idea of the resources of the world and of human achieve-
ment.

The United States has as yet no system of educational museums, al-
though there are several museums of limited scope, which have success-
fully carried out the educational idea in the arrangement of their ma-
terials; for instance, the American Museum of Natural History in New
York, the Museum of Comparative Zoology in Cambridge, the Museum
of the Peabody Academy of Sciences in Salem, the Philadelphia
Academy of Natural Sciences, the Boston Museum of Art, the Mciro-
politan Museum of Art in New York, the Pennsylvania Museum of In-
dustrial Art, the Peabody Museum of Archeology in Cambridge, the
Peabody Museum of Yale College, and the Boston Society of Natural
History.

The same remark applies with equal force to the museums of Eu-
rope. There are, however, institutions, like the Museum of Practical
Geology, the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons, the museums
at Bethnal Green and South Kensington, in London, the Museum of
Industrial Art at Berlin, the Ethnological Museum at Leipsic, the
National Museum of Germany at Nuremburg, the Bavarian National
Museum at Munich, and others, which have admirably carried out a
single idea, or a limited number of ideas, and which are marvelously
rich in material and arranged in a manner full of suggestiveness.

The museum now under the charge of the Smithsonian Institution
has, through the action of influences beyond the control of ifs manage-
ment, in fact by the terms of the act of Congress which authorizes its

existence, been made the depository of collections in every depart-
ment—geological, botanical, zoological, and anthropological—and its
work has of necessity been organized upon a very Comprehensive pian.

5. PRINCIPLES OF ARRANGEMENT OF COLLECTIONS DESIGNED FOR
PUBLIC EXHIBITION.

The majority of visitors to any museum go thither for amusement, or
actuated by praiseworthy curiosity. Many have no desire to gain in-
struction, and even if actuated by such a purpose, would fail to accom.
plish their object by a visit to an ordinary museum. This is due in
part to the fact that where so much duplicate material is exhibited the
really instructive objects are lost to view; that the objects in but few
museums are labeled in a really instructive manner; but is principally
because the objects exhibited are not of the kind best adapted to the
needs of the museum-visiting public. The visitors carry away only gen-
cral impressions of rooms full of glass cases containing animals, min-
erals, and “ curiosities,” gathered by travelers among uncivilized races.
Professor Huxley has defined a museum as “a consultative library of
objects,” and this definition, true enough in itself as a description of
the best ideal museums, is unfortunately too true a description of all.
Most collections are as useless and little instructive to great masses of
our people, who know not how to use them, as are our libraries of
consultation. The museum of research, since it is intended chiefly for
investigators, should be the consultative library. The educational mu-
seum should resemble a great encyclopedia rather than a library full of
learned volumes. Every library of importance, however, contains the
cyclopedias for the general reader and the monographs for the scholar,
The larger public museums may in like manner be adapted to the needs
of both student and general visitor.

To overcome the difficulties in the way of this adaptation many steps
must be taken which are not usual in museums. By far the most im-
portant of these is in the direction of thorough labeling.

An efficient educational museum, from one point of view, may be
deseribed as a collection of instructive labels, each illustrated by a well-
selected specimen.

There are many obstacles to the effort to build up a museum upon
this basis. Museums which exhibit only such objects as are in them-
selves beautiful or marvelous cannot fail to be attractive, no matter
how poorly the objects are arranged and labeled.

When, however, the objects depend for their interest upon the expla-
nations on the labels, and upon the manner in which they are placed,
relatively to each other, a responsibility a hundred-fold greater is en-
tailed upon the curators. The materials of such a museum may be com-
pared to piles of brick, stone, lumber, and architectural ornaments,
which by themselves possess little apparent interest, but which may by
thought and labor be combined into an imposing and useful edifice,
12 "REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

Principles of administration.—Certain cardinal principles may be
announced which should be considered in the arrangement of every
public museum: (1) every article exhibited should illustrate an idea,
and no two objects should be shown which illustrate the same idea in a
similar manner; (IL) the idea which any object is intended to illustrate
should be explained upon its label in such a manner that any intelli-
gent visitor, without previous special knowledge of the subject, may
be able to learn (a) why the object is shown, and (b) what lesson it is
intended to teach; (III) the objects should be so carefully classified
that their relations to each other may be recognized by the vigitor, so
that taken together, they shall suggest general conclusions; in the
formation of these conclusions he should be aided by certain general
or collective labels which relate to and describe groups of objects
in a manner similar to that in which the individual labels describe
separate articles; (IV) the labels, individual and collective, should be
supplemented by guide-books and manuals for special departments,
which shall contain, arranged systematically, all the information given
upon the labels, and which shall be illustrated by engravings of the
more important objects.*

Industrial museums, as a rule, exhibit only those articles which are
designed and constructed in the most sumptuous manner—the armor of

* The following general rules have been formulated :

1. No object will be placed on exhibition which is not of evident educational value,
and likely to interest and instruct a considerable percentage of the persons visiting
the Museum.

2. The exhibition of duplicate material is to be avoided, except in instances where
similar objects can be shown to advantage in different divisions of the Museum.

3. Each object will be placed in a case of the form best suited for its effective dis-
play, and the light, color of the background, &c., will be so adjusted as to show
it to best possible advantage, and with the least possible fatigue to the eyes of the
visitor.

4. Each object, or group of objects, will be accompanied by a large plainly printed
label, which will give a concise description of what is shown, an account of its origin
and uses, a synopsis of its history, and the name of the person or organization con-
tributing it to the Museum. The character of the Museum is such that any labels
which might suggest advertising for business purposes must be excluded. It will
be the policy of the Museum, however, to give prominence on each label to the name
of the person or business house from whom it has been received, provided that the
object is a gift to the Museum.

5. The objects will be grouped together in systematic order, and each case will be
provided with a general descriptive label. In the case of collective exhibits, the gen-
eral label may also give the name of the contributor.

_ 6. The specimens will be illustrated and supplemented by pictures, diagrams, books,
and maps, in such manner that the Museum may form an encyclopedia, the illustra-
tions for which are in the exhibition cases, the text in the labels.

7. Guide-book manuals of the different departments will be published, which will
embody in concise and systematic form the information given by the specimen labels,
together with such illustrative material as may seem necessary to present in addi-
tion.

kings and knights, the furniture of palaces, the most artistic of metal
work, stone work, and wood work. The ethnological museums, on the
other hand, admit only the implements and costumes of savage and
partially civilized races. Between the two there is a great chasm to
be filled. It is as important to preserve in museums the more humble
and simple objects which illustrate the domestic economy and customs
of the masses of the people of civilized nations, as to search for similar
objects in distant lands, or to treasure up only the objects which, on
account of their cost, are seen and used only by the most wealthy and
luxurious classes in the civilized community.

Collections of this character are, perhaps, as well entitled to be called
“anthropological collections” as those usually included under this
name, which are intentionally more limited in their scope.

To supply the place of objects too large to be placed in a museum, too
evanescent to have been preserved, or which, on account of their rarity
or neglect in preserving them at the time when they could have been
obtained, are necessarily lacking in the collections, it is essential that
museums should assume the administration of great quantities of mate-
rial such as is usually consigned to the library or to the picture-gallery.
Otherwise, deficiencies in groups of objects, ‘which should illustrate by
their collective meaning a general idea, will much impair their value.
Pictures and diagrams should be freely used as temporary or permanent
substitutes for specimens which may be lacking, and also to supple-
ment and explain the descriptive labels. In many sections it may be
impossible to exhibit anything but pictures. It is needless to point out
the difference in the influence of a series of plates, like those, for in-
stance, in Audsley and Bowes “ Keramic Art in Japan,” the publica-
tions of the Arundel Society, the autotypes of Braun, or the illustrations
of many ethnographic works, if displayed in a public museum, where
they are seen daily by thousands of visitors, or hidden except from the
initiated few in a library, where they are only practically accessible to
students with abundance of time and training in the use of books.

Much of the material usually shown in art galleries and art museums,
such as is ordinarily used to illustrate the history of art, or is preserved
on account of its artistic suggestions, may be displayed in a much more
instructive manner in a museum without in the least lessening its value
to the artist or designer. Portraits, pictures of buildings, of costumes,
of geological features in scenery, of ceremonies, and of social customs
may be arranged and administered as anthropological specimens. In
addition, much may be accomplished by having standard works, re-
lating to the special departments of the museum, placed in convenient
places in the exhibition halls, and, if necessary, fastened to desks in

such a manner that they could not be removed, while easily accessible

to any person who might wish to become informed upon special topies
relating to objects being examined,
14 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.
6. SYSTEMS OF CLASSIFICATION.

The chief requisite to success in the development of any museum is
a thoroughly available plan of organization and a philosophical system
of classification.

The arrangement of the natural-history collections—zoological, botan-
ical, and geological—which will doubtless always constitute a very
large proportion of the treasures of the National Museum, and which
will undoubtedly in the future, as at the present, occupy the atten-
tion of at least three-fourths, if not more, of the Museum staff, is a
simple matter, since naturalists are pretty generally in accord as to the
affinities of different groups to one another, and since the grouping of
the objects in the Museum cases may be made to accord very closely
with the schemes laid down by systematists. When, however, it is
necessary to take up the arrangement of collections which illustrate the
history of human eulture, the lack of a convenient and instructive sys-
tem becomes very apparent.

Much thought has been devoted to these subjects by the officers of
the Museum, especially during the past four years. Many of the prin-
cipal museums of Europe-have been studied, their catalogues and pub-
lications minutely compared, and correspondence carried on with their
officers. It is hoped that the plans which have been developed as the
result of these labors may include the best features of similar plans
hitherto proposed, but it is undoubtedly true that no plans can be laid
down, except in a tentative way, since the experience of cach year re-
veals possibilities and impossibilities not previously thought of by the
student of museum methods. .

In my first report, published in 1881, I printed a scheme of classifi-
‘ation for the anthropological collections which, in certain quarters, did
not meet with favor. It was a purely tentative effort, published for the
purpose of inviting criticism, and not in any way supported by official
sanction. Some of the criticisms which it called forth were evidently
just and will have due weight in planning for future work. The scheme
referred to has been objected to by museum administrators because
it breaks up their favorite and time-honored method of geograph-
ical arrangement. It is the result of the experience of the oflicers of
this Museum that it is absolutely impossible to handle our immense
collections if we adhere to the methods of older and smaller establish-
ments. It is well known that some ethnological collections should be
arranged geographically, some teleologically, some with reference to
materials of which the objects are made.

In this Museum in different departments of the work we shall doubt-
less find it convenient to employ all these systems.

Our collections are at present being arranged in accordance with a
teleological rather than geographical plan of classification, objects of a
similar nature being placed side by side, musical instruments together,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. lo

weapons together, &c., and arranged in such a manner as to show the
progress of each idea from the most primitive type. In discarding the
ethnographic method of arrangement, however, special care has been
taken not to sacrifice the possibility of bringing together the objects
belonging to any particular locality or race, if this shall at any time
be required for purposes. of study.

In our method of installation, objects are mounted in glass-covered
trays or deep frames, 24 by 30 inches in dimension, which are arranged
’ for study or exhibition in cases of various forms. The articles belong-
ing to two different tribes are never mounted together in the same tray;
and if at any time it should be found desirable to bring together the
collections from any given race, for instance, from the Eskimos, the
Siamese, or the Japanese, this might be accomplished in a few hours ;
in fact, when once the present system of mounting has been completed,
the rearrangement of the Museum upon the ordinary ethnographic plan
would be the work of only a few hours, and may be effected by a small
force of mechanics and laborers under the direction of a single curator.

It is no part of the plan, nor has it ever been, to separate articles
which belong together. The parts of any collection or group of objects
which may justly be considered a unit of administration are always kept
together; for instance, if a costume is complete it is not intended to
dissect it and distribute its parts. The separate elements of a costume
are only placed by themselves when they have no related objects asso-
ciated with them. In the same way a costume of a family, whether com-
posed of two or ten individual suits, might with propriety be regarded
as a unit. Collections illustrating the history of a special tribe in a
monographie way may also with propriety be kept tagether. Sucha
collection would, however, not be assigned to the department of art and
industry, where the preferred method of arrangement is evolutionary
or progressive, but would rather be made over to the department of
ethnology. F

The studies of the collections already made by Professor Mason, the
new curator of Ethnology, reveal the fact that there is really no con-
flict between a systematic scheme classification and a geographical one,
because, in those series of objects which have already been arranged,
the one scheme has always proved to be explanatory of the other.
They are mutually beneficial; indeed, it is impossible to understand the
one without studying the other.

B.—THE MUSEUM STAFF.

The staff of the Museum as now organized consists of two classes of
workers—the scientific officers, and the administrative officers; the
former reporting to the Director of the Museum, the latter to the As-
sistant Director, who also has general supervision of the administra-
tive work of the curators.
LG es REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

7. THE SCIENTIFIC STAFF.

In the scientific staff of the Museum there are at present nineteen
curatorships, some of which are subdivided below, so that the number
of heads of departments and sub-departments is twenty-five, and the
total number of menin the scientific staff thirty-six, of whom twenty-
four are in the pay of the Museum, and the others honorary, five being
detailed for this duty by the Director of the United States Geological
Survey, one by the Director of the Bureau of Ethnology, others by the
United States Commissioner of Fisheries, and by the Secretary of the
Navy, while two are volunteers. It may be stated here that the de-
tails just referred to are in every instance made in the interests of
co-operation with those Government bureaus engaged in work closely
connected with that of the Museum. The paleontologists of the Geo-
logical Survey find itso much to their advantage to have access to
the paleontological collections of the Museum and the use of the
laboratories, storage cases, and general administrative machinery, that *
they are permitted by their chief to assume the responsibilities of cura-
torships and perform a general work of supervision; and the mineralo-
gists and the curator of aboriginal pottery are similarly situated. In
nearly every instance, however, the Museum supplies the honorary -
curators with assistants, who relieve them of much of the routine work.

The curatorships are now organized as follows:

DIVISION OF ANTHROPOLOGY.

Department I.—Arts and industries, the Assistant Director acting as
curator (A. Howard Clark, assistant, two preparators), with subeurator-
ships as follows:

(a) Materia Medica. Dr. H. G. Beyer, U. 8. N., honorary curator,
with one clerk.

(b) Textile Industries. Romyn Hitchcock, acting curator.

(c) Fisheries. R. Edward Earll, curator.

(d) Animal Products. R. Edward Earll, acting curator.

(e) Naval Arcbitecture. Capt. J. W. Collins, United States Fish Com-
mission, honorary curator.

(f) Foods. W.O. Atwater, acting curator.

(g) Historical Relics.

In this department, it may be stated, is administered very much of
the material, such as is usually arranged by museums in their ethno-
logical series, and the Curator of Ethnology is consequently acting as
adjunct curator in the Department of Arts and Industries.

Department IT.—Ethnology. Dr. Otis T. Mason, curator, with one
preparator and two clerks.

Department ITI (A).—Antiquities. Dr. Charles Rau, curator, I. P.
Upham, assistant.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 17

Department ITT ().—Aimerican Prehistoric Pottery. W. H. Holmes,
Bureau of Ethnology, honorary curator, Dr. {bdward Foreman, assistant,

one preparator.
DIVISION OF ZOOLOGY.

Department TV.—Mammals. Frederick W. True, curator, one clerk,
two preparators.

Department V (A).—Birds. Robert Ridgway, curator, Leonhard
Stejneger, assistant, one clerk and one preparator.

Department V (B).—Birds’ Hggs. Capt. Charles Bendire, U.S. A.,
honorary curator (volunteer), and one clerk.

Department VI.—Reptiles and Batrachians. Dr. H. C. Yarrow, hon-
orary curator (volunteer).

Department VII. Fishes. Dr. T. H. Bean, curator, two assistants

' detailed from the United States Fish Commission.
Department VIII.—Comparative Anatomy. Frederick W. True, cura-
_ tor, F. A. Lucas, assistant, and one preparator.

Department ILX.—Mollusks. W. H. Dall, curator, R. E. C. Stearns,
adjunct curator, both of U. 8. Geological Survey, one clerk.

Department X.—Insects. Prof. C. V. Riley, honorary curator (vol-
unteer).

Department XI.—Marine Invertebrates. Richard Rathbun, U. S.
Fish Commission, curator, one assistant, and one clerk detailed from
the United States Fish Commission.

Department XIT (A).—Invertebrate Fossils, Paleozoic. C.D. Walcott,
United States Geological Survey, honorary curator.

Department XIT (B).—Invertebrate Fossils, Mesozoic and Cenozoic.

, Dr. C. A. White, United States Geological Survey, honorary curator,
J. B. Marcou, United States Geological Survey, honorary assistant, one
clerk.

DIVISION OF BOTANY.

Department XIII.—Fossil and Recent Plants.—Lester F. Ward,

United States Geological Survey, honorary curator, one clerk, one pre-

parator.
DIVISION OF GEOLOGY.

Department XIV.—Mineralogy. Dr. F. W. Clarke, United States
Geological Survey, honorary curator, W. 8S. Yeates, assistant.

Department X V.—Lithology and Physical Geology. George P. Mer-
rill, acting curator, one preparator.

Department XVI.—Metallurgy and Economie Geology. Fred. P.
Dewey, curator.

A comparison of the above classification with that presented in the re-
ports for 1883 willshow changes in the following particulars, namely, that
the scope of the Department of Arts and Industries has been augmented
during the year by the addition of two sections: (1) Naval Architecture,
of which Capt. J. W. Collins is the honorary curator, and (2) Animal
9

18 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

Preducts, in charge of R. Edward Earll, as acting: curator. Mr. Earll
has also been acting as curator of the section of Fisheries. For greater
convenience the section of Foods and Textiles has been reorganized in
two divisions: (1) Textile Industries, Mr. Romyn Hitchcock as acting
curator, and (2) Foods, under the direction of Prof. W. O. Atwater.

To the Division of Anthropology has been added the Department of
American Aboriginal Pottery, under the honorary supervision of Mr.
W. H. Holmes, of the Bureau of Ethnology. The Department of
Ethnology has been organized under the curatorslip of Prof. Otis T.
Mason, taking the place of the Department of Races of Men in the
classification as given in the report for last year.

The Division of Zoology has been increased by the addition of (1)
the Department’ of Birds’ Eggs, Capt. Charles Bendire, U.S. A.,
serving, as honorary curator; and (2) the Department of Compara-
tive Anatomy under Mr. F. W. True, assisted by Mr, F. A. Lucas.
The three Departments of Crustaceans, Worms, and Radiates and Pro
tozoans, as classified in 1883, have been merged in one, the Department
of Marine Invertebrates, under Mr. Richard Rathbun. Department
XVI, Physical Geology, under the old classification, is now an adjunct
of the Department (XV) of Lithology under the direction of Mr. George
P. Merrill; and the Department of Mineralogy, which was in 1883 con-
nected with that of Lithology, is now Classified separately.

8 THE ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF.

The classification of the departments in the Division of Administra-
tion remains essentially the same as detailed in the report for last year,
and is as- follows:

Department A.—Direction. This department is tinder the immediate
charge of the Assistant Director, who, as executive officer to the Di-
rector, has general supervision of the routine work in all the depart-
ments, the care of the installation of specimens, the construction of
cases, &c., the purchase of supplies, &c., the assignment of work and of
apartments, leaves of absence, curators’ reports, and routine correspond-
ence. The organization of the offices of the Director and Assistant
Director has not been materially changed during the year, except that,
on account of the increase in efficiency of the other departments of the
Division of Administration, a considerable amount of routine work, with
its accompanying responsibilities, has been transferred from the Assist-
ant Director to the heads of these departments. During the absence of
the Assistant Director for five weeks during the summer, on business
connected with the preparation of the Smithsonian exhibit at the World’s
Exposition in New Orleans, Mr. F. W. True was designated to act in his
place. Mr. hi. J. Geare, executive clerk, has rendered most efficient
service in the Assistant Director’s ottice,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 19

Department B.—Registry and storage. This department is in charge
of Mr. 8. C. Brown, whose duties pertain to the reception, unpacking,
and assignment of accessions and other packages, the packing and ship-
ment of boxes, &c., the storage of accessious subject to the call of cura-
tors, and the custody of department catalogue books.

Department C.—Archives. Mr. 8. C. Brown also has charge of all
papers relating to accessions and the distribution of Museum materiai.

Department D.—Library. Mr. F. W. True, librarian.

Department H.—Publication. Dr. Tarleton H. Bean performs the
duties of editor of “* Proceedings” and “ Bulletins.”

Department ’.—WLabels. My. A. Howard Clark in charge. His duties
consist in the arrangement of material for labels, in receiving the printed
labels from the printer, and in arranging a duplicate set of labels for
reference.

Department G.—Duplicates and exchanges. Mr. 8. C. Brown in
charge. The work of this department includes the distribution of du-
plicate collections for exchange and the custody of the files relating to
applications and proposals for exchange.

Department H.—Property and supplies. Mr. C. W. Schuermann in
charge. All cases, furniture, and supplies of all kinds are under his
care, and are distributed by order of the Assistant Director.

Department I.—Accounts. <All disbursements are made by the Dis-
bursing Clerk of the Department of the Interior. Estimates for sup-
plies and the general care of contracts and orders are included in the
work of this department.

Department K.—Buildings and labor. Mr. Henry Horan, superin-
tendent, in charge. In this department are included the care of police
and inspection, mechanics and labor, construction and repairs, clean-
ing and, public comfort, heating and lighting.

Department [.—Electric service. In this department are embraced
the telephone service, time service, burglar-alarm service, and watch-
clock service.

Department M.—Preparation. This department is divided into sev-
eral sections, each of which is in charge of a preparator, and is thor-
oughly discussed in another portion of this report.

Haposition staff—In addition to the regular administrative staff of the
Museum, an administrative staff for exhibition work has been maintained
since July, 1352, under the general charge of the Assistant Director.
Mr. Rk. Edward Earll is the executive officer, and Mr. W. V. Cox finan-
cial clerk of the staff, which is increased from time to time as occasion
requires by the employment of extra clerks and preparators, and to
which also, when necessary, are detailed various officers of the Museum
scientific staff. In addition to the exhibition work of the year else-
where referred to, this staff is still engaged in the preparation of a re-
port upon the International Pisheries Exhibition at London, in 1883,
20 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

C.—THE CONDITION OF THE COLLECTIONS.

The custodianship of the specimens of the several departmeifts has
been conscientiously fulfilled by the curators with the assistance of the
various preparators. Jam confident that the material in the possession
of the Museum has never been in better condition than itis at the
present time.

10. ASSIGNMENT OF SPACE,

There has been made no material change in the assignment of exhi-
bition space, as described on page 2 of my report for 1883. The north-
west court will probably be opened during 1885 with the collections of
North American pottery. The exhibition space for the collections of
the metallurgical department will shortly be increased by the opening
of the southwest court.

In the Smithsonian building the four main halls are occupied as they
were in 1883, and as follows: Main hall, Ornithology; upper main

*These estimates do not take into account the actual number of specimens, but
refer to ‘‘lots” of specimens, which may include one or several punaren but which
are included in a single entry of the Museum register,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. Fi

hall, Pre-historie Archeology; west range, Ichthyology; west hall, In-
vertebrates. ;

The south galleries of the Smithsonian main hall have been cleared,
the exhibition cases, which were old and unserviceable, having been

. taken down and used for other purposes, and the gallery spaces assigned

for laboratory use. The southwest gallery is now occupied by the
ornithological department for a work-room, and for storage of the great
collection of unmounted bird-skins; the southeast gallery is similarly
occupied by the conchological department.

The large room adjoining the northeast pavilion in the Museum
building is now used as a depository for the oological collection, and as
a laboratory for the section of birds’ eggs.

The office of the Director of the Geological Survey having been re-
moved elsewhere, the northeast pavilion is now occupied by the chemi-
eal and physical laboratory of the Survey. The southwest pavilion is
being fitted up for the accommodation of the mammal, metallurgical, and
mineralogical laboratories; the west balcony is used as a laboratory for
ethnology; the north balcony for the department of textiles, and the
south baleony for plants, recent and fossil.

The photographer of the Geological Survey having vacated the rooms
for several years occupied by him in the brick annex, second story, the
workshop of the taxidermist attached to the department of birds has
been transferred thither.

The Armory building, with its wooden annex, occupied jointly by the
Museum and the Fish Commission, is still crowded with unassorted
material belonging to the Museum collections.

In order to provide suitable accommodations for the preparators, in
connection with the preparation of the exhibit for the three expositions
of Cincinnati, Louisville, and New Orleans, and also to give much-needed
space for packing the collections to be sent, it was deemed advisable
to construct a wooden building east of the Museum building. On July
15 the work of breaking and leveling the ground was commenced. The
annex is 15) feet long, 50 feet wide, and 50 feet high. The eastern
end was assigned to the modeling department of the United States
Geological Survey. The southwestern portion was occupied by the tax-
idermic force of the National Museum, and in the northwest part the
packing and general exposition work was carried on. The cost of this
annex was about $3,500, expended as follows:

for the New Orleans Exposition, were erected in July between the Mu-
seum and the Annex building.

The need of an additional Museum building is each year more se-
riously appreciated. Very many objects of great interest and requir-
ing a large space for their accommodation have been promised by ex- |
hibitors at New Orleans, and it is a serious problem to know where
these can even be stored, aside from the possibility of properly display-
ing them.

Extensive collections of alcoholic specimens are known to greatly
endanger the safety of museum buildings and their contents, and most
of the establishments in Europe have lately taken the precaution to
construct separate buildings peculiarly adapted for the purpose. It is
sincerely hoped that the application which was made at the last session
of Congress for an appropriation to put up a similar building in the
grounds of the Institution will be acted upon favorably.

D.—REVIEW OF THE ADMINISTRATIVE WORK OF THE
YEAR.

11. ACCESSIONS TO THE MUSEUM.

The total number of packages recorded by the registrar during the
year was 5,507. In addition to this number, 209 wagon-loads of boxes,
packages, &¢., were received and distributed to the several depart-
ments. Of the entire number, 3,509 packages, boxes, &c., were ad-
dressed to the National Museum and its officers, the remainder being
intended for the Smithsonian Institution and the United States Fish
Commission.

The registrar of the Museum acts also in the capacity of transporta-
tion clerk for the Smithsonian Institution, and much material passes —
through his hands with which this report has no concern. The total
number of individuals and institutions sending collections to the Mu-
seum, as shown in the list published in the appendix to this report, is
a 084.

It should be stated that very many of the objects sent in by the
correspondents of the Museum are of very little value, and are trans-
mitted simply for the purpose of obtaining a report upon their names
and character. It has been the policy of the Smithsonian Institution
to receive all objects offered which have any relation to its work, since
the majority of such contributions, after they have been identified and
studied, are valuable for exchange or distribution to museums and in-
stitutions of learning, and often prove to be of unexpected importance.
Many of the specimens sent in for examination and report are entirely
useless. It is hardly proper, therefore, to consider each one of the 3,500
packages received as constituting an important contribution to the col-
lections. Many of thefa, however, contain specimens of great value,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 23

The Museum has, during the past year as in previous years, received

accessions from the following sources :

(a) By gift from correspondents.

(b) By exchange with institutions at home and abroad.

(c) By the deposit of the collections of the various surveys and Goy-
ernment departments which here find their legal repository.

(d) From the work in connection with the several expeditions.

(e) As a result of the explorations carried on under the patronage or
with the co-operation of the Smithsonian Institution and Museum.

Mr. John Durand has rendered efficient service in negotiating ex-
changes with European museums.

Every important accession is fully described in the reports of the sev-
eral scientific departments.

12. PROGRESS IN CLASSIFICAT#0ON AND ARRANGEMENT.
(a) Laboratory work and catalogue entries.

By “laboratory work” is meant the work of the curators upon the col- —
lections in their special apartments, which are not open to the public.
Here the collections are received, unpacked, classified, identified, and
catalogued ; here also it is determined whether specimens should be
placed in the exhibition series; or, if not thus assigned, whether or not
they are sufficiently important as material for investigation in the study
Series, or should be called “duplicates” and distributed to other insti-
tutions.

The efficiency of the Museum work depends, in a large degree, upon
the facilities which are afforded to curators for careful and thorough work
in the laboratories. It is here that the specimens are indelibly marked
with the catalogue number, upon which all future authentications de-
pend. Here also must be prepared the labels, upon which the value
of the exhibition series to a great extent depends; and here are prose-
cuted the scientific investigations, which, through the publications of
the Museum, establish the reputation of its scientific staff for thorough
and accurate work. The laboratory accommodations are being im-
proved, but still there is much to be desired in respect to space, number
of clerical assistants, and facilities for the use of books and instru-
ments and other appliances.

In a museum, as in a temporary exposition, the efficiency of each
department depends also upon the energy and constant presence of a
thoroughly competent head, and consequently upon the opportunities
afforded him for good work in his laboratory.

The present organization of the Museum is of such recent date that
nearly all the curators are still embarrassed by the accumulations of
past years, and the greater portion of their time is necessarily devoted
to unpacking and overhauling the unelassified material which they
found already on hand when they assumed the duties of their present
ofiices. These heritages from the past will soon be under control, and
24 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

it may be expected that our next year’s report will show a great increase —
in the amount of work directly concerned with the preparation of the
exhibition series, of final labels, of catalogues and hand-books, and the
prosecution and publicrtion of original researches.

The activity of 1884 may best be gauged by the following table, which
shows the total number of entries made in the Museum registers of the

(b) Development of the exhibition and study series.

The “ reserve series” in the Museum includes all the specimens which
are retained for purposes of study, the exhibition series consisting of
objects which are suitable to be exposed to public view in glass cases,
selected from the reserve series of which it forms.a part. The study
series is formed by the residue, which are kept compactly stored either in
cases in the laboratories or in the closed tables which serve as pedestals
for the smaller show-cases in the exhibition halls.

The study series for any special group may generally be largely re-
duced in extent after an exhaustive monograph has been published
upon that group, it being the long-established policy of the Museum to
reserve only a sufficient number of specimens to permit the author of
such monograph to entirely rewrite it, should the manuscript of his
essay be destroyed.

Much progress has been made during the year in ‘many departments
in the work of separating the duplicate from the reserve series, and
in many of the others in the work of preliminary classification, which
is the necessary preparation for this task. The development of the
exhibition series is necessarily slow, since it is not considered desir-
able to place on exhibition specimens which are not fully explained by
printed labels. It is, to be sure, often necessary to expose to view
large objects which have not been labeled. The extent and nature of the
work of the Museum is not appreciated by persons who are not familiar
with the character of the laboratory work and who have not access to
the reserve stores. In the various departments of ethnology and indus-
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. “25

trial art, for instance, the wealth of the Museum is exceedingly great,
but until cases have been built and labels printed it is impossible prop-
erly to display it.

Although very much has been done for the development of the exhi-
bition and study series, it is certain that during the years 1885 and 1886
the Museum will improve in attractiveness to the visitor and general
student, and in convenience to the investigator and special student, to
a degree which has not in past years been in any way approximated.

The exhibition series has been greatly extended during the year by
the work which has been done for the several expositions, numerous
specimens having been mounted and labeled, which after. their return
may be placed at once on exhibition. Many objects have been acquired
especially for use in this exposition work, which are equally desirable
for the regular exhibition work of the Museum.

During this year, special improvements have been noted in the exhi-
bition halls devoted to mineralogy, lithology and physical geology,
metallurgy and economic geology, textile industries, fisheries, and na-
val architecture.

(ce) Construction of cases.

It is hardly necessary to remark that no part of the work of the Mu-
seum at present occupies so much of my attention as the construction of
cases, since the supply at present on hand is far from adequate to our
needs. The “furniture and fixtures appropriation ” which Congress has
made annually since 1880 permits each year the building of a large
number of cases. At the same time the capacity of the Museum build-
ing, with its laboratories and work-rooms, is exceedingly great, and up
to the present time certainly not more than one-half of the requisite
amount of case room has been obtained. In my previous report was
given a statement of the number of cases in the Museum at the begin-
ning of the year 1883. Appended is a list of the cases added during
the year 1884:*

The names by which these cases are designated will of course be un-
intelligible to those who are not familiar with the nomenclature adopted
inthe Museum. Our system of case construction, which has been briefly
discussed in previous reports, is entirely different from that in use in
any similar establishment, and is admitted to be unusually economical
and effective. We are constantly called upon by the officers of other
museums for descriptions and working drawings. I have in prepara-
tion, and hope to present in the report for 1885, a full description, with
illustrations, of the various methods of installation which have been
adopted. .

The main features of the plan are as follows: The cases are, as a rule,
of mahogany, finished in the natural color, and have been constructed
in accordance with artistic plans furnished by Mr. William Bruce Gray.
Their chief recommendations are the following: (1) the building con-
sisting practically of a single large hall; the cases are so constructed
that they may placed between any two adjacent pilasters, and thus
form partitions dividing this hall into seventeen halls of lesser ex-
tent; (2) the cases are all of one length, 8 feet 8 inches,* which is the
architectural unit of the Museum building, or are of such lengths that,
combined together, they always conform to this unit, so that they are
interchangeable ; (3) the construction is such that, with very slight ex-
penditure of labor, any one of them full of specimens can be transported
from one part of the building to another, thus allowing great freedom
in the matter of rearranging the Museum; (4) all the smaller specimens
are mounted in groups upon small tablets or in glass-covered boxes of
uniform size, which can be handled with great facility, and which afford
great security to the specimens, and diminish immensely the labor of
properly caring for them; (5) the objects are displayed against back-
grounds which at the same time afford the greatest ease to the eye of
the visitor and the greatest relief and effectiveness to the object dis-

played ; (6) the objects being shown singly against a suitable back-
ground, and at the same time brought as close as possible to the glass
front of the case, the sense of confusion, so often experienced in mu-
seums, is entirely avoided; (7) the labels are printed in large, heavy-
face type and upon paper of soft tints, which are much less wearisome
to the eye than the ordinary labels in black and white.

Important additions of storage cases and furniture have been made to
the laboratories of several of the curators, and all the laboratories are
now better supplied than ever before. The storage cases in some of
these departments are built in four sections in height, occupying only
the same floor space as the one-section cases and accommodating four
times the quantity of specimens. Each curator is supplied with a light
ladder, affording easy access to the upper sections.

The laboratories in which the greatest improvements have been made
during the year are those of birds, fishes, mollusks, insects, invertebrate
fossils, fossil plants, lithology and physical geology, minerals, and met-
allurgy and economic geology. The following statement shows the
pumber and kind of storage cases and other furniture at present in use
in the various laboratories

(ad) Preparation of labels.

During the year 1884 about 4,500 descriptive labels for the exhibition
series were printed, besides several thousand forms of labels for the
reserve and duplicate collections in the various departments. This has
been accomplished through the courtesy and co-operation of the Secre-
tary of the Interior. Much progress has been made toward labeling
the exhibition series, particularly in the departments of Building Stones
and Materia Medica, the labeling of collections in those departments
being now practically completed. Many of the labels printed were for
the objects sent to the expositions.

Nochanges were made in the general form of the labels. Slight mod-
ifications were in some cases necessary, in order to adapt the labels to
special collections.

Large general labels, as also labels for some speci ial collections, are
printed upon a small press kept for the purpose ,in my office, while the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 29

bulk of the descriptive labels are, as a rule, printed by the Interior De-
partment. During the year 1884, however, the Museum office printed
about 2,000 labels, or nearly one-half of all that were printed. ‘These
were chiefly labels for the collections sent to the expositions.

Of each descriptive label there are twenty copies printed, ten on
cardboard (gray or herbarium) and ten on white paper; the former to be
shown with the objects and for the reserve file, and the latter for mak-
ing catalogues of the collections and for general Gistribution to donors
and to other museums. The labels printed for the Fisheries collections
which were sent to the London Exhibition in 1883 have been reprinted
in Bulletin 27 of the Museum, and form a complete index to the numer-
ous objects of fishing implements and vessel models composing the col-
lections.

The care of the labels requires the entire time of one man. AS soon

as received from the printer, a sample of each label is put in the scrap-
book series, as many as are needed for immediate use are sent to the cu-
rator in charge of the collections, and the remainder of the labels are
filed in unit drawers, where they are arranged numerically by depart-
ments. An index is kept, by means of which a label, designated by its
number, can be referred to at once in the scrap-book and files.

13. PROGRESS OF GENERAL AND INCIDENTAL WORK.
(a) Library.

During the past year the usefulness of the library has been gradu-
ally increasing, although no very important additions have been re-
ceived. The additions for the year numbered about 700 books and
pamphlets, including many works of permanent value and practical
utility. Few purchases have been made, the principal sources of growth
being through exchange, gift, and deposit. The various departments
of the Government, especiaJly those engaged in scientific research, have
made many valuable contributions. The trustees of the British Mu-
seum have presented a large series of the catalogues and regular pub-
lications of that institution. Progress has been made during the year
in the effort to classify systematically the books in the library, but the
work has been greatly retarded owing to the insufficient force. The
classification referred to is absolutely necessary for the proper admin-
istration of the library, and it is hoped that it may soon be practicable
to provide adequate means for this purpose.

The library system may be briefly described, as follows: In the cen-
tral library are retained all books treating of more than one subject,
such as periodicals, proceedings of societies, serial reports, dictionaries,
and cyclopedias, together with such monographs as are not desired in the
sectional libraries, which are in the several Museum laboratories under _
the charge of their respective curators. To the sectional libraries are
assigned only those works which relate directly to the work of the see-
30 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

tion. Books ia the sectional libraries are considered to be personally
loaned to the curators in charge.

All books and other matters are first entered at the central library,
and the necessary acknowledgment made, after which monographic
works, upon application, are sent to the sectional libraries, their assign-
ment being designated upon the card catalogue.

It is very evident that the efficiency of the curators, not only in the
proper handling of the collections, but also in the preparation of the
scientific reports, which constitute so prominent a feature in the work
of the Museum, depends upon the completeness of the Museum Library.
A certain sum should be set aside for the purchase of books, since many
of those which are most needful cannot be obtained by exchange. The
entire appropriation has hitherto been needed for the payment of sala-

ries and the construction of cases, and for all books which have been

bought the Museum is indebted to the Smithsonian endowment fund.
(b) Distribution of duplicates and exchanges.

The following table represents the number of boxes and packages of
specimens distributed to museums and colleges, and in exchange with
correspondents during the year, viz:

The number of specimens contained in these boxes and packages
amounts to 21,084. This table shows an increase in the work of this
department, there having been distributed this year nearly 5,000 speci-
mens more than in 1883.

During the year, 103 applications from museums, schools, and indi-
viduals in the United States for general natural history specimens have
been filed, and a large number of these have been filled.

The number of packages of all kinds shipped to the New Orleans,
Louisville, and Cincinnati Expositions amounted to 819.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 31

In the report of the Department of Marine Invertebrates will be
found a detailed list of the institutions to which the Fish Commission
sets of duplicates of marine invertebrates were distributed during the
year. References to the various exchanges made are also reported on
by the several curators. <A tabulated exhibit of what the Museum has
done in the way of distributing its duplicates from the commencement
of its history is very desirable, and will probably be prepared in time
for the next report.

(c) Publications.

A complete list of the publications of the National Museum for 1884
is given in Appendix B, Part IV. During the year the last five signa-
tures of Vol. VI and the first thirty-one signatures of Vol. VII ap-
peared. Proceedings United States National Museum for 1583, Vol.
VI, consisting of 558 pages and 14 plates, were published.

Bulletin No. 25, including seven parts, and forming Vol. I of Contribu-
tions to the Natural History of the Bermudas, and Bulletin No. 27, con-
sisting of twelve parts and constituting a report upon the exhibit of the
United States at the London Fisheries Exhibition, 1883, were printed.

Hight Museum circulars were printed as separates. These, including
Nos. 24-31, will appear in Vol. VIII, Proceedings United States National
Museum.

In Appendix B, Part [V,will be found a bibliographical list of the
papers published during 1854 by ofticers of the Museum. These papers

(d) Visitors.

During the year the number of visitors to the Museum building has
been 195,322, and to the Smithsonian building 91,130. The total num-
ber of visitors may, therefore, confidently be placed at considerably
more than 200,000.

It may be noted that the interest of visitors in the collections appears
to be increasing in full proportion to the progress which has been made
in affixing descriptive labels.

The doorkeepers still continue the use of the automatic registers,
which are proving much more satisfactory than the turnstile system
usually employed in museums and exhibitions. The result of their
record is given below in tabulated form.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 33

e) Students and lectures.

Reference has been made in previous reports to the arrangement by
which, at the request of the Navy Department, the Institution received
for three successive years six ensigns, and assigned them to duty in
various sections of the National Museum for the purpose of enabling
them to become acquainted with certain branches of science, such as
chemistry, mineralogy, geology, ethnology, general natural history, &c.,
in order that in their subsequent cruises they might be more useful.
Three details of the kind have been made, none, however, in 1884, the
Department having found it inexpedient to continue the arrangement.
Most of the gentlemen already detailed have also been reclaimed and
assigned to duty. Two of these ensigns, Messrs. Miner and Garrett,
are now on the Fish Commission steamer “Albatross.” Ensign Hayden
was detached in October and ordered to duty, first at the Cambridge
Observatory, and subsequently to the United States Geological Survey.

The experiment in connection with these junior officers of the Navy
has been very satisfactory as far as it has gone, and there can be no
doubt that the increased range of information thus acquired by the
eighteen gentlemen so detailed will be utilized to a considerable extent
in the future.

The Museum is frequently favored by visits of men of science from
other countries for the purpose of special inquiry into its methods, and
an unusual number of such callers was welcomed during the past year
in connection with a meeting of the British Association in Montreal.
Several distinguished naturalists took the occasion to study the col-
lections of the National Museum, which they found to contain many im-
portant types otherwise inaccessible to them.

Permission has been granted during the year to a considerable num-
ber of students of art to make copies of specimens in the Museum, and
an increase in the number of schools visiting the Museum in company
with their teachers has been noticeable.

As in previous years, the use of the lecture room in the Museum on
Saturday afternoon during the winter and spring has been granted to
a joint committee of the Biological and Anthropological Societies of
Washington for the purpose of conducting a course of scientific lectures.
These lectures are usually in some way connected with the work of the
Museum, and are illustrated by specimens from the collections. They
correspond in character closely to the afternoon lectures given at the
gardens of the Zoological Society of London.

The programme of the year is here appended:

(f) Meetings of societies.

The lecture hall of the National Museum has been used during the
year for sixty-eight meetings of different kinds, as is shown below.

National Academy of Sciences, April 15-17: Ten meetings were held.
On the evening of the 17th a public meeting was held, at which the
eulogies of deceased members were pronounced, 176 persons being in
attendance.

American Surgical Association, April 30-May 3: Hight meetings were
held.

American Fish Cultural Association, May 13-15: Seven meetings
were held. Invitations were extended by the Commissioner of Fisheries
to the fish commissioners of nineteen States, and a large attendance was
the result. Many papers were presented, but the chief point of attrac-
tion was the opening to the public of the fisheries section of the Museum,
as arranged after the return of a part of the collection from the Inter-
national Fisheries Exhibition in London. The Brush-Swan Company
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR, 35

kindly furnished the lights to illuminate the entire building, especially
the fisheries section, and a large number of visitors were present on the
occasion. On the evening of May 13 a public meeting took place, Hon.
Elbridge G. Lapham in the chair. The formal address was delivered by
Hon. Theodore Lyman, of Massachusetts, who was followed by Hon.
S. S. Cox, of New York, in a second address.

American Dental Association, July 22-23: Four meetings were held.
‘ Society of American Taxidermists, July 80: One meeting was held.

Society of, Naturalists of the Eastern United States, December 29-
30: Four meetings were held.

The Biological Society of Washington: Fortnightly meetings were
held between June 25 and May 31, and between November 1 and De-
cember 27. In all there were fifteen meetings.

The Entomological Society of Washington held three meetings in
the office of the assistant director, on May 8, June 3, and November 3,
respectively.

On January 11, permission was granted to members of the Argent
Club, an association of amateur photographers, to hold their monthly
meetings in the photographic laboratory of the Museum.

14. CURRENT ADMINISTRATIVE WORK.

(a) Buildings and labor, police and public comfort.

At the commencement of the year the administrative staff for police
-and inspection consisted of Henry Horan, superintendent of buildings,
2 assistant superintendents, 12 watchmen, and 5 doorkeepers; for con-
struction, care of buildings, and repairs, 8 carpenters, 3 painters, and
1 mason; for Jabor and cleaning, 20 laborers, 2 attendants, and 4 clean-
ers. For heating and lighting there were employed 1 engineer and 4
firemen. The same system of Museum messenger-service as was adopted
in 1883 is still in practice, and greatly facilitates the despatch of busi-
ness between the offices of the divisions of administration and the offi-
cers and employés of the Museum. Two Museum messengers are now
employed, it having been found impracticable for one to complete the
round of the buildings within the necessary limit of time—one hour.

The following abstract of the report of Mr. Horan, the superintend-
ent of buildings, is here presented, to give an idea of the maniier in
which the mechanics and laborers have been employed. The main
features of the work mentioned by him and discussed elsewhere in this
report form the standpoint of the general administration :

In the early part of January the exhibits of metals, ores, &c., transferred to the
Smithsonian Institution at the end of the Centennial Exhibition in 1876 were brought
into the Museum and assigned to their respective departments.

A great many heavy specimens were brought into the New Museum from the Smith-
sonian building during the early part of the year, including the Egyptian statuary,
a pair of Haviland vases which were exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition, &c.
Much time was also occupied during the first part of the year in shipping to their
owners exhibits which had been sent to London in conjunction with the exhibit of
36 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

the National Museum. For instance, seventeen boxes were returned to the Signal
Office, fifteen boxes to the Light-House Board, &c.

Toward the end of January it was found necessary to add to the force two carpen-
ters, two painters, four laborers, and one fireman. In February and April farther
additions were rendered necessary.

During the latter month two additional carpenters, one painter, one stone- arate,
and ten laborers were employed. On account of lack of convenient quarters, it was
found necessary in April to clear out a portion of the southeast court for the use of
painters. The extra force was discharged on May 21.

On the 14th of May the entire force of laborers was very busily engaged in making
preparations for the opening of the fisheries section, which took place in the evening
of that date. It had been necessary for several days previous to keep the men at
work until midnight, and it was only by most strenuous efforts that the fisheries hall
was ready for the visitors a minute or two before the appointed time.

On the 10th of July the work of preparation for the Louisville and Cincinnati Ex-
positions was commenced. Three extra carpenters were employed. On this day the
construction of a workshop was begun in the grounds east of the Museum building
for the use of the stone-cutters, and a few days later the ground was broken for the
erection of an annex building, it having been found that the preparations for these
expositions demanded more space than could possibly be found in the Museum build-
ing. This annex was finished on August 4, and the taxidermist’s laboratory was im-
mediately removed to it from the Museum building. A portion of the annex was
alloted to the Bureau of Ethnology. On the 5th of August all the ethnological speci-
meus in the northeast court were taken to the new building.

On August 6 the work of packing the Louisville exhibits was commenced in the
northeast court, and on August 12 two car-loads, containing 112 packages, were shipped
to the exposition. On the following day the superintendent left Washington for
Louisville for the purpose of assisting in the reception and arrangement of the ex-
hibits.

On August 26 two car-loads of exhibits, numbering 76 packages, were shipped to
the Cincinnati Exposition, and the superintendent was also requested to go there
and render similar assistance. During this month the force of laborers and mechanics
was kept unusually busy, and at the end-of the month the extra hands were all dis-
charged.

On the first of September a small frame building was erected east of the stone-cut-
ters’ house for the purpose of poisoning skins, &c.

In the middle of October the National Museum received from the Botanical Gar-
dens some very fine tropical plants, which have been placed around the fountain in
the rotunda. Smaller plants were also arranged on the four balconies overlooking
the rotunda. These plants have added very much to the appearance of the Museum.

On November 24 the work of shipping the exhibits intended for the New Orleans
Exposition was commenced. On the 30th the superintendent left for New Orleans,
in order to help in the arrangement of specimens.

The preparation of the exhibit for New Orleans necessitated a large addition to
the force of mechanics and laborers, and during July 31 names were added to this
roll, distributed as follows: 4 carpenters, 1 painter, 4 masons, 10 laborers, and 12
aids, assigned to various departments for special duty. In August this force was in-
creased by 4 painters, 1 brass finisher, 1 laborer, and several aids.

During the absence of the superintendent at Cincinnati, Louisville, and New
Orleans, Mr. C. P. Crandell acted in his place. On account of sickness Mr. Crandell
was forced to temporarily resign his duties, and Mr. C. A. Steuart was then placed
in charge.

(b) Hlectric service.

There have been no important additions to this service during the
year, and a statement of the electrical apparatus now in use in the
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 37

National Museum will be found under this heading in the report for
1883.

The Superintendent of the United States Naval Observatory has in-

cluded the Smithsonian building and that of the National Museum in
the series of public establishments which receive telegraphic time at
noon on each successive day, and a clock, fitted up under the direction
of the Observatory, with an arrangement by which the Observatory
itself corrects any aberration in time, has been supplied. The money
expense has been borne by the Institution, but no charge has been
made for the time service.
- Through the courtesy of Colonel Rockwell, Superintendent of Public
Buildings and Grounds, connection has been made with the underground
telephone laid by his authority through the public grounds by the War-
ing Company. A special advantage in this was the opportunity of
making a more satisfactory connection between the National Museum
building and the United States carp ponds, a service that previously
had been much interrupted. Connection was also made through the
same trench with the Fire Alarm Telegraph Company, and the neces-
sary permission to open North B street was promptly granted by the
District Commissioners.

(c) Property and supplies.

The property clerk has, as hitherto, been in charge of and held re-
sponsible for all articles of furniture, and, in general, all Museum sup-
plies, and has been required to inspect the same and report upon them
to the Assistant Director. It is also his duty to keep in hand a stock
of such articles as are in most general use, issuing the same to any per-
son who presents a requisition duly endorsed. He is also required, when
necessary, to buy special articles, whose purchase has been duly ap-
proved.

It is the duty of the property clerk to see that in the purchase of
goods two points are especially attended to, viz: quality and price. If
the cost of an article will probably exceed $10, the property clerk is
required to obtain estimates from several reliable dealers.

(d) Accounts.

Owing to the continued ill-health of Mr. George S. Hobbs, who had
been in charge of this department, it was found necessary to relieve
him of official duties, and on July 13 Mr. H. W. Spoftord was engaged
to fill his place temporarily, and also to assist Mr. William V. Cox, who
was acting as financial clerk on the special exposition staff.

The administration of the Museum accounts has been carried on, as
heretofore, under the direction of the chief clerk of the Smithsonian
Institution, and all payments have been made through his office. A
statement of the receipts and expenditures of the Museum will be found,
as usual, in the report of the executive committee of the Board of Re-
geuts of the Smithsonian Institution.
38 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.
(e) Chemical analysis of the air in the lecture room.

On several occasions it has been remarked that the air in the lecture
room became exceedingly oppressive during the progress of meetings,
lectures, &c. In order to verify these statements, Dr. J. H. Kidder, of
the United States Fish Commission, was requested by Professor Baird
to analyze the air during the progress of some of the Saturday afternoon
lectures. Dr. Kidder’s notes are here given in full :

The lecture began at 3.30 and continued for three-quarters of an hour;
most of the audience were present for a full hour. Its number, as es-
timated by the superintendent, was about 500. The hall had been
scrubbed and ventilated as well as possible (but very imperfectly) dur-
ing the day, and the screens freshly painted.

Out-door air was damp and cold, slightly below the freezing point.
Air of lecture hall, at 9 feet from the floor, about the middle of the hall,
was as follows:

Carbon dioxvide.—Highty-six feet of rubber hose, one-quarter inch in-
side diameter, were washed for two hours by a continuous stream of tap
water and strung upon the gas fixtures from a point 8 feet from the
floor, near the center of the hall, to the uppermost room of the north-
west tower. Air was pumped by aspiration through this tube from the
hall, and after the residual air in the tube had been displaced, was col-
lected in close bottles and examined, with the following results:

The last estimation was intended to eliminate errors arising from im-
purities possibly derived from the long and narrow tube through which
the air was collected. Since the out-door air in the afternoon has been
found by numerous estimations not to vary materially from the normal
average of 4 parts per 10,000, the correction due to the tube becomes
1.14, and the corrected results are as follows:

If the hall had been an absolutely closed box, the increase in carbon
dioxide due to the presence of 500 persons would have been about 300
cubie feet. The quantity observed (supposing the specimen to have
been a fair sample of all the air in the hall) was 45 cubic feet, or about
one-sixth of the possible increase.

Specimens were also taken for estimation of organic matter and other
contents of the air, but are not to be depended upon as tests because of
the length and narrow caliber of the collecting tube; since both solids
suspended in the air and ammonia tend to adhere to surfaces, and par-
ticularly to moist surfaces.

So far as carbon dioxide can be accepted as an indication of contam-
ination in air, these observations do not show an unwholesome condi-
tion of the air of the lecture room, but do indicate insufficient ventila-
tion. For exact conclusions, specimens should be taken near the floor,
near the ceiling, and about ten feet from the floor, at the beginning and
end of the lecture, and compared with one another and with the outside
air. Larger pipes, of metal, should be used for collection, unless speci-
mens can be taken in the hall itself; and estimations of ammonia, both
free and “ albuminoid,” should be made in addition to those of carbon
dioxide.

Persons present declared the air to be more oppressive than on March
1, but the figures show no material difference.* The highest essential
impurity (as measured by carbon. dioxide) appeared on March 6, when
there was no lecture, and it is probable that if there had been a lecture
on that day the highest figures for contamination by respiration would
then have appeared.

Summarizing the several observations, they result as follows:

March 1. Temperature increased 4° F. during the lecture.

March 1. Relative humidity increased 11 per cent. during the lecture.
(Floors had been wet before lecture.)
March 6. Temperature increased 4° during four hours in lecture hall.
March 6. Relative humidity increased 7 per cent. during four hours.
(No lecture.)
March 8. Temperature increased 5° during lecture.
March 8. Relative humidity increased 6 per cent. during lecture.
March 1, CO, exceeded outside air 3.53 per 10,000 before lecture.
March 1, CO, exceeded outside air 7.08 per 10,000 middle of lecture.

March 6, CO, exceeded outside air 5.44 per 10,000 at1 p.m. (No lect-
ure.)

March 8, CO, exceeded outside air 5.086 per 10,000 before lecture.

March 8, CO, exceeded outside air 8.505 per 10,000 near end of lecture.

If this excess be all attributed to respiratory impurity, it has exceeded
“the maximum amount of respiratory impurity permissible in a prop-
erly ventilated space” (Dr. Chaumont), viz, 2 parts per 10,000, by—

The increase due to respiratory impurity on the two lecture days of
experiment, while the lecture continued, was:

March 1. In half an hour, 3.55 parts per 10,000.

March 8. In three-fourths of an hour, 3.419 parts per 10,000.

* In the increase of CO, during the lecture.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 41

The indication is that the ventilation is imperfect, not only during
the lecture, but in the Museum generally, the permanent air showing
at all times of examination too great an excess of CO, over that out of
doors.

15. THE WORK OF THE MUSEUM PREPARATORS.

A number of additional preparators have been employed during the
year, for special work upon the collections for the New Orleans Exposi-
tion, and an unusual quantity of objects for the exhibition series have
been completed during the year in the workshops, as is shown in the
review of the operations of the scientific departments.

(a) Taxidermists.

The main workshop, which is devoted chiefly to work upon the mam-
mals, is under the direction of Mr. William T, Hornaday, chief taxider-
mist, and the general excellence of its work testifies to the efficiency of
its staff. The preparation of the exhibit for the New Orleans Exposi-
tion added considerably to its work, and during the summer:83 speci-
mens, representing 78 species, were mounted specially for the exposition.

During the year Mr. Hornaday and his assistants mounted 114 speci-
mens, representing 91 species, and classified as follows:

In addition to the work already specified, the skins of 57 mammals
were removed and preserved. <A collection of Australian fishes, con-
sisting of 60 specimens, was repaired and repainted. Twelve fur-seals
were repaired, and 24 large mammals were mounted on new pedestals.
The large seal group, which had been sent to the Fisheries Exhibition
in London in 1883, was reconstructed, and the collection of Ungulates
renovated. Twenty-one specimens of birds, fishes, &c., were mounted,
and two groups of small mammals made and set up.

DY an omission in the records of last year the Museum failed to make
acknowledgment to Mr. Hornaday for his gift of a mounted setter,
valued at $250, and to certain members of the Society of American
Taxidermists for some 25 objects presented to the National Museum.

position.

Mr. Henry Marshall has been engaged upon his regular work—that
of mounting birds—during the whole year. A large number were pre-
pared for the New Orleans, Louisville, and Cincinnati Expositions. In
his work he has had the valuable assistance of his son, Mr. George
Marshall.

(b) Osteological preparator.

Mr. Lucas has devoted his time, under the direction of the curator
of mammals, to the removal of the collection of mounted skeletons from
the Smithsonian building and its arrangement in the east south range
of the New Museum building. The two large whale skeletons have
been suspended from the ceiling, and nearly one hundred skeletons,
skulls, and other osteological specimens mounted and placed on exhibi-
tion. A large number of specimens have been cleaned and rendered
available for study. The necessary work of caring for the numerous
fresh specimens received has precluded the possibility of devoting very
much time to the exhibition series.

During the summer, while preparations for the New Orleans Exposi-
tion were being most busily carried on, an additional assistant, J. W.
Scollick, was assigned to this section.

In November, on account of the low condition of the New Orleans
appropriations, it was found necessary to dispense with Mr. McCormick’s
services. Mr. Scollick was transferred to the Museum roll.

(c) Modelers.

Mr. Joseph Palmer has been engaged in his usual work of making
casts. He has prepared for exhibition and set up in the Museum the
plaster casts of George Washington, Benjamin Silliman, and also the
bronzed plaster cast representing an Indian group. Several casts of
fishes, Indian pipes, reptiles, &c., were prepared by him for the New
Orleans, Louisville, and Cincinnati Expositions. Two large casts, one
of the spiny shark and one of the sperm whale porpoise, have been
made with the assistance of Mr. William Palmer, who also rendered
valuable service in unpacking, setting up, and repacking the collections
sent to the Louisville and Cincinnati Expositions.

Mr. J. W. Hendley has made progress in the preparation of casts of
animal and vegetable foods. It is intended that these casts shall be
exhibited in the Department of Foods, accompanied by a statement of
the chemical composition of the objects which they represent.
46 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.
(d) Photographer.

Mr. T. W. Smillie reports the addition to his files of 529 negatives
during the year. The following instruments have been purchased: One
large vertical copying camera; one small camera; one solar microscope,
including one heliostat; one camera with various illuminators, dia-
phragms, &c.; and a series of objectives from 4 inch to 4 inches. An
electric light has also been added to the apparatus of this section, ob-
viating tne necessity of delays by reason of cloudy weather.

The apparatus in this section is extremely complete, and the photo-
graphic laboratory is now thoroughly equipped for all kinds of work.
Several of the Government bureaus have recognized this fact, and have
occasionally requested the permission of the Director to have certain
scientific work performed here, some of which probably could not have,
been accomplished elsewhere. During 1884 Mr. Smillie has instructed
a class of ten ensigns of the United States Navy. One of these accom-
panied the Greely Relief Expedition, and preduced some very satisfae-
tory results with a camera. Instruction has also been given without
reserve to several scientific gentlemen who desired to acquire some
knowledge of this art preparatory to their departure on various scien-
tific expeditions.

As @ special application of this art to Museum purposes may be
mentioned certain work which has been performed for the Department
of Building Stones. Negatives have been made of typical buildings,
constructed of various kinds of stone. These have been enlarged on
paper 30 by 40 inches, and colored according to the natural colors of
the different kinds of stone. By means of polarized light photomi-
crographs were made from thin sections of stone. These were enlarged
on glass and colored with transparent tints, thus presenting a picture
of the section as seen with the microscope under polarized light. Spe-
cially noteworthy also were a number of photographic enlargements
representing thirteen of the Government buildings in Washington.
These are the largest single prints ever made, and have been found par-
ticularly effective at the New Orleans and Cincinnati Expositions, it
being thought that in an exhibition of the work of the Government De-
partments, such as has been attempted this year by the United States
Executive Board, it is particularly appropriate that the public buildings
of Washington should be shown in an impressive manner.

The work accomplished in this section during 1884 is as follows:

In addition to this 2,200 plates have been numbered, and filed for

future use.
(e) Artist.

Mr. A. Zeno Shindler has been engaged in painting casts of fishes,
reptiles, &c., for the Museum and for the Louisville, Cincinnati, and
New Orleans Expositions. He has also made numerous sketches in oil
and water-color of certain specimens on exhibition in the Museum.
Four full-sized Indian busts were also painted by him for exhibition at
New Orleans in connection with the ethnological department of the
Museum.

(f) Preparators in the Division of Anthropology.

Mr. E, H. Hawley has been for the greater part of the year engaged
in mounting collections for the New Orleans, Louisville, and Cincinnati
Expositions. During the early part of the year he also arranged for
exhibition the collections received from the foreign exhibition, held in
Boston during the latter part of 1883. In November and December
eight valuable India cashmere shawls were mounted and placed on ex-
hibition in the Museum. An interesting collection from the Dennison
Manufacturing Company, consisting of the ingredients used in the prep-
aration of sealing wax, together with the manufactured products, is be-
ing installed by Mr. Hawley; also, a magnificent collection of ostrich
feathers presented by Mr. R. T. Béné, and imported by Joseph Andrade
and Company, and some fine specimens of walrus leathers received from

¥F. W. Gesswein.

Mr. T. M. Sweeny devoted his time during the first half of the year
to the mounting of ethnological objects for display in the National Mu-
seum. Assoon as the Department of Ethnology was organized, iu July,
he was assigned as assistant to the curator, Prof. O. T. Mason.

16. WORK IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXPOSITIONS.
(a) The Cincinnati, Louisville, and New Orleans Expositions.

The participation of the Smithsonian Institution, as directed by Con-
gress, in three exhibitions, has—although in many respects detrimental
to the growth of the Museum—contributed largely to the prosperity of
several of its departments. In the first place, in order that material
might properly be selected for exhibition, it was found necessary in
many departments of the Museum to employ additional assistants in
making a thorough overhauling of the material and getting it system-
atically arranged. In the second place, it was found necessary to pur-
chase a considerable amount of material to fill vacancies in the various
series of specimens which were shown at the exhibitions.

It has been our policy to expend the appropriation for the New Or-
leans Exposition in such a manner that there also might result a per-
48 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEMM, 1884.

manent benefit to the Museum. This we have found to be entirely con-
sistent with the interests of the exhibitions, since the material which is
useful for these temporary displays is even more useful for the perma-
nent exhibition series of the Museum. At the same time, in many of
the departments an effort has been made, in selecting specimens for the
expositions, to make use of duplicate material from the Museu, in
order that, should we be called upon in future to participate in other
expositions, the preparation of a collection can be effected with less
expense of time and money than has been heretofore practicable.

In the report for 1885 I hope to include an extended account of the
New Orleans Exposition, with special reference to the specimens ac-
quired for the National Museum by gifts and exchanges.

The following statement will, however, serve to indicate the extent
of the preparations made by the Smithsonian Institution for participa-
tion in the expositions at Louisville, Cincinnati, and New Orleans:

The following preliminary report upon the exposition work of the
year has been prepared by Mr. R. Edward Earll, the head of the special
exposition staff:

On July 7 Congress passed a bill authorizing the representation of
the various executive departments of the Government, including the
Smithsonian Institution and Department of Agriculture, at the World’s
Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition to be opened in New
Orleans December 1, and to continue for six months. The bill further
provided for an exhibit by each of the departments at the Southern
Exposition to be held at Louisville, Ky., and at the Industrial Ex-
position at Cincinnati, Ohio. The bill authorized the appointment by
the President of representatives for each of the departments, these to
constitute a United States Executive Board, to whom all questions re-
lating to the Government participation in the various expositions were
to be referred. Each representative was to be charged with the prep-’
aration of an exhibit for his department, and the funds placed to its
credit by Congress were to be disbursed under his direction. Mr. G.
Brown Goode, Assistant Director of the U. S. National Museum, who
had represented the U.S. Fish Commission at Berlin in 1880, and at
London in 1883, was appointed to represent the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, including the U. S. National Museum and U.S. Fish Commission.
Seventy-five thousand dollars were placed to the credit of the Institu-
tion for the preparation of exhibits for New Orleans, with twenty-four
hundred dollars additional for Louisville and twenty-three hundred
dollars for Cincinnati.

THE EXHIBIT AT LOUISVILLE.

In 1883 the people of Louisville obtained contro] of a large plat of
ground within easy access of the city and erected a building 920 feet by
630, with extensive galleries, where they held a large and successful
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 49

exposition, continuing for three months. The exposition of 1884 was
held under the same auspices and in the same building, opening August
16 and closing October 25.
Immediately upon the passage of the bill by Congress correspondence
was opened with the management of the exposition and space obtained
in different portions of the building for the several executive depart-
ments, 4,500 feet being assigned to the Smithsonian Institution, in one
of the most prominent portions of the building. The time being short,
the work of preparing the exhibit was vigorously prosecuted, and on
August 12 three car-loads, containing 95 cases, with a weight of
23,553 pounds, were shipped. These arrived at Louisville on the morn-
ing of the 16th, and by the evening of the 19th were fully installed.
The industrial interests of Kentucky were taken into consideration
in deciding upon the character of the exhibit, which it was thought de-
sirable to make as instructive as possible. It was largely an educa-
tional exhibit, showing the processes of manufacture of raw materials
which were abundant in the State, and a graphic representation of such
subjects as were supposed to be least familiar to the people of Kentucky.
One of the prominent features of the exhibit was a large collection
showing the processes of manufacturing textiles from raw materials,
including flax, hemp, jute, grasses, and silk. A collection illustrative
of articles derived from the animal kingdom was also shown. This in-
cluded a series of furs, another of crude and manufactured leathers, a
third of natural and ornamental shells and shell-works, another illus-
trating the uses of feathers in the arts, and a fifth showing the manu-
facture and uses of glues derived from the sounds, bones, and skins of
various species of fish. An extensive collection illustrative of the great
ocean fisheries of the New England coast was also shown. The whale
fishery was illustrated by means of a full-sized whale-boat, fully equipped
with sails, oars, harpoons, lines, and guns; a model of a whale-ship
with a whale alongside, showing the method of stripping the blubber,
and trying it out on the vessel’s deck, and by paintings of whaling
scenes. The other fisheries, including those for cod, mackerel, men-
haden, and herring, and the apparatus and methods of fish-culture, were
fully shown by models of the most important vessels and boats, and a
series of photographs 30 by 40 inches, neatly framed, classified, and
mounted on screens. The natural-history collections included a repre-
sentation of nearly all of the snakes and reptiles found in the United
States, and a fine series of many of the water-birds of the country.
An attendant was left in charge of the exhibits during the continu-
ance of the exposition, and at its close the exhibits were carefully
packed and a majority of them forwarded directly to New Orleans, a
few being returned to Washington to be remounted, with larger and
more complete collections, before shipping to the New Orleans Exposi-

‘ion.

THE EXHIBIT AT CINCINNATI.

The Cincinnati Industrial Exposition is an institution of some years
standing, and receives the cordial support of the most prominent busi-
ness men of the city. Expositions have been held annually since 1873,
a suitable and substantial brick building having been erected by the
management. It is located in the heart of the city, and has annually a
large attendance. For the season of 1884 the exposition opened on
September 3, closing on the fourth of the following month.

As the space was mostly allotted before the bill authorizing Govern-
ment participation in the exposition had become a law, a second build-
ing to accommodate the Government exhibits was found necessary, and
the management erected a temporary structure near the main entrance,
having dimensions of 50 by 200 feet. This was divided between the
several departments, 3,322 square feet, or nearly one-third of the entire
building, being allotted to the Smithsonian Institution. This space
was situated at one end of the structure, thus admitting of a satisfactory
and very pleasing installation.

As soon as the Louisville exhibits were in place the work of pre-
paring those for Cincinnati was vigorously pushed, and the entire col-
lection consisting of 80 cases of exhibits with a weight of 24,321 pounds
was shipped on August 26, reaching the exposition at Cincinnati on
September 1. A large force of men was at once set to work to unpack
and arrange them, and by the opening of the exposition the arrange-
ment was practically completed.

As at Louisville, the exhibits were largely educational, and included
such objects as it was thought would be appreciated by those who saw
them. One of the striking features of the exhibit was an alcove con-
taining a collection illustrative of the social life and industries of the
Eskimo and the Indians of the northwest coast; the dwellings, house-
hold utensils, and implements of war, hunting and fishing, as well as
the art of the two races being shown in such a manner as to afford
accurate means of comparison. A life-size bust in plaster of one of
the prominent Indian chiefs with portraits in oil of thirteen others were
also exhibited. Another important feature was a large and valuable
collection of minerals yielding gems and ornamental stones. The
natural history department contained a small but choice collection of
taxidermy, including game and water birds, sparrows, and a few mam-
mals, while a full series of Audubon colored plates of North American
birds were framed and used for decoration. Two cases were devoted
to a large collection of plaster casts of the more common snakes and
turtles of the United States. The methods and apparatus employed in
the great ocean fisheries and in fish culture were graphically repre-
sented by means of two extensive series of photographs, the largest
series being solar enlargement having dimensions of 30 by 40 inches.
In the fishery section was also shown a large and valuable collection of
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 51

plaster casts of the important food-fishes of the country, including both
fresh and salt water species. The collection of textile fabries was very
complete, including samples of many of both American and foreign
fabrics, from the cheapest to the most expensive. Two alcoves, which
attracted considerable attention, were devoted to photolithographs of
Japanese pottery, and a large collection of photographs showing the
arts of the early Saxons.

As at Louisville, the collections were placed in charge of an attendant
who looked after the interests of the department during the continuance
of the exposition, and at its close the exhibits were packed and the
bulk of them shipped to New Orleans, to be installed with other exhibits
at the exposition in that city.

THE EXHIBIT AT NEW ORLEANS.

The preparations for the exhibit at New Orleans have been very exten-
sive. Curators from the various departments of the Museum have been
charged with the collection of material to illustrate their several depart-
ments at the exposition, and assistants have been employed in arrang-
ing and mounting the collections, which, as a rule, have been provided
with printed or written descriptive labels.

The building for the display of the Government and State exhibits
at New Orleans is 885 feet long and 565 feet wide. <A strip 185 feet
wide, extending entirely across the center of the building has been
assigned to the Government departments, the Smithsonian Institution
occupying an area of over twenty thousand square feet at the left of
the principal entrance of the building.

The exhibit includes an archeological collection of considerable sizes
a large and valuable ethnological collection, confined chiefly to the
Indians and Eskimo of North America; a collection of models showing
the development of American ship-building; a collection of American
and foreign textiles, and a large and valuable collection of autotypes
representing the principal artists of the world. Adjoining the last is
a collection of all of the important food-fishes of the country in plaster,
a collection illustrative of the recent methods of fish culture and the
more important forms of fish-ladders, together with tabulated state-
ments of the nutritive values of fish and other aquatic animals. Next
comes an extensive collection of animal products, showing the various
methods of utilizing the hair, fur, feathers, scales, leather, flesh, bones,
intestines, and excrements of various animals. Adjoining this, and serv-
ing as a connection between it and the natural history specimens, is a
collection illustrating the various devices used in the capture of animals.
The natural history collection includes specimens of the principal mam-
mals, birds, and shells, the latter being arranged according to their
geographical location, the molluscan life of the Atlantic coast, the Miss-
52 REPORT OF NATIONAL MEUSEUM, 1884.

issippi basin, and the Pacific being shown separately. Seven cases are
devoted to an extensive collection of minerals, while a large space is
assigned to metallurgy and economic geology, including a collection
illustrating the apparatus and methods of coal mining, and samples of
the various grades of commercial coal.

The entire collection, occupying seventeen cars, was sent to New Or-
leans, where it is now being installed in as systematic a manner as
possible, the educational idea being prominent in the arrangement.

During the progress of the several expositions many of the curators
were in attendance for a short time, in order to give their personal at-
tention to the installment of their exhibits. The Assistant Director left
here on December 6, to be present at the opening of the New Orleans
Exposition, and was thus enabled to superintend in person the installa-
tion of the Smithsonian exhibit so far as it was possible to complete
this by the opening day. Mr. Henry Horan, superintendent of the
National Museum, was detailed to attend to the three expositions at
various times between August 13 and November 30, in order to assist
in the arrangement of the cases. He also attended to the shipment
from Cincinnati to New Orleans of the cases intended for display at the
latter place.

INTERNATIONAL FISHERIES EXHIBITION OF LONDON.

The International Fisheries Exhibition of 1883 closed on October 31,
and Mr. Earll, with his assistants, who were left in charge after my re-
turn, reached Washington soon after the beginning of the year, the
last shipment of collections from London having already been received.
The reception, unpacking, and installation of the collections which
were prepared to be sent to London, together with the new material
obtained from the collections of other countries at this exhibition, oc-
cupied a great deal of time in the early part of the year. As has already
been mentioned, this work was completed in a preliminary manner in
May, during which month the fisheries gallery was opened to the pub-
lic. At the same time the gallery devoted to naval architecture—a
department which also received great impetus in connection with the
London Exhibition—was also thrown open. The fisheries collection
will undoubtedly for some years stand as the first completed and most
thoroughly arranged collection in the department of arts and indus-
tries. During the year a full catalogue of the collection, as shown in
London, has been printed, which, although far from corresponding to
the standard proposed for the Museum hand-books, will serve as a
starting point for this series. This catalogue may be considered as a
report upon the participation by the United States in the London Fish-
eries Exhibition. The report upon the general exhibition is now, as the
law requires, in course of preparation, and will be presented to the Sec-
retary of State during the coming year,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 53

E.—REVIEW OF ‘THE YEAR’S WORK IN THE SCIENTIFIC
DEPARTMENTS.

As in my last report, I here present a brief review of what has been
accomplished in each department of the several scientific divisions.
The curators’ reports are given in full in Part II of this report. These
are especially intended to embrace (1) a review of the important addi-
tions during the year; (2) a statement of the character of routine work
employed in arranging and classifying the collections, and in preparing
the exhibition and study series.

17. DIVISION OF ANTHROPOLOGY.
(a) Department of Arts and Industries.

The curator of this department is the custodian of all materials pos-
sessing anthropological significance, which are not elsewhere assigned.
Its belongings are consequently somewhat heterogeneous and difficult
to report upon, and its relations with the Department of Ethnology are
so, intimate that it is impossible to make a definite division between
them. Certain collections belonging to this department are under the
charge of other curators, the collection of building-stones being as-
signed to the department of lithology and physical geology, while all
that relates to mining and metal-working is cared for by the curator of
metallurgy and economic geology. Several sub-curatorships have
grown up in this department, and certain other collections, especially
those of architecture, musical instruments, and modern ceramics, to-
gether with the somewhat anomalous collection of historical objects,
are at present assigned to this curatorship.

When, in 1857, the Smithsonian Institution assumed the custody of
the collection of the United States Exploring Expedition, together with
the miscellaneous material which had gathered around this nucleus, a
great quantity of material was transferred to the Smithsonian building
which has not to this day been classified and placed upon exhibition.
The rapid growth, especially during the past decade, of the collections
illustrating the ethnology of North American Indians, and especially
of prehistoric objects from this continent, has absorbed the attention of
all who were interested in this department of the Museum. The major-
ity of the foreign ethnological objects are still, on account of lack of
room, packed up or crowded together in a too limited amount of case-
room. At the close of the Centennial Exhibition the Museum received
from foreign Governments great quantities of material exhibited at
Philadelphia, which, while possessing an undoubted ethnological inter-
est, could not in many instances be displayed in the manner usually
adopted in ethnological museums.

The material received from Philadelphia in 1876 was for several years
stored in the Armory building. On completion of the present Museum
54 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

building, and before the collections could be transferred to it, it became
necessary to decide by what method the stored material (other than
zoological, botanical, geological, or mineralogical) could be most effect-
ively classified for purposes of study and exhibition.

After a careful consideration of the methods of the large museums of
Europe, the officers of the Museum agreed that the ordinary classifi-
cation by races or tribes would in this case be less satisfactory than a
classification based upon function.

The Report of the Smithsonian Institution for 1881, pages 117-122,
and also Circular No. 13, of the National Museum, presented a pro-
visional outline of the plan of classification for the Museum. This
classification, while its purpose was to embrace every kind of object
which could possibly be exhibited in the Museum, was especially full
in those parts which related to the arts and industries, forty-nine out
of the sixty-four primary classes relating to this group of museum
material. The general idea of the classification, as there explained, is
that the collections should constitute a museum of anthropology, the
word *“‘ anthropology” being applied in its most comprehensive sense.
It should exhibit the physical characteristics, the history, the manners
past and present of all races civilized and savage, and should also illus-
trate human culture and industry in all their phases; the earth, its
physical structure, and its products are to be exhibited with special
reference to their adaptation for use by man.

Some experiments have already been made with reference to the fea-
sibility of this plan of arranging the exhibition series, but I am not yet
prepared to recommend its final acceptance; indeed the experience of
three years has brought about many changes in the plan, and a revision
is now being made by Professor Mason and myself.

The adoption of any plan of this general character would necessitate
the grouping together, in continuous series, of objects which had never
before been placed side by side in any museum. If the evolution of
any given industry or class of objects is to be shown, the series should
begin with the simplest types and close with the most perfect and
elaborate objects of the same class which human effort has produced.

In the textile industry, for instance, at one extreme is shown the
simple whorl of stone or terra cotta, used by savage or semi-civilized
man, together with the archaic representative of the same, surviving
among rural members of the most highly civilized races; these being
supplemented by the threads and the simple woven fabrics produced
by them; on the other hand, the steam spinning apparatus and the
power and Jacquard looms.

Much attention has been devoted during the year to experiments for
determining the manner in which the idea of this classification can best
be carried into effect. It is not possible within the limits of this report
to describe what has been done. In fact a full account of them at pres-
ent would be premature. The practicability of the scheme can best be
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 55

judged upon by an examination of the one or two groups, such as the
materia medica collection, the collection of musical instruments, and the
portion of the costume collection, which are already partly installed.

The Department of Arts and Industries is not yet established upon
the same footing as the others in the Museum, nor is it yet quite cer-
tain what form it will assume in the future. I shall therefore not un-
dertake to present a formal report upon its operations, but shall sub-
mit in the appendix the reports of the curators of materia medica, tex-
tile industries, foods and naval architecture, and refer back to my re-
port of 1883 for a statement of the character of the work which was in
progress at the end of that year, and which has been continued during
the present year, so far as the interruptions connected with exposition
work have permitted.

The installation of the section of fisheries,* under the immediate
direction of Mr. R. E. Earll, was actively carried on from January to
May, and on the evening of May 14, at 7.30 p. m., the fisheries section
of the National Museum was formally opened to the public. This occa-
sion was one of special interest, from the fact that the collections in
this section were the same that had been exhibited at the International
Fisheries Exhibition at London in 1883, together with certain collec-
tions which had been acquired in London by gift and exchange. ‘The
building was illuminated by electric lights, fitted up for the occasion by
the Brush-Swan Electric Light Company. The Director of the Museum
held an informal reception in the north main hall. The number of
visitors on this occasion was 2,033.

This section presents no special report, except in the form of the cat-
alogue of the American section at the London Fisheries Exhibition,
which is in fact an elaborate report upon everything in the section, and
which is referred to elsewhere. At the New Orleans Exposition the
Department of Fisheries was represented by about sixty of the large
pictures prepared for the London Exhibition, and by about 200 casts of
American food-fishes, which also had direct relation to the animal prod-
ucts collection just referred to. It was not deemed expedient to dis-
mantle the general fishery collections so recently installed, for such a
temporary interest as that of these exhibitions. The United States Fish
Commission made preparations for a considerable display of fish-culture,
and a representative collection of fish-cultural apparatus was sent from
the Museum.

Mr. Hitchcock, the curator of the textile collection, has been prin- -
cipally occupied in exposition work, in connection with which he un-
dertook the preparation of a collection of textile fibers and fabrics.
Portions of this collection were exhibited both at Louisville and Cin-
cinnati.

Captain Collins, on behalf of the Department of Naval Architecture,
prepared a series of working models illustrating the development of

* Report U. §. N. M., 1883, pp. 16, 17.
56 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

the ship-building industry in the United States, and especially the evo-
lution of the American schooner, the American pilot-boat, and the
American cotton-ship. A number of full-rigged models were also sent
in this connection, being exhibited on the way at Louisville and Cin-
cinnati. The model of a whale-boat, fully equipped with all appliances
for the capture of whales, was also sent. This model attracted much
attention at the London and Berlin Fisheries Exhibitions.

The animal products collection, which was so prominent a feature in
the exhibition of this Institution at Philadelphia, has been reorganized
and greatly extended, so that it now represents very thoroughly the
applications of animals to the uses of mankind in all parts of the world.
This collection alone, if arranged in table-cases, would occupy a floor-
space equivalent to that in one of the large halls of the new Museum
building. The Museum has received many important gifts for this col-
lection on condition that they be exhibited in New Orleans before being
finally placed in the Museum.

A selection of about 250 of the celebrated autotypes published by
Adolph Braun & Co., of Dornach, have been acquired for use at the ex-
hibitions. This collection illustrates the history of painting from the
time of Cimabue and Giotto, including copies of from one to six of the
best representative works of each celebrated master so far as it was
practicable to obtain them. This collection can be packed in a very
small space, and is particularly well suited for sending away to exhibi-
tions. It may in future be somewhat extended to good advantage.

(b) Department of Ethnology.

Prof. Otis T. Mason, for many years connected with the Columbian
University, of this city, was appointed curator of this department upon
the 1st of July. The Museum may well be congratulated upon the ad-
dition of this skillful ethnologist to its staff. Professor Mason, as is
well known, was one of the first in America to embrace in his studies
the entire subject of the natural history of man, or what is known now
as the science of anthropology. His publications upon this subject,
beginning with his paper upon the Leipsic Museum, published in the
Smithsonian Annual Report for 1873; his articles upon ethnology in
Harper’s Record of Science and Industry from 1873 to 1877; the Smith-
sonian Record of Progress from 1878 to 1884; the directions for col-
lectors for the Centennial Exposition, issued by the Indian Bureau in
1875; his lectures in the Saturday course, delivered in the Museum;
also his papers presented to the American Association, and his contri-
butions to the American Naturalist, extending over a period of twenty
years, are all devoted to the comprehensive study of man.

He was the associate of the late Mr. Louis H. Morgan in organizing
the anthropological section of the American Association in 1876, and
was one of the founders of the Anthropological Society of Washington
in 1879, writing its constitution.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. a

A prominent. characteristic of his work has been the introduction of
regular scientific methods into anthropological inquiries, treating each
savage art as the anatomist or embryologist treats his subject.

The energy of Professor Mason has already produced important re-
sults in that the ethnological collections, never before under control,
have already been provisionally classified. In the present report are
presented three papers emanating from this department—on the bas-
ketry, throwing-sticks, and bows in the National Museum—and it is
much to be hoped that the method of investigation and publication
foreshadowed in these papers will be prosecuted until the discussion of
the whole round of savage art as exemplified in our collections shall
have been completed.

During the year 3,658 specimens belonging to primitive races have
been received. In addition to these this department has been intrusted
with many objects registered in other catalogues and deposited here
for the sake of completing evolutionary series of implements, processes,
and art products. The most noteworthy accessions in 1884 were as
follows :

Illustrations of Eskimo and Indian life, from Ungava Bay and vi-
cinity, by Lucien Turner, who will prepare a monograph upon the
specimens.

Illustrations of Eskimo life at Point Barrow, collected by Lieutenant
Ray, U.S. A. Mr. John Murdoch will describe these.

Rich collections from the Eskimo of Western and Southern Alaska,
by E. W. Nelson, W. J. Fisher, Charles L. McKay, and Baron Norden-
skjold.

Specimens of the arts of the tribes of Northwest America, collected
by James G. Swan and Lieut. T. Dix Bolles. .

Many objects illustrative of the modern Indians of Yueatan, by Louis
H. Aymé.

A very large and instructive collection of objects from the Peruvian
huacas, by George W. Keifer, and Dr. William H. Jones, U.S. N.

A collection of weapons &c., from New Guinea, purchased from A. P.
Goodwin.

An exchange series of weapons from Polynesia, contributed by
Charles Heape.

During the year illustrative series of ethnological objects have been
exhibited at Cincinnati, Louisville, and New Orleans, care being taken
in each case to impress some ethnological truth, such as distribution of
types, the effect of environment, the treatment of the same art by dif-
ferent tribes, or the progress of an art from its infancy to its highest
manifestation. This special collection was displayed in 120 unit boxes,
17 double unit boxes, 37 costume boxes, and 2 slope tables. In addi-
tion, 1 model of an Eskimo house, 1 model of a Haida house, and 2
Indian busts were sent.
58 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

(c.) Department of American Prehistoric Pottery.

Mr. William Hs» Holmes, having been assigned by the director of the
Bureau of Ethnology of the Smithsonian Institution to the work of
preparing a report upon American aboriginal pottery, has been ap-
pointed honorary curator of this section of the Museum. He has been
engaged during the year in classifying the entire collection and in pre-
paring the exhibition series. The northwest court, which has been as-
signed to this section, will be opened to the public as soon as cases can
be provided and the specimens installed. More than 10,000 specimens
have been added to this department during the year. By far the most
prominent among the contributors is the Bureau of Ethnology, which
has added 6,000 pieces of pottery to this department. A magnificent
accession of 3,000 vases from the tombs of Chiriqui was bought from
Mr. J. C. MeNeil, and a very valuable collection from Peru has been re-
ceived through the agency of Dr. William H. Jones, U.S. N.

(ad) Department of Antiquities.

The Department of Prehistoric Antiquities, under the charge of Dr.
Charles Rau, has kept pace with all the others in growth and general
progress. The present somewhat unsettled condition of the upper main
hall of the Smithsonian building, in which these collections are exhib-
ited, is due to the fact that the arts and industries collections, formerly
placed here, have not been entirely removed, owing to the lack of ex-
hibition cases in the new building. The arrangement of the gallery of
antiquities is, however, as far advanced as any in the Museum. To as
great an extent as opportunity and case-room have permitted, Dr. Rau
has carried out his double system of arrangement, placing in one ex-
tensive series, which is for the most part exhibited in flat cases, col-
lections grouped according to material and form, enabling visitors to
take in at a glance ‘‘ the whole culture of prehistoric North America, in
so far as can be represented by tangible tokens.” In another series are
placed special collections, including the articles found in given single
localities, whether mounds, graves, or shell-deposit districts. It is in
the arrangement of these special collections that the most noticeable
changes have been made.

Here, as elsewhere, the preparations for the New Orleans Exposition
have seriously interfered with the general work. An extensive educa-
tional series of stone implements, illustrating American archeology, has,
however, been prepared, and casts have been made of every character-
istic form of stone implement. The collection, when complete, will con-
stitute, in fact, a set of illustrations in actuality of the text of Dr. Rau’s
paper entitled ‘‘ The Archeological. Collection of the United States Na-
tional Museum,”* and the work, which has been done well, will be of

service not only for future exhibitions, but in the preparation of typical
collections to be distributed to educational institutions.

The number of accessions during the year amounted to 5,441, and the
total number of specimens in the collection is 45,252, of which 8,522 are
duplicates. The principal literary product of the department has been
a work upon prehistoric fishing in Europe and North America, pre-
pared by the curator.

18. DIVISION OF ZOOLOGY.

(a) Department of Mammals.

Notwithstanding the absence of the curator, Mr. Frederick W. True,
in Europe during the first quarter of the year, and other diversions of
. his attention and time to routine work not connected with his regular
duties, the progress of this department has been exceedingly satisfac-
tory. The work upon the exhibition series has been hampered by the
fact that money has not been available for the construction of the de-
sired cases in the mammal hall. The collection is now, for the first
time in many years, thoroughly classified and under control, and the
total number of skins and alcoholic specimens is reported to be 5,604,
of skulls and skeletons 4,212, making a total of 9,908.

The accessions of the year have, in number, variety, and importance,
been fully equal to those of earlier periods. No less than 38 specimens,
including such rare and peculiar forms as the eland, harnessed antelope,
cheetah, two species of lemur, wart-hog, and baboons, have been re-
ceived from the proprietors of zoological gardens and menageries, for
which due acknowledgments are given in the Museum report. An un-
usual number of cetaceans and seals, many of great novelty and inter-
est, have been received from various sources. The amount of taxider-
mie work accomplished has been unusually great, owing to a special
allotment for the employment of extra help, made from the appropria-
tion for the New Orleans Exhibition, 149 specimens in all having been
added to the mounted series, including several large forms such as the
buffalo, puma, jaguar, and beaver.

(b) Department of Birds.

This year is shown by the report of Mr. Ridgway to have been one
of unusual activity in the Department of Birds. The collections have
been entirely rearranged, and the exhibition series is receiving a com-
plete overhauling. Over 1,200 skins have been mounted, and several
hundred of them fastened on walnut stands. Copy for 1,000 labels has
been prepared. The total number of specimens in the reserve series is
50,550, 6,800 of which are in the exhibition series. In this, as in several
other departments, the main direction of effort during the year was to-
wards the preparation of the special exhibit of North American game-
birds for the New Orleans Exposition, comprising 171 specimens, repre-
60 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

senting 123 species. Considerable time was also spent in unpacking
and installing the exhibits which had been sent to the International
Fisheries Exhibition, London, in 1883. -

Mr. Ridgway reports that the year has been unprecedented in the
extent of the accessions. The number of birds added during the year
is 8,142, 2,658 skins having been distributed. Of this number 94 speci-
mens were collected during the cruise of the United States Fish Com-
mission steamer Albatross among the West India Islands; 675 speci-
mens, mainly from Japan, and presented by Capt. T. W. Blackiston;
473 specimens from the British Museum; 768 specimens from Alaska
and 21 specimens from Arizona, collected by E. W. Nelson; 256 speci-
mens, chiefly from India, received from Mr. R. Bowdler Sharpe, of the
British Museum; 84 specimens presented by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger;
478 specimens from Northern California, and 55 specimens from the Far- ~
allone Islands, collected by Mr. Charles H. Townsend; and 1,705 speci-
mens from Ungava, Labrador, collected by Mr. Lucien M. Turner,
Many other large and valuable accessions were also made, as will be
seen by referring to the list of accessions, in the report of the curator.
Nearly 3,000.specimens were sent out in exchange or loaned for exami-
nation.

Birds’ eggs.

The collection of birds’ eggs’ has been overhauled and rearranged

by Capt. Charles E. Bendire, U.S. A., the honorary curator of this de-
partment, who has also presented to the Museum his magnificent col-
leetion of about 8,000 eggs. The grand total of specimens in this sec-
tion is 40,072, of which 35,800 are North American. This collection now
represents nearly all that is known of American oology, and contains
40,072 specimens, of which 4,272 are foreign.
- A large collection of 468 specimens was received from Dr. James C.
Merrill, U. S. A. Other important accessions were made by Mr. E.
W. Nelson, Lieut. P. H. Ray, U.S. A., Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, Mr.
Charles H. Townsend, Governor Fencher, of Godthaab, Greenland, and
others.

Forty-five specimens were exchanged or loaned for examination.

(c) Department of Reptiles and Batrachians.

Extensive and valuable additions have been made to the collections
of this department during the year. Dr. H. C. Yarrow has continued
to serve as curator in the capacity of volunteer. It has not yet been
found practicable to assign any space in the Museum for the exhibition
of these collections, and owing to the already crowded condition of the
new Museum building it is feared that no exhibition space can be as-
signed to this department until the Museum shall have been enabled to
extend its walls. During the summer the curator visited Utah for the
purpose of scientific study, and while there collected many interesting
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR 61

specimens of reptiles, which were added to the Museum collections.
The principal accessions to this department in 1884 were made by Capt.
Charles Bendire, U. 8S. A., Mr. Charles H. Townsend, Mr. C.J. Hering,
and by the scientific staff which accompanied the United States Fish
Commission steamer Albatross on her cruise to the West Indies.

(ad) Department of Fishes.

The work upon this extensive and unwieldly collection has made fine
progress during the year. The curator, Dr. Bean, has nearly completed
his card catalogue of the reserve series, and during the summer Prof.
D. 8. Jordan was employed, in the interest of the New Orleans Exhibi-
tion, in selecting out a special exhibition series to include all the fresh-
water fishes of the United States, and to make a special collecting trip
through the Mississippi Valley, with the view to supply such species as
were lacking in the collection. This trip has been of great importance
to the science of ichthyology, bringing to light very many important
facts concerning the fishes of a region not previously explored ichthyo-
logically, and throwing much light upon the whole subject of distri-
bution. Out of the 560 fresh-water species known to inhabit North
America, the Museum now has all but 49, 30 having been added by this
trip, and some 25 new species having been brought to light.

Of the $3 accessions to this department during the year 34 are re-
garded as of great value. <A large collection was received from Mr. L.
M. Turner. The U.S. Fish Commission contributed fifteen bottles of
deep-sea forms, including at least 20 new fishes from the deep-sea fauna.
These were of great value. Prof. D.S. Jordan sent a collection of Vene-
tian fishes containing 23 species; a large collection of fishes from Cuba
and Florida, containing many new species; a collection of fresh-water
fishes from Southern Missouri, Kansas, Arkansas, Indian Territory, In-
diana, &c. The curator added to the collection of this department 63
species of marine and fresh-water fishes from Great South Bay, Long
Island, and vicinity.

The total number of entries in the catalogue during the year was
3,015. '

During the year 127 drawings of fisbes were added to the portfolio,
117 of which were made by Mr. H. L. Todd, and 10 by Miss. M. M. Smith,
whose ability for this work is very decided.

Forty-one papers based upon material belonging to the department
were published by signatures in the Proceedings of the National Mu-
seum for 1554.

The number of specimens in the collections is estimated at about
68,000, of which 36,000 are in the reserve series, 21,000 on exhibition,
and some 12,000 duplicates.

A laborious and slow operation has been the transfer of the specimens
from the old tanks into new ones and into glass jars.
62 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.
(e) Department of Comparative Anatomy.

A Department of Comparative Anatomy is being organized, under the
charge of Mr. Frederick W. True, and the east-south range has been
fitted up with aset of cases especially constructed after new designs for
the reception of the preparations. Mr. Lucas, with his two assistants,
has been engaged during the latter part of the year in mounting skele-
tons, and fully 150 fine preparations have been put on exhibition. The
report of Mr. True upon the plan of organization will not be presented
until next year, since much preparatory work remains to be done. A
case illustrating the work in this department was sent to the New Or-
leans Exposition.

(f) Department of Mollusks.

Mr. W. H. Dall, who has for many years had charge of the collection
of mollusks, having been appointed one of the paleontologists of the
Geological Survey, and assigned to the Department of Quaternary Mol-
lusks, has, by the request of the Director of the Survey, been assigned
working-rooms in the Smithsonian building, and will continue to care
for the department as heretofore, access to the collections of recent
shells being necessary for comparison with the shells of the Quaternary
beds, which are, for the most part, specifically identical. Prof. R. H.C.
Stearns, late of the University of California, has been assigned to this
department as adjunct curator, and since the 1st of July there has
been great activity in rearranging the collections. It was decided to
make an extensive display of the mollusks of the United States at the
New Orleans Exposition, and the well-known Stearns collection of mol-
lusks, for which negotiations had been in progress for some years, was
purchased from the exhibition appropriation. Professor Stearns had
in charge the preparation of the series for New Orleans, which occupied
his time from July until the end of the year. This occupied twenty
large cases, and exhibits the economic mollusks of both coasts and the
adjacent seas, and the fresh-water mussels which form so remarkable a
part of the fauna of the great Mississippi basin. Mr. R. Ellsworth Call
has been employed for six months in connection with the New Orleans
work, and by the efforts of these three conchologists, with the help of
two clerks, much progress has been made toward getting under final
control the immense mass of material in this department.

The identification of the specimens representing the American land
shells has occupied the attention of the curator. He has also devoted
himself to the study of the deep-sea forms obtained from the Gulf of
Mexico and the Caribbean Sea by Prof. Alexander Agassiz.

It is Mr. Dall’s opinion that, when the mass of material which yet re-
mains to be examined has been classified, the national collections, as
far as the fauna of North America and its adjacent seas is concerned,
will not be surpassed by any other collection in the world,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. — 63

The most important accessions to this department in 1884 were pre-
sented by Henry Hemphill, the United States Signal Office, Dr. Leon-
hard Stejneger, Rev. E. Lehnert, Dr. William H. Jones, U.S. N., and
ht. Ellsworth Call.

(g) Department of Insects.

Prof. C. V. Riley has, as in previous years, voluntarily assumed the
care of the entomological material which has come in, and his own
valuable and constantly-increasing collection remains a deposit in the
Museum. A collection of insects injurious to forest trees, mounted in
Museum cases, in the style which it is proposed by Professor Riley to
adopt in the arrangement of our exhibition series when the opportunity
comes, was sent to the International Forestry Exhibition in Edinburgh
and received a gold medal. Fifty-five accession lots were received
during the year, the nfost valuable being the collection made by L. M.
Turner, at Ungava Bay, H. B. T.

There were 55 accessions to this department during the year, of which
the collections made by Mr. Lucien M. Turner is perhaps the most val-
uable. ;

The curator was called epon by the Department of Agriculture to pre-
pare an exhibit for the New Orleans Exposition, and it was agreed that
upon the return of this exhibit to Washington it should be incorporated
with the Museum collections. It is hoped that the financial condition
of the Museum will soon warrant the placing of this very important and
long-neglected department upon a footing of equality with the others.

(h) Department of Marine Invertebrates.*

In the Department of Marine Invertebrates, exclusive of the mollusca,
under the charge of Mr. Rathbun, 240 cases or specimens, enumerated
in 72 accessions, have been added during the year. Of these, the most
important have been received from the United States Fish Commission,
from Dr. Edward Palmer, a collector employed in the interest of the
New Orleans Exhibition, and from various naval sources. The Fish
Commission collections are mainly illustrative of the recent deep-sea
explorations of the steamer Albatross, off the eastern coast of the United
States, and in the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea, and contain many
new additions to science, which have been worked up only in part. They
fill several thousand jars and vials. The collection of Dr. Palmer was
made for the purpose of representing, at the World’s Fair in New
Orleans, the varied animal resources of the coral reef and sponge re-
gions of southern and western Florida. It consists for the most part
of finely prepared specimens of commercial and other sponges, orna-
mental corals, and the larger species of crustaceans and mollusks used
as food, and required 65 large shipping cases to’ transport it to Wash-
ington. Supplemental to this is an extensive collection made by Mr.
Henry Hemphill on the western coast of Florida.

* Exclusive of the mollusea.
64 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

Among the more interesting of the naval contributions are several col-
lections of crustaceans and echinoderms obtained by Dr. W. H. Jones,
U.S. N., in different parts of the Pacific Ocean. A number of valuable
collections, carefully identified, have also been received from competent
European authorities, and will be of great service in the elaboration of
new materials contained in the Museum.

The increase of accessions to this department has been so great dur-
ing the year, especially by reason of the material furnished by the Fish
Commission, that, even with the aid of three or four assistants, little
more could be done than to take care of the new material.

(i) Department of Invertebrate Fossils (Paleozoic Section).

The collections of this department are arranged in 13 unit table cases,
and in office trays equivalent in capacity toas many more. Mr. Walcott
estimates the total number of specimens at 25,000, including the old
Smithsonian collections, and the accessions from the recent Govern-
ment surveys and other sources up to the present time. The most im-
portant accession of the year is that of Devonian and Carboniferous
fossils from the United States Geological Survey, many of them types
of new species, and forming the basis of Mr. Walcott’s recent report
upon *“ The Paleontology of the Eureka District, Nevada.”

Mr. Walcott has devoted his time chiefly to the identification and
labeling of the accessions, and has, as far as possible, advanced the
work of arranging the old collections of the Smithsonian Institution.
Inasmuch as the curator holds the position of paleozoic paleontologist
of the United States Geological Survey, it is impossible that progress
in the work upon the Museum collections can be as rapid as would be
the case were it practicable for Mr. Walcott to devote his entire time
to these. It must, however, be remembered that these result, from his
work in connection with the Geological Survey, in many important addi-
tions to the Museum collections.

A comparison between the unassorted condition of the collections
under Mr. Walcott’s care in the winter of 1883 with their present state
of classification and arrangement makes evident the fact that this de-
partment is among the most highly developed in the Museum.

(k) Department of Invertebrate Fossils (Meso-Cenozoic Section).

The accessions of the year in this department consist of 85 boxes
from the Geological Survey, embracing collections made in California,
Oregon, New Jersey, Florida, Alabama, and Mississippi, and 15 miscel-
laneous lots seut from private sources to the Museum. The catalogue
numbers 1,158 entries. From Dr. White, the curator of this depart-
ment, as from many others, there comes a request for more room; these
requests we are striving to grant as rapidly as the appropriation for
the construction of cases will allow, but it is doubtful if the necessi-
ties of the case can be fully met until a new building can be put up.
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 65

Dr. White is preparing a complete index of all the mesozoic and ceno-
zoic invertebrate fossils of North America. <A catalogue of all the
type-specimens of the mesozoic and cenozoic species belonging to the
Museum, is nearly completed.

19. DIVISION OF BOTANY.

(a) Department of Plants, Fossil and Recent.

The collection of fossil plants now contains 923 distinct species iden-
tified and installed. The report of Prof. Lester F. Ward contains
elaborate statistics of the collection, from which it appears that 7,291
specimens have already been catalogued. The accessions of the year
have been of but slight importance. The Joad collection of recent
plants has not yet been unpacked, owing to lack of room, but will soon
be arranged and in proper condition for study. During the year Mr.
William R. Smith, superintendent of the Government botanic gardens,
has placed in the rotunda of the new building a number of very beau-
tiful palms, which add very much to the attractiveness of the apart-
ment, and which, having been selected with reference to their economic
importance to man, will, when labeled, furnish instruction as well as
pleasure to the visitors.

Through the assistance of Mr. Frank H. Knowlton, the curator has
been enabled to classify and catalogue a large mass of unassorted ma-
terial which has accumulated in this department.

20. DIVISION OF GEOLOGY.
(a) Department of Mineralogy.

Considerable progress has been achieved in the development of this
department. - The curator has performed valuable work in instituting
scientific investigation upon specimens, the results of which have been
valuable to the Museum.

During the year the growth of the collections has heer steady and
encouraging, the work of installing the collections has been definitely
begun, and a system of exchanges has been fairly inaugurated. The
reserve series contains 5,881 specimens, and the duplicate series, 5,883.

The accessions have been large and numerous. The most important
is that of Mr. Joseph Willcox, Media, Pa. This collection consists of
about 1,400 specimens, and is in some respects one of the finest in
America. The collection of Col. J. J. Abert, presented by his son, J.
T. Abert, and consisting of 1,245 specimens, is also of great value and
interest.

An allotment of $2,500 from the New Orleans appropriation was de-
voted to building up the collection of gems and ornamental stones. The
schedule adopted included all the gems proper, rock crystal, agates and
jaspers, malachite, lapis-lazuli, &c., and every important gem or orna-
mental species was secured both in the rough and cut conditions.

8. Mis, 33, pt. 2—~6
66 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

About 1,000 specimens are on exhibition at New Orleans, of which
nearly one-third are cut and polished.stones. A part of this collection
was exhibited at Cincinnati, whene it was awarded a silver medal.
In connection with the New Orleans work, two important collecting
trips were made ‘by Mr. Yeates to northern New York, and the Hot
Springs of Arkansas. The total number of specimens in the collection
is estimated at 15,288. The curator, while in the field in connection
with the United States Geological Survey, did excellent work for the
Museum. Many good things were also obtained through exchange.

(b) Department of Lithology and Physical Geology.

The accessions to this department, which is under the curatorship of
Mr. George P. Merrill, have been very numerous. The total number of
entries amounts to 2,541, including not less than 300 specimens adminis-
stered upon during the year. Important contributions have been re-
ceived from 107 sources, besides many others of minor value. ‘The most
prominent donations to the department were a series of rocks and
tufas from Utah, Nevada, and California, collected by Mr. I. C. Russell
and transferred by the Geological Survey, and a large collection of
building-stones from Mr. John 8. F. Batchen; Messrs. Wharton, Hough-
ton, Bartlett, and Marshall, Messrs. Abbott and Stearns, Lieut. G. N.
Stoney, Mr. J. 8. Diller, Dr. T. M. Chatard, the Esperanza Marble Comn-
pany, Mr. L. J. Griffin, Mr. A. C. Proctor, Bowker, Torrey & Company,
Messrs. Dimond & Hall, and Prof. Thomas Robinson, also made valu-
able contributions. Mr. Merrill prepared a large and important series
of specimens of the building and ornamental stones of the United
States for the New Orleans Exposition, comprising 358 specimens, an
educational series of rocks, containing 500 specimens, and a collection
of rock-forming minerals. In this work he had the efficient assistance
of Mr. L. H. Merrill, and the services of a number of stone-cutters for
some months. In addition to this work, 1,557 descriptive labels were
printed and 200 thin sections of rocks prepared.

The exhibition series of the lithological collections comprises about
800 specimens, and this number can easily be doubled as soon as cases
are provided. Some of the beautiful colored photographic enlarge-
ments on glass, illustrating the structure of twelve selected types of
rocks, were among the most striking products of the year’s work in
Mr. Merrill’s laboratory and are of very great educational value. As ¢
supplement to the building-stone collection, a set of photographic nega-
tives of some of the more important stone buildings in the country has
been made, and from them enlarged prints (30 by 40 inches) have been
prepared and colored, showing the appearance of various kinds of
building stones used in architectural work.

The most important collections in the Department of Physical Geology
are: the collection of lavas from Ice Springs Butte, Utah; two speci-

mens of glacial polished mica from Prof. Ff, W. Clarke, and one large

x. -
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 67

block of glacial polished marble, a gift of the Gouverneur Marble Com-
pany.

The total number of specimens in the reserve series is estimated at
15,000, of which some 3,000 are on exhibition. Of these 4,246 are
building or ornamental stones, 1,658 of which are on exhibition. The
number of specimens in the duplicate series is about 5,000,

(¢) Department of Metallurgy and Economic Geology.

An immense amount of work has been performed in this department
during the year. The curator, Mr. Fred. P. Dewey, divides the mate-
rial administered upon and collected during the year into four classes:
(1) those received as accessions in the usual way; (2) those received
from the permanent exhibition in Philadelphia; (5) those received from
the Boston Exhibition, and (4) the material specially collected for dis-
play at the New Orleans Exposition. The collections embraced under
the last head were very numerous and valuabie. <A series of 87 speci-
mens, representing the occurrence of placer gold at most of the promi-
nent regions, was purchased, and is the most full and complete collec-
tion of its kind in the country. The early part of the year was devoted
to administration upon great quautities of material which had been
accumulating for many years, and was stored away in the southwest
court. From this source alone 7,540 new specimens were added to the
collections of the department. Not less than 9,500 specimens have
been placed on exhibition, and the total number of specimens in the
department is estimated at 40,000.

Since July, Mr. Dewey and his staff have been preparing the New
Orleans collection, having an allotment of $5,000 wherewith to illus-
trate the metallic resources of the country, and by the aid of a number
of volunteer assistants in the field the collection has received accessions
of very great value, which make it one of the most valuable metallur-
gical collections in tlfe world.

The organization of the collections in economic geology has con-
sumed a great deal of time. The curator reports that in the develop-
ment of this branch of the department a serious obstacle is presented
by the unwillingness on the part of mine owners to impart such infor-
mation as is necessary in order that the specimens shall attain their
highest value in an educational series.

Mr. Thomas Donaldson has continued the work of cataloguing and
packing the collection of the American Institute of Mining Engineers,
which, having been presented to the Museum, are still in Philadelphia
under his charge.

21. MISCELLANEOUS DEPARTMENTS.
(a) Exploration and field work.

As in previous years the work of exploration and investigations in
the field has been under the immediate auspices of the Smithsonian In-
stitution, and under the special care and direction of the Secretary, who
68 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

has published a full account in his report to the Regents of the Insti-
tution, pages 13-28.

An abstract of this report, giving special references to the additions
made to the collections through the efforts of explorers, is here pre-
sented.

Greenland.—Considering that the whole energy of the Greely Relief
Expedition had to be devoted to the rescue of the Lady Franklin Bay
party, the natural history collections are richer than might have been
expected; the numerous photographs of the country, of the natives,
and the ice, in its various shapes and formations, will be of lasting value.

The physical observations during the course of the expedition were
made part of the regular routine of the vessels. The natural history
work was prosecuted by naval ensigns who had been sent by the Navy
Department to the Smithsonian Institution specially for the purpose of
being trained for such duty. Among these were Messrs. C. A. Harlow,
A. A. Ackerman, and C.8. McClain. These gentlemen had all been
trained at the Institution in the methods of instantaneous photography,
in taxidermy, and in the collecting of minerals and fossils; and although
the time occupied by the expedition was very much less than had been
anticipated, very interesting and desirable collections of rock specimens,
minerals, fossils, numerous birds, and of fishes and marine invertebrates
in alcohol, were made by the gentlemen mentioned.

The Greely Relief Expedition fully and entirely carried out its mis-
sion of restoring the survivors of the Greely party to their friends in
the United States. By far the greater part, however, of the apparatus
and collections made in the several years of absence was left behind at
Fort Conger, and may never be recovered. A few specimens were
brought home by Lieutenant Greely, but have not been received at the
National Museum. .

Labrador.—The reports of 1882 and 1883 give full details of the work
prosecuted by Mr. L. M. Turner at Fort Chimo, Uhgava Bay, in North-
ern Labrador. Mr. Turner’s two years of detail expiring in 1884, he
returned to Washington and is now engaged in preparing his report.
His collections are described by him as consisting :

‘Of birds, 1,800 specimens ; eggs, 1,800 specimens; fishes, 1,000 speci-
mens; mammals, 200 specimens; ethnological, 600 articles; plants, a
great number; insects, over 200,000; geological specimens, a great
variety; Eskimo linguistics, over 500 pages of manuscript, embracing
thousands of words and over 800 sentences, which were obtained dur-
ing the winter nights and at other times when outdoor work could no
be done.” :

Reference was made in a preceding report to the work accomplished
by Dr. C. Hart Merriam in the investigation of the natural history of
the seals of the coast of Labrador; the arrangements made by him in
Newfoundland and Labrador have furnished additional material in the
way of skins and skeletons of several species of seals, the results of
which he has shared with the National Museum,
REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 69

Arctic coast.—Captain Healy and officers of the revenue steamer Cor-
win have supplied collections of minerals, birds, fish, invertebrates, &c.,
from Hotham Inlet and other points along the coast.

Lieut. George M. Stoney, U.S. N., of the schooner Ounalaska, who
had visited Arctic America and explored Hotham Inlet and the rivers
entering into it, obtained an interesting series of rocks from the volcano
in Behring’s Sea. The collections made by him have not, however, yet
come to hand.

Both Captain Healy and Lieutenant Stoney have furnished specimens
of some minerals which were supposed to be jade, but which proved to
be serpentine and green quartzite.

The Pacific Steam Whaling Company established during the year a
depot at Cape Lisburne, with Mr. D. Woolfe in command, for the pur-
pose of mining coal for the use of the whalers, and specimens of this
coal and of the associated fossils have been furnished.

The North Pacific—Reterence was made in a previous report to the
very important work accomplished by Dr. L. Stejneger in Kamtschatka
and the adjacent group of the Commander Islands. Through the cour-
tesy of Governor Grebnitski, in command of these islands, a number of
additional collections were received.

Dr. Stejneger also received from Captain Hunter some skins and
skeletons of the mountain sheep of Kamtschatka.

Alaska.—The Signal Service station at Nushagak, on Bristol Bay, has
been re-established by Mr. J. W. Johnson, from whom a collection of
birds was lately received, which was specially noteworthy as containing
specimens of the Alaska willow wren and of the yellow wagtail, repre-
senting a locality many hundreds of miles further south than Saint
Michael’s, the place of previous record.

Mr. John J. McLean, of the Signal Service, stationed at Sitka, has
secured many ethnological objects of great rarity.

Mr. W. J. Fischer, who is stationed by the Coast Survey at Kodiak,
has used many opportunities both there and in the adjacent regions to
continue his important work; this including much information in re-
gard to the manners and characteristics of the native tribes.

From the Rev. J. Loomis Gould a collection of Indian carvings and
other articles of ethnology was obtained, representing some quite new
forms of aboriginal construction.

Oregon and California. —From Oregon the most noteworthy collec-
tions are those furnished by Capt. Charles Bendire, at Fort Klamath.

The returns from California consist of numerous collections of shells,
minerals, fossils, and archeological objects from Mr. R. E. C. Stearns.

Other specimens are birds from Mr. L. Belging, and fossils from Mr.
C. R. Orcutt.

Mr. Charles H. Townsend, of the United States Fish Commission,
has supplied the most extensive collection of mammals ever received
from California. The collection also embraces numerous skins, skele-
.

70 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

tons, and skulls of sea lions and seals from the Farralone Islands, and
of sea elephants from South California.

Arizona and New Mexico.—These Territories have been well repre-
sented; the former by the mammals, birds, and other objects of interest
furnished by Mr. E. W. Nelson; the latter by an enormous collection
of modern Indian pottery and other articles, made under the auspices
of the Bureau of Ethnology, and others obtained by Mr. James Steven-
son under similar direction.

Some contributions to the fauna of New Mexico were supplied by Dr.
Rh. W. Shufeldt, of the Army, from his station at Fort Wingate.

Bastern portion of the United States—The exploration of the fresh-
water fish fauna of the Mississippi Valley made by Professors Jordan
and Gilbert in behalf of the New Orleans International Exposition is
specially worthy of mention. Several months were occupied in this
service, and many hundreds of species obtained and prepared for exhibi-
tion. Dr. Palmer was detailed to collect the corals of the Florida Keys
and the Tortugas. Henry Hemphill also made collections of the inver-
tebrates of Florida.

The collections of the United States Fish Commission along the east-
ern Coast of the United States have been noteworthy, especially those
from the labors of the Fish Commission steamer Albatross in the
deep waters off the coast.

General collections were made by the Albatross of the Jand fauna of
the coast of the Gulf of Mexico as well as of the marine, resulting in
the addition of a very great number of species to the National Museum,
of which a noted proportion are of scientific interest. Among these
may be mentioned eight new species of birds found on the islands of
Curagoa and Old Providence.

Professor Poey has continued his contributions of fishes from Cuba.

Dr. Nichols, of Dominica, has continued his donations of birds, mol-
lusks, &e., while from Mr. Morris, director of the public gardens and
plantations in Jamaica, many samples of valuable fibers have been
secured.

Mexico and Central America.—Professor Alfred Dugés, of Guanajuato,
Mexico, has continued his transmissions of objects of natural history,
among them being some rare species of birds, &c. Mr. McLeod, of
Jesus Maria, in Mexico, has also furnished some rare birds.

Mr. Romero, the Mexican minister, supplied a series of the playing
eards and other gambling implements of the Mexican Indians.

The services of Louis Aymé, late consul at Merida, were secured to
prosecute some investigations into the ethnology of Yucatan and West-
ern Mexico, especially with a view of showing the relationships between
the habits and manufactures of the Indians of those regions and those
of the southern portion of the United States. Several large collections
have already been received from him, and others of still greater moment
are on the way.

REPORT OF ASSISTANT DIRECTOR. 71

Other collections, especially of birds, from Yucatan have been fur-
nished by Mr. Gaumer. :

Valuable illustrations of the animal and vegetable kingdoms of Gua-
temala and Salvador were secured from the Government Commissioners
of those countries to the foreign exhibition held in Boston in the autumn
of 1883. These, with similar collections under similar auspices obtained
from Venezuela and Brazil, were transferred to the National Museum
early in 1884.

Costa Rica.—Mr. J. C. Zeledon has transmitted specimens of medici-

-nal plants, of birds, of vertebrated animals, and of ethnology.

Mr. R. Iglesias, of Chiriqui, has contributed antiquities and modern
pottery.

South America.—Interesting collections representing the natural prod.
ucts of the animal and vegetable kingdoms of Venezuela and Brazil were
secured from the Governments of Venezuela and Brazil. Dr. William
H. Jones, U. S. N., has contributed some extremely important collee-
tions of the antiquities and natural history of the coast of Peru and
Chili, and to some extent of the Galapagos Islands.

Mr. Kiefer, of Lima, has also made similar contributions.

Professor Nation has sent types of rare and undescribed species of
birds of Peru.

Dr. William Crawford, U. S. N., has contributed some fine shells
from the west coast of Terra del Fnegoand the Straits of Magellan.

The magnificent collection of recent and fossil shells of Europe, be-
longing to Mr. J. Gwyn Jeffries, of London, has been acquired by
the National Museum and in large part received. This is by far the
most valuable private collection of European shells in existence, and
especially important in possessing so many types of the deep-sea spe-
cies dredged in the North Atlantie.

Among contributors to the European collections may be mentioned
the Royal College of Surgeons, the South Kensington Museum, the Brit-
ish Museum, the Royal Botanical Gardens at Kew, in England; the Muse-
ums of Berlin and Dresden, in Germany; of Copenhagen, in Denmark ;
of Bergen, in Norway, &c.

Asia.—The collections from Asia have been of unusual significance
and importance. Reference has been made to the accessions from
Kamtschatka and the Commander Islands obtained through the efforts
of Dr. Stejneger.

Mr. P. L. Jouy has continued his researches in Japan, and bas sup-
plied a large number of species of mammals and birds of that region,
together with other species of animals. The collection of birds being
taken in connection with a series presented by Mr. Thomas Blackiston,
who spent many years in Japan, gives to the National Museum one of
the most complete collections of Japanese birds in existence, and one
greatin value in view of their relationships to the birds of Western
North America.
he REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884,

Rev. C. H. A. Dall has furnished samples of fibers and other nativé
products of the Indies, and the greater part of the exhibit of the For-
eign Exhibition in Boston made by Ceylon has been received; while a
very valuable collection of musical instruments of East India were con-
tributed by the Rajah of Tagore.

Africa.—This country is represented by a few objects of art and in-
dustry, while from New Guinea the collection of weapons, implements,
&¢., obtained from Mr. A. P. Goodwin, has added very greatly to our
representation of that little known island.

The Sandwich Islands.—The greater part of the exhibit made by the
Hawaiian Government at the Boston Foreign Exhibition was secured
and transferred to the National Museum.

(b) Chemistry.

The chemical laboratory of the Smithsonian Institution, which was
for a time transferred to the custody of the Museum, has now been as
such abandoned. The chemical analyses which it is found necessary
to have made in connection with the work of the Museum and the cor-
respondence of the Smithsonian Institution are made under the di-
rection of the chemist of the Geological Survey, Prof. F. W. Clarke,
who occupies laboratories in the northeast pavilion of the Museum
building, and who is authorized by the Director of the Geological Sur-
vey to carry on investigations of this character as a partial return for
the accommodations afforded to the Survey in the Museum building.

(c) Experimental physiology.

Mr. John A. Ryder, embryologist of the United States Fish Commis-
sion, occupies a laboratory in the east wing of the Smithsonian building
and is constantly engaged in physiological and embryological researches
upon material supplied by the Museum and Fish Commission. He may,
therefore, for the present be regarded as the honorary head of this de-
partment, and his numerous contributions to zoological literature are
included in the bibliography of the work of the officers of the Museum.

(ad) Vivaria.

A small collection of living animals is always kept up under the
charge of the chief taxidermist. The collection of aquatic animals at
the Government carp ponds, is still in a flourishing condition.

REPORTS OF THE CURATORS AND ACTING CURATORS OF THE
UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM UPON THE PROGRESS
OF THEIR WORK DURING THE YEAR 1884.

1 (A4).—REPORT ON THE SECTION OF MATERIA MEDICA IN THE
U. $8. NATIONAL MUSEUM, FOR THE YEAR 1884.

By H. G. Bryer, M. D., Assistant Surgeon, U. S. N., Honorary Curator.

Accessions of the year.— Dering the past year specimens of drugs have
been contributed to this department, principally by D. Morris, esq.,
director of Public Gardens and Plantations, Jamaica; Messrs. F, W.
Stearns & Co., Detroit, Mich.; Mr. G. W. Jewett, inspector of drugs,
New York; and Messrs. Fritzsche Bros., New York; numbering in all
406,

Method of arrangement.—W hen specimens are received they are, after
being carefully examined, entered upon the register, and according to
their condition are dried, bottled, and labeled, after which they are added
to the exhibit, which is arranged as follows: First, animal products;
second, vegetable products; third, products of fermentation and dis-
tillation; fourth, inorganic products; the entire collection being pre-
faced by an array of all the “‘medicinal forms” in which medicines are
administered. In addition to the above there is a separate collection
of Chinese materia medica.

Sueceeding the general collection is an exhibit of some of the most
popular mineral waters. Each of these is shown in the quantity of 10
liters, and with it each of its saline constituents, in the exact weight
which analysis has shown to be present in that volume of the water;
thus representing to the eye the quantity of each constituent salt in-
gested with a given quantity of water, and furnishing a quantitative
table, without the use of figures, for comparison of the different mineral
waters.

A catalogue of the collection has been printed, and a classification of
the forms in which drugs are administered, by Dr. James M. Flint, U.S,
N.: also will be found a “ Report on the Pharmacopceais of all Nations,”
by Dr. Flint. No original researches have beén carried on in this De-
partment, owing to the want of necessary apparatus.

Illustrative of drug-yielding plants, there are now properly placed on
exhibition 136 photographs and 350 colored plates.

During the year 1,500 labels have been sent to the printer; at present
893 are permanently attached to specimens.
AOS REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

Condition of the collection.—The following is an accurate statement:

The origin of this collection dates to 1882, when the Agricultural De-
partment transferred to this institution the several collections of drugs
which were exhibited at the International Exhibition, Philadelphia,
1876. It has, through the kindness of the wholesale drug firms of
W. H. Schieffelin & Co., N. Y.; Parke, Davis & Co., Detroit, Mich.; Mec-
Kesson & Robbins, N. Y.; Wallace Bros., Statesville, N. C., and others,
together with exchanges with foreign museums, grown to be one of the
largest of its kind.

The object of such a collection is to exhibit drugs in their crude state,
and the different preparations of them, and thus serve to illustrate to
what stage of perfection man has arrived in the use of medicines.

The collection at present as a whole already represents the principal
drugs in most of their commercial varieties now in use by the civilized
people of the world, including nearly all of the new remedies that have
lately been brought to the notice of the profession. Therefore the prog-
ress of the future development of this collection of the Museum can per-
haps hardly be expected to be as rapid as it has been in the past, for
the majority of acquisitions will be found to consist of duplicates.

The labelling of the collection, which heretofore has been the most
important routine work, has offered many serious difficulties. The prin-
cipal ones may be plainly traced to two sources, viz: First, the difficulty
of judiciously and carefully condensing information when such is found
in abundance, so that it will only occupy the limited space allowed for
each label by the Museum regulations, keeping in constant view the
double end of the exhibit, which is that of a popular exhibition for the
information of the general visitor as well as a scientific collection and
arrangement of facts for the pharmaceutical and medical student. Sec-
ondly, the obscure drugs of which either very little is known or, at any
rate, information is very imperfect. The labelling of the entire collec-
tion, which has been zealously pursued, will probably be finished during
the first part of 1885.

Recommendations for future work.—It now remains to extend the use-
fulness and importance of this section of the Museum in a direction
which, from the natural course of events, it must go to bring it up to
the prestige of that scientific institution of which, in time to come, it
will, it is to be hoped, form a most important part.

Plant analysis and pharmacological experiments, or the investigation
of the chemical constituents of plants and their action on the animal
organism, call loudly for a recognition denied them. For the last twenty
years but little has been accomplished in this line of research. Instead of
taking, as it ought, a foremost place, on account of the immediate practi-
1 ieee ea Pe

SECTION OF MATERIA MEDICA. 77

cal importance attached to its beneficial results applicable to mankind,
it has lagged far behind its sister sciences, physiology and pathology.
However, within the last few years it has received a new impetus.
Some of our transatlantic colleagues are devoting themselves assidu-
ously to the study of drugs and their actions. The discovery of the
anesthetic properties of cocainum chloridum is a more recent example
of their success. In connection with this department it is of the highest
importance that such researches should be carried on. The medical
profession of this country would watch our operations with great ap-
proval and profound interest, and the raison d@’étre of this section of the
United States National Museum would be proportionally increased. I
would therefore respectfully and earnestly urge the necessity of provid-
ing the means for investigating this valuable stock of material now
contained in the collection.

I (B).—REPORT ON SECTION OF TEXTILE INDUSTRIES IN THE
U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

By Romyn Hircucock, Acting Curator.

The collection of textile fibers and fabrics was placed under my charge
in November, 1883, at which time there was a large accumulation of ma-
terial in the Museum pertaining to this department, which was stowed
away in drawers and boxes. Much of this material was of value, some
of it worthless, and it required no little labor to classify and arrange it
for display. When this work was.begun there was scarcely a single
case of textiles on exhibition properly arrranged and labelled. There
are now not less than thirty sliding-screen cases completely filled with
specimens, each one of which is labelled either with a permanent printed,
or a temporary written, label. By far the greater number of these have
been mounted during the year 1884. In the beginning of work in this
department many difficulties were encountered. It was necessary, first
of all, to devise a system of classification for fibers and fabrics which
would be comprehensive. As regards vegetable fibers, various systems
were considered, in the hope that a scientific classification might be
found which would serve well for industrial purposes ; but a brief study
of the subject clearly showed the impracticability of such a scheme:
Turning then to purely artificial systems, it is not necessary to refer to
the merits and demerits of those which have been proposed from time
to time, but merely to say that the system which has seemed best for
museum purposes is based upon the position of the fibers in the plants.
The plan of classification adopted for textile fibers is as follows:

80 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

Far greater difficulty has been found in classifying textile fabrics,
owing to the technical knowledge of the methods of manufacture re-
quired to do this work in a satisfactory manner. No system has yet
_ been perfected, although a general plan has been under consideration
for some time, and it will doubtless be possible to outline a satisfactory
scheme in the course of another year. Meanwhile specimens are being
mounted, described, and arranged in the cases according to a provisional
classification, based primarily upon their composition (whether of cotton,
flax, wool, silk, &c.), and secondly upon the method of weaving.

Accessions of the year.—The following are the most important among
the additions to the collections for the year 1884:

Twenty-two specimens of jute, grown in Mississippi from seed ob-
tained in India, showing various qualities of the fiber in different stages
of preparation. From Hon. W. W. Stone, Stoneville, Miss., president
Delta Jute and Fiber Company.

Six specimens, showing the process of manufacturing gunny cloth
from Calcutta jute butts. From Mr. Appleton Sturgis, New York.

A large collection of cordage made of jute, and a fine specimen of
jute fiber, from the Schlichter Jute Cordage Company, Philadelphia, Pa.

Forty specimens of textile fibers and fabrics of various kinds from
different countries, all well named and identified. From the Royal
Botanical Gardens, Kew,. England.

A collection of machine-made laces of various kinds, Face mits, nubias,
&ec. From A. G. Jennings & Sons, New York.

A large number of textile fibers and fabrics, from Guatemala and San
Salvador, received from the Boston Foreign Exposition, of 1883.

Thirteen specimens of textile fibers from Jamaica, collected by Mr. V.
P. Parkhurst, who was engaged as collector on the occasion of a visit to
the West Indies.

Twenty-nine specimens of English laces, made in Nottingham and
Devonshire, England, a list of which will be found in No. 24 of the
“Proceedings” of the Museum. From Mr. A. Robertson, with Messrs.
Hitchcock, Williams & Co., London.

Twenty-two small samples of English silk fabrics, manufactured in
Manehester and Bradford, and one hundred similar samples of cotton
and worsted fabrics, etc. Also from Mr. A. Robertson.

A fine specimen of Jacquard weaving in silk. From Prof. T. C.
Archer, director of the Edinburgh Museum.

Nine specimens illustrating the manufacture of hand-made ingrain
and rag carpets. From Mr. O. Herring, Maryland Mills, Baltimore,
Md.

Thirty-seven specimens of rope and twine made of American, Russian,
and Italian hemp and sisal. From J. T. Bailey & Co., Philadelphia.

A series of fifteen specimens of flax and flax twines manufactured at
Schagticoke, N. Y., from flax grown in New York State, From Mr. EB,
W, Hartshorn, president Cable Flax Mills.
Fl Na) i ee

SECTION OF TEXTILE INDUSTRIES, 81

Twelve specimens of rough and hackled flax, French, Irish, Dutch,
and Canadian. From the Barbour Flax Spinning Company, Paterson,
N. J.

A series of thirty-seven specimens illustrating the manufacture of raw
silk fabries in the United States. This collection begins with the raw silk
as imported from Italy, Japan, and China, and shows the various stages
in the preparation of the silk forthe loom. The series is an interesting
one because the successive steps in the manufacture are so well shown.
Then follow specimens of the finished goods, plain or brocaded, in con-
siderable variety. Received from John N. Stearns & Co., of New York.

Fifteen specimens of raw silks, as imported from Lombardy, Ce-
vennes, Piedmont, Japan, and China, carefully selected as_ typical
samples, and presented by C. Adolphe Low & Co., of New York.

Seven specimens of tapestry Brussels carpets. From the Roxbury
Carpet Company, Boston, Mass.

Specimens of “‘ Napier matting” and “ hemp carpetings” made of jute.
From the Dolphin Manufacturing Company, New York.

Specimens of Yucca brevifolia and various kinds of paper made there-
from. From R. E. C. Stearns, Washington, D. C.

Fifteen specimens of fibers, mostly of animal origin. From the cus-
tom-house, Boston, Mass.

A set of specimens of knit worsted fabrics, astrachan, Jersey cloth,
stockinette cloth, &c., manufactured in Philadelphia. From John E.
Hanifen & Co., Philadelphia, Pa.

A very valuable collection of 117 specimens, illustrating the manu-
facture of worsted yarns used in the goods made by the Arlington Mills,
and specimens of fine cotton yarns made at the same mills. This is a
collection worthy of more than a passing notice. It was prepared with
great care and judgment by the superintendent of the mills, Mr. W. D.
Hartshorne, for the purpose of showing the successive stages in the
manufacture of yarns from wools of different grades. Beginning with
a certain grade of wool the process is followed from the greasy wool
through the preparers, combs, gill-boxes, etc., and made into tops. The
manufacture of colored top from the same grade of wool is likewise
fully illustrated by samples of fine Australian wool in successive stages
from greasy wool through the scourer, carder, back-washing, gill-boxes,
comb, and finishing gill-boxes. Then specimens of tops of various
grades are shown, and the processes of reducing top to yarn are illus-
trated by three distinct series of specimens representing three different
grades of wool. Then follow numerous samples of yarns.

An equally complete and more comprehensive series of specimens
illustrating the manufacture of worsted and cotton yarns, and also of
the finished fabrics and the process of calico printing has been received
from the Pacific Mills, and will soon be mounted for exhibition in the
Museum. This collection likewise begins with the wool in the grease.
Six varieties and mixtures of wool are represented by large samples,

5. Mis, 33, pt. 2 6

82 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

and these are each carried through the successive stages of manufact-
ure, washing, carding, combing, etc., to the finished yarn.

The manufacture of cotton yarn is likewise illustrated, two grades
being carried through the various ‘operations in parallel series, the
specimens being carefully chosen to represent the processes as com-
pletely as possible.

Calico printing is illustrated by specimens of cloth before and after
bleaching, after printing, with color set, and finished. There is also a
copper print-roller, taken from the machine, and the process is still
more fully illustrated by photographs taken at the mills by the acting
curator on the occasion of his visit during the summer.

There is also a fine set of samples of cotton goods, worsteds, and de-
laines, representing the large variety of fabrics manufactured by the
Pacific Mills.

The manufacture of woolen goods, fancy cassimeres, etc., is repre-

sented by two collections, the first from the Harris Woolen Company,

of Woonsocket, R. [., which begins with the raw wool, and a few sam-
ples showing the material in the course of preparation and spinning
into yarn. Then follow specimens of worsted fabrics and wool-mixed
dress goods. Another collection from the Lippitt Woolen Company,
also of Woonsocket, embraces a variety of fancy cassimeres. Both
these collections will soon be on exhibition in the Museum.

A series of sixteen specimens of fabrics of English manufacture, in-
cluding such as seal-cloth and astrachan, was presented by Mr. H.
Herrman, of the firm of Herrman, Sternbach & Company, of New

~York. These specimens, valuable in themselves, are worthy of especial
mention because of the information concerning the methods of manu-
facture which accompanied them.

The manufacture of ginghams is represented by a good collection
from the Whittenton Manufacturing Company, Taunton, Mass., em-
bracing a considerable variety of cotton fabrics, plaids, cotton cassi-
meres and tweeds, fancy shirtings, tickings, ete.

An interesting collection, illustrating the manufacture of hair-cloth
from horse-hair has been received from the Pawtucket Hair-cloth Com-
pany. This shows the rough hair as it is received in bales from South
America and Siberia, the hackled hair, curled hair, hair prepared for
the loom, and samples of the woven cloth.

A valuable set of specimens has been received from the Bigelow Car-
pet Company, illustrating the manufacture of Brussels and Wilton ear-
pets. Beginning with the carpet-wools employed, the manufacture of
yarns is first illustrated by specimens of washed wool, slivers, noils,
roping, and dyed yarns. Then follow specimens of carpets and borders,
in Brussels and veivet carpets.

The foregoing collection is supplemented by some specimens of car-
pets of the same kind from the Lowell Manufacturing Company, which
includes also ingrain carpets of the same manufacture.

Sr
i SECTION OF TEXTILE INDUSTRIES. 83

The Roxbury Carpet Company has presented some fine specimens of
tapestry Brussels carpets, thus making the collection to illustrate car-
pet manufacture quite comprehensive.

A perfect working model of the original cotton-gin invented by Eli
Whitney has been received from his son, Eli Whitney, of New Haven,
and is on exhibition in the Museum.

The routine work of the year.—The work of the acting curator con-
sists in obtaining and selecting material for exhibition, classifying and
arranging it for the cases, collecting information about textile industries
generally, and applying such information to the preparation of labels
for the spectmens. During the year work of this kind has been greatly
facilitated by the means afforded for visiting mills in the East as col-
lector for the New Orleans Exposition. Through the courtesy of treas-
urers and superintendents of several of the largest mills the writer
was enabled to spend much time in studying the processes of spinning
and weaving, with great advantage to the work in the Museum. At
the same time photographs were taken of machinery in use, which are
of great value in illustrating the processes as they are described on the
labels in the Museum.

For special courtesies of this nature the Museum is indebted to Mr.
H. Saltonstall, treasurer of the Pacific Mills, Mr. W. Whitman, treas-
urer of the Arlington Mills, Mr. C. Fairbanks, treasurer of the Bigelow
Carpet Company, and to various other firms and individuals whose
mills were visited with interest and benefit.

An important part of the curator’s duty is to make microscopical
investigations of fibers of all kinds, with reference to their value for
various purposes, and particularly as to their adaptability to textile
purposes. It has been impossible to conduct any systematic work of
this kind during the past year, owing to the want of time, and the
microscope has only been used occasionally for the purpose of identify-
ing specimens. It will be necessary, however, to employ the micro-
scope more frequently in future, for the work will require it.

But little attention has been given to any but the exhibition series
of specimens during this year. It is doubtful if a comprehensive study
series would be of value in the Museum. A set of fibers of all kinds
and from different localities, that can be always accessible for examina-
tion, is, however, very desirable, if not absolutely necessary, and it is
intended to prepare such a series without delay.

The microscopical appearance of the more important textile fibers
will be shown by means of photographs from the microscope in con-
nection with the fibers themselves as soon as time permits. To this
end, some preparations were mounted for microscopical examination
by Mr. Harry English, during his connection with the Museum, and it
is expected they will yield fine photographs.

Researches.—No original investigations have been conducted in this
department, the routine work demanding all the time to the exclusion
84 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

of other interests. A list of the vegetable fibers in the collection was
published in No. 24 of the ‘* Proceedings” of the Museum, but since this
was prepared the collection has largely increased.

A complete list of vegetable textile fibers, with common, local, and
botanical names, alphabetically arranged, is in course of preparation,
but it will not be published for a year or more. This list will give also
the classification of the fibers according to the system adopted in the
Museum.

Present state of collection——During the year 1883 our Smithsonian
collection specimens have been catalogued. All of these are not, how-
ever, desirable for exhibition purposes. There are now on exhibition,
approximately, 2,000 specimens.

The number of duplicates and of specimens in the study series cannot
be satisfactorily estimated at this time.

Recommendations and remarks.—To increase the interest of the collec-
tions, to make them more instructive and intelligible, it seems desirable
to make use of photography to illustrate the textile industries, even to
as great an extent as has been done already in illustrating the fisheries.
What little has been done has enabled the curator to judge as to the
value and practicability of such a scheme, and since it does not involve
the employment of a photographer, but only some additional work on
his own part, it is recommended that every facility should be given to
carry out the scheme in a satisfactory manner. The plan advised, tak-
ing the subject of cotton for example, is to begin with the cotton in the
field and follow it through its entire commercial history by photographic
representations of the picking, ginning, baling, shipping, and handling
until it reaches the mills. There it is also followed through the various
machines, until it is finally photographed in the piles of woven fabrics
in the warehouse ready for market.

One great want which is severely felt in this department is that of
books of reference regarding textiles.
I fe),—REPORT ON THE SECTION OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE OF
THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM FOR 1884,

By JoserH W. Couns, Honorary Curator.

REVIEW OF IMPORTANT ADDITIONS DURING THE YEAR.

The number of accessions during the year, both of models, full-sized
boats, and boat and vessel equipments, has been large, and. generally
of an important and interesting ‘character. A considerable portion of
these accessions was collected for exhibition at the International
Fisheries Exhibition held in London in 1883, where also many very in-
teresting and valuable objects were obtained, some by exchange with
other countries, while others were presented to the Museum. Although
these collections of American craft and their equipmént were made in
1882 and 1883, and the exchanges and donations received from the Lon-
don Exhibition were made prior to the close of the past year, the various
objects did not reach this country until after the close of the exposition,
and become available to the Museum until after the beginning of 1884.
We therefore feel justified, while preparing this, the first annual report
of this department, in considering all the material gathered in 1882,
18835, and 1884 as coming under the head of the accessions for the pres-
ent year. Elsewhere the general character of the material gathered,
and its relation to the present condition of the collection, will be more
fully discussed. Here it is proposed to give only a review of the more
important additions to the collection, with such notes as may be deemed
desirable to show from what sources they were obtained, as well as to
give an idea of their value and importance.

There have been-collected in the period above named, 1882 to 1884,
inclusive, 123 models and full-sized specimens of vessels and boats of
North America, chiefly, however, such as are used in the United States;
30 models and full-sized specimens of foreign fishing boats; 12 large
India-ink and. crayon sketches (30 by 40 inches) of American fishing
boats; 92 photographs of fishing craft of the United States: 4 water-
color sketches of vessels of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth
centuries; 8 photographic negatives of merchant vessels of the United
States in the period between 1805 and 1845; 1 water-color sketch of a
merchant bark of 1844; 1 photographic negative of a naval battle, war

86 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

of 181215; 5 oil paintings of modern vessels; 1 sketch and 2 prints of
vessels; 1 model of a life-car; and 165 accessions of boat-building mate-
rial and boat fittings. Many of these last accessions, though mentioned
under a single number, contain a dozen or more objects which make up
a complete set.

The following objects may be alluded to as being of the greatest im-
portance among the accessions to this department:

(1) A collection of 4 rigged models, a fishing ketch, chebacco boat,
pinkie, and square stern Marblehead banker, showing the early forms
of vessels used in the fisheries of this country from its settlement up to,
and including, the first quarter of the present century. These are espe-
cially interesting, not only as an illustration of certain degrees of evolu-
tion in the form of fishing vessels, but also to show the peculiarities of
the schooner, rigged in its more primitive form, after it was first invented
at Gloucester, Mass.

. (2) A series of builders’ modeler illustrating the changes in the form
of fishing vessels, from 1835 down to the extreme clipper of the present
day. This collection is divided into three groups: one illustrating the
development of the cod-fishing schooner, or Grand Banker, which is
generally somewhat fuller than other fishing vessels; a second group
showing the changes made in the “‘ medium-sharp ” type, and the other
group is composed of models which were the extreme sharp vessels of
the several periods when they were built.

(3) A sectional model of the schooner “ Gertie Evelyn,” of Gloucester,
Mass., which illustrates very fully the interior arrangements of a modern
fishing schooner. In my opinion no object in the collection under my
charge is more instructive than this.*

(4) A rigged model of a three-masted cod-fishing schooner, such as
are now used from some of the New England ports, and which are the
largest vessels employed in the food fisheries on the Atlantic coast.

(5) A builder’s model, mounted in medallion, of an ideal fishing schooner,
made deeper and somewhat narrower than the average New England
schooner, and designed to secure greater safety in rough weather, par-
ticularly when employed in the winter fisheries. This model is of especial
interest at the present time, since it is believed by competent authority
that a very considerable percentage of the losses of life and property —
which so frequently occur in the fishing fleets of New England, might
be obviated by the employment of vessels of greater depth than those
now inuse. A fruitful source of disaster is doubtless the liability of the
present type of schooner to capsize or to be tripped by a heavy sea, and
its inability to right again, owing to the lack of a low center of gravity,
which only depth can give, and an unusual length and weight of spars.t

(6) A series of 22 models of fishing boats, canoes, dugouts, &e., used
in the United States, both by aboriginal and white fishermen. This
collection has been drawn from various sources, but more particularly
from Alaska, and from the Atlantie coast, between Eastern Maine and
Washington, D.C. It is of especial interest, as, combined with other
material of a similar nature previously acquired by the Museum, it
makes up a collection representing nearly all of the more important
types of the smaller fishing craft used in the United States and its Ter-
ritories. The greater part of this collection has been purchased, though
in this as with other material, the Museum has been the recipient of
numerous donations.

(7) A collection of 4 full-sized fishing boats and 10 models of fishing
craft of the East Indies has been presented to the Museum by Sur-
geon-General Francis Day, F. L. 8., late inspector of Her Majesty’s
fisheries in India, and commissioner from India to the International
Fisheries Exhibition at London, 1883. This is an exceedingly interest-
ing collection, and without question it may be safely asserted that it
forms one of the most valuable accessions received by this department
of the Museum during the current year. Almost every specimen of
either full-sized boats or models shows some interesting peculiarity,
which, if space and time permitted, would merit a longer notice than we
are able to give it here. <A brief mention of them must suffice. Perhaps
the most interesting of the various forms is that of a full-sized dugout
used at Patna, in Bengal, where it is locally known as the “etka.” This_
boat is made from the stem of the semul tree (Bombax malabaricum), and
is very primitive in its construction, being, in fact, simply a large, elon-
gated, trough-shaped canoe, unlike any other in the large collection of
dugouts in the Museum.

Another very unique type of fishing boat, and perhaps one of the most
peculiar dugout canoes used by man, comes from Jessor, in Bengal,
where it is locally known as a “donga.” This is constructed from the
stem of the tar palm tree (Borassus flabelliformis), the hard outer layer
of which, after the soft portion is scooped out, is very serviceable for
this purpose. It has much the appearance of an exaggerated spoon,
with a deep bowl and a large handle, the latter concaved on one side
and convexed on the other, its end stopped or rendered water-tight by
a partition placed crosswise. The shape of the boat is due to the pecu-
liar growth of the stem of the tar palm, which swells out into a rounded
bulb-like form at one end. When it is said that the length of this ecu-
rious boat is less than 13 feet, and that it is only 30 inches wide in its
broadest part and does not average more than a foot in width for about
two-thirds of its length, one will be fully able not only to appreciate the
manner in whick man adapts means to ends to provide himself with
some sort of craft for carrying on his operations, but will also be able
to understand that a considerable degree of skill is required to navigate
a boat of this kind,
88 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

A full-sized catamaran (13 feet long and 3 feet wide), such as is used
for fishing in the Presidency of Madras, is another very interesting ad-
dition to the collection of primitive types of water craft. Rudely con-
structed of logs, and apparently as illy adapted as anything well can be
for encountering rough water, craft of this kind are nevertheless said to
be very serviceable for crossing a heavy surf, and it is stated that they
will make a landing in breakers which would prove the destruction of
any ordinary boat that should dare to make a similar attempt. It is
said that these rafts rise lightly over an ordinary surf, but if caught by
a great breaker are overwhelmed and knocked about. t such times
the natives, who are semi-amphibious in their habits, will leap over-
board, and after their vessel has passed the surf they will clamber on
to her again, and go on as if nothing had happened. |

Among the models of East Indian boats there is a very remarkable
one of a fishing craft used at Chittagong, in the Presidency of Bengal.
This is a long and narrow dugout canoe with scoop-shaped, narrow,
square ends. Its special peculiarity consists in an arrangement for
catching fish automatically. On one side of the boatis a broad bamboo
platform, fixed to the gunwale in such a manner that it projects out
into the water, and to this is attached a string of palm leaves something
in the form of a broom. This strange device, when slightly agitated
by the motion of the boat, has the effect of frightening any fish that
may be near and which immediately jump upon the half submerged
bamboo platform, and thence into the boat, where they fall among the
branches of trees with which the canoe’s bottom is strewn. ‘The fish-
erman sits on the gunwale with one foot in the water and heels the
craft to the proper angle, or gives it the requisite motion for frightening
the fish. To prevent the fish from Jeaping over the other side of the
boat, and thus regaining their liberty, a net is fixed obliquely or ver-
tically along the opposite gunwale, and serves as an effectual barrier to
their escape.

The most interesting model, perhaps, which has been received in this

collection of Indian water craft, is that of the Bombay fishing boat .

known as the ‘“‘machva” in the region where it is used. No boat in
the world is more distinctive in type than this, and there are, perhaps,
few others which would sooner attract the attention of those who are
familiar with vessels. In the shape of its bottom the ‘‘machva” differs
from all other boats, and the peculiar form of its keel is seemingly at
variance with all of the recognized rules of naval architecture. Thekeel
curves upwards in the center in an arch-like shape, and is deepest at
the bow, where it forms nearly a right angle with the straight raking
stem; it also drops down aft considerably. This boat, which is carvel
built, of teak, has a long, sharp, scoop-shaped bow, resembling in its
form the forward section of an Arab dhow. The deep projecting keel
serves the same purpose as a double center-board for providing the
requisite lateral resistance when the boat is sailing close hauled. The
SECTION OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE. 89

rig consists of a single short, stout mast, stepped almost amidships,
and having a strong rake forward. Upon this is spread a large settee
sail, which taeks down to the bow.

The “machva” is credited with being the swiftest of Indian sailing
craft, and a claim has been made that boats of this type could beat
English yachts. Dr. McDonald, secretary and curator of the Victoria
and Albert Museum, Bombay, says, “ The fishing boats of the Konkan
are considered to be amongst the swiftest sailing vessels known.” It is
believed by the native fishermen that the sailing qualities of their boats
are materially improved by the shape of the keel. It would appear,
too, that they are correct, strange as it may seem, for Biddle, in his
“Model Yacht Building and Sailing,” tells us that “* some experiments
were tried with this type of vessel a few years back. The arch was
filled up and the sailing qualities of the craft immediately destroyed.”
He also says “ They do not go to windward so well as an English yacht,
but in running and reaching they cannot be surpassed, especially in
smooth water.” Dixon Kemp, however, in “ Yacht and Boat Sailing”
(4th edition, p. 350), expresses the opinion that the stories about such
craft beating boats of English design must be taken with considerable
allowance.

The following interesting account of the ceremonies attending the
launching of a new boat of this class is given by Dr. McDonald:
‘“ When a Koli builds a new boat, or ‘machva,’ he gives a dinner to
his friends and relatives on the occasion of its being first launched.
The fermented juice of the palm tree is freely drunk by the guests in-
vited on such occasions. The women, too, honor new boats with rev-
erence and break cocoanuts upon the boat’s bows, pretty much as cham-
pagne bottles are broke at home on like occasions.”

Other models in this collection of East Indian boats, particularly the
Madras “ masulah” boat, and two of those used at the Maldives and
Aden, are interesting as showing the peculiar method of sewing the
planks together with coir twine, which is a characteristic feature of
many of the fishing craft used by the natives of the East.

(8) We have obtained from the Government of Greece a collection
of the fishing boats of that country, consisting of one full-sized speci-
men and two models. It is interesting to note that two of these boats,
a fishing skiff, and a sloop from the island of Sciathos, resemble craft
used in the United States. For instance, the skiff might be easily taken
for one used by gunners in the Chesapeake and its tributaries, while on
the New England coast sloop boats could perhaps be found which
would not be very much unlike that employed by the Grecian fisher-
men. The most interesting model in this collection is that of a Grecian
boat employed in the net and seine fisheries. It is sharp aft, and finely
proportioned. Its striking peculiarity, however, is a projecting cut-
water or ‘‘ram”, which seams to be the last surviving relic in the
Grecian boats of the “ram’s head,” or cut-water, which adorned the
90 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

bows of the ancient triremes, and which on the latter was used for offen-
sive purposes (like the projecting rams on modern men-of-war), for crush-
ing the sides of their antagonists. This boat is propelled wholly with
oars, having eight rowers on a side.

(9) A collection of seven fine models of Chinese cargo boats and fish-
ing craft has been obtained from the Museum of Fish Culture at South
Kensington, London. These models are a valuable acquisition to the
Museum, and combined with others previously acquired make up an
interesting collection representing the craft of the Celestial Empire. It
is possible in this place to make special mention of only two of the
models as being of peculiar interest. One of these, a so-called ‘ out-
rigged” fishing junk, from South Formosa, is a remarkably clumsy
craft, even for a Chinese junk, and judging by descriptions that have
been given, it is probably a fact that this style of vessel has not changed
much in its form or in the method of its construction since the days of
Marco Polo. The other is a bamboo raft, or catamaran, a style of boat
employed in China as elsewhere (in South America and India) not only
for fishing purposes, but to go on and off the coast when the surf is so
heavy as to preclude the possibility of using the ordinary form of boat.

(10) A full-sized dugout cance, such as is used on the Gold Coast of
Africa, has been presented to the Museum by Mr. Maloney, governor
of the Gold Coast colony. As being the only full-sized representative
we have of water craft used by the natives of Africa, this canoe is of
especial interest and value to the collection. It also has an additional
importance from being another interesting accession to the collection
of primitive boats used by man, particularly of those which come under
the head of dugout canoes.

(11) An Irish “ curragh,” exhibited at the London Fisheries Exhibi-
tion, has been presented by the Marquis of Hamilton. This boat, made
of tarred canvas stretched over a light frame-work of willow withes, is
probably the most primitive form of water craft used by civilized man,
and it constitutes an interesting “connecting link,” if we may so call it,
between the boats of a remote age and the higher types of vessels in
use at the present day. Remarkable as it may seem, craft of this kind
are still in common use for fishing purposes on the west coast of Lre-
land, and are perhaps as fine an illustration of the adaptation of means
to ends as can be found even among the varying forms of boats used
by savage tribes; for here the poor fisherman, not able to afford the
expense of building a more durable craft, with the limited means at his
command, makes himself such an one as may answer his purpose.
Though extremely frail in appearance, these craft, from their lightness,
are very buoyant, and it is said of them that they will rise like.a feather
upon waves which would prove troublesome, if not dangerous, to the
ordinary fishing boat.

(12) Two full-sized British “ corracles,” one from the river Boyne in
Ireland, and the other from the river Dee in Scotland, which have been
SECTION OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE. 91

obtained by exchange, may be reckoned among the valuable addi-
tions to our collection in this department. These are oval-shaped boats
about 55 feet long and two-thirds as wide, the depth being about 18
inches. The Boyne corracle is made of leather, fastened to a basket-
like frame of willow withes, while the Scotch corracle is constructed of
breadths of tarred canvas drawn over a light framework of thin, flat,
wooden strips. Each of these corracles has a single thwart, placed
nearly amidships, upon which the occupant sits to paddle the boat.

(13) Among the interesting novelties received by the Museum during -
the current year might properly be included a model of a Belgian fish-
ing sloop, which was purchased at the International Fisheries Exhibi-
tion at London, and which represents the peculiar style of boats used
for beam-trawling, &e., from certain ports on the coast of Belgium, but
particularly from Heyst and Blankenberghe. This boat, which is de-
signed for landing on a beach, and is, therefore, flat-bottomed, and like
the Dutch bomschuited, very broad and full, differs, in the form of its
hull and its rig, from any other fishing boat used by man at the present
time. This model is rendered doubly interesting by having attached
to it the peculiar forms of fishing apparatus used by the Belgiaa boats,
and also because there are a number of figures of fishermen in it.

(14) The collection has been enriched by an accession of four water-
color sketches of ships of the fifteenth, sixteenth, and seventeenth
centuries, which are of especial interest as being connected with the
early history of America. One of the sketches represents the ships of
Columbus, according to the highest French authority, which by the
closest students of naval architeeture of that period are believed to
be the most accurate and reliable. Another very interesting sketch
is that of the Mayflower under sail, on her passage from England to
America in 1620. This is probably the most accurate sketch of the
Mayflower that has ever been made, since it is derived from a study
of many years of the various peculiarities of the English and Dutch
vessels of that period. A third sketch represents a “carrack” of the
sixteenth century. Hippus, the Tyrian, is credited with having first
devised carracks, which are described as vessels of great size, de-
signed for both trade and war. The same name was given also by the
Portuguese and Spanish to a class of vessels which they sent in the
sixteenth century to the East Indies and Brazil, and which doubtless
visited other parts of America. These vessels were large and full, of
great depth, and were designed for fighting as well as trade. The
fourth sketch is that of a Spanish “ galleon” of the sixteenth century
(1520). In their traffic with America, galleons were much used by the
Spanish as treasure ships during the sixtgenth century. They were
always heavily armed, but it is said that owing to their unwieldiness
they generally fell an easy prey to their assailants.

(15) D. J. Lawlor, naval architect, Chelsea, Mass., has presented the
Museum with a fine collection of 17 models of various styles of vessels,
92 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

Among these may be mentioned, as of especial interest, 8 models which
show the evolution of the American pilot-boat from 1845 down to
October, 1884. In no department of naval architecture have our ship-
builders shown more originality than in the construction of pilot-boats,
and perhaps nowhere else, either in this or other countries, has there
been a higher combination of speed and general sea-going qualities than
has been characteristic of the vessels of this class employed on our
Atlantic coast. In this collection, perhaps, more than in any other that
might be gathered, are illustrated the ideas which have influenced the
minds of designers of small, swift, sea-going sailing vessels during the
past forty years. Passing through various changes of greater or less
importance, the writer is of the opinion that, in the model of the pilot-
boat Hesper, of Boston, very high results have beep attained, so far
as a combination of speed, symmetry, and sea-worthiness is concerned.

Another model in the collection obtained from Mr. Lawlor is that of
the steamship Meteor, which has a very interesting history. She was
built by subscription from merchants of Boston, New York, and elsewhere
“for the purpose of offering her to our Government for the pursuit of the
Alabama and other blockade runners, then preying upon our commerce
and carrying stores to the enemy, in defiance of our more heavily armed
ships of war.”* The design for this ship was offered in competition, the
competitors being Henry and William H. Webb, of New York, and D. J.
Lawlor, of Chelsea, Mass. One hundred dollars bonus was offered as a
prize to him whose design was accepted. The model made by Mr. Lawlor,
and which he has presented to the Musemn, is the one which was accepted,
and from this the ship was built at Portsmouth, N. H., and launched on
May 21,1864. ‘She was designed to carry one heavy pivot amidships on
gun deck, or two 10-inch or other guns at the same point, namely, just
before the mainmast; forward of this are four ports (two on each side)
where 8 or 9-inch Dahlgrens would have been mounted had she been
taken by the United States Navy Department, and abreast of the engine
hatch aft there are two ports on each side where she could have mounted
short 32’s or 24-pound howitzers, and on the upper deck are beds for
two 30-pound Parrotts, making one pivot 11 inch, or two 10 inch; four
broadside, 8 or 9 inch; four 32 or 24-pound howitzers, on gun deck;
two light chase guns on upper deck. She has two 624 by 36-inch cylin-
ders; four tubular boilers; propeller of brass, 133 feet diameter and 23
feet pitch. The motive power, boilers, &c., were imported from Scot-
land at a very large cost.” t

‘“The Meteor was a steamer of 1,440 tons register, old measurement,
being about 400 tons larger than the Alabama; and when tested by the

Navy Department made the best time between the trial buoys off Sandy
Hook which had then ever been made by any screw ship, being one or
two miles an hour faster than any of the rebel cruisers; but just when
the Government was about taking her, the fall of Fort Fisher rendered
her no longer necessary for her original purpose, and, after two or three
voyages in the transport and merchant service, she was laid up and
offered for sale in New York in the summer of 1865.

“In the autumn of 1865 Spain made war upon her former colonies,
the states of Chili and Peru, whose independence she had never formally
acknowledged, and it soon became known that the South American
Republic wanted ships.

“There was every reason why the owners of the Meteor should be
ready to sell her to our South American neighbors whenever they could
properly and lawfully do so.”*

Negotiations were carried on with this purpose in view, but when all
ready to sail with her stores and crew on board, “the Meteor was
seized on the 23d of January, 1866, by the United States marshal, at
the instance of Spain,” and for about two years was held in litigation
by the Government of the United States for alleged infringement of
neutrality laws, the final result of the suit, however, being in favor of
the owners of the ship.

Outside of the purpose for which she was originally built the model
of the Meteor is interesting as being a ship of unusual speed for the
period when she was designed. It is related of her that she has made
an average speed of 154 knots an hour, with a disconnected screw, for
a period of 72 consecutive hours.

In the collection received from Mr. Lawlor are two fine models of
steam yachts, which illustrate the advance which has been made in
designing these types of pleasure craft.

(16) In a collection of 5 models of various kinds of sailing and steam
craft, presented to the Museum by Sumner, Swaysey, and Currier, of
Newburyport, Mass., is an interesting model of the screw steam packet .
Decatur, built about 1844, and which may be considered as a fair rep-
resentative type of the earliest fgrms of screw steamers employed in the
United States.

(17) We have received from John N. Cushing, of Newburyport, Mass.,
a collection of 8 models of merchant vessels (brigs, barks, and ships).
Of these two are of especial interest. One of them is the model of the
brig Palos, of Newburyport, built in 1832. From this model, which
is one of the best examples extant of the old-style “ kettle-bottom,” a
fleet of 12 or 14 brigs were built, these being employed chiefly in the
Kuropean trade, ‘They were extremely full, deep, and narrow, with a
great deal of “tumble home” to their top sides. This peculiar shape
was due chiefly to the tonnage laws then in vogue, by which one-half
of the length of the main beam was taken from the uaa of the vessel.

is “Report of ie case ‘of en stei amship Matean.
94 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

It will consequently be seen that a vessel which was of extraordinary
depth and very narrow on deck would have an exceedingly great car-
rying capacity in proportion to her tonnage. It was, therefore, the
custom of some merchants to build their vessels of this type for the
foreign trade in order to escape as much as possible the payment of
onerous tonnage dues in the various ports which they visited. As an
instance of the great carrying capacity of the brigs built from this
model, the story is told that one of them, the Keying, of a little less
than 300 tons burden, landed 700 tons of coal in Jamaica, which she
had brought from Cardiff. A second model of special interest in the
collection received from Mr. Cushing is that of a Baltimore clipper
_ brig of 1845. This model, which was designed for a vessel of about 255
tons, is in an excellent state of preservation, and gives us a very good
idea of the extreme clipper vessels of the period when it was con-
structed. One other model, that of the brig Dove, built in 1817, is also
worthy of mention. This is the earliest form of a square-rigged vessel
of which we have a builder’s model.

(18) A beautiful builder’s model of the ship Oregon, of Bath, Me.,
has been presented to the Museum by Mr. William Rogers, of Bath.
This medel is an excellent representative of the type of “half clipper”
ships of the present day, which for the general purpose of trade now
existing have been found the most useful. As the result of many
years’ experience, the ship-builders of to-day have succeeded in com-
bining in a very high degree excellent sailing qualities with great
capacity. Therefore a vessel is obtained which may make rapid pas-
sages and carry a cargo sufficiently large to pay her owners a good
freight. This ship may be taken as a fair illustration of the highest
type of the cotton carriers of the present day, in which trade, we are
informed, she has been employed to a greater or less extent.

(19) Mr. William P. Pattee has presented to the Museum four rather
interesting models of old style merchant vessels, and, together with
Mr. F. W. Weeks, has given us a fine builder’s model of the ship Glas-
gow, built at Bath, Me., in 1836, and employed in the cotton trade
between New Orleans and Liverpoo)]. This model is mounted on a
board, with head, keel, rudder, &c., attached, and is painted in the
same manner as the ship which was built from it. It is especially val-
uable as representing the finest type of cotton carrier of the period
between 1830 and 1840.

(20) Five models of modern merchant vessels, four of which are three-
masted schooners, have been given to the Museum by C. P. Carter &
Co., Belfast, Me. This collection is chiefly interesting from showing
different forms of three-masted schooners employed in various trades.
Two of these, the Meyer and Muller, and the Nellie 8. Picking, represent
the wide, light-draught type of vessel employed in the coasting trade
of the South Atlantic and Gulf ports, where the harbors are generally
SECTION OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE. 95

shallow, while other models illustrate the characteristics of the deeper
sea-going schooners engaged in the general ocean traffic.

_ (21) No more interesting addition has been made to this collection
than that of eight photographic negatives of paintings of merchant ves-
sels of the early part of this century, from 1805 to 1845. Through the
courtesy of several public-spirited citizens of Newburyport, Mass., who
are the owners of the paintings, I was permitted to copy them. Ina
succeeding paragraph these will be mentioned in greater detail.

(22) Among the acquisitions of boat and vessel equipments the fol-
lowing seem deserving of special mention: (1) two nickel-plated models
of steam windlasses, which have been presented by the American
Ship Windlass Company, of Providence, R. I. These models repre-
sent the highest results that have been attained in mechanical contriv-
ances for weighing ships’ anchors, warping, &c.; (2) a coil (100 fathoms)
of 84-inch manila cable, such as is used by the New England fishing
vessels for riding at anchor upon the outer banks. It is an interesting
fact that manila has of late years entirely superseded hemp for this
purpose, having been found more pliable, and in many respects prefer-
able to hemp for cables; (3) a full gang of standing rigging for a fish-
ing schooner, one-half full size, fitted in all its details, has been given
to the Museum by Mr. James M. Simms, of Gloucester, Mass. Proba-
bly no fishing vessels in the world have so much care expended on the
fitting of the rigging as do those of New England, and in this respect
they will bear favorable comparison with yachts; (4) Nathan Richard-
son, of Gloucester, Mass., has given a full-sized sample of ‘“ Richard-
son’s Challenge Steerer.” This steerer, which is one of the many forms
of patent steering wheels now in use on American fishing vessels, is
one of the latest devices, and is an interesting representative type of
the wheels used on the schooners of the Atlantic coast; (5) a full-sized
sample of ‘Collins’ Patent Fog Alarm” has been added to the collec-
tion. This fog alarm was originally devised for use on fishing vessels,
and is believed to be more powerful than any mechanical contrivance
worked by hand now in general use. It derives its chief importance
from the fact that there is probably nothing more needed by American
fishermen than a powerful and efficient fog-horn. Obliged to lie at
anchor on the fishing banks in the direct track of commerce, especially
swift steamers, and where dense fogs prevail nearly all the time in
spring and summer, they are in constant danger of being run down
and sunk—a danger that can only be averted by having a powerful
horn that may be operated by hand. The trawl-line fisheries, too, in-
volve the fishermen in much personal risk that can be obviated only by
the use of a horn of more than ordinary power. During the prevalence
of the thickest fogs the fishermen must put off from their vessels to
set and haul their trawl-lines, generally going distances varying from
one and one-half to three miles. The style of horns commonly in use
cannot, of course, be heard more than a small portion of that distance
96 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

except when there is little or no wind. Therefore, in localities where
the currents are uncertain as to their course and variable in strength,
where the winds are liable to change suddenly, and where fogs are so
dense and so long continued, it is not surprising that many fishermen
go astray in their boats and are exposed to untold suffering, perhaps
death, owing to the fact that they are unable to hear the fog-signals
made on board of the schooner they have left, and which they vainly
strive to find. The local papers in the fishing towns frequently record
the loss of men in this manner, and the escape of others from death,
simply by a hair’s breadth, after enduring the most unheard-of suffering
from exposure, hunger, and thirst. Various devices have been resorted
to to remedy this evil, such as, for instance, carrying cannon to fire in
foggy weather; but heretofore these means have failed to prevent the
frequent recurrence of disaster. The chief objection to cannon is, that
their discharge involves a certain amount of danger as well as expense;
therefore, they are not usually fired until it is deemed absolutely neces-
sary—that is, often not unless it is thought a dory has gone astray, and
then it is frequently ineffective, because the lost men have got too far
from the vessel to hear the sound. The sound of the cannon, moreover,
is so short that its direction, even if the report is heard, is very diffi-
cult to determine. What, therefore, is needed is an implement that
can give out aynearly continuous heavy blast, or a succession of short,
heavy blasts, powerful enough to be heard at a considerable distance,
and repeated at such intervals that no difficulty may be experienced in
determining its location; (6) a very large collection of boat and vessel
fittings, sail-maker’s tools and apparatus, has been given to the Mu-
seum by Messrs. Wilcox, Crittenden & Co., Middletown, Conn. This,
combined with donations previously received from the same house,
makes up an extremely interesting and comprehensive collection of
boat fittings, sail-maker’s gear, material for building boats, &c., proba-
bly the most complete and valuable collection of its kird that is pos-
sessed by any museum in the world.

WORK IN ARRANGING AND CLASSIFYING THE COLLECTION.

There has not been, as yet, any proper arrangement or systematic
classification of the material in this department. The large case and
screen, which were essential for the proper display of the models, were
not completed until the spring of 1883 was well advanced, and, in con-
sequence of my time being employed very much with other matters, all
that it has been possible to do was to make a tentative installment of
the various objects in the collection which it was the most imperative
should be placed where they might be protected from injury. It has,
however, been found necessary to put into temporary storage nearly all
of the collection of vessel and boat fittings. |

A large portion of the full-size specimens and models of vessels
and boats in the collection was either exhibited by the Museum at the
SECTION OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE. 97

International Fisheries Exhibition at London, 1883, or obtained at
that exhibition, as has already been mentioned, by exchange. Much
of this material, being of a very fragile nature—particularly the rigged
models—notwithstanding the great care that was exercised in packing
it, was, when unpacked in the spring, found to be more or less out of
repair. Lacking competent assistance, I was compelled to make the
repairs with my own hands, in almost every instance, and it was only
by a special effort—working late at nights for upwards of three weeks—
that it was possible to make even a preliminary installment of the vari-
ous objects now exhibited. To get the material into the cases, and else-
elsewhere, so that it might be protected from injury, demanded, of
course, my first attention, while the matter of classification, cataloguing,
and the preparation of descriptive labels, could be attended to at a
later date, whenever an opportunity might be afforded.

I will state here that nearly all of the material sent to London was
properly catalogued and descriptive labels of most of the objects were
prepared and printed. After the installation of these models in the
Museum, allusion to which has already been made, I attempted to com-
plete the entering of the various objects in my department, and also made
an effort to prepare a full set of descriptive labels. Could [have had any
assistance in this work, very commendable progress might have been
made, and many highly valuable objects would have been so fully re-
corded and described as to preserve their identification, which alone can
render them of any worth or importance to the Museum. But being al-
most wholly without assistance of any kind; obliged to continue making
repairs on the models even after the first installation, and having many
other matters on hand which engrossed the greater part of my time, I
succeeded in doing only a very small part of the work of cataloguing
and writing labels before I was called away to attend to duties that, at
the time, imperatively demanded my attention; one of which was the
collection of material to represent the development of naval architecture
in the American merchant marine. <A part of this collection has been
sent to the World’s Exposition at New Orleans, but will ultimately be
installed in the National Museum.

RESEARCHES PROSECUTED UPON MATERIAL BELONGING TO THE DE-
PARTMENT.

For the reasons mentioned in the preceding paragraph, it has been
impossible to prosecute any research of importance on the material
in this department. In the introduction of Section I, ‘‘ Catalogue
of the Collection Illustrating the Fishing Vessels and Boats,” &c., ex-
hibited. by the United States at the International Fisheries Exhibition,
London, 1883, Ihave discussed in a general way the history and de-
velopment of the American fishing vessels, and have spoken at length
of the introduction and use of steamers in certain fisheries of this coun-
try. Brief mention has been made of certain types of fishing boats
and the general collection of apparatus accessory to rigging fishing

vessels, &c. This catalogue contains, in addition to the notes already
alluded to, concise descriptions of much of the material in this depart-
ment which more particularly relates to the fisheries of the United
States.

Under the title of “‘ American commerce” the Newburyport Herald,
of November 7, 1884, published an article upon the collection of models,
&ec., in the Museum, and made special mention of builders’ models, pict-
ures, &¢., which had been obtained at Newburyport, Mass

PRESENT STATE OF COLLECTION.

The collection in this department probably contains the largest
amount of material illustrative of the fishing craft of this and other
countries, and the various accessories for rigging such vessels, to be
found in any museum in the world. In this direction, as well as in that
of the more primitive types of water craft in use in various parts of
the globe, the National Museum may fairly claim to be in an excellent
condition. There is not, however, so great an amount of material repre-
senting the merchant marine and naval vessels, of even our own coun-
try, aS might be desired.

So far as the models of boats and ships are concerned, nearly all of
them have been placed on exhibition, but with the materials for the
equipment of vessels, &c., the case is far different, as has already been
indicated. With few exceptions, owing to lack of time and other causes,
it has been found necessary to put these, temporarily, in storage. As
soon, however, as it is practicable, this collection will be properly clas-
sified, arranged, and displayed in the Museum.

STATISTICS.

Owing to causes which have already been alluded to, I find it impos-
sible to give anything more than an approximation of the statistics of
this department, with the exception of the material now exhibited.
There are now on exhibition (including a whale-boat at the New Orleans
Exposition) 28 full-sized boats, canoes, corracles, &c.; 54 builders’ mod-
els, which, with 32 now at New Orleans, make up a total of 86; 305
other models of vessels, boats, canoes, &c., are displayed in the Mu-
seum, and 8 models of this description are now at New Orleans, making
313 in all; 4 water-color sketches of ships of the fifteenth, sixteenth,
and seventeenth centuries; 5 oil paintings of modern types of fishing
vessels; 1 photograph of an English North Sea beam trawler; sketch
of a full-rigged brig; 2 prints of naval vessels; 19 sketches and photo-
graphs of fishing vessels, &c.; and 88 specimens of vessel fittings and
apparatus.

There are held in storage, or what might be, perhaps, called the re-
serve series, about 25 models and some 350 specimens of boat and vessel
fittings.

As to the future development of this department there is much to
be hoped for. Witb the space now at command it would not perhaps
SECTION OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE 99

be possible, even if it were desirable, to display so comprehensive a
collection of rigged models of merchant craft and men-of-war as we
now have of the fishing vessels of this and other countries, but it is
seemingly in the highest degree desirable that there should be procured,
when the opportunity is afforded, a number of models representing the
more important types, at least of merchant vessels. One thing should
be done, or I might say should be the aim of this department, and that
is to get together material which, added to the collection already gath-
ered, may fully and fairly represent the development of naval archi-
tecture in this country, from the discovery of America up to the pres-
ent time. The fishing and commercial marine, as well as the Navy,
have played a most important part in the history of the United States.
It seems eminently fitting, therefore, that in a National Museum, estab-
lished in the capital of the country, a collection should be gathered
which may form a comprehensive illustration of the progress of ideas
and enterprise in the various branches of maritime affairs in which
our people have engaged. While it may not be practicable or even
desirable to do this by gathering together a large collection of rigged
models, it is undoubtedly a fact that the plan I have so briefly alluded
to might be carried out to a great extent by the use of pictures dis-
played on flat screens, and from a study of which one could obtain a
very fair idea of the many types of craft, as well almost as from seeing
the models, and there would be this additional advantage, that exhibits
of this kind could be so displayed as to occupy the smallest possible
space. It is my opinion that there can be very much done by the use
of builders’ models to show the development of naval architecture.
These can be mounted at small expense and painted in the style of the
vessel they represent, while by attaching a small illustration of the ship
to the descriptive label, showing the rig and general appearance of the
vessel under sail or steam, one could gain not only an idea of the shape
of the vessel, her lines, &c., but would have impressed upon his mind
her general appearance under sail. A great deal, perhaps, may be done,
with the aid of the Navy Department, by getting together and properly
mounting some of the many builders’ models of war ships, which are now
little better than old lumber in the cock-lofts of the navy-yard buildings.
It is therefore desirable, whenever it can be done, that pictures of vari-
ous rigs and styles of water craft should be obtained to add to those
which we now have. The importance of getting together such a collec-
tion has already been referred to, so far as it relates to its being a record
of the past history of commerce in this country.

By bringing together a mass of material of this character we are able
to compare one type with another, and it may serve as an important
school for the historian as well as for the naval architect. The latter
may derive useful and valuable knowledge and suggestions from a
study of foreign vessels, and by an intelligent combination of the best
qualities of the craft of other countries with those of our own he
100 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

may be able to devise the very highest types that it is possible to con-
struct. Already something of this kind has been accomplished, the
result being a modification of the form of the fishing vessels. Within
the present year fishing schooners have been built in New England
much deeper than any that have previously been in common use, and
judging from the results already attained, they will be much safer, and
otherwise more serviceable, than the ordinary type we have been accus-
tomed to during the past.

While the foregoing shows what is desirable, so far as adding to the
collection is concerned, I cannot refrain from stating in this place the fact
that it seems of the utmost importance that the material we now have
should receive more attention than it has been possible for me to give it.
Since my time is so largely occupied with other duties, in connection with
the Fish Commission, &e., [ hope it will not be out of place if I humbly
suggest the importance of my having more assistance when at Wash-
ington to aid me in arranging and classifying the material in this de-
partment, as well as in doing other necessary work. Unfortunately, as
the case now stands, in spite of the utmost efforts I have been able to
put forth, a considerable portion of the material of this department
has not been entered on the catalogue, neither have there been prepared
proper descriptive labels for many of the objects. The identification of
many Of the models depends solely upon my memory and the knowledge
of the various craft, &c., which I have obtained by study and experi-
ence. It has been my wish to place the collection in such shape that it
would be perfectly practicable for some one else to take control of it and
go on with the work without any trouble or hindrance. This seems emi-
nently desirable, since, as all men are mortal, the value of any portion
of such a collection ought not to depend so much on any single indi-
vidual.

It seems proper in this place that mention should be made of the im-
portance of having descriptive and historical labels for each object. In
no other way, in my opinion, can a collection be rendered so instructive
and valuable as it can be by having attached to each article a somewhat
comprehensive label. ‘This having been done, a visitor to the Museum,
even a child, may acquire all the more important facts respecting
anything he may be specially interested in, while to the student these
labels will prove invaluable. Generally a label should not only give an
idea of the form of the object described and its dimensions, but it should
also contain what it is used for, and the locality from which it comes,
etec.; in a word, all the knowledge that one ordinarily cares to obtain.
More fully to illustrate the point which we are trying to make, we insert
the following samples of labels prepared for objects in this collection:

FISHING SCHOONER GERTIE EVELYN, OF GLOUCESTER, MASS.

Sectional model, port side, scale 1 inch to 1 foot. This model shows the exterior and
interior of the port side of a clipper fishing schooner, such as are now employed 1n the
general deep-sea fisheries of New England. It is specially designed to show the ar-
SECTION OF NAVAL ARCHITECTURE. 101

rangement of the interior, such as the forecastle, cook’s pantry and store-room, ice-
houses for the refrigeration of fish, bait, &c., the stowage of ballast, cabin, gear-room,
&c. The ice-house is built in the style which has been most commonly adopted on
vessels employed in the fresh-halibut fishery or the winter haddock fishery, and with
the exception that on some of the vessels the ice-house is divided into two sections—
the “forward” and “after” ice-houses—by a bulkhead just abaft the mainmast, few,
if any, differ from this. Comparatively few American schooners carry any other than
stone ballast, and such is shown, though a few, especially those of smaller size, have
some—that which is stowed each side of the keelson—iron ballast, and in excep-
tional cases a vessel may be wholly ballasted with iron. The forecastle, which is the
sleeping apartment for a portion of the crew and for the cook, and the place where
the cooking is done, and where the entire crew, including the captain, eat their meals,
is finished in pine, painted and grained. Lockers run around both sides, and serve
the double purpose of seats for the men and stowage for vegetadles, &c. The cooking-
stove sits on a platform, raised about 4 to 6 inches above the floor, at the after end of
the forecastle on the starboard side. There are three lengths of sleeping berths (five
berths only of which are nsually occupied) on the port side, and two lengths on the
starboard side, though it rarely happens that they are all filled. Besides these there
are two more berths on the starboard side, aft of the ‘‘dish-closet” (which is at the
side about abreast of the foremast), that are used by the cook for the storage of small
stores and other material which he uses. At the after end of the forecastle, on the
port side, is a small upright closet with shelves where the cook keeps a supply of eat-
ables, which the fishermen have access to at all hours of the day and night; this is
called the ‘‘grub-locker.” Near this is the door leading into the forehold, where are
the cook’s pantry on the port side, and the coal-pen on the starboard side, and where
also is stowed a supply of wood, flour, beef, pork, &c. Beneath the floor of the pantry,
at least in part, are the water-casks, each holding about 250 to 400 gallons, these being
supplemented by a greater or less number of barrels filled with water, which are also
stowed in the forehold. In the pantry the cook prepares the food for cooking, and
this apartment is often painted in a neat and tasty manner. The ice-house is sep-
arated from the pantry by a double bulkhead of matched boards with tarred paper
between. The platform of the ice-house is usually made of spruce or pine planks 2
inches in thickness, these being laid on sleepers of 3 by 4 scantling, which are fitted
in their proper places, well secured, and also supported in the middle before the ballast
is put on board. The platform is held securely in place by the stanchions which form
the framework of the pens or sections into which the ice-house is divided. Each pen
is separated from the next by a single partition of one-inch boards. A portion of the
front of each side pen is tightly closed up from the floor to the deck, while the re-
mainder is adjustable, a number of ‘‘ pen-boards” being cut of suitable lengths so that
by sliding in grooves in the upright stanchions they may be put in or removed as oc-
easion demands. The pens on the sides are called ‘‘ wing-pens,” while those in the
center aisle are known as ‘‘slaughter-house pens,” the one, however, which is directly
under either the main or after hatch having the name of ‘‘slaughter-house.” The
cabin is finished with hard wood, usually black walnut and ash; it has four berths,
the forward one of which on the starboard side is occupied by the captain, while the
others are taken by such members of the crew as may secure them by lot, since there
are no under officers to claim them by right. Beneath the cabin floor, in which there
is a small trap-door, a supply of coal for the cabin stove is carried. Aft of the cabin,
in the extreme stern, is a rough, unfinished apartment, where such materials as spare
fishing-gear, light sails, cordage, blocks, &c., are stowed. The larger mass of fishing-
gear, which is very bulky, is stowed in the ice-house when the vessel is making pas-
sages. The particular schooner which this model represents was built by Messrs.
Bishop & Murphy, of Gloucester, Mass., and launched in February, 1883. She has been
employed in the winter haddock fishery, carrying her catch fresh to market, a distance
varying from 150 to 300 miles. She is about 82 tons register (135 tons builder’s meas-
102 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

ure), and has made a good record for speed and sea-worthiness. She is from 4 to 6
inches deeper than the average American fishing schooner of the same size, has fine
lines, with long, sharp bow, which is slightly concave beneath the water line; mod-
erately full bilge; broad beam; long, finely-ent run; rather full, elliptical stern,
which has considerable overhang. The relative dimensions of spars, sails, and rig-
ging for this class of vessel is shown on the full rigged models. Gloucester, Mass.,

Gloucester, Mass., 1883. 57,051. Designed by Capt. J. W. Collins, U. 8. Fish
Commission.

This model represents a schooner of about 90 to 100 tons register, designed espe-
cially for the winter fisheries. A vessel built from it would be about 2 feet deeper than
the typical American fishing schooner of the same length, and about 1 foot less beam.
[t would have less difference in draught between the bow and stern, or less ‘“‘ drag-
line.” The rig differs from that of the ordinary schooner in having a stem staysail
and jib, instead of the large jib now commonly used, and also in having shorter
lower masts. In summer the rig might be changed by the addition of a foretop-
mast and jib-boom, with sails to correspond. It is believed that a vessel con-
structed on such a model would be safer in heavy gales, and much swifter, taking the
chances as they come, than schooners of the ordinary type, which have much less
body under water. The ballast can, of course, be placed lower, and thereby the lev-
erage increased and the chances of capsizing decreased.

Essex, Mass. Type, 1845 to 1860. U.S. Fish Commission. 54,405.

This is the model of the schooner Elisha Holmes, of Cape Cod, built at Essex in
1849, to engage in the cod and mackerel fisheries. It is the form of a class of vessels
very much in use in the period from 1845 to 1860, and represents one type of the so-
called sharp-shooters of that day. During the transition stage from full-bowed to
sharp vessels it was the opinion of many experts that it would be unsafe to build a
vessel very sharp on the rail. It was thought that with a full rounding bow on top
and much flare, a vessel would be prevented from plunging as deep in the water as
she otherwise might do. Later developments have shown that this theory is a wrong
one, and that a vessel with a flaring bow is not as good as one with straighter top
timbers.

Vessels of the class represented by this model fish for cod chiefly on the Storregen
Bank. They make one voyage yearly, starting in April and returning in September.
They hail from the island of Tjorn, on the Bohuslan coast. ‘The peculiar flaring bow
is thought to be necessary, by Swedish fishermen, to enable the vessel to ride safely

Island of Gottland, Sweden, 1876. 28,149.
[Gift of Swedish Centennial Commission.]

Boats of this class are used in the herring fisheries from the island of Gottland in
the Baltic Sea, off the east coast of Sweden. In 1869, the number of boats so employed
from that island was officially given at 606, manned by 1,911 persons. The Gottland
boats have an excellent reputation for seaworthiness. It is said they are often caught
out in heavy gales. The largest of these craft are 25 feet long.

NETHERLANDS LIFE-BOAT.

[Model.]

Oak, with cork bead or half-round band along sides; open iron railing; unpainted.
Model divided into two sections, from stem to stern, to show the interior arrangement.
This boat has a round bilge; low, flat floor; a wide, very shallow keel; both ends
alike, full and round; curved stem and stern-post, both of which are high. Running
around both sides, from stem to stern-post, is an open iron railing, four standards of
which have row-locks at their upper ends. These rails are about 3 feet high on a
full-sized boat, and are for the purpose of preventing the occupants of the boat from
being washed overboard. Boat has two decks, between which are snugly packed a
large nuinber of air-tight galvanized iron boxes that fill the space between decks.
Along the sides of the boat are a number of holes provided with valves through which
water enters to fill the section below the lower deck. The boat, when afloat, is sup-
ported entirely by the air-tight boxes. Two strong cleats across the upper deck hold

This form of life-boat was designed by Mr. Maas, who says it has been used with
great success in saving shipw recked crews in the shallow waters off the Netherlands
coast. It is claimed that the boat is not capsizable, though this may be questioned,

Among the desiderata, which it occurs to me as the most needed at
the present time, I would mention the following rigged models: (1) A
snow of the seventeenth century; (2) the Mayflower; (3) a topsail sloop
(a craft much used in fishing and whaling in the early history of the
country); (4) Fulton’s steamer, the Clermont; (5) old style topsail and
top-gallant sail schooner; (6) Hermaphrodite brig; (7) brigantine; (8)
square-rigged brig; (9) bark; (10) ship, medium clipper; (11) a Con-
necticut sloop smack; (12) two-masted coasting schooner, Atlantic
coast; (13) three-masted schooner of the Atlantic coast; (14) four-
masted schooner of the lakes; (15) a Rockport, Mass., stone sloop;
(16) American pilot boat; (17) sloop yacht; (18) schooner yacht; (19)
cutter yacht; (20) Louisiana fishing lugger; (21) Cedar Key net-boat;
(22) New Jersey surf-boat; (23) transatlantic steamship; (24) Missis-
sippi River steamer; (25) Hudson River steamer; (26) stern-wheel
steamer, style used on Western rivers; (27) auxiliary steam whaler;
(28) steam yacht; (29) the model of the Viking ship exhumed in Nor-
way: (30) an English North Sea beam-trawler; (51) a Brixham fishing

ger; (34) an English well-smack; (35) a French fishing lugger of Bou-
logne; (36) a British steam-trawler.

The historical models might be supplemented by pictures of (1)
polacca-rigged vessel; (2) barkentine; (3) steamer Savannah, which
was the first to cross the Atlantic; and (4) a series of illustrations of
the earliest attempts to construct steamboats.

HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION.

Previous to the establishment of the National Museum by an act of
Congress in 1846, the earliest accessions which now constitute this col-
lection had been gathered by the Wilkes Exploring Expedition, 183842.
These consisted chiefly of a few models of the canoes and other water
craft used by the natives of the Pacific islands.* From 1842 to 1876 a
few models of canoes, &c., were obtained from various sources, but none
of them were of especial importance as compared with the more exten-
sive accessions in recent years, and it may be safely asserted that betore
the Centennial Exhibition the amount of material gathered appertain-
ing to this department was relatively smallin amount. The fine collec-
tions that were brought together at Philadelphia on the occasion of the
Centennial Exhibition in 1876 were almost without exception presented
to the Museum. By these generous gifts of foreign Governments and
individuals the Museum became the possessor of a rich collection both
of domestic and foreign water craft. Among other things derived from

*It is to be regretted that most, in fact nearly all, of these models, owing to lack
of care and perhaps to the fact that they were moved about considerably before
becoming the property of the National Museum, are very much out of repair, and in
some instances have been injured to such an extent as to practically render them
worthless.
106 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

this source and which are deserving of special mention, is that of a
large dugout war canoe, 59 feet in length, from British Columbia, which
now forms a prominent feature of this department. Large collections
of boats were also obtained from Norway, Sweden, China, and Siam,
which are of great value and especially interesting to the student of
naval architecture.

On the occasion of the participation of the U. 8. Fish Commission
in the International Fisheries Exhibition held at Berlin in 1880, the
collection was much enlarged by the addition of numerous forms of
American fishing craft, sporting and hunting boats, &; while by ex-
change and purchase at the close of the exhibition several very desir-
able acquisitions were obtained, principally of German and Dutch fish-
ing craft. The act of Congress authorizing the participation of the
U. S. Fish Commission in the International Fisheries Exhibition at
London, in 1888, enabled us to make other additions to our collection
representing the fishing flotilla of the United States, which, as has
elsewhere been stated, now comprises representatives of nearly all the
more important types of water craft engaged in this special industry.
In the mean time Mr. James G. Swan, assistant U. 8. Fish Commis-
sion, who has been stationed at Port Townsend, Washington Territory,
has been indefatigable in getting together a vast deal of interesting
and valuable material which represents the different forms of canoes,
dugouts, and other boats used by the Indians of the northwest coast.

We have already stated that the collection has been much enriched
by donations from foreign nations and individuals who participated in
the London Fisheries Exhibition, as well as by citizens of our own
country.
I (F).—REPORT UPON THE SECTION OF FOODS OF THE U. 8,
NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

By Romyn HitTcucock, Acting Curator.

The collection of foods, drinks, narcotics, ete., which has been placed
temporarily under my charge, has received during the year some valu-
able additions, but it has been impossible to devote much time to ar-
ranging or labeling the specimens; the labor required to prepare the
collection of textiles for the New Orleans Exposition having greatly in-
terfered with the regular work in this department. Such specimens
as have been received, however, have been properly cared for, and in
most instances placed in the cases with temporary labels attached.

IMPORTANT ADDITIONS.

Thirty-three specimens of foods, spices, and fruits of various countries
from the Royal Botanical Gardens, Kew, England.

Thirteen specimens, including starches, jellies, grains, and fruits,
from the Goverment of Hawaii, received through the Boston Foreign
Exposition.

A series of seventeen specimens of Cheshire salt, from Cheshire, Eng-
land, presented by Mr. J. J. Higgin, of Liverpool, England.

Seventy-six specimens of food from Guatemala, including coffees in
great variety, cacao beans, starches, flours, annato, tamarinds, and vari-
ous other articles, received through the Boston Foreign Exposition.

Nine specimens of foods from Brazil, including coffees, maté, sugar,
banana paste, araca paste, etc., received through the Boston Foreign
Exposition.

Fifty-two specimens from San Salvador, including seven specimens
of cigars, ten of leaf tobacco, ten of coffee, with varieties of honey, corn,
rice, beans, and various other products, received through the Boston
Foreign Exposition.

Seventy-nine specimens of canned goods, pickles, sauces, and manu-
factured articles of various kinds, from Messrs. Crosse & Blackwell,
London.

Thirty-one specimens of foods of various kinds, collected for the Mu-
seum by Mr. V. P. Parkhurst, in Jamaica.

108 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1384. :

Thirteen specimens of the “ dalls” of various qualities used in India,
from Rev. C. H. A. Dall.

ROUTINE WORK.

The collection of foods of the North American Indians, which is large
and of great interest, has been arranged in order, but many duplicate
specimens are in the cases, which must be removed when there is op-
portunity for studying the collection. These foods being principally
vegetable products, which are for the most part used without prepara-
tion other than roasting or boiling, it has seemed advisable to arrange
them according to their botanical relations.

The other specimens of food are partly arranged in the cases accord-
ing to the system proposed by the Assistant Director, and published in
Volume LY of the “ Proceedings,” appendix.

PRESENT STATE OF COLLECTION.

There are now on exhibition—

RECOMMENDATIONS AND REMARKS.

The collection of foods can be made of far greater interest than one
who has given no consideration to the subject would suppose. It is
not intended to be merely one set of specimens in bottles to show what
people eat, but it should be made to indicate the dietetic value of foods
of various kinds, to represent the best knowledge concerning the nutri-
tive value and digestibility of various foods, resulting from physiolog-
ical and chemical investigations. Not only should it indicate the value
of a.food, but it should also explain to what peculiar qualities or con-
stituents its value is due, and what combinations of foods are necessary
to the maintenance of health and strength. At present the collection
possesses very little scientific value; but it is hoped that in the course
of another year there may be a great change in this respect. Already
Prof. W. O. Atwater, whose analyses of various articles of food are well
known to chemists, has contributed some valuable results of his labors,
in the form of specimens for exhibition, to illustrate the composition of
the human body. These will soon he displayed, and thus a beginning
made toward making a collection which shall be of great educational
interest and value. The progress that can be made in this work must,
however, depend very much upon the assistance which the acting cura-
tor receives to carry on the regular museum work.
II.—REPORT OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY OF THE U.
S. NATIONAL MUSEUM FOR 1884.

By Otis T. Mason, Curator.

The duties of curator of the Department of Ethnology in the National
Museum were assumed on the first day of July, 1884. My first work
was to gather from the various rooms of the Smithsonian Institution,
from the Armory, and from the National Museum, every specimen of
anthropological material not already cared for by the curator of An-
tiquities, the curator of Civilized Arts and Industries, and the honor-
ary curator of Keramics. These objects I have arranged in drawers
according to certain classific concepts, not necessarily the same as those
used in the Museum, the intention being to facilitate ready reference
and comparative study. The advantage of this method is readily seen
in the fact that every ethnologic specimen can be found at once by my
assistants, that those things which are suggestive of the progress of
each art lie side by side, and that specimens badly defined or without
labels have easy explanation by means of their nearest neighbors. One
fact is revealed by this plan of temporary storage. It is that the former
methods of collecting material should now be replaced by a still more
exhaustive and scientific method. Every specimen now in the collection
is valuableand will find a place infuture installation; many also have the
great merit of being old and well authenticated; but, owing to the youth of
ethnologic science, hardly any efforts have been made to exhaust a single
art to represent its life-history in its entirety. The comparative anatomist
hopes by means of well-dissected specimens of present animal life to
reconstruct from a bone or two some extinct form. What would be the
chances of success for him, however, if he had but a few fragments of
the modern animal? Is not the attempt to reconstruct the society of
primeval man by means of desultory collections from the modern sav-
ages quite as futile? Now, with the permission of the Director and As-
sistant Director of the Museum, I should like to introduce a still more
rigorous policy in this regard, recommending, first, that all collectors
shall be instructed to observe faithfully all of the elements of each art,
and to omit nothing, however cheap or trivial, that illuminates it; sec-
ondly, that the friends of the Museum who have gratuitously contrib-
uted to its success, and who will continue to do so, be advised of our

109
110 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

wishes in this matter. Doubtless material of questionable reference
will continue to flow in, but under the secure guidauce of things wisely
selected even rubbish, well authenticated, will become useful. In ear-
rying out this view I would recommend the preparation of a short and
explicit guide-book on this subject. I would also most earnestly request
that contributors to our collections be impressed with the necessity of
sending their specimens which are subject to destruction by moths,
breakage, or weather promptly to the Museum, and to give as much
attention to preservation as to collection. It is a lamentable fact that
a very large number of the objects received during my short term have
been rendered comparatively worthless by a neglect of this precaution.
I cannot think of a greater disaster in museum work than that in which
the gatherings of a lifetime frequently are sacrificed in a few short weeks.
If contributors cannot comply with this request at once, they should
soak the specimens in benzine to kill any vermin already concealed, and
with a fine brush go over the parts in danger with a solution of arsenic
and alcohol, or corrosive sublimate in alcohol, drying in the shade.

Among the ends which the curator of the Department of Ethnology is
very anxious to accomplish, and toward which he begs the co-operation of
his scientific brethren, no one seems to be more important than a correct
nomenclature of the different classes of objects with which he has to
deal. On the one hand an utter disregard of nomenclature is so vicious
that no argument need be urged against it. Onthe other hand there is
a danger of overloading the subject with too many difficult names, tend-
ing rather to confusion than to perspicuity. The following rules, found
to be of the greatest service to anthropo-biologists, will certainly meet
with favor from all comparative technologists:

First. Every class or species of objects, and every distinct part of each
object, should have a name. ;

Second. Each class or part should have but one distinctive name,
although synonyms well understood may be allowed.

Third. Distinctive names should apply to only one class of objects or
parts.

Fourth. Names in good use, if distinctive, should always have prefer-
ence.

Fifth. If a class of objects is confined to a definite locality, then the
name used for that class in that region should be adopted, e. g., kyak,
babbiche, tepee, &c. If necessary, Latin and Greek compounds may
be used when no other modern appellation can be found.

ACCESSIONS OF THE YEAR.

It is contemplated to prepare, with copious illustrations, a classified
report of all the ethnological materials in the Museum, according to
those concepts or categories that are in use among ethnologists, such as
function, tribe, geographical distribution, degree of elaboration, mate-
rial, classes of investigators, &c. For the present, in order to show in
REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF ETHNOLOGY. sh

as profitable manner as possible the true value of the year’s collection,
and also to bring before the mind of the Director the great gaps that
have been left, a beginning is here made of the kind of report hinted at
above.

The geographical concept is here made prominent, because it brings
us into immediate relations with the collectors. Following this, classes
of objects, with their functions, receive attention, especial care being
taken to distinguish the relation of form, &c., to tribe, environment, and
material.

ESKIMO OF GREENLAND.

Disco Island.—Plate of whale’s vertebra and bone implement found on
Disco Island by the Greely Relief Expedition. 5 pieces.

Holsteinberg.—A kyak with accouterments complete, consisting of
the typical Greenland skin kyak, line-rack, harpoon, harpoon-line, and
throwing stick (the latter having two perforations to fit in ivory hooks
in the shafts of the harpoon), seal-skin float, double paddle strengthened
with plates of ivory, short lance, halibut lance, fair-weather jacket—
which is simply a broad cincture of dressed seal-skin fastened around
the hole at the top of the kyak and under the arm-pits of the navi-
gator, to keep the spray from entering the boat, and water-proof jacket
of seal-skin worn during rough weather.

ESKIMO OF POINT BARROW.

One of the most valuable collections in the National Museum is that
which was deposited during the last year by Lieut. P. H. Ray. Inas-
much as an exhaustive report of this collection is now being prepared
by Mr. John Murdock, only a brief mention of the various classes of
objects will be made here.

Mr. Murdock distinguishes three types of the lance—the slender deer lance, the
medium bear lance, and the broad, clumsy whale lance—none of them barbed.

In some of the entries given above, the numbers include several spec-
imens. Omitting pottery, antiquities, examples of textiles, fishing, and
navigation, the number of purely ethnological specimens received dur-
ing the year will amount to not far from four thousand.
II (4).—REPORT UPON THE SECTION OF AMERICAN ABORIGI-
NAL POTTERY OF THE U.S. NATIONAL MUSEUM FOR 1884.

By WiLi1aM H. Houmes, Honorary Curator.

The greater part of the collection of aboriginal American pottery
has been placed in the northwest court of the Museum. A preliminary
classification has been made, and as soon as the necessary cases are
completed a representative series will be placed on exhibition.

The wall cases have been finished and are now occupied, chiefly,
by the very extensive collection of modern pueblo ware. The arrange-
ment is only temporary, however, as the final placing will not be at-
tempted until the more recent additions are catalogued. During the
year a large case has been constructed for the center of the hall, and
plans have been made for a number of smaller cases for the floor.

The year is remarkable for the great number of additions to the col-
lection, upwards of ten thousand earthen vessels having been acquired
and entered upon the books. These have been obtained through pur-
chase, exchange, and donation, as well as through the various agents
of the Museum.

The Bureau of Ethnology has contributed upwards of six thousand
pieces. These comprise the collections of James Stevenson from the
modern pueblos; of Victor Mindeleff, E. H. Nelson, and H. ©. Yarrow,
from the ancient ruins of New Mexico, Arizona, and Utah, and of Dr.
Cyrus Thomas, from the valley of the Mississippi.

A small collection of interesting fragments from the shell mounds of
Maryland was donated by Mr. J. D. McGuire, and a number of fugitive
pieces have come from various Southern States. An addition to the
Mexican collection, consisting of about one hundred pieces, mostly in
a fragmentary state, has been acquired, by donation, from the writer.

Perhaps the most unique and important acquisition of the year is
that of some three thousand vases from the ancient tombs of Chiriqui,
State of Colombia. This collection was secured from J.C. McNeil, the
collector. An extremely valuable collection from Ancon, Peru, has
been secured through the agency of Dr. Wiliam H. Jones.

In cataloguing and arranging the collection the curator has been as-
sisted by Mr. Henry Waltherand Mr. William H. Barbour. The ordinary

121

entry in the records is generally supplemented by a drawing of the
specimen. As many of the vases reach the Museum in a fragmentary
state, it is found desirable to have them carefully restored. In this
work Mr. Walther is extremely skillful. Care is taken that such res-
torations do not, in any way, falsify the original characters of the ves-
sel.

The curator has been engaged during the year in the study of por-
tions of the collection, first, for the purpose of securing the best pos-
sible classification of the material for Museum purposes, and second,
with the view of publishing a monograph upon the aboriginal pottery of
America. One paper has been prepared on the ‘* Pottery of the An-
cient Pueblos,” and another upon the ‘“ Ancient Ware of the Middle
Missisippi Valley.” They are supplemented by a third paper upon the
‘Origin of form and ornament in the Ceramic Art.” These papers will
appear in the Fourth Annual Report of the Bureau of Ethnology. In
addition, a short study of the ceramic products of a section exposed in
the city of Mexico has been made. This will appear in the proceedings
of the Anthropological Society of Washington. ‘

It will be seen that the collection, already an extremely valuable one,
promises in the near future to be worthy of a national museum, but
there are many gaps that must be filled up before it can be considered
satisfactory to students of American archeology. The collections
from all parts of Mexico and the northern Central American states
need especial attention. In South American material we are still far
behind the museums of Europe.

Statement of character of routine work in arranging and classifying the
collections, and preparing the exhibition and study series.

The arranging, classifying, and preparing for exhibition of the collee-
tions received has been continued in accordance with the plan indicated
in my annual report for 1883. Practically there are but three classes
or series of specimens entered in this department: 1. Exhibition and
study series, which embraces all good specimens. 2. Duplicates, uti)-
ized for exchange. 3. Storage, broken stone specimens, and other frag-
ments of no value whatever.

List of special collections which have been placed on exhibition during
the year.

Collection from Alaska: C. L. McKay.
Collection from shell-heaps, Cape Mendocino, Humboldt County, Cali-
fornia: John J? McLean.
126 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

Collection from Riceville, Washington County, Wisconsin: J. BE.
Gere.

Collection from Dos Pueblos and La Patera, Santa Barbara County,
California: Lieut. G. M. Wheeler.

Collection from Tennessee: W. M. Clark.

Collection from Flint Ridge, Licking County, Ohio: C. M. Smith.

The work of arranging collections for exhibition has been unavoida-
bly delayed for the past few months by reason of the time required for
preparing specimens for the New Orleans Exhibition. The chipped
series of North American stone implements designed for the Exhibi-
tion was finally arranged in sixteen trays, and the same delivered to
Mr. C. A. Stewart for shipment. The ground or polished series will
soon be ready.

Collections and single specimens sent as exchanges during the year.

A cast of a lydite chisel (original from Saint Lawrence County, New
York), sent to M. Felix Gaillard, Plouharnel, Morbihan, France.

A collection of 23 North American stone implements, sent to Mr.
Ernest Schernikow, No. 16 Saint Mark’s Place, New York.

A cast of a stone (jadeite ?) celt and handle in one piece, sent to Dr.
RK. T. Hamy, No. 40 Rue de Lubeck, Paris, France.

A collection of 355 North yoann stone relics, sent to Mr. see
Wilson, United States consul, Nice, France.

& sae collection of seas implements, &c., and the relics obtained
in the course of several mound-explorations made under the direction of
the Bureau of Ethnology have been placed in charge of this department.
For want of time, no systematic arrangement has thus far been made.
The specimens from each mound have been kept together, and the work
of classifying the rest of the collection (surface-tinds, &c.) will be com-
menced immediately. A large number of duplicate specimens can be
used for exchange.

Review of researches prosecuted upon material belonging to the department.

The hall containing the antiquities of the United States National Mu-
seum has been visited by many persons, who manifested their interest in
archeology by questions addressed to myself and to my assistant. Some
of the visitors took notes and made sketches of specimens; but I am un-
able to state in what manner the information acquired by them .was
utilized. Self-instruction may have been the chief motive in most cases.
I had myself constant recourse to the collection in the preparation of
my work on prehistoric fishing in Europe and North America, which
contains designs and descriptions of a large number of specimens on
exhibition in the hall. This work has taken up all my time not devoted
to routine business.

Recommendations and general remarks.

In this year, as in preceding ones, I have endeavored to carry on the
dualistic system adopted in arranging the antiquities of this coun'ry.

(1) There is a large collection (mostly exhibited in flat cases) which
consists of relics of chipped and ground stone, of copper, bone, horn,
shell, clay, and, to a small extent, of wood. These objects huve been
grouped according to material, and then classed under such denomina-
tions as their forms suggested. Similarity of shape afforded the prin-
cipal guidance in arranging these specimens. This arrangement offers
to the intelligent visitor an opportunity to take in atone glance, as it
were, the whole culture of the prehistoric North American, as far as it
can be represented by tangible tokens. To this general collection many
valuable specimens have been added this year.

(2) There are special collections composed of North American articles
found in one locality—a mound, grave, artificial shell-deposit, or district.
It will be my endeavor to increase the number of these special collee-
tions, in order to show the difference in the mechanical acquirements of
the people formerly inhabiting the various parts of this country. Six
of such collections have been put up in the course of this year—as stated
in section 2 of this report—imost conspicuous among them being the
large and fine series of antiquities collected during Lieut. George M.
Wheeler’s geographical survey west of the 100th meridian.

The collections thus far mentioned are from portions of this continent
north of Mexico. There are, however, separately exhibited, valuable
archeological collections from Mexico, Central America, South America,
Japan, &c., and a very good representative series of prehistoric antiqui-
ties from Europe.
IV.—REPORT UPON THE DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS OF THE
U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM FOR 1884.

By FREDERICK W. TRUE, Curator.

IMPORTANT ADDITIONS DURING THE YEAR 13884,

In number, variety, and importance, the accessions of the past year
have been fully equal to those of earlier periods. A few specimens of
species previously unknown to science were received, but the chief gain
has been in species new to the collections, specimens representing new
variations of species acquired in the past years, or serving to extend
our knowledge of their geographical range, and specimens suitable to
replace those which have become faded and otherwise unsightly through
long service in the exhibition halls.

In enlarging the exhibition series, much aid has been received from
the proprietors of zoological gardens and menageries and from dealers
in live animals. The number of species received from these sources
during the year was 38, including several rare and peculiar forms. Not
less assistance has been received from the Signal Bureau, the U. 8.
Life-Saving and Light-House Services, the U.S. Fish Commission, and
other bureaus of the Government, the attachés of which are more or less
engaged in field-work. The negotiations of the American commissioner
to the London Fisheries Exhibition and of the curator of the depart-
ment with the authorities of certain European museums have led to
the revival of the system of exchanges, which has always proved bene-
ficial.

In addition, collections of greater or less magnitude have been re-
ceived from about fifty private individuals and corporations. The
specimens purchased for the New Orleans Exhibition may properly be
mentioned in this connection, as they will eventually be incorporated
in the collections of the department. (For complete list of accessions
see page 138.)

TERRESTRIAL MAMMALS.

United States —Two new species, each representing a new genus, have
been added to the mammalian fauna of the United States during the
year. The first of these, a muskrat-like form, was described by the cu-

S. Mis. 33, pt. 2——9 129
130 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

rator under the name of Neofiber Alleni,* from a single specimen col-
lected by William Wittfeld, Esq., at Georgiana, Fla. The second new
species, a Shrew, was described by Dr. Merriam under the name Ato-
phyrax Bendireit. The type of this species is not in the Museum. An-
other apparent addition to the fauna is the Brazlian bat, known as Ves-
pertilio arsinoé, a specimen of which was sent to the Museum from Ban-
ner, Kans., by Mr. A. B. Baker.

The Museum purchased from the same gentleman a pair of extraor-
dinarily large specimens of Ord’s pocket-mouse, Dipodomys Phillipsit
Ordii, for exhibition at New Orleans. Mr. Lewis Sells presented an
exceedingly fine puma, Felis concolor, which was mounted in the best
manner by the chief taxidermist, and was also sent to the New Orleans
Exhibition. Skins of a red lynx, peccary, mountain sheep, and beaver,
and one or two smaller forms were purchased from Mr. H. A. Ward
for exhibition at the same place, the collection being found wanting in
mountable specimens of these animals.

The most important faunal collections have been those of Mr. C. H.
Townsend, from California, and Mr. E. W. Nelson, from Arizona. The
former collection includes fresh specimens of nearly all the important
terrestrial mammals of California and aquatic species as well. Worthy
of special mention is an extensive series of antlers of the Columbian
deer, Cariacus columbianus, showing numerous curious variations. Mr.
Nelson’s collection consists mostly of rodents and other small forms,
but he has recently been in quest of the large species.

British America and Alaska.—The officers of the Signal Bureau sta-
tioned at Point Barrow sent, in connection with other specimens, a large
series of skins of the lemmings, Cuniculus torquatus and Myodes obensis.
From British America the most important accession is the collection of
skins and skeletons made by Mr. Lucien M. Turner in the vicinity of Hud-
son’s Bay. The series included two very fine skins of the Polar hare,
Lepus timidus, one of which was sent to the New Orleans Exhibition.

Central America and the West Indies.—Mr. Benedict, naturalist of the
U.S. Fish Commission steamship Albatross, while in the West Indies,
secured after much labor a number of specimens of the so-called
fishing bat, Noctilio leporinus, var. mastivus, and of the common arti-
beus, A. perspicillatus. The authorities of the British Museum pre-
sented a series of specimens of West Indian and Central American bats,
representing species previously wanting in our collections.

The department has also received from Mr. Zeledon a number of
Costa Rican mammals, including a specimen of Felis yaguarundi, from
which a skeleton will be prepared.

Other parts of the world.—As already stated, the number of exotic
mammals received during the year has been per large, owing princi-
pally to the great number of donations from dealers in live animals and

proprietors of menageries and zoological gardens. Messrs. Barnum,
Bailey & Hutchinson, Messrs. C. and E. Reiche, Mr. W. A. Conklin
(superintendent of the Central Park Menagerie, New York), aud the
authorities of the Dime Museum, Washington, have together presented
no less than 27 monkeys. The first-named gentlemen have also sent
several other important animals, such as an eland, a harnessed antelope,
a leopard, a peceary, and two hunting-leopards. Mr. Conklin sent, in
addition to the monkeys, a specimen of the curious Jemur, Stenops tardi-
gradus, a second lemur, a kangaroo, an Egyptian jumping-mouse, a
mongoose, a fruit-eating bat, and a young hog-deer. Mr. Lewis Sells,
of Cincinnati, presented, in addition to the puma mentioned on page 130,
a fine wart-hog and a baboon.

Surgeon-Major Dobson, of Netley, England, in consideration for some
American insectivores sent him for dissection, has presented a collec-
tion of Asiatic and European bats and insectivores. In the collection
made by Mr. P. L. Jouy in Japan were found a number of the char-
acteristic mammals of those islands. Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, during
his visit to Eastern Siberia, procured a very fine series of skulls of the
brown bear, U. arctos, and two skins of the Siberian sheep, O. nivicolea.
His collections of aquatic mammals will be mentioned in another place
(see below). While in London the curator purchased a small collection
of exotic mammals, including a skin of Galidia olivacea, and a skull of
the rare lemur, Propithecus holomelas. Other similar specimens were
purchased frow Mr. H. A. Ward, of Rochester, among them a specimen
of Riippell’s monkey (Guereza Riippelli), a civet cat, and a llama.

AQUATIC MAMMALS.

Seals.—A number of important pinnipeds were received during the
year. The last boxes of specimens collected by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger
in Bering Island contained a very large series of skulls of Steller’s
sea-lion, Humetopias Stelleri, the harbor seal, P. vitulina, &c., and, in
addition, a skull of the Pacific walrus.

Mr. C. H. Townsend has sent specimens of the pinnipeds of the Cali-
fornian coast, notably skeletons and skins of the California sea-lion,
Zalophus californianus. Four skeletons of the harp seal were purchased
from a Newfoundland whaler, through Dr. C. H. Merriam; and from
Captain Longstreet, of the life-saving station at Manisquan, N. J., was
received a fresh specimen of Phoca vitulina.

Cetaceans.—The year has been a notable one so far as cetaceans are
concerned. Specimens have been received from about ten different
sources. Of the greatest value are the skulls of ziphioid whales col-
lected by Dr. Stejneger in Bering Island, and representing three genera,
Berardius, Ziphius, and Mesoplodon. A skull of Berardius from New
Zealand was purchased from Mr. Ward, of Rochester, in order that the
proper comparisons might be made. The Zoological Museum of Oxford
University, through Professor Moseley, presented a cast of the beak
132 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

and teeth of the remarkable ziphioid known as Mesoplodon Layardii.
Not less interesting are the casts of the head type-skins of Prodel-
phinus obscurus and Cephalorhynchus Heavisidei presented by the British
Museum through Dr. Giinther. Two other European institutions, the
Royal College of Surgeons (Prof. W. H. Flower) and the Cambridge Uni-
versity Zoological Museum (Mr. John W. Clarke) presented specimens of
cetacea, namely, skeletons of the blackfish and common bottle-nosed
dolphin. The U.S. Fish Commission captured several porpoises, and
presented in addition the skull of the large fin-back whale (Balenop-
tera). The curator was also instructed to investigate the porpoise
fisheries of Hatteras and Cape May, and trom each locality brought
skeletons of the bottle-nosed dolphin, Tursiops tursio. He also pur-
_chased in Europe and presented to the Museum the skulls of three im-
portant species of the Delphinida.

Sirenians.—The chief addition to the specimens representing this
order was a Skeleton of a very large Florida manatee.

DOMESTIC ANIMALS.

The curator has long had in view the assembling of a series of mounted
skins and skeletons of the different races of the dog and other domestic
animals. Considerable material has already accumulated, and during
the year four dogs were added to the series. These were a St. Ber-
nard dog from Messrs. Jacobs (of Washington), a Laverack setter from
Mr. Schneider (of Washington), a Chinese hairless dog from Mr. Buchs-
baum (of Washington), and an Eskimo dog from the Greely Relief

Expedition.
‘ ROUTINE WORK.

Work upon the general collection of the department (both the ex-
hibition and study series) suffered almost complete cessation, from
two very important causes. The curator was given permission to pur-
sue certain studies in Europe during the winter of 1883-84, and did not
return to Washington until May. Very soon after his return the ap-
propriations for the New Orleans Exhibition were made by Congress,
and this department, together with others in the Museum, entered upon
the work of preparing a series of specimens worthy of exhibition at
that exposition. This work practically occupied the attention of the
entire staff of the department until the close of the year. Time was
found, however, for the performance of a few details of regular work,
and these I will enumerate before entering upon a discussion of the
work performed in connection with the New Orleans Exposition.

WORK IN THE EXHIBITION HALLS.

During the absence of the curator, the question of hanging whale-
skeletons and other similar specimens was settled favorably, and in
consequence the specimens of the hump-back and fin-back whales,
which had encumbered the floor in the east-south range, were suspended

REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF MAMMALS. 133

from the ceiling. The large wall-case of the north side of the same
range was completed early in the year and filled with such specimens
as were ready. <A considerable number of skeletons of the larger
ruminants proved too large to be accommodated in this case, and were
therefore placed temporarily upon the tops of certain of the table-cases.
At the same time a large terraced base was planned for the south side
of the range which should ultimately receive them. This stand has
been very recently completed, and will be occupied early in 1885.

Almost no changes have taken place in the hall devoted to mounted
mammals, except the return of certain seals exhibited at the London
Fisheries Exhibition in 1883, and the removal of others intended for the
New Orleans Exhibition. The cast of the ziphioid whale captured on
the coast of New Jersey in 1883 has been completed, and is suspended
from the ceiling on the east side of the hall. The exhibition series has
been several times carefully examined to preserve it against destruction
by insects.

WORK UPON THE STUDY SERIES.

The study series both of skins and bones have also been carefully
examined to the same end. The collection of alcoholic bats was iden-
tified throughout.

This small amount of progress is not at all commensurate with the
desires of the curator, but it was impracticable to do more under the
cireumstances.

The curator has received no extra assistance in the office during the
year. Mr. W. G. Stimpson has acted at once in the capacity of general
assistant, copyist, and messenger, performing these multiform duties
very faithfully and satisfactorily. The force of taxidermists and osteo-
logical preparators was decidedly increased, the former in connection
with the New Orleans Exhibition, as will be presently noted. Mr.
Hornaday and Mr. Lucas remain in charge of this work as heretofore,
under the direction of the curator. More or less work has been done
for the department, as in former years, by Messrs. Joseph and William
Palmer.

During the absence of the Assistant Director in the summer, the cura-
tor was called upon to act in his stead. He has not been relieved of
the care of the library, which occupies much time.

THE NEW ORLEANS EXPOSITION.

Even before money had been appropriated for this exposition, plans
for a display of the mammalia were under discussion. These were at
first of a very comprehensive character. It was intended that the en-
tire existing mammalian fauna of North America from the Isthmus of
Panama northward should be exhibited species by species, and both by
skins or casts and skeletons, and that some of the more important ex-
tinct fauna should be restored. This plan necessarily suffered much
134 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

modification after a short time, when it was found that neither money,
time, nor materials sufficient to assemble such a collection before the
opening of the exposition were at command.

With the intention, however, of having every important species rep-
resented, the curator visited the establishments of all the principal deal-
ers in natural-history material, and the collection of duplicates in the
Museum was also drawn upon very largely. It was found that only a
very small number of species were anywhere on sale, and that the Mu-
seum must rely upon its own resources. This it was able to do to a very
considerable extent, although it was found necessary to withdraw some
mounted specimens from the regular exhibition series, a proceeding
which the curator carried out with great reluctance.

The force of taxidermists was raised to five, and, in addition, many
small species were sent to Mr. F. S. Webster. The specimens were di-
vided by the chief taxidermist among his assistants, and the work was
done carefully, thoroughly, and in time. Toward the end of fall lack of
funds caused a reduction of the force to three, which somewhat embar-
rassed the work.

During the summer the taxidermists together mounted 68 specimens,
including several large forms, such as a bison, puma, jaguar, beaver,
coyote, &c., which occupied necessarily a great amount of time. In
addition to these, 81 specimens were mounted by Mr. Webster and his
assistants, making in all 149 specimens. A few in each lot were not
sent, while on the other hand 62 specimens were taken from the regular
series of the Museum. The total number of specimens exhibited was
160, representing 150 species and varieties. The series includes all the
North American ruminants except the musk-ox; all the important car-
nivores, both aquatic and terrestrial (especially the fur-bearing family,
Mustelide); all the native beneficial or noxious rodents ; representative
species of porpoises; the manatees; and the more characteristic monkeys,
sloths, bats, and insectivores. In addition a series intended to repre-
sent all the orders of the class mammalia was prepared.

The collection was exhibited in four large cases, except the ruminants,
for which a separate, large, terraced stand was provided. The first case
contained the cats, dogs, bears, &c.; the second the seals and whales;
the third the monkeys, weasels, bats, and insectivores and the first
group of rodents; the fourth, the remainder of the rodents, the eden-
tates, and opossums, and the series representing the orders of mam-
malia. The large terraced stand, as already stated, supported only the
ruminants.

It will be observed that this collection, although considerably smaller
in point of number of specimens than that exhibited at the Centennial
Exposition, still contained representatives of almost the same number of
species.

In addition to the specimens already mentioned, another small series
was sent to New Orleans, representing the character of work done in

connection with the section of osteology. It was at first intended that
the different species of mammals should be as well represented by skel-
etons as by mounted skins, but this plan was in the end found imprac-
ticable and was finally abandoned.

Although the performance of so considerable amount of work for a
special purpose has kept the regular work of the department in abey-
ance, it is hoped that the Museum may benefit by it ultimately, both by
the addition of the mounted specimens to its exhibition series and on
account of the experience gained by the taxidermists in.rapid work.

INVESTIGATIONS PROSECUTED DURING THE YEAR 1884.

During the winter of 1883 and the spring of 1884 the curator was
_ engaged in studies upon the cetacea in the European museums. Find-
ing it very difficult to identify the material which has accumulated in
the department of mammals, he conceived the idea of examining for
himself the types of Gray and other writers, which are still extant in
the museums of Europe. With this intent, and also for the purpose of
studying certain details of museum installation, he visited the following
establishments: Royal College of Surgeons, London; British Museum
of Natural History, London; University Zoological Museum, Cambridge;
University Zoological Museum, Oxford; Norwich Museum; Public
Museum of Science and Art, Liverpool; Museum of Art and Industry,
Edinburgh; Museum d’Histoire Naturelle, Paris; Zoological Museum,
Leyden, and a number of less important institutions. The types of
toothed cetaceans of Gray, Flower, Cuvier, Gervais, Schlegel, and
others were examined and measured. The report upon this investiga-
tion is unfortunately still unpublished, owing to the pressure of other
work, but it is the intention of the curator that it shall be finished and
sent to the printer at an early date.

These studies are intended as a basis for a monograph of the toothed
whales of North America, preparations for which are already well
advanced. The collection of cetacea in the National Museum is unques-
tionably the finest in America, and includes a large number of type-
specimens. The work can therefore be partially completed without ref-
erence to other collections, although the latter must in the end be con-
sulted.

The necessary work upon the cetacea is so great that the curator
scarcely hopes to be able to extend his researches upon the mammalia in
other directions for the present.

In addition to the insectivores sent to Dr. G. I. Dobson, of a
England, in 1883, a large number of shrews have been confided to his
care for comparison with the great series already in his hands. The
family Soricide will be treated of in the third and concluding part of
his work upon the insectivores, the first two sections of which have
already appeared.
136 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

Dr. Harrison Allen, of Philadelphia, still continues in possession of
® portion of the Smithsonian collection of Chiroptera, for use in his
studies upon the organs of locomotion in this group. Certain other
specimens of bats were temporarily loaned to Mr. F. W. Cragin, of
Manhattan, Kansas, who is engaged in work upon the species native to
that State.

With the completion of the work upon the cetacea and insectivores
of North America now in progress, the time will be ripe for the publi-
cation of an encyclopedic systematic work upon the entire mammalian
fauna of North America, similar to that published by Professor Baird
in 1859. After such a work shall have been published attention will
doubtless be turned toward the anatomy, physiology, and embryology
of the different species, concerning which very little has thus far been
written.

Papers published in 1884 by the curator and by others connected
with the department, or upon the basis of material belonging to the de-
partment, amount to twelve, and are referred to in the bibliography
under True, Elliott, and Nelson.

PRESENT CONDITION OF THE COLLECTION.

The collection of mammals can at present be divided into but two
series, namely, (1) the exhibition series, and (2) the stored or duplicate
series.

The exhibition series—The number of mounted skins on exhibition
at the close of 1883 and 1884, respectively, was as follows: On exhibi-
tion at the close of 1888, 715; on exhibition at the close of 1884, 646.

It will appear somewhat surprising at first that at the end of a new
year’s work by the taxidermists the number of specimens on exhibi-
tion should be less than previously. The reason of this becomes very
obvious, however, when it is remembered that not only the specimens
mounted during the year were sent to New Orleans, but, in addition,
some that had previously been on exhibition in the hall. If we add to
the number given above, the specimens sent to New Orleans and those
now in the taxidermists’ shops in a nearly completed state the total
reaches 864, which represents a somewhat less number than will be on
exhibition in July, 1885, but many more than were displayed at the
close of 1883.

Duplicate series.—To gain an idea of the present size of this series
it is only necessary to add to the figures given in last year’s report the
number of accessions for 1884, since no distributions have been made.
The totals are as follows:

Although no distributions have been made during the year, a consid-
erable number of specimens have been temporarily loaned for study.
These are as follows:

To Dr. G. E. Dobson, Netley, England..... 35 specimens = 35 species
To F. W. Cragin, Manhattan, Kans........ 17 specimens = 17 species
To Godman & Salvin, London, England.... 16 specimens = 16 species

MSAD 5 tse as: ct da erckin aeteae oehesiae 68 specimens = 68 species

RECOMMENDATIONS AND GENERAL REMARKS.

In the exhibition series the original idea of having the North Ameri-
can fauna exhaustively represented is still adhered to; but, in addition,
every effort is being made to procure as many representative exotic
forms as possible.

During the coming year the taxidermists will be engaged in mount-
ing the skins now in bath, beginning with the primates and following
through each lower order. By this plan the curator is saved a great
amount of labor in identifying and labeling the specimens, since it
enables him to deal with one branch of the literature at a time. It also
facilitates the work of estimating the number of new cases of each style
needed, and makes the growth of the collection apparent.

Some provision must shortly be made for the protection of the larger
species, of which the Museum possesses some very fine and also unique
specimens. It is perhaps not too much to say that no museum in the
world has yet successfully solved the problem of proper casing for the
large mammalia, and it is evident, therefore, that a great amount of
thought must be bestowed upon the subject if this Museum is to sneceed
where others have failed.

During the coming year the organization of the Department of Com-
parative Anatomy will probably be effected. A large number of speci-
mens of the viscera of mammals have been accumulated, in the hope
that they may be of service in the formation of a comparative organo-
logical collection.

By a change in the location of the offices of the department, the
curator hopes to be able to place a reference series, especially of the North
American mammalia, where it will be more readily accessible than hith-
erto. In the present cramped condition neither books nor specimens
can be consulted without great inconvenience and loss of time.

V.—REPORT UPON THE DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS IN THE U. S.
MUSEUM, 1884.

By RoBert RipGway, Curator.

The year 1884 was wholly unprecedented in the extent, if not in the
number, of accessions to the collections of the Department of Birds, and
the amount of work accomplished by the curator and his assistants.
To the latter are due especial mention, as follows:

Capt. Charles E. Bendire, U. 8S. A., who gratuitously rendered most
valuable service in the entire rearrangement and labeling of the oolog-
ical collection, a labor requiring his personal supervision during seven
months. Mr. C. W. Beckham, who until July 1 assisted Captain Ben-
dire in the arrangement and cataloguing of the oological collection, and
after that date rendered efficient aid in the preparation of the New
Orleans exhibit. Mr. Henry Marshall, taxidermist of the department,
whose skilled work added many attractive specimens to the exhibition
series. Mr. George Marshall, engaged after July 1 as assistant taxider-
mist. Miss Harriet S. Perkins, assigned specially to the oological sec-
tion, and who has therein rendered very efficient service. Mr. C. W.
Shoemaker, who performed various clerical duties until December 1,
when lack of funds necessitated his being dropped from the rolls. Mr.
Hugh M. Smith, who performed with great satisfaction the various du-
ties assigned him during his term of service, which extended from July
1to Decemberl. Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, who, appointed as assistant
on the New Orleans exhibit from July 1 until December 1, and after the
latter date as assistant curator, rendered most valuable service to the
department.

ACCESSIONS 10 THE BIRD COLLECTION.
. (a) Skins and alcoholic specimens.

The number of birds, chiefly skins, which were added to the collee-
tion during 1884 is 8,142 (Museum register Nos. 93092-101233), by far
the largest number received in one year in the history of the Museum.
The more important accessions were the following :—

Aiken, O. E., Colorado Springs, Colo.: 14 specimens, 3 species, from
Colorado. (Purchased.)

Batty, J. H., Parkville, Long Island, N. Y.: 50 specimens, 34 species,
from Europe, Peru, and various parts of the United States. (Exchange.)

Belding, L., Stockton, Cal.: 13 specimens, 5 species, from San Diego,
Cal. (Gift.)

. 4 species from Lower California and an interesting series of
Passerculus beldingi (sp. nov.) from San Diego. (Gift.)

Bendire, Capt. Charles E., U. S. A.: 304 specimens, 92 species, from
Fort Klamath, Oreg. (Gift.)

Benedict, J. E., and Nye, W., Jr., U. S. Fish Commission : 94 speci-
mens, 44 species, collected during the cruise of the Fish Commission
steamer Albatross, at St. Thomas, W.I1., on the islands of Trinidad,
Mona, Curagoa, and Old Providence, and at Sabanilla, New Granada.
Of the 10 species collected at Curagoa and Old Providence, 8 were new
to science. A pair of the interesting oil bird or guacharo (Steatornis
caripensis) were collected at Mona Island. (See notice of special paper
on this collection, in list of papers based on material in the National
Museum collection. )

Bergen Museum, Bergen, Norway (through Dr. L. Stejneger): 78 speci-
mens, 45 species, chiefly from Norway. (Exchange.)

Berlepsch, Count von, Muenden, Germany : 81 specimens, 66 species, of
neotropical birds, many of them new to the collection; also, 20 speci-
mens, 18 species, from Malacca—nearly all previously unrepresented.
(Exchange.)

Bicknell, Eugene P., Riverdale. N. Y.: Pair of Hylocichla alicie bick-
nelli; new to the collection. (Gift.)

149 species from Japan, 76 from China, 63 from England, 3 from Kamt-
schatka, 2 from India; total 293 species. (Gift.) (This collection is
specially important, having been made during a 20 years’ residence in
Japan, and forming the basis of Captain Blakiston’s various papers—
also those of other writers—on the birds of that country. Its acqui-
siticn, together with the collection made by Mr. P. L. Jouy, renders the
National Museum collection of Japanese birds perhaps the most com-
plete extant.)

birds’ eggs, numbering nearly 8,000 specimens, generously presented
by Captain Bendire to the National Museum, and catalogued and
arranged under his direct supervision. The more important of other
accessions are the following:

SPECIAL WORK ACCOMPLISHED.

Unpacking and redistributing the collection of birds sent to the London
International Fisheries Exhibition—The return of several large boxes
of specimens of aquatic and fish-eating birds, sent to the London Inter-
national Fisheries Exhibition, necessitated a large amount of labor in
unpacking and redistributing the same to their respective drawers.
This collection embraced 380 specimens, representing 220 species.

Selection of birds for the museum of the Indiana State University.—The
natural history collections of the Indiana State University having been
totally destroyed by fire in July, 1883, the National Museum undertook
to replace, in a measure, the ornithological collection of that establish-
ment. For this purpose a considerable number of duplicate mounted
specimens were available, and in order to get at these it was necessary
to unpack some dozen or more large boxes which had been kept in the
storage rooms, and then repack and invoice the residue. The total
number of specimens, chiefly mounted, which were thus disposed of
amounted to 564, representing 395 species.

Researches connected with a new list of North American birds.—The
curator of the department having been charged by the Committee on
Classification and Nomenclature of the American Ornithologists’ Union
to determine certain. doubtful questions of synonymy among North
American birds, for the proposed new list to be published by the
Union, he has spent much time in investigating the various complicated
questions pertaining tothis work. In this labor he has been materially
assisted by Dr. Leonhard Stejneger.

Rearrangement of the collection of larger water birds, &de—Four new
large “Salvin” cabinets having been provided for the accommodation
of a portion of the collection of larger birds, the latter, which had been
packed in various inconvenient and unsafe receptacles, chiefly large
packing boxes, were unpacked and rearranged in the drawers of the
new cabinets.

Installation of mounted specimens.—A large number of specimens
which had accumulated during the occupancy of the alcoves between
the exhibition cases in the main hall by the Smithsonian offices, while
the east end of the building was undergoing repairs, was distributed
through the cases after the alcoves were cleared, it having until then
been impossible to gain access to the cases.
REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS. 151

Moving the office of the curatom—The former quarters of the curator
in the top of the south tower proving, under the large increase of busi-
‘ness in the department, no longer suitable for the purpose, the south-
west gallery of the main hall was, at the curator’s suggestion, cleared
and fitted up for temporary occupancy. The labor of moving the fur-
niture, &e., of the curator’s office to the new quarters was very consid-
erable, involving, among other things, the transfer of 27 quarter-unit
cases and 11 walnut cabinets, with their contents (embracing some
30,000 specimens).

Selection of specimens for mounting.—About 2,500 skins were selected
for mounting, to add to the exhibition series of the Museum. Of this
number somewhat over 1,200, chiefly small birds, were mounted; but
the remainder are put aside to be mounted as opportunity permits.

Preparation of copy for labels for the exhibition collection.—Copy for
considerably over 1,000 species-labels for the mounted birds was pre-
pared during the year, said labels to give the English name (in large,
heavy type) of each species, the various local or popular names, the
scientific name, the range, a reference to where a full account of the
habits, ete., can be found, and other information specially desired by
the general public. All the North American and a considerable number
of the foreign species have been thus covered. A sample copy of this
label is herewith submitted:

Transfer of mounted specimens to new walnut stands.—Several hundred
of the mounted specimens were during the year transferred to new
black-walnut stands, and the beauty of the collection thus materially
increased.

* New Orleans exhibit.—By far the larger part of the work done from
July to November, inclusive, consisted in the preparation of an exhibit
of birds for the World’s International Cotton Exposition at New Orleans.
It was at first intended to send a selected series of birds from all parts*
of the world, in order to show the more characteristic types of each ot
the primary zodgeographical divisions of the earth. This plan was,
however, found not feasible, owing partly to the large expense involved
in the purchase of specimens not already in the collection, but chiefly
to the lack of sufficient space in the exhibition building. Lt was finally
152 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

determined, therefore, to restri@t the exhibit to a collection of North
American game-birds, of which 171 specimens (a large number of them
mounted specially for the occasion), representing 123 species, were
sent. These were installed by Dr. L. Stejneger, assistant curator.
This collection embraces, with a few unimportant exceptions, all the
North American species of the turkey, grouse, and partridge families,
besides all the species of swans, geese, and ducks, shore-birds, &ce., of
Eastern North America, all accurately labeled with both their English
and scientific names.

Publications.—The total number of papers published during 1884 which
were based exclusively or in part on the bird collection of the National
Museum is 60, embracing about 450 octavo pages, and of books, 3 vol-
umes, two royal 8vo, with a total of 1,096 pages, and one imperial octavo
of 893 pages.

PRESENT STATE OF THE COLLECTION.
(a) Mounted and alcoholic specimens and skins.

Condition.—In all respects except the manner of installation of the
exhibition series, and some inconveniences of arrangement resulting
trom insufficient storage facilities, the present condition of the collec-
tion is excellent. No injury has been done by insects, owing in part to
the tight-fitting cases in which the principal part of the skin collection
is kept and to the close surveillance kept over those specimens to which
insects could gain access. Bisulphide of carbon has been freely used in
all the drawers, close-fitting and otherwise, and any infected specimens
discovered were at once quarantined and fumigated. The collection is
in very urgent need of better accommodations, however, aS is more
fully explained under the head of ‘* Recommendations.”

Extent.—It was found impracticable to make an actual inventory of
the collections at the end of 1884, on account of the pressure of numer-
ous other duties. But the following estimate, based on the inventory
for 1883 and the number of specimens received and distributed during
the past year, may be considered as approximately correct :

REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS 153

Bendire presented to the National Museum his unique collection of
North American birds’ eggs, numbering nearly 8,000 beautifully pre-
pared specimens, representing unrivaled series of many very rare
species, besides a number not previously represented in the Museum.
This valuable collection was incorporated with that of the Museum, the
two thus combined being entirely rearranged after the sequence of
species given in the latest edition of the “Smithsonian” catalogue of
North American birds (Bulletin U.S. National Museum, No. 21), and
neatly packed in glass-topped drawers, between strips of cotton batting.
The collection is arranged in 5 unit cases and 154 drawers, besides va-
rious other temporary receptacles.

A complete census of the egg collection has been made by Miss Per-
kins, assisted by Mr. Hugh M. Smith. The total number of eggs, ex-
clusive of those in nests, which were not counted, is 40,072, distributed
as follows :

RECOMMENDATIONS.

Cases for the exhibition series.—By far the most urgent need of the
department of birds is the want of suitable cases for the arrangement of
the exhibition collection. The main purpose of this collection being the
entertainment and instruction of the general public, it is due the latter
that this, to them most important, portion of the collections should be
exhibited in a manner which will afford them the means of deriving both
pleasure and instruction from its inspection. Ln its present condition the
exhibition series of birds is not only not in keeping with the dignity of
the National Museum, but it is actually and deservedly the subject of
much unfavorable comment. With the cases at present provided it is
not possible to arrange the collection in any attractive manner, even
were the number of cases sufficient for its accommodation. The Ameri-
can Museum of Natural History in New York City is able, on account
of its large, well-lighted, and admirably constructed cases, to make a
display of the most diversified forms of the feathered creation, with
which the bird exhibit of the National Museum cannot be compared,
except to its discredit. 1 would most earnestly recommend that the
154 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

evil be remedied at as early a date as practicable by the construe:
tion of new cases or the repair and modification of those now in use. |
The National Museum possesses material, in the form of beautifully
mounted specimens and unmounted hes from which in a short time)
could be built a collection for popular instruction far superior to any in)
America, and for beauty and utility, if not in extent, unsurpassed by
any in Europe. # |

Labels for the exhibition collection.—Next to the evil discussed abo ve
is the absence of suitable labels for the specimens in the exhibitio;
series. All are provided with the usual Museum label, upon which isi
recorded in full the data pertaining to each. But these labels, ev on:
when not fastened beneath the stands, are of no use to the publi¢«
The latter require a label upon which they may find in conspicuo 181
typography the name of the bird before them (particularly its Euglisl
name, if the species have one) and other similar facts. ‘To meet this
requirement a form of label has been invented by the curator upon whieh’
is printed, first, in large, heavy-face type, the English name of the
species; second, in smaller type, the various popular or local names ‘
by which it ig ae third, in medium heavy-face type, the scientific
name ; and, fourth, a en statement of the range or habita
In the case of species having notable characteristics or of special eco-
nomic importance, the facts are briefly but concisely mentioned. The:
copy for labels for all the species of North American birds is completed L
ready for the printer, as is also that for a large number of exotic species, Ml
and I would earnestly recommend that these be printed as soon as)
practicable. (See sample label exhibited on page 151 of this report. a .

Transfer of mounted specimens to new stands.—Most of the larger birds
in the mounted collection have been transferred to new walnut stan ds
ot the adopted model; but there still remains a considerable numb or,
and much the greater 2s of the Smaller specimens, which are yet on

ee A sufficient number of new stands is on hand for the
specimens which are yet to be transferred, and I would respectfully
recommend that the completion of the work be assigned to some com
petent person, under the direction and supervision of the curator. —

Taxidermists laboratory——The laboratory of the taxidermist is at
present in need of many repairs and fixtures for facilitating the work
of mounting birds for the exhibition series. Wall-cases with sash- door:
and shelves are needed, as are also other improvements which it is un
necessary to specify hoe g

Additional storage room for specimens.—The bulk of the collection 01 (
birds has increased to such an extent that he cabinets thus far pro”

one. At least three more of the large “Salvin” cabinets are urgen Ly
REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF BIRDS. 155

needed for the larger birds, and an equal number of quarter-unit cases
for snfaller specimens.

Additions to the exhibition series.—The exhibition series being intended
for the purpose of popular instruction, it is therefore obvious that ajudi-
cious selection of the objects to be exhibited is highly desirable. No end
is served by the presentation of many species of one family of birds,
or a large number which appeal inno way to the interest of the general
public. Apart from the North American collection, which, in the in-
terest of students, should be made complete as possible, the exhibition
collection should consist of birds remarkable for beauty of plumage or
peculiarities of structure, or interesting from their association with
literature or history, or from their economic value. During a recent in-
spection of the American Museum of Natural History in New York
City, the curator made a list of more than 100 species of foreign birds
which constitute the chief attraction of that superb museum, all of
which are wanting to the national collection. There are also required
for the purposes of scientific research many forms which can be ob-
tained only by purchase, the want of which has greatly impeded the
scientific work of those who have made the collections of the National
Museum the basis of their scientific investigations. It is earnestly
recommended, therefore, that these species (a list which the curator
hopes shortly to present) be purchased as soon as the finances of the
Museum will allow.

Ornithological library.— Not less pressing than the acquisition of
special desiderata in the way of specimens is the need of a better
working library for the Department of Birds. There are many books,
some of which are in almost every public library of importance in the -
country, and even in not a few private libraries—but not in that of
the National Museum or of Congress—which are indispensable to the
working ornithologist. These should be supplied at as early a date as
possible.

Additional assistants —The work of the department has increased
so rapidly within the last few years, that with his present force the
curator cannot keep abreast of his duties as they accumulate and at
the same time carry on the improvements in the condition of the col-
lection which are necessary to its preservation and utility. Two addi-
tional aids are needed, both of whom should be persons who would
have a lively interest in their work, one to act as messenger and general
assistant, the other to perform necessary clerical duties.
VI.—REPORT UPON THE DEPARTMENT OF HERPETOLOGY IN
— ‘THE U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM FOR THE YEAR 1884.

By H. C. Yarrow, M. D., Honorary Curator.

_ During the past year, as in previous years, the Department of Rep-
tiles has been abundantly favored by many contributors whose interest
in herpetology has led them to make valuable and extensive collections,
and both the reserve and general series have been consequently much
enlarged and made more valuable for purposes of comparison and study.
Among the most noteworthy of the donations received may be men-
tioned the following: From Capt. Charles Bendire, U.S. A., who for
many years has been a most devoted friend to the establish sine has been
eceived a large and valuable collection from Fort Klamath bey vicinity,
Washington Territory. Mr. Charles H. Townsend, of Baird, Shasta
Couty, California, has sent in an extremely interesting collection of
the characteristic reptiles of that vicinity. Mr. C. J. Hering, of Suri-
nam, a large contributor in previous years, has also presented a valu-
able collection of exotic reptiles, and from the scientific gentlemen of the
Fish Commission steamer, Albatross, a large collection made during the
cruise in the West Indies in 1884, comprising over one hundred speci-
mens, has been received. This econ has been loaned, by direction
of Professor Baird, to Prof. E. D. Cope, of Philadelphia, for study and
identification; the resuits will be probably embodied in a forthcoming
paper by this distinguished naturalist on tropical herpetology. From
Lieut. George F. Chase, U. 8. A., Fort Thomas, Arizona, have been re-
ceived two living examples of the “Gila monster,” Heloderma suspectum,
pe, these having been sent by special request to furnish additional
‘material for Dr. S. Weir Mitchell’s researches upon the venom of this
interesting lizard. Collections have also been received from R, Ells-
worth Call, Des Moines, Iowa, and a particularly valuable one from F.
W. Nelson, Tucson, Arizona.
_ During the months of August and September, 1884, the curator, be-
ing in charge of a small party for scientific research sent out by direction
of the Secretary of War, had an opportunity of collecting many valu-
able aad interesting specimens of reptiles in the Territory of Utah,
supplementing in this manner the collections made by him in 1872 while

Director of the Museum one of his assistants in the Department of Rep-
tiles accompanied him, and by permission of General McCook, U.S. A.,
Lieut. B. W. Atkinson, Sixth United States Infantry, also joined the
party; both gentlemen rendered valuable assistance. A small appro-
priation was made to further the objects of the expedition.

Other collections have been received from José C. Zelodon, of Costa
Rica; B. V. Archer, Key West, Fla.; Prof. D. S. Jordan, Bloomington,
Ind.; Dr. B. G. Lartigue, of South Carolina; Miss Rosa Smith, San
Diego, Cal.; James Bell, Gainesville, Fla.; John and Charles Walker,
Olney, Richland County, Illinois; H. C. Orcutt, San Diego, Cal.; R. E.
C. Stearns, Auburn, Cal.; F. W. Hayden, Canada; Gustave Kohn, New
Orleans, La.; W. A. Conklin, superintendent Central Park Museum, New
York; J. Richardson, Rutland, Vt.; D. S. Sheldon, Griswold College,
Davenport, Iowa; Charles R. Orcutt, San Diego, Cal.; Charles H. Town-
send, Red Bluff, Cal.; H. W. Turner, San Francisco, Cal.; Maj. G. E.
Dobson, Surgeon Royal Victoria Hospital, Netley, England; H.W. Hen-
shaw, Massachusetts; and R. Ridgway, Wheatland, Ind. From this ex-
tended list it will be seen that the public interest in the Reptile Depart-
ment is constantly increasing. We are also under great obligations to’
Professor Snow, of the Kansas University, who loaned us a unique and
beautiful specimen of Crotalus lepidus, which has been drawn as one of
the illustrations for the Manual of Herpetology in course of preparation
by the curator.

As was mentioned by the curator in his last annual report, the routine
work of the department has been transacted by himself and two assist-
ants, both of whom are already possessed of considerable knowledge
regarding reptiles. The ordinary routine is as follows: All collections
received are at once numbered with a metallic tag and entered in the
accession book, having been previously identified if possible. They are
then, after a careful examination, placed in either the reserve or the
general series, an additional record being made, in order that in case a
specimen is needed it may be at once found according to its classifica-
tion. In explanation of the terms ‘reserve series” and “ general series”
it may be said that the entire collection of American reptiles is divided
into two great parts, one called the ‘‘ Reserve Series,” intended for pur-
poses of study and comparison, and from which is selected the exhibi-
tion set, the other entitled the *‘ General Series,” from which selections
are made for donations to other museums or to amplify the ‘‘ Reserve
Series.” It is to be greatly regretted that proper space is not available
to admit of a proper display of series of both domestic and foreign
reptiles.

It has long been the intention of the curator to arrange in the same
manner the collection of foreign reptiles, but in the present crowded
condition of the curator’s room it has been found impossible to do this
properly.

The following records, in addition to the current record, are kept with

sat care and exactitude, and are necessitated by the business of the
p artment, which has greatly increased in magnitude during the last
pycars. These records are as follows:

ecord of reserve series.

ord of general series.

ord of letters received.

ecord of letters sent.

ecord of requisitions.

n these may be found every matter of business transacted in the
apartment of Reptiles.

No little labor is involved in attending promply to tie official cor-
| sl ondence, which is quite voluminous at times, for letters of inquiry
received from all parts of the world, to answer which, require much
tudy, thought, and labor. During fie year 1884 over two hundred
ters were received and answered, and many were written in addi-
‘he long-cherished desire of the curator to have prepared a card-cat-
gue of the collection of reptiles is now in a fair way toward realiza-
i, aS a commencement has been made and over a thousand speci-
ns have been examined, verified, and recorded. This, in view of the
sular work, which was arduous in 1884, is considered a good begin-
ic.

The manuscript of a Manual of Herpetology (mentioned in last year’s
ort) by the curator, could be put into the hands of the printer within
bort period if the illustrations were all completed. Owing to a want
funds, further work upon these has been stopped.

No special work has been attempted this year apart from the routine
ities and field researches.

At the present time the collection is in excellent condition, which
uld be much improved were more space available. Although since
scember 1, 1884, the business of the Reptile Department has been
sed by the furloughing of both assistants, still constant attention is
ven in order that the specimens may not perish for want of suitable

160 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884

Since his connection with the National Museum, in an honorary
capacity, the curator has repeatedly called attention to the fact that
without additional accommodation for his department it would be im-
possible to so arrange the collection as to make it of much practical
value, and it is now with a desponding spirit that he again urges that
something may be done for relief. All the available shelf-space is
overcrowded, specimens have to be placed on the floor or in an adjoining
hall, and much material that is valuable is hidden away in clumsy tanks,
deposited in almost inaccessible corners.

Owing to other and important official duties, it is impossible for
the curator to give his entire time to reptilian work, and without
assistance the department will gradually merge into the condition it
was when he first took charge of it. With becoming deference he
thinks this should not be permitted ; an enormous amount of work has
been expended in the department, and, with pardonable pride, he thinks

that under the circumstances it compares most favorably with any of

the other departments in the National Museum.

It must be conceded by all who have looked into this subject that the
Reptile Department is of quite as much importance to the Museum and
to the scientific public as any of the other departments, and for this
reason the curator again respecttually calls the attention of the Director
to his recommendation of last year, that the person in charge should be
a salaried officer, and be required to give his entire time to the duties
of his office. This the present curator cannot do, and it will therefore
be understood that no motive of self-interest prompts him in this sug-
gestion.

By addition we would have a larger number of accessions than 93;
but, in some cases, the accession was partly from one locality and partly
from another, and each is credited as one in the synopsis.
: Following is a summary of the most interesting accessions catalogued
during the year, 34 in number:

species, represented in most cases by a sufficient number of excellent
specimens. As might have been expected, his collection is rich in
Salmonoids, including six species. One of the most interesting of the
species is a char, which I suppose to be Salvelinus stagnalis; this is
remarkable for its enormous size, almost rivaling that of the Maine
salmon. Among the rarer species obtained by Mr. Turner are the fol-
lowing : Cottus scorpioides, Cyclopterus spinosus, Sticheus punctatus, and
Somniosus microcephalus.

REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF FISHES. 165

A collection of Jamaican fishes, including nearly one hundred spe-
cies, sent here in duplicate for identification, by the Kingston Public
Museum of Jamaica, was attended to. This is an important accession
to the collection of fishes.

The fresh-water fishes were all removed to the west basement, where
Prof. D. S. Jordan, during the months of July and August, worked
over the entire collection, verifying the old identifications and re-ar-
ranging the collections generally. Many of these fishes were found to
be absolutely worthless, and consequently were thrown away.

A journal relating to the fishes of Wood’s Holl, Mass., and vicinity,
kept by Mr. V. N. Edwards, from 1872 to 1880, is being revised for pub-
lication.

The large accessions required considerable attention, especially those
from the deep sea. On account of the large number of gifts numerous
lists were made for the donors and other information concerning the
fishes was furnished.

During the mouths of July and August my time was mostly taken up
with editorial work.

I left Washington for Patchogue, Great South Bay, N. Y., with two
of my assistants, Messrs. Bean and Dresel, on the 2d of September.
We spent about six weeks collecting fishes, principally marine species,
in Great South Bay and the ponds in the vicinity of Patchogue.

The work upon the bottled collection of marine fishes was commenced,
and the different series will be made up as rapidly as possible.

There is, of course, some material which must be called distinctly bad,
but the amount is becoming less and less every day.

RECOMMENDATIONS AND GENERAL REMARKS.

The duplicate fishes should be disposed of as soon as the sets can be
made up.

There should also be some instructions to collectors, cautioning them
against shipping large numbers of fishes belonging to well-known species.

Some provisions should be made for a proper storage of the skele-
tons of fishes, which are now lying in boxes, where they are inacces-
sible.

I take pleasure in referring again to the assistance which I have de-
rived from the following-named gentlemen in my work upon the fishes:
Mr. Barton A. Bean, Ensign H. G. Dresel, U. S. N., and Mr. Peter
Parker, jr. Without the valuable help of these gentlemen much of the
work which has been accomplished would have remained undone.

The Museum is to be congratulated also upon the addition to its
corps of artists of Miss Mary M. Smith, of Bainbridge, Pa. Through
the help of Mr. H. L. Todd and Miss Smith we are now able to produce
very satisfactory illustrations of fishes.

I herewith append a statement, prepared by Prof. D. S. Jordan, re-
garding the collections of fishes made by himself under the auspices of
the Smithsonian Institution, the Museum, and the Fish Commission.
The collecting expedition of 1834 is of special value, being probably
the most extensive yet undertaken in the fresh waters of the United
States. The object of this exploration was the gathering together of a
collection of fresh-water tishes to be exhibited by the National Museum
at New Orleans.

A RECORD OF COLLECTIONS OF FISHES MADE UNDER THE
AUSPICES OF THE U.S. FISH COMMISSION AND THE U.
S. NATIONAL MUSEUM, FROM 1875 TO 1885.

By Davib 8S. JORDAN.

For the past ten years the writer has been engaged in a special study
of the distribution of fishes in the waters of North America. In this
study he has had occasion to do a good deal of field work in the collec-
tion of and preservation of fishes. In this he has been aided by sey-
eral students and associates, especially by Mr. Charles H. Gilbert, now
professor of biology in the University of Cincinnati.

All this work has been carried on under the auspices of the U.S.

National Museum and the U.S. Fish Commission. It has been per-
formed, in a greater or less degree, under the direction of Professor
Baird, and in all cases most of the material obtained, including the
types of all new species, has been sent to the U.S. National Museum.
170 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 18834.

The amount of financial assistance received from Government sources
has varied very much. At times (1880-’84) it has amounted to consid-
erably more than the actual expenses of exploration and collection.
At other times it has simply met the cost of the alcohol used. Aid of
varying amount has also been given by Butler University and, since
1879, by the University of Indiana. These details are, however, foreign
to the present purpose. [here give a brief account of the different
excursions for field work in ichthyology, made by my associates and
myself, with a list of the localities explored.

1875.

In the spring and fall of 1875, extensive collections were made in
White River and its tributaries about Indianapolis, by the late Prof.
Herbert E. Copeland and myself. <A list of the species obtained is
published in the Annals of the Lyceum of Natural History, of New York,
1877, pp. 375-377. Some collections were also made by Professor Cope-
land in Wisconsin and by myself at the Falls of the Ohio and about

Cumberland Gap.
1876.

In the summer of 1876 I made an extended collecting tour in the
Southern States, accompanied by Mr. Charles H. Gilbert, who was then
a botanical student under Professor Copeland. A small collection was
obtained in the Rock Castle River, at Livingston, Ky. About three
weeks were spent by us at Rome, Ga. Here the streams tributary to
the Etowah, Oostanaula, and Coosa Rivers were very thoroughly ex-
plored. A few days were also spent at Flat Shoals, on South River, a
tributary of the Ocmulgee, southeast of Atlanta. Small collections
were also made in Peach Tree Creek and in Nancy’s Creek, tributaries
of the Chattahoochee, near Atlanta.

This expedition represents the first attempt to study the fresh-water
fishes of Georgia, and the collection then made is much larger than
any since obtained in that State. The results of this summer’s work
have been published by me, under the title of “A Partial Synopsis of
the Fishes of Upper Georgia,” in the Annals of the Lyceum of Natural
History of New York, XI, 1877, p. 307 et seq.

1877.

In 1877 a more extended tour in the Alleghany region of the Southern
States was undertaken by the writer, with the assistance of Dr. Alem-
bert W. Brayton and Mr. Gilbert. Numerous streams were examined,
representing the following hydrographic basins: Santee, Savannah,
Altamaha, Chattahoochee, Alabama, Tennessee, Cumberland. A de- |
tailed report of these explorations was-published by Jordan and Bray-
ton in Bulletin XII of the U. S. National Museum, 1878, under the title,
‘On the Distribution of the Fishes of the Alleghany Region of South

£ REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF FISHES. Ltt

- Carolina, Georgia, and Tennessee, with Descriptions of New or Little

*

Known Species.” An extended discussion of the distribution of fresh-
water fishes is given in this paper, pp. 91-95.

1878.

In 1878 I spent some time at Beaufort, N. C., in the study of the
marine fishes of that port. Im my work here | was assisted by Dr.
Brayton, Mr. Gilbert, and Mr. Bb. W. Evermann. A catalogue of the
species obtained was published in the Proceedings of the U.S. National
Museum, 1878, pp. 365-388, by Jordan and Gilbert, under the title of
* Notes on the Fishes of Beaufort Harbor, North Carolina.”

1879.

The summer of 1879 was spent in Europe. Considerable collections
were made by Mr. Gilbert and myself at Venice.

1880.

In November, 1879, [ was appointed special agent of the U. S. Census
Bureau, in charge of the enumeration of the fisheries and otber marine

_ interests of the Pacific coast of the United States. I was also in-

structed by the U. S. Commissioner of Fisheries to undertake a thorough

_ study of the fish-fauna of that region, and to make extensive collections

of the fishes for distribution by the U. 8S. National Museum to the chief
museums of the world.

Mr. Charles H. Gilbert was appointed assistant in this work. Special
assistance in Puget Sound was rendered by Mr. James G. Swan, of Neah

_ Bay, and about San Francisco by Mr. William N. Lockington, then of

San Francisco. Important volunteer aid was also given by Miss Rosa

Smith, of San Diego, by Mr. Charles J. Smith, then of Astoria, and by

Capt. Andrea Larco, of Santa Barbara.
Mr. Gilbert and the writer reached San Diego about January 1,1885.
The time between that date and November 1 was devoted to an ex-

_ploration of the coast from the Mexican boundary as far north as Saanich

on Vancouver's Island, most of the important points being visited at,

least twice, at different seasons.

The chief points at which collections were made are San Diego, San
Pedro (Wilmington), Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo (Port Hartford),

Monterey, Soquel, San Francisco, Humboldt Bay, Astoria, Neah Bay,

Seattle, Tacoma, Victoria, Saanich Arm, and New Westminster.
Few coasts have yet been so thoroughly explored, so far as the shore
fishes are concerned. We had, however, no means of collecting fishes

from any great depth. The results of these explorations have been given

in numerous short papers in the Proceedings of the U. 5. National Mu-
seum for 1880 and 1881, in the Synopsis of the Fishes of North America,
andin other papers. Ourreports to the U.S Census Bureau still re-
1%2 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

main unpublished. Some 55 speties new to science were obtained by
this expedition, and the number of species of shore fishes known from
the Pacfie coast of California, Oregon, and Washington was raised from
about 200 to nearly 275. Series of specimens containing each from 50
to 250 of these species have been distributed to some 75 different mu-
seams, in various parts of the world.

The most important result of our work on the Pacific coast is prob-
ably the solution of the problem as to the number of species of salmon
(Oncorhynchus) inhabiting the North Pacific. Similar results were
reached at the same time by Dr. T. H. Bean, who was then carrying on
explorations in Alaska.

On my return to the East I visited Utah Lake. Here, with the assist-
ance of Peter Madsen, a fisherman at Provo, I made a considerable col-
lection of fishes, some of them new to science. These have been deseribed
by Jordan and Gilbert in the Proceedings of the U.S. National Mu-
seum, 1880, 459.

After finishing his work in California in November, 1880, Mr. Gilbert.

continued his explorations southward, spending the winter at Mazatlan
and Panama, returning from Colon to Washington in the spring of 1881.
A remarkably rich and carefully preserved collection was obtained from
the Pacific coast of Mexico and Central America. This included some
60 species new to science. These have been described in several papers
by Jordan and Gilbert in the Proceedings of the U. 8. National Museum
and Bulletin of the U.S. Fish Commisson in 1881 and 1882. An elabo-
rate paper containing synonymy and detailed descriptions of all the

species of fishes known from the Pacific coast of tropical America was —

prepared by us for publication. This was destroyed by tire in 1883 when
nearly ready for the press.
1881.
The summer of 1881 was spent in Kurope. Collections were made in

Genoa and Venice.
1882.

In the spring of 1882 I visited Galveston, New Orleans, and Pensacola, |

making a considerable collection at each point. The most important
part of this collection was that obtained at Pensacola, with the assist-
ance of Mr. Silas Stearns. The collections of fishes made by Mr. Stearns
at Pensacola are among the most important which the National Museum
has received from any source. The results of this expedition were pub-
lished by Jordan and Gilbert in the Proceedings of the U. 8. National
Museum for 1882, pp. 241-307.

Part of the summer of the same year was spent by Professor Gilbert
at Charleston, S. ©. In his work here Professor Gilbert received im-
portant aid from Mr. Charles C. Leslie. The results of his explorations
were published by Jordan and Gilbert in Proceedings of the U.S. Na-
tional Museum, 1882, pp. 580-620.
REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF FISHES. 173
1883.

The winter of 1882~’83 was spent by Professor Gilbert in making col-
lections of fishes at Panama and at neighboring points on both sides of
the Isthmus as well as in the fresh waters of the Isthmus and of Costa

Rica. A large collection obtained was extremely rich in fresh-water

forms and contained some 40 species new to science. It was unfortu-
nately totally destroyed by the burning of the museum building of the
Indiana University, July 12, 1883.

At this time about one-third of the collection previously made by
Professor Gilbert at Mazatlan and Panama was also destroyed, as well
as the private collections of Professor Gilbert and myself, which were
very rich in the department of fishes. Nothing was published concern-
ing these collections of 1883.

In the spring of 1883 a small collection of fishes was made in the
Clear Fork of the Cumberland River by Mr. Joseph Swain and the
writer. After the fire a third collection was made at Venice by Mr.
Swain and myself. Small collections were also obtained at Wood's
Holl, Mass., and in different streams of Indiana.

In November and December, 1883, I undertook a reconnaissance of
the fish-fauna of the Florida Keys. A day was spent at Jacksonville,
Fla., a few days at Cedar Keys, Fla., about three weeks at Key West,
Fla., and nearly two weeks in Havana. In this work I was assisted by
Mr. William H. Dye, a student of Indiana University. Large collec-
tions were obtained, especially at Key West and at Havana—upwards
of 25 species being new to science. The collections made in Florida
have been described in different papers in the Proceedings of the
U.S. National Museum for 1884. Those from Havana have not yet
been placed on record.

1884.

In July 1884 I was asked by Prof. G. Brown Goode, curator of the
U.S. National Museum, to take charge of a series of explorations of the
streams of the Southern States, to be undertaken in connection with
the New Orleans Exposition. In this work I was assisted by Professor
Gilbert, Prof. Joseph Swain, and Mr. Seth E. Meek.

Field work was begun early in July by Professors Gilbert and
Swain in different streams in Indiana. Later they extended their ex-
plorations southward, making collections in the Rolling Fork, the Rock
Castle, Cumberland, Clinch, French Broad, and Stone’s Rivers; later
in the tributaries of the Tennessee, about Florence, Tuscumbia, and
Huntsville, in Alabama, and in those of the Blaek Warrior, about
Cullman, Blount Springs, Warrior, and Tuscaloosa. This exploration
of the Tennessee basin brought to light a number of new forms, espe-
cially in the group of Ltheostomina.

' Meanwhile the writer, assisted by Mr. Seth EH. Meek, began field
work in the Des Moines River, in Southern Iowa. The Des Moines,
174 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

Chariton, and Hundred and Two Rivers, in Iowa, were investigated, —

and the Missouri, La Mine, and Osage, in Missouri. After a time I
was obliged to return to Indiana for a few days, and Professor Gilbert,
with Mr. Meek’s assistance, continued the work in tributaries of the
Neosho, Osage, White, Niangua, and Gasconade, in Southern Missouri.
T rejoined them at Kureka Springs, in Arkansas, where we made large
collections in White River. Here Mr. Meek left us, and Mr. Gilbert
and I proceeded to Fort Smith, where we made collections in Lee’s
Creek, the Poteau River, and the Arkansas. Proceeding southwest-
ward from Little Rock, we explored in succession the Saline River at
Benton, the Washita River at Arkadelphia, the Red River at Fulton,
the Sabine River at Longview, the Trinity River at Dallas, the Lam-
pasas and Leon Rivers at Belton, the Colorado River at Austin, the Rio
Blanco and San Marcos Rivers at San Marcos, and the Rio Comal at
New Braunfels. From New Braunfels we returned to Washington.

The explorations in 1884 are in several respects the most extensive
yet undertaken in the fresh waters of the United States. As results
of the summer’s work a considerable number of new species have been
added to our lists. The range of many species hitherto supposed to be
rare and local has been greatly extended, and numerous species sup-
posed to be well distinguished have been shown to be geographical
varieties of others. We have been enabled in many cases to recognize
subspecies among our fresh-water fishes and to properly distinguish
these from individual and accidental variations. This work cannot be
fully done until all our interior waters have been explored. There still
remain many hydrographic basins in which no collections have yet
been made.

IX.—REPORT UPON THE DEPARTMENT OF MOLLUSKS IN THE
U. S. NATIONAL MUSEUM FOR 1885.

By WititamM H. Dati, Honorary Curator.

The personnel of the department at present is as follows:

William H. Dall, paleontologist to the U.S. Geological Survey, hon-
orary curator.

Robert E. C. Stearns, U. 8S. Geological Survey, assistant curator.

Miss Agnes Nicholson, clerical assistant.

Mr. R. E. Call, temporary assistant.

At the beginning of the year the writer was still occupied by duties
at the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, which engaged him during
the working hours of the day. In June the health of Mr. R. E. C.
Stearns having improved he came on to Washington and accepted a
post in the U.S. Geological Survey which incidentally included work
on the Quaternary fossils and recent allies in the National collection.
He was therefore assigned to duty as assistant curator of the Depart-
ment of Conchology and at once entered upon the work. Owing to the
decision of the Director, in accordance with the requirements of Con-
gress in regard to the New Orleans Exposition, to exhibit a series of
mollusks and shelJs from the Museum, Mr. Stearns was requested by
me to take entire charge of the preparation and organization of the
exhibit. He was very busily engaged until the middle of December in
perfecting and packing the series which was finally dispatched to its
destination. It comprised twenty large table cases exhibiting the
economical mollusks of both coasts and of adjacent seas, the fresh-
water mussels which form so remarkable a part of the fauna of the
great Mississippi Basin, &c., a complete review of which will more ap-
propriately come in, in the report of the year now opening, after the
close of the exhibition.

To assist in this work Mr. R. Ellsworth Call, who has especial knowl-
edge of the land and fresh-water mollusks of North America, was en-

gaged for a period of six months.

In September the curator, desiring to devote his time more especially
to biological investigation, resigned his position in the U. S. Coast
Survey and accepted the post of paleontologist for the Quaternary
invertebrates, offered by the Director of the U.S. Geological Survey.

180 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1834.

The national collection of Quaternary shells and their recent allies being
necessarily the source of identification of such fossils when newly col-
lected and their ultimate repository, with the permission of the Director
the curator.retained his honorary connection with the Museum, which
has lasted nearly twenty years. Work was immediately undertaken to
put the general collection in such order that the geologist desiring to
identify his fossils might do so with the least expenditure of time and
labor.

In view of the arrears of work to be made up this was no small under-
taking and the cenclusion of it by no means near at hand.

As the most immediate needs of the paleontologist are at this time
connected with the identification of the American land shells, that part
of the collection was first attacked, with the co-operation of Messrs.
Stearns and Call. It was placed in complete order, except so far as
depositing in cases is concerned, and as soon as the latter, now con-
structing, are in readiness the collection will be arranged in them ready
for examination and for use. The arrangement of the forms belonging
on our southern and southeastern coast, so long neglected and so im-
portant in connection with the later fossiliferous beds of our Southern
States, was undertaken by the curator himself, and a preliminary paper
by him on some recently acquired material from that region appeared
in the Proceedings of the Museum during the year. Incidentally it be-
came necessary to determine some of the well-known group of Cones,
and the entire collection belonging to that genus was carefully revised
and is now in condition for satisfactory reference.

The intimate connection between our deep-sea fauna and that of the Ter-
tiary beds of Southern Europe and the southern and western borders of
the United States is well known to geologists and naturalists. A good
deal of the leisure of the curator has been devoted to a study of the Gulf
and Caribbean deep-sea forms obtained by Prof. Alexander Agassiz
on the steamer Blake, a large number of which are already drawn for
the engraver, and a considerable amount of text has accumulated. This
fauna is intimately related to that of the formations of the isthmuses of
Panama and Nicaragua, which separate the two oceans. Were it pos-
sible to obtain fuller series of the rocks and fossils from that region, a
study of them would without doubt have an important bearing on the
projects for piercing the rocky barrier which now stands in the way of
commerce. The curator would recommend that, if it be possible, some
steps be taken to obtain such a collection, which from the excavations
now in progress at Panama would seem to be a work of no great diffi-
culty if a collector were once placed on the spot.

It is with great satisfaction that the curator is able to report that
heavy inroads have been made on the mass of material which has ac-
cumulated in the store-rooms of the Institution during the past ten years.
Much still remains, but a great deal has been examined, catalogued,
and assorted, partly for the reserve series and partly as duplicates for

ultimate distribution to other museums or for exchange. Case room is
the great need of the department at present, and it will continue for
some time to be the most urgent want which presents itself. —

Looking forward to the time when the collection shall be in working
order and various suites now promised or in course of transmission shall
have arrived, we may anticipate that in all that relates to North America
and its adjacent seas the national collection as a whole will not be sur-
passed, or even equaled, in the world.

For the North Atlantic and British seas the collection of Dr. Gwyn
Jeffreys is now in process of transmission.

For the northeastern coast of the United States the collections of the
U. 8. Fish Commission will eventually be deposited in the Museum.
For the North Pacific, Bering and Arctic Seas the collections of Messrs.
Dall, Turner, Fisher, Murdoch, the United States Revenue Marine, and
others are already in the Museum and partly administered upon.

For the western coast of North America, from Puget Sound to Panama,
the original Carpenter collection has long been a part of the Museum,
and the Stearns collection has been recently acquired.

The preceding series are without doubt the finest and most valuable
in existence relating to their respective regions, both in extent and
scientific value.

For the Gulf coast, Antilles, and southeastern shores of the United
States much material is on hand and more will doubtless be acquired
very soon. It is the weakest section of our American collection at pres-
ent, but may, with the eee of the Fish Commission corps, not
= remain so.

The land and fresh-water shells of the great interior region of the
United States are well represented, though much more remains to be
done before the collection in this regard can claim completeness. The
series of types contributed by Mr. W. G. Binney, Dr. Isaac Lea, Henry
Hemphill, and others, when administered upon and taken in connection
with the Centennial collection arranged by Dr. James Lewis, will form
a very satisfactory series, and the gaps which nevertheless exist may
probably be filled by proper effort as the deficiencies become evident in
arranging the material in hand.

In exotic material the collection consists chiefly of the contributions
of the various United States exploring expeditions, Hon. Nicholas Pike
and other friends of the Museum, and, while including many valuable
types, bears no comparison in fullness and value to the strictly Ameri-
can sections, as, indeed, might naturally be expected.

A list of the chief accessions to the Department of Mollusks during
the year is appended to this report. Though work of an administrative
nature has occupied nearly all the time of the curator and his assistants,
yet some contributions to original research have been made during the
year. The most important of these are the determination of the syste-
matic relations of Vurbinella pyrum Linné, long a desideratum, and the
182 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

investigation of Chlamydoconcha, a remarkable form of bivalve mollusk,
with an internal shell, from California, which proves to be the type of a
new family.

A list of the chief publications by the curator during 1884 is appended.

The number of entries made in the mollusk register during the past —

year is 5,231, but this is far from indicating the total number of acces-

sions, the majority of which have been laid aside to be catalogued later, —

as occasion Serves.

The total number of molluscan specimens in the possession of the #

Museum cannot be stated, as fully half of them are not catalogued; but
it is safe to estimate them at not less than four hundred thousand, in-
cluding duplicates and specimens in spirits. The number of species
may approximate twenty thousand, but this is much more uncertain.

Several years must elapse before a definite enumeration can be made.

The number of entries in the mollusk register is about forty-one thou-

sand, but this necessarily includes numerous duplications of the same

species from different localities. .

The following accessions have been made to the collection in this de-
partment during the year:

Adams, 8S. F., Lakeside, Beadle County, Dakota. Specimens of Planorbis
trivolvis, from Dakota.

Altogether the most valuable collection received during the year is
that made by Mr. Turner in Labrador. The material is quite exten-
Sive, especially in individuals, and has been collected and preserved
with great care and judgment. I have, therefore, taken great pains
to mount such of the alcoholic material and such of the dry material
as would most quickly deteriorate if left as collected, in order that it
may be permanently preserved for future study, and I have been par-
ticular to attach to every specimen, not only the accession number, but
the number used by the collector, so as to facilitate his own work upon
the collection.

The work of the department has consisted, in addition to the ordi-
nary correspondence and determination of material, in the proper care,
so far as time would permit, of the material received. But taking ad-
vantage of the Government’s participation in the New Orleans Exposi-
tion, Lhave prepared, as a part of the exhibit from the Department of
Agriculture, a collection illustrative of economic entomology, employ-

ing therefor drawers and cases made after the unit plan of the Museum.
Many of the specimens for this exhibit were furnished from my pri-
vate collection, and it has been prepared upon the understanding with
the proper authorities that it is, when returned to Washington, to form
part of the Museum collection.

In closing this brief report I cannot refrain from repeating the rec-
ommendations of previous years both as to the utilization of the
plates purchased of the late Prof. Townend Glover and as to the ne-
cessity of placing the department upon a secure financial basis.

Mr. Glover’s plates and notes on the Diptera, Orthoptera, Hemiptera,
and cotton insects have already been published, in very limited edition,
as “Manuscript Notes from my Journal.” Those of the remaining or-
ders comprise about 200 plates, which can be printed from by Mr. A. G.
Gedney, of this city (who formerly printed for Glover and has made
me his estimates), for $13.50 per 1,000 copies, quarto impressions. The
printing of an edition of 1,000 would, therefore, cost about $270, while
the printing of such text as would be necessary could probably be done
for about $500 additional.

Several valuable collections have, as during previous years, been
offered for sale at remarkably low rates, some of which I have pur-
chased individually and deposited with the pest of my collections. The
need of a salaried assistant is each year more obvious, not only for the
reasons stated in previous reports, but as a guarantee of the proper
future care, in case of my death or removal from the city, of the ento-
mological material already in the Museum, and as a further guarantee
to specialists that type collections, if donated, will have proper appre-
ciation and preservation.

BRATES* IN THE U. 8. NATIONAL MUSEUM FOR 1884,

By RICHARD RATHBUN, Curator.

ACCESSIONS.

The record of accessions to this department of the Museum during
the year just passed is unusually satisfactory. Several identified col-
lections of great value have been obtained from well-known European
and American authorities, and a large amount of material for future
elaboration has been received. The most important additions were
made, as usual, by the U. 8. Fish Commission, and represent the recent
deep-sea explorations of the steamer Albatross over a wide area. Large
collections were likewise obtained from other sources. The total num-
ber of accessions was 72, and the number of shipping packages of all
sizes received, 240. This enumeration does not, however, convey an
adequate conception of the extent of the additions to the department,
as several of the accessions amounted to more than 1,200 packages each,
if all the jars, bottles, vials, and small boxes are counted. The princi-

pal additions were as follows:
The U.S. Fish Commission: Very large and valuable collections were
transferred to this department by the Fish Commission in 1884. Cer-
tain portions of these collections having been worked up, and reports
upon them presented to the Commissioner, they now come into the per-
manent possession of the Museum, but other portions are to be regarded
as simply in its custody for safe-keeping. ;

Over 1,200 packages were received from the cruise of the steamer
Albatross in the Caribbean Sea and Gulf of Mexico and among the
West Indian Islands, from January to May, 1884; but this number does
not include many samples of bottom materials obtained at the sound-
ing stations in connection with the work of the Hydrographic Bureau,
and elsewhere credited to the Navy Department. This collection will
largely supplement the very valuable results recently obtained by the
Coast Survey steamer Blake in the same region. It contains many rep-
resentatives of all the principal groups of marine invertebrates common

* Exclusive of the Mollusca.
189
190 REPORT OF NATIONAL MUSEUM, 1884.

to that area, from the littoral zone to a depth of 1,700 fathoms, an
especial feature being a large and fine series of Crinoids (Pentacrinus)
from off Havana and elsewhere. Considering that during this cruise
the Albatross was mainly occupied with hydrographic work, the col-
lection does much credit to the energy and zeal of the officers and nat-
uralists attached to the vessel. The Crustacea have been sent to Prof.
8. I. Smith, at New Haven, Connnecticut, for study; the Anthozoa are to
be examined by Prof. A. E. Verrill; and the Ech have already been
worked up by the curator of the department. The Annelids, which are
not included in the above enumeration, were retained on board the
steamer, where they are being studied by Mr. James E. Benedict.

Fifty-six cases, including 1,400 packages, of specimens resulting from
the explorations of the steamers Albatross and Fish Hawk, during last
summer, off the eastern coast of the United States, between George’s
Bank and the latitude of Cape Hatteras, were sent direct from the
Wood’s Holl station to the Museum. The greater part of this material
had been examined and identified by the naturalists at Wood’s Holl,
but much of it is still undetermined. An additional collection made
by the steamer Albatross on her return trip from Wood’s Holl to Wash-
ington was received in November.

Eleven cases, containing nearly 800 packages, of alcoholic specimens,
and 171 species, have been received from Prof. A. E. Verrill. These
represent a portion of the results of Professor Verrill’s studies on the
Echinoderms and Anthozoa, and of those of Prof. S. I. Smith on the
Crustacea, made at New Haven during the year. The collection of
deep-sea barnacles stored at New Haven has also been turned over to
the Museum by Professor Smith, for transmission to Dr. P. P. C. Hoek,
of Leyden, a competent authority, who has offered to examine and
report upon this group.

Several smaller collections were sent in by or through the Fish Com-
mmission, as follows: Specimens of various kinds obtained at the mouth
of Saint Mary’s River, Florida, in March, by the steamer Fish Hawk ;
Crustaceans and Radiates collected by Dr. T. H. Bean at Fire Island
Beach and Patchogue, Long Island, during the summer; numerous
Crustaceans from Mr. E. G. Blackford, of New York; specimen of
Crustacean fish parasites from Vineyard Sound, Massachusetts, and
of rare Crustaceans obtained by the steam-dredger working about the
new pier of the Fish Commission at Wood’s Holl, from Mr. Vinal N.
Edwards.

The following donations from Gloucester fishermen were also re-
ceived through the Fish Commission: Specimens of sponges and corals
from the fishing grounds off the provincial coast; specimen of cup
sponge and several Bryozoan corals from the fishing grounds north of
Iceland, collected and donated by Capt. J. A. Dago, of the schooner
Concord ; a lobster from near Gloucester, Mass., of which one side is of
the normal color and the other red, or similar to the color produced by

REPORT OF DEPARTMENT OF MARINE INVERTEBRATES. 191

boiling. On this interesting specimen the two colors are equally dis-
tributed and meet along the median line of both the dorsal and ventral
surfaces. In no place does either color encroach upon the other, but
their line of demarkation is as distinctly marked as though the speci-
men had been colored by hand, although it is undoubtedly a genuine
freak of nature.

Dr. Edward Palmer: Sixty-five cases of Corals, Sponges, Crustaceans,
and Echinoderms from Southern Florida and the Dry Tortugas. This
is the largest collection, next to that of the Fish Commission, received
by this department during the year, and was made in the interest of
the New Orleans International Exposition, through the funds appro-
priated for that purpose by Congress. In detailing Dr. Palmer for this
undertaking, it was with the intention of bringing together as exhaust-
ive a collection as possible of the more important and conspicuous ani-
mal products of the coral-reef region of Southern Florida, which, con-
sidering its many interesting economic and biological features, has
never been properly represented hitherto, either in the National Museum
collections or in connection with any of our great expositions. The re-
sults obtained by Dr, Palmer were eminently satisfactory, although it
is impossible at so early a date to make anything like a complete report
upon his collection. Its value is greatly enhanced by the very full
notes which accompany it. It has been entirely unpacked, and all of
the specimens have been separately labeled, to insure their future iden-
tity beyond a possibility of error or confusion. The dried specimens of
small to medium size have been stored in unit trays (of which they fill
about 100), temporarily arranged in the west hall of the Smithsonian
Institution. The larger corals have been retained in their original
cases, from which the packing materials have been removed. The Ac-
tinian or stony corals comprise the bulk of the collection, although there
is a large representation of Gorgonian corals, and the number of finely
prepared sponges is very great. The Crustaceans and Echinoderms, of
which there are many specimens and species, are mainly preserved in
alcohol.
