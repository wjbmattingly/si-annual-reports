APPENDIX TO PROCEEDINGS OF REGENTS.

REPORT OF COMMITTEE ON THE TRANSFER OF THE REMAINS OF JAMES
SMITHSON TO THE UNITED STATES.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: As the committee charged with the duty of bringing
to the United States the mortal remains of James Smithson, the
founder of the Smithsonian Institution, I beg to report the successful
accomplishment of my mission; and the remains were handed over
to the Smithsonian Institution last Monday, the 25th of January,
1904.

I reached Genoa, Italy, on the 25th of December, 1903, and next
day presented my credentials to the American consul, Mr. Wilham
Henry Bishop, and to Mr. Noel Lees, for the committee of the
sritish Burial Ground Fund Association.

On the 29th of December I made formal application for the
remains of James Smithson, and on the 31st of December they were
delivered into my custody. In accordance with the expressed wish
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XXTI

of the Regents, the exhumation was effected quietly and privately,
only the American consul and six other witnesses being present in
addition to the workmen employed.

I have the honor of submitting the following certificate from the
American consul describing the exhumation:

THE CONSULATE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,
Genoa, Italy.
‘To whom it may concern :

I, William Henry Bishop, consul of the United States of America, do hereby
certify that on Thursday, December 31, 1903, at about 11 o’cloeck in the morn-
ing, I was present at the opening of the grave known without doubt or question
to be that of James Smithson, in the old English cemetery of San Benigno at
Genoa, said James Smithson having died at Genon in the year 1829, and having
been buried till now in the said cemetery. That on the opening of the grave
the remains, consisting of little more than the skeleton, were seen clearly
exposed to view, since no earth had been thrown upon the body, and the wooden
coffin that contained it had entirely fallen to decay; that said remains were
reverently removed from the grave and placed in a metal casket prepared to
receive them; that the said metal casket was thereupon sealed up securely
and put in the mortuary chapel of the cemetery, as in the custody of Dr. Alex-
ander Graham Bell, to await his conyenience in conveying it to America,

I further certify that there were present with me, and witnesses of all the
circumstances of the above-described exhumation, the following persons: Dr.
Alexander Graham Bell, Washington, D. C., especially commissioned by the
Smithsonian Institution to convey the remains of James Smithson to the United
States; Mrs..Alexander Graham Bell, his wife, Washington, D. C.: Noel Lees,
esq., Genoa, Italy, official representative of the British Burial Ground Fund
Association, in which the proprietorship of the said cemetery of San Benigno
is vested; Gino Coppede, Genoa, architect and engineer, Charged with the work
of opening the tomb and grave of the said James Smithson, and of removing
all the belongings of the said cemetery to the new site to which it is to be
transferred ; Giovanni Battista Firpo, Genoa, gardener by profession and paid
custodian for many years past of the said cemetery and of the grave of James
Smithson, having succeeded his father in the same office; Federico Guarini,
the municipal guard deputed by the bureau of hygiene to be present on the ocea-
sion; Paolo Parodi, metal worker and chief undertaker, in transferring the
remains to the casket and soldering up the same.

That the above-mentioned persons are all personally known to me, and known
to fill the various functions respectively assigned to them above. That they
have consented to be sworn as to the matters herein alleged, and that each has
appended his signature hereunto as making oath to the truth of the statements,
so far as each one individually is concerned, above set forth.

[ SEAL. ] WILLIAM HENRY BrIsHop,

Consul of the United States of America at Genoa, Italy.
XXIT PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS,

The above certificate of the American consul was signed by the
witnesses named in the mortuary chapel of the cemetery after the
casket had been soldered up in their presence. The witnesses named
and the workmen employed then stood around with uncovered heads
while the consul of the United States placed over the remains of
James Smithson the American flag.

The casket was left in the mortuary chapel to await my convenience
in transporting it to America; and Giovanni Battista Firpo, the
gardener employed by the Smithsonian Institution as the custodian
of the grave of James Smithson, was left in charge—he agreeing to
remain in the mortuary chapel night and day until the removal of the
remains.

On Saturday, the 2d of January, 1904, the foregoing witnesses
again assembled in the mortuary chapel of the cemetery, and in their
presence the metallic casket was placed within a coffin of strong wood.

Before the lid of the coffin was screwed down our consul, Mr.
Bishop, placed upon the casket the seal of the consulate of the United
States and covered the casket with an American flag. Mrs. Bell then
placed within the coffin a wreath of leaves from the grave of Smith-
son, and all the witnesses contributed flowers.

Immediately before the removal of the remains from the mortuary
chapel the following addresses were made:

REMARKS OF WILLIAM HENRY BISHOP, UNITED STATES CONSUL.

[On the occasion of the removal of the remains of James Smithson from the mortuary
chapel of the cemetery of San Benigno, January 2, 1904.]

Dr. ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL: You arrived here, my dear Dr. Graham Bell,
charged by the Smithsonian Institution with the mission of removing to Wash-
ington the remains of the founder of that Institution, James Smithson, who has
been buried till now in the cemetery where we stand, since his death at Genoa
in the year 1829. Having been invited by you and by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution to aid you to what extent I might be able in this object, it has been a
matter of great pride and pleasure to me that I have been allowed to do so.

All the steps necessary to such removal have now been taken. We have
received the authorization of the governmental heads of the province, the city,
and the British Burial Ground Fund, in which latter the title to the cemetery
and the custody of the grave of James Smithson is vested, and all of these have
kindly cooperated with us in the work.

The body of James Smithson has now been reverently raised from the earth:
it has been placed in a case securely sealed, and this case stands ready to pass
into the charge of the steamship company which will convey it to New York.

IT assure you that it is with a feeling of real emotion that I have just now
east the American flag over the body of this illustrious man, this noble but as
yet little known benefactor, as it is on the verge of beginning its journey to the
United States. The flag adopts him already, as it were, in the substance, for
our country, to which he has so long belonged in the spirit. He is now about
to receive there a portion of the outward veneration and homage he so supremely
merits, and which, owing to the modest circumstances of his life, and his inter-
ment here in some sense almost forgotten, he has neyer had.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XXITI

Shal! I admit that on taking possession. of my post as consul at Genoa, I
did not even know who James Smithson was? I may say that I was surprised
to learn that he was buried at Genoa; more surprised still that he was an
Englishman, whe had never even set foot in America. He left his great bequest
to the United States, then in its infancy, through admiring confidence in our
future. It is likely that many, or even most, Americans are in the same condi-
tion as was I myself; for occasion has rarely arisen for taking thought as to
the personality of the man. Happily this unenlightened condition of mind is
about to cease.

Dr. Graham Bell, I wish you a hearty godspeed across the ocean with your
precious freight. The American people will receive it with general gratification,
and, through the Smithsonian Institution, will soon delight to pay it great honor,

REMARKS OF ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL IN RESPONSE TO THE ABOVE.

Mr. Consu.: It is with feelings of deep emotion that I undertake the trans-
portation of the remains of James Smithson from the cemetery where they have
so long reposed to their Jast resting place in the United States.

On behalf of the Smithsonian Institution allow me to thank you, Mr. Consul,
for the unwearied zeal and care with which you have given me your assistance.
Without your active cooperation and without your personal sympathy it would
have been difficult indeed for me to have accomplished the object of nvy mission
here.

On behalf of the Smithsonian Institution, I beg to thank you, too, Mr. Noel
Lees, for your courtesy and attention; and trust that you will convey to His
$ritish Majesty’s consul-general and to the committee of the British Church
Burial Ground Fund my thanks and the thanks of the Institution I represent
for their ready assistance in furthering my mission.

The United States of America will provide in Washington, D. C., a suitable
and permanent resting place for the remains of her great benefactor, James
Smithson, through the instrumentality of the Smithsonian Institution—the
establishment created by the Government to perpetuate his name.

REMARKS OF NOEL LEES, ESQ.
[On behalf of the British Burial Ground Fund Committee. ]

Dr. GRAHAM BELL: I beg to thank you heartily for the words you have said
with regard to the aid you have received from the burial board and myself.
Although we regret to lese the remains of James Smithson, we at the same
time feel that in the country to which he left his money, with such charitable
intent, his remains will receive the honor and glory which have so long been
due to them, and we must understand that our loss is America’s gain. To us
it will always remain a pleasant memory that, from the date of his burial
to the present day, we have had in our custody in this picturesque little
churchyard the remains of a man whose foresight and kindness haye enabled
so many in the New World to benefit.

Upon the conclusion of these remarks the remains of James Smith-
son were transported to the North German Lloyd steamship Princess
Trene, accompanied by the American consul and myself. The steamer
left Genoa for New York on the 7th of January, 1904, touching at
Naples and Gibraltar on the way. The American consul at Naples,
General Byington, contributed an American flag to cover the wooden
coffin containing the remains.

being made in the United States, I telegraphed from Gibraltar to my
son-in-law, Mr. Gilbert H. Grosvenor, expressing the hope that the
remains of James Smithson would be received with as much honor as
those of John Howard Payne.

After conferring with the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, Mr. Grosvenor laid the substance of my telegram before the
President of the United States, who immediately responded by
requesting the Secretary of the Navy to detail the U. S. dispateh-
boat Dolphin to meet the Princess Irene on her arrival at quarantine,
escort her to the pier at Hoboken, N. J., and then bring the remains
to Washington.

At the request of Mr. Grosvenor a squadron of United States cav-
alry was also detailed to escort the remains from the navy-yard to
their resting place here. Mr. Grosvenor has made a report to me of
the correspondence which resulted in this cooperation of the United
States Government, which will be found in the appendix.

As your committee charged with the duty of bringing the remains
to the Smithsonian Institution, I have expressed to the President
and to the Secretary of the Navy and to the Secretary of War my
sincere appreciation of these acts of courtesy, which have given a
national character to the reception accorded to the remains of James
Smithson on their arrival in the United States.

On Monday, the 25th of January, 1904, I handed over, at the
Smithsonian Institution, to Senator Frye, as the representative of
the Board of Regents, the remains of this great benefactor of the
United States.

I have the honor to present as an appendix to this report the fol-
lowing documents:

A. Copy of the application of your committee to the committee of the British
Burial Ground Fund Association for the custody of the remains of James Smith-
son, with the reply.

B. Copy of the application of your committee to the prefect of the province of
Genoa for permission to remove the remains of James Smithson to the United
States, with a copy of the decree permitting such remoyal.

C. Copy of a certificate made by the British consul-general at Genoa, at the
request of the municipal bureau of hygiene, stating that no objection existed on
the part of the British consulate-general to the removal of the remains of James
Smithson. :

D. Certificate of the acting mayor of Genoa that all the requirements of the
existing regulations on mortuary matters had been complied with.

E. Copy of the final certificate of the American consul, given to your comuinit-
tee on board the steamer Princess Irene as she was about to leave Genoa for

F. Copy of letter from Lieut. Commander J. H. Gibbons, U. S. Navy, deliv-
ered on board the steamer Princess Irene wpon her arrival at quanantine,

G. Copy of the remarks of your committee at the Smithsonian Institution
January 25, 1904, in handing over the remains of James Smithson to Senator
Frye as the representative of the Board of Regents, together with the reply of
Senator Frye.

H. Copy of report of Mr. Gilbert H. Grosvenor, M. A., concerning the corre-
spondence which resulted in the cooperation of the United States Government
in transporting the remains of James Smithson from NewYork to the Smith-
sonian Institution in Washington, D. C.

I. Copy of telegrams and letters sent by your committee to the President of
the United States, and to the Secretary of the Navy, and to the Secretary of
War, in acknowledgment of Government courtesies.

J. Statement of expenses incurred in the remoyal of the remains of James
Smithson to the United States.

,

I may say that it is entirely due to the ability and energy of our
consul at Genoa that the transfer of the remains to the United States
was effected at all. Without his earnest and intelligent assistance it
would have been difficult indeed, if not impossible, for me to have
accomplished the object of my mission abroad. No less than five dis-
tinct permits had to be obtained from different government officials
in Italy, besides a certificate from the British consul-general and per-
mission from the British Burial Ground Fund Association. In addi-
tion to the official permits required special difficulties were encoun-
tered which at first sight seemed insurmountable, but which were
successfully overcome by the tact and ability of our consul at Genoa.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX A.—Application to the committee of the British Burial Ground Fund
Association for the custody of the remains of James Smithson, with the
reply.

EDEN PALACE HOTEL,
Genoa, December 29, 1908.

Dear Sire: I have the honor to request that the remains of James Smithson,
now resting in the old cemetery on the heights of San Benigno, be delivered to
me for transportation to the United States.

By the will of James Smithson the United States of America became his heir.
The Government of the United States accepted the bequest ; and, in conformity
with the terms of the will created in Washington, D. C., an establishment for the
increase and diffusion of knowledge among men under the title of “ The Smith-
sonian Institution.”

It appears that an immediate necessity exists for the removal of the remains
of this great benefactor of the United States from the cemetery where they have
so long reposed; and it seems peculiarly appropriate that the body of Smithson

should now be taken to America and cared for permanently by the institution
which bears his name.
As the authorized representative of the Smithsonian Institution for this
purpose, I respectfully make application for the custody of the remains.

Sm: 1. IT have the honor to inform you that the Navy Department has ordered
the Dolphin to escort the Princess Trene to her pier at Hoboken, after which she

2. The commandant of the navy-yard, New York, will send a tug alongside
the Princess Irene after she arrives at her pier, and has made the necessary
arrangements with the health and custom authorities so that there will be no
delay in transferring the remains to the Dolphin. ;

3. The Dolphin will anchor off the Battery and remain there until early day-
light of the next day after the remains have been received on board, when she
will sail for Washington, D. C. In case you wish to accompany the remains to
Washington I am authorized to offer vou a passage on the Dolphin. It was the
intention of the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution, Professor Langley, to

APPENDIX G.—LRemarks of Alerander Graham Bell at the Smithsonian Insti-
tution January 25, 1904, in handing over the remains of James Smithsov
to Senator Frye as the representative of the Board of Regents, together with
the reply of Senator Frye.

REMARKS OF A. G. BELL.

Mr. Senator: I have the honor of handing over to the Smithsonian Insti-
tution the mortal remains of its founder, James Smithson, fellow of the Royal
Society of London, England, who died in Genoa, Italy, on the 26th of June, 1829.
PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XXIX

For nearly seventy-five years the body of Smithson has lain in an almost
forgotten grave in the picturesque little British cemetery on the heights of San
Benigno, in Genoa. City improvements have now rendered necessary the expro-
priation of the cemetery and the removal of the remains; and at the last meet-
ing of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution | was appointed a
committee to arrange for the transfer of the body of Smithson to the United
States.

Upon my arrival in Genoa I was afforded every possible facility for the
accomplishment of my mission by the provincial and municipal authorities, by
His British Majesty’s consul-general (Mr. Keene), and by the committee of the
British Burial Ground Fund Association, in which is vested the ownership of
the cemetery, as well as by our own consul, Mr. William Henry Bishop, to
whom I am indebted for invaluable assistance.

On the 51st of December, 1905, the tomb of Smithson was opened in my
presence as the representative of the Smithsonian Institution, and in the
presence of the American consul, Mr. Bishop, and six other witnesses. The
remains of James Smithson were reverently raised from the grave and placed
in a metallic casket, over which the consul of the United States cast the Ameri-
ean flag, while the witnesses stood around with uncovered hends.

The casket was left in the mortuary chapel of the cemetery—securely sealed
and under guard—until the 2d day of January, 1904, when it was placed in a
coffin of strong wood, as required by Italian law, and was then removed to the
North German Lloyd steamship Princess Irene, accompanied by the American
consul and myself.

The steamer left Genoa on the 7th of January; and upon arrival in the
United States the remains of James Smithson were received with national
honors by direction of the President and of the Secretary of the Navy and the
Secretary of War.

The remains were transported to Washington on the U. S. dispatch boat
Dolphin, and have been escorted to the Smithsonian Institution by United
States cavalry.

And now, Mr. Senator, my mission is ended, and I deliver into your hands, as
the representatiye of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, the
remains of this great benefactor of the United States.

REMARKS OF SENATOR FRYE.

Stir: The Smithsonian Institution receives with profound gratitude the
remains of its distinguished founder. Providence, every now and then, seems
to place in the world a man and inspires him with a purpose to elevate his
fellow-men. Such a man was Mr. Smithson, the founder of this Institution.
The spirit, sir, which prompted you to such earnest endeavor, resulting as it
did in taking these remains from their resting place in a country foreign to
him and foreign to us, and bringing them here, where for so many years we
have enjoyed the rich fruits of his splendid benefaction, your countrymen will
appreciate. His grave here will be an incentive to earnest, faithful, wise, and
discreet endeavor to carry out his lofty purposes, and, sir, it will be to our
people a sacred spot while the Republic endures.

APPENDIX H.—Report of Mr. Gilbert H. Grosvenor, M. A., concerning the cor-
respondence which resulted in the cooperation of the United States Govern-
ment in transporting the remains of James Smithson from New York to the
Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C.

Hursarp Mremortart Harn,
Washington, D. C., January 23, 1904.

Deak Mr. Bett: I beg to submit the following report on arrangements for
the reception of James Smithson. On January 7 I received the following cable-
grant from you:

“ GENOA, January 7, 1904.
** GILBERT GROSVENOR,
“Memorial Building, Sixteenth and M, Washington, D. C.

“We bring Smithson’s remains steamship Princess Irene, touching Naples
and Gibraltar. See Henderson, Hitt, Langley about formalities of landing and
transfer to Washington.

* GRAHAM BELtL.’”’
XXX PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

I thereupon consulted with Mr. Langley who assured me that all formalities
were being arranged so that the remains might be admitted into this country
without delay. On Sunday, January 10, I cabled to you at Gibraltar as
tollows:

* BELL, Princess Irene, Gibraltar.
“ Congratulations. Formalities arranged.
* GILBERT GROSVENOR.”

On Monday, January 11, I received the following cablegram from you:

* GIBRALTAR, January 11, 1904.
* GILBERT GROSVENOR, Washington. D. C.

“Hope Smithson’s remains will be received with as much honor as those of
John Howard Payne. Notify me at quarantine what to expect.
“GRAHAM BELL.”

Upon receipt of this message I called upon Dr. S. P. Langley and expressed
your desire that suitable honors be rendered James Smithson upon the arrival
of the remains in this country. I then addressed the following letter to the
President of the United States, Hon. Theodore Rooseyelt :

“ Hubsarp MEMorIAL HALL,
“Washington, D. C., January 11, 1904.

“Str: The remains of James Smithson, the founder of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, are now being brought to the United States by Dr. Alexander Graham
Sell, one of the Regents of the Institution. The remains left Gibraltar this
morning on the steamer Princess Irene, and are due in New York about the 20th
instant. Dr. Graham Bell has cabled me urging that the remains be received
with as much honor as those of John Howard Payne. It would seem most
appropriate that a Government vessel, a ship of war, a revenue cutter, or even
a tug, be detailed to meet the Princess Irene when she enters the harbor of New
York and receive Smithson’s remains. This official tribute from the American
nation seems due a man who bequeathed his entire fortune to a people whom he
had never seen. As the time is urgent I take the liberty of addressing you
directly, rather than through oflicial channels. I would respectfully: beg, in
case your honor does not deem it fitting to order detailed a vessel to welcome
Smithson in the harbor of New York, that I be so informed at once, in order
that private plans for paying honor to this illustrious benefactor may then be
carried out.

“T beg to remain, most respectfully,
“ GILBERT H. GROSVENOR.

* Hon. THEODORE ROOSEVELT,

* President of the United States.”

On Tuesday, January 12, I received word from the Secretary of the Navy that
my request for a war ship had been approved by the President, and I was asked
to send a formal application for the detail of the Dolphin. I thereupon for-
warded the following application :

“ JANUARY 12, 1904.

“Str: Pursuant to the request from the Secretary of the Navy, I beg herewith
formally and respectfully to petition that the Dolphin be detailed to receive the
remains of James Smithson, the founder of the Smithsonian Institution, in New
York Harbor and convey them to Washington. 1 beg to remain,

“ Most respectfully,
“ GILBERT H. GROSVENOR.

“ Hon. THEODORE ROOSEVELT,

“President of the United States, Washington.”

The Dolphin was thereupon detailed and ordered to New York.

On January 18 I called upon the Chief of Staff, Lieut. Gen. Adna R. Chaffee,
and requested a military escort to receive the remains of James Smithson when
they reached this city, and on January 19 forwarded the following formal
application :

“ JANUARY 18, 1904.

“Sir: The remains of James Smithson, the founder of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, will reach Washington on Friday or Saturday of this week. The remains

are to be brought from New Yori on the Dolphin, which was especially det: iiled
-by the Secretary of the Navy to proceed to New York. receive them from the
Princess Irene, when the latter ship arrived from Genoa, and bring them to
Washington. When the Dolphin reaches this city the remains will be conveyed
without ceremony to Oak Hill Cemetery, where they will be deposited until
action is taken as to their final disposition. It would seem most appropriate
that an escort of 50 or 100 cavalrymen be detailed to accompany the remains
from the dock to the cemetery. I have the honor to respectfully request,
therefore, that an escort be detailed for this purpose. For your information I
beg to inclose a copy of the letter addressed to the President, which was
approved by him and led to the detail of the Dolphin.
“Very respectfully,
“GILBERT TH. GROSVENOR.
“Tieut. Gen. ADNA R. CHAFFEE, U. S. Army.
; “War Department, Washington, D.C.”

On January 20 the following letter was received from General Chaffee, stat-
ing that the military escort ‘had been detailed :
“ JANUARY 19, 1904.
“Sie: I have just received your note of January 19, requesting an escort of
cavalry for the remains of Mr. James Smithson, the founder of the Smith-
soninn Institution, which are to arrive, as you say, on Friday or Saturday of
this week on the Dolphin. I have instructed the commanding officer of Fort
Myer to hold in readiness an escort of 50 men, properly officered, and an
artillery caisson to convey the remains. In order to give further direction in
this matter to avoid delay and to insure promptness, it will be necessary for
you to advise me of the time and place the escort should be directed to report
to receive the remains. Will you please make certain that I am informed of
this matter at least twelve hours in advance?

MEETINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS,

At a meeting of the Board of Regents held March 12, 1903, the fol-

lowing resolution was adopted:

Resolved, That in addition to the prescribed meeting held on the
fourth Wednesday in January, regular meetings of the Board shall be
held on the Tuesday after the first Monday in December and on the
6th day of March, unless that d: ate f falls on Sunday, when the follow-
ing Monday shall be substituted.”
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 3

In accordance with the above resolution the Board met on Decem-
ber 8, 1903, January 27, 1904, and March 7, 1904.

The following is an abstract of its proceedings, which latter will be
found in the annual report of the Board to Congress:

Regular meeting of December 8, 1903.

Senator Platt and the Chancellor made statements with regard to the
new building for the National Museum, and the Secretary read a report
which showed that with the advice and consent of the Chancellor and
the chairman of the executive committee, as required by the resolution
of the Board adopted March 12, 1903, a contract had been made, under
date of May 18, 1903, with Mca Hornblower & Marshall, are hitects,
of Washington, D. C., for the necessary architectural services.

With regard to the special report of the executive committee as sub-
mitted by Doctor Bell, and the report of the special committee which was
read at length by the Chancellor, the Board, after discussion, adopted
resolutions providing for the printing of these reports and their dis-
tribution to the members of the Board.

The Secretary presented the compilation of laws which had heen
prepared in accordance with a resolution offered by Senator Cockrell
at the meeting of March 12, 1903, and the manuscript was referred to
Senator Cockrell for his examination and decision as to printing.

The Secretary read letters from the Hon. William Henry Bishop,
United States consul at Genoa, Italy, and from the committee of the
British burial ground fund, explaining the urgency of action with
regard to the remoyal of the remains of James Smithson.

Doctor Bell renewed the proposition which he made at the last
meeting that the remains of Smithson be brought to this country
at his expense, and after discussion the Board adopted the following
resolutions:

“Resolved, That Dr. A. Graham Bell be appointed as a committee
to take charge of the matter of the removal of the remains of James
Smithson from Genoa to Washington, with the request that the nego-
tiations and removal be conducted quietly and privately.

“* Resolved, That. upon the conclusion of this duty all expenses in-

volved by it be reimbursed to Doctor Bell from’ the funds of the
ieetations?

ANNUAL MEETING OF JANUARY 27, 1904.

The Secretary announced that on January 12 the Speaker of the
House had reappointed Representatives Hitt, Adams, and Dinsmore as
Regents for two years; and also that Senator Henderson and Dr. A.
Graham Bell had been reappointed for a term of six years by joint
resolution approved by the President January 27, 1904.

The usual resolution relative to income and expenditure was adopted,
and the Secretary presented his annual report of the operations of the
4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Institution and its several dependencies for the fiscal year ending June
30, 1908.

The Board adopted the annual report of the executive committee to
the same date, showing in detail the financial condition of the Institu-
tion.

Senator Henderson, chairman of the permanent committee, made
statements in regard to the proposed bequests of Addison T. Reid and
Joseph White Sprague; also concerning the will of Wallace C. Andrews,
and the present status of the Hodgkins and Avery funds. He further
reported upon the expenditures incurred by the Secretary since the
last annual meeting, in continuing his experiments in mechanical
flight under the authority of the Board.

The Secretary made a statement concerning the publications in
preparation by the Institution and also with regard to aerodromic
experiments carried on by him.

He reported that Congress, under a clause of the sundry civil act,
approved March 8, 1903, had authorized the erection of a new build-
ing for the National Museum at a cost not to exceed $3,500,000.

He spoke of the work of the Bureau of American Ethnology and of
his efforts to place the Bureau upon a sound administrative footing.
He recalled previous efforts to secure a law for the protection of
antiquities on the public domain, and urged present action. The
Board thereupon adopted a resolution to that effect.

The Secretary reported upon the work of the International
Exchanges, the National Zoological Park, and the Astrophysical
Observatory.

The report of the special committee to consider the question of
defining the duties of the executive committee was submitted by the
Chancellor, but action thereupon was deferred until the meeting of
March 7.

At the evening session of this meeting Dr. A. Graham Bell sub-
mitted in full his report upon the removal of James Smithson’s
remains from Genoa to Washington, which is on file with the records
of the Board and a lengthy abstract of which will be found on page 7.

After remarks, the Board adopted the following resolutions:

‘© Resolved, That the Board of Regents desire to record in the min-
utes of the Institution their profound appreciation of the voluntary
service of Dr. Alexander Graham Bell in personally going to Genoa
and returning with the remains of James Smithson that they might
find a resting place in the grounds of the Institution he so nobly
founded ‘for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men.’

** Resolved, That the Chanceilor and the Secretary, with the members
of the executive committee, be appointed a committee upon the ques-
tion of the final disposition of the remains of James Smithson and of

the monument to be erected to him, with power to act in the entire
matter,”
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. i)
REGULAR MEETING OF MARCH 7, 1904.

The Chancellor read in full the report of the special committee
appointed to consider the question of defining the powers of the
executive committee, which was very fully discussed and adopted.

Doctor Bell then read the special report of the executive committee
as presented by him at the meeting of December 8, 1903. After dis-
cussion the Board adopted Senator Cullom’s motion that action on the
report be indefinitely postponed.

The report of the special committee on the disposition of the remains
of James Smithson, in which it was recommended that a fitting tomb
should be erected in the grounds of the Institution and that Congress
be requested to make an adequate appropriation for it, was submitted.
After remarks the report was adopted with the understanding that the
committee was to pursue the subject still further.

The Secretary brought before the Board the matter of the will of
the late Harriet Lane Johnston, who left a number of paintings to the
Corcoran Gallery of Art until a national gallery of art should be estab-
lished by the Government. The Corcoran Gallery had declined the
pictures under these conditions, and the Secretary had been addressed
with regard to the probability of the Government establishing such
a gallery of art under the Smithsonian Institution. The matter was
referred to the executive committee.

GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

The Institution has been for more than half a century one of the
most important agencies in the intellectual life of the American people.
It has furnished a center for workers in every department of scientific
and educational activity, and it has been the chief agency for the free
exchange of books, apparatus of research, and of scientific intelligence
between this and other countries. Its publications, which include
more than 250 volumes, are to be found in all of the important libraries
of the world, and some of them on the work table of every scientific
investigator. Its library constitutes an important part of the Library
of Congress, and its museum is the rarest in existence in many branches
of the natural history and ethnology of the New World.

For nearly sixty years it has been in constant cooperation with the
Government, with public institutions, and with individuals in every
enterprise, scientific or educational, which needed its advice, support,
oraid. The appreciation of the work of the Institution by the Ameri-
can people is best testified by their representatives in Congress. This
has been clearly demonstrated through many successive terms regard-
less of political change; by the judgment with which their representa-
tives upon the Board of Regents are selected; by the care by which
they protect the Institution in its freedom from political entangle-
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ments; by the discrimination with which.the reports are distributed,
and by numerous evidences of interest and liberality.

The objects of the Institution were defined by the founder in the
broadest possible terms, and interpreted by its first Secretary, Joseph
Henry, in the words *‘‘to assist men of science in making original
researches, to publish them in a series of volumes, and to give a copy
of them to every first-class library on the face of the earth.” While
the field has been of necessity narrowed from time to time, or diverted
in first one direction and then another, the breadth of scope has never
been narrowed. That many of the efforts have grown so large as to
require either direct support of the Government by the establishment
of independent bureaus, finally coming under the direction of the
Executive Departments, or aid to agencies which continue under the
direction of the Institution, though sustained by Congressional appro-
priation, is but a further evidence of the fact that the charter of the
Institution has been adhered to both in the spirit and in the letter.
The United States Weather Bureau, the Geological Survey, the Fish
Commission, and the National Herbarium grew out of its earlier activi
ties, and the National Museum, the International Exchanges, the
Bureau of American Ethnology, the Zoological Park, and the Astro-
physical Observatory are still directed by it. It led the way in the
organization of library work in the United States; it took the initial
steps and continues to support schemes for international cataloguing,
and it maintains a benevolent relation with the American Historical
Association and the National Society of the Daughters of the Ameri-
can Revolution.

Sixty years ago it was relatively the best endowed scientific institu-
tion in the United States and one of two or three of national scope.
The magnificent endowments in this time of so many universities and
colleges have changed this relationship to one of pecuniary inferiority,
yet without changing the nature of the Institution’s relations to these.
To the organizations aiding in the scientific advancement of the
country, which advancement has in large measure contributed to the
material welfare of the United States, the interests benefited thereby
have in return made large endowments for original research either
through the great universities and societies of the land or by the
establishment of new academies, institutions, and museums. To all
of these the Smithsonian Institution holds out a friendly cooperation,
its aim being, while continuing its own work upon its accepted lines
and adapting them to new needs as occasion arises, to continue along
the established policy of preventing rivalries, promoting wise cooper-
ation, diminishing waste, and furthering the search for knowledge,
the recording of discovered truth, and its dissemination among the
people.

It must at no time be forgotten, however, that the Institution, of
which the Government is trustee, was not limited either by the founder
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. f

or by Congress to the people of the United States, but was designed
for all men. © The spreading abroad of the work done by scientific men
in this country, the bringing to the knowledge of our own workers
the researches of men of other lands, the aiding in international con-
eresses which take place from time to time in various countries, the
promotion, in short, of friendly relations and useful cooperation
among scientific men the world oyer, and the advice and support to
our Government in such relations wherever possible, may be counted
in no small measure among the important works which the Institution
is carrying on.

THE REMOVAL OF THE REMAINS OF JAMES SMITHSON.

The remains of James Smithson, founder of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, who died June 27, 1829, at Genoa, Italy, were deposited in the
little cemetery belonging to the English church, on the heights of San
Benigno, a solitary spot planted with cypress trees, and looking down
upon the Gulf of Genoa. In 1891 the Secretary of the Institution
visited the grave, and, with the approval of the regents, deposited with
the secretary of the English church fund a small sum to invest in Italian
5 per cent rents, for its perpetual care. It was visited on two later
occasions by the Secretary, who placed a bronze tablet containing a
bas-relief of Smithson, in the English church, and one also at the
tomb, whence it was subsequently stolen.

In previous reports mention has been made of the suggested removal
of the remains of Mr. Smithson to America, in view of the probability
that before many years the site of the cemetery might be required by
the Italian authorities. In accordance with the resolution of the
Regents adopted December 8, 1903 (see p. 3), appointing him a com-
mittee to take charge of the removal of the the remains from Genoa
to Washington, Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, accompanied by Mrs.
Bell, sailed on the 15th of December for the port of Cherbourg in
France, and going thence to Genoa, commenced at once the arrange-
ments for the transfer of the remains, arrangements which would have
occupied a quite indefinite time and incurred a corresponding delay
except for the aid given by the United States consul, Mr, William
Henry Bishop, which Dr. Bell gladly acknowledges.

On opening the tomb in the presence of Dr. Bell, the United States
consul, Noel Lees, esq. (official representative of the British Burial
Ground Fund Association), and other witnesses, it was found that the
remains of Smithson, represented by the skeleton, were in fair preser-
ration, although the wooden coffin in which they had been inclosed
had molded away. The remains were placed in a metal casket and
deposited in the mortuary chapel of the cemetery, where they vested
until January 2, when the casket was inclosed in a coffin of strong

“

wood and covered with the American flag by Consul Bishop. On this
8 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

oceasion Doctor Bell, Mr. Bishop, and the other witnesses again
assembled and the following remarks were made:

REMARKS BY WILLIAM HENRY BISHOP, ESQ., UNITED STATES CONSUL.

Dr. ALEXANDER GRAHAM Bei: You arrived, here, my dear Dr. Graham Bell,
charged by the Smithsonian Institution with the mission of removing to Washington
the remains of the founder of that Institution, James Smithson, who has been buried
till now in the cemetery where we stand since his death at Genoa in the year 1829.
Having been invited by you and by the Smithsonian Institution to aid you, to what
extent I might be able, in this object, it has been a matter of great pride and pleas-
ure to me that I have been allowed to do so.

All the steps necessary to such removal have now been taken. We have received
the authorization of the governmental heads of the province, the city, and the British
Burial Ground Fund, in which latter the title to the cemetery and the custody of the
grave of James Smithson are vested, and all of these have kindly cooperated with us
in the work.

The body of James Smithson has now been reverently raised from the earth; it
has been placed in a case securely sealed, and this case stands ready to pass into the
charge of the steamship company which will convey it to New York.

I assure you that it is with a feeling of real emotion that I have just now cast the
American flag over the body of this illustrious man, this noble but as yet little
known benefactor, as it is on the verge of beginning its journey to the United States.
The flag adopts him already, as it were, in the substance, for our country, to which
he has so long belonged in the spirit. He is now about to receive there a portion of
the outward veneration and homage he so supremely merits, and which, owing to
the modest circumstances of his life, and his interment here in some sense almost
forgotten, he has never had.

Shall I admit that on taking possession of my post as consul at Genoa I did not
even know who James Smithson was? I may say that I was surprised to learn that
he was buried at Genoa; more surprised still that he was an Englishman, who had
never even set foot in America. He left his great bequest to the United States, then
in its infancy, through admiring confidence in our future. It is likely that many, or
even most, Americans are in the same condition as was I myself; for occasion has
rarely arisen for taking thought as to the personality of the man. Happily this unen-
lightened condition of mind is about to cease.

Dr. Graham Bell, I wish you a hearty God-speed across the ocean with your
precious freight. The American people will receive it with general gratification,
and, through the Smithsonian Institution, will soon delight to pay it great honor.

RESPONSE BY DR. ALEXANDER GRAHAM BELL.

Mr. Consvt: It is with feelings of deep emotion that I undertake the transporta-
tion of the remains of James Smithson from the cemetery where they have so long
reposed to their last resting place in the United States.

On behalf of the Smithsonian Institution allow me to thank you, Mr. Consul, for
the unwearied zeal and care with which you have given me your assistance. With-
out your active cooperation and without your personal sympathy it would have been
difficult, indeed, for me to have accomplished the object of my mission here.

On behalf of the Smithsonian Institution I beg to thank you, too, Mr. Noel Lees,
for your courtesy and attention, and trust that you will convey to His British
Majesty’s consul-general and to the committee of the British Burial Ground Fund
my thanks, and the thanks of the Institution I represent, for their ready assistance
in furthering my mission.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9g

The United States of America will provide, in Washington, D. C., a suitable and
permanent resting place for the remains of her great benefactor, James Smithson,
through the instrumentality of the Smithsonian Institution, the establishment
created by the Government to perpetuate his name.

RBMARKS BY NOEL LEES, ESQ.

Dr. Granam Bexw: I beg to thank you heartily for the words you have said with
regard to the aid you have received from the burial board and myself. Although
we regret to lose the remains of James Smithson, we at the same time feel that in the
country to which he left his money, with such charitable intent, his remains will
receive the honor and glory which have so long been due to them, and we must
understand that our loss is America’s gain. To us it will always remain a pleasant
memory that, from the date of his burial to the present day, we have had in our cus-
tody in this picturesque little churchyard, the remains of a man whose foresight and
kindness have enabled so many in the New World to benefit.
On the conclusion of these remarks the remains were placed on

board the steamer Princess Irene, of the North German Lloyd Com-
pany, which brought them to America in the personal charge of Dr.
Bell, the vessel reaching New York on the morning of January 20,
By direction of the President of the United States, the U. S. S. Dol-
phin met the Princess [rene in the lower bay and escorted her up the
harbor.

In the presence of Dx. Bell and the Secretary of the Institution, the
remains were transferred to a naval tug and conveyed to the Dolphin,
and in the continued charge of Dr. Bell were brought to Washington,
arriving at the Navy-Yard on Saturday, January 23.

On Monday the 25th the remains were transported by the naval
authorities, with suitable ceremonies, to the navy-yard gate, where
they were taken in charge by a cavalry escort furnished by the War
Department, and, accompanied by Assistant Secretary of State Loomis,
representing the President, by the British ambassador, the Regents
and the Secretary of the Institution, and the president of the Board of
Commissioners of the District of Columbia, they were conveyed to
the Smithsonian Institution, where the coffin, draped in the American
and British flags, was deposited in the center of the main hall of the
building.

Dr. Bell, addressing Senator Frye in behalf of the Regents, said:

Mr. Senaror: I haye the honor to hand over to the Smithsonian Institution the
mortal remains of its founder, James Smithson, a Fellow of the Royal Society of
London, England, who died in Genoa, Italy, on the 27th of June, 1829.

For nearly seventy-five years the body of Smithson has reposed in an almost for-
gotten grave in the picturesque little British cemetery on the heights of San Beningo,
in Genoa. City improvements have led to the expropriation of this cemetery and
removal of the remains, and at the last meeting of the board of regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution I was appointed a committee to arrange for the transfer of the
remains of Smithson to this country. On my arrival in Genoa every facility was
afforded me for the accomplishment of my mission by the provincial and municipal
authorities, by His British Majesty’s consul-general, Mr. Keene; by the committee
of the British Burial Fund Association, in which is vested the ownership of the
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

cemetery, as well as by our own consul, Mr. William Henry Bishop, to whom I am
much indebted for his yalued services.

On the 31st of December, 1903, the tomb of Smithson was opened in my presence,
as the representative of the Smithsonian Institution, and in the presence of the
American consul and six other witnesses. The remains of Smithson were reverently
raised from the grave and placed in a metallic casket, over which the consul of the
United States cast the American flag, while the witnesses stood around with uncoy-
ered heads. The casket was then left in the mortuary chapel of the cemetery,
securely sealed and under guard, until the 2d of January, when it was placed in a
coffin of strong wood, as demanded by Italian law, and was then transported to the
North German Lloyd steamship Princess Irene, accompanied by the American consul
and myself.

The steamer sailed from Genoa on the 7th of January, and upon arrival in the
United States, the remains of Smithson were received with national honors by diree-
tion of the President, and of the Secretary of the Navy and the Secretary of War.

The remains were brought to Washington on board the U. 8. dispatch boat Dol-
phin, and have been escorted to the Smithsonian Institution by United States cavalry.

And now, Mr. Senator, my mission is ended, and I deliver into your hands, as the
representative of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, the remains
of this great benefactor of the United States.

Senator Frye replied:

Sir: The Smithsonian Institution receives with profound gratitude the remains of
its distinguished founder. Providence, every now and then, seems to place in the
world a man and inspires him with a purpose to elevate his fellow men. Sucha
man was Mr. Smithson, the founder of this Institution. The spirit, sir, which
prompted you to such earnest endeavor, resulting as it did in taking these remains
from their resting place in a country foreign to him and foreign to us, and bringing
them here where for so many years we have enjoyed the rich fruits of his splendid
benefaction, your countrymen will appreciate. His grave here will be an incentive
to earnest, faithful, wise, and discreet endeavor to carry out his lofty purposes, and,
sir, it will be to our people a sacred spot while the Republic endures.

The brief but impressive ceremonies of the occasion concluded with
the following prayer, offered by the Rev. Dr. Randolph H. McKim:

Almighty God, eternal source of light and truth, by whose wise providence all
things in heaven and earth are governed, we give thee thanks that thou didst put
into the heart of thy servant whose dust we receive with reverence here to-day, to
lay the foundation of this school of science, and we pray thee that it may more and
more be instrumental in the true interpretation of the laws of nature, and in unveil-
ing to the mind of man the glory of God in the work of his hands, to the end that
for all the generations to come this Institution may bea beacon light of truth and of
progress, to the glory of God and to the good of mankind. All this we beg through
Him by whom all things were made, Jesus Christ, our Lord. Amen.

The remains rest temporarily in a room which contains the few per-
sonal relics of Smithson, until their final disposal by the Regents.

ADMINISTRATION.

In view of the ever-increasing responsibilities imposed upon the
Institution, both by the administration of its own fund and the several
dependencies placed by Congress under its direction, a system has
been from year to year carefully worked out, which, while retaining
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. iM

in a central office under the Secretary’s supervision, the general plan
of the whole Institution, has rendered it practicable to leave the carry-
ing out of details to those in immediate charge of the work of the
bureaus. I record with gratitude the ever-increasing aid rendered me
by the Regents, as evidenced not only through the increased amount
of time given to the policy of the Institution, but by their advice and
help in all matters, whether of policy or administration, in which their

aid has been sought.
BUILDINGS.

The ceiling of the large anthropological hall in the main Smithsonian
building has been practically reconstructed and the hall has been
painted and decorated anew. There has thus been practically made
available for use the largest single exhibition hall in the building, and
it is expected that the valuable archeological collections of the Institu-
tion will be seen to better advantage than ever before. It is to be
regretted that the uncomfortable tread of the steps and the absence of
an elevator may deter many persons from visiting this very attractive
room.

The repairs to the roof of the main Smithsonian building have been
completed, and much-needed repairs were also made to the roof of the
Museum building.

FINANCES.

The permanent funds of the Institution are as follows:

The above fund is deposited in the Treasury of the United States
and bears interest at 6 per cent per annum under the provisions of the
act organizing the Institution and act of Congress approved March 12,
1894. In addition to the permanent fund, the Regents hold certain
approved railroad bonds which form part of the fund established by
Mr. Hodgkins for investigations into the properties of atmospheric air.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1, 1903, the balance, as
stated in my last report, was $55,507.67. During the year the total
receipts by the Institution were $68,435.56. Of this sum, $57,754.17
was derived from the interest and the remaining $10,681.39 was
received from miscellaneous sources.
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The disbursements during the year amounted to $77,294.90, the
details of which are given in the report of the executive committee.
The balance remaining to the credit of the Secretary on June 30, 1904,
for the expenses of the Institution was $46,648.33. A considerable
part of this balance is held against certain contingent obligations which
may be expected to mature as a result of various scientific investiga-
tions and publications in progress.

During the fiscal year 1904, the Institution was charged by Con-
egress with the disbursement of the following appropriations:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Lo
RESEARCH.

It was a part of the original plan of the Institution that its Secretary
should not give his time wholly to administrative duties, but should
directly aid in its scientific investigations.“

Research work in various fields of science has been continued by the
Institution and its dependencies.

I have made some progress toward the solution of the problem of
mechanical flight, and have been carrying on, with the consent of the
Regents, some experiments for the War Department, at its expense,
and have added other experiments, partly at the expense of the
Institution. Owing to an accident to the launching apparatus it was
not possible to make a satisfactory test of the erodrome, and the
exhaustion of available funds has compelled the abandonment, at least
temporarily, of the experiments.

In the Astrophysical Observatory I have continued work believed
to be important, and inaugurated some experiments of novel interest,
which are referred to later.

Through the Museum and the Bureau of American Ethnology the’
Institution has been enabled to carry on various biological, geological,
and ethnological researches, which will be found fully described else-
where in this report and need not be repeated here

HODGKINS FUND.

Series of experiments conducted with the aid of grants from the
Hodgkins fund of the Institution are still in progress. Among those
sufficiently advanced to permit publication, the investigations of Dr.
Carl Barus may be mentioned. Two memoirs detailing the earlier
results of these experiments have already been issued in the Smith-
sonian Contributions to Knowledge, and a third report is now
awaited, which will record experiments on the ionization and nucl
tion of aiv in contact with phosphorus and with water nuclei. Other
interesting data in regard to the diffusion of vapor into nucleated air,
periodic color distribution in coronas, etc., will be given in this
memoir, which will probably be issued during the present year.

Dr. E. W. Scripture, of Yale University, to whom a grant was
awarded for the construction of a ‘* vowel organ,” has been prosecut-
ing his researches for the last year in Berlin. He reports numerous
interesting experiments in the construction of resonators of various
materials with which he has succeeded | in producing the different vowel

« Resolved, That ite Secretary continue his researches in physical science, and pre-
sent such factsand principles as may be developed for publication in the Smithsonian
contributions. (Adopted at meeting of the Board of Regents January 26, 1847.)
14 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

sounds. Doctor Scripture says the problem now before him is to
replace the material used in the artificial glottis he has constructed, by
a substance which can be more perfectly adapted to his purpose in some
essentials than any he has hitherto availed himself of. When this
object is attained, he expects to be able to construct an organ which
can sing the vowels, or a yowel register which, attached to a pipe
organ, may be effectively used in church music.

The memoir of Dr. Victor Schumann, of Leipzig, on the ‘* Absorp-
tion and Emission of the Gases of Atmospheric Air in the Ultra-Violet
Spectrum,” mentioned in my last report as in course of publication,
has now been issued in Volume X XIX of the Smithsonian Contribu-
tions to Knowledge. The special apparatus, devised and constructed
by the author, is shown by plates in the memoir, and the method of
using it described. Although Doctor Schumann considers this investi-
gation but preliminary to further research in this region of the spec-
trum, specialists recognize that a notable step in advance has been
made by the persevering and able work described in this memoir.

Photographs of the apparatus used by Prof. William Hallock in his
Hodgkins research on the composition of vowel sounds, together with
the curves drawn by the synthetic analyzer, have been submitted with
a detailed description of the same. Although unexpected difficulties
have been encountered in transferring the records to the magnetic
wire, the investigation is reported as progressing, on the whole, satis-
factorily, and sound records, secured by means of the complicated and
ingenious apparatus made use of, are to be submitted.

A memoir summarizing the research of Dr. M. W. Travers, **On
the Attainment of Very Low Temperatures,” has now been issued as
No. 1441 of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections. The investi-
gations of Doctor Travers, who has recently been appointed to the
chair of chemistry in University College, Bristol, England, which have
been temporarily suspended while awaiting the reconstruction of some
parts of the apparatus essential to the investigation, are soon to be
resumed, when further progress will be reported to the Institution.

Dr. R. von Lendenfeld, of the University of Prague, who was aided
in 1900 by a grant from the Hodgkins fund for a study of the motion
of birds in actual free flight, has recently submitted a paper on the
structure of bird’s wing feathers, written by Dr. E. Mascha, with
the aid and under the supervision of Doctor von Lendenfeld. This
paper, which treats of the morphology and physiology of flight feath-
ers (remiges), studied microscopically, is of interest in connection with
the Hodgkins research of Doctor yon Lendenfeld, which I have men-
tioned in former reports.

The subscription of the Institution to the Journal of Terrestrial
Magnetism and Atmospheric Electricity has been again continued, the
copies thus secured being distributed, as before, to domestic and for-

——— ae ee

eign libraries and establishments especially interested in the subjects
treated of by the journal.

A grant has been approved on behalf of Dr. A. F. Zahm, professor
of physical science in the Catholic University of America, in Wash-
ington City, for a series of experiments on the laws of atmospheric
resistance to moving bodies. This research, which is still in proeress,
will be reported on later.

The experiments of Mr. Alexander Larsen, of Chicago, on lightning
flashes and fluorescence, carried on by means of simple mechanism
adapted and arranged by himself, have been aided by a moderate grant
from the Hodgkins fund. These experiments, which are now in prog-
ress, are expected to yield results of scientific value.

In view of the numerous inquiries received from investigators and
specialists, it may be again stated that the Hodgkins prize competition
of the Institution was definitely closed December 31, 1894, and that no
further competition on any subject is at present proposed by the Insti-
tution. A recent circular stating the conditions which, in accordance
with the will of the donor, govern the administration of the Hodgkins
fund, including also a mention of the Hodgkins medal, which may be
awarded for important contributions to our knowledge of the nature
and properties of atmospheric air, and stating the conditions govern-
ing the award of grants which are occasionally approved, is sent. to
those requesting it. A brief history of the Hodgkins foundation, not-
ing the medals and prizes awarded, and mentioning the investigations
which have been furthered by the fund, has been published in the
Quarterly Issue of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.

NAPLES TABLE.

The question of the renewal of the lease of a table in the Naples
Zoological Station, which was held under advisement for some months,
was finally decided in the affirmative, and the contract renewed on
behalf of the Institution for three years from January 1, 1904.

Since this action, applications for the seat have been received, and
that of Prof. J. B. Johnston, head of the Department of Zoology in
the University of West Virginia, which had been submitted a second
time, in compliance with the rule of action observed in the interest of
all candidates, was approved for six months from September 1, 1904.
Doctor Johnston is the author of several important papers on the com-
parative anatomy of the brain and cranial nerves of the lower verte-
brates, and his session will afford undoubted advantages for his study
of the problems of vertebrate morphology and the evolution of the
nervous system.

The additions to the buildings at the Naples Station now in progress
will add much to the space available for research, and this, together
with the larger number of tables now supported by scientific institu-
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tions in the United States, will tend to obviate the not infrequent
application by several students at the same time for the Smithsonian
seat, a matter of regret, as in such a case some applicants must be dis-
appointed, since an excess of workers at the same table is a source of
inconvenience to Doctor Dohrn, the courteous director of the Station.
It is. however, desired in the interest of science that the Smithsonian
table should be continuously occupied during the months available for
study at Naples, and all applications for the seat receive immediate
consideration. A brief account of the administration of the Smithso-
nian table in the Naples Station, embodying the data which is likely to
be of use to applicants, has recently been published in the Quarterly
Issue of the Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections.

It is a pleasure to state that the advisory committee remains
unchanged, and to express thanks for the helpful attention given to
all questions referred to the committee for consideration.

EXPLORATIONS.

The Institution has this year made explorations through its private
funds, such as the Alaskan mammoth expedition, and that to the
Canadian glaciers, mentioned below, in addition to the customary
biological, geological, and ethnological ones through the National
Museum and the Bureau of American Ethnology.

Alaskan mammoth expedition.—About the middle of May the Insti-
tution dispatched an expedition to Alaska under the direction of Mr.
A.G. Maddren. The most important work sought to be accomplished
is the collecting of remains of the mammoth and other large mammals,
which have been reported as abundant in various regions, one place
being known as the ** Bone Yard,” another as Elephant Point, along
the south shore of Kotzebue Sound. :

Exploration of Canadian glaciers.—An exploration of some of the
glaciers of British Columbia has been undertaken by Dr. Work
Sherzer, of Michigan, under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion, for the purpose of gathering definite information regarding
glacial phenomena, such as the nature and cause of the ice flow, the
temperature of the ice at various depths, and its relation to air tem-
peratures, the amount of surface melting, and the possible transfer-
ence of material from the surface to lower portions. The special
field of study will be the five most accessible glaciers along the line of
the Canadian Pacific Railway, including the Victoria glacier at Lake
Louise, the Wapta glacier in the Joho Valley, and the Asulkan, and
Ilecillewalt glaciers near Glacier House.

PUBLICATIONS.

The Institution distributed during the year a total of 45,705 vol-
umes or parts of volumes of the series of Smithsonian Contributions,
REPORT OF THE SEORETARY. iy
Miscellaneous Collections, Reports and publications not included in
the regular series.“:

In the publications of the Institution the double aim of its founder is
represented, in that it should exist both for the ‘‘increase” and the
**diffusion” of knowledge.

The recording of results of original researches, the
knowledge, is chiefly through the Contribution to Knowledge, a quarto
series begun in 1848, and in which 145 memoirs, collected in 33 vol-
umes, have so far been published.

Three memoirs have been added to this series, one on the moon, one
on reflecting telescopes, and one on whalebone whales.

The moon memoir, by Prof. N.S. Shaler, entitled ‘‘A Comparison
of the Features of the Earth and Moon,” is a work of 79 pages of text,
with 25 full page illustrations, each of them accompanied by a descrip-
tion of the principal objects shown.

As stated in my last report, I have for more than twelve years past
been preparing the material for the publication of a work, on the part
of the Smithsonian Institution, which it was hoped would consist essen-
tially of photographic views of the moon, so complete and, it was
expected (with the advance of photography), so minute, that the fea-
tures of our satellite might be studied in them by the geologists and
the selenographer, nearly as well as by the astronomer at the telescope.
This hope has only been partially fulfilled, for photography, which
has made such eminent advances in the reproduction of nebule and
like celestial features, has indeed progressed in lunar work, but not to
the same extent as in other fields. The expectation that such a com-
plete work could be advantageously published for this purpose has,
then, been laid aside for the present.

It was decided to draw from the material prepared for this larger
work, some photographs taken at the Lick Observatory and the
Paris Observatory, and particularly some recently obtained by Pro-
fessor Ritchey at the Yerkes Observatory, for which I have to express
the thanks of the Institution. These illustrations are attached to the
present paper by Professor Shaler, and may, then, be considered to be
a separate contribution by the Institution to the study of selenography.

Professor Shaler’s memoir gives the results of personal studies car-
ried on for a third of a century. He has devoted about one hundred
nights to telescopie study of the moon with the Mertz equatorial of
Harvard College Observatory, his later researches having been chiefly
by means of photographs at Harvard University, with which he has so
long been connected.

A memoir of 106 pages, with 13 full-page illustrations and many
text figures, consists of a reprint of a work by Professor Draper on

the construction of a silvered glass telescope, accompanied by a paper
by Prof. G. W. Ritchey on the modern reflecting telescope and the
making and testing of optical mirrors.

For few papers published by the institution has there been a more
constant demand than for this memoir by Prof. Henry Draper, entitled
**On the Construction of a Silvered Glass Telescope,” originally issued
forty years ago, in 1864. The paper is of remarkable merit as a sum-
mary of, and an addition to, the knowledge existing at the time, but
during the long interval which has elapsed, progress has been made
in various directions and by various hands. On the occasion of a new
edition of this classic memoir, it was sought to give an account of the
latest knowledge on the subject, and I was gratified to be able to obtain
from Mr. Ritchey, whose labors in this direction are so well known,
an account of the processes which he has employed for making the
ereat mirrors that have been so effective at the Yerkes Observatory,
and it has been decided to republish, with the original Draper memoir,
but as an entirely independent contribution to the subject, the present
article by Mr. Ritchey. The great refracting instruments which have
been produced in recent years have not superseded the use of the
reflector, which, on the contrary, is occupying a more and more impor-
tant place. The reader is here presented with the most recent methods
and results needed in the construction of great mirrors for modern
reflecting telescopes.

The work on whales is by Dr. Frederick W. True, head curator of
Biology in the National Museum, and treats in an exhaustive manner
of the whalebone whales of the western North Atlantic compared with
those occurring in European waters, with some observations on the
species of the North Pacific. It makes a volume of 337 pages, with
50 full-page illustrations and 97 text figures.

Doctor True has here brought together extensive original data rela-
tive to the external and osteological characters of the large whales of
the western North Atlantic, for the purpose of determining whether the
species are the same on both sides of that ocean. The facts have been
derived from a study of fresh specimens at the Newfoundland whaling
stations, the collection of the United States National Museum, and the
skeletons in other large museums of the United States. Special study
was given to the type specimens of American species proposed by
Prof. E. D. Cope and Capt. C. M. Scammon, all of which, with one
exception, were examined by the author,

The investigation is preparatory to a study of the geographical dis-
tribution and migrations of the larger cetaceans in the North Atlantic,
which could not be undertaken until the identity of the species them-
selves was determined. Numerous facts, however, relating to the
occurrence of whales at different points off the coasts of North
America and the seasons of their appearance and disappearance, have

ee eee ee)
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

been assembled. The results of the investigation show that several
American species which have been proposed are quite certainly nomi-
nal, and that, as a whole, the species of the Atlantic coast of North
America can not be distinguished from those of Kuropean waters.
Some attention has been paid to the whales of the North Pacific. The
information previously recorded has been brought together in orderly
sequence and various new facts added, but the amount of material at
present available is insufficient to serve as a basis for discrimination
of closely allied species. It is certain, however, that the whales of
the North Pacific, with one exception, bear an extremely close resem-
blance to those of the North Atlantic. The California Gray whale,
Rhachianectes glaucus, has no counterpart in the Atlantic. One well
known European species, the Pollack whale, Balenoptera borealis, not
previously known in North American waters, was observed at the New-
foundland whaling stations while this volume was passing through the
press. The illustrations include views of the type specimens of the
Species proposed by Cope and Scammon; also numerous representa-
tions of the different individuals of the Common Finback and the
Sulphurbottom, from photographs taken by the author at the New-
foundland whaling stations. The latter are of special value for the
study of individual variation in these huge animals.

The series of Smithsonian Miscellaneous Collections is intended to
include all the publications issued directly by the Smithsonian Institu-
tion in octavo form, excepting the Annual Report, which is a Con-
gressional document. In the Collections are included reports on the
present state of our knowledge of particular branches of science;
instructions for collecting and digesting facts and materials for
research; lists and synopses of species of the organic and inorganic
world; Museum catalogues; reports of explorations; aids to biblio-
graphical investigations, etc., generally prepared at the express request
of the Institution and at its expense.

A NEW QUARTERLY ISSUE.

Since 1862, when the series of Miscellaneous Collections was begun,
there have been published 45 volumes, made up of several hundred
individual papers.

In order to afford a medium for the early publication of the results
of researches conducted by the Smithsonian Institution and its bureaus,
and especially for the publication of reports of a preliminary nature,
I have decided during the past year to establish a quarterly issue of
the Miscellaneous Collections, which shall not supersede’ the regular
series, but be a part of it. Each number of the quarterly is planned
to consist of about 144 pages of text and to be suitably illustrated.
The first volume has been completed, and makes a book of 463 pages,
2() REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

including 28 papers, with 103 plates and 45 text figures, as enumerated
by the editor in the appendix to this report.

To the regular series of Miscellaneous Collections the following
papers have been added:

The Literature of Thorium, by Dr. Cavalier H. Jotiet; Phylogeny of
Fusus and its Allies, by Prof. A. W. Grabau; Researches on the
Attainment of Very Low Temperatures, by Prof. Morris W. Travers,
and a Select Bibliography of Chemistry (Second Supplement), by Dr.
H. C. Bolton.@

There was in press at the close of the year a Catalogue of Diptera,
by Prof. J. M. Aldrich, and Researches in Helminthology and Parasit-
ology, by Dr. Joseph Leidy.

The Smithsonian Report is printed as a Congressional document and
is its only publication of which the edition is large enough to permit
even a limited distribution to individuals. In the general appendix to
the report it has been my especial aim to include, as heretofore, papers
ot scientific importance, treated in a way to be understood by the lay
student. The Report for 1903 has been put in type, but had not been
delivered by the printer at the close of the fiscal year. The volume
ube the Secretary’s report to the Regents for the year ending
June 30, 1903, the proceedings of the Regents’ meeting of January 28,
1908, a the report of the Executive Committee dated January 25,
1904, besides the general appendix of about 50 papers on scientific
subjects relating chiefly to the calendar year 1903.

Among the many manuscripts left unfinished by the late Dr. G.
Brown Goode, there is a group of chapters dealing with the progress
of science in America. In accordance with the author’s liberal inter-
pretation of the meaning of science, the work does not confine itself
to the physical and natural sciences, but contains notes on anthropology,
philology, bibliography, and kindred subjects. As Doctor Goode was
eminently the historian of American science, it seems especially fitting
that the Smithsonian Institution should undertake the publication of
these memoirs, even if incomplete. The manuscript is now being
worked over and I hope that in the near future these notes will in
book form serve as a foundation for and a stimulus to further work in
the same direction.

LIBRARY.

The accessions to the Smithsonian deposit in the Library of Con
gress during the year aggregated 2,286 volumes, 21,467 parts of vol-
umes and pamphlets, and 215 charts, making a total of 25,968 cata-
logue entries, equivalent to nearly 15,000 octavo volumes. Additions

aggregating 7,893 entries have been made to the libraries of the Secre-
tary. Office, Astrophysical Observatory, the National Zoological
Park, and the National Museum. In the Museum library there are
now 20,548 bound volumes and 35.950 unbound papers.

General de Peyster continues to add many valuable volumes to the
Watts de Peyster Collection Napoléon Buonaparte, and there have also
been received from him several oil paintings, and many historical
relics of the American colonial period.

International Cataloque of Scientific Literature.—Vhe Institution
has continued the work of indexing scientific publications, the total
number of references sent to the central bureau at London during the
year aggregating 21,213, or an increase of 50 per cent over the pre-
vious year, which was made possible by an addition to the allotment
from the Smithsonian fund for this work. The first annual issue of
the catalogue has now been published and distributed, and also several
volumes of the second annual issue.

JORRESPONDENCE.

As in former years, a great many inquiries on almost every known
subject have been received by the Institution, and although many of
these did not relate directly to its operations, it has, in accordance with
the purpose of its foundation—*‘ the increase and diffusion of knowl-
edge ”—cheerfully furnished the information, as far as practicable, in
each case, notwithstanding the fact that this frequently required the
expenditure of considerable time by the members of its staff.

All correspondence in any way affecting the policy of the Institution
or its bureaus has, as heretofore, received the Secretary’s personal
attention, while letters relating to the work of the National Museum,
the Bureau of American Ethnology, and the National Zoological Park,
not included in the above class, have been acted on directly by the
Assistant Secretary in charge of the Museum, the Chief of the Bureau,
and the Superintendent of the park.

During the year many plans and descriptions of devices of various
kinds have been submitted to the Institution for an expression of opin-
ion as to their merits. These requests the Secretary has been compelled
to decline by reason of the decision of the Board of Regents, made
during the early years of the Institution, which prohibits him from
expressing an opinion upon the merits of any patentable invention.

No important changes have been made in the system of conducting
correspondence, which was inaugurated in 1890, and which has con-
tinued to be found an effective means of preventing any unnecessary
delay in its dispatch.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

INTERNATIONAL AMERICAN ARCHAOLOGICAL COMMISSION.

At the Second International Conference of the American Republics,
held in the City of Mexico on January 29, 1902, a resolution was
adopted recommending that an—

‘* International American Archeological Commission be formed through
the appointment by the President of each of the American Republics
of one or more members of such commission; * * * that the first
meeting for the organization of the commission, the election of officers
and adoption of rules shall occur in the city of Washington once
withia two years from this date; that the commission shall have power
to appoint subcommissions, which shall be charged specially with the
explorations or other work committed to its care; that subcommissions
may be appointed which shall cause the cleaning and preservation of
the ruins of the principal prehistoric cities, establishing at each of them
a museum to contain objects of interest found in the locality, and, at
such exhumed cities, to establish conveniences for the visiting public;
that the commission endeavor to establish an American International
Museum which is to become the center of all the investigations and inter-
pretations, and that it be established in the city selected by the majority
of the Republics acquiescing in this recommendation.” * * *

The attention of the Smithsonian Institution was called to this pro-
posed commission through a letter from the secretary of the confer-
ence, dated May 26, 1902, asking for suggestions as to the best
methods to be pursued to bring about the early establishment of the
commission and its effective organization.

A preliminary meeting of representatives appointed by some of the
Republics to consider the proposed commission was held at the
Department of State on April 15, 1903, and adjourned to the third
Monday of December.

On May 15, 1903, the Secretary of State submitted to me for con-
sideration, and an expression of views thereon, a proposed plan of
organization of the commission.

On December 21, 1903, a meeting of the diplomatic representatives
of the American Republics was held at the Department of State in the
interest of the organization of the International Archeological Com-
mission, when representatives of the Smithsonian Institution were
invited to state to those present the position of the Institution in
reoard to the work of the proposed commission, and to submit such
views in writing, to be printed in the proceedings of the meeting, for
the information of the several Republics, and adjournment was had
until the third Monday in December, 1904.

On February 16, 1904, in response to a request from the Secretary
of State, the following letter was submitted:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

practically no action was taken at the last meeting alluded to. I have, in accordance

MEMORANDUM CONCERNING THE PROPOSED COOPERATION AMONG THE AMERICAN REPUB-
LICS FOR THE PROMOTION OF ARCHEOLOGICAL AND ETHNOLOGICAL RESEARCH.

The Smithsonian Institution strongly favors international cooperation in the
furthering of scientific work. It initiated and is at present engaged in the interna-
tional exchange of scientific publications, having agencies throughout the world,
besides acting on behalf of the United States Government for the exchange of public
documents. It is also acting as the representative of the United States in the
compilation of the International Catalogue of Scientific Literature.

There is especial force in such cooperation among the American Republics for the
proraotion of archeological and ethnological research, and, for that matter, among
all the countries upon the American continent and the adjacent islands, since the
problems, so far as they relate to the aboriginal populations, are not defined by
present political boundaries. British, Dutch, French, or other foreign possessions
on the American continent or in the West Indies could with advantage be included
in the project.

This cooperation can be best furthered in the first instance by the stimulation of
the organizations already in existence for these studies in the yarious countries. The
work is in almost all of the American countries carried on at present by the national
museums. In the United States it is carried on by the National Museum and the
Bureau of American Ethnology. Wherever such exist it is desirable that they should
have the opportunity of an exchange of views and the comparison of work to be
undertaken in order that the great problem, which can only be solved by coordina-
tion of research, shall be taken up with the greatest efficiency and economy. An
organization of the heads of museums and scientific government bureaus haying to
do with archzeology or ethnology could be effected through the Bureau of American
Republics, an existing organization.

To further stimulate archeological work each American Republic or other State
willing to adhere to the scheme might undertake to secure the passage of laws
declaring archzeological and historical objects of unusual interest reserved, and that
excavations thereon should be undertaken only by properly organized museums and
all waste of archzeological objects should be prevented.

The director of the national museum in each country, the head of a bureau or
department devoted to the study of archzeology and ethnology, or, where there are
none such, some other official duly appointed, should, in executing the law for the
protection of antiquities, have a recording officer who should secure a list of all
objects taken from the ground.

The passage of laws prohibiting the manufacture of spurious antiquities is also
desirable. Such laws, being national laws, would necessarily be executed by
national authorities, and each republic or other country or province would be
autonomous in this respect.
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

An archeeological survey of America, undertaken by the various States systematic-
ally, and upon a well-defined plan, would render an important service to the progress
of archeological science, and is a preliminary to systematic research.

Whenever a museum or scientific establishment exists now undertaking archzeo-
logical and ethnological work this should remain the representation of the specific
country for such work. The interchange of duplicates among American museums,
which is already being carried on to a considerable extent, should be continued and
increased, in order that each American national museum should finally have as good a
series as is obtainable of all American archielogical objects of interest. Care should be
taken, however, not to let this idea interfere in,the proper exchange of specimens
between museums on this continent and elsewhere, since most museums, while sup-
ported by nations, are really international in character, and it is to the interest of
American museums that they shall exchange American material for foreign material,
as it is to the interest of foreign museums that they shall have material representing
American archzeology. It is only by securing archeeological and ethnological series
from all countries that comparative studies can be successfully entered upon.

While uniformity is not sought, the American museums should exchange with each
other plans of cases, information with regard to methods of installation and kinds of
labels, and regulations concerning the preservation of type specimens, and the lend-
ing of specimens from one museum to the other for study or other purposes, in order

that each national museum may have all methods before it to assist in adopting such

as are best suited to its own peculiar needs.

The existence of a unique object, manuscript, or codex, without its reproduction
by cast, photograph, or other mechanical means, renders it possible in the event of
fire or other disaster that all the knowledge represented by these objects will be lost
to the world. The copying by mechanical means of such specimens and their
exchange among the various countries is suggested as one of the most important
pieces of work that could be undertaken by international cooperation.

The projects originally presented to the conference of the American Republics at
the City of Mexico, in so far as these are practicable, can best be carried out in the
following manner: That the directors of the national museums of the American
Republics and States, or, in case where there be none, then other representatives of
these countries, be constituted as a body, with wholly advisory functions, to meet
once every three years, or oftener should occasion arise, to consider archzeological
and ethnological interests. The meetings and deliberations of this body should be
conducted under the auspices of the Bureau of American Republics, which might
publish such reports as might be approved by a proper committee of the meeting.
The organization here suggested to carry out the purposes of the project could be
effected with slight expense to the States adhering to the plan.

INTERNATIONAL CONGRESSES AND EXPOSITIONS.

The Institution was called upon during the year to designate dele-
gates to an unusual number of international scientific congresses, and
several more were under consideration at the close of the fiscal year.

Congress of Americanists.—Myr. William H. Holmes, Chief of the
Bureau of American Ethnology, was appointed delegate of the Insti-
tution to the Fourteenth International Congress of Ameyicanists to be
held at Stuttgart, August 18-23, 1904, and upon nomination by the
Institution the following persons were accredited by the Department
of State as United States delegates to the same congress: Dr. Franz

Boas, of the American Museum of Natural History; Mr. Marshall H.
Saville, of the Columbia University; Dr. George H. Dorsey, of the
Field Columbian Museum, and Doctor Currier, of the Catholic
University of America.

Congress of Zoology.—Messrs. Leonhard Stejneger and Gerrit 5.
Miller, jr., of the United States National Museum, were appointed
representatives of the Institution and the Museum at the Sixth Inter-
national Congress on Zoology, to be held at Berne, Switzerland,
August 14-19.

Congress of Education.—Dr. Cyrus Adler was appointed delegate
of the Smithsonian Institution to the International Congress of Edu-
cation, held in St. Louis June 28 to July 1, 1904, but finding it impos-
sible to attend he was represented by Dr. Marcus W. Lyon, jr., of the
National Museum.

Congress of Orientalists.—Prof. Paul Haupt, honorary curator of
the Division of Historic Archeology in the United States National
Museum, was appointed representative of the Smithsonian Institution
and the National Museum at the Fourteenth International Congress of
Orientalists, to be held at Algiers in April, 1905.

Congress of Geology.—Mr. Charles Schuchert, of the National
Museum, was appointed delegate of the Institution to the Ninth Inter-
national Geological Congress held at Vienna, August 20-29 1908. He
reports that there were 855 members in attendance, including 22 from
the United States. The standard of the papers presented was high.
One day was occupied by 7 speakers from various parts of the world
in presenting a synopsis of present knowledge of crystalline rocks.
Another day was devoted to ‘* Faults and Clefts,” and a third day was :
given toa presentation of the geology of the Balkan Peninsula and
the Orient.

Archxological Congress.—Dr. Franz Boas was appointed United
States delegate to the Congress of the Archwological and Historical
Federation of Belgium, to be held at Mons in July and August, 1004.

Louisiana Purchase Exposition.—By an act of Congress approved
Mareh 3, 1901, liberal provision was made for an exhibit at the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition by the Executive Departments, the
Smithsonian Institution, the National Museum, the Fish Commission,
and the Department of Labor, ‘‘of such articles and objects as illus-
trate the functions and administrative faculty of the Government in
time of peace and its resources as a war power, tending to demonstrate
the nature of our institutions and their adaptation to the wants of the
people.” The preparation of this exhibit was placed in charge of a
Government board upon which Dr. Frederick W. True, head curator
of the department of biology in the National Museum, was appointed
as representative of the Smithsonian Institution. The exposition was
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

postponed from 1903 to 1904, and opportunity was thus offered for the
preparation of an adequate display that might illustrate the functions
of the Institution and its dependencies.

The Smithsonian exhibit proper is installed in the Government build-
ing in a pavilion which overlooks the space assigned to its various
bureaus. It contains memorials and a portrait of the founder, James
Smithson, and a complete series of the several hundred publications of
the Institution, which represents one of the chief means adopted for
‘arrying out his purpose ‘* The increase and diffusion of knowledge.”
Portraits of the chancellors and secretaries of the Institution are also
shown, as well as that of Mr. Thomas George Hodgkins, the donor of
the Hodgkins fund. Printed matter, setting forth the objects to which
this fund is devoted and the reports of important original researches
which it has aided by means of grants, are also exhibited, with repro-
ductions of the Hodgkins gold medal, which is awarded biennially for
noteworthy investigations regarding the nature of atmospheric air in
connection with the welfare of man. One of the features of the
exhibit is a quarter-size model of the large aerodrome with which
experiments were conducted during the summer and autumn of 1903,
a model, driven by a gasoline engine, which itself has flown a distance
of nearly a quarter of a mile. The steam-driven model with which
experiments were successfully made in 1896 is also exhibited.

The work of the Astrophysical Observatory is illustrated in a
graphic manner by the installation of the great coelostat, arranged to
throw a beam of sunlight into a darkened room where there is shown
a solar image about a yard in diameter, thrown up by a 6-inch tele-
scope, and the solar spectrum is formed upon the walls by a large
concave grating. Bolometric apparatus is in actual operation, while
a display of transparencies illustrates the apparatus and results of
researches by the Observatory.

Charts and other objects are displayed explanatory of the useful
work carried on by the International Exchanges in distributing scien-
tific publications throughout the world.

The various departments of the National Museum are fully repre-
sented. Among some of the objects displayed I may mention a resto-
ration of the extinct reptile known as the Stegasaur, about 25 feet
long, which is not unlike a large horned toad, with a double row of
large, flat spines along the tail; a collection of meteorites and casts of
some of the largest meteorites known, one of them exceeding 20 feet
in length and weighing many tons; a collection of some of the most
beautiful kinds of minerals from all parts of the world; the model of a
whale 80 feet long as showing the appearance of the greatest of all
living animals; groups of game birds, the wonderful birds of paradise,
the gorgeous pheasants, and birds of prey; and a remarkably perfect

egg of the gigantic bird of Madagascar, the Aepyornis, the egg meas-
uring about a foot long.

The Children’s Room in the Institution is reproduced in full size,
together with its cases, aquaria, bird cages, decorations, and as many
of the objects as could be duplicated. There is thus shown a lillipu-
tian museum which has proved very attractive to the older as well as
younger visitors to the Exposition.

A gigantic bird cage, in which many species of birds have almost as
much freedom of movement as if they were without restraint by bars
and nets, illustrates the National Zoological Park.

The collections are mentioned with somewhat more detail in the
Appendix, and in the report by Doctor True, to be published later in
another volume, full details will be given of these exhibits as well as
descriptions of some great models of Mayan temples of Yucatan,
shown by the Bureau of American Ethnology.

Lewis and Clark Exposition.—Congress during the past year made
provision for a Government exhibit at an exposition to be opened at
Portland, Oreg., in May, 1905, to commemorate the centennial of the
Lewis and Clark Expedition to the Northwest, and Dr. F. W. True
has been designated as representative of the Institution to prepare :
suitable Smithsonian exhibit.

MISCELLANEOUS.

University of Wisconsin.—Dr. James B. Angeil, president of the
University of Michigan and Regent of the Smithsonian Institution,
represented the Institution at the celebration of the fiftieth anniver-
sary of the first commencement of the University of Wisconsin, held
at Madison during the week beginning June 5, 1904, and presented
the congratulations, signed by the Secretary, in the following form:

The Smithsonian Institution extends to the president, the regents, and the faculty
of the University of Wisconsin its congratulations on the occasion of the fiftieth anni-
versary of the first commencement of the university. It felicitates the university on
the important work accomplished by it for learning and education in the State of
Wisconsin, and, recognizing its influence also in sister institutions of learning, sends
heartiest wishes for its continued prosperity and usefulness.

NATIONAL MUSEUM.

The most notable event of the year was that on June 15, 1904,
ground was broken for the new Museum building which was author-
ized by act of Congress approved March 3, 1903, the first sod being
turned by me in the presence of the architects, the superintendent of
construction, and the officers and employees of the Institution and
its dependencies. The new structure will be erected on the north-
ern side of the Smithsonian Park and will be about 551 feet long
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

giving a floor area of about 94 acres in its four

and 318 feet wide, ¢
stories.

The year which sees this most important material accession has been
one in which the Museum’s most important possession, in the men of
science who have devoted themselves to its work with a disinterested
zeal, has suffered a loss in the resignation of a number of its staff,
from the lack of appreciation by Congress which would permit it to retain
their services. The time in the Museum’s history has come, anticipated
in my previous reports, when the staff so slowly gathered, and which
is to occupy this new building, is beginning to decline. I feel com-

pelled here at the outset to call attention to the inadequate salaries

paid to the scientific and clerical staff of the Museum, a circumstance

that during the past year has caused the resignation of several of the —

curators, who have accepted similar positions offering greater com-
pensation in other cities. An increase in the Museum appropriation
has been asked of Congress, since under the present appropriation it
is impossible to maintain a proper staff of efficient scientific assistants
or clerical help.

Good progress has been made in the regular operations of the
Museum, although much time of the scientific staff has been devoted
to the preparation of exhibits for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition.

The new accessions aggregated 241,547 specimens, making the pres-
ent total census of collections 5,891,000 objects. Important new
accessions in the anthropological, biological, and geological depart-
ments are enumerated by the Assistant Secretary in the appendix to
this report.

I may mention here the continued interest in the National Collec-
tions manifested by Dr. W. L. Abbott, who each year presents to the
Museum many objects collected by him during his anthropological
and natural history researches in the Far East, the specimens received
during the last year consisting chiefly of ethnological objects from the
Malay Peninsula and northern Sumatra. Ethnological specimens col-
lected in the Philippine Islands by Drs. KE. A. Mearns and R. B. Grubb, of
the United States Army, and objects of interest collected in Alaska by
Lieut. G. T. Emmons, of the United States Navy, evidence the pres-
ent interest of many Government officials in the work of the National
Museum. The Bureau of Ordnance of the War Department has
deposited 615 varieties of firearms of historical value.

The National Museum acquires its collections mainly through Goy-
ernment surveys, by gift and by exchange, but, depending upon these
means alone, its collections can never be made complete in any par-
ticular. Provision should be made for filling at least the more
important gaps by purchase. The objects to be obtained in this man-
ner are generally such as find their way into the hands of individuals
who have been at greater or less expense in obtaining them, and who,

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

therefore, can not be expected to part with them except by sale.
About four years ago a specific item for purchase was agreed to by
Congress, and while the sum allowed was altogether inadequate to
meet the requirements of the Museum, yet through it many important
objects were secured. In the appropriation bill for the past year this
item was omitted by Congress, and many objects which should have
come into the possession of the Government have been obtained by
other museums. This is especially the case in connection with the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition, where exceptional opportunities were
presented for enriching the National Collections with needed material.

When the Museum building was erected, the need of a working
library actually at hand was felt, and through the generosity of Pro-
fessor Baird, who presented his entire private collection of scientific
publications to the National Museum, the nucleus for such a library
was established. In the years following, the Library of Congress
became so overcrowded that it was glad to have retained at the Museum
as much of the Smithsonian Library as was useful, and to send down
for indefinite deposit as many of the Smithsonian books as were
required. This condition no longer obtains, however, and an enlarged
working library for the Museum has become absolutely essential, if
the provisions of Congressional enactments for the classification and
arrangement of its collections are to be carried into effect. The sums
of money heretofore available have not sufticed even for the purchase
of all such books needed in the work as were not contained in the col-
lection of the Library of Congress or in the Smithsonian deposit, and
the increase requested is a low estimate for the actual requirements of
the Museum.

The National Museum is open to the public only on week days, from
9a.m. to 4.30 p. m., and its important educational features are restricted
to persons having leisure only during ofticial hours. It has long been
urged that means be granted for so extending the hours of opening
that no one shall be deprived of the advantages which it offers for
instruction and enlightenment. Such an arrangement has been in suc-
cessful operation at the Library of Congress for several years, and a
similar course has long been followed by the larger museums elsewhere
in this country and in most European capitals. The National Museum
has recently been provided with a complete installation of electric
wires and lamps, and could, therefore, be opened both evenings and Sun-
days at the mere cost of the necessary additional supplies and help. The
Smithsonian building, however, has not yet been furnished with the
means for lighting the public halls, but could be opened on Sundays.
The expense involved is that needed for obtaining the extra amount of
coal and of electric current required, and for the employment of a few
additional persons to supplement the night and Sunday watch force,
830 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

which is very small. Three plans are suggested for the extension of
the hours of opening. The first includes every week-day evening and
Sundays; the second, three evenings during each week and every Sun-
day; the third, Sundays only. The first plan most strongly commends
itself.

The progress of the work of classifying and arranging the collec-
tions both for exhibition and for study has been greatly retarded, as
during many years past, by lack of space and by reason of the insufli-
cient force provided. The difficulty in regard to space will cease with
the completion of the new building authorized by Congress in 19038,
but that completion is still years distant. I can not too strongly urge
that when the building is ready an adequate staff of scientific men can
not be improvised, but ‘that such an one must be largely gathered in
the time which now offers for preparation if one is to be provided
adequate to the demand.

BUREAU, OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The past year’s work of the Bureau has continued mainly along the
usual lines, and in a number of directions is making rapid progress
toward final results.

The research work among the aborigines has been carried forward
in four widely distributed regions—among the Haida tribes of the
Queen Charlotte Islands and southern Alaska; among the Pueblo
Indians of New Mexico; among a number of tribes of the great plains
in Oklahoma and Indian Territory, and in the West Indies where the
interesting and obscure problems of the ancient remains and tribal
remnants are receiving deserved attention. The studies in these sey-
eral fields are now gradually approaching completion, and monographs
embodying the results are in hand.

In the field of linguistics much attention has been given to the col-
lection of data from the tribes and the preparation of a handbook of
the American languages, which is expected to mark a very decided
advance in the knowledge of primitive tongues.

An important feature of the year’s work was the preparation and
installation of an exhibit intended to illustrate at the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition certain phases of the Bureau’s work, and special
studies were pursued and collections made for this purpose.

A measure for the preservation of our national antiquities was intro
duced in the Senate by Senator Cullom, and a similar measure was
offered in the House of Representatives by Mr. Hitt. Since other
legislation along the same lines has been proposed to Congress and the
subject is still under discussion, no final action having been taken, it
is not desired to say more here than that the Institution, through the
Bureau of American Ethnology, is deeply interested in the proposed

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 31

plan for preserving the antiquities of our country and awaits the com-
mands of Congress in the matter.

I have continued to take much interest in the preparation of the
Dictionary of Indian Tribes, not only for its value as a scientific
memoir, but especially for its hoped-for utility in bringing before
Congress the past, present, and future work of the Bureau. I stated
in my last year’s report that the work contemplates the publication of
two octavo volumes, embodying in compact form information gath-
ered by the Bureau during the past years regarding American races,
the first of which volumes, it was then believed, would be ready for
the press at the close of the year. The distribution of this important
work has been delayed beyond the time anticipated, owing to the desire
of those engaged in it to have it represent the latest views of ethnolo-
gists on the subjects treated, as well as a history of the past work of
the Bureau, and to the fact that the means at disposal have not per-
mitted that provision of skilled assistants which would have enabled
the work to be completed at the time at first confidently expected. It
is now believed that the first volume of the dictionary will be ready
for the printer before the appearance of the present report, though it
may yet be some time before it is received from the press, owing to
the time actually required for the printing of the volume.

The printing of the annual reports and bulletins, including various
scientific papers, is progressing favorably, and matter for the Twenty-
fourth Annual volume, that for 1904, is practically ready for the press.

It is believed that important results would be derived from a study
of the languages, manners, and customs of the natives of Hawaii and
Tutuila, and Congress has been asked to approve the extension of the
activities of the Bureau to these islands.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

The International Exchange Service has for many years been the
medium of exchanging the official publications of the United States
Government with those of foreign countries and a like interchange of
the publications of the Smithsonian Institution and of the principal
scientific societies of this country with those of scientific bodies
throughout the world. A new exchange list of foreign institutions
was published during the year numbering 12,720 addresses, an increase
of 3,306 addresses of such institutions since the publication of the last
list in 1897. The total number of foreign and domestic correspond-
ents is now 48,072, an increase of 4,060 correspondents during the past
year. Of this number 16,721 are classed as institutions and 31,351 as
individuals, the United States patrons of the service including 3,464
institutions and 6,450 individuals. The operations of the service dur-
ing the last fiscal year show a gain of 8,766 in the number of packages
ag REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

handled, the total for the year being 158,983, having an aggregate
weight of 481,410 pounds.

The chief clerk of the service, Mr. W. Irving Adams, visited
Europe during the year and was successful in promoting a more gen-
eral interest in the interchange of books with several countries, as
well as inaugurating many improvements in the prompt transmission
of packages.

Dr. Carl Felix Alfred Fliigel, who had served as agent of the Insti-
tution at Leipzig for forty-nine years, died on February 6, 1904, and
was succeeded by Mr. Karl W. Hiersemann, of the same city.

Some progress has been made toward the reestablishment of exchange
relations with China, and in general the condition of the ‘* Exchanges”
is one to cause satisfaction to those who are laboring for its advance.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

Under the care of the Regents the National Zoological Park con-
tinues to fulfill the objects of Congress in its foundation so effectively
that perhaps no department of the Government service gives such
widespread benefit in health and pleasure to the inhabitants of the
District. As a consequence the number of visitors constantly con-
tinues to increase, there having been considerably more than a million
during the past year.

The number of animals exhibited and maintained in the park has
gradually augmented year by year, the net increase during the past
season amounting to more than 10 per cent of the total on hand at the
beginning of that period. This has necessarily occasioned a crowding,
which is not conducive to the welfare of the animals. In order to
relieve this in some degree, it was decided to build a new house which
should serve as quarters for some of the more important ones and in
which they would be under more wholesome conditions of tempera-
ture. This house will be a substantial stone structure, not unduly
conspicuous, but harmonizing with the group in which it stands. At
the present time only the walls of this building are completed. The
cost of construction will be defrayed from the general appropriation
for the park, which necessarily prevents any considerable expenditure
of funds for other objects than the maintenance and care of the collec-
tion. A plan of the building is given in the superimtendent’s report
(Appendix IV).

I have in previous reports during the past ten years urged the
desirability—even the imperative necessity—of provision for the pres-
ervation of our vanishing races of animals, if they were to be saved
from extinction. Repeated experience has demonstrated the fact that
some of the largest of our native herbivorous animals will not thrive
when closely confined. Even the American bison, it appears, can not
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 33

long be successfully bred except where given extended range. Herds
kept on restricted areas may do well for a time, but eventually their
vitality becomes impaired, the birth rate diminishes, and it is only by
the addition of new animals bred in comparative freedom that the con
tinued propagation of the species under such conditions can be secured.
The recommendations made to Congress in previous years for the
establishment of preserves and other measures to insure the continued
existence of some of these notable animals have not secured favorable
action. I fear that already this matter is passing beyond control, for
no power can recall a vanished race.

The varied topography of the park, presenting as it does a succes-
sion of valleys and hillsides of unusual beauty, makes it eminently
adapted to such treatment as would protect indigenous flowers and
trees and maintain them in the best conditions attainable. What is
known to landscape gardeners as a ** wild garden”—that is to say, a plan-
tation of indigenous plants allowed to grow with freedom, yet arranged
so as to produce unobtrusive artistic effects—can be applied to many
portions of the park with excellent results. Something of this kind
will probably be attempted on a small scale should the appropriation
permit. All such attempts, however, should and will be made subor-
dinate to the prime object of the park, namely, that of maintaining a
zoological collection.

The policy of encouraging wild animals and birds to make the park
their home has been increasingly followed, and were it practicable to
employ sufficient force to thoroughly police the park and its entrances,
herds of Virgina deer and perhaps of the American antelope might be
allowed to run free within it. The principal difficulty experienced in
caring for animals and birds thus running wild lies in their tendency
to stray away and get into the more extensive woods in the Rock
Creek Park or its neighborhood, where they are often killed. It
would be an advantage if the killing of game animals could be abso-
lutely prohibited in the District of Columbia, for if such prohibition
were made it would be possible within a few years to have a consider-
able collection of animals and birds living in perfectly natural condi-
tions and with but little fear of man. I shall gladly aid in procuring
any legislation to this end.

In order to bring to the notice of the general public the aims and
objects of the National Zoological Park, it was thought desirable to
make at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition a more significant exhibit
than has heretofore been shown. Accordingly application was made
fora large ‘‘flying-cage” in which to exhibit birds in conditions as nearly
natural as possible. The United States Government Board considered
the matter favorably, and an exhibit of this character was accordingly
installed, and at the close of the year was in successful operation. I

sm 1904——3

34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

have been pleased to learn that no part of the Government exhibits has
excited more popular interest there.

Congress at its last session took up the important question of the
definitive arrangement of streets in the vicinity of the Zoological Park,
and established, by law, two such thoroughfares, one on the south-
eastern, the other on the western side of the park. Two comparatively
narrow strips are thus left between these roads and the park boundary,
and it would be of great advantage if these strips could be added to
the park. Attention has been called to this matter in previous reports,
and I have again submitted to Congress an estimate of the sum required
to effect the necessary purchase.

I can, in conclusion, repeat my statement that the park is fulfilling
more amply than ever the objects for which Congress founded it,
‘‘the advancement of science and the instruction and recreation of the
people.”

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

In my last year’s report I stated that it was probable that the radia-
tion of the sun after absorption by the earth’s atmosphere as received
at Washington, appeared to have fallen off by 10 per cent, and I added
that there had possibly been a decrease of the solar radiation itself
since the early part of the year 1903. I observed in this connection
that there seemed renewed promise of progress toward the foretelling
by such means of the remoter changes of weather which affect harvests,
which was one of the great aims had in view in the foundation of the
observatory.

With the aid of the large horizontal telescope and the apparatus
for obtaining distinet vision introduced by me and described in my
last report, and more fully in that for the present year, I have con-
tinued these investigations, particularly with reference to the increase
or diminution of the original solar radiation, apart from that absorbed
by the earth’s atmosphere, and by means which are unaffected by that
absorption. These observations, independent of any theory upon the
subject, indicated that at the time of the observation in the last report
this radiation fell off at the source of energy in the sun, and that
changes in the transmissibility of the solar atmosphere were a possible
cause of at least a part of the effect observed on the earth. The amount
by which this solar radiation was diminished, as determined at the
source in the sun itself, appears to be in general accord with the state-
ments of meteorological observatories as to the changed temperature
at the earth’s surface. I do not, however, venture to make the state-
ment that the diminution was unquestionably due to a change in the
solar envelope as an established fact, until further observations have
been made, while I still call attention to the high importance of addi-
tional study of the question.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

NECROLOGY.
DR. CARL ALFRED FELIX FLUGEL.

In the death of Doctor Fliigel, which occurred in Leipzig, February
6, 1904, the Smithsonian Institution lost a loyal assistant and an intel-
ligent and capable representative. Doctor Fliigel was appointed agent
of the International Exchange Service of the Institution for Germany,
Austria, and the adjacent countries in 1855, a position he filled for the
remaining nearly fifty years of his life. He was the official successor
of his father, Dr. Johann Gottfried Fliigel, who was made agent of
the Smithsonian Exchange Service, at the time of its organization in
1847, by Prof. Joseph Henry, first Secretary of the Institution, he also
having filled the position until his death in 1854. The son succeeded
his father as United States vice-consul in Leipzig also, this position
under the Government proving likewise a life appointment in the case
of both father and son.

Dr. Felix Fliigel was scholarly in his tastes and occupations by both
inheritance and training, the father having been the first lecturer in
English in the University of Leipzig, where he received his doctor’s
degree in 1824, publishing in the same year a Grammar of the English
Language, which remains a noteworthy record of the earlier period of
English philology in Germany. Both father and son were persever-
ing and laborious students in English, each publishing pamphlets and
critical essays on the language, and each being the author of an English
and German dictionary, that of the son having become a standard
work, which reached its fifteenth edition in 1891.

The long tenure of office of Dr. Felix Fliigel gave him an excep-
tional opportunity to further the exchange work of the Smithsonian
Institution throughout central Europe, and believing that the system
was an important medium of scientific intercourse between the United
States and Europe, he labored untiringly for its development along
practical lines, at the same time adding to exact business methods the
charm of a personal courtesy and kindness which won many friends.

It would be difficult to overestimate the intelligent and faithful serv-”
ice rendered to the Institution for so many years by Doctor Fliigel,
and the appreciation of his character expressed by those officials whose
fortune it was to know him personally is a sincere tribute to his
capability and worth.

DR. HENRY CARRINGTON BOLTON.

Doctor Bolton, who died on November 19, 1903, was an earnest worker
in the field of chemical bibliography. He unselfishly devoted many
years of patient personal toil to the preparation of reference books
of much value to all interested in the study of chemistry. He also
36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

compiled a catalogue of scientific periodicals of the world. Many of
the results of his labors were by him freely presented to the Smith-
sonian Institution and were published in the series of Miscellaneous
Collections.

Doctor Bolton was born in New York City January 28, 1843. He
graduated from Columbia College in 1862, and during the next four
years studied at Heidelberg and Berlin, in 1866 receiving the degree
of Ph. D. at Géttingen. In 1875 he was assistant in the laboratory
of the Columbia School of Mines, in 1875 professor of chemistry at
the Woman’s College of the New York Infirmary, from 1877 to 1887
professor of chemistry at Trinity College, Hartford, Conn., when he
retired from teaching and devoted the remaining years of his life
chiefly to literary pursuits and to travel. For several years his winter
home was in Washington City. He was a member of the New York
Academy of Science (its president in 1893), of the American Associa-
tion for the Advancement of Science, and one of the founders of the
American Folk Lore Society. In 1897 he was president of the Library
Association of Washington City; was president of the American
Chemical Society in 1900, and was also a member of many other
learned bodies in Europe and the United States, being a frequent
contributor to their literary exercises and published transactions.

His varied contributions to contemporary literature cover more
than 200 titles, among which may be mentioned The Scientific Corre-
spondence of Joseph Priestley; Counting-Out Rhymes of Children;
Catalogue of Scientific and Technical Periodicals, 1665-1897, and
Select Bibliography of Chemistry, 1492-1902.

Respectfully submitted.

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX TO THE SECRETARY'S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.
REPORT ON THE UNITED STATES NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report upon the condition and oper-
ations of the National Museum during the year ending June 30, 1904.

Ground was broken on June 15, 1904, for the new Museum building authorized by
Congress in 1903, the first sod being turned by the Secretary of the Smithsonian
Institution in the presence of the architects, the superintendent of construction, and
the officers and employees of the Institution and its Bureaus. The excavation for
the foundation and basement was well under way at the close of the fiscal year, and
it is hoped that nothing will arise to interfere with the speedy construction of the
building. This additional home for the National Collections will be about 551
feet long and 318 feet wide, exclusive of projections, thus exceeding in these dimen-
sions all other buildings in the city of Washington except the Capitol. Its faces will
be of light-colored granite, and its four stories will afford a floor area of about 93
acres.

It is gratifying to be able to state that notwithstanding the great pressure of work
in the scientific departments, caused by the preparation of exhibits for the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition, very satisfactory progress has been made in all of the operations
of the Museum.

The number of accessions received during the year was 1,703, or 60 more than in
1903, and comprise a total of 241,547 specimens. Profitable exchanges have been
made with other institutions and with private collectors, the number of duplicate
specimens utilized for this purpose exceeding 9,000,

The number of publications issued has been somewhat larger than usual, and their
distribution, together with a large increase in the extent of the correspondence, has
taxed to the utmost the office charged with these matters.

The reserve or study collections have been extensively used by investigators and
students both in Washington and elsewhere, and more than 20,000 specimens have
been sent to specialists for examination and report. The number of lots of speci-
mens received for identification has been 975.

Buildings.—The roofs on the Museum building, and especially those covered with
slate, have fora long period been in a very unsatisfactory condition, resulting mainly
from the fact that they were constructed too cheaply in the beginning, and there-
fore not as substantially as they should have been. Through the contraction and
expansion of the iron supports by changes in temperature, the slate coverings have
never been kept tight, and in other parts there has been greater or less trouble in
regard to leakage, which has caused a constant defacement of the inner walls and
some injury to the contents of the building. It is now realized that the only proper
remedy would be to substitute a new roof for the present one, but as this can not be
done at present, an effort is being made to institute more substantial repairs than
heretofore, though at the best they can only be considered as temporary. The tin

coverings, gutters, ete., do not present serious difficulties, though requiring exten-
sive renovation. Experiments on the slate, however, have led to the trial of a coy-
ering of asphalt, burlap, and slag, which has thus far resulted so favorably that it is
now proposed to treat all the slate roofs in this manner.

The arch:eological exhibition hall, the large upper room in the Smithsonian build-
ing, which has been closed for some time on account of the extensive loosening and
fall of plaster, has been entirely repaired and painted during the past year, but its
opening to the public must be deferred for a while longer, or until its collections
have been reinstalled. Many other repairs in both buildings have been made during
the year, but they have been chiefly of a minor character.

The number of specimen cases constructed has amounted to 212, and of specimen
drawers to 3,378, mainly to accommodate the extensive accessions of the year, derived
in greater part from Government scientific surveys. The fittings of all kinds for the
cases and for the mounting of specimens have called for a large amount of labor and
material.

The pair of high-pressure steam boilers installed in the summer of 1901 for the
heating of the two main buildings and the smaller adjacent buildings has continued
to give entire satisfaction. The efficiency of the fire-protective system has been
thoroughly tested during the year, with the result that some of the extinguishers of
old pattern have been replaced by others of more modern make.

Organization and staf’.—A few changes in the organization of the Museum have
been made as follows:

The title of the ‘‘ Division of Religions’’ has been changed to ‘‘ Division of Historic
Religions,’ with Dr. Cyrus Adler as honorary curator, and the former ‘“Section of
Historic Religious Ceremonials’’ has been abolished. That of the ‘‘ Division of His-
tory and Biography’? has been changed to ‘‘Division of History,’? with Mr. A.
Howard Clark as honorary curator and Mr. Paul E. Beckwith as assistant curator,
the “Section of American History’? being omitted. The ‘Section of Electricity”
has been abolished.

Mr. William H. Holmes, formerly head curator of the Department of Anthropology,
but now Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology, has accepted the position of
honorary curator of the Division of Prehistoric Archeology, and Mr. J. D. McGuire
that of collaborator in the same division. Other appointments have been as follows:
Dr. Edward L. Greene, formerly professor of botany in the Catholic University of
America, as associate in botany; Mr. Paul Brockett as custodian of the Section of
Graphic Arts; Mr. Walter L. Hahn as aid in the Division of Mammals, and Mr. J. S.
Goldsmith as superintendent of construction and labor, being a part of the service
performed by the late Dr. J. E. Watkins, whose lamented death occurred on August
11, 1903.

A number of members of the scientific staff have severed their connection with the
Museum, all at their own volition, to accept positions at higher compensation else-
where. Among these were Mr. F. A. Lucas, curator of Comparative Anatomy, who
has become curator in chief of the museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and
Sciences; Mr. Louis Pollard, assistant curator in the Division of Plants; Mr. Rolla P.
Currie, aid in the Division of Insects; and Mr. W. C. Phalen, aid, and Mr. R. 8. Bassler
and Mr. Alvan Stewart, preparators, in the Department of Geology.

It may also be mentioned in this connection that Mr. Charles Schuchert, assistant
curator of Stratigraphic Paleontology, attended the Ninth International Geological
Congress, held at Vienna from August 20 to 27, 1903, as the representative of the
Smithsonian Institution and the Museum; while in the same capacity Mr. Leonhard
Stejneger, curator of Reptiles, Mr. Gerrit 8. Miller, jr., assistant curator of Mammals,
and Dr. ©. W. Stiles, custodian of Helminthological Collections, will be present at
the Sixth International Congress of Zoology at Berne during August of this year,
and Mr. William H. Holmes at the Congress of Americanists to be held at Stuttgart
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 39

during the same month. Messrs. Stejneger, Miller, Stiles, and Holmes have also been
designated by the Department of State as official representatives of the Government
on the two occasions named.

Additions to the collections. —The number of separate lots of material received during
the year was 1,703, comprising 241,547 specimens in all, or 5,000 more than the pre-
vious year. The total number of specimens recorded in all departments of the Museum
is now 5,894,620 specimens, of which more than 4,100,000 belong to the Department
of Biology, nearly 975,000 to the Department of Anthropology, and about 730,000 to
the Department of Geology.

Collections sent by Dr. W. L. Abbott from the Malay peninsula, northern Sumatra,
and the adjacent archipelago contain the most interesting additions in Anthropology,
and in conjunction with his previous contributions from the same and other parts of
Asia constitute an exceedingly valuable and unique feature of the ethnological
exhibits. Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. 8. Army, who has continued his scientific work in
the Philippine Islands, presented collections of special interest obtained by himself
during the campaign against the Moros. Another Moro collection, consisting of
edged weapons, spears, and costumes, was received from Dr. R. B. Grubb, also of
the United States Army. The very valuable collection of archeological objects
obtained in Cuba, Trinidad, Grenada, Barbados, Dominica, Porto Rico, and other
West Indian islands by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, of the Bureau of American Ethnology,
during the winter of 1903, has been transferred to the keeping of the Museum. It
contains a very large variety of objects which will probably aid materially in solving
the problem of the ancient relations between North and South America. The same
Bureau has also deposited a large series of specimens recently taken from caverns,
rock shelters, and village sites in the Ozark region of Missouri and Arkansas. A
number of Tlinkit house posts and totem poles was obtained from Dr. George A.
Dorsey, of the Field Columbian Museum, and a valuable lot of art objects from south-
western Alaska, consisting of carved clubs, knives, embroidered blankets, etc., from
Lieut. G. T. Emmons, U. 8. Navy. Some curious earthenware vessels from aboriginal
graves in Argentina were presented by Mr. Felix F. Outes, of Buenos Aires, and
several knives with handles and blades in one piece, as well as flint implements,
from the temple of Osiris, Abydos, were contributed by the Egypt exploration fund.

The collections in prehistoric archeology have been enriched by a series of Egyptian
stone implements presented by Mr. H. W. Seton-Karr, of England, and representing
a type peculiar to the Fayum district, as well as by a large series of specimens chiefly
from a few localities in the Miami Valley, and forming part of the bequest of the
late I. H. Harris, of Waynesville, Ohio. The latter contribution also includes a
typical series of earthenware vessels from mounds near Charleston, Mo.

To the recently established Division of Physical Anthropology have been added
more than 2,000 crania and skeletons by transfer from the Army Medical Museum,
11 crania of Wasco Indians from the Fred Harvey collection, and other desirable
specimens.

The additions to the historical collections have included a valuable series of relies
presented hy Gen. John Watts de Peyster, who has also made several contributions
of important historical works; the gilt dress sword presented to Gen. Jacob Brown,
by the State of New York, for valuable services during the Revolutionary war,
donated by his grandson, Mr. Nathan Brown Chase; an oil portrait of George Catlin,
‘painted by W. H. Fisk, R. A., in 1849, deposited by his daughter, Mrs. Louise
Catlin Kinney; numerous relics deposited by the National Society of the Daughters
of the American Revolution, and the sword and epaulettes worn by Gen. Alex.
McComb, U. 8. Army.

The technological exhibits have been materially increased; among the accessions
of special interest being a collection of rifles, muskets, and other firearms of his-
* torical value, 615 in number, deposited by the Bureau of Ordnance of the War
40) REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Department; a collection of Morse telegraph keys, insulators, and other electrical
apparatus, presented by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company; a collection illustrat-
ing the development of the hand camera, by the Eastman Kodak Company; a
collection of sporting rifles of the kind used in this country prior to 1850, lent by
Mr. Herman Hollerith, and a rare form of flintlock pistol with folding bayonet,
presented by Mr. Paul Beckwith.

The accessions to the Departme: t of Biology embraced 151,000 specimens, or nearly
41,000 more than the previous year. The collection of insects was increased by
about 59,000 specimens, the herbarium by about 43,000, while the remaining 49,000
specimens were divided among the other divisions.

The most extensive of the zoological collections, in point of number of specimens,
consisted of about 40,000 insects obtained in British Columbia by Dr. Harrison G.
Dyar, assisted by Mr. Rolla P. Currie and Mr. A. N. Caudell. The Bureau of Fish-
eries transmitted large collections of land and fresh-water shells, reptiles, and crus-
taceans from Indiana and other States; a valuable series of marine mollusks, chiefly
from Alaska; the types of recently described fishes from Japan, the Hawaiian
Islands, ete.; fishes, crustaceans, and corals secured in connection with the Alaskan
salmon-fisheries investigation of 1903, and 461 plants from Alaska and Oregon.

Especially worthy of mention are the important zoological contributions from the
Mentawei Archipelago, Sumatra, and various islands off the eastern coast of Sumatra,
obtained and presented by Dr. William L. Abbott. Thirty-one new forms of mam-
mals and several new species of birds are represented in the collection from the
archipelago, while those from eastern Sumatra also contain very valuable material,
including numerous forms of birds and reptiles not previously received. Several
valuable lots of zoological specimens from Minnesota and the Philippine Islands
were donated by Dr. E. A. Mearns, U.S. Army. <A large number of mammals,
birds, reptiles, and fishes from the Bahama Islands were secured as the result of the
expedition sent to those islands by the Baltimore Geographical Society, and of
which Mr. B. A. Bean and Mr. J. H. Riley, of the Museum staff, were members.
A valuable collection of birds’ eggs and reptiles from Texas was transmitted by the
Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture.

Noteworthy among the mammals received were a specimen of a remarkable species
of bat, Euderma maculatum, presented by Mr. E. O. Wooton, of Mesilla Park, N. Mex.;
the first authentic specimen of a jaguar from the United States; a rare mouse-deer,
Tragulus stanleyanus, obtained from M. Emile Deschamps; a collection of Old World
mammals, obtained from W. Schliiter; a collection of Japanese mammals from
Mr. T. Tsuchida; some rare forms of bats from the British Museum, and a collection
of Colombian mammals from the American Museum of Natural History.

An interesting series of birds of the Philippine Islands was secured by exchange
with the Museum in Manila. Mr. Homer Davenport, of East Orange, N. J., pre-
sented a number of young pheasants, and Mr. N. C. Brown, of Portland, Me., a well-
prepared series of the birds of North Carolina. Four species of birds of paradise,
new to the collection, were purchased. Dr. W. L. Ralph, of the Museum staff, and
Gen. J. W. Barlow made generous contributions to the collection of birds’ eggs, and
series of rare Mexican eggs and of the eggs of the Hoactzin were purchased.

A collection of Japanese reptiles was presented by Dr. Hugh M. Smith, and some
rare reptiles of southern Florida by Mr. E. J. Brown, of Lemon City, Fla. The
Division of Fishes has received a large number of Japanese species from the Leland
Stanford Junior University, and a well-prepared series of specimens from Puget
Sound, donated by Dr. J. C. Thompson, U. 8. Navy. A specimen of the Japanese
shark, Mitsukuria owstoni, was purchased.

Hawaiian land shells and other invertebrates were received from Mr. H. W. Hen-
shaw, of Hilo, Hawaii; Dr. R. E. C. Stearns, honorary associate in zoology, now
residing in Los Angeles, Cal., presented an extensive series of west American shells,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 41

and Mr. H. N. Lowe and Mrs. Blanche Trask, several lots of Californian shells; Mr.
E. J. Court, of Washington, D. C., donated a representative series of the land shells
of Maryland, Virginia, and the District of Columbia; Dr. Dwight Blaney about 300
shells dredged near Mount Desert, Me., and Mr. C. A. Davis, many Bermuda shells,
including several cotypes. Among the specimens obtained by purchase was a large
collection of Japanese land and marine mollusks, and land shells from the Pacific
coast and the islands off California.

The Division of Marine Invertebrates received a collection of Mexican fresh-water
crabs from the Biological Survey of the Department of Agriculture; crustaceans from
Catalina and San Clemente Islands, presented by Mr. H. N. Lowe; cotypes of a
species of shrimp and of a stomatopod crustacean from the National Museum of
Brazil; several beautiful specimens of the Japanese precious coral from Dr. K.
Kishinouye; and a collection of sea urchins, chiefly from the Gulf of Siam, from the
Zoological Museum in Copenhagen.

The additions to the Division of Insects were numerous and valuable. Among
those of greatest importance may be noted two lots of over 6,000 specimens from the
Department of Agriculture; an extensive collection of Coleoptera, Lepidoptera, ete.,
made by Mr. E. A. Schwarz, in Texas; several lots of Philippine insects from Rey.
W. A. Stanton, of Manila, and one from Mr. R. C. McGregor, of the Philippine
Museum; a large miscellaneous collection from the grounds of the Washington Biol-
ogists’s Field Club at Plummer’s Island; and a valuable collection of Lepidoptera,
from Mr. E. M. Anderson, of the Provincial Museum at Victoria, British Columbia.
From foreign sources the following collections were received as gifts: Indian Hymen-
optera from Maj. C. G. Nurse; Indian spiders from Prof. N. Jambunathan; Venezu-
elan beetles from Mr. Edward A. Klages; Peruvian insects from Mr. M. J. Pusey;
and Norwegian Lepidoptera from Sir George Hampson, of the British Museum.

Of 555 accessions to the Division of Plants, the most valuable was the deposit made
by Dr. E. L. Greene, of his collection of about 60,000 sheets of plants, and his entire
botanical library. Next in importance was the gift by Mrs. T. A. Williams, of Mem-
phis, Nebr., of about 15,000 plants from various parts of the United States. Mr. C.
V. Piper, of Pullman, Wash., presented more than 600 plants from that State, and
Mr. E. W. D. Holway, of Minneapolis, Minn., an interesting collection of Mexican
plants. Important exchanges were made with the Philippine Bureau of Agriculture,
the New York Botanical Garden, and the Royal Gardens at Kew, England. Sixty-
eight botanical accessions were received from the Department of Agriculture, the
most important comprising specimens obtained in Texas by Mr. Arthur Howell,
in New Mexico and Oklahoma by Mr. Fred. G. Plummer, and in New Mexico by
Mr. Vernon Bailey. Plants from Australia, Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, and
from several of the States were acquired by purchase.

The most extensive additions to the geological collections were, as usual, received
from the United States Geological Survey, prominent among them having been about
40,000 invertebrate fossils, mostly named and including a large amount of material
on which Dr. William H. Dalland his assistants have been working for several years.
The Survey also transmitted a series of 1,932 tertiary insects, assembled by Dr. Samuel
H. Scudder, together with a number of original drawings. The acquisition of this
material is believed to make the Museum collection of fossil insects the largest in the
United States, if not in the world.

A collection of platiniferous rocks from the Demidoff mines in Russia was pre-
sented by Juarez Sponyille; a series of rocks illustrating the occurrence and associa-
tion of diamonds at the De Beers consolidated mines in South Africa, by Mr. Gardner
F. Williams, manager of the mines; a rich nugget of native silver, by A. L. Pellegrin,
of Nogales, Ariz., and a specimen of diamond-bearing gravel from Minas Geraes,
Brazil, to which a small diamond was attached, by Dr. O, A. Derby, of Sao Paulo.
49 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

A fine mass of amethystine quartz, weighing about 400 pounds, was obtained from
Ward’s Natural Science Establishment, Rochester, N. Y.

The Division of Minerals was enriched by a large collection illustrating the occur-
rence and association of the zeolites and siliceous minerals of New Jersey, obtained
through the assistance of Dr. W. S. Disbrow, of Newark, N. J., who also transmitted
one of the first known crystals of American spodumene. Other important gifts were
a specimen of pink spodumene, from Mr. F. M. Sickler; a series of artificial stones
used in the gem trade, from Mr. Oscar T. Jonassohn; a cut turquoise from North
Carolina, from Mr. Eugene A. Smith, and some fine specimens of smoky quartz from
Messrs. A. P. Pohndorf and J. R. Wharton.

For the meteorite collection specimens illustrating the Trenzano fall, the France-
ville iron, the Mukerop iron, and the Finnmarken pallasite have been acquired.

Of invertebrate fossils, the accession next in importance to that transferred by the
United States Geological Survey was the last portion of the E. O. Ulrich collection,
containing about 15,000 specimens, besides 500 lots of original types or of specimens
that have been used for illustration. A series of Lower Silurian fossils, selected by
Mr. Charles Schuchert while in Russia, was presented by the Imperial Academy of
Sciences, of St. Petersburg, through the cooperation of Dr. Frederich von Schmidt,
and a valuable donation consisting of nearly 600 specimens of Hamilton brachiopods
was received from the Yale University Museum. By exchange with the Zoological
Museum of the University of Copenhagen, more than a hundred specimens of
identified European mesozoic and tertiary bryozoans were obtained.

-To the collection of fossil vertebrates were added fine specimens of pterodactyl,
ichthyosaurus, and teleosaurus; some fishes from the lithographic limestone, and a
fossil skull of Bison Alleni from a placer deposit of frozen gravel, 25 feet below the
surface: The object last mentioned was presented by Messrs. McLain and Ballou, of
Rampart City, Alaska, and is especially noteworthy as being the first specimen of the
species discovered in Alaska.

One hundred and thirty-two fossil plants collected in the Iowa anthracite beds
were donated by Mr. C. W. Unger, of Pottsville, Pa., and 190 specimens of fossil
plants from Illinois, Ohio, and other localities, forming part of the Carl Rominger
collection, were also obtained.

Explorations.—But few explorations were carried on last year by members of the
Museum staff, owing to the lack of funds. Dr. Walter Hough spent some time in
Arizona and New Mexico, where he made a large collection of ethnological and
archeological objects. The expedition sent to the Bahamas during the summer of
1903 by the Baltimore Geographical Society and Johns Hopkins University, under
the direction of Dr. G. B. Shattuck, was accompanied by Mr. Barton A. Bean and
Mr. J. H. Riley, who took an active part in the work of collecting and observation.
Dr. Harrison G. Dyar and Mr. Rolla P. Currie were members of a party sent to
British Columbia by the Carnegie Museum of Pittsburg. During a trip to Europe Mr.
Charles Schuchert collected some valuable fossils, and while seeking material for the
Louisiana Purchase Exposition Dr. George P. Merrill obtained many geological
specimens for the Museum on the Pacific coast and in Canada and western Mexico.

Having been designated by the State Department and the Smithsonian Institution
as delegates to the International Congress of Zoology at Berne, Switzerland, during
the summer of 1904, Dr. Leonhard Stejneger and Mr. Gerrit S. Miller, jr., left Wash-
ington in May with the object also of making collections of mammals and reptiles in
Europe, and of studying the specimens of these groups in the principal European
museums. Short collecting trips, not necessary to mention here, were also made by
other members of the staff.

There have been many explorations through which the Museum has profited, by
private individuals and by other Government bureaus, of which a few may be noted.
Dr. William L. Abbot has continued his field work in Sumatra, the Mentawei Archi-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

pelago, and along the coast and on the islands east of Sumatra. In connection with
the investigations of the Bureau of Fisheries, Dr. Hugh M. Smith has visited Japan,
and Dr. B. W. Evermann, Prof. Charles H. Gilbert, and Prof. O. P. Jenkins have
made extensive explorations in Hawaii. The natural history bureaus of the Depart-
ment of Agriculture, and especially the Biological Survey, have made important col-
lections in different parts of the United States.

Field work under the Bureau of American Ethnology, productive of collections,
has been carried on by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, in the West Indies, and by Mr. James
Mooney, Mr. Gerard Fowke, Mrs. M. C. Stevenson, and Mr. J. R. Swanton, in the
West. Reference should also be made to the important work conducted in the Phil-
ippine Islands by Dr. E. A. Mearns, U. 8. Army, one of the most frequent contribu-
tors to the Museum collections.

Researches. —Of the material which reaches the Museum, a part has previously been
studied and a part not, but the proportion either way would be difficult to state and
varies from year to year. The act founding the establishment provides that the
collections shall be arranged and classified, and therefore in selecting the caretakers,
persons skilled in the various branches represented are chosen to the extent of the
funds available. It is recognized that their first obligation is to look out for the
safety of the specimens in their charge, and as the technical staff under pay is rela-
tively small, attention to this duty consumes the greater part of their time. About
one-half of the scientific staff, moreover, consists of volunteers, on whom the same
demands can not be made, though some of these are equally attentive to the routine
work. The scientific results accomplished each year by the Museum staff as a whole
is, nevertheless, relatively extensive, comprising mainly the identification, labeling
and description of specimens, and their classified arrangement in cases and drawers,
so as to make them convenient for reference.

For a large part of the scientific work, however, assistance must be obtained from
experts connected with other establishments. Entire groups of specimens may be
assigned to individuals for working up, or advantage may be taken of researches in
progress elsewhere to have material of greater or less extent identified, and visiting
scientific men are often willing to spend some time upon such parts of the collections
as come within their knowledge. It is impossible within the limits of this report to
account for all the work of this character carried on during the past year, but the
number of persons concerned, not including those on the Museum staff, was in the
neighborhood of 200, and over 20,000 specimens were sent away for study. The coop-
eration with persons living elsewhere is far greatest in connection with the Depart-
ment of Biology, whose varied collections have long attracted widespread interest,
and have led to many extensive and important investigations.

Exchanges.—Many exchanges of duplicate specimens with other institutions and
with individuals have been made with satisfactory results for the Museum. The
establishments abroad with which such transactions were most extensively carried
on were the Albany Museum at Grahamstown, South Africa; the K. K. Naturhis-
torisches Hofmuseum at Vienna; the Zoological Institute of the Imperial University
at Vienna; the Botanical Museum at Berlin; the Museum of Natural History at
Paris; the Zoological Museum of the University of Copenhagen; the Royal Frederick
University of Christiania, and the Royal Botanic Garden at Sibpur, Calcutta.

The distribution of duplicates to colleges and other educational institutions through-
out the country has been limited during the year to fishes, marine invertebrates, and
geological specimens illustrating rock weathering and soil formation, of which 97 sets
have been sent out. Some duplicate sets of fossils are now being prepared for the
same purpose. The applications for such material to aid in the teaching of natural
- history are far more numerous than can be supplied, the assistants qualified to select
and label the specimens being generally too busily occupied in other ways. The
44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

present crowded condition of the Museum also interferes with the overhauling of the
collections, which is necessary in picking out the duplicates.

The exhibition halls.—Although no increase in the amount of exhibition space is
possible in the present building, yet by resorting to various expedients and removing
specimens to storage a little more room may be obtained here and there for the dis-
play of exhibits or single objects which it is thought may prove of greater interest to
the public.

In the Department of Anthropology a few cases have been added in the northwest
court gallery for an exhibit of Indian baskets, this subject having gained special
prominence through the publication of Prof. O. T. Mason’s recent paper. Space has
also been provided for a portion of the splendid Malaysian collection received from
Dr. William L. Abbott. A collection of lamps, a typical series of guns, and three
table-cases containing revolvers and pistols of various dates and makes have been
arranged in the east hall, and a number of ethnological objects from the Philippine
Islands in the gallery of the northwest court. The collection of musical instruments
has been partly reinstalled. Among the technological objects has been placed the
cylinder of the Hornblower engine, the first steam engine put together on the western
continent, having been imported from England in 1753.

The groups of ethnological lay figures returned from recent expositions have been
installed wherever a place could be found for them, some having been arranged in
the lecture hall.

But little was done toward preparing new exhibits in the Department of Biology,
as other and more urgent work has. interfered. Some of the more valuable birds
have been remounted, and four groups of game birds have been installed in two new
cases at the entrance to the Smithsonian building. The unoccupied cases in the
southeast range set apart for casts of fishes will soon be filled by new preparations
now in course of making. A beginning has been made toward the installation of a
series of specimens illustrating the mollusk fauna of the District of Columbia, one
case having already been completed.

To the display collection in the Department of Geology have been added the skulls
of a new genus of Ceratopsia, and of Diplodocus and Trachodon, and also a mounted
skeleton of Syornis casuarinus from New Zealand. The Claosaurus, mentioned in
last year’s report, is exhibited near the south wall of the southeast court.

Visitors. The number of persons who visited the Museum building during the
year was 220,778, and the Smithsonian building, 143,988, being an approximate daily
average of 705 for the former and of 460 for the latter. The decrease as compared
with the previous year was a result of the large attendance at the time of the encamp-
ment of the Grand Army of the Republic in October, 1902. Since the first occupa-
tion of the Museum building in 1881, the total number of visitors recorded has been
over 8,000,000.

Meetings and lectwres.—On February 20 and 27, and March 5, 12, and 19, a series of
lectures was given in the lecture hall under the auspices of the Biological Society of
Washington by Mr. Charles H. Townsend, Mr. Gifford Pinchot, Mr. E. W. Nelson,
Prof. Henry F. Osborn, and Dr. C. Hart Merriam, the average attendance having
been about 1,000. The closing exercises of the Naval Medical School and the Army
Medical School were held in the same place on March 21 and April 5, respectively.
The American Oriental Society had its annual meeting in the lecture hall on April
7 and 8, and the National Academy of Sciences from April 19 to 21. On June 13 an
illustrated lecture entitled ‘‘ Botanical Tramps with a Camera”’ was delivered by Dr.
©. E. Waters, of Johns Hopkins University, under the auspices of the Wild Flower
Preservation Society of America.

Publications.—The publications issued during the year comprised 6 volumes and 59
technical Proceedings papers, being an increase over previous years, due partly to
delays in completing volumes belonging to 1903. The 6 volumes referred to were
Nos. 25, 26, and 27 of the Proceedings, the Annual Reports for 1901 and 1902, and
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

Prof. C. C. Nutting’s monograph on the Sertularian hydroids, forming part 2 of
Special Bulletin No. 4.

The three volumes of Proceedings contained in all 110 papers, of which 39 relate
to fishes, 19 to insects, 18 to marine invertebrates, 10 to birds, and the remainder to
mammals, mollusks, plants, reptiles, fossils, and meteorites.

The Appendix to the Report for 1901 was made up of five papers, as follows:
“Report on the Exhibit of the United States National Museum at the Pan-American
Exposition, Buffalo, N. Y., 1901;”’ “ Flint Implements and Fossil Remains from a
Sulphur Spring at Afton, Ind. T.,’’ and “Classification and Arrangement of the
Exhibits of an Anthropological Museum,” by Mr. William H. Holmes; ‘Archeolog-
ical Field Work in Northeastern Arizona,’ by Dr. Walter Hough, and “ Narrative
of a Visit to Indian Tribes of the Purus River, Brazil,’’ by Prof. J. B. Steere.

The Report for 1902 contained an elaborate paper by Prof. O. T. Mason on “Abo-
riginal American Basketry: Studies in a Textile Art without Machinery’; one by
Dr. Leonhard Stejneger, entitled ‘The Herpetology of Porto Rico’; and one by Mr.
F. V. Coville, entitled ‘‘ Wokas—Primitive Food of the Klamath Indians.”

Several papers by members of the Museum staff on material contained in the
Museum were, by permission of the Secretary, printed in various journals, and a
number were also published in the quarterly issue of the Miscellaneous Collections
of the Smithsonian Institution.

The Annual Report for 1903, now ready to go to press, will have a paper by the
Assistant Secretary on the buildings occupied by the National Collections, and a
translation of the three papers by Dr. A. B. Meyer, director of the Royal Zoological
Anthropological-Ethnographical museums in Dresden, on the principal museums of
New York State, Chicago, and several European countries.

Library.—The library of the National Museum has received as a gift from Prof.
Otis T. Mason, in addition to one made some years ago, about 2,000 pamphlets, sepa-
rates, and bound quarto volumes mostly on anthropological subjects, for which a
special bookplate has been provided. The Museum has also received from Dr.
Edward L. Greene his entire botanical library, which has been placed on deposit
for a period of ten years in connection with his botanical collections.

The aggregate of additions to the Museum library for the year amounted to 1,504
books, 3,187 pamphlets, and 700 parts of volumes.

Expositions.—The exhibits prepared by the Museum for the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition were properly arranged before the opening day, and the zeal and activity
displayed by the curators, preparators and others engaged in their preparation,
shipment, and installation are highly commendable. The collections are grouped
under the three general heads of anthropology, biology, and geology. A_ brief
account of them will be found in the Museum report for this year, while the official
report of Dr. F. W. True, representative of the Institution and the National Museum,
will be published later.

Congress at its last session made provision for the celebration of the one hundredth
anniversary of the exploration of the Oregon region by Capts. Meriwether Lewis
and William Clark, including a Government exhibit, for which the sum of $200,000
was appropriated, besides $250,000 for a suitable building. The bill S. 276, intro-
duced by Senator John H. Mitchell on November 11, 1903, was approved by the
President on April 13, 1904.

Respectfully submitted.

REPORT ON THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the operations of the
Bureau of American Ethnology for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1904, conducted
in accordance with the act of Congress making provisions for continuing researches
relating to the American Indians under the direction of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion. The work has been carried out, with some minor modifications, in accordance
with plans of operations submitted, the first on June 11 and the second on Septem-
ber 26, and duly approved by the Secretary. The first plan provided for the month
of July only. The Smithsonian Institution was engaged in an examination into the
affairs of the Bureau, and until this was brought to a conclusion it was not regarded
as feasible to formulate plans for the year. The plan for July was extended to the
months of August and September, and on the Ist of October a plan of operations for
the remaining nine months of the year was submitted and duly approved by the
Secretary.

On July 31 Mr. W J McGee, ethnologist in charge, tendered his resignation, which
was accepted, and the position of ethnologist in charge was discontinued.

The research work has been carried forward by a permanent force of eight
scientific employees, and a number of temporary assistants have been engaged for
periods of varying lengths, both in the office and among the tribes. Field operations
were interfered with to some extent during the early months of the year, the presence
of the various ethnologists being required in the office in connection with the exami-
nation referred to above.

During the year five members of the staff prosecuted systematic researches in the
field, and the sections of the country visited by these and by special assistants include
Alaska, British Columbia, Oregon, California, New Mexico, Oklahoma, Indian
Territory, and the West Indies. Mr. James Mooney was in the field eleven months,
Mrs. M. GC. Stevenson nearly six months, Dr. J. W. Fewkes five months, Dr. John
R. Swanton six months, and Mr. H. H. St. Clair, 2nd, four months—a total of
thirty-two months.

The researches have dealt more or less directly with a large part of the anthropolog-
ical field, and more especially with the history and archeology of the pre-Columbian
tribes of the West Indies; with the social, religious, and esthetic activities of the
tribes of the Great Plains; with the mythology, social institutions, ceremonies, and
art of the Pueblo Indians; with the languages, mythology, and art of the Alaskan
tribes, and with the languages of certain vanishing tribal remnants dwelling in
northern California. The collecting of ethnological and archeological specimens
and of data relating thereto, especially in the field of symbolism as embodied in art,
has received special attention from the field workers.

The scientific researches and work carried on in the office were of exceptional
importance, particularly in connection with the preparation of a cyclopedia of the
Indian tribes, the writing of a handbook of American languages, the compilation of
an archeological map of the United States, the study of visiting delegations of Indians,
and the preparation of exhibits for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. The edi-
torial and library work, the cataloguing of manuscripts, the preparation of illustra-
tions, and the general clerical work have been carried forward in the usual manner.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 47

It was found impracticable, on account of the restricted resources of the Bureau, to
provide for all the branches of work referred to in the plan of operations for the
year. The transcription of the Motul Dictionary was not taken up, and the catalogu-
ing of books and photographic negatives has not received the attention it deserves.
The lack of a permanent force sufficient to cover all the ground was, however, com-
pensated for in part by the temporary employment of special expert help in direc-
tions where such help could be made most effective.

EXPOSITION WORK.

The preparation of an exhibit for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition, begun dur-
ing the preceding year, was continued, and completed shortly after the opening of
the exposition in May. This work was under the personal supervision of the Chief,
who at the same time had charge of the preparation of an extensive exhibit for the
Department of Anthropology of the United States National Museum. The allot-
ment of $2,000, made by the Government Board for the Bureau exhibit, was: too
small to warrant the assemblage of an extensive display; moreover, the space
assigned was extremely scant, and it was decided to confine the exhibit to illustra-
tions of the present field researches of the ethnological corps of the Bureau.

Seeking a subject that would be well within the range of the Bureau’s legitimate
field and yet susceptible of effective presentation by means of objective material, it
was decided to take up and illustrate as the chief topic the mythic symbolism of
various tribes as embodied in their decorative arts. Prominent among the concepts
thus embodied are the various forms of animal and plant life, clouds, lightning,

_rain, sun, moon, and stars, as well as various monsters existing only in the imagina-
tion. These motives are interwoven with the thought and life of the people, and are
introduced freely into their various arts. The forms taken by them are exceedingly
varied, undergoing modifications with the different peoples, and taking distinct
forms in each art according to the nature and form of the object, the method
employed in execution, and the purpose in view.

In selecting the exhibits only the most important symbolic concepts of the tribes
represented were chosen, and for each of these concepts a group of exhibits was
assembled, consisting of a limited number of specimens of native workmanship in
carving, modeling, painting, and engraving, and a series of the native designs drawn
out in colors on a flat surface and associated with the specimens in the exhibit as a
means of further elucidating the strange modifications everywhere displayed.

The series of motives selected to illustrate the symbolic decoration of the Zunis
include the bird, the butterfly, the cornflower insect, the dragon fly, the serpent, the
frog and the tadpole, and the mountain lion; the human form and various monsters;
vegetable forms; and sundry cosmic phenomena, such as clouds, lightning, rain, sun,
moon, stars, and the planets. Doctor Swanton selected from the art of the Northwest
coast tribes a series of very interesting subjects, including the killer whale, the hawk,
the eagle, the thunderbird, and other monsters of the land and the sea. Doctor
Fewkes presented the very artistic symbolism of the ancient tribes of Tusayan in
series of illustrations, including the human form, the serpent, the mountain lion, the
frog and tadpole, the butterfly, the bird, the sunflower, and the heavenly bodies.

These exhibits were supplemented by a series of designs and objects selected by
Dr. Franz Boas to illustrate the varied symbolism associated with a given motive or
design by different tribes and peoples.

In addition to these systematic exhibits, two other important collections were pre-
sented. The archeological researches of Doctor Fewkes in the West Indies were
represented by a large series of typical relics of art in stone, bone, shell, wood, and
clay, selected from the extensive collections made during three winters’ research
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

among the islands. This series is without question the most complete yet brought
together to represent the pre-Columbian culture of the Carib and Arawak peoples,
who were practically exterminated by the Spanish invaders. Mr. Mooney, who is
engaged in the study of the heraldry system of the Great Plains tribes, undertook to
prepare a series of exhibits illustrating this heretofore undeveloped branch of
research. The exhibit consists of shields and models of shields and tipis embel-
lished with the heraldic symbols of the native owners, skins showing elaborate
designs in brilliant colors executed by native artists, and numerous other specimens
having a bearing on this phase of the culture of the Great Plains tribes.

The preparation of an extended exhibit for the National Museum gave the Chief
the opportunity of assembling a large series of exhibits illustrating the higher
achievements of the American race in various branches of art, including architecture,
sculpture, plastic art, carving, basketry, featherwork, and weaving. A leading fea-
ture of the work consisted of restorations of a number of the great ruined buildings
of Mexico and Yucatan. Five models of buildings were made: One on a scale of
one-twelfth, one on a scale of one-eighteenth, and three on a scale of one twenty-
fourth, and much time and research were expended in collecting data and in deter-
mining the details of construction and embellishment. Working plans for use in
the building of these models were prepared by Mr. De Lancey Gill, and the models
were constructed by Mr. H. W. Hendley and Mr. W. H. Gill.

FIELD WORK.

Mr. James Mooney, ethnologist, remained in the field during nearly the entire fis-
cal year, dividing his time between the Kiowa and the Cheyenne, with their asso-
ciated tribes in western Oklahoma, in accordance with the existing joint agreement
between the Bureau and the Field Columbian Museum. The two tribes referred to
occupy adjoining reservations recently opened to white settlement, with agencies
about 100 miles apart.

During July, 1908, Mr. Mooney was operating chiefly in the Cheyenne camp,
spending a week in attendance at the great annual sun dance, where he succeeded
in obtaining the first photographs ever made of the skull-dragging ceremony, and
obtained for the National Museum the sacred buffalo skull used on the altar of
the dance. Shortly afterward he was recalled to Washington, where he remained
until October, returning to the field in time to witness the tomahawk dance of the
Arapaho—an interesting ceremony held only at intervals of several years on the
oceasion of the promotion of the young men of a certain military society from a
lower to a higher degree. Headquarters having been temporarily established at
Darlington, the Cheyenne-Arapaho Agency, the winter months were spent in gath-
ering additional Cheyenne information and in putting the final touches on a series
of Kiowa models to be included in the Bureau’s exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase
Exposition. Early in March Mr. Mooney removed to his permanent headquarters
at Mount Scott, in the Kiowa country. Work was continued on the exposition
exhibit, which was shipped to St. Louis before the close of the month. About the
middle of June he was instructed to proceed to St. Louis to complete the installation
of this material; and, after spending a number of days in the study of the aboriginal
exhibits of the exposition, he returned to the Kiowa country to continue his
researches there.

Dr. J. W. Fewkes, ethnologist, remained in Washington during the first half of
the year, engaged in the completion of his report on the previous winter’s field work
in Porto Rico and Santo Domingo, and in January, 1904, he again proceeded to the
West Indies with instructions to make a reconnaissance of the great chain of islands
connecting Florida with the eastern shore of Venezuela for the purpose of obtaining
a general view of the antiquities and remaining tribal remnants. In January Doctor
Fewkes reached Cuba, where he spent six weeks examining local collections, espe-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

cially those in Havana and Santiago; he also visited Matanzas, Santa Clara, and Puerto
Principe, and made excursions from the city of Santiago to settlements where a few
Indians still lived. The small collections of prehistoric objects obtained in eastern
Cuba were found to resemble those of the neighboring island of Santo Domingo, but
to differ distinctly from those of the western extremity of the island. From Santiago
he proceeded by the way of Jamaica to Trinidad, where he remained three weeks
and gathered a small collection of archeological and ethnological objects and obtained
data regarding the former inhabitants of the island and the present condition of sur-
vivors now living in the town of Arima. Here he obtained some information regard-
ing the ‘‘fire walk,’’ or the ‘‘fire pass,’’ of the cooly residents of the island. From
Trinidad he proceeded along the Lesser Antilles to Porto Rico, remaining, respec-
tively, one or more days at Barbados, Grenada, St. Vincent, and St. Thomas, and
obtaining prehistoric objects at several of these islands.

March and April were mainly spent by Doctor Fewkes on the southern side of the
island of Porto Rico, visiting caves and shell heaps and other sites of prehistoric
occupation. Extensive shell heaps were found at Cayito, near Salinas, and at the
Coamo baths on the estate of Sefior Usera. Several caves showing evidence of former
occupation were found near Ponce. He purchased in Ponce the important collection
of Sefor Neumann, containing several stone collars, rare idols, complete pieces of pot-
tery, and other objects. The whole collection made by Doctor Fewkes, including
ethnological and archeological objects, numbers 630 specimens.

Since his return to Washington in May, Doctor Fewkes has been occupied with
the preparation of a final report of his expeditions to the West Indies during the last
three years.

Mrs. M. C. Stevenson, ethnologist, was engaged during the first six months of the year
in completing her monograph of the Zui Indians and in preparing it for the press.
In January she set out for New Mexico with the view of continuing her researches
in certain directions, especially with respect to the relation of the Zuni people to
other tribes of the general region. Chief attention was given to the mythological
system and to the ceremonial dances, which followed in quick succession during the
late winter and the early spring months.

Mrs. Stevenson found the people of Zufi much changed in recent years. The
former gentleness of character and the marked courtesy of the primitive aborigines
has entirely disappeared, save with a few of the older men and women, the desire
of sordid gain engendered by contact with the whites outweighing every other
motive.

Mrs. Stevenson was commissioned to collect material illustrative of her researches
in Zuni, to form part of the Bureau’s exhibit at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition,
the special topic being the religious symbolism embodied in the various arts, such
as pottery, textiles, basketry, in costumes, altars, images, and other ceremonial objects.
Her study of this subject, heretofore much neglected, was thorough, and the signitfi-
cance of nearly every symbol now used by the Zuni was obtained. She observed
that, while the officers of the secret fraternities have a thorough understanding of the
symbolism associated with their altars, few persons know the meanings of the designs
employed in pottery and the other useful arts, the artists themselves having little
appreciation of the poetic imagery associated with the various figures. Mrs. Steven-
son believes that the original significance of the decorative motives of the Zufi
people will soon be lost by them.

Aside from her systematic researches, a number of special subjects were investi-
gated by Mrs. Stevenson, including the irrigating system of the Zufi at Ojo Caliente,
the manufacture and use of the native dyeing materials, the preparation of pig-
ments, etc.

Early in August Dr. John R. Swanton, ethnologist, handed in a typewritten copy
of the Haida texts obtained at Skidegate, Queen Charlotte Islands, during the winter

sm 1904——4
5O REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

of 1900-1901, with accompanying translations. Subsequently he was engaged in
copying and translating a second set of texts obtained at Masset, Queen Charlotte
Islands, during the same expedition.

On December 16 Doctor Swanton returned to the Northwest to engage in field work,
particularly among the Tlingit Indians of the Alaskan coast. From January 9 to
March 21 he was at Sitka among the northern Tlingit, and from then until May 5
among the southern members of that family. On the way thither he engaged in
some incidental work among the Haida, and during the season he collected about
one hundred Tlingit myths, as well as much ethnologic material in other branches.
One of Doctor Swanton’s main objects in this expedition was to define the relations
between the Haida and Tlingit peoples, looking to the possibility of a genetic rela-
tionship between them. A final conclusion on this point can not yet be given, but
it was discovered that many of the resemblances noted between the two languages
are due to an early residence of the Tlingit opposite the Haida on the coast now occu-
pied by the Tsimshian. This fact, aiready partially recognized, and now practically
demonstrated by Doctor Swanton, results in limiting the origin of much of the culture
on this coast to the immediate neighborhood of Hecate Strait, northern British

Columbia. An important contribution to the general subject of clan organization

was made by the discovery of a small Tlingit group which practiced marriage with
either of the two great clans.

Since his return to the office Doctor Swanton has been engaged, first, in revising
the Tlingit material for the Cyclopedia of Indian Tribes in the light of the fresh
information gained during his recent trip; and, second, in copying the texts taken
among the Tlingit.

Mr. H. H. St. Clair, 2nd, special assistant in Philology, visited northern California
and southern Oregon early in the year for the purpose of collecting data among the
Rogue River, Coos, and other small tribal remnants, of which a few individuals sur-
vive in that region, and a number of valuable vocabularies were secured.

OFFICE WORK,

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, ethnologist, has continued the preparation and proof-reading
of part 1 of hismonograph on Iroquoian cosmology, which is to appear in the Twenty-
first Annual Report. The reading of the galleys of the interlinear translation and
the free translations into English of the Onondaga, the Seneca, and the Mohawk
versions of this cosmology occupied a large part of his time during the year. Exten-
sive revision was required on account of the premature transmission of the manuscript
to the printer in 1902. This caused much delay, but it was considered advisable
to permit the delay rather than to have the paper published in a form unsatisfactory
to the author. ;

As custodian of linguistic manuscripts, Mr. Hewitt, assisted by Miss Smedes, con-
tinued the work of revising and bringing up to date the card catalogue of the lin-
guistic and other manuscripts in the archives of the Bureau. This card catalogue
was originally prepared in 1896-97 by Mr. Hewitt, with the assistance of the late
Rey. J. Owen Dorsey, and in this work the manuscripts were classified under three
main heads: First, the author or collector; second, the tribe or band-village; and
third, linguistic stock—all under one ‘alphabet. The cross-reference catalogue of
the names of tribes and villages noted in the manuscripts is of very great use for
the purpose of comparison and research and for determining the number and distri-
bution of these manuscripts among the various stocks. In the present revision
the work consists in making a duplicate copy of the card descriptive of the manu-
script, which duplicate is pasted on the jacket or package containing the manuscript.
A number is affixed to the original card, to the duplicate, and to the manuscript
itself for the purpose of ready identification. New cards are being made for manu-
scripts acquired since the completion of the original catalogue in 1897. This scheme
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 51

has been applied to the manuscripts belonging to the Algonquian, the Athapascan,
and the Iroquoian stocks. The work on these stocks is far advanced. All the cards
of the original catalogue have been thus copied in duplicate.

Previous to the death of Maj. J. W. Powell, the late Director of this Bureau, the
linguistic material, chiefly Shoshonean, which was collected personally by him in the
field, was not placed in the archives of the office; but since that time this material
has been incorporated with that already contained in the archives. <A part of this
material is still uncatalogued.

Mr. Hewitt has been called upon to do considerable work on the Iroquoian stock
for the Dictionary of Indian Tribes, and much of the correspondence of the Bureau
relating to linguistics has been placed in his hands.

During the year Dr. Cyrus Thomas, ethnologist, was engaged mainly on the Dic-
tionary of Indian Tribes, under the direction of Mr. F. W. Hodge. The work con-
sisted in preparing for final editing some of the families not finished at the com-
mencement of the year, in reexamining the cards which had been previously passed
over (to N) for the purpose of inserting any omitted titles and cross references, and in
taking general care of the Dictionary cards. During the early part of the year con-
siderable time was devoted by Doctor Thomas to the reading of final proofs of his
second paper on the Maya calendar systems, which is to appear in the Twenty-first
Annual Report.

Dr. A. 8. Gatschet was engaged during the year in his linguistic work, mainly on
his Algonquian texts, and some advance has been made in the compilation of his
dictionary and grammar of the Peoria language. In addition, Doctor Gatschet has
been called upon for information in his particular field for correspondents of the
Bureau.

SPECIAL RESEARCHES AND WORK.

Under the direction of Dr. Franz Boas, honorary philologist of the Bureau, consid-
erable progress has been made in the preparation of the Handbook of American Lan-
guages. Doctor Boas has not been able to devote any great portion of his own time
to the work during the year, but it has been fully outlined, and a number of collabo-
rators have begun the preparation of special papers. The introductory chapters of
the work are assigned to Doctor Boas.

Mr. F. W. Hodge, of the Smithsonian Institution, has continued in charge of the
Cyclopedia of Indian Tribes, and substantial progress has been made in its compila-
tion. Much time has been consumed in revising and verifying the work of former
years and in bringing the whole up to a uniform standard of excellence. Mr. Hodge
has been assisted by Dr. Cyrus Thomas, ethnologist; Mr. Frank Huntington, edito-
rial assistant, and Mrs. Nichols, typewriter, and has received contributions from
numerous authors, including members of the Bureau and others intrusted with the
treatment of special topics. The Cyclopedia work has been delayed by the lack of
sufficient funds for the employment of skilled assistants.

Dr. Stewart Culin, of the Museum of the Brooklyn Institute of Arts and Sciences, has
completed and handed in his monograph on American Indian games, and this great
work was placed in the hands of the editor of the Bureau at the close of the year.

The plan of operations for the year included the provision that the Bureau should
undertake the preparation of a measure for the preservation of our national antiqui-
ties, for submission to Congress. The Institution had previously interested itself in
this subject, and in order that it might be prepared with a knowledge of what Goy-
ernments of other countries had done in this direction, it was determined to make a
study of the entire subject, and Mr. J. D. McGuire was temporarily employed to
make investigations and formulate a measure. This step was taken, and the measure
was in due course presented in the House and Senate. In prosecuting this work
translations were made of the laws of various countries, including Mexico, France,
52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Germany, Italy, Sweden, Egypt, and Turkey, and others were thoroughly studied.
Mr. McGuire also compiled much material relating to governmental support of
anthropologic science in various countries. Later he took up and made much prog-
ress in the preparation of an archeological map of the United States, devoting his
attention chiefly to the middle Atlantic coast section.

Each year, especially during the winter season when Congress is in session, numer-
ous delegations of Indians visit Washington. It has been customary to have photo-
graphs made of members of these delegations in the Bureau laboratory, but hereto-
fore the work has not been systematized. As proposed in the plan of operations,
careful attention was given to this subject during the year. Mr. Andrew John, an
Iroquois Indian, resident in the city, was employed to interview and make the
acquaintance of all delegations on their arrival, with the view of conducting them to
the laboratories of the Bureau and the National Museum, where arrangements were
made to have measurements and photographs taken, and plaster masks also made
of all who were willing to submit to the process. In the absence of proper labora-
tories in the Bureau for all save the photographic work, the delegations were in the
main conducted to the laboratories of the National Museum, where every facility was
afforded. The results of the year’s work have been most satisfactory: One hundred
and ten 8 by 10 negatives were made by Mr. Smillie and his assistants; measurements
of 52 individuals were taken by Dr. Ales’ Hrdlicka in the Physical Laboratory; and
masks of 20 individuals were made by Mr. William Palmer. The following is a list
of the principal delegations, with the numbers conducted to the laboratories in each
case:

COLLECTIONS.

The collections of ethnological and archeological specimens made during the year
are exceptionally important. A special effort was made to obtain material for the
purpose of illustrating the researches of the Bureau at the Louisiana Purchase Exposi-
tion. Valuable additions along this line were obtained by Doctor Fewkes in the West
Indies, by Mrs. Stevenson in the Pueblo country, by Doctor Swanton in Alaska and
British Columbia, and by Mr. Mooney in Oklahoma and Indian Territory. Seven
hundred and seventy-eight specimens have been transferred to the National Museum,
and such of these as were required for the purpose were sent to the exposition.
Other collections were forwarded directly to the exposition and have not been
transferred.

In order that collections made by the Bureau may receive immediate attention
with respect to preservation from moths and other insects, and with the view of
having them properly and promptly catalogued, they are, on arrival in Washington,
placed in the hands of the head curator of anthropology of the National Museum,
who has at hand all necessary facilities for preservation and record. It is understood,
howeyer, that these collections are at all times to be at the disposal of the Bureau for
purposes of study and illustration. In all, about 1,000 specimens, mostly of excep-
tional value, have been acquired during the year.

ILLUSTRATIONS,

The work of the illustrations division remained in charge of Mr. De Lancey Gill.
Illustrations for two annual reports—the Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth—and for
Bulletin 28 were edited and prepared for transmittal to the Public Printer; 137

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

drawings for the illustration of these volumes were made, and 900 engravings for the
same were examined and necessary corrections indicated. In the photographic
branch of the work, wherein Mr. Gill was assisted, as heretofore, by Mr. Henry
Walther, 166 negatives were taken, 132 films exposed in the field were developed,
and 1,373 prints were made.

Mr. Gill was also called upon to assist in preparing exhibits for the Louisiana Pur-
chase Exposition, and made during the year detailed plans required in the construc-
tion of models of the Temple of the Cross at Palenque, and the Castillo at Chiche-
nitza, and also of two models illustrating in actual dimensions the remarkable
sculptural embellishments characteristic of the ancient Mayan architecture.

PUBLICATIONS.

The Twentieth Annual Report and Part I of the Twenty-second have been issued
during the year, the former in March and the latter in May, 1904. The Twenty-first
and Part II of the Twenty-second are in press. The Twenty-third was submitted
for publication on February 23, and Bulletin 28 was sent to the Public Printer on
March 31, 1904.

Publications are sent to two classes of recipients: First, regularly, without special
request, to working anthropologists, public libraries, scientific societies, institutions
of learning, and to other persons or institutions able to contribute to the work of the
Bureau publications, ethnologic specimens, or desirable data; second, to other per-
sons or institutions in response to special requests, usually indorsed by members
of Congress. During the year 1,946 copies of the Twentieth Annual Report have
been sent to regular recipients, and 2,500 miscellaneous volumes and pamphlets have
been distributed in response to about an equal number of special requests. More
than 250 of these requests have come through Congressmen, and about 500 volumes
have been sent inresponse. One hundred and fifteen copies of Part I of the Twenty-
second Annual Report have been sent out.

EDITORIAL WORK.

Mr. Herbert S. Wood has had charge of the editorial work during the year, being
assisted in several instances by Dr. Elbert J. Benton, Mr. E. G. Farrell (courteously
detailed for the work by the Government Printing Office), and Mr. William Bar-
num. The editorial work for the year has consisted chiefly in the reading of proofs
of the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Annual Reports, and the preparation for
printing of the Twenty-third Annual Report.

LIBRARY.

At the time of the removal of the Bureau of American Ethnology from the United
States Geological Survey building in 1893, the volumes belonging to the Bureau num-
bered about 2,500. Through exchange and purchase the growth of the library has
been, on the whole, satisfactory. The library now contains 12,165 bound volumes,
about 6,500 pamphlets, and a large number of periodicals. In the purchase of books
care has been used to add only such works as bear on the subject of anthropology
with special reference to the American Indians, although volumes relating to kin-
dred subjects are received through exchange.

The accessions for the year number 302 bound volumes, about 500 pamphlets, and
the regular issues of more than 500 periodicals.

CLERICAL WORK.

The clerical work of the Bureau has been intrusted largely to Mr. J. B. Clayton,
who on June 1, 1904, with the approval of the Civil Service Commission, received
the designation of head clerk. Mr, Clayton has had personal charge of the financial

~
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

work of the Bureau, including the purchase of supplies and the preparation of
accounts.

The clerical work during the year included the registration and cataloguing of
letters, the preparation of replies to letters, and the keeping of miscellaneous records.
The method described in the report for the previous year as having been adopted
has been employed during this year, and the clerical work of the Bureau is kept
up to date. Asa rule, letters are answered the same day that they are received, and
it is only where technical information is called for that there is any delay what-
ever. The letters in regard to publications, finances, field work, and miscellaneous
information coyer 2,835 pages in the press-copy letter books.

Miss E. R. Smedes has given excellent service in connection with the peneral cor-
respondence of the Bureau. The clerical work in the Library has been satisfactorily
attended to by Miss Ella Leary.

The very considerable work involved in the care and distribution of publications
has been in charge of Miss May 8. Clark, who has efficiently met the Bureau’s needs
in this direction.

Mrs. F. 8. Nichols was certified by the Civil Service Commission for temporary
work in connection with the Dictionary of Indian Tribes, and Misses Postley, Stratton,
and Taliaferro were employed for brief periods in the same work.

PROPERTY.

The property of the Bureau is comprised in seven classes, as follows:

Office furniture and appliances.

Field outfits.

Ethnological Bares and other documents.

Photographs, drawings, paintings, and engravings.

REPORT ON THE OPERATIONS OF THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE
SERVICE.

Str: I have the honor to submit the following report relating to the operations of
the International Exchange Service during the year ending June 30, 1904:

The term ‘‘International Exchanges’’ has been applied by the Smithsonian Insti-
tution almost since its foundation to the interchange of its publications for those of
scientific societies and establishments in foreign countries. A liberal distribution of
the works published at the expense of the Smithson fund was one of the principal
means adopted in the early plans of the Institution for administering that part of
the bequest of its founder relating to the “diffusion of knowledge among men.”’

In order to carry out a systematic exchange of large quantities of books it was nec-
essary to enlist the cooperation of institutions and individuals in the populous centers
of the world, and as it became known that such arrangement existed, first one then
another society and finally the United States Government asked the Smithsonian
Institution to perform a similar service in exchanging its publications, until the
expense became a heavy tax on the income of the Institution.

In 1881 Congress made a small appropriation to the Smithsonian Institution in aid
of the Exchange Service, and has since continued to make an annual appropriation,
though at no time has it been sufficient to cover the extire expense of the service,
consequently the Institution has been obliged to request a partial reimbursement of
the pro rata expense from Federal and State institutions.

Nearly 159,000 packages were dispatched during the year ended June 30, 1904, each
of which was credited to the contributor and debited to the recipient. A recapitula-
tion was also made, showing the aggregate contributions and receipts by each country.
This necessary detail, in addition to the routine work of receiving and dispatching
parcels, requires the continuous service of fifteen employees. The work requires the
exclusive use of five rooms, which are arranged along the south basement of the Smith-
sonian building. These rooms, though originally remodeled and arranged expressly
for the exchange service, have since been enlarged to some extent, but at times, when
exchanges are received in unusual quantities, it is necessary temporarily to occupy
adjoining rooms and hallways.

Aside from packing materials the supplies required are those necessary to a well-
regulated office and for the greater part are procured under annual Government
contracts.

Two instances have been reported during the year of loss or damage to exchange
parcels in transit. One case, No. 414, for China, was subjected to the process of
‘‘general average”’ on account of damage to the steamship St. Bede, but a full report
has not yet been submitted.

A case containing United States Government documents (designated as No. 90 of
the official set), destined for the Parliamentary Library, Hobart, Tasmania, was
destroyed while en route from London to Hobart, but most of the publications were
fortunately duplicated.

The following tables describe the operations of the service during the year, and in
comparison with the preceding year show a gain of 8,766 packages, or a total of
- 158,983, being an increase of 6,183 in the number sent abroad and an increase of 2,583
received from other countries. On the other hand, the total weight of exchanges

55
56 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

transmitted was less by 14 per cent. This inconsistency in figures was due to a pre-
ponderance of unusually large packages forwarded abroad during the year ended
June 30, 1903, but the greater number of parcels during the last year shows an
increased interest in the service and has resulted in adding several thousand names
to the list of correspondents.

It is gratifying to note that of the weight of exchanges handled during the year
ended June 30, 1904, 75 per cent was from domestic sources and 25 per cent from
abroad, while during the previous year the proportions were 73.8 per cent and 26.2
per cent, respectively.

In July, 1897, an exchange list of foreign institutions was published which con-
tained 9,414 addresses. The necessity for a revised list arising, a new edition was
published in September, 1903, containing 12,720 addresses. This list, printed in
limited edition at the expense of the Smithsonian Institution, is intended as a work-
ing guide for the United States International Exchange Service and its distributing
agencies throughout the world, rather than for general distribution.

The following table represents the exchange transmissions for the several Depart-
ments and Bureaus of the Government during the year, showing a total of 16,235
packages received from abroad, and 74,863 packages sent to other countries, being
an increase over the previous year of 29.5 per cent and 1.2 per cent, respectively.

Although still so far less than this Government’s contributions, the receipts from
abroad during the year show a substantial increase and it is believed mark the
beginning of new activity on the part of other governments in reciprocating for
the donations which have been made for so many years through the Smithsonian

Institution.

RELATIVE INTERCHANGE OF PUBLICATIONS BETWEEN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER
COUNTRIES.

Following is a comparative statement of exchange transmissions between the
United States and other countries during the years 1903 and 1904, respectively.
Exchanges were conducted with 151 countries during the year ended June 30, 1904,

or 16 more than during the preceding year. This demonstrates the constant growth _

of the service, extending even to remote parts of the world:

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 63

In the main the same arrangements for distributing exchanges in other countries
have continued during the year as have existed in the past. But one change requires
special notice. I refer to the death at Leipzig-Gohlis, on February 6, 1904, of Dr.
Carl Felix Alfred Fligel, in his eighty-fourth year.

Doctor Fliigel succeeded his father in 1855 as agent of the Smithsonian Institution
for the kingdoms and principalities which now constitute the German Empire, and
continued in that capacity until his death, a continuous service of forty-nine years.

His long term of office gave Doctor Fligel an exceptional opportunity to further
the work of the International Exchange Service throughout central Europe, of which
he never failed to take advantage.

Doctor Fligel published numerous pamphlets and critical essays on the English
language, and was the author of the standard work extensively known as Fliigel’s
Dictionary of the English and German languages, which reached its fifteenth edition
in1891. The Institution deeply regrets his loss.

Mr. W. Irving Adams, chief clerk of the International Exchange Service, was in
Leipzig on official business at the time of the death of Doctor Fligel and took imme-
diate steps to recommend the selection of his successor in order that the work of the
agency should suffer as little inconvenience as possible. The long and. faithful
service, the scholarly attainments, and wide acquaintance of Doctor Fligel made the
selection of a suitable person a not inconsiderable task; but after careful inquiry Mr.
Adams selected Mr. Karl W. Hiersemann, the bookseller of Leipzig, as Doctor
Fliigel’s successor, and on March 8, 1904, the Secretary approved the selection by
tendering Mr. Hiersemann the appointment. The central location of Mr. Hierse-
mann’s establishment and his efficient clerical staff have already shown the selection
to have been a fortunate one.

The progress of diplomatic negotiations between the United States and China with
a view of establishing mutual exchange relations have frequently been referred to in
the annual reports of the Exchange Service, and I am now pleased to announce that
the matter has been referred by the Chinese department of foreign affairs to the
superintendent of trade for the south (Nanking viceroy ), with authority to deal with
it. It would therefore seem that official exchange relations with China more nearly
approach consummation than ever before. Meanwhile only occasional publications
are received from China by mail, and no provision exists for sending exchanges from
the United States to China except to addresses in Shanghai.

The indirect method of forwarding parcels to the West Indies through the Crown
agents for the colonies in London has been abolished, and the services of colonial
officers and educational institutions in several of the islands have been enlisted
instead. In the near future it is hoped that similar arrangements will be perfected
with other British colonies.

The department of foreign affairs, Bangkok, Siam, has accepted the invitation of
the Institution to enter into a mutual arrangement for an exchange of publications,
both governmental and scientific.

Following is a list of correspondents abroad through which the distribution of
exchanges is accomplished. Those in the larger and in many of the smaller coun-
tries forward to the Smithsonian Institution reciprocal contributions for distribution
in the United States.

68 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

As new countries are constantly being added, the sets for the depositories desig-
nated under the last resolution are not forwarded simultaneously with those originally
provided, but are delivered to the Institution from the Library of Congress and are
dispatched with the next succeeding consignments of miscellaneous exchanges.

Messrs. William Wesley & Son and Dr. Joseph von Ko6résy continue to represent
the Institution in Great Britain and Hungary, respectively, but, as above mentioned,
a new agent, in the person of Mr. Karl W. Hiersemann, has been appointed to suc-
ceed the late Doctor Fliigel in Germany. To these gentlemen, who are compensated
by the Institution for their services, to the many individuals and institutions who
render valuable aid in the promotion of the exchange service at large, and to Mr.
Charles A. King, deputy collector of the port of New York, the grateful acknowledg-
ments of the Smithsonian Institution are due.

Mr. W. Irving Adams, chief clerk of the International Exchange Service, returned
on May 30, 1904, from a journey to Europe, undertaken for the purpose of promoting
the interest of the service. It gives me pleasure to say that his observations will
result in enlarging the scope of the Exchange Service and in inaugurating many
improvements.

Permit me to commend the efficient manner in which the work of the Exchanges
has been conducted by the office force under the immediate supervision of Mr. Adams,
and, in his absence, under Mr. F. V. Berry. The increased work of the service,
brought about by its growing usefulness, has sometimes been almost overwhelming,
nevertheless there has been no undue delay in the transmission and distribution of
the many thousands of packages handled and recorded during the year.

Respectfully submitted.

F. W. Hopes,
Acting Curator of Exchanges.
Mr. S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
PARK.

Srr: I have the honor to herewith submit the following report relating to the con-
dition and operations of the National Zoological Park for the year ending June 30,
1904.

At the close of that period the approximate value of the property belonging to the

The cost for purchase, collection, and transportation of these accessions has been
$4,500.

The appropriation for the general service of the park was made in the following
terms:

‘For continuing the construction of roads, walks, bridges, water supply, sewerage
and drainage; and for grading, planting, and otherwise improving the grounds;
erecting and repairing buildings and inclosures; care, subsistence, purchase, and
transportation of animals, including salaries or compensation of all necessary employ-
. ees, the purchase of necessary books and periodicals, the printing and publishing of
operations, not exceeding one thousand five hundred copies, and general incidental
expenses not otherwise provided for, ninety-five thousand dollars.”’

70 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

For some years past the want of sufficient accommodations for the animals at the
park has been severely felt. This need seemed during the past season so urgent that
all other objects not imperatively necessary for the maintenance of the collection
were deferred, and the available resources were applied to the erection of a new
house for mammals.

After consultation with Mr. F. L. Olmsted a site for the structure was selected
near the principal animal house, in the situation shown in the accompanying plat
(Pl. 1). It was decided to build it of stone, using the same gray gneiss, found in the
region of Rock Creek, that was used in building the principal house. A plan of the
main floor of the structure is shown herewith (Pl. II). Its dimensions are as follows:

On reference to the accompanying plan it will be seen that the cages for the ani-
mals are arranged so as to be accessible from both front and rear. Small movable
passageways will connect these inner cages with those to be constructed about the
exterior of the building, stretching in each case across the service passage in the
rear. The building will be lighted almost wholly by skylights, situated over the
cages, so that the animals are in full light while the public is in comparative
obscurity.

A contract was made for the walls of this building February 5, 1904. These walls
were completed June 15, 1904, at a cost of $6,573. Other contracts have been made
as follows:

Bomthe structural ironworkeeesans 2) sees ee eee eee ee ae ae eee eee $7, 662
Horthe tile roots: ce cee oe oe oe ee ee oe oe ee a tear eeerte 4,495

It is hoped that the iron work will be completed by October 31, 1904, and the
tiling about a month later.

It is estimated that the total cost of the building will be about $40,000.

Fitttng up old elephant house.-—To supply temporarily the accommodations so
badly needed for small mammals, the barn formerly occupied by the elephant was
repaired and fitted up for this class of animals. It furnishes 23 cages. This cost $500.

New boiler in antelope house.—The heating boiler in the antelope house was one
which had previously served for some years in the Smithsonian Institution building.
At the close of the winter of 1902-3 it was found to be so badly corroded that it could
no longer be used. A new vertical boiler was put in at a cost of $250.

New inclosure for buffaloes.—The buffalo paddocks on the steep northeastern slope
of the narrow valley of Rock Creek were not sanitary. Asa herd from Messrs. Cody
and Bailey was accepted on deposit, it was necessary to construct a new inclosure on
the hill near the Connecticut Avenue entrance. This was fenced with the posts and
woven-wire fencing from the old paddocks, the cost of the paddock and shelter being
$500.

New raccoon tree.—The large tulip poplar, which had been occupied by the raccoons
for a number of years, finally died. It was not in good condition when the park was
established, and a heavy fill of earth had been made over its roots. To replace this
a large oak was moved during the winter, and a new fence was built. This cost $500.

Repair and alteration of Adams Mill road.—The portion of Adams Mill road from the
foot of the hill to the log bridge was in bad shape from irregular settling. During

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. (al

the summer of 1903 the crown was reformed and a new surface dressing of crushed
limestone was put on at a cost of $450. (This section of road is still in almost perfect
condition, a good example of the ease with which a comparatively level road can be
kept in repair as against one on a steep grade. )

This road was also widened at the entrance and reshaped to conform to the new
lines of the highway approach outside. Cost, $250.

Repairing log bridge.—It was found that the floods in the creek had cut into and
undermined the north abutment of this bridge, and additional concrete was put in
and faced with stone slabs. The trend of the current against the abutment was pre-
vented for the future by removing a gravel bank and burying a few logs in the edge
of the stream to turn the water toward the center and prevent scouring. Cost, $250.

Water supply from the main on Connecticut avenue extended.—The water supply for
the entire park had been furnished by a 6-inch main, laid at the expense of the park,
down Quarry road from Columbia road. The supply in the higher parts of the park,
on the west side, was not satisfactory, and it was impossible to maintain sufficient
pressure when water was being used in the lower levels. A new pipe to supply the
western part of the park was laid from the main on Connecticut avenue extended,
at a cost of $250.

Bookcases for office.—Reference books and bookcases for the superintendent’s
office were purchased during the year at a cost of $200.

Noteworthy accessions.—A young male lion, presented to the President by King
Menelik, of Abyssinia, was deposited in the park by the President. A spotted hyena,
presented by N. E. Skinner, special envoy to King Menelik. Twelve American bison
were loaned by Messrs. Bailey and Cody. One phalanger and 2 bridled ws allabies
were received from Dr. F. W. Goding, United States consul at Newcastle, New South
Wales. Four coyotes were presented by Major Pitcher, acting superintendent, Yel-
lowstone National Park. Nine wandering tree ducks were presented by Carl Hagen-
beck. One Himalayan bear was received from the New York Zoological Park in
exchange.

Purchases.—A Kodiak bear. (This species is the largest carnivorous land animal
now in existence; one killed at English Bay, Kodiak Island, weighed 1,756 pounds. )
In this connection it is of interest to note that the male of Ursus dalli gyas, now in
the park, which weighed in June, 1903, 450 pounds, had attained a weight, January
18, 1904, of 625 pounds. A Mexican mountain sheep. <A pair of yearling moose
obtained in Manitoba. <A pair of jaguars. A male Bactrian camel, procured as a
mate for the female already in the collection. A California condor. A female black
bear, from the Province of Quebec; an unusually fine specimen, weighing 380 pounds.

Births.—Kight wild turkeys hatched in the park. Brown pelican, sandhill crane,
and Canada goose also nested, and the emu laid two eggs.

Important losses. Two American bison, gastro-enteritis. One pair moose. One
American antelope. Mule deer—3 from disease, 2 from fright by buffalo, 1 female
killed by amale. Two jaguars—intense catarrhal inflammation throughout intestinal
tract; virulent colon Buus found, pathogenic to rabbits and guineapigs. One puma.
Black bear—pneumonia, 2; gastro-enteritis from Ascaris transfuga, 2. One grizzly
bear, gastro-enteritis with nephritis; in the collection since June, 1888. One sun
bear, from gastro-enteritis. One Japanese bear, shock from cutting claws. Four
Arctic foxes, no intestinal worms found; they were found in subsequent cases. Two
European flamingoes, Tropidocerca (a nematode worm found in subsequent cases)
producing fatal inflammation of the digestive tract. One cassowary from serous
pericarditis.

A considerable number of monkeys, birds (parrots, ete.), and snakes died from
results of overcrowding or lack of proper quarters.

The post-mortem examinations were made by the Bureau of Animal Industry, to
whose courtesy the thanks of the park are due,

72 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Exchange with New Zealand government.—The New Zealand government arranged,
through the President, to obtain elk from the herd in the National Zoological Park
in exchange for other animals. Ten elk are to be sent, and will be forwarded in the
autumn of 1904, after the horns are hard and the young have been weaned.

Readjustment of boundaries. —The desirability of having the park bordered by high-
ways along the eastern and western sides has been urged at various times and brought
to the attention of Congress. A bill for the establishment of highways adjacent to
the park was submitted by the Commissioners of the District of Columbia during the
session of 1908-4, and passed as given below:

“AN ACT Por the opening of connecting highways on the east and west sides of the zoological park,
District of Columbia,

‘*Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the United States of America
in Congress assembled, That within six months after the passage of this act the Com-
missioners of the District of Columbia be, and they are hereby, authorized and
directed to institute in the supreme court of the District of Columbia, sitting as a
district court, by petition, particularly describing the lands to be taken, a proceedin
in rem to condemn ine land that may be necessary for connecting the north end o
Adams Mill road in Lanier Heights with south end of Park road in Ingleside by a
highway fifty feet wide along or near the eastern boundary of the zoological park,
also for connec ting ¢ ‘athedral avenue with Klingle road by a highway fifty feet wide
along or near the western boundary of the zoologice il park, all in accordance with
plans on file in the office of the Engineer Commissioner, District of Columbia.’? Publie
act, April 28, 1904.

The estimates for the park for the year 1904-5, as submitted to Congress, contained
the following item:

“Readjustment of boundaries, National Zoological Park: Acquirement of the
tract of land lying between the present eastern boundary of the National Zoological
Park and the new highway to be established by the District of Columbia from
Adams Mill road to Kenesaw avenue, and also of the tract lying between the present
western boundary of said park and the new highway to be established by the Dis-
trict of Columbia from Cathedral avenue to Klingle road, sixty thousand dollars;
and said land, when acquired, to becomea part of the 1 National Zoological Park.”’

Congress took no action upon this estimate.

Exhibit at Louisiana Purchase Exposition.—In view of the importance of bringing
before the general public the aims and objects of the park it was thought proper to
prepare an exhibit of some extent for the Louisiana Purchase Exposition. This
consisted of a display of living birds confined in a flying cage occupying a ground
space of 84 by 228 feet, and from 50 to 55 feet in height. It was constructed by the
St. Paul Foundry Company, according to plans prepared by the Supervising Architect
of the Treasury Department after preliminary sketches furnished by the park. The
cost of the cage was about $15,000. Its frame consists of light steel arches, covered
by a wire netting with three-fourths-inch mesh. <A longitudinal partition divides
the cage into two parts, and a passage for the public 14 feet wide extends from end
to end,

One side is occupied mainly by marsh and water birds and has two swimming pools,
each from 50 to 60 feet long. The other side is occupied mainly by song birds and
small species noted for bright plumage, and has two smaller pools with a streamlet
of water trickling from one to the other, a distance of 90 feet, through a series of
small, shallow basins that afford drinking and bathing places for the little birds.
This side includes several moderate-sized growing trees which were left in their
natural situation, Besides these, many small trees and shrubs were planted and the
surface was sodded. The cage was located in a natural grove of trees not far from
the Government building in the exposition grounds. All ground improvements,
including water supply, ete., were furnished by the exposition company at its own
expense.

The cost of stocking and maintaining the cage was defrayed from the Government

exhibit fund. Birds were purchased from dealers and collectors, but, as it was
desirable to have as many as possible already accustomed to such confinement, a
considerable number were supplied from the stock in the National Zoological Park.
A head keeper and one underkeeper were eniployed during the month of May and
another underkeeper during June.

It is expected that at the close of the exposition the cage will be brought to Wash-
ington and ultimately erected in the National Zoological Park.

APPENDIX V.

REPORT OF THE WORK OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY FOR
THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1904.

Str: The kinds and amounts of Observatory property are approximately as follows:

Buildings... 2 2<<tii cc cce te oO ae a ee eee $6, 3800
Apparatus 2.2: .2c2 te 26 22 2 ee ee ee 41, 400

To tall a= sceseiors Ses Boks eos eee le eS ee ee 54, 500

During the past year the acquisitions of property have been as follows:

(a) Apparatus.—Astronomical and physical apparatus has been purchased at an
expenditure of $4,500. The most important pieces comprise a new spectrobolometric
outfit, to be used in the study of the great solar image of the 140-foot focus horizon-
tal telescope, and also for a proposed expedition to some elevated station for the
determination of the solar constant. Of the sum expended for apparatus, $2,430 was
chargeable to the appropriations of 1901-2 and 1902-3. Shelters for the great hori-
zontal telescope and apparatus for the research on the solar constant have been
ordered, at an estimated expenditure of $1,230. A ground plan of the Observatory
enclosure, including the new shelters, is shown in Plate V.

(b) Library and records.—The usual periodicals have been continued, and a few
books of reference purchased. Three new cases have been procured for storage of
books and periodicals. The total expenditure for these purposes is $340.

The Observatory buildings have been repainted at a cost of $195. No losses of
property worthy of note have occurred during the year.

THE WORK OF THE OBSERVATORY.

For convenience the work may be classified as follows:
1. Publications and miscellaneous matters.

2. Improvements of apparatus.

3. Investigations.

1. Publications and miscellaneous matters.

Eclipse report.—The report of the solar eclipse expedition to Wadesboro, N. C., of
May, 1900, referred to in my last year’s report, has been distributed, and has been
favorably noticed both in this country and abroad.

St. Louis Exposition.—A far more elaborate exhibition of the Observatory work
than usual has been prepared and installed for the St. Louis Exposition under your
instructions. The great coelostat, mentioned in my last year’s report, is arranged to
throw a beam of sunlight into a darkened portion of the room occupied by the
Observatory exhibit, where a solar image about a yard in diameter is thrown up by
a 6-inch telescope, and the solar spectrum is formed upon the walls of the room by a
large concave grating.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 79

A display of transparencies showing apparatus, buildings, and results of observa-
tion isa prominent object to visitors as they enter the room, and thence they pass
through the darkened chamber above mentioned and get a view of the solar spec-
trum and of such sun spots as are visible. As they leave the darkened chamber they
come upon a group of bolometric apparatus in actual operation and sensitive enough
to give 100 or more scale divisions deflection when the visitor holds his hand in
front of the bolometer. Charts and reports illustrative of the work of the Observa-
tory are found upon the walls. A large number of copies of a pamphlet descriptive
of the Observatory and its studies have been freely distributed.

2. Improvements of apparatus.

Bolometer.—The bolometer and its adjuncts had reached so high a state of perfec-
tion, as described in my last year’s report, that further improvement could hardly be
expected, but in order to make it practicable to set up so sensitive an instrument at
the St. Louis Exposition and leave it without expert attention for months, it was felt
desirable to combine in compact form the most approved methods of construction,
having special reference to simplicity of manipulation, so that the instrument could
be safely left in unskilled hands. Accordingly the bolometric apparatus, shown in
Plate VI, was designed at the Observatory and constructed in the Observatory shop.

Asin the form shown in Plate XII A of Volume I of the Annals of the Astro-
physical Observatory, all the adjuncts to the bolometer, excepting the battery and
galvanometer, are combined in a single case, adjusted mechanically from outside, but
in this new form the adjusting slide wires are straight, instead of spiral, and no
clamping mechanism is required, so that the construction is much simplified and can
hardly get out of order. At the same time five slide wires are provided of differing
sensitiveness of adjustment, so that by merely turning cranks on the outside of the
case any adjustment from 5}5 to ssoc00000 In the relative resistances of the balancing
arms of the bolometric circuit can be easily effected. It is a principal advantage of
this arrangement that all the electrical circuit is in such compact quarters that
changes of temperature affect all parts almost alike. These have been the great causes
of disturbance of the deflections of the needle in the past, and the great obstacle to
an automatic registry, Their bad effects are so nearly eliminated now that apart
from the occasional need of a uniformity in the temperature of the prism, the
elaborate arrangements for keeping a uniform temperature in the observing room are
no longerneeded. No difficulty from drift or any disorder has ever been experienced
with this adjunct to the bolometric apparatus, and it is so much superior to any
earlier form that a duplicate piece has since been constructed for use in a research
on the radiation of the stars. Both were made at the Observatory shop and worked
perfectly from the very first trial, and they reflect great credit on Mr. Kramer, the
instrument maker.

Pyrheliometer.—Reference was made in last year’s report to the new form of absolute
pyrheliometer then being developed, consisting of a hollow chamber or ‘‘absolutely
black body”? in which the radiation is absorbed and from which the heat is continu-
ously removed by a liquid circulating about the walls of the chamber. This instru-
ment has been tried so successfully in an experimental form that steps are now being
taken to provide one for continuous automatic registration of the rate of solar radia-
tion. Its principal advantage as an absolute instrument depends on the fact that it
may be demonstrated that its indications are correct, for if a known quantity of heat
is supplied electrically to a coil within the chamber, this heat will reach the walls by
convection and radiation, and being then remoyed by the flowing liquid its amount
may be measured and compared with the known heating actually produced in the
coil. But it is obvious that the heat of solar rays, absorbed almost wholly upon the
wall of the chamber as they fall upon it, is much more likely to be accurately meas-
ured than the heat of the coil, which must first be chiefly communicated to the air
80 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

and thence to the wall of the chamber by convection. Accordingly, if the measured
heating from the coil agrees closely with the known heating applied to the coil,
much more closely will the measured heating from the solar rays represent the actual
rate of solar radiation.

Repeated trials have showed that the new form of pyrheliometer is capable of
accurate measurement of the heating of the coil, so that confidence is felt in its meas-
ures of the more advantageously applied solar radiation. Preliminary comparisons
with the new instrument seem to indicate that the mercury pyrheliometer hereto-
fore used as a standard at this Observatory reads somewhat too high.

Horizontal telescope.—Tests have been made to determine how completely the defects
of bad seeing are removed by churning the air column in the great horizontal tele-
scope, according to the plan initiated by you and mentioned in my last year’s report.
It has been found that though the churning is of great advantage, and generally indis-
pensable to any work whatever on the solar image, yet the definition of an artificial
star, whose beam travels twice through the whole tube, is far from perfect even with
churning. Much of the disturbed seeing is found to be caused by the heating of the
poorly protected tube in the sun, and a ventilated canvas tent has been ordered to
screen the tube thoroughly. Plans are also formed for making additional tests on
other methods of churning the air in the tube. Recalling the more perfect results
secured in experiments on a smaller scale in 1902, and the evident improvement of
definition obtained in the present large tube with the churning device now installed,
no doubt is felt that bad seeing within the tube itself may at length be wholly
removed.

A second serious defect in definition was found to be caused by warping of the
large plane mirrors of the coelostat, one of which is inclined forward and was at first
supported by a ring in front, while the other mirror, made originally for much less
severe work, was too thin to keep flat with an ordinary system of support. Both
mirrors have been almost entirely cured of these defects by the introduction of the
Ritchey supporting system composed of numerous balanced plates.¢ For the mirror
which is inclined forward, Mr. Ritchey’s original design had to be somewhat modi-
fied because the mirror must be stuck to the plates instead of resting on them by its
weight as in mirrors supported face up. We have heretofore employed here ground
brass plates to which the mirror is stuck with rubber cement, but it would probably
be better to make the plates slightly concave and connect them by flexible tubes to
a large reservoir from which the air is partially exhausted, so that the mirror would
be held to the plates by suction. But even as we have used it, the Ritchey system
has wonderfully improved the definition secured on the solar image. All the work
on these support systems was done in the Observatory shop.

A third serious defect in the definition of the horizontal telescope is due to the
tremor of the mirrors continually kept up by the city traffic, notwithstanding the
costly and massive piers on which the apparatus rests. Very great improvement in
steadiness has come from placing 14-inch rubber blocks under the coelostat and
under the concave mirrors.

Before the improvements noted, the solar focal image, 40 cm. in diameter, was an
ill-defined circle at a focal distance varying often 10 feet during a single day, and with
the sides at different focal distances from the top and bottom. Now the image is
pretty sharply defined, comes to focus on all sides in the same plane, and stays within
less than a foot of the same focus all day; while its wanderings rarely reach much
over a millimeter in amplitude. It is now possible to observe the absorption in the
solar envelope with accuracy at within 1 or 2 per cent of the radius from the sun’s
limb. But further improvements of the horizontal telescope are in progress, notably
the provision of well-protected shelters over the coelostat, the concave mirror, and

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 81

the spectro-bolometric apparatus, in place of the canvas shelters thus far used, and
with these, the improved churning device proposed, and the tent to shelter the tube
already ordered, it is confidently expected to have the horizontal telescope in very
satisfactory condition during the coming fiscal year.

3. Investigations.

Sun’s possible variability.—Notable progress has been made with the researches you
have initiated on the amount of solar radiation and its absorption in the solar envel-
ope and in our atmosphere. Within the last seventeen months three independent
kinds of evidence have been collected here, pointing toward the conclusion that the
radiation supplied by the sun may perhaps fluctuate within intervals of a few months
through ranges of nearly or quite 10 per cent, and that these fluctuations of solar
radiation may cause changes of temperature of several degrees centigrade nearly
simultaneously over the great continental areas of the world. Further evidence
must, however, be awaited to verify this important conclusion.

The three kinds of evidence referred to are as follows: First, on all favorable days
the ‘‘solar constant”’ of radiation outside our atmosphere has been determined here,
and changes of about 10 per cent in the values obtained have been found which can
not be attributed to known causes. Second, the solar image formed by the horizon-
tal telescope has been examined with the spectro-bolometer to determine the absorp-
tion of radiation within the solar envelope itself. If we grant for argument’s sake
that the rate of solar radiation outside our atmosphere fluctuates rapidly from time
to time, then as you have observed, the cause of this fluctuation can not reasonably
be a variability of the temperature of so immense a body as the sun itself, but must
rather be in a change in the absorption of a more or less opaque envelope surrounding
thesun. Accordingly the two researches I have mentioned are intimately associated,
for if we find a considerable increase in the rate of solar radiation outside our atmos-
phere we ought to find a corresponding decrease in the absorbing power of the solar
envelope.

Such is in fact one of the most notable results of the year’s work. In August,
September, and October, 1903, the observations of the ‘‘ solar constant’’ of radiation
indicated that the rate of radiation was about 10 per cent below that observed in
February, 1904. On the other hand measurements of the absorption of the solar
envelope indicated considerably less absorption in February, 1904, than in Septem-
ber, 1903.

The third kind of evidence of change in solar radiation is based on a study of the
temperature of the North Temperate Zone, as indicated by the Internationaler Deka-
denberichte published by the Kaiserliche Marine Deutsche Seewarte, and received
at the Observatory through the kindness of the Librarian of the United States
Weather Bureau. This publication gives the mean temperature at 8 a. m. for each
ten days at each one of about one hundred stations distributed over the principal
land areas of the North Temperate Zone, and for about ninety of these stations there
is also given the normal temperatures for the same ten-day periods, representing the
mean of many years. From these data there have been computed here the temper-
ature departures from the normal since January 1, 1903, and these are compared
graphically in the accompanying chart, Plate VII,“ with the measures of the solar
constant made in 1903. It will be seen that shortly after the observed fall of solar
radiation in March, 1903, a general fall of temperature occurred, which would be a
natural result of such a change. It has been shown here, in accordance with the
known laws of radiation, that 10 per cent fall in the solar radiation could not pro-
duce more than 7°.5 C. fall in terrestrial temperatures, and that several causes, notably

aShown also in your article on ‘‘A Possible Variation of the Solar Radiation,”

sm 1904——6
82 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the presence of the oceans, would prevent so great a change of temperature as this
resulting from a temporary diminution of solar radiation of only a few months’ dura-
tion. The observed fall of about 2°.5 C. in the mean temperature of the land areas
of the North Temperature Zone during April, 1903, seems to be therefore in good
accord with the observations of solar radiation.

Owing to the uncommon cloudiness of the first six months of 1904 few measures of
the ‘‘solar constant’? worthy to be compared with the series of 1903 have been
obtained, but taking the best of the measures it appears that high values of solar
radiation in February, 1904, and lower ones in the subsequent months are indicated,
as shown in Table 2, given below. This appears to be in general accord with the
mean temperatures observed over the North Temperate Zone, except that it seems
probable that the solar radiation was high in January as well as February, but the
lack of good observing weather prevented our recognition of it.

Forecasts of temperature.—If subsequent research shall confirm these indications
of a general parallelism between measures of solar radiation and terrestrial temper-
atures, we are now entering upon a new field of climate forecasting. But if such fore-
casts had to depend on measures of the solar radiation outside our atmosphere the
observing station should be removed from Washington to a more favorable situation,
for the experience of the last two years has shown that hardly a score of days in a
year are uniformly clear enough to allow even relatively good ‘‘solar constant”’
values to be obtained, and these good days are very unevenly distributed. Fortu-
nately, the distinct work which you have planned on the absorption of the solar
envelope, already mentioned, seems to promise a far easier method of forecasting,
which requires much less of constancy in the atmospheric conditions. Owing to the
preliminary nature of the installation of the great horizontal telescope as thus far
used, and to the fact that the great coelostat has been sent to the exposition at St.
Louis, only the single instance above mentioned of a comparison of the radiation
outside our atmosphere with solar absorption has yet been made; but if future work
shall confirm the general agreement between the indications afforded by the study
of the absorption of the solar envelope and those afforded by the measures of total
solar radiation, the significance of the result will be very great, for the bolometric
investigation of the solar image can be made at any time when the sun shines clear
for five minutes, by a method practically independent of the disturbances of our
own atmosphere, whereas the measures of total radiation require three hours of
unyarying transparency of the air. Accordingly the former measurements may be
made almost daily, and will, it is hoped, prove of great service in temperature
forecasts.

The effects of changes of the transparency of our own atmosphere are, perhaps, of
equal importance in temperature forecasts, and the recognition of these of course
depends on such spectro-bolometric measures as are involved in determinations of
the ‘‘solar constant.’’ Referring to my last year’s report, it will be remembered
that the earlier months of 1903 were found distinguished by more than the average
absorption of light in our atmosphere. In September, 1903, there was a marked
increase in transparency, so that in the latter months of the year the clearness was
almost as great as that of 1901-2. Of course as these studies are made only at Wash-
ington no general conclusions as to the transparency of the air at other stations can
safely be drawn. But if the clearing above mentioned was general it might perhaps
explain the upward tendency during the last months of 1903 of the curve of average
temperatures shown in Plate VII.

I venture to think the importance of studies of atmospheric absorption at other
stations would warrant observers elsewhere in taking up the spectro-bolometric work
involved in measures of the ‘‘solar constant.’’ Measures of the absorption of the
solar envelope, on the other hand, which require the provision of a great solar image,
would not necessarily be duplicated elsewhere.

RESULTS IN DETAIL.

Referring to my report of last year and to your recent publication @ on ‘‘A possible
variation of solar radiation’’ for further information, the following three tables sum-
marize the detailed results of the work already broadly discussed. Tables 1 and 2
are given in continuation of similar tables in last year’s report, and perhaps it needs
only to remark concerning them that the first six months of 1904 have proved uncom-
monly unfavorable to such studies as are here set forth, by reason of unusual cloudi-
ness. Owing to the bad atmospheric conditions there have been no days when
results as satisfactory as many of those of 1903 have been secured, and only two days’
work of 1904, February 11 and May 28, are regarded here as worthy of much confi-
dence. Taking the whole series together and comparing with the results of 1902-3,
it appears probable, however, that excepting during the month of February, the solar
radiation thus far in 1904 has been below the normal, although not so low as during
the latter half of 1905. The atmospheric transmission of 1903-4 seems to be generally
below that of 1902.

Mean value of direct atmospheric transmission.—Since Table 2 was prepared, which
was done without any reference to the subject of the present paragraph, at your
request the numbers in the fifth column haye been corrected to represent the solar
radiation at the earth’s surface for zenith sun, and those in the sixth column to
actual rather than mean solar distance. The ratio of the amount of heat which
reaches the earth’s surface for zenith sun to that outside the atmosphere is then
obtained by dividing the former values by the latter, and the mean result is 68 per
cent; whence the average absorption in our atmosphere is found to be 82 per cent,
which is the amount by which the sun’s radiation is diminished in a vertical trans-
mission to the surface of the earth. In this connection attention may be invited to
a paper published by you in the American Journal of Science, as long since as Sep-
tember, 1884, in which you have stated that observations made up to that time by
the best authorities gave a value of absorption for the zenith sun of about 20 per cent,
and that owing chiefly to the neglect of selective absorption, this nearly unanimous
value is nevertheless far inferior to the truth. The value just deduced from selective
absorption methods may be consided as a confirmation of your then statement.

You have elsewhere stated that the solar constant values obtained from high and
low sun measures at a low altitude station are likely to be below rather than above
the truth, and it may at least be admitted that there is a certain direct reflection of
radiation in passing from outer space into our atmosphere, differing as it does from
space in its optical density, and that a portion of radiation is here lost which can not
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 85

be measured at any single station high or low. Accordingly we must suppose that
our solar constant values are diminished from one or both the above causes, and
hence that the atmospheric absorption here estimated is too little rather than too
much.

Turning now to Table 3, which purports to give the vertical transmission for dif-
ferent wave lengths in the solar envelope, this depends but little on our own atmos-
phere, and much is hoped from a continuation of the work with the great horizontal
telescope on which these results rest. As this work is but newly developed here, a
short description of the procedure and assumptions involved in estimating the trans-
mission of the solar envelope will not be out of place. A spectro-bolometer, provided
with a slit only about 5 millimeters high, is set so that rays of a certain known wave
length reach the bolometer from the slit. Then with the prism stationary, but with
the automatic recording plate moving before the galvanometer as usual, the solar
image is allowed to drift by the earth’s diurnal motion across the slit of the spectro-
bolometer. Thus is produced a curve like those shown in Plate VIII, in which hori-
zontal distances from the center of the figure are proportional to distances along the
radius of the solar disc, and the height of the curve is proportional to the intensity of
the radiation of the given wave length at the corresponding point on the solar disc.
Apparently the figure would be ‘‘flat-topped,”’ if there was no absorption of the rays
by the solar envelope, and the curvature of the figure gives a rough indication of the
amount of the absorption.“ If the curve for a given day’s obseryation has steeper
sides than that of another, greater absorption would be indicated for the former day,
and such was the case for the two days’ work represented in Table 3.

But in order to. estimate quantitatively the change in absorption in the solar
envelope, it is necessary to make two assumptions whose truth can as yet only be
verified by the accuracy with which they represent the experimental results. First,
it may be supposed that the radiation of the absorbing envelope is negligible com-
pared with that of the photosphere, and that the absorption is, like that of the
earth’s atmosphere, represented by such an exponential formula as would apply to a
homogeneous atmosphere. Second, the thickness of the absorbing layer being
unknown, its relative thickness compared with the solar radius must be assumed in
order to compute the exponent of the formula.

In the first computations made here it was assumed that the thickness of the
absorbing envelope was very small as compared with the sun’s radius. Upon this

« You have suggested the possibility that owing to a columnar structure of the solar
surface we might find the limb of the sun brighter than the center of the dise in the
absence of an absorbing envelope, by reason of our seeing near the limb only the
supposedly brighter tops of the columns. No allowance for this is made in these
preliminary computations.
86 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

basis logarithmic plots@ prepared from the observed results showed great departures
from straight lines for all wave lengths, so that either the absorbing layer is not so
thin as first assumed, or the phenomenon is not a simple one of absorption. Acting
on the former supposition, it was found that when the absorption was assumed to
take place in a homogeneous stratum of about 45,000 miles thickness outside the
photosphere, or in other words, a rather thick stratum, yet well within the thick-
ness of the brighter part of the solar corona, very little curvature was exhibited in
the logarithmic plots at any wave lengths, or for any distance less than 99 per cent of
a radius from the center of the disc, or on either day of observation. Evidently the
assumption of homogeneity is a very strained one, hardly perhaps to be tolerated
even in a preliminary computation. I haye, however, given the transmission coeffi-
cients found in this way in Table 3. Estimates have been prepared of the amount
by which the total radiation of the sun would be increased were this envelope
wholly remoyed, but these are so far dependent upon the assumption referred to that
I defer their presentation for the present.

I wish, in closing, to particularly commend the zeal and ability with which Mr. F.
E. Fowle, jr., has aided in carrying through all the work above reported. Mr. Fowle
has also published ® during the year a valuable study of the absorption of water
vapor in the earth’s atmosphere, which summarizes measurements and computations
he has made from bolographie data collected here in the last three years. He finds
the transmission in each of the water-vapor bands studied to follow Bouguer’s expo-
nential law, but with coefficients of transmission varying greatly in amount for dif-
ferent bands and for different wave lengths in the same band. In passing from band
to band the absorption is generally greater the greater the wave length of the band,
but taking each band by itself the shorter wave lengths are most absorbed.

CONCLUSION.

The work of the year has been distinguished by useful improvements in the appa-
ratus of the Observatory, notably in the bolometer, the pyrheliometer, and the great
horizontal telescope. But chiefly it is marked by a great advance toward what you
have set as the far-off final goal of our efforts, namely, the establishment of a sound
basis for long range forecasting of climate, in the study of the solar radiation, and its
absorption in our atmosphere. The work of the year has made it seem possible,
though not yet certain, that fluctuations of the amount of solar radiation as great as
10 per cent may occur, and that independently of them there are marked changes of
the transparency of our atmosphere. Both causes must profoundly influence cli-
matic conditions, and both are being studied here with increasing facility, accuracy,
and success, by the aid of the spectro-bolometer. In short, it now seems not improb-
able that successful general forecasting of climate will be the not too far distant
outcome of our work.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX VI. ;

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN.

Str: I have the honor to present the following report on the operations of the
library of the Smithsonian Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1904.

The number of publications received and recorded in the accession books of the
Smithsonian deposit, Library of Congress, is as follows:

The accession numbers run from 452466460376.

A few of these publications have been temporarily held at the Institution for the use
of the staff, but the larger number have been sent direct to the Library of Congress.

About 355 boxes and 18 packages were used in transmitting the sendings to the
Library of Congress, and they are estimated to have amounted to the equivalent of
14,920 octavo volumes. This does not include a large number of public documents
presented to the Institution and transmitted without being recorded.

The selecting and sending to the Library of Congress of volumes and parts of vol-
umes belonging to the Smithsonian deposit which had been held at the Institution
and Museum in the past has been carried on in connection with the other work of
the library, and while a large number have been sent up there still remain from
last year many volumes ready for checking on the accession books. No separate
count has been kept of these sendings, and they are included in the above estimate.

The libraries of the Secretary, Office, and Astrophysical Observatory have received
during the year 337 volumes, pamphlets and charts, and 2,048 parts of volumes,
making a total of 2,385, and a grand total, including books for the Smithsonian
deposit, of 26,353.

The parts of serial publications that were entered on the card catalogue numbered
24,126. Six thousand slips for completed volumes were made, and about 510 cards
for new periodicals and annuals were added to the permanent record from the
periodical-recording desk.

Inaugural dissertations and academic publications were received from universities
at the following places:

Baltimore (Johns Hop- Halle. Paris.
kins). Heidelberg. Philadelphia (University
Basel. Helsingfors. of Pennsylvania).
Berlin. Ithaca (Cornell). Rostock.
Bern. Jena. St. Petersburg.
Bonn. Kiel. Toulouse.
Breslau. Konigsberg. Tubingen.
Erlangen. Lafayette (Purdue). Utrecht.
Freiburg. Leipsiec. Wurzburg.
Giessen. Louvain. Zurich.
Geneva. Marburg.
Greifswald. New York (Columbia).

88 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The plan inaugurated by the Secretary to effect new exchanges and to secure miss-
ing parts to complete sets, has been continued. In doing this 945 letters were written
and 285 new periodicals were added to the receipts, together with the completion
of 349 defective series. The sending out of postal cards for missing numbers has
been continued, and 105 were mailed, with the result that 53 missing parts were
received in response.

In the reference room the members of the scientific staff and others have consulted
the transactions and proceedings of the learned societies; and in the reading room 20
bound volumes of periodicals and 2,900 separate periodicals were taken out for con-
sultation. The sections maintained in the Institution are the Secretary’s library,
Office library, and the Employee’s library, together with the sectional libraries of
the Astrophysical Observatory, Aerodromics, International Exchanges, and Law
Reference.

At the close of last year 64 volumes in the Astrophysical Observatory library had
just been completed and made ready for binding, and in the early part of this year
they were bound.

The collection of books in the library at the National Zoolgical Park has had an
addition, by purchase, of 15 works on the life and habits of animals and birds, and
one or two exchanges of periodical publications have been effected by the Institution
for its special benefit.

The employees have availed themselves of the privileges of the Employee’s
library, and 3,220 books were borrowed, that number being a considerable increase
over last year. The library has had an addition, by purchase, of 37 new books, and
120 magazines were bound. The sending of a collection of books, numbering about
40, each month to the National Zoological Park has been continued with such success
that an arrangement was made in the early part of June to make a similar sending
to the Bureau of American Ethnology, and a case containing about 26 volumes was
sent.

The increase in the number of books presented by General de Peyster, for the
Watts de Peyster collection Napoléon Buonaparte, created the necessity for more
shelf room, and 22 cases were constructed to hold the additions to this collection
that have been received during the last two years. These cases were placed against
the north and south walls of the lower corridor of the office wing of the Institution.
General de Peyster continues to add many valuable volumes to the collection,
together with several bronze busts. There have also been received from him oil
paintings and many historical relics of the colonial period, which have been placed
in the United States National Museum for exhibition.

INTERNATIONAL CATALOGUE OF SCIENTIFIC LITERATURE.

The work of the International Catalogue has been continued under the auspices of
the Institution, and the addition to the allotment for this year has made possible the
increase of nearly 50 per cent in the total number of references sent to the central
bureau at London. The following table gives the number in detail:

All of the first annual issue of the catalogue has now been published and distrib-
uted, together with the following volumes of the second annual issue: Astronomy,
Bacteriology, Mechanics, Physics, Mathematics, Mineralogy, and Physical Geogra-
phy. This country still Jeads in the number of subscribers to the catalogue.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 89

In the near future an effort will be made looking to a more complete cooperation
of the authors and publishing bodies in the United States with this Regional Bureau
by requesting immediate notice and subject abstract of new publications coming
within the scope of the International Catalogue.

The international convention, which has the power of revision of the classification
schedules, will meet in London in July, 1905, and has asked for suggestions from
this country through the Smithsonian Institution.

MUSEUM LIBRARY.

The National Museum library has received a gift from Prof. Otis Tufton Mason,
in addition to the one of some years ago, of about 2,000 pamphlets, separates, and
bound quarto volumes, mostly on anthropological subjects. A special book plate
has been provided for this collection. The Museum has also received from Dr.
Edward L. Greene his entire botanical library, which has been placed on deposit
for a period of ten years in connection with his botanical collection. The conditions
regarding Doctor Greene’s library are that the books shall be accessible on the same
terms as other books in the Museum library, with the exception that they are not
to be lent to persons outside the District of Columbia or abroad without Doctor
Greene’s consent. In case of the death of Doctor Greene during the time specified,
the library becomes the property of the United States.

In the Museum library there are now 20,548 bound volumes and 35,950 unbound
papers. The additions during the year consisted of 1,504 books, 3,187 pamphlets,
and 700 parts of volumes. There were catalogued 938 books, of which 40 belonged
to the Smithsonian deposit, and 2,130 pamphlets, of which 70 belonged to the Smith-
sonian deposit, and 11,520 parts of periodicals, of which 1,887 belonged to the Smith-
sonian deposit. In the accession book 1,387 volumes, 2,187 pamphlets, and 629 parts
of volumes were recorded. The number of cards added to the authors’ catalogue
were 4,090, which does not include 2,855 cards for books and pamphlets recatalogued.

In connection with the entering of periodicals 171 memoranda were made report-
ing volumes and parts missing in the sets, together with a few titles of publications
which were not represented in the library. The result of this work was the com-
pleting, or partly filling vp, of 70 sets of periodicals.

The number of books, pamphlets, and periodicals borrowed from the general
library amounted to 26,456, including 5,679, which were assigned to the sectional
libraries.

There has been no change in the sectional libraries established in the Museum,
and they are as follows:

Administration. Fishes. Paleobotany.
Administrative assis- Geology. Parisites.

tant. History. Photography.
Anthropology. Insects. Prehistoric archeology.
Biology. Mammals. Reptiles.
Birds. Marine invertebrates. Stratigraphic paleontology.
Botany. Materia medica. Superintendent.
Children’s room. Mesozoic fossils. Taxidermy.

APPENDIX VIII.

REPORT OF THE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTI-
TUTION AND NATIONAL MUSEUM, LOUISIANA PURCHASE EXPO-
SITION, ST. LOUIS, MO., 1904.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following report on the Louisiana
Purchase Exposition held at St. Louis, Mo., from April 30 to December 1, 1904,
inclusive :

An act of Congress approved June 28, 1902, provided for a Government
exhibit to be made by the several Executive Departments, bureaus, and other
organizations, including the Smithsonian Institution and National Museum,
under the management of a Government board. The sum of $800,000 was
appropriated for this exhibit, and for buildings the sum of $450,000.

The main Government building, containing a floor space of 102,000 square
feet, was located on an eminence at the east end of the Exposition grounds.
Adjoining it was a smaller building for the aquarium and other exhibits of
the United States Commission of Fish and Fisheries, and at a short distance
farther south was erected a large cage for the exhibits of the National Zoolog-
ical Park. <A building and inclosure for the exhibit of the Life-Saving Service
were located in another part of the grounds.

Congress subsequently appropriated the sum of $100,000 for an exhibit of
the agricultural and experiment stations and colleges of mechanic arts. This
exhibit was placed in the education building.

The principal embellishment of the interior of the Government building was
a reproduction of the Statue of Liberty, by Crawford, which surmounts the
dome of the Capitol. The replica was made in staff by Mr. U. 8. J. Dunbar
from the original model in the rotunda of the National Museum.

The space in the Government building assigned to the Smithsonian Institution
and National Museum comprised about 16,500 square feet, having a frontage on
the main aisle of a little over 200 feet and a depth of about 77 feet. It was
located on the south side of the building, beginning at the rotunda and adjoin-
ing the space of the Post-Office Department at the farther end.

One end of this space was occupied by a specially designed pavilion 77 feet
long and 25 feet wide, containing the exhibits of the Smithsonian Institution
proper (including the Hodgkins fund), the Bureau of International Exchanges,
and the Astrophysical Observatory, as well as a representation of the Children’s
Room in the Smithsonian building at Washington. The remainder of the space
was occupied by the exhibit of the National Museum and that of the Bureau of
American Ethnology.

In addition to the space in the Government building, an area outside, about
100 by 300 feet and lying 100 or 200 yards south of the building, as already
stated, was assigned to the exhibit of the National Zoological Park, consisting
of a large flying cage for birds. Y

A large coelostat, which constituted a part of the exhibit of the Astrophysical
Observatory, was also placed outside the Government building, about 50 feet
south, opposite the east end of the Smithsonian space, a brick pier being erected
as a foundation.

The allotment of funds to the Institution and Museum from the appropriation
for a Government exhibit was $110,000,

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION PROPER.

‘Or

The exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution occupied a space of about 625
square feet in the central court of the pavilion mentioned above. <A special
table case was placed in the middle of this court in which were displayed
copies of the History of the First Half Century of the Smithsonian Institution,
the seal of the Institution, and several Hodgkins medals. <A continuous seat
extended along the east wall of the court, above which were displayed two
portraits of James Smithson, copies of his scientific papers, a cast of the
bronze tablet which was placed on his tomb at Genoa, Italy, and pictures of the
tomb itself. Adjoining these objects was a series of photographs of the chan-
cellors and regents of the Institution and portraits of the secretaries. On the
south wall of the court was exhibited a portrait of Thomas G. Hodgkins and
circulars and papers relating to the Hodgkins fund. <A portion of the north
wall of the court was occupied by an exhibit from the Bureau of International
Exchanges, consisting of a large statistical chart, showing its operations for
a period of fifty-three years. A complete series of the publications of
the Institution and all its dependencies, comprising 278 volumes, was also
exhibited in this space. Hung in midair over the pavilion was the quarter-size
model of the Langley gas-driven aerodrome of 1904. The Langley steam-driven
nerodrome of 1896 was also hung in midair about 30 feet in front of the former.
Three enlarged photographs of the steam-driven aerodrome when in motion
were hung on the side-walls of the pavilion.

The Children’s Room occupied the portion of the pavilion abutting on the
main aisle. In shape, size, and character of fittings and exhibits, the room
was, as nearly as possible, a replica of the original room in the Smithsonian
building. Around the walls were specially constructed low cases of light-
colored wood, while in the center of the room, on a low stand, was an aquarium,
and near by a cage of living song-birds. A portion of the wall-case was oc-
cupied by birds of interest to children, among which were the following:
Familiar birds of the United States; birds-of-paradise, and others noted for
their brilliancy of coloring: interesting water-birds, such as the eider duck,
lapwing, avocet, European stork, penguin, barnacle goose; other noteworthy
birds, such as the apteryx, rook, jackdaw, and lyre bird, the harpy eagle, the
condor, and examples of the largest and smallest owls. In this room were
also exhibited the duckbill, or platypus, and the spiny ant-eater, peculiar
egg-laying mammals from Australia. ‘To illustrate how animals are protected
by their color and form, or “ how creatures hide,” was shown a weasel in
the white winter cont on snow-covered ground, and another in the brown
summer coat amid dead leaves; also an underwing moth on bark, and such
peculiar insects as the katydid and walking-stick. Curious forms of life were
shown in the finger sponge, the glass sponge. the organ-pipe coral, and the
sea-horse, as well as brilliantly colored parrot fishes. The room also contained
a small exhibit of useful minerals. In the south and east part of the wall-
case was a collection of beautiful and interesting shells, including those of the
giant elam, Tridacna. In another part of the room were some comparative
exhibits, such as a cast of the egg of the extinct bird Epyornis and the egg
of a hummingbird, representing the largest and smallest eggs. Groups of
brilliant North American and South American butterflies, and of familiar
forms, arranged to show life-histories, were also exhibited.

As a part of the exhibit of the Smithsonian Institution, may be mentioned
a descriptive pamphlet of 35 pages and 12 plates, for gratuitous distribution
to the public, being an account of the Smithsonian Institution, its origin, his
tory, objects, and achievements.
102 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

As already mentioned, this exhibit occupied the south court of the main
pavilion, which could be entered only from the court devoted to the Smith-
sonian proper. At previous expositions, the exhibit of this Bureau consisted
of publications, charts of the infra-red spectrum, and other charts relating to
astrophysics, some small pieces of apparatus, and a series of transparent
photographs of solar eclipses and of sun spots. All these objects were exhibited
at St. Louis, and in addition a working exhibit was prepared. This consisted,
first, of a bolometer connected with a galvanometer, on which was attached
a mirror which threw a spot of light on a horizontal scale, so that any change
of temperature in the bolometer would be transmitted to the galvanometer
and the spot could be seen to move. This change of temperature could be
brought about by a visitor simply holding his hand over a hole in the case
in which the bolometer was placed. The whole exhibit was carefully labeled,
and there was scarcely a moment during the day when visitors could not be
found watching the workings of this delicate instrument for measuring slight
changes in temperature.

The other moving exhibit consisted of a large two-mirrored coelostat, specially
constructed for this exposition, which, as before mentioned, was located about
30 feet south of the Government building, opposite the court in which the astro-
physical exhibit was made. ‘This coelostat on sunny days reflected a large beam
of sunlight through a window into a dark room which occupied over half of the
astrophysical court. Part of the beam of sunlight was thrown through a tele-
scope, which in turn threw a large image of the sun on the north wall of the dark
room. At scarcely any time during the seven months of the exposition was
the visitor unable to find large sun-spots, or groups of spots, on this image.
Another portion of the beam of light was reflected by a series of mirrors to a
grating of speculum metal, which in turn threw a brilliant solar spectrum
around the east and south walls of the dark room. To make this exhibit more
intelligible to the public, a descriptive illustrated pamphlet, written by the
director, was distributed gratuitously to those desiring copies.

NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

At previous expositions the exhibit of the National Zoological Park has con-
sisted of pictures of the buildings and paddocks in the park, with the addition,
usually, of a small model of the park itself. It was felt that such a representa-
tion of this Bureau at the St. Louis Exposition would be inadequate, and, after
a careful consideration of possibilities, an extensive exhibit of birds, placed in
a cage large enough to permit them to fly about, was decided upon. The cage
was 228 feet long, 84 feet wide, and 50 feet high, and was erected by the Super-
vising Architect of the Treasury Department at the request of the representa-
tive of the Institution from the appropriation for Government buildings, at a
cost of about $17,500. This cage, which was designed by the superintendent of
the park, was probably the largest of its kind ever built. It was traversed by
au central arched passageway, open to the public, extending the entire length of
the cage. As already mentioned, the cage was situated 100 or 200 yards south
of the main building, in a small valley, amid trees, several of which were in-
closed by the cage. It was divided into two portions by a longitudinal parti-
tion. In the north half were confined the larger birds, among which were
gulls, three species of wild geese, trumpeter swans, Cuban flamingos, roseate
spoonbills, four species of ibis, three species of heron, demoiselle cranes, white
pelicans, brown pelicans, Huropean pelicans, and other birds, such as darters,

eS a a mL
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 108

cormorants, curassows, and vultures. In the south half of the cage were
placed the smaller birds, such as quails, partridges, doves, ducks, canaries,
Ienglish blackbirds, jays, thrushes, Javan sparrows, bullfinches, goldfinches,
weaver birds, linnets, cardinals, orioles, ete. The exhibit of the National
Zoological Park proved one of the most attractive in the exposition grounds,
and was surrounded by visitors at all times during the day. The exhibit re-
quired the constant attention of two men. The records show that the large
fish-eating birds consumed an average daily amount of 40 pounds of fish and 5
pounds of chopped meat, while for the smaller birds large quantities of fresh
vegetables, grains, and other seeds were required.

BUREAU OF INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES.

It will be appreciated that the work of the Bureau of International Exchanges
does not lend itself to exhibition by material objects. ‘The exhibit at St. Louis
consisted of a large chart showing the number of packages transmitted each
year from the establishment of the bureau to the present time. There were also
shown photographs of the offices of the bureau in the Smithsonian building. In
order to explain more fully the functions and operations of the bureau a small
descriptive pamphlet was prepared, copies of which were given to those desiring
them.

THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The exhibit of the Bureau of American Ethnology was for the most part
incorporated with that of the department of anthropology of the United States
National Museum, both of which were under the direction of Mr. W. H. Holmes,
chief of the bureau. This exhibit was chiefly illustrative of the symbolic art,
decorative designs, and heraldry of the American Indians, and represented the
researches of the ethnologists of the bureau. Included with it was a series of
objects representing the archeology of the West Indies. These exhibits were
installed in recesses in the front wall of the Smithsonian pavilion, in a portion
of the south wall case. and in two large floor cases. Further notice of this
exhibit and of the special significance of the various objects shown will be found
on pages 47 to 49 of this report. A considerable amount of field-work was done
in this connection by Messrs. Fewkes, Swanton, and Mooney, and Mrs. Steven-
son, ethnologists of the bureau, notice of which will be found in the place
mentioned.

TLE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

As at all previous expositions, the largest display was made by the National
Museum, owing to its special function and its opportunities for making large
exhibits. The floor-space not occupied by the bureaus already mentioned was
roughly divided into three portions, one devoted to each of the three executive
departments of the Museum—namely, anthropology, biology, and geology.

The Department of Anthropology.—This exhibit was planned by Mr. W. H.
Holmes, chief of the Bureau of Ethnology, assisted by the curators of the
department of anthropology. The main theme of this exhibit was the esthetic
achievements of the native American peoples. In conjunction therewith, some
of the works of art of ancient civilizations of the Old World were shown.

The carvings of the American Indians were represented by such objects as
stone and wooden masks, carved boxes, benches, horns, weapons, ete. These
were installed in a special black floor-case. The larger carvings included four
house-panels of the Tlinkit Indians and two large house-posts of the Haida
Indians, The former were placed on the wall and the latter on the floor. To
104 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

these were added two large totem poles, which, owing to lack of space, as well
as on account of their large size, were set up out-of-doors, in front of the Indian
school building, at the opposite end of the exposition grounds.

The exhibit of textile arts represented the werk of tribes of the Northwest,
those of the Pueblo region, and the Indians of Central and South- America.
Among the latter were examples of the beautiful woven garments found in the
ancient cemetery at Ancon, Peru. In a portion of one of the cases containing
the textile arts were specimens of the closely-related feather work of the Ameri-
can Indians, comprising headdresses, wristbands, and other ornaments. This
exhibit was installed in two special floor-cases.

The ceramic art was represented by various pieces of pottery of the Indians
of North, Central, and South America, which were displayed in a special floor
ease, while around the tep of the Smithsonian pavilion and the top of that part
of the wall cases devoted to the Bureau of American Ethnology were placed as
decorative objects 29 specimens of Indian pottery.

Another special case was devoted to the basketry of various Jndian tribes
and contained about 50 baskets of different forms and patterns.

A special floor-case contained objects representing the sculpture of the Ameri-
ean Indians, such as idols, yokes, carved animals, tablets, weapons, celts,
metates, pipes, ete. Other objects of sculpture, placed on separate pedestals.
were a cast of a colossal figure of an Aztec deity from the ancient City of
Mexico, a cast of a statue of.a Mayan deity from the ruined city of Quirigua,
Guatemala, and a cast of an ancient statue from Costa Rica. <A sculptured
altar-panel from an ancient Mayan temple and ceremonial subjects in relief
from a temple at Menche, Mexico, were placed on large screens.

The architecture of the American Indians was represented by complete resto-
rations, on a reduced seale, of five of the ruined temples of the Aztecs of Mexico,
namely, the 'Temple of Nochicaleco at Morales, the “Temple of the Cross” at
Palenque, the ‘“* House of the Governor” at Uxmal, the ‘‘ Temple of the Col-
uimns ” at Mitla, and the * Castle” at Chichen-Itza, each placed on a large sepa-
rate pedestal. ‘These temples were arranged in a group in the center of the
space of the department of anthropology. They were built under the imme-
diate direction of Mr. W. H. Holmes by Delancy Gill, architect, and Messrs.
H. W. Hendley and W. H. Gill, sculptors. On two large screens near these tem-
ples were hung photographs and drawings of the ruined cities in which the
originals of these buildings were found.

In the section assigned to anthropology was exhibited an historical collection
made by the Society of the Daughters of the American Revolution, whose
archives and collections are, by provision of law, deposited in the Smithsonian
Institution. A picture of the Continental Hall wow being erected in Washington,
and portraits of the presidents-general of the society were also shown, together
with a small series of objects of historical interest belonging to the Society of
the Children of the American Revolution. <A portrait of Baron von Closen was
also exhibited.

Department of Blology.—The exhibit of this Department was planned by Dr.
F. W. True, head curator, assisted by Mr. F. A. Lucas and others of the
Museum staff. While illustrating the methods of preparing, arranging, install-
ing, and labeling zoological collections employed in the National Museum, it was
designed also with a view of displaying some of the largest, most striking, and
most beautiful forms of animal life now existing. On account of the character
of the exposition, the exhibit was given a world-wide scope. Many objects were
taken from the permanent exhibition-series, and others obtained and prepared
especially for this exhibit, Botanical exhibits were omitted for the reason that

ENTRANCE TO ST. Louis EXHIBIT OF THE ASTROPHYSICAL OBSERVATORY, SHOWING
TRANSPARENCIES OF THE TOTAL ECLIPSE OF THE SUN AS OBSERVED AT WADES-

BORO, N. C., 1900.
REPORT OF THE SECTETARY. 105

the botanical division of the department consists at present practically only of
an herbarium, the collections of which it was thought could not be made inter-
esting to the general public.

The most striking feature of the exhibit at St. Louis was the cast of 2 sulphur-
bottom whale, the largest known animal. This large piece was suspended over
the central aisle of the Museum space. Placed on the floor near it, was a
skeleton of the same species. The cast was obtained through the courtesy of
the Cabot Steam Whaling Company, and the skeleton by gift from the Colonial
Manufacturing Company, at Balena, Hermitage Bay, Newfoundland, by Messrs.
PF. A. Lucas, William Palmer, and J. W. Scollick, who made a special expedition
to Newfoundland in the spring of 1904 to secure the material.

Another prominent feature of the exhibit of this department comprised a
group of 20 game mammals from all parts of the world, namely: From North
America, a black bear, a polar bear, an Alaska moose, a Mexican sheep, a Green-
Jand musk-ox, a specimen of Osborn’s caribou, and an Olympic elk; from Africa,
a giraffe, a zebra, a two-horned rhinoceros, a white-tailed gnu, a hippopotamus,
and a lion; from Asia, a tiger, a sambar stag, a specimen of Marco Polo’s
sheep, an axis deer; from Europe, a chamois, a moufflon or wild sheep, and a
Norway elk. Each was placed on a separate pedestal and the whole group
inclosed by brass railing.

A small but very popular part of the exhibit of the department was a select
collection of birds’ eggs, installed in two special table-cases. In one was a
series showing variations in size, form, color, and texture, and in the number
laid at one time. Among these eggs was one of Hpyornis maximus, an extinct
bird of Madagascar, whose eggs are the largest known. By a fortunate coin-
cidence, an opportunity occurred to purchase a remarkably fine example for
addition to this series. Other interesting eggs in this case were those of the
apteryx, the great auk, three species of ostrich, several species of tinamou, and
the ruby-throated hummingbird. In the second case was placed a very complete
collection of the eggs of North American birds of prey.

The main exhibit of birds was installed in four 30-inch screen-cases, and con-
sisted of a series of pheasants especially noteworthy for the brillianey of their
plumage, such as Lady Amherst’s pheasant, fire-back pheasants, tragopans, ete.
Three species of peafowl! were included in this series, each represented by a male
and a female. Among the other birds exhibited was a pair of the rare and
curious Harris’s cormorant, from the Galapagos Islands, a species incapable of
flight owing to its dwarfed wings and to the soft, flexible nature of the primary
feathers. Installed in a special floor case was a group of hoaezins, Opistho-
comus hoaczin, showing the life-history of the species. This material of group
consisted of 4 adults, 3 nestlings, 2 half-grown young, 2 nests, 2 eggs, together
with bushes and other accessories, and was specially collected for exhibition at
St. Louis. The young of this singular bird possess well-developed claws on the
first and second digits of the wing, by means of which they climb from branch
to branch with comparative ease.

Reptiles were represented by mounted specimens of the American crocodile
and alligator, which were placed near one another, so that the differences
between these two largest of American reptiles could be readily seen. In addi-
tion, two special cases of snakes were exhibited; one contained a reticulated
python, probably the largest species of snake in existence, and the other a small
series of especially neteworthy poisonous and harmless snakes, such as the
cobra, the rattlesnake, the harlequin snake, and the king snake.

A unique exhibit of unusual significance and interest consisted of a series of
‘models of deep-sea fishes, installed in two short sections of the wall-case.
106 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

These models were based chiefly on specimens in the National Museum, from
the rich collections of the U. S. Fish Commission steamer Albatross. Owing to
the small size of the originals, it was necessary to enlarge the models so that
the extraordinary modifications and fantastic appearance of these inhabitants
of the deep-sea could be appreciated by the public. Accompanying this series
was a diagram showing the great depths at which these peculiar forms are
found, in comparison with the other fishes of the sea. The following species
were represented: Deep-sea chimera (Harriotta raleighana), hatchet fish
(Sternoptyx diaphana), rag fish (Acrotus witloughbyi), pelican fish (Gastros-
tomus bairdii), snipe eel (Nemichthys scolopaceus), lesser angler (Cryptopsaras
couesii), viper fish (Chauliodus sioani), Bathypterois quadrifilis, great swal-
lower (Chiasmadon niger), deep sea gurnard (Peristedion miniatum), and the
species Caulolepis longidens. Malacosteus choristodactylus, and Malacosteus
niger.

Invertebrates were represented by two series of specimens, installed in stand-
ard Museum unit boxes, arranged in frames along the wall. The first was a syn-
optie series of invertebrates displaying the principal groups, the more important
forms in each group, their structure, and, so far as possible, important or inter-
esting features in their life histories. | This series was designed especially to show
methods of Museum installation. In two sections of the wall case near this
series was a special display of fan corals, and another of crabs. The second
principal series of invertebrates consisted of about 500 species of butterflies and
moths from all parts of the world, selected with special reference to beauty or
singularity of color and markings or large size. Hach species was represented
by a pair of specimens, making about 1,000 in all. The specimens were remark-
able for their perfection, and the whole series was, as night be imagined, hardly
to be surpassed in briiliancy.

Department of Geology.—The exhibit of this department was planned by Dr.
George P. Merrill, head curator, assisted by members of his staff, and embraced
four main groups: First, an exhibit of minerals; second, one of meteorites ;
third, of invertebrate fossils, and, fourth, of vertebrate fossils.

(1) A systematic series of minerals was installed in eight standard 15-inch
Museum cases. This series was remarkably complete, and the various species
were represented by specimens of the largest size. A complete and particularly
fine series of all the known forms of silica occurring in nature was shown in a
special 36-inch screen case. This included examples of agates, jasper, wood-
opal, ete. In a companion case was exhibited a similar series comprising all
the known natural forms of calcium carbonate, such as Iceland spar and other
caleites, stalagmites, limestone, pearls, etc. In proximity to the silica exhibit
was displayed one of the largest masses of amethyst crystals known, and a
giant quartz erystal. The amethyst crystals weighed about a quarter of a ton.
Another mineral exhibit consisted of a series of Cones from hot springs, showing
the deposit of crystals on the interior.

(2) Meteorites: Special pains were taken to assemble an exhibit of meteor-
ites worthy of the occasion. To this end endeavors were made to obtain
representations of the largest known examples. Through the courtesy of Com-
mander R. E. Perry, U. S. N., casts were secured of the three great masses from
Greenland, known as the ‘ Peary meteorites,’ and with the concurrence of the
Mexican Government and the friendly assistance of José G. Aguilera a cast of
the Bacubirito meteorite was also secured. <A special trip to Mexico for the pur-
pose of obtaining a mold was undertaken by Dr. George P. Merrill and Mr. Wil-
liam Palmer, with entirely satisfactory results. A cast was also made of the

Irwin-Ainsa or Tucson meteorite, in the National Museum. These great casts,
which include representations of the largest masses which are known to have
fallen from the sky, were assembled near the rotunda of the building, and pre-
sented a most impressive appearance. Adjacent to the casts was installed a
series of actual specimens of meteorites and sections of specimens, and a chart
showing the distribution of known meteoric falls, and pictures of falling
meteorites.

(38) Vertebrate fossils: The most popular feature of this exhibit was the life-
size restoration of an armored dinosaur, known as Stegasaurus ungulatus,
based on remains from Colorado and Wyoming. The skeleton of the horned
dinosaur, 7'riceratops, previously exhibited at Buffalo and Charleston, was also
shown at St. Louis. Standing side by side, in order to show their similarity in
size and details of structure, were exhibited the skeleton of an American mas-
todon and that of an African elephant. The skeleton and the cast of an egg
of one of the moas (extinct birds from New Zealand) were exhibited in a special
‘vase. Other vertebrate fossils were represented by specimens on the slabs of
stone in which they were found, embracing fossil fishes, fossil fish-like and
crocodile-like reptiles, as well as a very complete specimen of thé remarkable
flying reptile, Rhamphorhynchus, which shows the impress of the wing and
tail membranes in the rock.

(4) Invertebrate fossils: 'Mhese were installed in a section of the wall-case,
and comprised cephalopod and other mollusks, including a fine series of ammon-
ites, and crustaceans, crinoids, echinoderms, and corals.

(5) Fossil palm: An opportunity to obtain an exceptionally fine Tertiary
fossil palm, Latanites vicentinus, having occurred during the preparations for
the exposition, the specimen was purchased and added to the geological exhibit.
It was obtained in Monte Bolka, province of Verona, Italy.

Dr. F. W. True, representative for the Institution and Museum on tne Goy-
ernment board, was also chairman of the committee on installation and decora-
tion. Dr. M. W. Lyon, jr., was chief special agent.
