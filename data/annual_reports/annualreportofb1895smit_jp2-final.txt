JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS OF
THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

ANNUAL MEETING OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

JANUARY 23, 1895.
In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents, adopted

_ January 8, 1890, by which its stated annual meeting occurs on the fourth

Wednesday in January, the Board met to-day at 10 o’clock a. m.

Present: The Chancellor (the Hon. M. W. Fuller) in the chair, the
Hon. J. 8. Morrill, the Hon. George Gray, the Hon. Joseph Wheeler,
the Hon. R. R. Hitt, Dr. Henry Coppée, the Hon. J. B. Henderson,
and the Secretary, Mr. S. P. Langley.

Excuses for nonattendance were read from Dr. William Preston
Johnston, on account of illness; from the Hon. S. M. Cullom, on account
of a domestic affliction, and from Dr. Andrew D. White, on account of
absence in Europe.

At the Chancellor’s suggestion, the Secretary read in abstract the
minutes of the last meeting, which were approved.

The Secretary stated that the term of Dr. Andrew D. White as
Regent of the Institution having expired on February 15, 1894, he was
reappointed by joint resolution of Congress, approved by the President
March 19, 1894.

The Secretary announced the death, on September 4, 1894, of Dr.
Welling, chairman of the Executive Committee.

On motion, the Chancellor appointed Senator Henderson and the
Secretary a committee to prepare suitable resolutions expressing the
Board’s sense of loss, and the committee presented the following:

Whereas the members of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution
have been called upon to mourn the death of their esteemed colleague, the late

James C. Welling, LL. D., president of the Columbian University, who has long
been interested in the welfare of the Institution, and who for many years has been

.a Regent and chairman of its Executive Committee,

Resolved, That the Board of Regents feels deep regret in the loss of one whose
long and distinguished career of public usefulness, especially in the promotion of
institutions for higher education, commanded their respect, and whose personal
character and unselfish devotion to the highest ideals of scholarship and citizen-
ship, their sincere admiration.

Resolved, That in the death of President Welling the Smithsonian Institution has
suffered the irreparable loss of an earnest friend, a wise and judicious counselor,
and one who was preeminently an exponent of its time-honored policy; and the
Board of Regents a friend and associate whom they valued most highly. |

xXI
XII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

Resolved, That these resolutions be recorded in the Journal of the Proceedings of
the Board, and that the Secretary be requested to send a copy of them to the family
of their departed associate and friend, in token of sympathy in this common
affliction.

Resolved, That the Secretary be requested to prepare a eulogy of President Welling
for insertion in the Journal of the Board of Regents.

Dr. Coppée said that he had been longer associated with Dr.Welling
than any other member of the Board, since 1884, and particularly as a
member of the Executive Committee with him, and as he had for Dr.
Welling a very high esteem, he thought it proper to say a word in this
connection. Dr. Welling was one of the most valuable citizens of
Washington, to whom was confided many trusts, among them the
presidency of the Columbian University, and the chairmanship of the
Executive Committee of this Institution, and he did well everything
that was confided to him. He was aman pure in thought, honest in
purpose and action, and intelligent in judgment. He held a ready pen,
and how polished his public utterances were, all here would remember
who had heard him when he presented papers and other matters before
this Board.

Dr. Coppée added that Dr. Welling was cautioned by his friends that
he worked too hard, and instanced the fact that at the last meeting
which he attended, in May, he announced his purpose to write a work
with reference to his favorite subject of anthropology, when Senator
Henderson, now present, said to him: “The best thing that you can do
is to consider one individual of the species of ‘anthropos,’ and very care-
fully, at this time. You are the ‘man;’ take care of yourself.” It was
a grave pleasantry. It was good counsel, but it came too late, for Dr.
Welling was injured by the hard work that he did. In him is lost
a man who was preeminently excellent in counsel, whether to the
Board or in private, but he would leave it to the Secretary to speak of
him further.

Senator Henderson spoke of his long and intimate acquaintance with
Dr. Welling and expressed his admiration for him as a citizen and as
an officer of the Institution.

The Secretary then said:

LT have lost in Dr. Welling a personal friend, but I only have to speak of him now
in his relationship to this Institution—an institution whose conservative character
has been partly due to good fortune in the presence and advice of such men.

Dr. Welling was one who possessed, beyond anyone else, what may be called the
tralitions of the Institution; and though these were not of course his exclusive
property, in this respect, as in others, his loss can not be supplied.

The rules of conduct which have been laid down by the Regents and by the Sec-
retaries who have administered them are not so much derived from a priori views
as they are the outgrowth of accumulated experience; and this experience, it has
been thought, is in part, perhaps, due to the exceptionally long incumbencies of
members of the Board as compared with ordinary tenures of office here, and to
the continuity of the knowledge of its activities, as illustrated in the case of this
departed friend.

James Clark Welling, at the time of his death, September 4, 1894, was nearly 70
years of age. Descended from New England colonial ancestors, a native of one of
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XIII

the Middle States,! in early manhood a teacher in the South, and for nearly half a
century a resident of the national capital, he was an American of the noblest type,
free from sectional bias, personifying the best traits and tendencies of the nation,
loyal to the traditions and aspirations of its founders.

He was graduated in 1844 from the College of New Jersey, studied law, and was
admitted to the bar, but soon afterwards entered upon the profession of journal-
ism. He always retained, however, a strong inclination for the study of constitu-
tional and international law, and of politics, and his interest in public affairs was
greatly stimulated by his connection for fifteen years with the most important of
Washington journals, at that time national in its influence. He became the literary
editor of the National Intelligencer in 1850, and was its managing editor throughout
the entire period of the civil war. In this capacity he had the privilege of personal
acquaintance with all our public men, and confidential access to many of them,
including Lincoln, Seward, and Stanton.

In later life his attention was given chiefly to educational work. For a time
president of St. John’s College, Maryland, and later professor of belles-lettres at
Princeton, he was, in 1870, recalled to Washington to become president of the
Columbian University, an institution founded fifty years before, in the hope that it
might fulfill the desire of Washington, Barlow, and Adams, that a seat of liberal
learning should exist at the capital. Dr. Welling was led to accept this position by
the urgency of the philanthropist Corcoran and the advice of Henry, both of whom
were influenced by the hope of having with them one of the founders of a national
university, and who believed that a man of Dr. Welling’s character would find in
such a position a wide field of influence.

His aspirations for the university were never fully realized, owing to the impos-
sibility of securing endowments from private sources for a public institution located
so near to the seat of government. He nevertheless secured a considerable addition
to its endowment, added new professional schools, greatly increased the number of
its faculty and students, removed the institution from the suburbs to a new build-
ing in the heart of the city, and accomplished many other things which seemed
really wonderful in view of the smallness of the resources at his-command. The
dream of his life was to establish a school of comparative jurisprudence—the only
one of its kind in the world—as a branch of the university. In 1892 he visited
Europe, secured approval of his plans from Sir Frederick Pollock and other eminent
jurists, and their promise to come to America to lecture as members of the faculty.
Failing health interfered with the realization of his plan, which I can but believe
he would have otherwise forced into success.

After his resignation of the presidency in 1893, he still retained the chair of inter-
national law and the position of dean of the university law school, and, full of
hopefulness, it was his purpose to labor on for his beloved project. He confidently
expected to live to be 80, and to devote the remaining ten years of his life to the
compilation of a political history of the civil war, a work for which no one was so
well qualified by experience, knowledge, and critical skill as himself. He was a
representative man in Washington, identified with all interests which tend toward
good citizenship, and held many positions of public trust and honor. He was
president of the board of trustees of the Corcoran Art Gallery and of the American
Copyright League, and was appointed by President Harrison commissioner to the
Columbian Historical Exposition at Madrid in 1892. His bearing was that of a
courteous gentleman of the old school. His scholarship was accurate, broad, and
genial, as was shown by the critical reviews which he contributed during his Jater
years to some of the principal American journals. His favorite study in hours of
relaxation was that of the sacred poetry of the early Christian Church, some
of which he had translated, though not for publication.

In 1884 he was chosen a Regent of this Institution to succeed the Reverend Dr.
Parker. For ten years he gave conscientious attention to its interests, and upheld

in every way those conservative and dignified traditions of which I have already
spoken of him as almost the living embodiment; and while he did this primarily
because of their harmony with his own personal tendencies and convictions as to
their value, he did so because of his affection and reverence for the first Secretary,
Joseph Henry, whose pupil he had been in his youth, and with whom in middle life
he maintained the relation of friend and confidant. After Henry’s death, Dr. Welling
consented to add to his already burdensome duties those of the chairman of the
Executive Committee, which he performed till his own death, so that he may be said
to have been a link between the past and present in the history of this Institution,
though happily not the only one, since it has preserved others in his contemporaries.

On motion, the resolutions were unanimously adopted by a standing
vote. :

The Secretary then presented his printed annual report to June 30,
1894, and recalled to the Regents the fact that by act of Congress,
approved by the President March 12, 1894, section 5579 of the Revised
Statutes was amended to read as follows:

That the President, the Vice-President, the Chief Justice, and the heads of Execu-
tive Departments are hereby constituted an establishment by the name of the
Smithsonian Institution for the increase and diffusion of knowledge among men,
and by that name shall be known and have perpetual succession, with the powers,
limitations, and restrictions hereinafter contained, and no other.

As now organized, the Smithsonian Establishment consists of the
following ex officio members:

GROVER CLEVELAND, President of the United States.
ADLAL E. STEVENSON, Vice-President of the United States.
MELVILLE W. FULLER, Chief Justice of the United States.
WALTER Q. GRESHAM, Secretary of State.

JOHN G. CARLISLE, Secretary of the Treasury.

DANIEL S. LAMONT, Secretary of War.

RICHARD OLNEY, Attorney-General.

WILSON S. BISSELL, Postmaster-General.

Hitary A. HERBERT, Secretary of the Navy.

Hoke Smiru, Secretary of the Interior.

J. STERLING Mormon, Secretary of Agriculture.

By the same act section 5591 was amended as follows:

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive into the
Treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest of James Smithson, such sums
as the Regents may, from time to time, see fit to deposit, not exceeding, with the
original bequest, the sum of $1,000,000.

Provided, That this shall not operate as a limitation on the power of the Smith-
sonian Institution to receive money or other property by gift, bequest, or devise,
and to hold and dispose of the same in promotion of the purposes thereof.

The Secretary added that what he had otherwise said in the report
before the Board might almost be summarized in the statement that
the past year had been, in many respects, perhaps the busiest that the
Institution had ever known; and this both in the field of its ordinary
activities and in new ones.

The progress of the Museum had been very considerable, the collec-
tions were never in better condition, and the contributions to science
derived from their study had been of more than usual extent and value.
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XV

The buildings had been visited by 200,000 persons during the past
year, and a very large number of specimens, accurately named and
labeled, have been sent out to other museums and institutions through-
out the United States. It should be said, however, that those who are
interested in the Museum see with a feeling of real distress that, with
all that it is doing, it is compelled to come short of its functions as a
national institution, from the fact that such large collections of material
gathered on the North American continent are being carried abroad
for the want of means to retain them at home, and that desirable col-
lections in every other field are constantly slipping out of our grasp.
European museums have spent during the last year hundreds of
thousands of dollars in availing themselves of the fast diminishing
opportunities for making collections of material objects representing

the work of the primitive races of this continent, while the entire sum

FOR

of money available here for this purpose has been $3,725. Notwith-
standing the great opportunities offered at the close of the Chicago
Exposition, within the past year the new Field Columbian Museum
had expended probably more than $500,000 in the purchase of collec-
tions, and the American Museum of Natural History in New York not
less than $100,000.

The Secretary went on to say that he need hardly recall that the
Zoological Park, as originally sanctioned by the Regents, was a national
and not a local measure. It was to be a great preserve of certain animal
races of the continent—like, for instance, the buffalo—and was to do
work which, for reasons already explained, the great national parks of
the West could not do so well. This was to be its primary function, and
recreation a subordinate one. Indirectly, if not through formal legisla-
tion, the direction in which the park is tending is more that of the
ordinary zoological garden, where entertainment is a principal feature,
than in that of the primary object. In spite of this the park has pre-
served, as far as it can, the lines of the original purpose. The buffalo,
for example, are breeding in captivity in a way only possible in such
paddocks as can be provided in this large reserve, while others of the
great races are being sheltered, and the park is, though in a limited
measure, filling its place as a city of refuge for these vanishing animal
peoples. The Regents will be glad to know that a secondary legitimate
object of the gardens is being most amply filled, for, to use a common
expression, it is becoming like “the lungs of the city,” since, from its
position, it is accessible to the poor as well as to the rich, and is for the
health and recreation of every citizen; and he would mention in striking
evidence of the public appreciation of this most important feature, and
as an evidence that the Regents’ large intent has not wholly failed of
its purpose, that the park, even in its inchoate condition, has been
visited by as many as 30,000 people in a single day.

The Secretary continued that the work of the Bureau of Ethnology
lies largely in collecting and preserving material for the study of the
XVI JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

languages of the Indian tribes of the continent, upon which all con-
clusions as to their origin and relationship so closely depend; and in
that respect the Bureau had done its usual valuable service. He had
authorized the sending out, on its own account, minor expeditions for
collecting records of the vanishing aboriginal races and for the study
of the peculiar customs among the last of the really savage tribes of our
borders, and important results had been obtained, such, for instance,
asin a recent expedition to the home of the Papagos and Seri Indians.

The Secretary called the attention of the Regents to the growing
activities and consequent increased labor in the Bureau of Interna-
tional Exchanges. There are something like 24,000 correspondents
seatterec over the world, and its usefulness has never been greater.
These correspondents are partly indicated on the map inserted in the
report, which strikingly shows their world-wide distribution, where it
will be noticed that the occurrence of the red dots is about propor-
tional to the spread of civilization, and where a glance shows that a
comparison of Spain and France, of China and Japan, in education,
may be inferred from their relationships to the Institution alone.

In regard to the Astrophysical Observatory, the Secretary remarked
that he had said less because it was something in which he had a strong
personal interest, and perhaps a personal bias; but under this correc-
tion he might observe that there was probably no other such observa-
tory in the world for just this purpose, or one whose work has had more
gratifying recognition from ali specialists in its own subject than this
has in the last year.

He further said that he had left to the last the mention of the affairs
of the parent Institution, and he desired at present to repeat that all
the activities which had just been mentioned, and which were now
supported by Government appropriations, were really carried on in
part by the Smithsonian fund, for there was no appropriation to meet
the general expenses of the Secretary’s office, incident to the admin-
istration of the different Government appropriations with which the
Institution was charged. He referred not only to the minor matters
of clerical and messenger service, but to the responsibilities connected
with the disbursement of Government funds and to the increasing
burden of general administrative work that can not be delegated by
the Secretary to an ordinary clerk, but calls for a much higher order
of ability, and necessarily also for more liberal compensation. These
expenses should not be borne by the Smithsonian fund, as they were,
to a large extent, at present; nor were they properly chargeable to any
one of the Government appropriations, but they were common to them
all.

In connection with the Hodgkins fund, the Secretary said that he
had already called the attention of the Regents to the fact that, in
accordance with the wishes of Mr. Hodgkins, he had submitted to him
before his death a plan for expending the income of the first two years _
JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS. XVII

of the Hodgkins bequest largely in prizes of considerable amounts,
which were intended to draw attention to the subject. He had also
placed before the Regents a portion of the circulars which were sent
all over the civilized world, on the part of the Institution, to this end,
and he had taken occasion in the same connection to send a description
of the Institution, written in various languages, which had been pre-
pared after consultation with one of the Regents, and which some of
them might care to see.

The result of this work had been the presentation of more than two
hundred coinpetitive works for the prizes, some of them from the most
eminent men of science in Europe and America, and some from names
comparatively unknown; and a committee—whose active members are
Dr. G. Brown Goode, Assistant Secretary of this Institution, Deputy
Surg. Gen. John 8. Billings, U.S. A., and Prof. Mark W. Harrington,
Chief of the Weather Bureau—was engaged in examining them.

It was expected that the European committee would be composed of
Professors Huxley, Janssen, and Helmholtz, who had kindly consented
to serve, but the death of the last-named eminent man of science has
temporarily deferred its formation.

The Secretary added that he was not yet prepared to advise the
Regents of the result of these competitions, further than to say that,
incidentally to their main object, they had probably brought the work
of the Institution before not only European men of science, but the
world of action, as well as of study, more completely than any incident
which had occurred at any time in its history. This interest was slow
in awakening, but afterwards grew rapidly, so that the time for receiv-
ing the essays was extended to the close of 1894.

The Secretary considered that the system of prizes had now com-
pleted its best work in calling attention to the Institution and the fund
it administered, as well as to its fitness as an administrator of other
trusts of this character.

The Secretary continued that he had already advised the Regents
that a bequest had been made to the Institution by a resident of Wash-
ington, Mr. Robert Stanton Avery, whose extremely feeble health at
the time of the last Board meeting did not give hope that he would
survive the year. Mr. Avery died on September 12, 1894. Owing to
the general fall in prices, the amount coming from the estate is likely
to be very much smaller than the testator supposed he was giving.

On motion, the report of the Secretary was accepted.

Dr. Coppée then said that by reason of the death of the chairman of
the Executive Committee, it devolved upon him to present the report
of that committee for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, which he
did in printed form, and, on motion, the report was adopted.

SM 95 II

XVIII JOURNAL OF PROCEEDINGS OF THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

Dr. Coppée then introduced the following resolution, which was
adopted:

Resolved, That the income of the Institution for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1896, be appropriated for the service of the Institution, to be expended by the Secre-
tary, with the advice of the Executive Committee, with full discretion on the part
of the Secretary as to items.

The Secretary stated that in 1874 the Institution received $1,000
from the estate of James Hamilton, esq., of Carlisle, Pa., bequeathed
in the following clause of his will:

I give $1,000 to the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution, located at
Washington, D. C., to be invested by said Regents in some safe fund, and the inter-
est to be appropriated biennially by the Secretaries, either in money or a medal, for

such contribution, paper, or lecture on any scientific or nseful subject as said Secre-
taries may approve.

Under resolution of the Regents, the bequest was deposited in the
Treasury on the same terms as the original Smithsonian bequest. In
administering the trust the income has thus far been only partially
used, the annual interest not being yet sufficient to bear the expense
attendant on the designing and striking of a proper medal. The
accrued interest on the fund having reached a sum more than equal
to the original bequest, $1,000 of this interest might now be added to
the principal, thus bringing the fund to $2,000, the interest on which
would more properly carry out the purposes of the testator. The
authority of the Regents was therefore requested for thus increasing
the original bequest and for treating the $2,000 thereby created as the
limit of a permanent fund to be called by the name of the donor, the
interest to be administered under the terms of the resolution relative
to income and expenditure.

Senator Henderson offered the following resolutions, explaining that
their purpose was to add $1,000 of the $1,200 which had accumulated
to the original bequest, which would make a fund of $2,000 and leave
a balance of interest to its credit of $200:

Resolved, That the Secretary is hereby authorized to add to the bequest of $1,000
received from James Hamilton the accrued interest upon the said bequest to the
amount of $1,000 and no more, the same to be deposited in the Treasury of the United
States under the terms of section 5591 of the Revised Statutes. ,

Resolved, That the fund of $2,000 thus created be known as the “‘ Hamilton fund,”

and that the income from this fund be administered by the Secretary under the terms
of the resolution relative to income and expenditure.

On motion, the resolutions were adopted.
There being no further business to come before the Board, on motion,
it adjourned.
REPORT OF THE EXECUTIVE COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF
REGENTS OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION

For THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1895,

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution:

- Your Executive Committee respectfully submits the following report

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
Condition of the fund July 1, 1895.

The amount of the bequest of James Smithson deposited in the
Treasury of the United States, according to act of Congress of August
10, 1846, was $515,169. To this was added by authority of Congress,
February 8, 1867, the residuary legacy of Smithson and savings from
income and other sources, to the amount of $134,831.

To this also have been added a bequest from James. Hamilton, of
Pennsylvania, of $1,000; a bequest of Dr. Simeon Habel, of New York,
of $500; the proceeds of the sale of Virginia bonds, $51,500; a gift
from Thomas G. Hodgkins, of New York, of $200,000, and $8,000,
being a portion of the residuary legacy of Thomas G. Hodgkins, and
$1,000, the accumulated interest on the Hamilton bequest, making in
all, as the permanent fund, $912,000.

The net expenditures of the Institution for the year ending June 30,
1895, were therefore $52,750.68, or $6,074.33 less than the gross expendi-
tures, $58,825.06, as above stated.

All moneys received by the Smithsonian Institution from interest,
sales, refunding of moneys temporarily advanced, or otherwise, are
deposited with the Treasurer of the United States to the credit of the
Secretary of the Institution, and all payments are made by his checks
on the Treasurer of the United States.

REPORT

OF

SD ee UNECE e
SECRETARY OF THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION,

FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1895.

To the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENTLEMEN: In accordance with established custom I have the
honor to submit herewith a report of the operations of the Smithsonian
Institution for the year ending June 30, 1895, including the work placed
by Congress under its supervision in the National Museum, the Bureau
of Ethnology, the Bureau of International Exchanges, the National
Zoological Park, and the Astro-physical Observatory.

I have given briefly in the body of the report a general account of
the affairs of the Institution and of its bureaus for the year, reserving
for the appendix the more detailed and statistical reports from the offi-
cers in charge of the different branches of work.

The full report upon the National Museum by the assistant secretary,
Dr. G. Brown Goode, occupies a separate volume (Report of the
Smithsonian Institution, National Museum, 1895).

THE SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.

sM 95——1 1
2 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

THE BOARD OF REGENTS.

In accordance with a resolution of the Board of Regents adopted
January 8, 1890, by which its annual meeting occurs on the fourth
Wednesday of each year, the Board met on January 23, 1895, at 10
o'clock a.m. The journal of its proceedings will be found, as hitherto,
in the annual report of the Board to Congress, though reference is
made later on in this report to several matters upon which action was
taken at that meeting.

It becomes my sad duty to announce the death of two members of
the executive committee of the Board of Regents during the year, Dr.
Welling, on September 4, 1894, and Dr. Coppée, on March 21, 1895. I
give sketches of their lives and work on subsequent pages devoted to
necrology.

On February 27, 1895, Mr. Gardiner G. Hubbard, of Washington City,
was appointed a Regent by joint resolution of Congress.

The term of office of Senator Cullom expired with his term as Sena-
tor on March 4, 1895.

ADMINISTRATION.

The expenses borne by the Institution, incidental to its administration
of Government trusts, are increasing so rapidly that I feel it my duty
to again call attention to the subject, though it has been mentioned at
greater or less length in all of my recent reports. The expenses that I
refer to are not specifically provided for by any of the present appro-
priations, since they belong, not singly to the National Museum, or to
the Bureau of Ethnology, or to the International Exchange Service, or
the like, but to expenditures common to all of them. I deem it in the
interest of economy that an appropriation be asked to cover these items,
for it seems manifest that this expenditure should be met from some
common source, owing to the limited size of the establishments in
question, some of which are rather assimilable to divisions than to
bureaus. It is evident, for instance, that an appropriation of $17,000
for international exchanges or an appropriation of $10,000 for an
observatory can not each so well bear the separate provision of a dis-
bursing officer, a stenographer, and the other like employees as in the
case of larger bureaus. There is, however, no practicable way of
arranging this in accordance with the present terms of the appropria-
tions, which may be said to tacitly assume that each of these bureaus
or divisions is thus completely provided for. It is in some cases impos-
sible that it should be so without the expenditure of much more than
the appropriated sum, and the terms of the appropriations should, in
the interest of economy, either recognize the propriety of meeting each
bureaw’s share of these common expenses out of each one’s appro-
priation, or else out of a special appropriation made in their common
interest.

The Regents also hold certain approved railroad bonds, forming a
part of the fund established by Mr. Hodgkins for investigations of
the properties of atmospheric air.

By act of Congress approved by the President March 12, 1894, an
amendment was made to section 5591 of the Revised Statutes, the
fundamental act organizing the Institution, as follows:

The Secretary of the Treasury is authorized and directed to receive
into the Treasury, on the same terms as the original bequest of James
Smithson, such sums as the Regents may, from time to time, see fit to
deposit, not exceeding, with the original bequest, the sum of $1,000,000:
Provided, That this shall not operate as a limitation on the power of
the Smithsonian Institution to receive money or other property by gift,
bequest, or devise, and to hold and dispose of the same in promotion
of the purposes thereof.

Under this section 5591 of the Revised Statutes, modified as above
noted, the fund of $912,000 is deposited in the Treasury of the United
States, bearing interest at 6 per cent per annum, the interest alone
being used in carrying out the aims of the Institution.

At the beginning of the fiscal year, July 1, 1894, the unexpended
_ balance from the income and from other sources, as stated in my report
for last year, was $59,598.50. Interest on the permanent fund in the
Treasury and elsewhere, amounting to $56,153.92, was received during
the year, which, together with a sum of $6,074.38, received from the
sale of publications and from miscellaneous sources, made the total
receipts $62,228.30.

The entire expenditures during the year, including the $1,000 accu-
mulated interest on the Hamilton fund, mentioned above, which was
added to the permanent fund, amounted to $58,825.06, for the details
of which reference is made to the report of the executive committee.
On June 30, 1895, the balance in the Treasury of the United States to
the credit of the secretary for the expenses of the Institution was
$63,001.74, which includes the sum of $10,000 referred to in previous
reports, $5,000 received from the estate of Dr. J. H. Kidder, and a like
sum from Dr. Alexander Graham Bell, the latter a gift made personally

4 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

to the secretary to promote certain physical researches. This latter
sum was, with the donor’s consent, deposited by the secretary to the
credit of the current funds of the Institution. .

This balance also includes the interest accumulated on the Hodgkins
donation, which is held against certain contingent obligations, besides
relatively considerable sums held to meet obligations which may be
expected to mature as the result of different scientific investigations or
publications in progress.

The Institution has been charged with the disbursement, during the
fiscal year 1894-95, of the following appropriations:

All the vouchers and checks for the disbursements have been examined
by the executive committee, and the expenditures will be found reported
in accordance with the provisions of the sundry civil acts of October
2, 1888, and August 5, 1892, in a letter addressed to the Speaker of the
House of Representatives.

The vouchers for all the expenditures from the Smithsonian fund
proper have been likewise examined and their correctness certified to
by the executive committee, whose statement will be published, together
with the accounts of the funds appropriated by Congress, in that com-
mittee’s report.

The estimates for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1896, for carrying
on the Government interests under the charge of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution, and forwarded as usual to the Secretary of the Treasury, were

BUILDINGS.

On a subsequent page I again call attention to the excessively over-
crowded condition of the National Museum building and to the neces-
sity of continuing the use of several wooden sheds adjacent to the
Smithsonian building for storage purposes, constituting a constant
menace to the safety of the main building and its contents. I can give
no more adequate idea of the real danger from fire that here exists than
by stating that no insurance company was found willing to place insur-
ance upon these sheds or their contents at less than ten times the ordi-
nary rates. The provision made by the last Congress for rent of addi.
tional storage rooms proves inadequate for the needs of the Museum,
as I have represented elsewhere.

REPAIRS TO THE SMITHSONIAN BUILDING.

In continuing much needed improvements in the east wing of the
Smithsonian building, especially with a view to better light and venti-
lation, the lighting of the rooms on the first floor occupied by the
library, has been greatly improved by enlarging the window frames and
replacing the small diamond panes by single sheets of glass. Similar
changes have been made in the Secretary’s office, on the second floor, as
well as in some of the rooms on the third and fourth floors. Several
rooms on the fourth floor, heretofore of no use except for storage, have
been made habitable and have proved useful for various needed pur-
poses.

The sanitary condition of the building has been improved by the
removal of certain objectionable features and by the installation of a
comprehensive system of ventilation by which pure air at an equable
temperature is assured in most of the office rooms. Work upon this
was well advanced at the close of the year.

Another great improvement added during the year is the introduc-
tion of electric lights in all the offices of the east wing, the electric
power being supplied by a special plant, which, with the ventilating
apparatus, has been placed in the basement of the south tower, where
considerable changes were tnade for their accommodation.

For the proper heating and ventilation of the Astro-physical Observa-
tory a dry-air duct has been built connecting the observatory with
the systems of the main building.

These minor repairs which I have thus briefly mentioned have made
the rooms of the east wing much better adapted to use as offices.

RESEARCH.

In pursuance of what appears to be an essential portion of the origi-
nal plan for the organization of the Institution, that its secretary
Should be expected to personally contribute to the advancement of
knowledge, whether in letters or in science, I have given such time as
6 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

I could spare from engrossing administrative duties to the prosecution
of two independent investigations which had engaged my attention for
several years before I became connected with the Institution, and which
I believe are likely to lead to important scientific and utilitarian results.
The first of these researches, that upon the solar spectrum, has been
carried on in the Astro-physical Observatory, and to it I have referred
more at length in the account of the observatory. The second
research, an investigation of certain physical data of aerodynamics,
has been continued with results which appear to be approaching the
time of publication.

Prof. E. W. Morley’s investigations on the density of oxygen and
hydrogen, referred to in previous reports as aided in part by the Insti-
tution, have been completed, and his memoir is now in press. The
atomic weight of oxygen may be called the base upon which practically
our entire system of atomic weights rests, and a small error in its
measurement becomes large by multiplication in the higher parts of the
atomic-weight scale. Hence its accurate determination is of funda-
mental importance. In his investigation Professor Morley has studied
the problem by two methods:

(1) By the synthesis of water, in which he, for the first time, has
achieved completeness by actually weighing the hydrogen, the oxygen,
and the water formed, whereas all his predecessors took one or another
of these factors by difference.

(2) By the density ratios between oxygen and hydrogen. In this
method he has weighed the gases of greater purity and in larger quan-
tity than hitherto, and he has in some instances operated without the
intervention. of stopcocks, and therefore with no possibility of error due
to leakage. He has also, as a correction to the density ratio, redeter-
mined the composition of water by volume.

By both methods he reaches the same result: O=15.879, with vari-
ation in the fourth decimal place as between the two.

The valuable balance purchased for these investigations has been
returned to the Institution.

The subscription has been continued for 20 copies of the Astronom-
ical Journal as a slight aid to its publication, the separate numbers of
the journal being sent regularly to foreign libraries and observatories
as exchanges of the Institution.

A small grant was made to Dr. Carl Barus to enable him to continue
certain investigations.

The researches that I have here referred to are connected altogether
with the physical sciences. In the biological sciences I may refer to the
work of the occupants of the Smithsonian table at Naples, though the
Institution’s work in this field has been largely indirectly provided
throughits connection with the National Museum. Investigations aided
by the Hodgkins fund are mentioned elsewhere.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. %

EXPLORATIONS.

The Institution has carried on some interesting ethnological and
natural-history explorations during the year,as noticed in detail on
other pages in the reports on the National Museum and the Bureau of
Ethnology.

I will here call special attention to the benefit that has been derived
from the explorations made by Dr. William L. Abbott and by Mr.
William Astor Chanler and Lieut. von Hohnel in Africa and India.
Many valuable ethnological and natural-history objects which they
have collected on these expeditions have been courteously placed in the
National Museum as additions to the collection they had previously con-
tributed.

In the Azores Prof. William Trelease has gathered some interesting
natural-history specimens.

Lieut. Wirt Robinson, U.S. A., has made large collections of mam-
mals and pottery in Florida, and Mr. Mark B. Kerr has contributed a
collection of fossils from Ecuador.

Explorations have been continued among the aboriginal villages
in northeastern Arizona. Some particularly interesting explorations
were made in Arizona and Sonora (Mexico) among the Papago and Seri
Indians, where a number of prehistoric ruins were discovered with
extensive irrigation works, and studies were made of the arts and cus-
toms of those hitherto little-known Indians.

Ethnological researches were also carried on among the Kathlamet
Indians of the lower Columbia region and among the Kiowa and
other plains Indians in Indian Territory.

Explorations begun during May in the Red Rock country, southwest
of Flagstaff, Ariz., by Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, as a part of the work of
the Bureau of Ethnology, have resulted in the discovery of a group of
extensive cliff ruins hitherto unknown to archeologists and not
despoiled by white men, and excavations in that region were in prog-
ress at the close of the fiscal year.

PUBLICATIONS.

The plan of organization adopted by the Regents in 1847 contem-
plated the publication of a series of reports giving an account of the
new discoveries in science and of the changes made from year to year
in all branches of knowledge not strictly professional, and a second
series of separate treatises on subjects of general interest, consisting
of valuable memoirs translated from foreign languages, or of articles
prepared under the direction of the Institution.

Three series of publications have actually been established, the Con-
tributions to Knowledge, the Miscellaneous Collections, and the Annual
Reports, the first two being printed at the expense of the Institution,
while the reports are Government documents. The Institution also

issues various publications through the National Museum and the
Bureau of Ethnology.

Contributions to Knowledge-—No memoir of the Contributions to
Knowledge was completed during the present year, though two papers
now in type wiil be published early in the next fiscal year—one of these
is a memoir by Professor Morley on the densities of oxygen and
hydrogen, and the second a report by Drs. J. 8. Billings, S. Weir
Mitchell and D. H. Bergey on investigations carried on by them, under
a grant from the Hodgkins fund, to determine the nature of supposed
poisonous properties of expired air.

It was hoped that during the year two elaborate memoirs, on
“Oceanic ichthyology” and on “Life histories of North American
birds,” mentioned in my last report, would be published, but they are
not yet completed, though they are entirely ready for presswork.

Miscellaneous Collections.—Five papers of this series were issued
during the year, besides separates of the several scientific papers con-
tained in the General Appendix of the Annual Report.

In connection with the system of meteorological observations estab-
lished by the Smithsonian Institution about 1850, a series of meteoro-
logical tables was compiled by Dr. Arnold Guyot, at the request of
Secretary Henry, and was published in 1852. A second edition was
issued in 1857, and a third edition, with further amendmeuts, in 1859.
Though primarily designed for meteorological observers reporting to the
Smithsonian Institution, the tables were so widely used by physicists
that, after twenty-five years of valuable service, the work was again
revised and a fourth edition was published in 1884. In a few years the
demand for the tables exhausted the edition, and it appeared to me
desirable to recast the work entirely, rather than to undertake its revi-
sion again. After careful consideration I decided to publish a new
work in three parts—Meteorological Tables, Geographical Tables, and
Physical Tables—each representative of the latest knowledge in its
field, and independent of the others, but the three forming a homo-
geneous series. Although thus historically related to Dr. Guyot’s
Tables, the present work is so entirely changed with respect to mate-
rial, arrangement, and presentation that if is not a fifth edition of the
older tables, but essentially a new publication.

The first volume of the new series of Smithsonian Tables (the Meteor-
ological Tables) appeared in 1893, and so great has been the demand
for it that a second edition has already become necessary. The second
volume of the series (the Geographical Tables) was published during
this year. It was prepared by Prof. R. 8S. Woodward, formerly of the
United States Coast and Geodetic Survey, but now of Columbia Col-
lege, New York.

The manuscript of the Physical Tables, prepared by Prof. Thomas
Gray, has been sent to the printer and some progress made toward its
publication. This work will form the third volume of Smithsonian
Tables.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 9

In continuation of the series of indexes to chemical literature, pre-
pared under the direction and on the recommendation of a committee
of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, three
additional pamphlets have been issued, entitled Indexes to the Litera-
tures of Cerium and Lanthanum, by W. H. Magee, Ph. D.; Index to
the Literature ot Didymium, by A. C. Langmuir, Ph. D.; and Bibli-
ography of Aceto Acetic Ester, by Paul H. Seymour, M.S.

One of the treatises in the Miscellaneous Collections published during
the year, entitled The Varieties of the Human Species, by Giuseppe
Sergi, a translation of that author’s work, Le Varieta Umane, Principi
e metodo di Classificazione, Torino, 1893, sets forth quite fully his
doctrines of craniology, elaborating a plan for a classification of human
species based on shapes of the crania.

AS a special publication of the Institution there was issued a Diary
of a Journey through Mongolia and Tibet in 1891 and 1892, by Mr.
William Woodville Rockhill. It is an octavo volume of 443 pages,
illustrated by 13 text figures and 28 plates, together with a large map
on a scale of 32 miles to the inch, showing the route traversed and the
topographic features of those little-known regions. The journey was
undertaken partly under the auspices of the Smithsonian Institution.
In addition to much valuable information gathered concerning the
characteristic features of those countries, Mr. Rockhill made some very
interesting ethnological collections for the National Museum, which are
described in detail in one of the accompanying papers of the Museum
teport for 1893.

A revised edition of the Catalogue of Scientific and Technical Peri-
odicals (1665-1882), published by the Institution in 1885, is being pre-
pared under the direction of Dr. H. C. Bolton. In this new work the
periodicals in the former edition will be continued to 1895, and new publi-
cations will be added, making the catalogue as near as possible complete
to the time of printing.

A supplement to the Bibliography of Chemistry, 1492-1892, published
in 1893, is being prepared by Dr. Bolton, with the assistance of several
collaborators in European libraries, and will bring the work down as
near as practicable to date.

Annual Reports.—The Smithsonian Annual Report is the only public
document published by the Institution, and the greater portion of the
edition is distributed through the document rooms of the Senate and
House of Representatives. It is in two volumes—the first devoted to
the Institution proper and the second part relating to the National
Museum. The General Appendix of Part I consists of selected memoirs
of a special interest and permanent value which have, for the most part,
already appeared elsewhere, and which are sufficiently untechnical to
be interesting to the general reader.

The Annual Report of the Institution for 1893 and of the National
Museum for 1892 were received from the Public Printer and distributed
during the year, and the Museum report for 1893 was nearly completed.
10 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The manuscript of both volumes of the report for 1894 has been sent
to the printer, and some progress made toward their publication. -

The secretary’s report for the year ending June 30, 1894, was sub-
mitted in printed form to the Board of Regents at their January meeting.

Proceedings and bulletin of the National Museum.—The publications
of the Museum are discussed on another page, and therefore need no
reference here other than to mention that there were issued fifty-six
separate papers of the proceedings, chiefly on natural-history subjects,
and one number of the bulletin series, of interest chiefly to entomolo-
gists. ;

Bureau of Ethnology publications.—The eleventh and twelfth annual
reports of the Bureau of Ethnology were published during the year,
and the thirteenth report was put in type, while the manuscript of the
fourteenth and fifteenth reports have been sent to the printer, thus
bringing the work practically to date. The contents of the published
volumes, as also mention of several papers of the bulletin series, are
discussed on subsequent pages.

LIBRARY.

The growth of the library steadily continues, 31,953 titles having been
added during the past year. Among the more notable accessions, I
may mention a collection of albums of photographs presented by the
Sultan of Turkey, which portray the natural scenery, the art, education,
industries, and government of the Ottoman Empire.

It has been possible to improve the light in the reading room of the
library offices and to assign another small room to the library, and a
small collection of wholesome popular literature has been commenced
for the use of the employees of the Institution.

The results of the plan to increase the library by exchange, detailed
in my report for 1887-88, have been carefully tabulated with a view to
the completion of incomplete sets of periodicais and the publications of
_learned societies, and to further additions to the already large list.

This plan has thus far, after seven years’ labor, secured for the Insti-
tution 2,035 new periodicals and the entire or partial completion of
1,133 defective series.

The tabulation shows that the Institution now possesses 869 complete
sets of foreign publications and 395 of American publications, while
888 sets of foreign publications and 569 sets of American publications
are aS complete as the publishers are able to make them.

The collection of scientific and other periodicals possessed by the
Institution is now probably the largest in the English-speaking world—
numbering, approximately, 4,000. Many of these are no longer pub-
lished, and in some cases the exchange is discontinued. At present
there are currently received 3,045; of these, 1,372 are in the English
language, 621 in German, and 423 in French, the remainder represent-
ing almost all the languages of civilized nations, and including publi-

cations even in modern Greek, Japanese, and Arabic. There are 825
annuals, 397 quarterlies, 670 monthlies, and the remainder are issued
at different intervals or irregularly. A portion are for the present
retained for reference, but are ultimately designed for the Smithsonian
deposit at the Library of Congress. Itis my desire that the Institution
shall keep abreast of the ever-growing number of scientific periodicals
and journals and of the publications of societies cultivating the various
branches of science. The work is never ending, and the preparation of
new lists and correspondence for exchange and revision are constantly
going on.

The time is now not far distant when an adequate provision will be
made for the major portion of the Smithsonian library, which is, in
accordance with the act of 1865, deposited with the Library of Con-
gress. The Librarian cf Congress states that the Smithsonian library
will be arranged in a separate stack of the new building, now completed
and rapidly approaching the time when it will be habitable, and that a
Special reading room, convenient to the main reading room and the
stack, will be provided. It may be suitable to mention, in connection
with the library, the fact that the Institution is now, as it has been
from its inception, heartily interested in the publication of bibliograph-
ical memoirs and in the general subject of the bibliography of science.

During the past year I have been informed of a project of the Royal
Society for the preparation of a bibliography of science, beginning
with the year 1900, and some correspondence on this important subject
has taken place between the Royal Society and the Institution. At
the present writing no definite result has been reached.

HODGKINS FUND.

‘It is gratifying to the Institution to note the wide interest taken in
the Hodgkins fund prizes which were offered for certain essays upon
the properties of atmospheric air, in accordance with the wishes of the
donor of the fund, Mr. Thomas G. Hodgkins. ‘

The recent discoveries made upon the composition of atmospheric air
have been most important, and researches now in progress seem to
promise still further additions to the knowledge of our atmosphere.

It will be remembered that three prizes were offered—one for $10,000,
one for $2,000, and one for $1,000; the terms of competition being stated
in a circular issued by the Institution in 1893 and printed in full in my
report for that year.

For reasons stated in a circular issued in June, 1894, the time for
submitting memoirs in competition for the Hodgkins fund prizes was
extended from July 1 to December 31, 1894, and resulted in a consid-
erable increase in the number of papers, so that the total number up to
December 31, 1894, was 218.

It is interesting to note the various countries that participated in
this competition: the United States contributing 66 memoirs, France
12 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

40, Germany 33, England 19, Italy 8, Russia 6, Austria-Hungary 9, and
Denmark 4; the other countries represented were Belgium, Scotland,
Ireland, Norway, Bohemia, Finland, Spain, Bavaria, Switzerland,
Servia, India, Canada, Mexico, and Argentina.

As soon as the competition was closed the following circular was
sent to all participants, and was published in several of the leading
scientific journals:

SMITHSONIAN INSTITUTION.
HODGKINS PRIZES.

WASHINGTON, January 10, 1895.

Sir: The time for the reception of treatises or essays offered in com-
petition for the Hodgkins fund prizes of $10,000, of $2,000, and of
$1,000, respectively, closed on the 31st of December, 1894, and all —
papers so offered are now in the hands of the committee of award.

In view of the very large number of competitors, of the delay which
will be necessarily caused by the intended careful examination, and of
the further time which may be required to consult a European advisory
committee, if one be appointed, it is announced that authors are now
at liberty to publish these treatises or essays without prejudice to their
interest as competitors.

Very respectfully, S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

The circular was also issued in French, as follows:

MONSIEUR: Le terme fixé pour la réception des traités ou des essais
soumis au concours du fonds Hodgkins, pour les prix de 10,000, 2,000,
et 1,000 dollars, est expiré le 31 décembre 1894 et tous les ouvrages
présentés sont actuellement entre les mains de la commission des
récompenses.

En raison du tres-grand nombre de concurrents, du délai qu’entrai-
nera examen sérieux que l’on compte faire, et du temps qui pourrait
étre exigé pour prendre V’avis du comité consultatif d’Europe, s’il en
est nommé un, il est donné avis que ces traités ou essais pourront
maintenant étre publiés par leurs auteurs en toute liberté et sans que
leurs intéréts de concurrents en soient atteints.

S. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

The committee of award was composed of Dr. S. P. Langley, chair-
man, ex officio; Dr. G. Brown Goode, Assistant Secretary of the Smith-
sonian Institution; Asst. Surg. Gen. John 8S. Billings, United States
Army; and Prof. M. W. Harrington, Chief of the United States Weather

sureau.

The foreign advisory committee was represented by Mons. J. Janssen,
Prof. T. H. Huxley, and Professor von Helmholtz; and after the death
of the latter, Dr. W. von Bezold was added.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ihe

Immediately upon the close of the competition the award committee
began examination of the papers, and at the end of the fiscal year had
practically completed their labors. Although the awards were not
formally announced until August 9, yet in view of the importance
and opportuneness of the subject it seems proper to include the com-
mittee’s report in my report for this year.

tO of the committee appointed by the Smithsonian Institution to award
the Hodgkins fund prizes.

The committee of award for the Hodgkins prizes of the Smithsonian
Institution has completed its examination of the 218 papers submitted
in competition by contestants.

The committee is composed of the following members:

Dr. 8. P. Langley, chairman, ex-officio; Dr. G. Brown Goode, appointed
by the Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution; Asst. Surg. Gen. John
S. Billings, by the president of the National Academy of Sciences; Prof.
M. W. Harrington, by the president of the American Association for
the Advancement of Science.

. The foreign advisory committee, as first constituted, was represented

by Mons. J. Janssen, Prof. T. H. Huxley,and Professor von Helmholtz;
and after the recent loss of the latter, Dr. W. von Bezold was added.
After consultation with these eminent men, the committee decided as
follows:

First prize, of $10,000, for a treatise embodying some new and
important discoveries in regard to the nature or properties of atmos-
pherie air, to Lord Rayleigh, of London, and Prof. William Ramsay, of
the University College, London, for the ‘discovery of argon, a new ele-
ment of the atmosphere.

The second prize, of $2,000, is not awarded, owing to the failure of
any contestant to comply strictly with the terms of the offer.

The third prize, of $1,000, to Dr. Henry de Varigny, of Paris, for the
best popular treatise upon atmospherie air, its properties and relation-
ships. Dr. de Varigny’s essay is entitled ‘‘ L’Air et la Vie.”

the award of any medals, there remained several papers to which the
committee had been unable to give any prize, but to which they had
felt desirous to give some honorable mention, and on their representing
this to the Smithsonian Institution, they have been commissioned to do
So and also to give certain medals of silver and bronze which had been
subsequently placed at their disposition.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 15

Immediately after the announcement of the award of the first prize
to Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay, of London, for their discovery
of “argon,” an element of the atmosphere, a draft for $10,000 was
despatched to these gentlemen, through the courtesy of the Department
of State, and of the Hon. Thomas F. Bayard, United States ambassador
to Great Britain.

With regard to other work carried on by the Hodgkins fund, I may
state that Dr. J. S. Billings and Dr. 8S. Weir Mitchell have completed
the investigations begun by them in 1893, under a grant from the
Hodgkins fund, to determine the nature of the peculiar substances of
organic origin contained in the air expired by human beings, and their
report 1S now in press.

In their report the investigators state that for a number of years
prior to 1888 the prevailing view among physicians and sanitarians
had been that the discomfort and dangers to health and life which had
been known to exist, sometimes at least, in unventilated rooms occu-
pied by a number of human beings were largely or entirely due to
peculiar organic matters contained in air expired by these persons, and
that the increase in carbonic acid due to respiration had but little effect
in producing these results, its chief importance being that it furnished
a convenient means of determining the amount of vitiation of the air.
Recently, however, several experimenters have concluded that the
organic matters in the exhaled breath are not harmful, at all events to
animals, and the main object of the investigations was to determine
the correctness of these conclusions.

The investigators found that the air in inhabited rooms, such as the
hospital ward in which experiments were made, is contaminated from
many sources besides the expired air of the occupants, and that the
most important of these contaminations are in the form of minute par-
ticles or dust, in which there are micro-organisms, including some
of the bacteria which produce inflammation and suppuration. It is
probable that these dust particles were the only really dangerous ele-
ments in the air, and it appears improbable that there is any peculiar
volatile poisonous matter in the air expired by healthy men and ani-
mals other than carbonic acid.

In concluding their report the authors state that the results of the
investigations, taken in connection with the results of other researches
summarized in the report, indicate that some of the theories upon which
modern systems of ventilation are based are either without foundation
or doubtful, and that the problem of securing comfort and health in
inhabited rooms requires the consideration of the best methods of pre-
venting or disposing of dusts of various kinds, of properly regulating
temperature and moisture, and of preventing the entrance of poisonous
gases like-carbonic oxide derived from heating and lighting apparatus,
rather than upon simply diluting the air to a certain standard of pro-
portion of carbonic acid present.
16 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The work of Dr.O. Lummer and Dr. E. Pringsheim, under a grant from
the Hodgkins fund, on the determination of an exact measure of the
cooling of gases while expanding, with a view to revising the value of
that important constant technically termed the “gamma” function,
was referred to in my last report.

The limitations of the fund have rendered it necessary, with slight
exceptions, to postpone further action on requests for grants, although
it is hoped that it will prove practicable at a later date to aid certain
important researches which are under consideration.

A design for the Hodgkins fund medal of the Institution was
decided upon in May, 1895, and the preparation of the dies has been
ordered.

AVERY FUND.

Mr. Robert Stanten Avery, of Washington City, died September 12,
1894, bequeathing the greater portion of his estate to the Smithsonian
Institution. The estate has not yet been fully administered upon, and
I am therefore unable to state the exact amount of the fund.

CORRESPONDENCE.

Besides the very voluminous routine and business correspondence of
the National Museum, or special correspondence of the Bureau of Eth-
nology, of the Zoological Park, and of the Bureau of Exchanges, a great
number of letters come directly to the Seeretary’s office from all parts of
the country, on every imaginable subject that can by any possibility
be supposed to have a relation to science. Requests for statistics that
may be of great value and importance to the writer, inquiries from
teachers and others, are constantly received, and it is still my aim that
this correspondence shall receive the same careful attention that was
bestowed upon it in the early days of the Institution, when the num-
ber of letters received formed but a small fraction of the present num-
ber; but it will be understood that the fulfilment of this aim grows
increasingly difficult. An effort is made to give a full reply to all such
inquiries, often invelving a large amount of labor on the part of the
curators, as well as of those immediately occupied with the correspond-
ence of the Institution, out of proportion to the merits of the case.

Of the more important correspondence of the Secretary’s office, 3,601
entries were made in the registry book of letters received during the
year, while double that number of letters were received and referred to
the different bureaus of the Institution inthesametime. A modification
of the system of registry was introduced on January 1, 1895, by which
each letter receives an arbitrary number indicating the date of the
letter and a subsidiary number giving the order of entry on that day.

The card index of letters received and written is now complete from
January 1, 1892, to the present day, constituting the current file. The
correspondence prior to the current file has been placed in the
archives, and the index to the files is now practically complete.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 17

As I have elsewhere remarked, this work of the Institution could be
much expedited, as far as the purely clerical part of it is concerned,
were al appropriation available for the general administrative pur-
poses to which I have referred more at length under “Administration.”

MISCELLANEOUS.

Naples table-—Dr. J.S. Billings, U.S. A., Dr. E. B. Wilson, Dr. J. A.
Ryder, and Dr. C. W. Stiles, as an advisory committee, have continued
valuable aid in examining the teStimonials of applicants for the occu-
pancy of the Naples table, as well as in the consideration of various
questions in connection with the assignment of the table, to which I have
asked attention. Dr. Ryder died in April, 1895, and was succeeded on
the committee by Dr. Harrison Allen.

The Smithsonian table at the Naples Zoological Station has proved of
value to the investigators who have carried on biological studies there
during the year.

Among the numerous additional applications for occupancy of the
table the following have been favorably acted upon:

Lewis Murbach, Ph. B., B. Sc., University of Michigan; appointed
for three months during summer and autumn of 1894.

T. H. Morgan, B.S., Ph. D., Johns Hopkins University; appointed
for six months, November 9, 1894, to May 9, 1895.

Herbert Osborn, professor of zoology and entomology, lowa Agricul-
tural College; appointed for three months in spring and summer of 184,

Thetable has been occupied constantly since October 1, 1893, the date
of the first appointment, with the exception of May, 1894. In several
instances Dr. Dohrn, the director of the station, has courteously
arranged for the accommodation of two occupants at the same time.

In order that all investigators may be given an equal opportunity to
avail themselves of the facilities for study at Naples, final action upon
applications is not taken more than six months in advance of the date
for which the table is desired, and when more than one application is
filed for the same period, presumably of equal merit, the assignment is
made according to priority of application. No appointment is made for
a period of more than six months.

The reports thus far submitted by the investigators who have occu-
pied the table indicate an appreciation of the special privileges there
offered for study.

Atlanta Exposition —Under the provisions of an appropriation made
by Congress for a Government exhibit at the Cotten States and Inter-
national Exposition at Atlanta, during the autumn of 1895, a very
satisfactory exhibit has been prepared, illustrating every phase of the
activities of the Institution and its bureaus, especially the National
Museum.

Oriental Congress.—As delegate of the Smithsonian Institution Prof.
Paul Haupt attended the Tenth International Congress of Oriental-

sm 95——2
18 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ists, held at Geneva, Switzerland, September 3-12, 1894. Besides the
Smithsonian the following American institutions and learned societies
were represented by delegates: Columbia College, Cornell University,
Johns Hopkins University, University of Minnesota, University of
Pennsylvania, American Oriental Society, American Philosophical
Society, Bureau of Education. The Congress was opened by the Pres-
ident of the Swiss Republic, Colonel Frey. The president of the con-
gress was the well-known Geneva egyptologist, M. Edouard Naville.
The work of the congress was organized in eight sections: India, lin-
guistics and Aryan languages, Semitic languages, Mohammedan lan-
guages, Egypt and African languages, Extreme Hast, Greece and the
Orient, Oriental geography and ethnography. There were altogether
about 600 members (about 100 of whom were ladies), representing
Africa, America, Asia, and 16 European countries. More than 275
(about 60 ladies) were present, not including those living at Geneva.
Of the 28 American subscribers (including 5 ladies), 12 (4 ladies)
attended the congress. Papers were read by the following American
members: Haupt, Jackson, Merriam, Rogers.

At the first meeting of the first section the great Sanskrit scholar of
the University of Berlin, Prof. A. Weber, referred to the death of Pro-
fessor Whitney, and the proposition of the president of the section,
Lord Reay, to send a resolution of respect and condolence to Mrs.
Whitney, was unanimously adopted.

The Eleventh International Congress of Orientalists will be held at
Paris in 1897.

Archives.—The special room set apart on the fourth floor for the bet-
ter arrangement of the valuable archives of the Institution has proved
of great convenience, as there is frequent necessity for reference to the
early correspondence files, or to other records.

Assignment of rooms.—A room in the basement of the east wing,
which has been specially fitted up with piers for pendulum experiments
and connected by telegraph, through the Western Union Telegraph
Company’s office, with the United States Naval Observatory, is still
reserved for the occasional use of the officers of the United States
Coast and Geodetic Survey.

The Astro-physical Observatory standard clock has been mounted
in the room adjoining, where it is protected from sudden changes in
temperature and other disturbances to which it would be liable in the
observatory building. It can be compared with the Naval Observa-
tory time signals, and provision has been made for transmitting its own
signals to any part of the Institution.

History of James Smithson.—Arrangements are in progress for plac-
ing bronze tablets on Smithson’s tomb and in the English church at
Genoa, in memory of the founder of the Smithsonian Institution.

A further English record has added somewhat to the knowledge of
Smithson’s personal family.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

A complete set of the publications of the Institution has been sent
to Pembroke College, Oxford, where Smithson received his education.

Portrait of Secretary Baird.—The Board having authorized a portrait
of Professor Baird, one has been painted by Mr. Robert Gordon Hardie
and placed in the Regents’ room of the Institution.

The Hamilton fund.—tThe original amount of $1,000, the bequest of
Mr. James Hamilton, of Pennsylvania, received by the Institution in
1874, has been increased during the year to $2,000 by the addition of
accumulated interest, under authority given by the Regents in their

- meeting of January 23, 1895.

American Historical Association.—The annual report of the American
Historical Association for the year 1894 has been transmitted to Con-
gress through the Secretary of the Institution, in accordance with the
act of incorporation of the association. These reports are Congressional
documents and the Institution has no control of their distribution.

American Medical Association.—A large collection of medical books,
which had for many years been in the care of the Institution as the
property of the American Medical Association, has been transferred
by the association to the Newberry Library in Chicago.

THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

In my last annual statement I pointed out three conditions which
are operating to seriously retard the growth of the National Museum:
First, the lack of space for the installation of objects which should be
placed on exhibition; second, the unsymmetrical growth of the collec-
tions; and third, the fact that the storage of collections in the wooden
sheds south of the Smithsonian building, as well as in the basement of
the building itself, is most undesirable and dangerous. The sum of $900,
allowed for 1896, will be necessarily expended in the rental of shop
and storage room in place of the “ Armory building.” The actually
dangerous wooden sheds must therefore remain occupied until a sum
of money is provided which will enable me to discontinue their use
altogether by renting other quarters, removed entirely from proximity
to the Smithsonian building.

The problem of even providing shelter of any kind for the vast
amount of material daily received from persons interested in the growth
and work of the Museum, still remains unsolved. The Institution is
placed in an embarrassing position. It has been designated by law as
the only depository of collections offered to, or made under the auspices
of, the Government, and can not, under the law, refuse to receive them.
The fact remains, however, that when accepted, there is no suitable
place in which to store them, and no space in the Museum building to
exhibit such of the objects as should properly be shown to the public.
As I have already pointed out, there is probably no museum in the
world in which so small a proportion of the objects worthy of exhibition
is visible to the public, or in which the objects exhibited are crowded
20 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

together so closely. It is now more true than ever that if another
museum building as large as the present one were provided, it could
be at once filled with specimens already on hand.

In my estimates to Congress I have frequently dwelt upon the need
of larger appropriations for the preservation of the collections, but
regret to say that no substantial increase has yet been made. Indeed,
the amount recently appropriated for the coming year (1895-96) is
nearly $2,000 less than for 1892, although the accessions since that
time have already amounted to more than 375,000 specimens. In my
estimates for 1897, recently submitted to the Secretary of the Treasury,
I placed stress upon the fact that the purchase of collections is now
essential for the completion of large and important series, the deficien-
cies in which can not be supplied in any other way.: Valuable collee-
tions which should by all means be acquired by the United States for
its National Museum are every year passing beyond our control, and
American students will be compelled more than in the past to pursue
their researches in the museums of foreign countries.

I desire to repeat that an unduly large proportion of the curators
are not compensated for their services from the Museum appropriation.
This is not as it should be, although without larger appropriations it is
impossible to make any additions to thesalaried staff. Many on the
clerical force, too, who have by long training become valuable, are
paid at rates considerably less than for similar services in the Execu-
tive Departments, and it is difficult to keep the force in effective condi-
tion on this account.

The resources of the Museum have been taxed to the utmost to pro-
vide cases for the collections, but the amount appropriated is altogether
inadequate. The sum of $10,000 which was allowed for the present
year (1895) is not sufficient for the construction of new cases and for
repairing old ones. I am therefore about to submit an estimate of
$30,000 for the year 1897. It not unfrequently happens that valuable
collections are offered to the Museum on condition that suitable cases
be provided. This seems a fair requirement, but it is one which unfor-
tunately the Museum is not always in a position to meet.

With a view to adding to the area available for the display of collec-
tions, I included in my estimates for this year (1895) an item of $8,000
for the erection of two galleries, one in the southwest court, and
another in the southeast range. Galleries were provided for in the
original plans for the Museum building, and can be supported so as
not to detract from the appearance of the halls or to interfere with the
present system of installation. No appropriation, however, was made.
The same amount was included for this- purpose in the estimates for
1896, but was again refused. I shall repeat the recommendation in my
estimates for 1897.

By the provisions of the new printing bill, as interpreted by the Pub-
lic Printer, the editions of the Proceedings and Bulletins of the Museum
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 21

have been reduced to 1,000 copies. This is most unfortunate, and unless
relief is obtained at once, will canse the suspension of the greater part
of the distribution of those volumes. It has hitherto been possible to
supply 2,300 of the most important libraries and about 500 specialists
with our publications, but unless the former number of copies is again
allowed, very little can be done in either direction. Furthermore, the
possibility of securing in exchange the publications of other institu-
tions, will be almost entirely removed. It is often possible to acquire
valuable specimens in exchange for publications, even when the owners
would not part with them fora money consideration. Papers of great
scientific value are not unfrequently offered to the Museum for publi-
cation, but it is now becoming necessary to decline to publish them,
as their acceptance would swell the cost of the annual printing for
the Museum to a sum far beyond the present allotment. Many impor-
tant papers published by the Museum are out of print, and should at
once be reprinted to supply the urgent demand, but this can not be
done without a larger appropriation.

It is not too much to say that the usefulness of the Museum will be
considerably impaired if the editions are not at least increased to their
former extent, namely, 3,000 copies. The relations of the Museum with
the colleges, scientific schools, scientific and technical societies in the
United States, as well as with the principal centers of learning through-
out the world, will be impaired. It should be borne in mind that the
publications of the Museum are not “public documents,” so that the
possibility of obtaining the usual increase of copies is precluded, none
others being printed excepting those which are actually paid for from
the Museum allotment for labels, Proceedings, and Bulletins. In view
of these facts I can not too strongly urge that the National Museum be
excepted from the restrictions of the printing act of January 12, 1895,
so far as the extent of the editions of its publications is concerned, and
that it be permitted to issue as large an edition both of Proceedings
and Bulletins as can be procured out of the Museum allotment. I have
asked for $18,000 for the year 1897, and am quite confident that this is
not by any means too large for the purpose. It is my belief that if
this amount be allowed—and provided that the Museum be removed
from the restriction of the printing act in this particular—the number
of copies can be increased to 5,000. This would enable the Museum to |
meet its obligations, and to use a fair proportion of its publications in
exchange for specimens as well as for the publications of other scientific
institutions.

In recognition of services being rendered to the Museum the hon-
orary title of ‘‘ Associate” has been conferred on Dr. Theodore N. Gill,
in zoology, Dr. R. E. OC. Stearns, in zoology, Dr. R. W. Shufeldt, in
comparative anatomy, and Dr. C. A. White, in paleontology.

By act of Congress approved August 18, 1894, the Smithsonian
Institution and the National Museum were directed to participate in
2? REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the Cotton States and International Exposition in Atlanta, commencing
September 18 and closing December 31, 1895. With this in view it
became necessary for many of the curators to devote a large share of
the year to the preparation of suitable exhibits. A description of these
will accompany the report of the Assistant Secretary for 1896.

Large and important accessions have been received, as usual, from
the United States Geological Survey, the Department of Agriculture,
the Bureau of Ethnology, and the U.S. Fish Commission.

It is gratifying to note that Dr. William L. Abbott and Mr. William
Astor Chanler and Lieut. von Hohnel have continued to contribute
valuable collections of ethnological and natural history objects, obtained
in connection with their respective explorations in Africa and India.
The Museum still enjoys the cooperation of several officials of the Geo-
logical Survey, the Department of Agriculture, and the Fish Commis-
Sion aS honorary curators of collections.

About 127,000 specimens have been added to the collections during
the year. In view of the fact that no special effort has been made to
acquire material, this large addition would be very gratifying if the
conditions were such that it were possible to administer it properly.

In the Appendix accompanying this report some of the most impor-
tant operations of the Museum during the year are briefly referred to.
The report of the Assistant Secretary in charge of the National Museum,
constituting the second volume of the Smithsonian Report, discusses
fully the work of the Museum during the year.

BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOLOGY.

The researches upon the ethnology of the American Indians have
been carried forward, as heretofore, under the direction of Maj. J. W.
Powell. Asin previous years, a certain amount of field exploration
has been carried on. Especially interesting have been the results of the
expedition in the arid region in Arizona and Sonora, Mexico, known
as Papagueria, lying south of the Gila River, west of the Sierra Madre.
The region first visited was that occupied by the Papago Indians; nearly
all of their villages and rancherias were examined and a number of pre-
historic ruins were discovered, among them those of villages with
extensive irrigation works. Subsequently was visited the domain of
the Seri Indians, occupying Tiburon Island in the Gulf of California,
and a considerable region of the adjacent mainland in western Sonora.

The Papago Indians are peaceful and represent the higher grade of
aboriginal intelligence among the inhabitants of Mexico and Central
America; the Seris are savage and primitive in their habits, being prob-
ably the least advanced of the North American tribes still remaining.
The archeological results of the collections obtained are of special
interest, since the region is very peculiar and but partially known.

The surveys in the Canyon de Chelly, referred to in previous reports,
were completed during the year, and an account of the work will soon
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 23

be published, which it is hoped will be an important contribution to
our knowledge of the origin and early history of the cliff dwellings
and pueblos of the Southwest.

Experts have also been engaged in the Indian Territory during the
year investigating the heraldic systems and the calendars of the Kiowa
Indians: Toward the close of the year a special expedition was sent
to excavate the ruins of the pueblos in the little-known country south-
west of Flagstaff and at Tusayan, in northeastern Arizona. This sec-
tion was under the charge of Dr. J. Walter Fewkes, and the results,
so far as reported, have been exceedingly important.

The death of Col. Garrick Mallery interrupted for the time the work
of the Bureau in the investigation of Indian sign languages. The
study of the Mexican codices and inscriptions has been continued, and
an important paper on the Maya year has been published.

As during previous years, especial attention has been paid to the
study of myths, beliefs, and ceremonials, especially those of the Zuni
Indians, who are particularly interesting by reason of the important
part played by mythology in their organizations.

The illness of Mr. James C. Pilling, the distinguished specialist, who
has for many years had charge of the bibliographical work of the
Bureau, has for a time put an end to the publication of bibliographical
material. It is fortunate that so much of the important work of Mr.
Pilling has already been completed and printed.

The study of the aboriginal languages, which has from the beginning
been a most important branch of the work of the Institution, has been
carried forward uninterruptedly, and has resulted in a preliminary
classification of the Indian tribes. During the year a large amount of
new material has been permanently recorded and satisfactory progress
has been made in the arrangement of the vocabularies and grammars
already collected. The Bureau has in its fireproof vaults several hun-
dred valuable manuscripts pertaining to the Indian languages which
are available for the use of students, pending the work of editing and
publication. The Bureau has also suffered a severe loss in this depart-
ment of the work in the death of Rev. J. Owen Dorsey.

In addition to the special branches of investigation already referred
to, much has been done in the assembling and classifying ot informa-
tion concerning the Indian tribes.

Satisfactory progress was made in the publication of the results of
the Bureau’s researches during the year. Hight complete volumes,
comprising 10 papers, covering nearly 2,000 pages, with 674 illustra-
tions, were received from press and in part distributed, and other
volumes were made ready for the Public Printer.

Further details concerning the operations of the Bureau may be
found in the statement of Director Powell, which accompanies this
report as Appendix II.
24 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

THE SMITHSONIAN INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE.

In making arrangements for the distribution of its early publications
the Smithsonian Institution was led to establish relations with foreign
scientific societies and libraries, which have proved of very great value
in giving effect to one of the principal aims of its founder, “the diffu-
sion of knowledge.”

In England and Germany, with which the most active exchange of
scientific literature has always been maintained, it has been found
necessary to establish special agents, who devote a large part of
their time to the Institution’s interests.

There thus exists a channel of communication between this and for-
eign countries by means of which societies or individuals engaged in
the promotion of scientific work can exchange publications practically
without expense.

The extent of the service is best illustrated, though yet imperfectly,
by the accompanying map of the world, which conveys an idea of how
the more than 24,000 correspondents of the exchange service are dis-
tributed. Upon such a small scale the precise statistical distribution
can not, of course, be shown.

The Smithsonian exchange service, which at first was mainly for the
distribution of scientific publications, underwent an important change
when it became the agency for the United States Government in the
exchange of its parliamentary documents for similar documents of for-
eign Governments, and though Congress now makes annually an appro-
priation for carrying out the provisions of a treaty formally entered into
by our Government to maintain a bureau for “the free transmission of
the works exchanged,” these appropriations have never been sufficient
to meet the entire expense involved, and the service is only kept up by
continuing to rely upon the generosity of many of the ocean steamship
lines, which in the early days of its existence granted to the Institu-
tion the privilege of free transportation in recognition of its disinter-
ested and important scientific work.

The important change to which I refer lies in the fact that so large.
a proportion! of the books carried now consists of Government publi-
cations, such, for instance, as the Congressional Record and reports;
indeed, in the transmission of such documents alone the Institution
has in past years expended of its own private fund over $38,000,” for
which it has never been reimbursed.

The appropriation for the past year having been restored to its former
amount of $17,000, and slightly increased amounts having been made
available to certain Government bureaus for the distribution of their

1The exchange of Government documents is about 70 per cent of the entire
exchange work.

We or

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 25

reports, it became possible to bring up the arrears of work to which
I called especial attention in my last report.

The disbursements on account of the expenses of the exchange office
during the year amounted to $21,090.61, of which $16,997.99 were paid
from the appropriation of $17,000 by Congress; $4,092.62 were paid by
Government bureaus or private institutions, the balance at the close
of the fiscal year being held to meet outstanding obligations.

That the exchange service is generously appreciated by its great
number of correspondents in this country, libraries, State and private
institutions, and individuals, I am well aware, but Iam also aware that
with the resources at command it is uot keeping pace with the growth
of the country and the reasonable. expectation of its correspondents
for the prompt transportation that modern facilities warrant. The
improvements that are needed—more foreign agents in the pay of the
Institution, more frequent use of rapid transportation, more clerical
assistance in properly recording and accounting for packages intrusted
to the care of the service—can only be attained by securing from Con-
gress an increased appropriation.

In view of the near approach to completion of the building for the
Library of Congress it would seem desirable that steps should be taken
to secure a more adequate return from foreign Governments for the
large number of publications of the United States sent abroad. How
much can be accomplished in this way that cannot be done by corre-
spondence I personally experienced in a visit made during the past year
in the interest of this Government exchange to the minister of public
instruction in Paris which will, it is hoped, result in securing a very
considerable increase in the number of documents received from the
French Government.

THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

The appropriation made for this purpose for the service of the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1895, was in the following terms:

National Zoological Park: For continuing the construction of roads,
walks, bridges, water supply, sewerage, and drainage; and for grading,
planting, and otherwise improving the grounds; erecting and repairing
buildings and inclosures for animals; and for administrative purposes,
care, subsistence, and transportation of animals, including salaries
or compensation of all necessary employees, and general incidental
expenses not otherwise provided for, fifty thousand doilars; one-half of
which sum shall be paid from the revenues of the District of Columbia
and the other half from the Treasury of the United States; and here-
after a report in detail of the expenses on account of the National
Zoological Park shall be made to Congress at the beginning of each
regular session.

The appropriation was not made until August 18, 1894, when the
working season was already considerably advanced, and this led to
delay and uncertainty in the plans for the year, and owing to this and
26 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

the limited amount no change in the character of the development has
seemed advisable. It may accordingly be said that the principal aim
of the past year has been to keep the animals on hand in proper healthy
condition and to improve the general appearance of the park as much
as practicable with the limited funds available.

The general agitation of the question of a proper system of streets
and roadways in the District of Columbia which has occurred during
the last year, owing to the passage of an act authorizing the District
Commissioners to establish such a system, has had its effect upon the
park in an indirect manner, as it has led to a fuller consideration of
the means of access to the park and its probable development in the
future.

In the District act of August 7, 1894, the following appropriation was
made:

For opening entrance into Zoological Park, from Woodley Lane road,
and opening driveway into Zoological Park, from said entrance along
the west bank of Rock Creek, two thousand five hundred dollars, to be
paid wholly from the revenues of the District of Columbia.

As this appropriation was associated with others relating solely to
District affairs and was payable wholly from District revenues, it
seemed proper that the disbursement of the funds should be made by
the District Commissioners, who commenced the construction of the
roads described in the act.

With the desire that the road might finally come under the control
of the park, Mr. H. P. Waggaman, a property owner in that vicinity
presented to the park a strip of land, as shown in the plat herewith
submitted. (See W.) This addition amounted to 1.217 acres, increas-
ing the total area of the park to 168.70 acres.

The appropriation was wholly insufficient to complete the roadway,
and an additional amount was appropriated for the prosecution of this
work by the sundry civil act of March 2, 1895, in the following terms:

For continuing the entrance into the Zoological Park from Woodley
Lane, and opening driveway into Zoological Park, from said entrance
along the west bank of Rock Creek, five thousand dollars, to be imme-
diately available, which sum is hereby appropriated out of any money
in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, one-half chargeable to the
revenues of the District of Columbia.

In accordance with the terms of this appropriation the work on this
road was continued, and there is at present a heavy fill completed from
the Woodley road down into the park. With the very steep grade at
this point it has not been possible to do more than to rough out this
road, and it is hardly practicable for carriages. In order to complete
it a still greater fill should be made, the road should be macadamized,
and a sidewalk constructed. It will then be necessary to construct a
bridge across the creek at the point marked A, as the steep cliff on the
right side of the creek where the road now ends makes it impracticable
“TAGOI| WOYS “HYVd WWOIDO1OOZ IVWNOILVN JO MalA SAS-S.0ulg

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 2F

to carry the road any farther on that bank. Having crossed the creek,
the road should continue along the stream on the left bank, traversing
the region where the Adams mill formerly stood, and then, as it again
reaches a precipitous bank, it should cross on another bridge at or near
the point marked B, and communicate with the system of roads now
established in the park.

As this road will probably become in time one of the main drives
through the park system, it should be well built, have easy grades, and
be provided with bridges not only of a substantial character but suit-
able otherwise to the scenery in which they are to stand, leading as the
road does through one of the most beautiful and picturesque valleys in
the vicinity of Washington.

Plans for a system of roadways for the District have been completed
for that section lying to the eastward of the park. Here a broad street,
to be known as the “Park Drive,” reaches the boundary of the park
at its southeastern corner and thence proceeds along the eastern
side by gentle curves adapted to the topography of the region, as
shown upon the accompanying plan. The establishment of this road
will greatly improve the access to the park, which has always suffered
from the steep grades that are necessary for descent into the valley
of Rock Creek. It will, however, entail some new difficulties which
should be met at once. The road does not skirt the boundary of the
park at all points, but touches or leaves it according to the contour
of the ground and the practicability of the grade. Some tracts of land
are therefore left between the drive and the park, and if these become
built upon, a succession of private houses will be thrust directly upon
the boundary, marring the air of seclusion that was one of the objects
for which the expenditure of the first purchase was made, and which
is still a principal attraction of the valley.

In order to avoid this the land in question should be added to the
park, the eastern boundary of which would then lie along a broad and
excellent roadway affording access to the park at several convenient
points. The accompanying map shows the land which should be added.
It involves a strip (C) lying immediately south of the bear pits much
needed for the security of the animals confined there. At present the
boundary of the park is so near the pits that the bank is very steep, and
as it is composed in considerable degree of soil and decomposed rock it
constantly crumbles under the action of the weather and precipitates
loose stones and débris into the pits thus endangering the safety of the
animals and gradually undermining the boundary fence, which must
sooner or later fall inward. It should also include a tract of land lying
on a hillside to the north of the Quarry road and forming a portion of
the property of Mr. H. D. Walbridge. This is an exceedingly impor-
tant tract, as its possession would extend the park toward Kenesaw
avenue, which will doubtless be the principal route of access upon the
eastern side, and it would be desirable to extend the park on the
28 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

southern side by taking in the cemetery that now lies near the Adams
mill entrance and constitutes a serious blot upon the surroundings of
the park.

The following letter from the landscape architects, Messrs. Olmsted,
Olmsted & Eliot, sets forth the advantages of the additions upon the
eastern side of the park, and may be considered in connection with
the plan just referred to, and the adjoining bird’s-eye view, the same
letters in each case indicating the same features:

DEAR SIR: We have at various times since our first employment in
connection with the Zoological Park strongly urged that more land
be acquired in order to secure a suitable boundary at various points.

Having been employed a year or more in connection with the plans
for the extension of the street system in the city of Washington, we
gave considerable study to the question of suitable boundary streets
on the east side of the Zoological Park, and in designing these streets
we were governed largely by regard for the desirability of adding to
the Zoological Park with a view to improving its landscape borders.

It is generally recognized that the Zoological Park is not solely a
piece of ground of sufficient area for the proper maintenance and exhi-
bition of living animals, but that it possesses remarkable landscape
beauties and includes a considerable part of one of the most charac-
teristic topographical features of Washington, namely, Rock: Creek,
winding picturesquely among unusually high hills and with beautiful,
wooded slopes.

It is obvious, therefore, that in securing land primarily for the pur-
pose of a zoological park it would be a great waste of a most valuable
opportunity not to secure also, to be preserved for the enjoyment of the
public, the scenery of Rock Creek and the adjoining slopes. This pur-
pose was undoubtedly constantly had in view at the time the Zoological
Park was purchased, but unfortunately, owing to the inadequacy of
the funds then available, some pieces of land of vital importance in the
landscape had to be omitted.

The land which it is of most pressing importance to add as soon as
possible to the park lies along the eastern boundary from a point near
the southeast corner to Kenyon street. This addition may, if necessary,
be secured in three stages.

The most important is a narrow strip (C) above the abandoned quar-
ries now occupied in part as the bear pits, and extending from the end
of the southerly branch of Summit road to the Quarry road. Above
the solid ledge in the old quarries there is a constantly disintegrating
stratum of rock, the face of which is nearly vertical, and from which
pieces of rock of considerable size are frequently falling through the
action of the weather, endangering people’s lives, and also the animals
in the cages below and the property of the park. Above this disinte-
grating rock is a bank of hard earth, approaching the consistency of
stone, which stands at an angle much steeper than engineers would re-
gard assafe. This bank can not be sloped back to a gentler inclination,
because the top of it ends immediately at the boundary of the park,
and it would be a serious damage to the private lands adjoining to have
the present surface lowered. We believe that no one examining the
matter on the ground would hesitate a moment in acknowledging that
an addition to the Zoological Park at this point is a pressing necessity
for safety, aside from any consideration of benefit to the landscape and
suitability of appearance.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 29

The land (D) proposed to be added to the Zoological Park from
Quarry road to Kenyon street is of great importance in the landscape
from almost all parts of the park. It would be a great misfortune if
this land were to be occupied and built upon for private residences.
Houses and other constructions on this steep, open hillside, close to the
creek and facing toward the most used portions of the Zoological Park,
would be excessively conspicuous and destructive of the landscape,
which woald otherwise have a most unusual degree of continuity and
completeness.

The southerly section (E) of the proposed addition to the Zoological
Park, extending from the southerly branch of Summit road to a point
near the southeast boundary ot the Zoological Park, is a very desira-
ble addition to the park, not only for landscape reasons above referred
to, but also because if occupied by private residences they would almost
necessarily back upon the park, and owing to their high position and
the lack of sufficient woods on the steep slopes south of the quarried
they would be annoyingly conspicuous from a large part of the park.

One important object to be attained by the whole of the proposes,
addition on the easterly side of the Zoological Park is that of securing
a frontage upon the new public street recently laid out, and which is
from Ontario avenue northward practically an extension of Highteenth
street. The importance of having a public park bound upon public
streets instead of against back yards of houses is generally recognized
and would alone justify the proposed addition to the park, even if it
was not of enormous advantage to the general landscape of the park.

In conclusion, we wish to point out that if the reasons which we have
given for the proposed addition are sound ones, and if it is conceded
that it should be made very soon because the required land is in a
neighborhood which is rising rapidly in value, and which is being
rapidly built upon, delay will not only involve additional expense for
land and probably much in excess of the interest on its probable present
cost, but also there is a strong probability that if the addition is not
made at once there will be the cost of new houses and other improve-
ments tobe met. * * *

Yours, respectfully,
OLMSTED, OLMSTED & ELIOT.

The amount of land that would be added to the park by these vari-
ous additions is as follows:

The adjustment of the boundaries of the park and the final estab-
lishment of the roads that lead to it will naturally make it necessary
to devise a system. of roads within the park connecting with the en-
trance. This can not be fully done until the exterior roads are finally
Settled, upon the western as well as upon the eastern side. One road
has, however, been contemplated, leading from the Adams Mill entrance
through the grounds to communicate with the road already adverted
to running up the valley from the Woodley Lane road. <A small appro-
priation was set aside for this purpose by the act of March 2, 1895.
This will not be available until the beginning of the next fiscal year.
30 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

EXTINCTION OF THE BUFFALO.

When the Yellowstone Park was organized it was believed that a
permanent place of refuge for the buffalo had been secured, and that
out of the natural increase of the hundreds then remaining represent-
ative herds would be preserved for future generations. It seems now
evident that the conditions in the Yellowstone region are such that the
extermination of the Government herd of buffalo may be anticipated,
and that it may be accomplished within a very short space of time. The
superintendent of the Park appears not to have adequate means for
their protection, and there are on the border plenty of persons whose
respect for law is insufficient to keep them from poaching when the
prize is a buffalo head or skin which will readily sell for several hun-
dreds of dollars. The temptation to these men seems to be irresistible,
and as the herd diminishes the value of the animals increases and the
difficulty of protection becomes constantly greater.

Since, then, the extermination of the Yellowstone herd seems rapidly
approaching, something should at once be done, that this may not mean
the extinction of the Government control of the species, with the death
of the few specimens now in captivity. Only one course suggests itself
as completely efficient—transference of the great part of the now few
remaining animals to a region where they can be effectively protected
and increase normally under natural conditions, in which case the
bison need not vanish from the face of the earth. ‘Two years ago there
were supposed to be 200 in the Yellowstone Park. The present esti-
mate is one-quarter of thatnumber. The superintendent reports them
as being “constantly pursued,” and in another year there may be none
left. If these animals, or a majority of them, can during the next few
months be transferred to the National Zoological Park at Washington,
which affords room and security, they will be safe, and their natural
increase in the future can be distributed by exchange with the zoolog-
ical gardens of the various parts of the United States, so that no large
city need be without its representatives of the great herds so often
referred to in our early history, and now a memory.

Having in mind certain statements made in the public press with
regard to the slaughter of the bison within the Yellowstone National
Park by marauding poachers, I addressed to Capt. George S. Anderson,
U.S. A., the superintendent of that park, a letter of inquiry, to which
he made the following reply, which is of interest as supplementing the
information given in his annual report to the Secretary of the Interior,
and which, though properly belonging to a later report, I give here on
account of its urgent importance:

December 12, 1895.

I can give you no definite information about the bison in the Hayden
Valley, near your corral. My scouting parties have reported the trails
of several small bands leading in that direction, but as the snowfall
has been light, they have not as yet been driven to that narrow area.
| BUFFALO IN NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL PARK.

‘REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. . 31

I do not expect to be able to get an accurate estimate of their number
before the latter part of January. I hope there are enough remaining
for a source of supply for your park, and if they can be inclosed the
cost of maintenance will be very small.

The reports made through the newspapers of the slaughter of the
bison recently are, of course, much exaggerated, but unfortunately
several have been killed. I feel pretty certain that ten were killed
within the past four months. I have now in custody in the guard-
house a man who was captured in possession of the scalps of five.

I made a pretty thorough tour of their range in October last, and saw
very few signs. Iam sure that I have heretofore overestimated their
numbers. I doubt if there are over fifty remaining, and these will not
all winter in the Hayden Valley. They increase but slowly under the
best conditions, and here, where they are being constantly pursued and
where the winters are very severe, but small increase can be looked for.
Of course, the stockade recently erected will be a great assistance in
their protection, if they can be secured within it.

Allof the animals in the park are protected properly and are increas-
ing, with the exception of the bison, and of these it is difficult to predict
as yet.

There are now but seven of these animals in the National Park here,
and even these are a relatively considerable part of the extremely small
pure-blooded stock which represents the vanished herds which once
covered this continent. An illustration of the head of one of them is
given herewith. The present value of such animals being over $1,000,
the value of these remaining 50 buffaloes in the Yellowstone is then over
$50,000. If so much national property can be saved by the appropri-
ation of one-tenth of that amount, should not this be done on the
ground of economy alone; and if, by spending on their transportation
little more than the expense of shipping a few carloads of beef cattle,
these bison may be saved from extinction, is it not worth while?

The threatened decrease of the collection of animals in the park is
a constant source of anxiety. As under the existing appropriations
no purchases can be made, recourse is naturally had to the preserves
in the Yellowstone Park, from which a number of valuable animals
have already been obtained. .

The number of persons that avail themselves of the advantages of the
park increases year by year, and it seems proper that more adequate
provision should be made for the collection than now exists. New
buildings suitable for special classes of animals are especially desirable.
A suitable elephant house should be built without delay, also an aviary
for the accommodation of both native and foreign birds. The property
yard, in which are included a blacksmith’s and a carpenter’s shop, should
be removed from the site it now occupies to some less conspicuous
location. The following appropriation was made in the District act of
August 7, 1894:

For continuing the construction of the Rock Creek intercepting sewer,
twenty thousand dollars: Provided, That the Commissioners of the
District of Columbia are authorized to enter into contract for said work

‘

32 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

at a cost not to exceed eighty thousand dollars, to be paid for from time
to time as appropriations may be made by law; and the said Com-
missioners are authorized to construct said sewer, where necessary,
across lands belonging to the United States: Provided, That after the
construction of said sewer the.excavated portions of said lands shall
be restored to their original condition from the appropriation herein
provided for.

In accordance with this law the Commissioners of the District pro-
ceeded to survey a course for an intercepting sewer along Rock Creek
within the limits of the park. While the engineers in charge of the
work have conducted their operations with discretion and courtesy the
circumstance has brought forcibly to my attention the desirability of
clearly defining the authority of the park officials in cases where it
becomes necessary for employees from other branches of the Govern-
ment to carry on work within the park. There is a very real danger
that engineering operations may be conducted so as to injure the ani-
mals and destroy the natural beauties of the region, making it impossible
to ‘‘restore the land to its original condition.” As conflict of authority
would seriously embarrass the work it would be well if in future
cases of this kind the law should specifically provide that operations
should be conducted under such reasonable regulations of the park
authorities as may insure, as far as practicable, the safety of the ani-
mals and the preservation of the natural features of the park.

Immediately subsequent to the date of this report one of the most
interesting and valuable animals of the park (a sea lioness) died from
fright, due to an explosion without. warning caused in the progress of
the work just referred to.

ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY.

The investigation of the infra-red spectrum has been continued in the
Astro-physical Observatory during the past year with increased energy,
and Lam glad to be able to say that if only provisional results have
yet been published, which, like those of last year’s report, are intended
merely to show the character and progress of the work, it is because
the means of giving greater exactness are constantly growing, so that
the result it is now hoped to present will be given with the aim of a
still higher standard of precision; an aim which it may be trusted will
be considered a legitimate cause for the delay in the appearance of the
final results.

I refer for all details to the more extended report given later, but,
briefly, it may be stated that a larger number of bolographic records
has been obtained than in any previous year, and that these continuous
observations have been accompanied by further improvement in the
apparatus, a higher standard of accuracy, and a nearer approach to
the completion of the research; but that they have also shown beyond
a doubt that the limit of accuracy which is desirable can never be

reached in the present most unsuitable, provisional site, which is sub-
ject to every kind of disturbance due to the neighborhood of the streets
of a busy city.

NECROLOGY.

I am called upon to record here the death of two Regents of the
Institution, Dr. James C. Welling and Dr. Henry Coppée; also three
gentlemen long associated with the work of the Institution, Mr. Will-
iam B. Taylor, Col. Garrick Mallery, and Rev. James Owen Dorsey,
besides Mr. Robert Stanton Avery, who has bequeathed his estate to
the Institution.

JAMES CLARK WELLING.

I have lost in Dr. Welling a personal friend, but I only have to
speak of him now in his relationship to this Institution—an institution
whose character has been partly due to its good fortune in the presence
and advice of such men.

Dr. Welling was one who possessed, beyond anyone else, what may
be called the traditions of the Institution; and though these were not
of course his exclusive property, in this respect, as in others, his loss
can not be supplied.

The rules of conduct which have been laid down by the Regents, and
by the Secretaries who have administered them, are not so much derived
from a priori views as they are the outgrowth of accumulated experi-
ence; and this experience, it has been thought, is in part, due to the
exceptionally long incumbencies of members of the Board as compared
with ordinary tenures of office here, and to the continuity of the knowl-
edge of its activities, as ilustrated in the case of this departed friend.

James Clark Welling, at the time of his death, September 4, 1894,
was nearly 70 years of age.! Descended from New England colonial
ancestors, a native of one of the Middle States, in early manhood a
teacher in the South, and for nearly half a century a resident of the
national capital, he was an American of the best type, free from sec-
tional bias, personifying the higher traits and tendencies of the nation,
loyal to the traditions and aspirations of its founders.

He was graduated in 1844 from the College of New Jersey, studied
law, and was admitted to the bar, but soon afterwards entered upon the
profession of journalism. He always retained, however, a strong incli-
nation for the study of constitutional and international law, and of
politics, and his interest in public affairs was greatly stimulated by his
connection for fifteen years with the most important of Washington
journals, at that time national in its influence. He became the literary
editor of the National Intelligencer in 1850, and was its managing

1He was born in Trenton, July 14, 1825.
sm 95——3
34 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

editor throughout the entire period of the civil war. In this capacity
he had the privilege of personal acquaintance with all our public men,
and confidential access to many of them, including Lincoln, Seward,
and Stanton.

In later life his attention was given chiefly to educational work.
For a time president of St. John’s College, Maryland, and later pro-
fessor of belles lettres at Princeton, he was, in 1870, recalled to Wash-
ington to become president of the Columbian University, an institution
tounded fifty years before, in the hope that it might fulfill the desire of
Washington, Barlow, and Adams, that a seat of liberal learning should
exist at the capital. Dr. Welling was led to accept this position by
the urgency of the philanthropist Corcoran and the advice of Henry,
both of whom were influenced by the hope of having with them one of
the founders of a national university, and who believed that a man
of Dr. Welling’s character would find in such a position a wide field of
influence.

His aspirations for the university were never fully realized, owing to
the impossibility of securing endowments from private sources for a
public institution located so near to the seat of Government. He never-
theless secured a considerable addition to its endowment, added new
professional schools, greatly increased the number of its faculty and
students, removed the institution from the suburbs to a new building
in the heart of the city, and accomplished many other things which
seemed really wonderful in view of the smallness of the resources at
his command. The dream of his life was to establish a school of com-
parative jurisprudence—the only one of its kind in the world—as a
branch of the university. In 1892 he visited Europe, secured approval
of his plans from Sir Frederick Pollock and other eminent jurists, and
their promise to come to America to lecture as members of the faculty.
Failing health interfered with the realization of his pian, which, I can
but believe, he would have otherwise forced into success.

After his resignation of the presidency in 1893, he still retained the
chair of international law and the position of dean of the university
law school, and, full of hopefulness, it was his purpose to labor on for
his beloved project. He confidently expected to live to be 80, and to
devote the remaining ten years of his life to the compilation of a polit-
ical history of the civil war, a work for which no one was so well qual-
ified by experience, knowledge, and critical skill as himself. He was a
representative man in Washington, identified with all interests which
tend toward good citizenship, and held many positions of public trust
and honor. He was president of the board of trustees of the Corcoran
Art Gallery and of the American Copyright League, and was appointed
by President Harrison commissioner to the Columbian Historical Expo-
sition at Madrid in 1892. His scholarship was accurate, broad, and
genial, aS was shown by the critical reviews which he contributed dur-
ing his later years to some of the principal American journals. His
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 35

favorite study in hours of relaxation was that of the sacred poetry of
the early Christian Church, some of which he had translated, though
not for publication.

In 1884 he was chosen a Regent of this Institution, to succeed the
Reverend Dr. Parker. For ten years he gave conscientious attention
to its interests, and upheld in every way those conservative and dig-
nified traditions of which I have already spoken of him as almost the
living embodiment; and while he did this primarily because of their
harmony with his own personal tendencies and convictions as to their
value, he did so because of his affection and reverence for the first
Secretary, Joseph Henry, whose pupil he had been in his youth, and
with whom in middle life he maintained the relation of friend and con-
fident. After Henry’s death, Dr. Welling consented to add to his
already burdensome duties those of the chairman of the executive com-
mittee, which he performed till his own death, so that he may be said
to have been a link between the past and present in the history of this
Institution, though happily not the only one, since it has preserved
others in his contemporaries.

Ata meeting of the Board of Regents in January, 1895, the following
resolutions were adopted:

Whereas the members of the Board of Regents of the Smithsonian
Institution have been called upon to mourn the death of their esteemed
colleague, the late James C. Welling, LL. D., president of Columbian
University, who has long been interested in the welfare of the Insti-
tution, and who for many years has been a Regent and chairman of its
executive committee,

Resolved, That the Board of Regents feel deep regret in the loss of
one whose long and distinguished career of public usefulness, especially
in the promotion of institutions for higher education, commanded their
respect, and whose personal character and unselfish devotion to the
highest ideals of scholarship and citizenship, their sincere admiration.

Resolved, That in the death of President Welling the Smithsonian
Institution has suffered the irreparable loss of an earnest friend, a wise
and judicious counselor, and one who was preeminently an exponent
of its time-honored policy, and the Board of Regents a friend and
associate whom they valued most highly.

Resolved, That these resolutions be recorded in the journal of the
proceedings of the Board, and that the secretary be requested to send
a copy of them to the family of their departed associate and friend, in
token of sympathy in this common affliction.

HENRY COPPEE.

Henry Coppée, LL. D., a member of the executive committee of the
Board of Regents of the Institution, died March 21, 1895, in his seventy-
fourth year. He was appointed Regent January 19, 1874, was reap-
pointed by Congress every six years, and during that score of years
_ constantly took the deepest interest in the work of the Institution.

_ Dr. Coppée was born in Savannah, Ga., October 13, 1821, and was
of French ancestry.

36 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

After spending two years in the class of 1839 at Yale, he left college
to study practical civil engineering, being engaged in the construction
of the Georgia Central Railroad. July 1, 1840, he entered the United
States Military Academy at West Point, from which place he was
graduated four years later, being promoted to second lieutenant of
artillery July 1, 1845. The following year, after having served in gar-
rison, and at Fort Columbus, N. Y., he was sent to Mexico, taking part
in the battles of Vera Cruz, Cerro Gordo, Cherubusco, and Contreras
in 1847, being then promoted to the rank of first lieutenant and breveted
captain for “gallant and meritorious conduct” in those battles.

Dr. Coppée was assistant professor of French at West Point Acad-
emy from August 22, 1848, to June 22, 1849, and after spending a year
at Fort McHenry, Md., he returned to West Point and remained there
five years as assistant professor of English studies. On June 30, 1855,
he resigned from the Army, and for eleven years was professor of
English literature at the University of Pennsylvania, when in 1866 he
was elected the first president of Lehigh University. His love for lit-
erary rather than administrative labor induced him to resign the presi-
dency of the university in 1875, and to accept the chair of English
literature, international and constitutional law, and the philosophy of
history. Upon the death of President Lamberton in 1893 he again
became head of the university, and was acting president when he died.

He was an industrious author, his published works covering a wide
range of subjects, though pertaining chiefly to history and English
literature.

His genial courtesy and manly disposition, the prudent counsel of his
disciplined and well-stored mind, and his devotion to the interests of the
Institution will linger in the memory of his colleagues on the Board of
Regents. As a soldier, as man of letters, as professor and president of
a great university, Dr. Coppée won high distinction, and died leaving
a record of well spent years. .

ROBERT STANTON AVERY.

Robert Stanton Avery, of Washington City, was born near Preston,
Conn., May 1, 1808, and died in Washington on September 12, 1894. He
early became interested in mathematics and physical science and in
Latin and Greek, and for several years was engaged in teaching school
in various parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts, and also in Ohio
and Kentucky. Actuated by a desire for higher education he entered
Harvard College at the age of 35 and there devoted much of his time
to a critical study of the Scriptures in Greek and Hebrew. After his
graduation in 1846 he obtained a license as a preacher, but failing health
prevented active work in that profession.

From 1853 to 1885 he was connected with the United States Coast
Survey, his principal work being computation and reduction of tidal
observations.
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ot

After resigning from the Government service he prepared for the press
a set of mathematical tables, also some schoolbooks designed for the
teaching of phonetic spelling, a subject in which he became much inter-
ested, and in establishing ‘‘The Avery fund” of the Smithsonian Institu-
tion he expressed a wish that the income be used chiefly for publications
relating to the mechanical laws governing an etherial medium and also
mathematical tables and works on phonetic type and writing.

WILLIAM BOWER TAYLOR.

William Bower Taylor, who died February 25, 1895, was appointed
assistant and editor in the Smithsonian Institution in 1878, He was
born in Philadelphia May 23, 1821; graduated at the University of
Pennsylvania in 1840; studied law and was admitted to the bar Novem-
ber 15, 1843. In 1853 he came to Washington as draftsman and fore-
man of the engineer and machinist departments at the United States
navy-yard, and in 1854 was appointed principal examiner, and later
librarian, in the United States Patent Office. He was one of the
founders and the fourth president of the Washington Philosophical
Society, and was a member of the American Philosophical Society, the
American Association for the Advancement of Science, and of other
learned bodies. He represented the Smithsonian Institution at the
International Electrical Exhibition in Philadelphia in 1884. Among
his literary works may be mentioned the Life and Writings of Prof.
Joseph Henry; Professor Henry and the Telegraph, and papers on
Gravitation, Force, and Sound, published by the Institution.

Necrologic notices of Col. Garrick Mallery and James Owen Dorsey,
for many years connected with the Bureau of Ethnology, are given by
the Director of the Bureau in an appendix to this report.

Respectfully submitted.

APPENDIX TO SECRETARY’S REPORT.

APPENDIX I.
THE NATIONAL MUSEUM.

Srr: I have the honor to present a brief statement of some of the most important
features connected with the operations of the National Museum during the fiscal
year which ended on June 30, 1895.

Accessions.—During the year the collections have been increased by 1,225 accessions,
numbering about 127,000 specimens. This compares favorably with the last four
years. The large increase is almost entirely the result of a warm interest in the wel-
fare of the Museum on the part of individuals, many of whom have at one time or
another received some courtesy from the Museum, either in the way of a publication
or special information on some scientific subject. Collections of more than ordinary
interest have been contributed by Dr. William L. Abbott, Mr. William Astor Chan-
ler, and Lieut. von Héhnel, His Majesty the King of Siam, the Reverend L.T. Cham-
berlain, Mr. A. Boucard, Dr. William L. Ralph, and others. Important gifts have
also been received from the Indian Museum in Calcutta and from the Government of
Nicaragua.

The scientific staff.—During the year all the collections of fossils have been placed
under one curator, and are now administered under the department of paleontology,
of which Hon. C. D. Walcott, Director of the U. 8. Geological Survey, is the hon-
orary curator. The vertebrate fossils are in charge of Prof. O. C. Marsh and Mr.
F. A. Lucas. Among the invertebrate fossils, the Paleozoic collection is under the
care of Mr. Charles Schuchert. The Mesozoic fossils are administered by Mr. T. W.
Stanton, and the Cenozoic, or Tertiary, fossils by Dr. W. H. Dall. The collection of
fossil plants is under the charge of Prof. Lester F. Ward, with Mr. F. H. Knowlton
as custodian of the Mesozoic plants and Mr. David White as custodian of the Paleo-
zoic plants.

Mr. J. E. Watkins has been appointed curator of all the technological collections.
Dr. J. M. Flint, of the United States Navy, has been again detailed by the Secretary
of the Navy to serve as honorary curator of the section of materia medica, in place of
Medical Inspector Daniel McMurtrie. Dr. J. N. Rose, of the Department of Agri-
culture, has been appointed honorary assistant curator of the department of plants.
Dr. Walter Hough, Mr. C. W. Richmond, and Miss M. J. Rathbun, have been desig-
nated assistant curators in the departments of ethnology, birds, and marine inverte-
brates, respectively. Mr. F. H. Cushing, of the Bureau of Ethnology, has been
designated custodian of the Pueblo collections.

Distribution of collections.—There have been 39,236 duplicate specimens distributed
during the past year to universities, colleges, museums, and,in a few special instances,
to normal schools. This shows an increase of about 13,000 specimens over the dis-
tributions of last year. The material distributed consisted principally of rocks and
ores, invertebrate forms of marine life, fishes, casts of prehistoric implements, and
minerals. Morethan half the total number consisted of marine invertebrates. Large
quantities of marine forms are collected by the U.S. Fish Commission, and as soon as

40 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

practicable after the material has been studied and transferred to the Museum, selec-
tionsare carefully made with a view to the preparation of ‘‘sets” fordistribution. I+
is quite impossible, however, to fill more than a small proportion of the applications
received, until Congress makes a special appropriation to be used for the employment
_ of experts in separating the duplicates in the various departments of the Museum
and arranging them into collections especially suited for use in educational work.

Visitors.—There has been an increase of nearly 8,000 in the number of visitors to
the Smithsonian and Museum buildings during the year. The total for the Smith-
sonian building was 105,658, and for the Museum building 201,744.

Specimens transmitted for identification.—During the year 467 “lots” of specimens
were forwarded to the Museum for examination. Only a very small proportion
proved desirable for permanent addition to the collections. If the specimens sent
have any value, their return is almost invariably requested. If, however, the
Museum is permitted to retain desirable specimens, they are recorded in the Museum
catalogues, first as received for examination and report, and again as gifts to the
Museum. It is rarely the case that specimens thus retained have any intrinsic
worth, their value usually consisting in the fact that they fill gaps in certain series.
During the past year the services of the curators in examining and reporting upon
material were extended, outside of the United States, to correspondents in Canada,
Great Britain, Central America, South America, Mexico, Australia, New Zealand,
India, Java, Borneo, Philippine Islands, several countries of Europe, and various
islands in the Pacific Ocean.

Foreign exchanges.—Exchanges have been made with several foreign museums
during the year. Among them are the Royal Museum of Northern Antiquities,
Copenhagen, Denmark; Indian Museum, Calcutta, India; Canterbury Museum,
Christchurch, New Zealand; Museum of Natural History, Paris, France; Manches-
ter Museum, Manchester, England; Museum of Natural History, Vienna, Austria;
La Plata Museum, Buenos Ayres, Argentina, and others. Important exchanges have .
often been effected with individuals, such as Dr. A. C. Haddon, Cambridge, Eng-
land; Mr. Edgar J. Bradley, Happy Valley Water Works, South Australia; Dr. H. von
Ihering, San Paulo, Brazil; Mr. M. Stossich, Triest, Austria; Prof. Edward Tregear,
of Wellington, New Zealand.

Publications.—The report of the Museum for 1892 has been published during the
year, and the report for 1893 is now going through the press. The papers (976-1032)
constituting volume 17 of the Proceedings of the National Museum have, with one
exception, been distributed, and the edition of the bound volume is expected daily.
Advance sheets of two papers containing descriptions of new species, and intended
for inclusion in volume 18, were issued during the year in order to secure to the
authors priority of description.

Of the Bulletin, No. 48, ‘“‘Contribution toward a Monograph of the Insects of the
Lepidopterous Family Noctuide of Boreal North America, A Revision of the Del-
toid Moths,” by John B. Smith, Sc. D., has been published. The following ‘‘ Parts”
of No. 39 are now in the folding room: Part H, ‘‘ Directions for collecting Minerals,”
by Wirt Tassin; Part I, ‘‘ Directions for collecting Rocks and for the preparation of
Thin Sections,” by George P. Merrill; Part J, “‘ Directions for collecting specimens
and information illustrating the Aboriginal Uses of Plants,” by Frederick V. Coville;
Part K, ‘‘Directions for collecting and preparing Fossils,” by Charles Schuchert.
A supplemental edition of Part A, ‘‘ Directions for collecting Birds,” by Robert
Ridgway, has been printed at the expense of the Museum allotment, in order to
supply the extraordinary demand for this publication.

The second of the series of Special Bulletins, in quarto form, entitled ‘‘ Oceanic
Ichthyology,” relating to the deep sea and pelagic fishes of the world, by G.
Brown Goode and Tarleton H. Bean, has been set in type and will probably be pub-
lished during the winter. The third number of the series, being the second volume
of Life Histories of North American Birds, by Maj. Charles Bendire, is for the most
part in type. It will be illustrated with seven chromo-lithographic plates.
Se

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. Al

Circulars 43 to 46 have been published. Nos. 43 to 45 have reference to the develop-
ment of the library of the National Museum, and request the transmission of the
publications of scientific establishments as well as authors’ separates or reprints. No.
46 invites the cooperation of students and collectors in forwarding plants found in
the District of Columbia, and making notes concerning them, for incorporation in a
proposed revised edition of Bulletin 22, by Prof. Lester F. Ward, entitled A Guide to
the Flora of Washington and Vicinity. This was published in 1881.

Explorations.—The Museum has benefited during the year by the results of the
explorations of Dr. William L. Abbott, who has forwarded valuable ethnological
and natural history material from Africa and India.

Mr. William Astor Chanler has continued his travels in Africa, and has made
important contributions to the collections.

Prof. William Treiease, Director of the Missouri Botanical Garden, St. Louis,
gathered a number of interesting specimens of natural history, including marine
invertebrate forms, reptiles, fishes, birds, and insects, in connection with his expedi-
tion to the Azores.

Large collections of mammals and pottery have resulted from the explorations of
Lieut. Wirt Robinson, U.S. A., in Florida.

Mr. Mark B. Kerr made a very acceptable collection of fossils in Ecuador, which
he presented to the Museum.

Cotton States and International Exposition, Atlanta.—The exhibit prepared under the
auspices of the Smithsonian Institution for display at the Cotton States Exposition
illustrates every phase of the activities of the Institution and its branches, especially
the National Museum. The exhibits of the latter include collections prepared by the
departments of mammals, birds, reptiles, fishes, comparative anatomy, marine inver-
tebrates, mollusks, insects, paleontology, geology, minerals, botany, prehistoric
anthropology, ethnology, and some of the sections of the department of arts and
industries, i. e., materia medica, oriental antiquities and religious ceremonial, some
technological exhibits, and a collection of games. The space assigned to the Institu-
tion includes 5,300 feet of floor space, exclusive of the central aisle, and is located
in the southeastern quarter of the Government building. The sum allotted to the
Smithsonian Institution and the National Museum was $22,000. Of this amount
$16,500 was made available for expenditures connected with the preparation of the
exhibits, the remainder being intended to cover the expenses of installation. The
Exposition opens on September 18 and closes on December 31. The report of the
National Museum for 18.6 will contain a complete description of these exhibits and
a full account of the participation of the Smithsonian Institution and its various
branches.

APPENDIX II.

REPORT OF THE DIRECTOR OF THE BUREAU OF AMERICAN ETHNOL-
OGY FOR THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1895.

Sir: Ethnologic researches have been prosecuted. during the fiscal year in accord
ance with act of Congress making prevision ‘‘ for continuing researches relating to
the American Indians, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution.” The
operations have been conducted in accordance with the plan submitted at the begin-
ning of the fiscal year, with minor modifications made necessary by circumstances,

The primary classification of the work is topical, and the researches along different
lines comprise field studies or exploration and office work in the elaboration of the
material collected in the field or obtained in other ways. The chief researches dur-
ing the last year relate to (1) archeology, (2) descriptive ethnology, (3) sociology,
(4) sign language and hieroglyphics, (5) linguistics, (6) mythology, (7) psychology,
(8) bibliography, and (9) publication, together with administrative and miscellaneous
work.

In the usual course the researches begin in the field, where surveys are made and
where information and material are collected. The data obtained in this way are
studied and compared and reports thereon are written in the office, and the reports
thus prepared are, after examination by the Director or by the ethnologist in charge
under his instructions, transmitted for publication. The scientific operations there-
fore include (1) fieldwork or exploration, (2) office researches, including the prepa-
ration of reports, and (3) publication. :

EXPLORATION.

During the earlier portion of the fiscal year Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff was occupied
in extending and completing his explorations and surveys in southwestern United
States. During the field season of 1894 his operations were largely confined to Can-
yon de Chelly in northeastern Arizona, but his reconnoissances and surveys were
extended into contiguous territory. During July and the earlier part of August he
examined San Juan Valley and there obtained information of much interest. In its
topography and general geographic conditions this region appears to have been well
adapted to the needs of the ancient pueblo builders, and it affords examples of nearly
all the types of aboriginal villages now known, together with other types and many
variants which have not been surveyed elsewhere. The examination and compara-
tive study of these relics throw much light on the development of art in architecture
by the people of the pueblos. In other directions, too, the observations add mate-
rialiy to knowledge of the habits and customs of the aborigines. Mr. Mindeleff’s
researches during the season, in connection with his surveys during the last fiscal
year, have covered a large territory and will permit archeologic mapping of value;
even the negative results are useful as indicating the territory barren of aboriginal
works.

Early in September Mr. Mindeleff brought his field operations to a close. The
greater part of the month was spent in completing his accounts and disposing of his
field outfit and equipment. Toward the end of the month he repaired to Washington
to begin the preparation of a final report on his surveys of the preceding fifteen
months.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 43

The most extended exploratory work of the year was that of an expedition through
the country of the Papago and Seri Indians of Arizona and Sonora (Mexico), con-
ducted by Mr. McGee. The expedition was fitted out in Tucson about the middle
of October. Mr. William Dinwiddie accompanied the expedition as photographer,
and the party included also a Papago Indian interpreter and from time to time Indian
or Mexican guides and interpreters. Leaving Tucson, the party proceeded to and
through San Luis Valley and temporarily crossed the frontier at Sasabe to the
Papago Indian village of Poso Verde. Here the leader and interpreter remained sey-
eral days, collecting information concerning the distribution of the Papago villages
and rancherias, while Mr. Dinwiddie was sent back to Tucson to make necessary
changes in outfit. A few days later the party reassembled at Arivaca, Ariz., where
surveys were made of extended prehistoric works. Thence the expedition moved
to the frontier at Nogales, where after some delay authority for extending the opera-
tions on Mexican soil was courteously accorded, in response to representations made
through the local officials to the federal officers of the Republic of Mexico. Leaving
Nogales, the party proceeded southward, visiting several villages formerly occupied
by Papago Indians but now abandoned, and finding rancherias occupied by repre-
sentatives of the tribe at various points.

The rancherias near Querobabi were found especially interesting, and a number

of valuable photographs were taken. While a primary purpose of the expedition
was the collection of objective material for preservation in the United States
National Museum, little such material was collected during this part of the trip,
(1) because of the desire to comply with the spirit of the Mexican law relating to
the removal of antiquities, and (2) because of the difficulty of transporting objects
over many hundred miles of frequently trackless territory. Other Papago ran-
cherias were found as far southward as Hermosillo, and information was obtained
concerning settlements midway between that city and Guaymas. During the jour-
ney from Tucson to Hermosillo the eastern and southern limits of the Papago ter-
ritory were determined, many of the characteristics of the tribe were ascertained,
and their arts were studied in such manner as to facilitate subsequent collection of
typical objects.

After two or three days’ delay in Hermosillo, due to the difficulty of obtaining
authority to enter the territory of the warlike Seri Indians, the expedition proceeded
toward the coast adjacent to Tiburon Island. During this part of the trip the expe-
dition had the pleasure and advantage of the company of Senor Pascual Encinas, an
aged Mexican, formerly of great energy and courage, who had done much to extend
white settlement into the Seri country, and whose services in this direction have
received abundant recognition on the part of the State and the Republic. Piloted
by Senor Encinas and Senor Alvemar-Leon, the expedition entered the borders of
the Seri territory and was so fortunate as to find a temporary rancheria occupied by
some sixty individuals of the tribe. During the ensuing week their habits and cus-
toms were studied, a part of their vocabulary was recorded, and a number of indi-
vidual and group photographs were made. In addition typical articles of costumery,
weapons, utensils, etc., were collected and some information was gained concerning
the ethnic characteristics of the tribe. The Indians were found quite primitive,
probably more primitive and savage than any other tribe remaining on the North
American continent. Most of their food is eaten raw, they have no domestic animals
save dogs, they are totally without agriculture, and their industrial arts are few
and rude. By reason of their warlike character, little has hitherto been known con-
cerning the tribe; the photographs made by the expedition are the first known to
have been made of the Seri Indians.

Returning to Hermosillo early in November, the party set out on the return
journey, so shaping the course as to determine the southwestern limits of Papago
occupancy. Interesting Papago rancherias were found aé Poso Noriago and at
Cienega, and in both localities photographs and a few small objects of special
interest were obtained. Between these points several prehistoric ruins were dis-

44 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

vocered, and also examples of the singular prehistoric works called by the Mexicans
“las trincheras” (entrenched mountains) observed. Passing northward, the ancient
Papago town of Caborca was visited and additional photographs were made. A
remarkable example of entrenched mountain near this point received careful atten-
tion. From Caborca the expedition proceeded to Pitiquita, where opportunity was
again presented for collecting Papago material, and thence to Altar. The limit of
the time fixed for the journey on leaving Tucson being nearly at hand, and the stock
having suffered greatly from the rigors of travel through one of the most arid of
Tegions, it was found necessary here to abandon the plan for extending the studies
to San Domingo and Quitobaquita, the westernmost settlements of the Papago; and
the expedition proceeded directly toward the boundary near Sierra de la Union,
between Rancho de San Joaquin, in Sonora, and Rancho Ventano, in Arizona.

There are several Papago rancherias near the last-named rancho, and in these col-
lections and photographs were made. The party then proceeded to Fresnal, the
principal Indian village in Papagueria, where the team was loaded with objects
obtained from the Indians. Later, Tucson (Indian) was visited, and afterwards a
stop was made at the Papago village of Coyote. Between the last-named points and
at Coyote prehistoric villages and other antiquities of much interest were noted,
and a small collection of fragmentary prehistoric pottery, etc., was made. On
November 25 the expedition returned to Tucson, and immediately on disbanding the
ethnologist in charge repaired to Washington, Mr. Dinwiddie remaining for a few
days for the purpose of completing collections on the Papago Reservation at San
Xavier. The expedition resulted in a considerable collection representing the arts
and industries of the partially acculturized Papago Indians, whose arts have been
hitherto but meagerly represented in the National Museum or other repositories of
scientific material; in the first noteworthy collection of objective material ever made
among the Seri Indians; in some 500 photographs of the Seri and Papago Indians
and their surroundings, this collection being of special interest since the Seri
Indians have not hitherto been photographed, while few pictures of the Papago
have hitherto been taken; and in a considerable body of ethnic material appertain-
ing to both tribes.

Toward the close of the calendar year Dr. Franz Boas, who had visited British
Columbia for the purpose of continuing researches relating to the native languages
under the auspices of the British Association for the Advancement of Science, com-
municated with the Bureau, suggesting that he be given authority and means for
visiting the Kathlamet Indians of the lower Columbia region and collecting texts
representing their language and mythology. After correspondence he was author-
ized to carry out his plan of operations, the material collected to be conveyed to
the Bureau for a stipulated sum. Dr. Boas devoted several weeks to the work, and
after his return to eastern United States prepared the material for publication. It
was not quite complete at the end of the fiscal year, but was soon afterward trans-
mitted and found to be a valuable addition to knowledge concerning the north-
western tribes.

About the end of December Mr. James Mooney proceeded to the field in Indian
Territory for the purpose of making researches concerning the Kiowa calendar and
the Kiowa heraldic system. He remained dwelling among the Kiowa Indians until
after the close of the fiscal year. Among the Kiowa as among other Plains Indians,
and indeed among all of the aboriginal tribes, there is a widespread symbolism by
which the arts are influenced and guided. Under this symbolism tents, shields,
arrows, pipes, musical instruments, robes, and other articles are inscribed, painted,
or otherwise marked with designs. In many cases these designs possess decorative
value, and by superficial students they are commonly supposed to be used simply
for decoration; but study of the Indian character and motive shows that the design
is not primarily decorative (though the germ of decoration may be found therein),
but symbolic and fraught with meaning to those who understand the symbolism.
This primitive symbolism is found to be developed and differentiated in various
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 45

ways among different tribes of the American aborigines; among the Kiowa Indians
it is differentiated into a crude yet highly significant system of heraldry which
throws much light on the medieval heraldry of Europe; and in another direction it
is differentiated into a system of winter counts or calendars, forming at the same
time a chronologic system and an historical record which, although crude and imper-
fect, are of great interest. Among the same Indians the system of symbolism has
been differentiated in a third direction, though one nearly parallel with the first, in
such manner as to form a symbolic record of social organization and relation, this
part of the record being largely painted on the dressed-skin tents. Thus the sym-
bolism of the Kiowa Indians elucidates the origin of several arts brought to perfec-
tion only among much more highly cultivated people; it represents a crude heraldry,
a budding cronology, a nascent decorative art, and the germ of writing.

Although remaining in the field, Mr. Mooney made considerable progress during
the fiscal year in the preparation of a memoir on the Kiowa calendar, though the
manuscript will require revision as his studies approach maturity, after his return
to the office.

OFFICE WORK.
ARCHEOLOGY.

Prof. W. H. Holmes, who retired from the Bureau before the beginning of the fiscal
year, left two reports nearly ready for publication; one of these relates to the stone
art of the aborigines as exemplified and elucidated by the relics found in and near
the tide-water region adjacent to Chesapeake Bay; the second to the fictile art as
represented by collections from eastern United States, especially from the mounds.
While both reports were substantially complete as to letterpress, they were incom-
plete as to illustrations, and the preparation of requisite illustrations was carried
forward under the supervision of the ethnologist in charge and Mr. DeLancey W.
Gill. During July a number of photographs were made, for incorporation in the
memoir on stone art, by Mr. Cushing and Mr. William Dinwiddie. When the illus-
trations were completed the memoir was incorporated in the Fifteenth Annual
Report of the Bureau, which was sent to press during the year.

During portions of July and August Mr. Dinwiddie was engaged in the elabora-
tion of notes on a remarkable steatite quarry near Clifton, Va., and in the transfer
of the collections to the National Museum. The Clifton quarry is one of the largest
of the aboriginal excavations of soapstone thus far found in eastern United States,
and is noteworthy for the depth of the cutting and the large amount of fragmentary
and other material representing the processes of primitive quarrymen. Mr. Din-
widdie’s work on this material was interrupted when he joined the expedition into
the Papago country, and his report has not been completed.

Mr. Cosmos Mindeleff, who returned from the field about the end of September,
was occupied during the greater part of October in closing his accounts and in other
duties connected with the termination of long continued field operations. After-
wards he began the preparation of a report on his surveys and researches. During
November, December, and January the material was reduced to the form of a memoir
on the cliff ruins of Canyon de Chelly. In February a preliminary draft of the text
was brought to substantial completion, and the later portion of March was spent
chiefly in the preparation of illustrations. During March and April the text was
revised and rewritten, and toward the end of the latter month it was submitted for
publication. The preparation of the final drawings for the illustrations was also
substantially completed, and in June the memoir was assigned for publication in the
Sixteenth Annual Report of the Bureau.

Mr. Mindeleff’s surveys recorded in his report on Canyon de Chelly were both
extended and detailed, and have yielded a large body of especially trustworthy data
relating to this interesting portion of the continent. Ina large number of cases he
made diagrams showing the ground plans of structure, based on careful measure-
46 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

ments, and these plans were connected in plats which were in turn combined into
maps. Whenever practicable the plans were supplemented by drawings in elevation
and perspective, and by photographs; and the photographic and other illustrations
present vividly the characteristics of the region examined and the conditions under
which the ancient cliff dwellers lived, moved, worshiped their mysteries, defended
themselves against enemies, died, and were buried Many explorations have been
made in the Southwestern region, and many students have collected material relat-
ing to the peculiarly intelligent aborigines of this district; but none of the explora-
tions have been more thorough, none of the records more faithful, than that just
completed by Cosmos Mindeleff, and it is thought that his report will make Canyon
de Chelly classic ground for the archeologist.

Although conducted primarily for other purposes, the expedition directed by Mr.
McGee resulted in a number of interesting archzologic discoveries. Among these
may be mentioned: (1) ‘‘Las Trincheras,” a class of temporary fortifications about
isolated buttes or peaks near habitable valleys, forming a new archologic type for
this country; (2) a considerable number of prehistoric village sites, irrigation works,
etc., in a region heretofore supposed to be barren archeologically;.(3) extended
village sites, each dominated by one or more ceremonial or other ground structures,
sometimes accompanied by inclosures suggesting the domestication of animals; and
(4) great acequias, carried farther up the valley sides than the present irrigation
works, indicating more complete conquest of the waters during prehistoric times
than at present. The archeologic material collected during the expedition has not
been prepared for extended publication, but is withheld for further research in the
same region.

Although the collections in the National Museum made by members of the Bureau
in former years for the purpose of illustrating the life of the Pueblo tribes since the
Spanish advent is exceedingly rich, comparatively few objects representative of the
prehistoric arts of these interesting people have been collected. Opportunity having
at last been afforded for excavation among the remains of the ancient cliff-dwellings
and pueblo peoples of the Southwest, the Bureau was fortunate enough to enlist the
services of the late director of the Hemenway Expedition, Dr. J. Walter Fewkes,
the results of whose researches among the Hopi Indians of Tusayan, Ariz., are well
known. Dr. Fewkes proceeded, late in May, to the unfrequented locality known as
the Red Rock country, southwest of Flagstaff, Ariz., where he had the good fortune
to find a group of extensive cliff ruins hitherto unknown to archeologists and not
despoiled by white men. Excavation was prosecuted among these aboriginal remains
during June with considerable success, and a number of excellent photographs were
made. At the end of the month Dr. Fewkes returned to Flagstaff with a view of
reoutfitting for a thorough exploration of some of the extensive and presumably
rich ruins in the Tusayan country of northeastern part of the territory.

DESCRIPTIVE ETHNOLOGY.

Ever since the discovery of the American continent explorers have been impressed
by the characteristies of the aborigines, and many of them have recorded their obser-
vations and impressions in reports, letters, diaries, and treatises, and great numbers
of these records have been printed and published to the world. Inthis way a great
body of literature, sometimes styled Americana, has been produced. A great part
of this body of literature relates partly or wholly to the American Indians. Usually
the records were based on superficial observation and frequently they are vitiated
by misapprehension and hasty generalization. Nevertheless much of the literature
represents actual observation of the Indians while yet they retained primitive char-
acteristics. Thus, although the early records are diverse in value, the body of the
literature of this class contains a large store of information concerning the physical
characteristics, mental attributes, habits, customs, arts, beliefs, and institutions of
the native Americans, Moreover, research concerning primitive peoples has shown
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 47

that the ideas of the savage and barbarous peoples are expressed in the nomen-
clature much more fully and significantly than are those of cultured peoples, so that
the records of personal and geographic names are often of great utility as indices
to the intellectual characteristics, customs, and institutions of the Indian tribes;
information of this class abounds in America. Thus there is a large store of infor-
mation in the publications of the early and later travelers in America, but the liter-
ature is so vast and so widely scattered that the information is nearly inaccessi-
ble to students.

Even before the institution of the Bureau of American Ethnology, ethnologists
generally recognized the need of systematic information concerning the aboriginal
tribes, and several students had made essays toward the collection of such informa-
tion from the voluminous literature, either for personal use or for publication. When
the Bureau was organized, one of the lines of work projected was the compilation of
such information from the published hterature and from manuscripts, the compila-
tion being guided and corrected, and the material enriched by concurrent research
among the Indians themselves. The bibliographic work undertaken in the Bureau
and so long successfully carried forward by Mr. Pilling, was designed largely as a
meanstothisend. In addition, all of the collaborators of the Bureau were instructed,
and many correspondents were urged, to obtain and record general facts pertaining
to the tribes with which they came in contact; and most of the collaborators of the
Bureau have been employed from time to time in collating the material gathered in
this way. Anterior to the institution of the Bureau most of the students engaged
in systemizing the ethnologic data, arranged the material alphabetically on cards or
in books, generally under tribal and other proper names; this was the method pur-
sued by Dr. O. T. Mason, of the Smithsonian Institution, who was engaged in the
work before the institution of the Bureau; and essentially the same plan was pursued
by Mr. James Mooney during his earlier researches before he became connected with
the Bureau.

Under this method of assembling the data, it frequently happened that the rec-
ords were brief and incomplete and that the terms under which the entries were
made were variable, so that much care and thought were necessarily devoted to the
ascertainment of synonymy. As the work progressed with the Bureau the studies
continued, and the director and collaborators engaged in the compilation came to
speak of the work as a ‘‘Synonymy” of the Indian tribes. As the material con-
tinued to accumulate, and particularly as the more extended and more accurate
information gained by actual researches among the Indians was incorporated, it was
found that the synonymy proper diminished relatively, while the body of general
information became greatly expanded. Now that the records have so increased as
to fill several hundred thousand cards, it is found that the work forms a great cyclo-
pedia relating to the Indian tribes, which even in manuscript form is of large and
constantly increasing utility. With the development of a plan for publication, as
set forth in the last report, the inadequacy of the original name for the work came
to be appreciated, and during the present yearit has been decided to begin the issue
of the work in a series of bulletins corresponding with the aboriginal linguistic
stocks, under the designation ‘‘Cyclopedia of the American Indians.”

Throughout the fiscal year Mr. F. W. Hodge has had charge of the work on the
cyclopedia, and during most of the time he has been engaged in preparing the records
pertaining to several southwestern stocks for publication. Early in the year Mr. J.
Owen Worsey also contributed to the work, and during July, August, and Septem-
ber, Mr. James Mooney was occupied partly in extending the portion of the cyclo-
pedia relating to the Siouan .amily. Several bulletins are practically ready for the
press, and, save for conditions growing out of the modification of the law governing
the public printing, some of these would have been sent to the press before the close
of the year. :

In 1883 Mr. C. C. Royce was employed in the Bureau to collect and tabulate the
various treaties with the Indian tribes relating to the cession and transfer of lands.
48 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The work was substantially completed, and the lands affected by the various treaties
described in schedules and platted on maps. These schedules and maps were duly
turned in by Mr. Royce and were added to the archives of the office for use in con-
nection with the more strictly ethnologic researches. Since that date frequent
requests for information concerning the Indian land treaties have been received, and
thereby the value and accuracy of the work has been fully tested. During the year
the demand for such information so increased that it was decided to submit the
material for publication. While the schedules and maps were in most respects ready
for printing, revision of certain portions seemed to be required, and a general intro-
duction was thought to be desirable. sAccordingly in November the work of revision
was assigned to Dr. Cyrus Thomas, who also undertook the preparation of the
requisite introductory chapter. The remainder of the fiscal year was spent by Dr.
Thomas chiefly in the completion of this task, which was not quite done at the end
of that time. The work is designed for publication as Volume VIII of the Contri-
butions to North American Ethnology.

LINGUISTICS.

As the researches relating to primitive peoples in this and other countries pro-
gressed the importance of linguistic studies became more and more apparent. Man-
kind is preeminent partly because of a variety of individual characteristics, yet in
large measure because of social organization; and it is through organization that
men have been successively raised from savagery to barbarism, from barbarism to
civilization, and from simple civilization to the highest enlightenment and humanity,
Now, the basis of organization is expression, and the art of expression is accordingly
paramount among the arts of men, and ethnologists have found that the grade of
development and the classific relations of peoples are more justly indicated by their
arts of oral expression than in any other way. Thus the accepted ethnologic classi-
fication in this and other countries 1s primarily, if not wholly, linguistic.

The importance of linguistic researches has been recognized in the Bureau of
American Ethnology from the outset, and much labor has been expended in the col-
lection of linguistic literature as a basis for the classification of the tribes and also
as a means for still further extending the principles of ethnic classification.

During the last fiscal year this branch of the work has been carried forward con-
tinuously by Dr. Albert 8S. Gatschet and Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt, and during a part of
the year by the Director and Mr. J. Owen Dorsey.

The work of the Director in linguistics during the year was largely ancillary to
the researches in psychology and in anthropologic classification. In this connection
portions of the rich store of linguistic manuscripts were examined, and the princi-
ples of linguistic development were formulated for the use of the collaborators.

Mr. J. Owen Dorsey was occupied during July in (1) the preparation of a cata-
logue of the Teton-Dakota manuscripts by Messrs. Bushotter and Bruyier, in pos-
session of the Bureau, and (2) the continuation of his work on the Winnebago texts
and dictionary slips, noted in previous reports; and during August the first of
these lines of work was completed, and he then rearranged the linguistic manu-
scripts of the fireproof vaults of the Bureau. Many of these manuscripts are
unique. A large proportion represent the work of the regular collaborators of the
Bureau, but several have been derived from other sources by exchange or by dona-
tion, through the interest in the subject developed early in the history of the
Bureau. The material is of great scientific value, and it is deemed important that
it should be arranged in readily accessible form, in connection with a suitable cata-
logue. On completing this task, Mr. Dorsey resumed the preparation of material for
the synonymy of the Siouan stock, in connection with which he prepared during
November a brief memoir on Siouan sociology, which was afterwards revised by
Mr. McGee for incorporation in the sixteenth annual report of the Bureau. During
December Mr. Dorsey’s work was interrupted by illness, which, to the great loss of
science, terminated fatally.
;

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 49

At the beginning of the fiscal year Dr. Gatschet was engaged in elaborating the
large body of Shawano linguistic material described in preceding reports. This
work was continued until the end of September, and a large number of lexic and
erammatic elements were extracted and arranged on cards. In connection with this
work Dr. Gatschet prepared an ethnographic sketch of the Shawano for incorpora-
tion in the cyclopedia of Indian tribes and carried forward his comparative tabu-
lation of the phonetics, grammar, etymology, and syntaxes of all the Algonquian
dialects. Special attention was given to this comparative work throughout the
remaining portion of the year. During June particular attention was given to the
Peoria linguistics, which Dr. Gatschet has continued to elaborate in connection with
his comparative work on the Algonquian languages. The studies and comparisons of
this material indicate that it is in condition for publication so far as the vocabulary
is concerned, though further material will be required before the grammar can be
perfected. There is now in the Bureau archives a large body of carefully selected
material relating to the Algonquian languages, collected mainly through Dr.
Gatschet’s persevering industry. Considerable portions of the material are substan-
tially ready for publication; but it seems desirable, before sending the matter to
the press, to extend researches concerning certain of the dialects and to introduce
the whole by a discussion of the modes of development and the means of dialectic
differentiation. A part of the Director’s work during the year was contributed
toward such an introduction and discussion.

Mr. J. N. B. Hewitt was occupied during a part of the year in transcribing in
form for publication the Tubari vocabulary collected during the last fiscal year by
Dr. Carl Lumholtz, and in making comparative studies of this and other material
obtained by Dr. Lumholtz and other explorers and ethnologists in southwestern
United States and Mexico. The task of preparing the Tubari material for publica-
tion proved to be great, but was nearly completed during the fiscal year; when ready
for printing, the monograph will be an unique and invaluable record of a once
numerous tribe, now nearly extinct.

At intervals during the year Mr. Hewitt was engaged in a comparative study of
the pronoun as used by various Indian tribes. The pronoun is an important element
in primitive speech, and has received much attention from linguists and philologists
in many parts of the world. The archives of the Bureau now afford a more extended
basis for research concerning this element than is known to exist elsewhere, and this
material has been used efficiently and successfully by Mr. Hewitt in his researches.

Although the discussion of the subject was well advanced at the close of the fiscal
year, it was not yet in form for publication.

MYTHOLOGY.

Mrs. Matilda Coxe Stevenson, whose unfortunate state of health has somewhat
impeded the progress of her researches, continued the revision of notes and the final
writing of manuscript for her report on the Zuni Indians. This elaborate report has
been in preparation several months. In view of the great number and interest of
the ceremonials and the significant nature of the beliefs of the Zuni Indians, it is
thought desirable to spare no pains in making it as nearly exhaustive as possible,
and thus all details of ceremonial and belief are receiving attention, necessarily at
considerable expense in time.

Mr. Frank Hamilton Cushing, although not completely restored to health, has
been engaged in interesting researches concerning the significance of the arrow in
primitive thought, custom, and symbolism. Recent investigations of games of
divination, American and Oriental, by Mr. Stuart Culin (with whom Mr. Cushing
has in some measure cooperated) and by other students in this country and abroad,
have shown that among many primitive peoples games are conducted ceremonially
rather than for amusement, and that the games are commonly divinatory. The
researches have shown also that the arrow, either in itself or by symbol, is an essen-

SM 95 4

50 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

tial element in such divinatory games. One of the results of these researches is a
demonstration of the world-wide use of the arrow and of the existence of close
analogies, if not homologies, in fundamental symbolism among the primitive peoples
of several continents. The researches also indicate relative recency in origin of
many of the games played for amusement among civilized peoples; and they show
the origin and successive stages of development of many of these games with remark-
able clearness. In scieftific research each well-established conclusion gives a new
point of view from which the student is able to see further than before into the
unknown, and from which also he is able to see relations among the known more
clearly than before. This is strictly true of Mr. Cushing’s researches concerning the
arrow. His preliminary conclusions have afforded insight into various primitive
customs and ideas.
PSYCHOLOGY.

Throughout the fiscai year the attention of the Director has been given chiefly to
the development of a classification of thé races of mankind with special reference to
the American tribes. To this end the physical and mental attributes of the tribes
were considered in detail; and at the same time the art products were studied as
the tangible expression of mental attributes. Pursuing the investigation, it became
evident that the distinctive characteristics of individuals, tribes, and peoples, are
substantially intellectual. In this way the Director was led to an analysis of the
psychic characteristics of mankind. At first the subject was obscure and appar-
ently so complex as to discourage investigation; but as the work progressed, and as
arts, organizations, beliefs, and ceremonials, were interpreted as expressions of
psychic organization, the causes of apparently unrelated facts fell into order and
substantial progress was made in the researches. During recent months it has been
found that the researches concerning mental attributes of the American Indians
afford a clew to the differentiation of individuals and families, and the coalescence
of groups, and the development of individual and collective attributes. Thus the
researches in psychology have already yielded a basis for the classification of the
native tribes, and have illuminated the aboriginal arts, institutions and beliefs.

Considerable progress has been made in the preparation of an extended report
on the classification .of the native races and their attributes on a comprehensive
psychic basis; but the memoir remained unfinished at the end of the year.

BIBLIOGRAPHY.

Notwithstanding the serious condition of his health, Mr. James C. Pilling con-
tinued almost uninterruptedly the compilation of the bibliography of the languages
of the North American Indians. The early part of the year was devoted specially to
the preparation of the Shahaptian bibliography; but realizing the gradual failure
of his strength, Mr. Pilling decided to lay aside this work and to devote his energy
to the more important and extensive bibliography of the Mexican languages, and
in this labor he was engaged until toward the close of the year, when, his strength
having become completely exhausted, he was compelled to abandon it. This bibli-
ography, however, is left in such condition that it is believed the compilation may
be made ready for publication without great labor. With the possible exception
of the Algonquian bibliography, the bibliography of the Mexican languages will
be the most voluminous of the entire series, and many inquiries concerning and
applications for the volume have already been made by students. After a long and
faithful career in behalf of the Bureau of American Ethnology, the fruits of which
are known the world over, Mr. Pilling’s services terminated with the close of the
month of May.

PUBLICATIONS.

Satisfactory progress was made with the publications of the Bureau during the

nologist in charge, aided largely by Mr. F. W. Hodge and Mr. George M. Wood.
As stated in my report for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1894, the first proofs of
the thirteenth annual report were received from the Public Printer in June; by
the beginning of October the entire volume, with the exception of the administra-
tive report and the index, was in page form; the former has since been prepared
and transmitted, and the compilation of the index was well under way at the close of
the year.

On June 1 the manuscript of the text and illustrations for the fourteenth annual,
and on June 14 the copy for the fifteenth annual were transmitted to the printer,
but no proofs had been received at the close of the year.

Proof reading of the bulletin bearing the title Chinook Texts, by Franz Boas,
was continued from the last fiscal year (when 176 pages were in type), and carried
to completion by the middle of December. The edition of this bulletin was delivered
in May, 1895.

Final proof reading of the bulletin An Ancient Quarry in Indian Territory, by
W. H..Holmes, was also completed, and in October the brochure was ready for
distribution.

Early in August the manuscripts of three other bulletins were transmitted to the
Public Printer. One of these, the List of Publications of the Bureau of Ethnology,
by F. W. Hodge, was received shortly afterward, and in November the edition was
delivered. In September the first proofs of Archeologic Investigations in James
and Potomac Valleys, by Gerard Fowke, were received. By the close of the year
the proof reading was completed, and the edition was delivered by the Government
Printing Office in May, 1895. During the same period proof of the bulletin entitled
' Siouan Tribes of the East, by James Mooney, was read, and the edition received also
in May.

To summarize, the following publications were delivered by the Public Printer
and transmitted to the regular correspondents of the Bureau during the fiscal year:

Eleventh annual report, for 1889-90, containing, in addition to the Director’s
report of 25 pages, the following memoirs: (1) The Sia, by Matilda Coxe Stevenson.

MISCELLANEOUS.

Library.—The growth of the library, mainly through exchange with scientific

institutions and individuals: throughout the world, has been steady. T..1e number

_ of volumes in possession of the Bureau is 5,029, an increase of 679 volumes since the
last fiscal year. The accession of pamphlets and periodicals during the same period
has been proportionately great.

52 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

Illustrations.—The preparation of illustrations for the publications of the Bureau
of American Ethnology has been continued under the direct supervision of Mr.
De Lancey W. Gill, to whose artistic skill and intelligent interest in anthropologic
subjects the high standard of the pictorial part of the Bureau’s published works is
largely due.

Photographs.—In addition to the splendid series of photographs made by Mr. Din-
widdie, under the direction of Mr. McGee, during the season of exploration among
the Seri and Papago, and those made by Mr. Mindeleff at Canyon de Chelly, indi-
vidual and group photographs were made of an Osage and an Otoe delegation who
visited Washington in February and March, respectively.

NECROLOGY.

Garrick Mallery.—Col. Garrick Mallery, who-died at his home in Washington City,
October 24, 1894, was born in Wilkesbarre, Pa., April 23, 1831. After his graduation
at Yale College and a due course of study under the direction of his father, Judge
Garrick Mallery, he began the practice of law in Philadelphia, which he continued
until the outbreak of the civil war, when he entered the volunteer service as captain in
the Seventy-first Pennsylvania Infantry. Throughoutthe rebellion Mallery displayed
unusual bravery. In June, 1862, at the battle of Peach Orchard, Virginia, he was
twice severely wounded, and while lying on the battlefield was captured and sent
to Libby Prison, at Richmond, where he remained until exchanged and sent to his
home at Philadelphia. As soon as he had sufficiently recovered from his wounds
Mallery returned to duty and became lieutenant-colonel of the Thirteenth Pennsyl-
vania Cavalry, which position he retained until the close of the war. In 1866 he
was commissioned captain of the Forty-third Infantry of the Regular Army, and
later the brevet rank of colonel was bestowed on him for gallant and meritorious
services. His scientific knowledge was early recognized by the War Department,
and in 1870 he was detailed to execute a plan adopted by law for the prosecution of
meteorological researches by the Signal Service, and in this connection frequently
acted as chief signal officer of the Army.

Colonel Mallery’s studies of the ethnology of the Indians of North America began
with his military service’on the frontier. In 1876 he was assigned to the command
of Fort Rice, Dak., where he became absorbed in the sign language and pictography
of the plains tribes. His writings on these subjects soon became well and favorably
known, and on the organization of the Bureau of Ethnology in 1879 his services
were at once engaged by the director for the prosecution of the researches he had
so well begun. In 1880 his Introduction to the Study of Sign Language Among the
North American Indians as Illustrating the Gesture Speech of Mankind, was pub-
lished, followed immediately by A Collection of Gesture Signs and Signals of the
North American Indians, with Some Comparisons. The latter volume formed the
basis of his memoir on Pictographs of the North American Indians, a preliminary
paper of 256 pages published in the fourth annual report of the Bureau, and the.
greatly extended memoir of 807 pages and over 1,300 illustrations bearing the title
Picture Writing of the American Indians—a monument to his industry and ingenious
research—comprising the body of the tenth annual report of the Bureau. Colonel
Mallery’s Sign Language Among North American Indians Compared with that Among
other People and Deaf-Mutes, which appeared in the first annual report of the
Bureau, was based on his Collection of Gesture Signs and Signals, but even this
monograph of 290 pages and 300 illustrations was regarded only as preliminary, his
great work on this subject remaining unfinished at the time of his death.

Colonel Mallery was the first to direct serious attention to the investigation of the
population of the American aborigines in past times as compared to the present, and
his paper, The Former and Present Number of Our Indians, effectually exploded the
old theory that the aboriginal population of America at the time of the discovery
was much greater than at the present period. But Colonel Mallery’s anthropologic
researches were not confined to the American Indians. His studies in general soci-
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 53

ology show a wide and intimate acquaintance with the literature and peoples of both
continents, and his various writings exemplify his scholarly taste and strong power
of philosophic comparison. Among the papers pertaining to this subject prepared
by Colonel Mallery are: Manners and Meals, Greeting by Gesture, Customs of Cour-
tesy, Philosophy and Specialties, and The Gesture Speech of Man. His study,
“‘Tsraelite and Indian—a parallel in planes of culture,” provoked much discussion
among scientific men, and was translated into the German by Dr. Frederick S. Krauss.

In the words of a life-long friend, Garrick Mallery was ‘‘ the gallant soldier with
a stainless record; the scholar largely read in the literature of his own and other
times; the man of science who has left an imperishable record of ingenious and far-
reaching research; the trusted councilor in the societies which honored him with
their highest dignities; the genial companion; the affectionate husband; the staunch
friend; the high-bred gentleman.”

James Owen Dorsey.—In the death of Mr. Dorsey American ethnology lost a bril-
liant student. Born in Baltimore October 31, 1848, he acquired his primary education
in the schools of his native city. At anearly age he evinced a marked precocity in the
acquirement of language; it is said that at 6 he learned the Hebrew alphabet, and
ere he reached his eleventh year he could read the language with facility. At 14
young Dorsey entered the Central High School, now City College, and pursued the
classic course, but during his second year he was constrained to abandon his studies
by reason of ill health. In the autumn of 1867 he entered the preparatory depart-

_ ment of the Theological Seminary of Virginia, and the junior class in 1869. Two
years later he was ordained a deacon of the Protestant Episcopal Church, and in
May began mission work among the Ponka Indians of Dakota Territory. But the
rigorous climate and the vicissitudes of early frontier life soon affected his health,
which was never robust, and after serious attacks of illness in July, 1872, and early
in 1873, he was compelled to abandon his mission work in August of the latter year,
soon after he had acquired the ability to converse with the Indians without the aid
or an interpreter. Returning to Maryland he was engaged in parish work until
July, 1878.

While pursuing his work as missionary among the Indians, Mr. Dorsey became a
correspondent of the Smithsonian Institution. His profound knowledge of the dia-
lects of the Siouan languages early attracted the attention of Maj. J. W. Powell, at
whose instance he was sent among the Omaha tribe in 1878 for the purpose of
acquiring additional linguistic and other anthropologic material, remaining among
that people until the spring of 1880. In the meantime, upon the organization of
the Bureau of Ethnology, in 1879, he was immediately chosen one of the scientific
corps and was arduously engaged in linguistic and sociologic work up to the time of
the illness which terminated in his death in this city on February 4, 1895.

His great modesty and his strong conviction that the views of astudent should be
molded by truths prevented him from formulating subjective theories by which to
judge the value of his facts. In the later years of his studies in linguistic morphol-
ogy he began to feel the inadequacy of the venerable agglutination theory to explain
all the facts of word structure prevailing in the languages he was studying, and
he came to look upon adaptation—the infusing with a new meaning or function an
element which before had or had not any definite signification—as an important
and potent factor in the genesis and development of morphologic structures.
His mastery of the wealth of forms in the languages he studied enabled him to
illustrate copiously the working of this principle. His linguistic acumen and pains-
taking accuracy are brought out in his interlinear translations of numerous and
voluminous texts, both in print and in manuscript. His marvelous aptitude in
discriminating, grasping, and retaining sounds enabled him to obtain accurate
vocabularies and texts with great ease, and to detect differences of meaning and
function through differences of sound. His freedom from subjective theories, his
_ deep erudition, and enlightened conservatism made him one of the foremost
_ authorities in American linguistics.
54 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

In addition to numerous essays dealing with the linguistic ana other anthropologie
matters which appeared from time to time in various periodicals, Mr. Dorsey pub-
lished under the auspices of the Bureau of Ethnology the following excellent and
suggestive memoirs: Omaha Sociology, Osage Traditions, A Study of Siouan Cults,
Omaha Dwellings, Furniture, and Implements; Omaha and Ponka Letters, and The
Dhegiha Language, with Myths, Stories, and Letters. He also edited the Dakota-Eng-
lish Dictionary, and Dakota Grammar, Texts, and Ethnography of the late Rey.S. R.
Riggs, forming, respectively, Volumes VII and 1X of Contributions to North American
Ethnology. At the time of his death he had completed a paper on Siouan sociology.
Among the papers and articles of marked importance published in extra-govern-
mental mediamay be mentioned Migrations of Siouan Tribes, Comparative Phonology
of Four Siouan Languages, An Account of the War Customs of the Osages, and
Mourning and War Customs of the Kansas.

By reason of the purity and unselfishness of his motives, and the warmth and sun-
shine of his amiable nature, he won the esteem of all who had the pleasure of meet-
ing him, and, being ever kind, affable, and cheerful to his colleagues, ever willing to
aid and advise them, James Owen Dorsey was sincerely and cordially loyed and
revered by all.

Very respectfully, J. W. POWELL,
Director.
Mr. 8. P. LANGLEY,
Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.
APPENDIX III.

REPORT OF THE CURATOR OF EXCHANGES FOR THE YEAR ENDING
JUNE 30, 1895.

Sir: I have the honor to present the following report upon the operations of the
Bureau of International Exchanges for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895. It is
confined almost entirely to the presentation of statistics, compiled upon the plan
established in 1888.

The actual number of packages received during the year was somewhat over 9,000
(or 8 per cent) more than during the year preceding, the increase in the weight of
packages being nearly 92,000 pounds. This increase was due in part to the trans-
mission of a considerable number of packages which, on account of insufficient
appropriation, had to be declined during the preceding year, and more especially to
the transmission of the Congressional Library exchange, including a large number
of packages that had accumulated. Four hundred and fifty-nine more cases were
shipped abroad than during any previous year.

TABULAR STATEMENT OF THE WORK OF THE BUREAU.

The work of the Bureau is succinctly given in the annexed table, prepared in a
form adopted in preceding reports:

EXPENSES.

The expense of the exchange system is met in part by direct appropriation by Con-
gress to the Smithsonian Institution for the purpose, and in part by appropriations
made to different Government Departments or Bureaus, either in their contingent
funds or in specific terms for repayment to the Institution for a portion of the cost
of transportation.

In 1878 the Board of Regents established a charge of 5 cents per pound weight for
the publications sent out or received by the various Government Bureaus, this charge
being necessary to prevent an undue tax upon the resources of the Institution. For
similar reasons it has been found necessary to make a charge of like amount to State
institutions, from which a further small revenue has been derived.

The appropriation made by Congress to the Institution for the exchange service
for the fiscal year 1894-95 was in the following terms:

‘“‘Por expenses of the system of international exchanges between the United States
and foreign countries, under the direction of the Smithsonian Institution, includin
salaries or compensation of all necessary employees, seventeen thousand dollars.”

The receipts and disbursements by the accounting officer of the Smithsonian Insti-
tution on account of international exchanges, under date of July 1, 1895, covering
the fiscal year immediately preceding, were as follows:

The foregoing table shows that the entire amount received from Government
Bureaus and other sources was $5,660.88, which added to the appropriation of $17,000
makes the sum practically available for the specific purpose of exchanges $22,660.88,
while the expenses amounted to $21,090.61, the balance being held for repayment to
the Smithsonian Institution of the sum $944.36, which was advanced in the year
1893-94 to enable the Bureau to carry on its operations, and for other outstanding
liabilities. ;

CORRESPONDENTS.

As mentioned in previous reports, it became necessary in the latter part of 1891 to
provide for an addition to the series of “‘ledger” cards upon which were entered all
packages sent or received from a given society or individual. A plan was approved
by which the cards were much reduced in size, the bulk of the older cards having
already become a matter of serious consideration.

The new and smaller ledger cards were begun on January 1, 1892, and since that
date all the transactions have been entered uponthem. The abbreviation of the rec-
ords and their greater convenience in handling proved to be of the utmost service
when it became necessary to reduce the clerical force in the office, and it is only by
such abbreviation of the records and by the introduction of several minor labor-say-
ing devices that it has been at all possible to prevent the work from falling seriously
behind.

The number of ledger cards on June 30, 1894, was 20,223, and on June 30, 1895,
23,408. The difference of 3,185 represents the increase in the number of new societies
or individuals upon the exchange lists during the year making use of the service,
while the entire number of cards (23,408) is the number of societies and individuals,
both domestic and foreign, with which the exchange office has had relations since
January 1, 1892.

Attention has been directed for some time past to the fact that the list of corre-
spondents in the exchange office requires revision and recopying upon cards, the
original office list prepared and printed in 1886 having become so worn and so over-
crowded by frequent interlineations as to be almost illegible. This revision was
authorized by the Secretary in March, 1895, and the work was completed by Mr.
Boehmer before the expiration of the fiscal year.

The statistical statement of this work shows the existence of 23,408 names, of
which 10,765 are establishments and 12,643 individuals. They are located in 3,771
places, embracing all parts of the world from Disco, Greenland, in north latitude
70°, to Port Stanley, Falkland Islands, in latitude 50° south, and extending east and
west to 178° and 170°, respectively. A recapitulation of the work is given in the
following table:

The special exchange list for the distribution of Smithsonian documents is also in
need of revision and correction. It was prepared many years ago, and not a few of
the libraries to which it was deemed proper at the time to send these publications
have sunk into obscurity, while many new libraries have been established to which
it seems desirable that Smithsonian documents should be sent. A considerable
number of requests are received each year inviting an exchange of publications, or
requests for the completion of the Smithsonian series of documents, with which it
is rarely practicable to comply. This work has been begun, but had not been com-
pleted at the close of the year.

INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE OF OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS.

Under the treaty of Brussels of 1886, the text of which is given below,* the ez-
change of the official publications of the United States Government with other
countries has been continued by the Institution, and it now forms a very large
proportion of the Bureau’s work.

* CONVENTION CONCERNING THE INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGES FOR OFFICIAL DOCU-
MENTS AND SCIENTIFIC AND LITERARY PUBLICATIONS.

[Translation from the French. ]

The President of the United States of America, His Majesty the King of the Bel-
gians, His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, Her Majesty the Queen Regent of Spain,
His Majesty the King of Italy, His Majesty the King of Portugal and of the Algarves,
His Majesty the King of Servia, the Federal Council of the Swiss Confederation,
desiring to establish, on the basis adopted by the conference which met at Brussels
from the 10th to the 14th April, 1883, a system of international exchanges of the
official documents and of the scientific and literary publications of their respective
States, have appointed for their plenipotentiaries, to wit:

The President of the United States of America, Mr. Lambert Tree, minister resident
of the United States of America at Brussels; His Majesty the King of the Belgians,
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 61

The entire number of publications sent abroad during the year under the provisions
of the act of Congress of March 2, 1867, and of the treaty above referred to, was
23,028, and there have been received in return 974 packages. The United States
Government Departments have forwarded to their correspondents abroad 37,871
packages, and have received in return 14,813 packages. The total number of exchanges
for Government libraries has therefore been 15,787 packages received and 37,871
packages sent abroad, a total of 76,681 packages, or about 71 per cent of the entire
number handled.

The very inadequate return for the great number of documents sent out is in part
undoubtedly due to the fact that no other country publishes on such a lavish scale as
ourown. Direct solicitation made by a special representative to the Governments
with which the Institution is in correspondence would also probably result in a
considerable increase to the Library of Congress.

the Prince de Caraman, his minister of foreign affairs, and the Chevalier de Moreau,
his minister of agriculture, industry, and public works,

His Majesty the Emperor of Brazil, the Count de Villeneuve, his envoy extraordi-
nary and minister plenipotentiary near His Majesty the King of the Belgians,

Her Majesty the Queen Regent of Spain, Mr. de Tavira, chargé d’affaires ad
interim of Spain at Brussels,

His Majesty the King of Italy, the Marquis Maffei, his envoy extraordinary and
minister plenipotentiary near His Majesty the King of the Belgians,

His Majesty the King of Portugal and of the Algarves, the Baron de Sant’Anna,
envoy extraordinary and minister plenipotentiary of His Very Faithful Majesty,

His Majesty the King of Servia, Mr. Marinovitch, his envoy extraordinary and
minister plenipotentiary near His Majesty the King of the Belgians,

The Federal Council of the Swiss Confederation, Mr. Rivier, its special plenipo-
tentiary,

Who, after having communicated between themselves their full powers, which are
found in good and due form, have agreed upon the following articles:

ARTICLE I. There shall be established in each of the contracting States, a bureau
charged with the duty of the exchanges.

Art. II. The publications which the contracting States agree to exchange are the
following:

1st. The official documents, parliamentary and administrative, which are pub-
lished in the country of their origin.

2nd. The works executed by order and at the expense of the Government.

Art. III. Each bureau shall cause to be printed a list of the publications that it
is able to place at the disposal of the contracting States.

This list shall be corrected and completed each year and regularly addressed to
all the bureaus of exchange.

ArT. IY. The bureaus of exchange will arrange between themselves the number of
copies which they may be able eventually to demand and furnish.

ArT. V. The transmission shall be made directly from bureau to bureau. Uniform
models and formulas will be adopted for the memoranda of the contents of the cases,
as well as for all the administrative correspondence, requests, acknowledgments of
reception, etc.

Arr. VI. For exterior transmissions, each State assumes the expense of packing
and transportation to the place of destination. Nevertheless, when the transmissions
shall be made by sea, special arrangements will regulate the share of each State in
the expense of transportation.

Art. VII. The bureaus of exchange will serve, in an official capacity, as interme-
diaries between the learned bodies and literary and scientific societies, etc., * * *
of the contracting States for the reception and transmission of their publications.
It remains, however, well understood that, in such case, the duty of the bureaus
of exchange will be confined to the free transmission of the works exchanged, and

62 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

A large surplus of Government documents available for foreign exchanges has now
accumulated, the number of foreign Governments with which exchange relations
have been arranged not requiring at present the entire number received from the
printing office. The proper storage of these documents has now become a serious,
problem.

that these bureaus will not in any manner take the initiative to bring about the

establishment of such relations.
Art. VIII. These provisions apply only to the documents and works published

after the date of the present convention.

Art. IX. The States which have not taken part in the present convention are
admitted to adhere to it on their request.

This adhesion will be notified diplomatically to the Belgian Government, and by
that Government to all the other signatory States.

Art. X. The present convention will be ratified and the ratifications will be ex-
changed at Brussels as soon as practicable. It is concluded for ten years from the
day of the exchange of ratifications, and it will remain in foree beyond that time,
so long as one of the Governments shall not have declared six months in advance
that it renounces it.

In witness whereof the respective plenipotentiaries have signed it and have there-
unto affixed their seals.

Done at Brussels in eight copies the 15th of March, 1886.

EFFICIENCY OF THE SERVICE.

J venture to again call attention to the unsatisfactory condition of the exchange
relations with Greece, which are in the same state asa year ago, when, on account of
the expenses attending the distribution of packages, the transmission of miscellaneous
exchanges was discontinued by request of the librarian of the United National and
University libraries, formerly acting as the medium for distributing publications.

The exchange with Mexico is still also in an extremely unsatisfactory condition,
and the transmission of the parliamentary documents to the Mexican Government
has been suspended awaiting some action by the Mexican authorities, to whose
attention the matter was brought through the Mexican minister.

Iam glad to report that the comparatively large repayments made to the Smith-
Sonian Institution by Government bureaus for the transmission of their exchanges
have enabled the Bureau to employ some additional assistance, by which means it
has become possible to bring up to a great extent the records that during the past
year had fallen into arrears. It was also found practicable to make a slight increase
in the regular working force of the Bureau, and I take pleasure in bearing witness
* to the efficiency of the employees in the exchange office, and in expressing apprecia-

tion of their efforts to dispose of all the accumulations of the preceding year and to
keep up with the added volume of work, and I beg leave to call to your notice the
careful attention to the interests of the Institution on the part of its special agents
abroad, Dr. Felix Fliigel, in Leipsic, and Messrs. William Wesley & Son, in London.

Grateful acknowledgments are also due to the following transportation companies
and others for their liberality in granting the privilege of free freight or in other-
wise assisting in the transmission of exchange parcels and boxes, while to other
firms thanks are due for reduced rates of transportation in consideration of the dis-
interested services of the Institution in the diffusion of knowledge:

APPENDIX IY.

REPORT OF THE SUPERINTENDENT OF THE NATIONAL ZOOLOGICAL
PARK.

Sir: I have the honor to submit the following. report of the operations of the
National Zoological Park for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895.

The care of the collection of animals has engrossed most of the attention of the
employees. Such small additions to the buildings and inclosures as the funds at the
disposal of the park would allow have been made. Among these there may be
mentioned a new inclosure for beaver, which has been established in order to give
opportunity for the public to watch their building operations and to round a sepa-
rate colony, and because the beaver inclosure built last year was found insufficient
for the proper confinement of the animals.

It is evident that in order to maintain animals of this kind in security and safety,
more room and separate paddocks are necessary. At times they fight savagely with
each other, and when the inclosure is restricted even to half an acre of ground the
weaker one can not save himself by flight and is frequently killed. This has hap-
pened here.

Combats also take place among the buffalo and the elk, and if a herd of these
animals of any size is maintained it will be absolutely necessary to enlarge and
multiply the paddocks. Great need is felt for more buffalo cows.

Disorders due to confinement have not been absent. One interesting from a sci-
entific point of view was a spontaneous outbreak of rabies in one of the inclosures
for foxes, as these animals were apparently in perfect health and the disease could
not have been induced from without as far as is known. A single case at first
appeared and this inoculated the entire cage, seven animals in all being lost. This
- curious phenomenon is of great interest as bearing upon the sporadic appearance of
hydrophobia in the dog.

Careless feeding by visitors causes a great deal of trouble. Some animals habit-
ually overeat if allowed to do so, and the food which the public tender is often
unhealthful. <A fine cassowary died during the year from gastric irritation due to
this cause. A valuable Diana monkey was poisoned by laurel (Kalmia latifolia)
which she snatched from the hand of a visitor, though the utmost watchfulness is
exercised to keep this noxious plant from the animals.

Some very interesting additions to the collection have been made during the year.
From the Yellowstone Park 20 animals were received, among them a grizzly bear
weighing 730 pounds and of great ferocity, and 10 beaver. A beautiful sea lion was
obtained by exchange, as well asa fine boa constrictor. A fine young puma was
born, also a spotted lynx, several elk and Virginia deer, a zebu, and a llama.

The insufficient character of the buildings used for animals has been made appar-
ent en several occasions during the year. The ‘‘animal house” was constructed
with a view to the accommodation of the large carnivora and is not adapted for the
proper maintenance of monkeys, tropical birds, or pachyderms. Having no other
quarters, it has, however, been necessary to place under the same roof with lions and
tigers, that endure moderate cold well, other creatures that need a constant tempera-
ture of 75° to 80° F. and still others (such as the rhinoceros and hippopotamus) that
need still different conditions. The consequence of this is that more deaths occur than
would be the case were the buildings properly arranged, and it has not been possi-

68
REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 69

ble to prevent such accidents with the means at disposal. It is hoped that funds
may be soon forthcoming for the construction of separate houses for birds and for
pachyderms.

Considerable attention has been paid to the improvement of the grounds during
the year. Near the eastern entrance to the park a culvert has been built to accom-
modate the little stream that enters here and feeds the swan pond, the opening
being concealed by rockwork and shrubs so as to present the appearance of a natu-
ral spring. Below the bridge on the main road a large number of bowlders have
been placed in the creek to present the appearance of a natural ledge, thus raising
the water some 3 or 4 feet. This very greatly improves the stretch of water below
and above the bridge and permitted the introduction of aquatic and semiaquatic
plants along the edges of the stream. It has also the effect of raising the level of
the water in the large pond for aquatic animals situated to the southward of the
meadow. :

A rustic footbridge has been thrown over the ravine that enters the park at
Ontario avenue leading to the stairway by which the public pass to and from the
electric-car line. The wing walls of the main bridge have been completed by the
addition of rustic coping, which very much adds to the appearance of the structure.
The banks of the creek above the bridge are now strengthened and protected by
lining them with Joose riprap and planting them with willows and other quick-
growing shrubs.

The roads have also received considerable attention. The main drive to the north
of the animal house has been widened to 50 feet, and greatly improved by laying a
telford pavement. The main road has aiso been properly graded and improved
between the elephant house and the buffalo house, and about 1,000 feet of it treated
with macadam, making a suitable drive. Macadam has been laid onthe road behind
the elephant house and on the main drive from the eastern entrance to the bridge,
and the large ellipse in front of the bear dens has been completed by the addition
of finely pulverized stone.

The road leading into the park from Woodley road has been commenced, the work
under a preliminary appropriation of $2,500 being done by the District authorities
and the remainder by the park under an appropriation for $5,000. The funds on
hand have been sufficient only to make a 6 per cent grade from Woodley road down
to the banks of the creek. In order to make this road practicable it should be
treated with macadam and a sidewalk be provided.

The water supply has been extended so as to supply the office of the park and the
garden in which vegetables are raised for the animals, and additional drinking
fountains have been put in. An additional sewer has been constructed, by which
the toilet rooms, the elephant house, and the hippopotamus tank can discharge.

A temporary fence has been built around the pond for aquatic birds, and the
fences of the buffalo and elk paddocks have been strengthened. These fences,
although apparently of great strength, are found in practice to need constant
watching, as the powerful attacks of these animals cause them finally to give way.

Some small plantations of shrubbery have been made from time to time as the
funds at the disposal of the park would permit. These are principally in the vicinity
of the buffalo and elephant houses and in parts of the park where it seemed neces-
sary to seclude certain parts from the direct view of the public.

APPENDIX Y.

REPORT ON THE WORK OF THE ASTRO-PHYSICAL OBSERVATORY. FOR
THE YEAR ENDING JUNE 30, 1895.

During the past fiscal year the work of the Astro-physical Observatory has con.
tinued to be the investigation of the infra-red solar spectrum by the bolometri«
method, fully described in the report of the observatory for 1893.

This work consists, briefly, in the production of curves, automatically traced on a
photographic plate by means of the bolometer and its attendant apparatus, which
record by their deflections the existence, position, and intensity of (invisible) absorp-
tion lines in the infra-red spectrum from a prism of rock salt or from a grating.

Such a curve, ideally perfect, would show every line in the spectrum as a deflec-
tion of the curve in its proper place on the plate, and there would be no deflection
present not due to such a solar line. A curve which fulfills the first condition as
regards every considerable line, is in substance already at hand, and has been
shown even in a former stage of the work, and it is in fact easily obtained at
any time by the present method, so long as we confine our attention to the prin-
cipal newly discovered lines; lines or deflections, that is, which are due to solar
and telluric causes. (These may be called “true” lines as distinguished from the
smaller ‘‘false” lines due to minute local disturbance.) I say the principal lines,
because those first discovered result from deflections whose amount is relatively con-
siderable as compared with accidental local disturbances, and in this case the true
lines are distinguishabie (if only by their size and prominence) from the false ones,
the latter being due to many causes, which all, however, tend to produce more or less
minute deflections. This minuteness, then, fortunately, is one of the characteristics
of the false lines. Now, though these minor accidental deflections are negligible
compared with the more prominent real ones, yet as the work progresses and still
finer and finer details are sought, we must evidently at last reach a condition where,
having discovered all the larger true lines, we in seeking smaller and smailer ones,
finally come to such minute deflections that these, though constant, are reduced to
the same order of magnitude as the accidental or “‘ false” ones, however minute the
latter may be.

(In this connection it is proper to state that the plate of the spectrum showing very
minute detail, published in January of this year, had already been given in illustra-
tion of the process and printed in the Proceedings of the British Association for the
Advancement of Science, for August, 1894, accompanied by the statement that it was
presented ‘‘only in illustration,” and was ‘‘not to be treated as a criterion of the
final results,” and that the statement that ali these lines had then been verified
escaped attention. )

It is again fortunate, that our criterion is not that of size alone, but that in order
to distinguish between true deflections, however minute (due to solar and telluric
causes), and minute ‘‘false” deflections of the same order of size due to accidental
disturbances, an independent, simple, and infallible criterion exists—infallible, that
is, in theory, but not always easy in practical application.

15
76 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

This criterion has been elsewhere mentioned, and indeed is sufficiently obvious to
need little explanation; for if among a large number of curves representing the same
spectral region a deflection asserts itself constantly at the same place, that deflec-
tion is evidently due to a constant cause and not to an accidental one. Now, from
the nature of the process, it is hardly possible to imagine any efficient constaat
cause of such minute abrupt deflections as are in question, which is not a solar or
telluric cause, and it is these only we seek. Again, it will be seen that, provided
the deflections are of a finite order of minuteness, and that our mechanism can record
with such precision that the true or solar line falls at absolutely the same place on
each of even two plates, the chances are infinite against any exact coincidence of
lines which are not ‘‘true.” In practice, where absolute accuracy is unattainable,
we mast determine experimentally between what limits error customarily presents
itself, in the case of the true lines and in that of the false, and then ascertain what
probable error attaches to the result from the final comparison of any number.

During the preceding year certain main deflections, somewhat less than one
hundred in number, were so established as ‘‘true;” but when within the past year
the work reached a state of progress warranting the more detailed investigation
of the spectrum alluded to, upon applying the criterion mentioned above to the
deflections representing the minute lines with which the work was now dealing, it
became evident that the number of very small casual deflections made it desirable
to subject the method of making the curves to a renewed examination, in which
the source of each class of minute error should be as far as possible discriminated.
This examination hasshown that the site which the observatory occupies is exposed
to local tremors and magnetic disturbances in’a still greater degree than had been
anticipated. The appended table gives a rough classification of the sources of these

errors.

teries.

From what has been said it will be seen that in order that the agreement
of anumber of separate curves might furnish conclusive evidence of the reality of
a line, it became necessary to establish experimentally the amount of accidental
deflection due to local tremor wholly, and also the admissible amount of final error
inherent in the mechanical, optical, and photographic processes employed. The
following degree of accuracy has been judged possible as a final attainment with
the present means, and is that aimed at, although not yet reached. This aim is to
produce curves which, in a length of 60 centimeters, shall be free from any probable
error of a magnitude greater than one-tenth of a millimeter—a quantity whose
minuteness relative to the means employed may be understood when it is mentioned
that it corresponds to six-tenths of a second of arc, as measured on the circle of the
spectrometer.

For the above reasons it will be seen that the improvement of theapparatus used,
as well as the investigation of sources of possible error, became the most important
work of the observatory before the publication of authoritative results.

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. ri

Iam pleased to state that by the use of the improved apparatus, to which I refer
later, the amount of the probable error has been greatly reduced, and the investiga-
tion of the causes of false deflections has justified the belief that those not directly
due to the site of the observatory will be, ere long, eliminated.

During the progress of this work the making of observations with the apparatus
on hand has not been suspended, but, on the contrary, has produced a larger num-
ber of bolographs than during any preceding year. The work in detail may most
conveniently be classified under three general heads:

A. General spectro-bolographic work.
B. Special spectro-bolographic work.
C. Improvements in apparatus and methods.

A. The subjoined table shows in detail the number of working days and the num-
ber of bolographs made in the observatory during the year.

On the 5th of December, 1894, an extended experimental investigation of the
errors exhibited by the apparatus and the methods in use was begun on a scale not
before tried, and the effects from variations in the potentials of the batteries and
from temperature effects in the complicated circuit of the bolometer, as well as
from the tremors of the earth and changes of the magnetic field, incident to the bad
location of the observatory, were found to be larger than had been assumed from
previous trial. Since that time the reduction of these errors has been the constant
effort of the observatory.

The entire circuit of the bolometer has been overhauled and made to consist, as
nearly as possible, of copper of the same density and without joints which might
produce thermal effects.

The experimental bolographs, referred to in the above table, were, for the most
part, devoted to the investigation of the error produced by minute variations in the
potentials of the batteries used in the bolometer circuit. In order to give some idea
of the delicacy of the performance required of this apparatus, it may be added that
the variations averaged only 0.0000007 of a volt, but were still considered to be too
large for accurate working. It has also become evident that the arrangement of
balancing coils, which have up to the present time been of the usual laboratory
type, were capable of producing, under the fluctuations of temperature in tho
observatory, effects of the magnitude of those produced by the minute solar lines,
which it was now being attempted to define and measure.
78 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The greater number of working days have been devoted to the production of a
large number of bolographs of the upper infra-red spectrum made under widely
varying conditions for the purpose of studying the possible causes of the errors
which have been roughly indicated above. To this end an investigation of the per-
sonalities of different observers, as they may affect the final results of each observa-
tion, has also been undertaken.

B. The classification, detailed examination, and final reduction of bolographs to
the linear translations, or ‘‘ cylindrics,” which resemble in appearance photographs
of the visible spectrum, has kept pace with the production of the most satisfactory
curves.

The production of these linear spectra involves the services of a photographer
during three to five days in each instance, and extreme accuracy; for this reason,
only the best of the curves obtained are subjected to this process. The table given
below includes only those plates which are free from defects, and consequently rep-
resents but a small part of the labor involved in the production of results which

may seem intrinsically small:

C. The development of the instruments used, to as near mechanical perfection as
it is possible to obtain with the means at command and under the conditions pre-
vailing in the observatory, has constituted, for the reasons given above, a very
large part of the work up to the present time.

The siderostat has been furnished with a new counterpoise for the altazimuth
mirror support, a new direction axis and base for the mirror, and a new polar axis,
resting upon ball bearings, completed December 1, 1894. This massive instrument,
which has been greatly modified since it left the maker’s hands until it has taken
the form shown in the annexed illustration, is now capable of being brought to
exact adjustment, and needs only the addition of a new governor for its driving
clock to make it most efficient.

With the hope of compensating in some degree for the extreme variations of tem-
perature due to the construction of the present building, a conduit for warm air in
winter and cold air in summer from the blowers in the Smithsonian building was
constructed. The coils of piping for bringing the admitted air to the proper tem-
perature after it has reached the observatory are not yet complete, and the need of
‘YSLSWO108-OYLOSdS JHL JO YOOND ONIAIYG SHL

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY. 19

a more perfect automatic regulation of the temperature (in the interest of the work
-rather than of the comfort of the observer) is being provided for.

During the year 1893 the galvanometer, perhaps the most important part of the train
of apparatus, was brought to such a condition that no further improvement in this
direction was regarded as necessary until justified by a more permanent building
and better facilities for isolation from magnetic and seismic disturbances than are
at present capable of being obtained, but in order to make the best use of the facili-
ties at hand, the former unstable galvanometer pier has been replaced by a massive
brick and stone structure, finished March 23, 1895, built in such a manner that pro-
tection from the vibrations of the surface earth is insured. It is, however, proper
to repeat that the vibrations of the earth, as well as the seismic disturbances, conse-
quent to the location of the observatory amid the traffic of the city, continue to pre-
sent serious causes of error which no possible care or pains seems able to prevent.

By examinations conducted in October, 1894, it was shown that the driving clock
of the spectro-bolometer train performed its part with less than the rigorous accuracy
required. It has consequently been replaced by a much more accurate mechanism,
of which an illustration is given, installed April 2, 1895, which was constructed by
Messrs. Warner & Swasey, of Cleveland, in part, and in part by Mr. John A. Brashear,
of Allegheny. This clock which controls both the movement of the photographic
plate and of the great azimuth circle carrying the prism, has been shown, under the
strain of repeated use, to perform its duty within the limit of allowed probable
error—that is, one-tenth of a millimeter in 60 centimeters motion of the plate, or six-
tenths of a second of arc in one degree at the circle. A new pier has also been
constructed for the support of this clock.

A mean solar standard clock, by the Howard Watch and Clock Company, has been
placed in the basement of the Smithsonian Institution.

Great difficulty has always been experienced in the proper protection and preser-
vatron of the optical surfaces of the rock salt necessarily employed. <A large gain
in time and economy has been made by introducing the practice of repolishing the
surfaces in the observatory itself, and it is now possible to refigure the surface of a
large prism or lens in a few hours, at a small cost, where it was formerly the custom
to send such a prism or lens to distant opticians at a considerable expense of time
and money.

A new bolometer case, with provision for receiving radiations from two sources,
and many minor pieces of apparatus, have been constructed in the workshop of the
observatory. These improvements in the apparatus have been accompanied by
improvements in the method of their use, which will more fittingly form the subject
of future report, but they may nearly all be connected with the need of a more con-
stant temperature, combined with freedom from ground and magnetic tremors.

MINOR WORK OF THE YEAR.

Some further experimental data were collected for the more accurate determina-
tion of the laws governing the change of the index of refraction of rock salt, with
changes in its temperature. The approach of observing weather prevented the com-
pletion of the experiments.

All of the bolometers on hand have been calibrated, in order that their relative
efficiencies, as well as the means of reading their indications quantitatively, might
be known.

The very minute and rapid changes in the potential of certain types of storage
batteries, intended for the use with the bolometer, have been measured, and their
effect upon the indications of the bolometer investigated.

It should finally be repeated, as the most important conclusion of the year, that
the final degree of precision attainable can never be reached in the present site.

PERSONNEL.

Mr, C. G. Abbot was appointed as assistant in the observatory on the 19th of June,
1895.

REPORT OF THE LIBRARIAN.

Srr: I have the honor to present herewith a report upon the operations of the
library of the Smithsonian Institution during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1895.

The entry numbers of accessions to the Smithsonian deposit at the Library of
Congress extend from 292,426 to 314,499.

The following table gives an analysis in volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets,
and charts of the accessions during the year:

|

In addition to this there have been added to the Secretary’s library, office library,
and the library of the Astrophysical Observatory 321 volumes and pamphlets and
1,995 parts of volumes, making a total of 2,316, and a grand total of accessions for
the year of 31,953 volumes, parts of volumes, pamphlets, and charts.

Of these accessions, 133 volumes, 7,451 parts of volumes, and 619 pamphlets were
retained for the use of the United States National Museum, and 1,176 medical disser-
tations were deposited in the library of the Surgeon-General, United States Army;
the remaining publications were sent to the Library of Congress on the Monday
after their receipt.

In carrying out the plan formulated by the Secretary in 1887 for increasing the
library exchanges, 473 letters were written asking for publications not on the list, or
for numbers to complete the series already in the library. Iam enabled to report
that 182 new exchanges have been thereby secured, and that 97 defective series
were either completed or added to, as far as the publishers were able to supply the
missing parts.

A separate record of periodicals received is kept, and from this it appears that the
library is now currently receiving 3,045 periodicals, magazines, and publications of
learned societies. This number does not, however, include all such publications
arriving at the Institution, inasmuch as many societies whose publications-are issued
irregularly had not been included in the periodical record up to within recent times.
A detailed statement of the language and frequency of issue of these publications is
herewith given, roughly divided into pure science, of which there are 1,565, applied
science 704, and miscellaneous 776.

82 REPORT OF THE SECRETARY.

The following universities have sent complete sets of their academic publications,
including inaugural dissertations:

Basel, Greifswald, Leipzig,
Berlin, Halle-Wurtem, Louvain,
Bern, Heidelburg, Lund,
Bonn, Helsingfors, Marburg,
Breslau, Jena, Tubingen,
Erlangen, Johns Hopkins, Utretcht,
Freiburg, Kiel, Wiirzburg,
Giessen, Konigsberg, Zurich.

Of late a considerable number of American universities have begun to publisn
dissertations accepted for the degree of doctor of philosophy, and correspondence is
now in progress for the purpose of securing full sets of these for the Library.

For some time the question of providing reading matter for the employees of the
Institution has been under consideration. During the year the Secretary authorized
the purchase and binding of sets of a number of the more important literary maga-
zines. These magazines, which are freely used, are also of much value in a scientific
library, as they often contain early reports of explorations, new discoveries, and
inventions.

Through a course of changes in the Smithsonian Building, much needed improve-
ments in the ventilation and lighting of the reading room and library offices were
rendered possible.

The list of donors to the library has become so large that it is impossible to specify
them. Attention, however, must be directed to a magnificent gift of His Imperial
Majesty the Sultan of Turkey of more than fifty volumes of photographs represent-
ing the present condition of the Ottoman Empire in all departments of industry,
learning, and art. The Institution has also acquired the library of the late Robert
Stanton Avery by bequest.

In addition to the reading room, which contains the current periodicals and trans-
actions of learned societies, a room is provided for works of reference, and sectional
libraries relating to astronomy and aerodromics are maintained. A collection of
books and catalogues containing addresses is deposited in the office of the Bureau of
International Exchanges.

The library has now set apart five communicating rooms on the north side of the
first floor, as well as a room on the second floor of the building, for prints. In addi-
tion to these, the various sectional libraries above referred to are kept in the differ-
ent office rooms. The space assigned is more than double that allowed in past years,
and the facilities thus accorded are much appreciated by the staff of the Institution
and of the various scientific bureaus of the Government in Washington. _

By your direction I spent the months of August and September, 1894, in England
and on the Continent of Europe, in examining into the exchange service. I also
visited a numberof libraries and booksellers and secured information concerning the
indexing of scientific literature. A detailed report upon these subjects has already
been presented to you.

Respectfully submitted.

Cyrus ADLER, Librarian.
Mr. 8. P. LANGLEY,

Secretary of the Smithsonian Institution.

GENERAL APPENDIX

TO THE

SMITHSONTAN REPORT FOR 1895.

ADVERTISEMENT.

The object of the GENERAL APPENDIX to the Annual Report of the
Smithsonian Institution is to furnish brief accounts of scientific discov-
ery in particular directions; reports of investigations made by collab-
orators of the Institution; and memoirs of a general character or on
special topics that are of interest or value to the numerous correspond-
ents of the Institution.

It has been a prominent object of the Board of Regents of the Smith-
sonian Institution, from a very early date, to enrich the annual report
required of them by law with memoirs illustrating the more remarka-
ble and important developments in physical and biological discovery,
as well as showing the general character of the operations of the Insti-
tution; and this purpose has, during the greater part of its history,
been carried out largely by the publication of such papers as would
possess an interest to all attracted by scientific progress.

In 1880 the Secretary, induced in part by the discontinuance of an
annual summary of progress which for thirty years previous had been
issued by well-known private publishing firms, had prepared by com-
petent collaborators a series of abstracts, showing concisely the prom-
inent features of recent scientific progress in astronomy, geology,
meteorology, physics, chemistry, mineralogy, botany, zoology, and
anthropology. This latter plan was continued, though not altogether
satisfactorily, down to and including the year 1888.

In the report for 1889 a return was made to the earlier method of
presenting a miscellaneous selection of papers (some of them original)
embracing a considerable range of scientific investigation and discus-
sion, This method has been continued in the present report, for 1895.

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.!

By PRoF. ARTHUR SCHUSTER, F. B.S.

It is hardly possible to imagine that the first experimenter who
obtained an electric spark sufficiently strong to produce a sensible
sound should not at once have been struck by the fact that he was in
the presence of thunder and lightning on a small scale. We find,
indeed, in various writings from the early days of electrical machines a
number of suggestions that the thunderstorm is an electrical phenom-
enon; but to Benjamin Franklin belongs the merit of having perceived
that a direct experiment was needed to prove what so far was only a
guess. In an article entitled ‘Opinions and conjectures concerning
the properties and effects of the electrical matter arising from experi-
ments and observations made at Philadelphia, 1749,” the following
passage occurs:

“To determine the question whether the clouds that contain light-
ning are electrified or not, | would propose an experiment to be tried
where it can be done conveniently. On the top of some high tower or
steeple place a kind of sentry-box, big enough to contain a man and
an electrical stand. From the middle of the stand let an iron rod rise
and pass, bending out of the door, and then upright 20 feet or 30 feet,
pointed very sharp at the end. If the electrical stand be kept clean
and dry, a man standing on it, when such clouds are passing low,
might be electrified and afford sparks, the rod drawing fire to him from
a cloud.

“If any danger to the man should be apprehended (though I think
there would be none), let him stand on the floor of his box, and now
and then bring near to the rod the loop of a wire that has one end
fastened to the leads, he holding it by a wax handle, so the sparks, if
the rod is electrified, will strike from the rod to the wire and not affect
urna.” ?

The experiment suggested by Franklin was successfully performed
in Marly (France), by D’Alibard, on May 10, 1752,° in London by Can-
ton, in Spital square, on July 20, 1752, and by Wilson, in Chelmsford,

Essex, on August 12 of the same year. Franklin himself describes
having used a kite in Philadelphia in a letter dated October 19, with-
out giving the date of his observations. But this must be supplied in
some passage which I have not been able to find, for Rosenberger
(‘“Geschichte der Physik,” Vol. IL, p. 316) mentions that it was done in
June.

Franklin’s disbelief in the dangerous character of the experiment
must have received a severe shock when he heard of the death of
G. W. Richmann, who, in the year 1753, was killed by an electric dis-
charge drawn from the clouds by means of a kite.

The thunderstorm is the most impressive effect of atmospheric elec-
tricity, though it is rivaled in beauty by the aurora, and in interest by
the many phenomena of daily occurrence which are only made percepti-
ble to us by proper instruments. In a lecture delivered before this
institution on May 18, 1860, Lord Kelvin described the delicate elec-
trical appliances constructed by him for the more accurate observation
of atmospheric electricity. The problems then for the first time clearly
stated gave a powerful and still lasting impulse to the investigation of
atmospheric electricity, and though no decisive answer can be given
to all the questions raised in that lecture, recent researches have.
brought us somewhat nearer to their solution.

Observations which may be made every day and at every place have
Shown that the earth is electrified, whatever the weather may be. In
the language of the older theories, which we can not as yet altogether
abandon, we say that the earth is covered with negative electricity, or,
in modern phraseology, we express the same idea by the statement
that we move about in an electrified field, that electric lines of force
stretch through the air from the ground, from our bodies, and from
everything which is exposed to the sky overhead. The strength of this
electric field is not at all insignificant. If we wish to produce it arti-
ficially between two parallel plates kept at a distance of 1 foot, we
-snould have to apply an electromotive force sufficient—and sometimes
more than sufficient—to light up the incandescent lamps which illu-
minate our dwellings. The electric force is comparatively weak in our
country, but 50 volts per foot are constantly observed, and 100 volts
are not uncommon; but in drier climates the amount of the force may
be considerably in excess of these figures.

Tf we fix our minds on the lines of force starting from the surface of
the earth, we are at once led to ask, Where is their other end? Do
they curve round and back again to earth? Do they end in the dust
which everywhere surrounds us, or do they reach up to the clouds?
Do they pass through the clouds and end where invisible particles
separate the sunset red from the midday blue? Or, finally, do they
leave the earth altogether, and form intangible bonds between us and
the sun, the stars, the infinity of space? These are not idle questions,
and we can not be said to have solved our problem unless some definite
ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 93

answer is given to them. The last mentioned view, propounded origi-
nally by Peltier, and latterly supported by Exner, is the simplest. If
we could allow that the earth, once electrified negatively, could remain
electrified forever, the corresponding positive electrification being
outside our atmosphere altogether, the chief difficulty of atmospheric
electricity would be removed, aud the normal fall of potential at the
surface would be explained by the permanent negative electrification
of the surface.

Unfortunately this view, to be tenable, has to assume that the
atmosphere is a complete nonconductor to the normal electric stress,
and this is known not to be the case. We know of several causes
which break down the insulating properties of air. If two pith balls
are electrified and repel each other, and a match be lit in their neighbor-
hood, the pith balls come together, showing that they have lost their
charge, and consequently that the flame of the match has destroyed
the insulating power of air. It is not only the flame itself which con-
ducts, but also the gases rising from the flame.’ The following experi-
ment will prove this. In Fig. 1, Plate I, A represents a metallic tube
bent round at the upper end, and containing at its lower end a Bunsen
burner in metallic contact with the tube, which is also connected to an
electroscope. The tripod T, which supports the tube, is insulated by
blocks of paraffin. A Leyden jar L, on a separate support, is placed
so that the knob stands at about the level of the upper part of the
tube, which acts as chimney to the flame. The knob of the jar may be
a few inches away from the opening of the chimney, and not neces-
sarily in a line with it. The experiment succeeds, although the gases
rising from the burner may not come into contact with any part of the
jar. The jar is charged, and care must be taken that no fibers of dust
attach themselves either to the jar or chimney. I have found it con-
venient to join a piece of amalgamated zine to the end of the chimney.
Under these circumstances the charge of the jar will be found to leak
across to the tube, and the leaves of it will diverge. If, as in Exner’s
form of electroscope, the leaves, on reaching a certain divergence, dis-
charge by forming a contact with earth-connected plates C C’, the
charging and discharging can be watched for a long time. It will be
noticed that the flame, being altogether surrounded by a tube of the
same potential, cannot be active in this case, but the conductivity must
be due to the gas as it escapes from the chimney.

It follows from these experiments that every fire burnt on the surface
of the earth and every chimney through which products of combustion
pass act like very effective lightning couductors, and would conse-
quently discharge, slowly but surely, any electrification of the surface
of the earth. The peculiar immunity of factory chimneys against dam-
age by lightning appears from statistics collected by Hellmann in

1 The most complete investigation of the conduction of gases rising from flames
is contained in-a series of papers by Giese (Wiedemann’s Annalen, Vol. XVII).

Schleswig-Holstein,' for while 6.3 churches per thousand were struck,
and 8.5 windmills, the number per thousand of factory chimneys was
only 0.3.

Franklin was acquainted with the action of flames. He also discoy-
ered that no charge can be given to a red-hot iron ball, a fact which
seems to have been forgotten until rediscovered in our own times by
Guthrie. Franklin also tried the action of sunlight, but obtained no
result. Had he performed the experiment with carefully-cleaned zine,
he would have anticipated one of the most striking of Hertz’s discov-
eries. We now know that a negatively-charged surface will discharge
into air when illuminated by strong violet light, and sunlight will be
sufficient with specially sensitive materials. This action has been
investigated in detail by Elster and Geitel, who have not, however,
succeeded in obtaining results with sunlight acting on such bodies as
we know the earth’s crust to be made of. So far, then, we have no
experimental evidence to include light as an active agent in the phe-
nomenon of atmospheric electricity.

We possess in the electric discharge itself a very powerful and prob-
ably very generally active means of breaking down the insulating power
of air. Some of the experiments (Proc. Roy. Soe., Vol. XLII) which
I described some years ago to prove this were objected to on the ground
that it might not be the discharge itself, but the ultra-violet light sent
out by the luminosity of the discharge, which was active. The follow-
ing form of the experiment conclusively shows that the discharge acts
independently of light.

In Fig. 2, Plate I, R represents a Rhumkorff coil entirely surrounded
by a metallic box B, which is connected toearth. The terminals of the
coil lead to two electrodes inside a metallic tube T, which is also kept
at zero potential. This tube is arranged so that a current of air can
be blown through it. The air, on escaping through the tube, is made
either to impinge on or to pass near a metallic plate connected to a
charged electroscope. Under these circumstances the electroscope is
not discharged either by a current of air alone or by the coil alone;
but as soon as the air is blown through the apparatus while the sparks
are passing and then made to impinge on the plate C, the electroscope
is instantaneously discharged. ‘The experiment succeeds when a plug
of cotton-wool is inserted at W to stop the action of the dust; but a
plug of cotton-wool at the other end diminishes the action so much that
J am doubtful whether the effect then really exists there. I am, so far,
not inclined to believe that the action is due to dust, but rather that
the cotton-wool acts in increasing very considerably the interval which
elapses between the time at which the spark acts and the time at which
the sparked air passes out of the tube. The effect may be observed

even though the tube L is lengthened by an addition of another piece
3 feet or 4 feet long.

Several phenomena, one of which had been known for a long time,
can be explained by the fact. that the electric discharge changes the
condition of the gas into a state similar to that of gases rising from
flames. It is mentioned, for instance, by Faraday that electric sparks
are liable to succeed each other along the same path, and it is known that
the same holds for lightning flashes, facts which themselves point to a
higher conductivity of air along the path of the previous discharge. A
curious instance of a similar effect is afforded by lightning conductors,
which are sometimes put up to protect overhead leads used for con-
veying a high tension current. Owing to the obvious impossibility
of connecting the leads directly to earth, a small air gap is inter-
posed, the idea being that the air gap will act as an insulator for the
current the leads are intended to carry, but that if during a thunder-
storm the potential rises sufficiently high to be dangerous, equalization
may take place through the air gap to earth by means of a small spark.
So far the air gap answers its purpose, but as soon as a spark passes
through the gap it destroys the insulating power of the air, and the
main current consequently takes a short cut through the gap. At
Pontresina, in the Engadine, lightning conductors put up in this way
are so sensitive that a flash of lightning several miles away causes a
small spark by induction, and instantaneously puts out every electric
lamp in the town.

If we accept the view that an electric discharge destroys the insulat-
ing power of the gas, it follows that the outer regions of the atmosphere
must conduct, for we have ample reason to suppose that electric cur-
rents are passing continuously through those regions. The aurora
borealis in the arctic regions is, according to Nordenskiéld’s observa-
tions, a permanent phenomenon, and the diurnal changes of terrestrial
magnetism show that in our latitudes electric currents traverse the air
above us. However small a conductivity we may assign to the atmos-
phere, the earth could not remain electrified inside such a shell of par-
tially conducting gases. Lord Kelvin drew the same conclusion in the
Royal Institution lecture, on the assumption that gases at much reduced
pressures cease to insulate. We may leave it an open question whether
the normal electric stress could in itself cause a discharge in the outer
regions; but we can not deny that under existing conditions these
regions do not insulate, and Lord Kelvin’s argument still holds good.

But the question of the ending of the lines of force—in other words,
the location of the positive charge corresponding to the negative elec-
trification of the surface of the earth—can only be solved by balloon
or kite experiment, and we may briefly mention the more important
results which have so far been obtained.

Observations made up to heights of about 1,000 feet seem to indicate
a strengthening of the electric field, i. e., the fall of potential per meter
96 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.

is greater at a height of, say, 200 meters than on the surface of the
earth. The observations of Dr. Leonhard Weber (Elektrotechnische
Zeitschrift, April, 1888) bring out this point clearly. In one ease the
fall of potential at a height of 350 meters was found to be six times
that at the earth’s level. This increase is in itself not surprising, if
we remember that every particle of dust raised from the ground must
itself be negatively electrified, and probably the observed increase in
the electric force is sufficiently accounted for by the presence of elec-
trified dust.

Observations made at greater heights in balloons, on the other hand,
seem clearly to indicate that this increase soon ceases, and that a
diminution already takes place at moderate heights. Thus the obser-
vations of Dr. O. Baschin (Meteorologische Zeitschrift, September,
1894) gave for the fall of potential in volts per meter the numbers 49,
28,13 at heights of 760, 2,400, 2,800 meters respectively, and at a Reietn
of 3, 000 meters no mnenstma bls fall at all could be obtained. These
Been ations were made in clear weather. The balloon afterwards
passed over a layer of clouds, and strong electric effects were noticed.
Similar observations had been previously made by others (Andrée, Le
Cadet, and Bornstein), and though the subject is by no means exhausted,
we may take it as provisionally established that the lines of force of the
normal electric field of the earth end within the first 10,000 feet or
15,000 feet. This result is of great importance, for it shows that in fine
weather there must be a layer of positively electrified air permanently
above us. Currents of air in this layer must affect the field as we
observe it, and possibly the daily period may be due to changes in the
currents of air at a moderate height. A fact discovered by Exner is of
importance in connection with this subject. Observing at three differ-
ent places (in a field close to Vienna; in St. Gilgen, on the Wolfgangsee,
and on the hills near Venice), he found that whenever there was a
strong south wind, with aclear sky, the normal electric force was always
increased, and sometimes considerably (Wiener Akad. Sitzungsberichte,
Vol. XCVI, 1887).

The aehiey changes show, with few exceptions, a remarkable paienns
at different places. Mhere are in general two maxima of potential—
one at 8 or 9 o’clock in the morning, and one in the evening. The
evening maximum is the most marked, while at some places, and espe-
cially near towns, the morning maximum disappears. The same gen-
eral features of the daily variation have been found to hold at a number
of European stations, at Cape Horn, Melbourne, and in the Northern
Arctic regions. If the variation is separated into two—one having a
period of twenty-four hours and the other of twelve hours—the latter
is found to agree in phase at widely different places on the earth’s sur-
face, while the former is found to vary to a much greater extent, and
hence to be probably more affected by local circumstances. The
remarkable researches of Hann have given a similar result for the
me —

diurnal variations of the barometer, and we may reasonably conclude
that the semidiurnal variation of atmospheric electricity is connected
with the same circulation in the upper regions of the atmosphere which
shows itself in the corresponding changes of pressure.

In addition to the more regular periodic changes, the electric stress
observed in fine weather shows marked differences on different days
and at different seasons. With respect to these, the researches of Prof.
Franz Exner (ibid.) have led to the important result that there is a
close connection, direct or indirect, between the amount of aqueous
vapor present in the atmosphere and the fall of potential observed at
the surface of the earth. If py) be the pressure of aqueous vapor pres-
ent in centimeters, Exner deduces the equation for electric force P

Rie AS
Sl + kpy
where A = 1300, k = 13.1.

The formula agrees very well with observations in which the vapor
pressure varied between 0.23 and 0.95, and it is especially to be
remarked that it is the amount of vapor and not the humidity which
determines the electric force. Observations made by Mr. E. Drory
during a journey round the world fit in very well with Exner’s formula,
and observations made at such widely different places as Suez, Albany,
Sydney, Colombo, and Penang showed a fall of potential practically
identical with that calculated from the above formula, though the same
constants were taken and the vapor pressure varied between 0.8 em.
and 2.2 cm.

Messrs. Julius Elster and Hans Geitel (Wiener Akad. Sitzungs-
berichte, Vol. CI, 1892) have followed up this research. Their investi-

gations have shown a satisfactory agreement with Exner’s formula, if

the mean values of a number of observations in which the vapor pres-
sure iS approximately the same are considered. But individual num-
bers differ very widely from the mean, so that the formula can not be
used to predict the normal fall of potential on any particular day.
There is, perhaps, nothing surprising in the great divergence of such
individual results if it is considered that we only observe the moisture
near the surface of the earth, but are ignorant of the total amount of
water in the column of air over the district in which the observations
are carried out. The same authors have shown that an equally good
agreement can be obtained if, instead of the amount of aqueous vapor,
we take the intensity of active radiation as the determining circum-
stance. The hight might be supposed to act on the general surface of
the earth, as it does according to Hallwachs’ observations on a metallic
body, dissipating a regular charge. There are some difficulties in the
way of this explanation, the most serious being the absence of experi-
mental evidence that sunlight actually does act in the manner indicated
on any substance forming part of the earth’s surface. It is impossible
at the present time to enter more fully into this subject, but attention

must be drawn to the very important indirect result, that there seems
*o be a connection between ultra-violet radiations and the amount of
aqueous vapor present in the air.

The phenomena of atmospheric electricity have been studied at the
mountain observatory established on the “Sonnblick,” in Salzburg, at
a height of 3,100 meters.

The important result has been established that the electric force is
singularly constant. The great differences observed at low level
between the electric field in summer and winter, or on dry and wet
days, seems to be completely absent, and these facts tend to support
the conclusion derived from balloon observation, that the positive ends
of the lines of force are situated at a height of something like 10,000
feet.

Brief allusion must be made to some of the causes which alter to a
marked extent the normal fall of potential. As the surface of the
earth is negatively electrified, it follows that dust carried up by the
wind must be electrified, and it is found, indeed, that in violent dust
storms the laws of force near the surfaces are altogether distorted and
reversed in direction. Werner Siemens (Pogg. Ann., CIX, 1860;
Metecrologische Zeitschrift, 1890, p. 252) could, while standing on the
top of one of the pyramids during a strong wind, charge an improvised
Leyden jar sufficiently to obtain strong sparks. A casual observation
of Elster and Geitel (Ziele und Methoden, p. 11) may prove significant.
On March 7, 1889, the temperature in Wolfenbiittel was rising from —10°
C. to + 2° C., a cirrus layer covering the sky. The fall of potential
changed in the course of four hours from 1,302 volts per meter to —1,200
volts—that is, from a very exceptionally high fall to an equally strong
gradient in the other direction. Although the atmospheric circum-
stances were anomalous, they seem in themselves not sufficient to
account for the anomalous electrical effects, and the authors suggest
that a possible explanation may be found in a violent dust storm which
on the previous day was observed in Alexandria. :

Fogs are generally found to increase the normal fall considerably, so
that the drops of water must be taken as positively electrified.

Waterfalls considerably disturb the electric condition of the air in
their neighborhood, the air surrounding the fall being charged nega-
tively, sometimes to considerable distances.

Whether clouds in themselves are always electrified is very doubtful;
they no doubt disturb and generally weaken the fall of potential at the
earth’s surface, but this may only be due to a displacement of a posi-
tively-electrified layer which balloon observations have shown to exist
at a height of from 10,000 feet to 20,000 feet. While a cloud discharges
rain, the electrical effects in the neighborhood of the place are the |
same as that in the neighborhood of a waterfall. The explanation is
probably the same in the two cases, and by means of experiments,
alluded to farther on, we may reproduce the negative electrification of
air under similar circumstances.
ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 99

Measurements of the electrification of falling rain or snow, simple as
they appear at first sight, are beset with very serious difficulty. We
owe the most complete investigation on the point to Messrs. Hister and
Geitel (Wiener Sitzungsberichte, Vol. XCIX, 1890). They find no
regularity in the electrification, though positive signs slightly prepon-
derate with snow and negative signs with rain.

The approach of a thunderstorm announces itself by characteristic
cumuli clouds, and the general atmospheric condition favorable to their
formation is felt by many persons of nervous temperament. Many of
us are accustomed to hear that ‘there is thunder in the air.” What-
ever the special feeling of “thunder” may be due to, it can not be an
electrical effect, for electrical instruments delicate enough to detect a
small fraction of the normal force, give no indications of the approach
of a thunderstorm, and it is only when the cloud has begun to dis-
charge rain or hail that strong electrical effects are noticed. During
the thunderstorm the electroscope is, of course, much disturbed, and
there are frequent and violent reversals of its indications.!. The fact
that no effects are observed at the surface of the earth during the
approach of a thundercloud does not prove that there is no electrical
separation, for we may imagine two oppositely electric layers at different
levels producing a strong electric field between them, but only weak
effects outside. That some such things may possibly occur is indicated
by observations made in mountain districts, where violent electrical
disturbances are observed previous to the formation of clouds (‘Trabert,
Meteorologische Zeitschrift, 1889, p. 342). The cumulus cloud, from
which the lightning strikes out, is nearly always associated with a
cirrus layer above it, and the flash occurs more frequently upward or
sideward between the clouds than down to earth. Under such cir-
cumstances it is clear that instruments on the surface of the earth can
only very partially indicate the nature and distribution of electrical
stress in the neighborhood of the cloud.

Thunderstorms seem always to be connected with a vortex motion,
and meteorologists distinguish two kinds of thunderstorms. The first
kind forms in the outlying portions of a large cyclonic system. The
storms which occur in winter are mostly of this nature, and the vortex
necessary for its formation is of the nature of a secondary disturbance.
The thunderstorm which forms in summer, on the other hand, makes
its own vortex, and is of a much more local character than that which
is produced round a previously established barometric depression. The
-summer storm is much influenced by the character of a district. There
are certain configurations apparently favorable to its formation, as is
clearly brought out by the charts which have been made representing
their frequency.

The route traveled over by the storm is affected by mountain ridges,
and rivers also seem to offer a peculiar impediment. Many of them

Ziele und Methoden luftelektrischer Untersuchungen,” Wolfenbiittel, 1891. é

are brought to an end either along their whole front, or only part of
it, when they reach the banks of a large river.!

Some curious problems are presented by the detailed structure of
lightning flashes. Although these lie outside the range of the present
lecture, reference must be made to the very beautiful photographs of
lightning flashes taken both in this country and abroad. The ordinary
forms which lightning takes are familiar to all, but a good deal of
mystery still surrounds the so-called globular lightning. The manner
in which this form appears is best described in the words of eye-
witnesses.

Dr. A. Wartmann gives to the Physical Society of Geneva the fol-
lowing account of what he saw:?

‘At half-past 6 o’clock in the evening I drove from Versoix to Gen-
thoud. On the Malagny road I heard the coachman say he did not
know where he was. His eyes were so much fatigued by the frequent
and intense lightning discharges that he was blinded and could not,
even in the intervals, see the road, in spite of the good lanterns along-
side. I stepped on to the box and took the reins. We had barely
passed the principal gate of the grounds of Dr. Marcet when I became
conscious of a bright and lasting luminosity behind me. Thinking it
was a fire, I turned round, and saw, at a distance of, roughly, 300 meters,
a ball of fire of about 40cm. diameter. It traveled in our direction with
a velocity about equal to that of a bird of prey, and left no luminous
trail behind. Just as the ball had overtaken us, about 24 meters to our
right, it burst with a terrific noise, and it seemed to me as if lines of
fire started from it. We felt a violent shaking, and remained blinded
a few seconds. As soon as I regained power of distinguishing objects
I saw that the horses had turned at a right angle to the carriage, with
their chests in the hedge, with drooping ears and all signs of great ter-
ror. I returned on the following day to the place where I had seen the
ball explode, but could find no sign of any damage. At a distance of
100 meters I found that a group of three trees, bordering a wood, had
their upper branches singed, but it is not possible to say whether this
was due to the discharge which I had seen.”

The following is a translation of an account given by Mr. H. W. Roth
(Meteorologische Zeitschrift, 1889, p. 231):

‘During the thunderstorm of May 19, 1888, at about 6 p. m., a flash
of lightning took effect which seems to me remarkable from a physio-
logical point of view. The dealer Werner, from Ellerbruch, and his son
(16 years old), with a one-horse conveyance containing rags, were on
the road which leads from here to the village of Ottensen, about 3 miles
away in a southwesterly direction. The father had been left a little
behind, and the son was occupied in giving bread to the horses, when
he found himself suddenly surrounded by light, and noticed a fiery ball,
about the size of his fist, moving toward him along the back of the
horse. Then he lost consciousness. He felt no concussion. The father,
on approaching, saw the horse’s limbs still contracting, and at first he
thought his son was dead, but succeeded, after considerable efforts, in
bringing him back to life in about three-quarters of an hour. The horse
was dead.”

ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 101

Some curious statistics have been collected, especially in Germany,
as to the damage done by lightning flashes. That damage seems to
have increased to an enormous extent within the last fifty years, and
although in cases of this kind statistics may easily be at fault, there
seems no doubt about the reality of the fact, which may find an expla-
nation in the partial cutting down of forests in those parts where
thunderstorms chiefly occur. When lightning strikes into forests, it
selects certain trees by preference. Thus, in the principality of Lippe,
taking the percentage of beeches struck by lightning as unity, that
for other trees is as follows: Oak, 48; spruce fir, 5; Scotch fir, 33.

The St. Elmo’s fire, a continuous discharge from points and sharp
angles, is often observed on board ship and in mountain districts during
a storm. Its appearance was considered a sign of the approaching end
of the lightning, and was looked upon with favor by the ancient sailors
in the Mediterranean Sea, who gave to it the name of Castor and
Pollux. There was another appearance called Helena, a bad omen,
which by many is believed to have been another form of the St. Elmo’s
fire, and the present name has been stated to be a corruption of the
word Helena. Some support is given to this view by the fact that the
Emperor Constantine built a castle in the Pyrenees, which he named
after his mother, Helena, and this castle seems to be referred to ocea-
sionally as St. Elne or St. Elme. But it is much more probable, as
argued by Dr. F. Piper (Pogg. Ann., Vol. LX XXII, p. 317), that the
word is derived from St. Erasmo, a bishop who came from Antiochia,
and suffered a martyr’s death at the beginning of the fourth century.
He seems to have been specially considered the patron of Italian sailors.
Churches and castles in Naples and Malta were called St. Erasmo and
St. Ermo, and Ariosto describes St. Elmo’s fires as St. Ermo’s fires.
The electric discharge which goes under this name has a different
appearance according as it is the positive or negative electricity which
escapes, and both kinds occur with about equal frequency.

Although we have not yet arrived at any satisfactory theory of
atmospheric electricity, some progress has been made, and this account
would not be complete without a short account of the views taken by
men of science on the subject. The number of theories proposed is
very considerable. Dr. Suchsland,' in a pamphlet published in 1886,
gives an account of twenty-four, to which he adds one—his own. The
year 1884 alone has given birth to four theories.

We may group the theories according to the origin they assign to
the source of energy which is involved in the formation of the electric
field. All the work we can perform is either derived from the sun or
from the earth’s rotation. There is, as far as I know, only one theory—
that of Edlund—which makes the earth’s rotation in space responsible
for the separation of electricities in the atmosphere. But Edlund’s
views are not tenable in theory, and, even granting his deductions, the

normal fall of potential should, according to the views of the author,
have a different sign in the polar and equatorial regions, which is con-
trary to the observed fact. This theory does not, however, exhaust
the possibility of explaining atmospheric electricity as a phenomenon
of electromagnetic induction, and it is not disproved that in some form
or other the rotation of the earth’s magnetic field may play a part in
the origin of the electric field. The theories which take solar radiation
as the source of the energy divide themselves into several groups.
We may think of a direct thermoelectric or actinic action, but there
is, So far, no experimental support to such views. One of the earliest
and most natural suppositions is the belief. in evaporation as a source
of electrification. This was Volta’s theory, and experiments have at
various times been produced in its support; but so far no one has been
able to invalidate Faraday’s conclusion that whenever electrification
seemed to appear aS a consequence of evaporation, it was really due
to secondary causes, such as the friction of the liquid spray against
the sides of the containing vessel. Rejecting Volta’s theory, there is
nothing left but the belief in some form of contact or frictional elec-
tricity either between drops of water and air or water and ice, or any
two of the various bodies present in the atmosphere. The possibility
of contact electricity between a solid or liquid and a gas is not quite
easy to submit to the test of experiment. If we rub two solid bodies
together, we may, by separating them, investigate the electric field
produced; but, supposing we have a drop of water surrounded on all
sides by air, the water may be covered with an electric layer of, say,
positive electricity, the air in contact with the water with the opposite
kind, and it is not at all clear how we could experimentally demonstrate
the difference of potential between the air and the drop which is thus
produced. A current of air flowing past the drop might carry away
some of the negative layer, and in this way an electric field may be
established while clouds are forming, but the conditions necessary for
an experimental demonstration would be very difficult to realize. Two
methods have been devised which practically demonstrate some form
of contact electricity between gases and water.

Lenard, wishing to imitate the electric field observed in the neigh-
borhood of waterfalls, has established by careful experiment a number
of important facts, which are all consistent with the following explana-
tion. If we imagine two oppositely electrified layers at the surface of
a drop of water such as has been referred to, and if the drop falls on to
a layer of the same liquid, or if similar drops impinge on each other,
the difference of potential produced by the fusion of the surface layers
becomes greater than is consistent with equilibrium. For, taking the
case of drops falling into a mass of water contained in a cylindrical
vessel, the extent of surface between air and water is not increased
by the falling drops, and we must imagine that surface to be already
covered with a sufficient electrical sheet to establish the required dif-
ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 103

ference of potential. The electrification of the drops is, therefore, not
wanted, and a change in the distribution takes place. The natural
supposition would be that this equilibrium would be restored very
quickly through the surface of the water, but a certain time seems to
be required for this. Meanwhile, the strong current of air which in
Lenard’s experiments is brought down with the water drops carry some
of the electricity away, the water remaining positive. More recent
experiments of Lord Kelvin’s, with air bubbling through water, point
similarly to contact forces between gases and liquids, and in these
experiments also it appears that a considerable time is required to
establish electric equilibrium between a gas and a solid. Lenard finds
very important differences caused by small impurities in the water, the
water acting much more strongly when it is pure. If it contains as
much salt as is contained in the sea, the effect is reversed, and the air
becomes positively electrified. The explanation which is given above
is practically that of Lenard, whose observations have been confirmed
and further extended by Prof. J. J. Thomson. These experiments, no
doubt, account for the behavior of air in the neighborhood of water-
falls, and they probably also explain the negative electrification of air
in the neighborhood of districts in which rain is falling. The strong
positive electrification of mist may also be due to the same cause.

There seems to be no doubt that the formation of a cloud is often
accompanied by electrical effects. A few years ago, descending from
the Dent Blanche, I found myself, after sunset, at a height of about
12,000 feet. A current of air was apparently blowing up the valley
which stretches from Evolena toward Ferpecle, and I could observe a
cloud condensing below me at a height a little below the snow line.
As night came on and we continued our descent over the glacier and
down the valley, a series of electric discharges were noticed between
the cloud, which was lying in a deep-cut valley, the sides of the moun-
tain, and the blue sky overhead. Here the moist air was evidently
streaming through the cloud, depositing its moisture in the form of
drops, and it seemed the most natural explanation at the time that the
air left the cloud in an electrified state.

But while by means of experiments we have been able to produce
some of the phenomena of atmospheric electricity, we have other
important effects which can not be accounted for in so simple a way.
The electric discharges during a thunderstorm give evidence of electric
fields which could hardly be explained by contact electricity between
drops of water and air alone. The fact that thunderstorms are nearly
always connected with the formation of hail, and Faraday’s experi-
ments showing that water rubbing against ice becomes negatively elec-
trified, is made use of in the theories of Sohnke and Luvini. It is quite
likely that there is some truth in these theories. Their weak point lies
in the difficulty of seeing how particles of ice and water can be first
sufficiently mixed to allow of friction, and then become sufficiently
104 ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY.

separated to produce an electric field of such magnitude as we know
must exist in a thundercloud.

It is to be remarked, however, that the laws of contact electricity
must be applicable to gases as well as to solids, and that if water
becomes positive when rubbing against air, and negative when rubbing
against ice, there must be a strong contact difference between ice and
air. In other words, it does not matter whether there is direct friction
between ice and water, or whether the air forms an intermediate body.
We may imagine air rising through a cloud containing drops of water
negatively electrified, and then passing through an ice cloud having
its negative electricity increased, thus leaving the ice and water par-
ticles at a difference of potential which may, by a fusion of the drops,
increase sufficiently to produce a lightning discharge. This seems to
me the most plausible theory which, in the present state of our knowl-
edge, can be formed. As regards the permanent negative charge of
the earth’s surface, the time has not yet arrived for forming a definite
opinion. Although we know that the earth, once electrified, would
gradually lose its charge into the atmosphere, yet we can express no
opinion as to the rate at which the loss is.going on. That loss may
be exceedingly slow, and consequently equilibrium might be attained
by a very small preponderance of negative electricity brought back to
its surface through some cause or other. Rain, as has already been
mentioned, is more frequently electrified negatively than positively in
our own climate, and though we do not know how far this holds in the
tropical belt, it is at any rate possible that the surface of the earth may
in this way alone make up for the loss. We may also reasonably think
that Lenard’s observation on salt water may account for the permanent
charge. Every wave that breaks into spray under the action of a
strong wind would leave the water negatively electrified, the air carry-
ing away the positive charge. It would be of great interest to possess
observations on atmospheric electricity on board ship while waves are
breaking in the neighborhood. So far we have only Exner’s observa-
tions to guide us, who found, while observing at Lavinia, in Ceylon,
that the spray from breaking waves affected the indications of the
electrometer, proving its positive electrification (Wiener Akad. Sit-
zungsberichte, Vol. XCVIII).

But although the loss of electricity from the earth’s surface may be
very slow, it is equally possible that it is considerable. We shall not
be able to treat this question satisfactorily until we have some clearer
notion of the causes of the aurora. We know that the aurora implies
electric currents, and the circuit of these currents may lie completely
within the earth’s atmosphere, and have nothing to do with the observed
fall of potential near the ground. It is also possible that the body of
the earth forms part of the electric circuit, and if that is the case,
there must be across different parts of the surface an outward and
inward flow of positive electricity. Such a discharge could not fail to
ATMOSPHERIC ELECTRICITY. 105

influence the phenomena we have discussed, and it seems probable that
we should have some evidence derived from observation if the aurora
was always accompanied by discharges through the earth’s surface.
Except in the polar regions, these aurore do not seem to affect the
normal fall of potential. There is a third view we may take as to the
circulation of electric currents indicated by the aurora—the return cur-
rent may take place in space outside the earth’s atmosphere. A good
deal might be said in favor of this view, and the rotation of the earth’s
magnetic field in space might be a sufficient cause for the production
of these currents; but this is not the place to enter further into this
question.

Calculations made from observation on the height of the aurora have
generally resulted in an altitude of from 100 to 200 miles, except in the
polar regions, where the aurora seems occasionally to desvend to a
much lower level. It has also been noticed that auror are associated
with certain bands of cirrus clouds, and this seems to indicate that
although the luminous phenomena is sufficiently intense to be observed
at only great heights, yet the electric phenomena may descend to the
level of the cirrus.

As regards the connection between the aurora and the sun-spot
period, further observations in the polar regions are needed. On the
one hand, we have Paulsen’s! statement, derived from observations in
Greenland, to the effect that the greatest number of aurore are seen
when sun spots are at their minimum—that is, at a time when in our
own latitudes the number is smallest; and, on the other hand, we have
Nordenskiéld’s observations, which seem to point in the opposite direc-
tion. In a publication which contains much important matter on the
geographical distribution and form of the aurora borealis, Nordenskiéld
contrasts the appearances he has observed in the Vega during the
winter of 1878-79, passed in the Bering Straits, with that previously
observed in 1872-75 to the north of Spitzbergen. According to this
author, the aurore, during the minimum sun-spot period in 1878-79,
were ‘“‘hardly worthy of his notice by the side of those observed in
1872-73.” But although only faintly luminous, the aurore of 1879 were
persistent and regular in shape. They did not affect the magnetic field,
and seemed to show a regular and continuous, though weak, electric
discharge. The are and streamers in 1872 were much more brilliant
and much more irregular. Some objection may be raised against these
observations, in so far as they refer to different places, and local cir-
cumstances may have affected the phenomenon; but, in the face of the
very careful description he gives us, we can not as yet accept Paulsen’s
results without further confirmation.

The problem of atmospheric electricity, like that of terrestrial mag-
netism, presents special features in the arctic regions, and until we

possess a greater number of observations in those little accessible parts
of the earth’s surface, many important problems can not be satisfac-
torily solved. Arctic and antarctic expeditions are of interest to scien-
tific men, not because they care much whether we get a few miles
nearer the pole, but because a well-conducted party collects invaluable
information on its journey. Although much remains to be done in the
regions surrounding the north magnetic pole, our knowledge in the
southern hemisphere is almost disgracefully inadequate, and it is to be
hoped that before long a well-equipped expedition may fill up to a cer-
tain extent the large gaps in our electrical. and magnetical knowledge
which at present stop so many of our researches.

But although investigations to be conducted in the arctic regions are
of primary importance, we may do much nearer home in extending and
completing existing information. Instrumental appliances and meth-
ods of observation, originally put into a satisfactory state by Lord
Kelvin, have been improved, especially by Maseart, Exner, Elster, and
Geite]. One of our most crying wants at present is a series of contin-
uous observations by means of self-registering instruments in places
where the neighborhood of a town or other local circumstances do not
interfere with the normal changes. The Greenwich Observatory, to
which we look for help in such matters, is placed in the difficulty that
the daily variations there observed are markedly different from those
in the majority of places, and it is ‘probable that the nearness of Lon-
don is fatal to any generally useful series of observations of atmospheric
electricity being conducted in our national observatory.
THE GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS|!

By Errrick W. CREAK.

If necessity be the surest prompter of invention, it is not too much
to say that the necessity of the navigator has been a most potent factor
in producing the observer of the elements of terrestrial magnetism.
The traveler on land might rest during darkness until daylight enabled
him to resume his journey; but the seaman on the trackless ocean was
dependent upon the indications of his compass by day and night; and
after the discovery of Columbus that the magnetic declination or varia-
tion of the needle from the direction of the geographical north varied
in amount with the latitude and longitude, a new impetus was given
to observation.

The publication of Gilbert’s grand discovery that the earth is a
magnet and the director of the freely suspended needle, followed by the
discovery of the secular change in the value of the declination, natur-
ally added to the desire of both landsmen and seamen to know as
much as possible concerning that great magnet, both from purely
scientific reasons and to meet the practical ends of the navigator.
Thus the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries were remarkable for
the number of observers both of the magnetic dip and declination.

So important had a correct knowledge of the declination become to
the requirements of navigation, as early as the close of the seventeenth
century, that Halley, under the immediate auspices of the Government,
made his celebrated voyage over the Atlantic Ocean in a man-ot-war,
in order that intelligent observation should set at rest much that was
doubtful. The results of this voyage, combined with the observations
of previous navigators, were embodied in his celebrated chart of lines of
equal value of magnetic variation or declination, the first of its kind
and of so convenient a form that charts of equal values of the three
magnetic elements are to this day the most acceptable form for repre-
senting the combined results of magnetic observations made over large
areas of sea and land, as well as of the special magnetic surveys which
in recent years have been made in various countries.

108 GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.

Here we may pause to consider the word declination as applied to the
angle which the direction of the horizontal magnetic needle makes with
the true meridian. Many magneticians object to the word, but no bet-
ter has yet been proposed, or at any rate accepted; the result being that
while observers on land use the term, seamen adhere firmly to the expres-
sion ‘‘variation of the compass.” This is as might be expected, when
itis remembered that navigators look upon the word declination as con-
nected with the position of the sun and other heavenly bodies, and
would find it most inconvenient to have the same word in daily use,
meaning two totally different things.

During the eighteenth century charts of the magnetic declination
were published by Mountaine and Dodson, Bellin, and Churchman, and
for their time may be considered as fair approximations to the truth.
Churchman’s design was not only to give values of the declination but
to furnish the seaman with a means of ascertaining the longitude—an
ambitious project, especially as we now know there were probably con-
siderable elements of error in these charts, caused by local magnetic
disturbance of the observing compass on land, and from the iron used
in construction disturbing the compass on board the ships. :

This latter source of error was only beginning to be viewed in its
true light at the close of the eighteenth century.

In the years 1801-1802 Commander Flinders of H. M.S. Investigator,
then surveying the southern coasts of Australia, found that when his
vessel’s head was north or south by compass the observed declination
agreed very nearly, but when she lay with her head east or west, it dif-
fered largely. Moreover these errors on the east and west points of the
compass had the opposite sign to those observed in England.

Flinders, however, had supplemented the existing scanty knowledge
of the distribution of the dip over navigable waters by several observa-
tions of his own in northern and southern latitudes, and from these he
drew the conclusion that the errors in the declination observed on board
ship were caused by magnetism induced by the earth in the vertical
iron of the ship, and changed in value proportionally to change of dip.
Here Flinders was wrong, as the errors were really proportional to the
tangent of the dip.

In spite of this mistake he was enabled, from his knowledge of the
dip, to conceive the idea of so placing vertical bars of iron that they
produced an equal and opposite effect on the compass to that of the
ship in all latitudes, and thus invented what is now called the Flinders
bar, one of the most important correctors of compass disturbance in
the iron and steel ships of the present day.

In 1814 Flinders induced the Admiralty to have experiments made
on board men-of-war at Portsmouth, Sheerness, and Devonport, to
ascertain the amount of the magnetic disturbance of the compass
caused by the iron in each ship. The chief reason for making these
experiments was to show the necessity for ascertaining and applying
GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS. 109

these errors to insure the safe navigation of the ships, but it had also a
direct bearing in enabling observers to eliminate the hitherto inexpli-
cable divergencies in the values of the declination observed in different
ships in the same geographical position. The results of these experi-
ments bore no immediate fruit, for with the death of Flinders the sub-
ject was temporarily neglected.

In 1819, Hansteen published his Magnetismus der Erde with an atlas
containing charts of the elements declination and dip for different
epochs between the years 1600 and 1787. These charts were in a large
measure compiled from observations made with imperfect instruments
and subject to the causes of error already mentioned attending both
land and sea results. Hansteen, however, considered them of sufficient
value to enable him to draw certain important conclusions with regard
to the cause of the secular change of the magnetic elements. Thus, he
not only concurred with Halley that the earth, considered as a magnet,
had four poles or points of attraction, but computed their geographical
positions. Further than this, he computed that to account for the
secular change these four supposed poles revolved round the terres-
trial poles, each pole occupying a widely different number of years to
complete the revolution.

If these theoretical results had been true, a great advance would
have been made not only in the science of terrestrial magnetism but
in its practical bearing on the requirements of the present day.

Although Humboldt had about the year 1800 shown that the intensity
of the earth’s magnetism varied with the latitude, the general distribu-
tion of that magnetic element was so little known that we may witl
our present extended knowledge consider that Hansteen’s conclusions
were based on insufficient data. In fact the idea of the earth being a
magnet with four poles has long since been abandoned in favor of there
being one pole with two foci of intensity in each hemisphere, and
reasons will be given further on which tend to throw doubt on there
being any revolution of these two magnetic poles round their adjacent
terrestrial poles.

Subsequently to Hansteen’s charts there appeared those of the
declination by Yeates, Duperrey, and by Barlow in 1836. These were
useful to navigation, but helped very little toward the solution of the
problem of the ever variable distribution of the earth’s magnetism.

Besides this, by the year 1835 the iron-built ship had appeared on the
ocean, and a correct knowledge of the three magnetic elements became
a necessity in solving the problems which the magnetism of different
iron ships presented.

With Gauss’s invention of the absolute horizontal force magneto-
meter in 1833, many hitherto unknown movements of the magnetic
needle of the highest interest were discovered, which with the coarser
instruments previously in use lay concealed. This discovery gave the
desired impetus to the scientific men of that epoch, and the period
110 GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.

included in the years 1835-1845 was ‘a time of unparalleled activity
in the extension of systematic and accurate magnetical observations
over the earth’s surface.”

Whilst most of the continental nations joined in this movement, the
principal share in the work was divided between Germany, Russia,
and England in Europe, and the United States in America. But
before the splendid series of simultaneous observations made on the
continent, and four British colonial observatories were organized,
Gauss in 1839 published his general theory of terrestrial magnetism
coupled with a series of charts of the three magnetic elements for the
whole world, based upon observations made at ninety-two selected
stations distributed over the earth’s surface; and it may be remarked
that Gauss’s charts not only gave results in fair accordance with
observation in explored regions, but also as afterwards proved in
Antarctic latitudes hitherto unvisited by man.

The proof came in the years 1839-1843, when Koss’s Antarctic
voyage of exploration was carried out in the interests of terrestrial
magnetism. Besides the importance of a knowledge of the general
distribution of the magnetic elements in those regions, one great aim
of this expedition was to reach the south magnetic pole. This was
found to be impossible, but sufficient data were collected to give its
approximate position. Whilst this Antarctic magnetic survey was
being completed, that of British North America was also undertaken,
' with the result of the determination of the locality of one of the foci of
greatest intensity in the northern hemisphere.

The results of these surveys formed, as will be well remembered, a
valuable series of ‘‘contributions” to terrestrial magnetism by Sabine,
and, coupled with every available observation between the years 1818
to 1876, formed the materials for the series of charts entitled ‘“ The
Magnetic Survey of the Globe” for the epoch 1842-1845. Hach map
gave normal lines of equal values of the declination, inclination, and
intensity. Although it may be said that from the Arctic circle to the
Antarctic the direction of the lines was efficiently given by observa-
tion, the lines within those circles were largely taken from Gauss’s
computed lines modified to agree with observation.

Another difficulty in compiling these charts of Sabine’s with accuracy
lay in the uncertain knowledge of the secular change then available,
and which had to be applied to observations made so far apartin time.

Sabine’s charts are doubtless the best we have for the epoch 1842-1845,
but in the light of the requirements of modern science they leave much
to be desired as regards the Antarctic regions. Theobservations south
of 60° south were made entirely on board ships, where the errors of
the compass sometimes exceeded 50°, due to the horizontal forces in
the ship, thus rendering accurate observations of the declination very
uncertain and correction of the observed inclination very difficult;
besides which there are no records of the ship’s disturbing force in the
vertical direction.
GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS. 1a oi!

Naval requirements, however, did not permit of any delay in pub-
lishing magnetic charts affecting navigation, for in 1846 the hydrog-
rapher of the Admiralty requested Sabine to provide charts of the
declination for the Atlantic Ocean from 60° north to 60° south. These
were largely used until Evans’s chart of the declination for the whole
navigable world was issued in 1858.

The excellent work of Flinders already referred to, of ascertaining
from his knowledge of terrestrial magnetism the chief cause of the
deviation of the compass in wood-built ships, and providing a corrector
for those deviations, had to be followed up on a much larger scale and
with more exact methods in the iron-built ship, which, in that period
of activity in terrestrial magnetic science—1835-1845—was rapidly
increasing in numbers on the ocean.

Thus in 1835 observations were made on board iron ships showing
that they acted as a magnet on their compasses, but there was nothing
to show in the results what the causes of this condition of the iron ship
were, until Poisson in 1838 published his celebrated ‘‘Memoir on the
deviations of the compass produced by the iron in a ship.” This was
a rigorous mathematical investigation of the subject, showing that the
deviations of the compass were due to induction in the ship by the
magnetic force of the earth.

If the iron ship had simply been built for service in one locality, a
limited knowledge of terrestrial magnetism would have sufficed te eluci-
date the causes of her magnetic condition; but she was destined to
traverse every navigable sea over large changes of magnetic latitude,
hence the necessity for an accurate knowledge of the distribution of
magnetism over the great parent magnet, in order to determine the
magnetic condition of her comparatively minute offspring the magnet-
ized iron ship; and this at all times and in all places in the interests
of navigation. Observations of the terrestrial magnetic elements were
therefore an absolute necessity if iron-built ships were to be substi-
tuted for those of wood.

The ability to predict the deviation of the compass on change of lati-
tude did not, however, satisfy Airy, for after a remarkable mathemati-
cal investigation of iron ship’s magnetism of a less rigorous character
than Poisson’s, but sufficiently accurate for his purpose, he in 1839 pro-
posed his methods of annulling the deviation of a ship’s compass by
means of magnets and soft iron, so arranged as to produce equal and
opposite magnetic effects to that of the ship. Provided with Airy’s
admirable and simple directions this method of correction was com-
paratively easy in one latitude, but experience at sea, especially in
voyages to the Cape of Good Hope, showed that every iron ship required
a different application of Airy’s correctors.

To discriminate between the amount that was to be corrected by per-
manent magnets, by horizontal soft iron, and by vertical soft iron, an
accurate knowledge of the magnetic elements dip and intensity obtained
from observations on land and at sea was essential.
nn? GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS.

Before dismissing the subject of the above application of magnetic
observations, it may be remarked that we have now heavily armed
protected steel cruisers steaming over all parts of the world with less
change of deviation of the compass than the wood-built Hrebus and
Terror of Ross’s Antarctic expedition, and this remarkable result could
not have been achieved if the terrestrial magnetic observer had not
done his work.

Moreover, if magnetic observations are not continued, the secular
change of the magnetic elements will soon commence to mar the pre-
cision with which our rapidly-moving ships traverse the globe.

The voyage of the Challenger in 1872-1876 contributed the most
valuable series of observations of the magnetic elements in modern
times, when the large areas of the principal oceans traversed by that
vessel during three and a half years are taken into consideration.
These observations, combined with those taken from every available
source, both British aud foreign, between the years 1865-1887, formed
the materials from which the magnetic charts of 1880 were compiled
(see Vol. 11, Physics and Chemistry, part 6, voyage of H. M.S. Challenger).

The Challenger only crossed the Antarctic circle at one point in lon-
gitude 78° east, and, therefore, although we know large secular changes
to be going on south of 40° south, we have no measure of the amount,
nor anything like an accurate knowledge of distribution of the earth’s
magnetism in those regions. This points to the necessity for a new
Antarctic expedition.

In the year 1888 the late Prof. J. ©. Adams was provided with a
complete set of magnetic charts for the two epochs 1842-1845 and 1880
previously mentioned, and as it was known he had directed his pro-
found mathematical ability to the analysis of the results contained in
them, it was hoped that some new and important light might be thrown
upon the bare facts presented. His lamented death occurred without
his publishing any results.

If, however, reference be made to the report on the magnetical
results of the Challenger, a discussion of the secular change 1s con-
tributed, founded in a great measure on a comparison of those charts.
The outcome of this discussion is to throw considerable doubt upon
the theory that the motion of the magnetic poles round the terrestrial
is the cause of secular change; in fact, that the magnetic poles remain
fast, and we must look elsewhere for the cause, whatever it may be.

Magnetic observations have so far been considered in their all-
important bearing as necessary to safe navigation in wood-built ships,
and in a far higher sense as indispensable to that of the iron or steel-
built ships which now cover the ocean, the magnetic charts hitherto
generally required for these purposes being those on which normal
lines of equal values have been given; but something more is now
needed.

Observution in comparatively recent years has shown that not only

|
GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS. eke

are there large “regional” magnetic disturbances extending over large
areas of land, but that in moderate depths of water where the largest
ship can navigate freely, the land below is also found to have consider-
able areas of local magnetic disturbance which, if not allowed for,
may in thick or foggy weather lead ships into danger by seriously
disturbing their compasses. :

The United States has done excellent work in producing charts of
isomagnetic lines, or charts in which the chief local magnetic disturb-
ances are recognized, and the full results of observation recorded.
The magnetic surveys of Riicker and Thorpe in the British Isles, of
Moureau in France, of Rijckevorsel in Holland and elsewhere, have
thrown considerable light on the magnetic conditions of those countries,
but there remain whole continents to be covered by the observer.

The direction of the isomagnetics, too, from the deep sea to the dry
land of the coasts is an extension of the subject which the observer
has hardly touched as yet, but one affecting the safety of navigation,
as well as the question that has been raised, whether the water areas
of the globe are, as a whole, more or less magnetized than the land
areas. ;

To possess charts of isomagnetic lines for even a few countries is an
evidence of considerable advance in the knowledge of terrestrial mag-
netism, for if reference be made to Sabine’s lines of intensity in his
contribution on the magnetic survey of Northwest America it will be
found that he rejected certain observations he considered abnormal and
defective, which Lefroy, the observer, considered to be his best and
naturally retained in his map; the result being a considerable difference
in the form of the curves adopted by the two magneticians, Sabine giy-
ing normal curves, Lefroy isomagnetics.

Respecting the local disturbances of the needle which have been so
clearly proved, the question naturally arises, Whence the cause of these
disturbances? It is now believed by many, if not finally accepted, that
Riicker and Thorpe have answered the question by the results of their
laborious survey of the British Isles, coupied with Riicker’s elegant
investigations as to the permeability of specimens of the rocks taken
from the localities in which magnetic disturbances were found. Their
answer is to the effect that these disturbances, which have been found
to extend over a region 230 miles long by about 110 miles broad, are
due to induction by the earth’s magnetism in rocks of different per-
meability, either present as in the basalts on the surface or concealed
by superficial deposits.

These results are distinct from the extraordinary disturbances of the
needle when in the immediate vicinity of permanently magnetized
rocks, and when the radius of disturbance may be only as many feet
as the extent of the regional disturbance is in miles.

The points of interest in the question of regional magnetic disturb-
ance are not confined to the magnetician, for the geologist can not

afford to neglect the valuable information the magnetic needle affords.
Thus although Riicker and Thorpe have since made a second and more
elaborate survey of the British Isles, their remark of 1890 that “the
kingdom can be divided into magnetic districts in which the relations
between the direction of the disturbing forces and the main geological
characteristics are so suggestive as to be worthy of careful statement
and further investigation,” not only holds good, but has received
confirmation.

The mining engineer is deeply interested in a knowledge of the
declination. Charts of normal lines are of great use to him whether
above or below the earth’s surface, but especially below when he has
no other guide. To such an one a knowledge of regional magnetic
disturbance as deduced from surface observations is most important,
as it tells him that he is in the neighborhood of magnetic rocks, the
disturbing effect of which on his compass needle may be far greater
in the depths of his mine and turning it into a treacherous guide.

We have now considered magnetic observations in a measure from
the point of view of the immediate practical results which their scien-
tific treatment produces, but who will say in this great maritime nation
that the work of magnetic observers, even if solely to make navigation
possible, is not worthy of the fullest consideration?

There is besides a vast field of inquiry for the observer of terrestrial
magnetism in unraveling the secrets of the earth considered as a mag-
net, and the ceaseless change of its magnetic condition which the
needle tells us of, for which no immediate practical result can be fore-
seen, yet is worthy of the attention of the ablest physicists and most
advanced mathematicians.

Inquiry into the causes of the secular change is one requiring the
fullest attention, but observation has not yet done sufficient work.
It certainly has done much in certain countries, and for a large portion
of the world as regards secular change in the past, and data obtained
for predicting future changes for a few years, but only one expedition
has examined the Antarctic regions magnetically, and it is doubtful if
any substantial progress will be made until a second expedition is
made thither, one profiting by the experience of its precursor, and
equipped with possibilities for work hardly hoped for by Ross.

It may be remarked in passing that a remarkable alteration in the
amount of the secular change has been noticed in the declination and
inclination at the following observatories: Bombay, Batavia, and Hong
Kong about the period of the eruption of Krakatoa in 1883. This may
be only a coincidence, but may it not also point to the possibility that
the changes below the surface of the earth which culminated in that
mighty explosion, and may still be at work, have had, and continue to
have, magnetic effects which are recorded by the needles at those
observatories ?

Critical investigations have for many years been directed to the elu-
cidation of the causes of the observed diurnal variations of terrestrial
GENERAL BEARINGS OF MAGNETIC OBSERVATIONS. 115

magnetism. This work was long seriously retarded by the various
methods adopted at different observatories for recording their results,
obliging those who entered upon a comparison of such results to go
through a tedious conversion of them into a common method. It may
be said that the first large departure from this objectionable practice
occurred when the international polar inquiry of 1882-1883 was under-
taken by the various expeditions.

This was an important step in the right direction, but there remains
much to be done, as shown by the ten reports of the British Associa-
tion Committee on “the best means of comparing and reducing mag:
netic observations.” Their last report consists of an able and suggest-
ive paper by Dr. Chree, being the analysis of the results of five years’
observations on “quiet days” at Kew, and is well worthy of attention
as indicative of the present state of our knowledge as regards the diur-
nal variation of the three magnetic elements.

Such investigations only encourage one in the hope that the much
required observations in southern latitudes may be undertaken. The
observatories at the Cape and Melbourne could do invaluable work if
it were carried out on the lines of Kew, for example.

Lastly, what more is there to be said about magnetic observations
and their bearings? We do not know why the earth is a magnet, the
cause of the secular change of its magnetism, why it is subject to solar
diurna!l, lunar diurnal, sidereal diurnal, and the other variations and
disturbances, nor the cause of magnetic storms, although we can observe
connections between them, earth currents, and aurorae. Whether the
causes of all these exist below the surface of, or are external to, the
earth, or are a combination of the two, has still to be learnt, and it
seems hardly too much to hope that the restless needle will sooner or
later be the means of opening up sources of knowledge invaluable to
cosmical science, as well as to those only concerned with the planet
upon which they dwell.

When the causes of the secular change are understood, there will be
no difficulty in providing the navigator with magnetic charts for years
in advance, much as the tides can now be tabulated for his use. In
the latter case observation has done its work for several frequented
ports, in the former case a vast amount remains to be done, and the
word that goes forth is still, as Lord Kelvin thrice said on a kindred
subject connected with ships’ magnetism, ‘‘ Observe.”
RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS.!

By Prof. W. LECONTE STEVENS.

The reviewer who aspires to give an account of recent progress in
any department of science is met at the outset by two causes for
embarrassment. What beginning shall be selected for developments
called recent? What developments shall be selected for discussion
from the mass of investigations to which his attention has been called?
So rapidly is the army of workers increasing, and so numerous are the
journals in which their work is recorded, that the effort to keep up
with even half of them is hopeless; or, to borrow a simile employed
by the late Professor Huxley, ‘‘We are in the case of Tarpeia, who
opened the gates of the Roman citadel to the Sabines, and was crushed
under the weight of the reward bestowed upon her.”

I have selected a single branch of physics, but one which can scarcely
be treated rigorously as single. From the physical standpoint optics
includes those phenomena which are presented by ether vibrations
within such narrow limits of wave length as can affect the sense of
sight. But these waves can scarcely be studied except in connection
with those of shorter and of longer period. Whatever may be the
instruments employed, the last one of the series through which infor-
mation is carried to the brain is the eye. The physicist may fall into
error by faulty use of his mathematics, but faulty use of the senses is
‘a danger at least equally frequent. Physiological opties has of late
become transferred in large measure to the domain of the psychologist,
but he in turn has adopted many of the instruments as well as the
methods of the physicist. The two can not afford to part company.
If I feel particularly friendly to the psychologist, more so than can be
accounted for by devotion to pure physics, it may be fair to plead the
influence of oid association. If [ am known at all in the scientific
world, the introduction was accomplished through the medium of physi-
ological optics. But, with the limitations imposed, it is not possible
even to do justice to all who have done good work in opties. If promi-
nence is assigned to the work of Americans, it is not necessary to

emphasize that this association is made up of Americans; but, with
full recognition of the greater spread of devotion to pure science in
Europe, of the extreme utilitarian spirit that causes the value of nearly
every piece of work in America to be measured in dollars, we are still
able to present work that has challenged the admiration of Europe,
that has brought EKuropean medals to American hands, that has been
done with absolute disregard of monetary standards; work has been
recognized, even more in HKurope than in America, as producing defi-
nite and important additions to the sum of human knowledge.

In drawing ettention to some of this work it will be a pleasant duty
to recognize also some that has been done beyond the Atlantic—to
remember that science is cosmopolitan. The starting point is neces-
sarily arbitrary, for an investigation may last many years and yet be
incomplete. To note recent progress, it may be important to recall
what is no longer recent.

LIGHT WAVES AS STANDARDS OF LENGTH.

You are therefore invited to recall the subject of an address to which
we listened in this section at the Cleveland meeting in 18388, when
Michelson presented his ‘Plea for light waves.” In this he described
the interferential comparer, an instrument developed from the refrac-
tometer of Jamin and Mascart, and discussed various problems which
seemed capable of solution by its use. In conjunction with Morley he
had already used it in an inquiry as to the relative motion of the earth
and the luminiferous ether (American Journal of Science, May, 1886,
p- 377), and these two physicists together worked out an elaborate series
of preliminary experiments (ibid., December, 1877, p. 427) with a view
to the standardizing of a metric unit of length in terms of the wave
length of sodium light. By use of a Roland diffraction grating, Bell had
determined the sodium wave length with an error estimated to be not
in excess of one part in two hundred thousand (American Journal of
Science, March, 1887, p. 167). Could this degree of accuracy be sur-
passed? If so, it must be not so much by increased care in measure-
ment as by increase of delicacy in the means employed. The principle
applied in the use of the interferential comparer is simple enough; the
mode of application can not be cleary indicated without a diagram, but
probably all physicists have seen this diagram, for it was first brought
out eight years ago (ibid., December, 1887, p. 427). By interference of
beams of light, reflected and transmitted by a plate of plane parallel
optical glass, and then reflected back by two mirrors appropriately
placed, fringes are caught in an observing telescope. One of the mir-
rors is movable in front of a micrometer screw, whose motion causes
these fringes to move across the telescopic field. If the light be abso-
lutely homogeneous, the determination consists in measurement of the
distance through which the movable mirror is pushed parallel to itself
and the counting of the number of fringes which pass a given point in
RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS. 119

the field of view. According to the theory of interference the difference
of path between the distances from one face of the plate to the two
mirrors should be small; beyond a certain limit interference phenomena
vanish, and this limit is smaller in proportion as the light is more com-
plex. In the case of approximately homogeneous light there are peri-
odie variations of distinctness in the fringes. For example, assume
sodium light, which in the spectroscope is manifested as a pair of yellow
lines near together. In the refractometer there are two sets of inter-
ference fringes, one due to each of the two slightly different wave
lengths. When the difference of path is very small, or nearly the same
for both of these radiation systems, the fringes coincide. The wave
length for one is about one thousandth less than that for the other. If
the difference of path is about five hundred waves, the maximum of
brightness for one system falls on a minimum of brightness for the
other, and the fringes become faint. They become again bright when
the difference of path reaches a thousand wave lengths. The case is
entirely similar to the familiar production of beats by a pair of slightly
mistuned forks.

The method of interference thus furnishes through optical beats a
means of detecting radiaticn differences too minute for resolution by
ordinary spectroscopic methods. Spectrum lines are found to be double
or multiple when all other means of resolving them fail; and the diffi-
culty of attaining truly homogeneous light is far greater than was a
few years ago supposed. By the new method it becomes possible to
map out the relative intensities of the components of a multiple line,
their distance apart, and even the variations of intensity within what
has for convenience been called a single component. Each of the two
sodium lines is itself a double whose components are separated by an
interval about one-hundredth of that between the long-known main
components; and an interval yet less than one-fifth of this has been
detected between some of the components of the green line of mercury.
Indeed Michelson deems it quite possible to detect a variation of wave
length corresponding to as little as one ten-thousandth of the interval
between the two main sodium lines (Astronomy and Astrophysics, p. 100,
February 1894).

This new-found complexity of radiation, previously thought to be
approximately if not quite simple, proved to be a temporary barrier to
the accomplishment of the plan of using a light wave as a standard of
length. It necessitated careful study of all those chemical elements
which give bright lines that had been supposed to be simple. The red
line of cadmium has been found the simplest of all those yet examined.
The vapor in a rarefied state is held in a vacuum tube through which
the electric spark is passed, and under this condition the difference of
path for the interfering beams in the refractometer may be a number
of centimeters. A short intermediate standard, furnished with a mirror
at each end, is now introduced into the comparer, and moved by means
120 RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS.

of the micrometer screw. Its length is thus measured in terms of the
cadmium wave length. A series of intermediate standards, of which
the second is double the first, the third double the second, etc., are
thus compared, and finally in this way the value of the meter is reached.

The feasibility of this ingenious method having been made apparent,
Michelson was honored with an invitation from the International Bureau
of Weights and Measures to carry out the measurement at the obser-
vatory near Paris, with the collaboration of the director, M. Benoit.
After many months of labor, results of extraordinary accuracy were
attained. For the red line of cadmium at an air temperature of 15° C.
and pressure of 760 mm., two wholly independent determinations were
made. From the first a meter was found equal to 1,553,162.7 wave
lengths; from the second, 1,553,164.3 wave lengths, giving a mean of
1,553,163.5 the deviation of each result from the mean being very nearly
one part in two millions (‘Travaux et Mémoires du Bureau Interna-
tionale des Poids et Mésures,” Tome XI, p. 84, 1894). A determination
by Benoit from the first series gave 1,553,163.6, which differs but one-
tenth of a wave length from the mean of Michelson’s measurements.

The direct comparison of the lengths of two meter bars, though not
easy, is a sunple operation in comparison with the indirect method just
described, but does not surpass it in accuracy. Everyone knows that
the meter is not ap exact submultiple of the earth’s circumference, and
that the determination of its exact value from the seconds pendulum
is full of difficulty. It may perhaps be said that the optical method is
no more absolute than the pendulum method, for no human measure-
ments can be free from error; that there is no possibility of the
destruction of the original meter and all certified copies of it; and
that there is no proof or probability that molecular changes are grad-
ually producing modifications in standards of length. Even if we
should grant that for all practical purposes the labor of determining
the meter in terms of an unchanging optical standard has been unneces-
sary, the achievement is a signal scientific triumph that ranks with the
brilliant work of Arago, Fresnel, and Regnault. In preparation for it
much new truth has been elicited, and light waves have been shown to
carry possibilities of application that Fresnel never suspected.

The physicist is nearly powerless without the aid of those who possess
the highest order of mechanical skill. The interferential comparer
could never have been utilized for such work as Michelson has done with
it, had not Brashear made its optical parts with such an approach to
perfection that no error so great as one-twentieth of a wave length
could be found upon the reflecting surfaces (‘Travaux et Mémoires
du Bureau Internationale des Poids et Mésures,” Tome XI, p. 5, 1895).
In the conception, mechanical design, and execution the entire work
has been distinctly American.

The interferential refractometer has been used with much skill by
Hallwachs (Wiedemann’s Annalen, Band 47, p. 380, and Band 53, p. 1)
RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS. £21

for comparing the variation of refractive index of dilute solutions with
variation of concentration. The fact of solution brings about a change
of molecular constitution, affecting both the electric conductivity and
the refractive index; and the changes in optical density are measurable
in terms of the number of interference fringes which cross the field of
view for a given variation of dilution.

LUMINESCENCE.

While all work on the visible spectrum is confessedly optical, we can
no longer make an arbitrary division point, and declare that one part
of the spectrum belongs to the domain of optics and the other not.
Since the days of Brewster and the elder Becquerel fluorescent solu-
tions have enabled us to bring within the domain of optics many wave
lengths that were previously invisible. Stokes’s explanation of this,
as a degradation of energy quite analogous to the radiation of heat
from a surface on which sunlight is shining, has been generally accepted.
But whether the phenomena of fluorescence and phosphorescence are
in general physical or chemical, has for the most part remained unknown,
or at least very uncertain. E. Wiedemann, who suggested the term
luminescence to include all such phenomena, published in 1895 (Anna-
len der Physik und Chemie, p. 604, April, 1895), in conjunction with
Schmidt, a part of the outcome of an extended investigation under-
taken with a view to clearing up these uncertainties. He has shown
that it is often possible to distinguish between cases in which the
emission of light springs from physical processes and those in which it
is due to chemical action, or at least invariably accompanied by this.
We have here, as in photography, a transformation of radiant into
chemical energy, to which is superadded the retransformation of chem-
ical into radiant energy of longer period, and this either at the same
time or long after the action of the exciting rays. Indeed, between
this process and that of photography in colors, the analogy is quite
striking. What has generally been called phosphorescence is well
known to be the effect of oxidation in the case of phosphorus itself and
in that of decaying wood or other organic matter, which under certain
conditions shines in the dark.

Wiedemann has shown that the shining of Balmain’s luminous paint,
and generally of the sulphides of the alkaline earths, is accompanied
with chemical action. A long period of luminosity after the removal
of the source renders highly probable the existence of what he now
calls chemi-luminescence. A large number of substances, both inor-
ganic and organic, have been examined both by direct action of light
and by the action of cathode rays in a controllable vacuum tube
through which sparks from a powerful electric influence machine were
passed. Careful examination with appropriate reagents before and
after exposure was sufficient to determine whether any chemical change
had been produced. Thus the neutral chlorides of sodium and potas-
12? RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS.

sium, after being rendered luminous by action of cathode rays, are
thereby reduced to the condition of subchloride, so as to give a distinctly
alkaline reaction.

Many substances, moreover, which manifest no luminescence at
ordinary temperatures after exposure, or which do so for only a short
time, become distinctly luminescent when warmed. This striking phe-
nomenon is sufficient to warrant the use of a special name, thermo-
luminescence. Among such substances may be named the well-known
sulphides of the alkaline earths, the haloid salts of the alkali metals,
a series of salts of the zine and alkaline earth groups, various com-
pounds with aluminium, and various kinds of glass. Some of these
after exposure give intense colors when heated, even after the lapse of
days or weeks. That the vibratory motion corresponding to the
absorption of luminous energy should maintain itself for so long a time
as a mere physical process is highly improbable if not unparalleled.
That it should become locked in, to be subsequently evoked by warm-
ing, certainly indicates the storing of chemical energy, just as the
storage battery constitutes a chemical accumulator of electrical energy.
Other indications that luminescence is as much a chemical as a physical
phenomenon are found in the fact that the sudden solution of certain
substances is accompanied by the manifestation of light, if they have
been previously subjected to luminous radiation, but not otherwise;
that alteration of color is brought about by such exposure; and that
friction or crushing may cause momentary shining in such bodies as
sugar. There is no conclusive direct evidence thus far that such
luminescence as vanishes instantly upon the withdrawal of light is
accompanied by chemical action. But Becquerel demonstrated long
ago with his phosphoroscope that there is a measurable duration of
luminous effect when to the unaided eye the disappearance seems
instantaneous (Becquerel, Comptes rendus 96-121). Wiedemann now
shows that when this duration is considerable there is generally
chemical change. Since duration is only a relative term it seems
highly probable that even cases of instantaneous luminescence, com-
monly called fluorescence, are accompanied with chemical action on a
very minute scale, and that all luminescence is therefore jointly physi-
cal and chemical in character. We have thus color evoked by the
direct action of light, which disturbs the atomic equilibrium that
existed before exposure, and the manifestation of such color continues
only until the cessation of the chemical action thus brought into play.

The influence of very low temperature upon luminescence and pho-
tographic action has been studied by Dewar (Chemical News, LXX,
p. 252, 1894). The effect of light upon a photographic plate at the
temperature of liquid air —180° C. is reduced to only a fifth of what it
is at ordinary temperature; and at —200° the reduction is still greater,
while all other kinds of chemical action cease. Jn like manner, at —80°
calcium sulphide ceases to be luminescent; but, if illuminated at this
RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS. 123

low temperature and then warmed, it gives out light. At the tem-
perature of liquid air many substances manifest luminescence which
ordinarily seem almost incapable of it; such are gelatine, ivory, and
even pure water. <A crystal of ammonium platinocyanide, on the other
hand, when immersed in liquid air and illuminated by the electric
light, shines faintly when this is withdrawn. If now the liquid air be
poured off so that the crystal rises rapidly in temperature, it glows
brightly.

LUMINESCENCE AND PHOTOGRAPHY.

Photography, like luminescence, is a manifestation of the transfor-
mation of energy, most frequently of initial short wave length. The
production of color by photography is nothing new. It was noticed
by Seebeck nearly a century ago that silver chloride becomes tinted
by exposure to ordinary light, with accompanying chemical change;
that if then subjected a long time to red light it assumes a dull red
hue, or a dull bluish hue if held in blue light. It is likewise possible
by proper selection of luminescent salts to produce a selected series of
tints during and after exposure to those rays which are most effective
in photography. But such colors can not be made fixed and perma-
nent. The problem of securing on the photographic plate a faithful
and lasting reproduction of the various tints of a spectrum thrown
upon it has baffled most of those who grappled with this subject.
That it has been fully and quite satisfactorily solved can not yet be
affirmed, but the last few years have brought a far nearer approach to
success than an equal number of decades previously. Viewed from
the scientific standpoint the goal has certainly been touched, even if
commercial demands are still made in vain.

STATIONARY LIGHT WAVES.

Two quite different methods are to be considered in tracing the recent
development of this interesting application of optical principles. The
first is originally due to Becquerel (Am. de Chimie et de Physique (3),
p- 451, 1848), but lately, in the hands of Lippmann, it has been improved
and brought much nearer to success than by its originator. It depends
upon the production of stationary waves of light. Every one is famil-
lar with the formation of stationary waves upon an elastic stretched
cord, and with the acoustic exhibition of stationary air waves in a closed
tube by Kundt’s method of light powders. That similar loops and nodes
must be produced under proper conditions by interference of waves of
light would appear obviously possible; and so long ago as 1868 Dr.
Zenker (“‘ Lehrbuch der Photochromie,” Berlin, 1868) of Berlinexplained
the photographic reproduction of. color, so far as it had then been
accomplished, by reference to stationary light waves. But no definite
proof of their production has been brought ferward. <A few years ago
124 RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS.

Hertz demonstrated objectively the electromagnetic waves whose exist-
ence had been foretold by Maxwell’s genius; and with suitable appa-
ratus stationary electric waves are now almost as readily made evident
as are those of sound. Hertz’s brilliant success stimulated his fellow
countryman, Otto Wiener, to undertake the apparently hopeless task
of producing and studying stationary light waves. Wiener’s admirable
work (Wiedemann’s Annalen, Band XL, 1890, p.203) excited great inter-
est on the continent of Europe, but it has been singularly neglected in
England and America. It is worth much more than a passing notice.

Assume a plane silvered mirror upon which a bundle of rays of mono-
chromatic light fall normally so as to be reflected back upon its own
path. The superposition of reflected and direct waves causes a system
of stationary waves, but under ordinary conditions these are wholly
imperceptible. The nodes are formed upon a series of planes obviously
parallel to the reflecting plane at successive distances of a half wave
length. If now we consider a plane oblique to the mirror, it will cut
these successive nodal planes in parallel lines, whose distance apart
will be greater in proportion as the oblique plane approaches parallel-
ism to the mirror. Although a half wave length of violet light is only
one five-thousandth of a millimeter, it is easy to conceive of the cutting
plane forming so small an angle with the mirror that the distance
between the parallel nodal lines shall be a thousand times a half wave
length. Such would be the case if the inclination of the cutting plane
is reduced to a little less than four minutes of are. The nodal lines
would be one-fifth of a millimeter apart, and readily capable of resolu-
tion if their presence can be manifested at all. Imagine a very thin
transparent photographic film to be stretched along the oblique cutting
plane, and developed after exposure to violet light as nearly mono-
chromatic as possible. Then the developed negative should present a
succession of parallel clear and dark lines, corresponding to nodal and
antinodal bands along the oblique plane, the photographic effect being
annihilated along an opteal nodal line.

The realization of a photographic film thin enough for such an
experiment is quite conceivable when we remember that under the
hammer gold is beaten into leaves so delicate that 8,000 of them would
be required to make a pile 1 millimeter thick. By electrochemical
deposit, Outerbridge (Journal of the Franklin Institute, Vol. CITI,
p- 284, 1877) has made films of gold whose thickness is only one-hun-
dred-thousandth of a millimeter, or one-sixtieth of a wave length of
sodium light. Wiener obtained a perfectly transparent silver chloride
film of collodion, whose thickness was about one-thirtieth of a wave
length of sodium light. This was formed on a plate of glass and
inclined at a very small angle to a plane silvered mirror which served
as reflector. From an electric are lamp the light was sent through an
appropriate slit and prism, so that a selected spectral band of violet
fell normally on the prepared plate in the dark room. The developed
RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS. 125

negative presented the alternate bands, in perfectly regular order, more
than a half millimeter apart. Various tests were applied to guard
against error in interpretation, and the existence of such stationary
waves was proved beyond all doubt.

These waves, moreover, when polarized light was employed, furnished
the means of determining the direction of vibration with relation to the
plane in which the light is most copiously reflected when incident at
the polarizing angle, and thus of subjecting to experiment the question
as to whether the plane of vibration is coincident with this plane of
polarization or is perpendicular to it. The former of these views was
held by Neumann and MacCullagh, the latter by Fresnel. Let a beam
of polarized light fall upon the mirror at an angle of about 45°. If the
vibrations in the incident beam are parallel to the mirror, and hence
perpendicular to the plane of polarization, those of the reflected and
incident beams will be parallel to each other, and hence capable of inter-
ference. Butif the vibrations of the incident beams are in a plane ident-
ical with that of incidence, and hence in the plane of polarization, the
vibrations of incident and reflected beams are in mutually perpendic-
ular planes, and hence can not interfere. Wiener obtained interfer-
ence fringes when the light was polarized in the plane of incidence, while
the polarized in the plane perpendicular to this gave no trace of inter-
ference. The theory of Fresnel was thus confirmed experimentally.
Again, the familiar phenomenon of Newton’s rings shows us that on
changing media there is a change of phase of the incident light, else
the central spot where the two surfaces come into optical contact would
be white instead of black. But there has been difference of opinion
as to whether this change of phase occurs at the upper surface of the
air film, where the light passes from glass to less dense air, or at the
lower surface, where it passes from air to more dense glass. In the
latter event, there should be a node at the reflecting surface. Replac-
ing the silvered plane surface by a lens in contact with the photo-
graphic film, Wiener obtained circular fringes with no photographic
action, at the center, showing the nodal point to be at the point of
contact, and thus again confirming the theory of Fresnel.

COLOR PHOTOGRAPHY.

The conditions being now specified under which stationary light
waves are produced, let us imagine common instead of monochromatic
light to be transmitted normally through a transparent sensitive film.
Then a variety of stationary interference planes are produced. This
is the underlying principle of the process employed by Lippmann in
Paris, who, in 1892 (Comptes rendus, Tome CXIV, p. 961, and Tome
CXV, p. 575), succeeded in obtaining a photograph of the solar spec-
trum in naturalcolors. Upon a surface backed with a reflecting mirror

long and short period. After exposure and development the natural
colors are manifested with brilliancy. Apart from the fundamental
principle already expressed, it can scarcely be said that the rationale
of the process has yet been very fully and clearly explained. Lipp-
mann recognizes the stationary wave systems, with maxima and minima
of brightness in the film and corresponding maxima and minima of
silver deposit. If the incident light is homogeneous, a series of equi-
distant parallel planes of equal photographie efficiency are produced in
the film. If the plate after development is illuminated with white
light, then to every point within the film there comes from below a cer-
taih amount of reflected energy which is a continuous periodic function
of the distance from the reflecting surface. The total reflected light of
any color becomes then represented by the integral of this periodic
function for the entire thickness of the layer. The solution of this
integral brings the result that the intensity of the refieeted light
decreases with increasing thickness of the layer, approaching zero as
a limit, so long as this light is of different wave length from the homo-
geneous light employed for illumination of the plate. Only light of
the same wave length, or of an entire multiple of this, maintains a
finite value. A similar consideration applies to each of the hues com-
posing white light. By such mathematical considerations, Lippmann
(Journal de Physique, p. 97, 1894) reaches the conclusion that the light
reflected from the plate must have exactly the same relations of wave
length as that with which the plate was illuminated.

For the Lippmann photographs, which at first required a very long
exposure, and could even then be satisfactorily viewed at only a single
definite angle, it is now claimed that an exposure of only a few seconds
is needed, and that the colors are visible at all angles of incidence so
long as the plate is moist (Journal de Physique, p.84, 1894). But, like
the daguerreotypes of fifty years ago, they are incapable of multiplica-
tion, and, great as is the scientific interest connected with them, it
seems scarcely probable that they can long continue to hold an impor-
tant place practically. The problem of ascertaining definitely the cause
of the return of a color the same as that which falls upon a given sur-
face may seem to be solved mathematically, but the mastery of the
physical conditions required to produce a single colored negative, from
which may be had any desired number of positives with varied hues
accurately reproduced, is still in the future. From the very nature of
stationary light waves it does not appear probable that the Becquerel
method as improved by Lippmann will give the means of multiplying
copies of a single picture. Wiener has lately published an elaborate
research upon this subject (O. Wiener, Wiedemann’s Annalen, pp. 225-
281, June, 1895), in which he recognizes the necessity for the employ-
ment not of interference colors but rather of what he calls body colors
(K6érperfarben) due to chemical modification of the reflecting surface.

obtained a rose-colored form of silver photochloride which ‘in the violet
of the spectrum assumed a pure violet color, in the blue it acquired
a slate blue, in green and yellow a bleaching influence was shown, in
the red it remained unchanged.” But in the absence of any means
of fixing these colors. a promising prospect brings disappointment.

While it is abundantly possible that colored illumination upon suit-
able color-receptive materials can give rise to similar body colors, we
are still far from having these materials under control. There seems
at present to be greater promise in another and quite different applica-
tion of optical principles. The suggestion appears to have been first
named by Maxwell (Royal Institution lecture, May 17, 1861) in 1861
that photography in colors would be possible if sensitizing substances
were discovered, each sensitive to only a single primary color.

Three negatives might be obtained, one in each color; and three
complementary positives from these, when superposed and carefully
adjusted, would present a combination that includes all the colors of
nature. In 1873 H. W. Vogel in Berlin discovered that silver bromide,
by treatment with certain aniline dyes, notably eosine and cyanine
blue, can be made sensitive to waves of much longer period than those
hitherto effective in photography. In 1885 he proposed to sensitize
plates for each of a number of successive regions in the spectrum, and
to make aS many complementary pigment prints as negatives, which
should then be superimposed. This somewhat complicated plan proved
difficult in practice. In 1888 IF. EK. Ives (Journal of the Franklin Insti-
tute, January, 1889), of Philadelphia, adopting the more simple Helm-
holtz-Maxweil modification of Young’s theory of color, applied it to the
preparation of suitable compound color screens which were carefully
adjusted to secure correspondence with Maxwell’s intensity curves for
the primary colors. The result was a good reproduction of the solar
spectrum. But to reproduce the compound hues of nature it is neces-
sary specially to recognize the fact that although the spectrum is made
up of an infinite number of successive hues, the three color sensations
in the eye are most powerfully excited by combinations rather than by
simple spectral hues. Thus, according to Maxwell’s curves, the sensa-
tion of red is excited more strongly by the orange rays than by the
brightest red rays, but the green sensation is excited at the same time.
This fact has to be applied in the preparation of the negatives, while
images or prints from these must be made with colors that represent
only the primary color sensations. Properly selected color screens
must, therefore, be used for transmission of light to plates sensitized
with suitable aniline dyes, and the adjustment of ratios with this end
in view is not easy; but it has been successfully accomplished. From
three negatives thus made, each in its proper tint, positives are secured ;
and these are projected, each through its appropriate color screen, to
the same area upon a white screen. The addition of lights thus sent
from the triple lantern gives the original tints with great fidelity.
128 RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS.

Mr. Ives has devised a special form of camera by which the three
elementary negatives are taken simultaneously, and also an instrument,
the photochromoscope, in which a system of mirrors and Jenses brings
to the eye a combination similar to that projected with the triple lan-
tern. A double instrument of this kind forms the most perfect type
of stereoscope, bringing out with great vividness from the prepared
stereographs the combined effect of color, form, and binocular perspec- —
tive. It is only within the past year that these improvements have
been perfected. By further application of the same principles, Mr.
Ives has produced permanent colored prints on glass, which do not
require to be examined by the aid of any instrument. Each of these
negatives is made with a colored screen which transmits tints comple-
mentary to those which it is desired to reproduce. The three gelatine
films are soaked in aniline dyes of suitable tint and superimposed
between plates of glass. When viewed as a transparency, such a print
gives a faithful reproduction of the natural colors.

The problem of color reproduction is thus solved, not indeed so sim-
ply, but more effectively, than by the method of interference of light,
or by those body-color methods that have thus far been applied. To
the imaginative enthusiasts who are fond of repeating the once novel
information that “ electricity is still in its infancy,” it may be a source
of equal delight to believe that photography in colors, a yet more deli-
cate infant, is soon to take the place of that photography in light and
shade with which most of us have had to content ourselves thus far;
but so long as an instrument is needed to help in viewing chromograms,
the popular appreciation of these will be limited. We may take alesson
from the history of the stereoscope. Yet it is gratifying to recognize
the great impetus that this beautiful art has received during the last
few years. We may quite reasonably expect that the best is yet to
come, and that it will have an important place among the future appli-
cations of optical science.

THE INFRA-RED SPECTRUM.

Among the splendid optical discoveries of this century, probably the
most prominent are photography and spectrum analysis, each belonging
jointly to optics and chemistry. Photography was at first supposed to
be concerned only with the most refrangible rays of the spectrum, but
Abney and Rowland have photographed considerably below the visible
red. Beyond the range thus attained qualitative knowledge was
secured by Herschel, Becquerel, Draper, Melloni, Miiller, Tyndall, La-
mansky,and Mouton. But our quantitative knowledge of this region
began with the invention and use of the bolometer by Langley
(“Selective absorption of solar energy,” Am. Journal of Science, March,
1883, p. 169), whose solar energy curve has been familiar to all physicists
during the last dozen years. During this interval the bolometer has
been used with signal success by An gstrém, Rubens, Snow, and
RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS. : 129

Paschen, who have made improvements not only in the instrument itself
but in the delicacy of its necessary accompaninent, the galvanometer.
The work of Snow (Physical Review, Vol. I, pp. 28 and 95), particu-
larly, on the infra-red spectra of the voltaic are and of the alkalies, and
that done by him in conjunction with Rubens (Astronomy and Astro-
physics, March, 1893, p. 231), on refraction through rock salt, sylvite,
and fluorite, exhibited the capacities of the bolometer even better per-
haps than Langley’s previous work on the sun. But more recently
with the collaboration of several able assistants, and more particularly
the great ingenuity and mechanical skill of Wadsworth, the sensitive-
ness of Langley’s galvanometer has been so exalted, and the bolometer
connected in such manner with photographic apparatus as to make it
an automatically controlled system, by which an hour’s work now brings
results superior in both quantity and quality to what formerly required
many weeks or even months (Langley, ‘‘On recent researches in the
infra-red spectrum;” Report of Oxford meeting of British Association,
1894). Not only is an entire solar energy curve now easily obtained in
a single day, but even a succession of them. It becomes thus possible
by comparison to eliminate the effect of temporary disturbing condi-
tions, and to combine results in such a way as to represent the infra-
red cold bands almost as accurately as the absorption lines of the visi-
ble spectrum are indicated by use of the diffraction grating. It will
undoubtedly become possible to determine in large measure to what
extent these bands are due to atmospheric absorption, and which of
them are produced by absorption outside of the earth’s atmosphere.

With the diffraction grating, supplemented by the radiomicrometer,
Percival Lewis (Astrophysical Journal, June, 1895, p. 1, and August,
1895, p. 106), has recently investigated the infra-red spectra of sodium,
lithium, thallium, strontium, calcium, and silver, attaining results which
accord weil with the best previously attained by those who had
employed the bolometer, and which demonstrate the exceeding delicacy
of the radiomicrometer as an instrument of research.

THE VISIBLE SPECTRUM.

To follow out ail the applications of the spectroscope that have
resulted in recent additions to our knowiedge would carry us far
beyond the scope of a single paper. It is possible only to make brief
mention of a few.

For a number of years Rowland (ibid., January to August 1895) hais
been investigating the spectra of all the chemical elements, photo-
graphing them in connection with the normal solar spectrum, and
reducing them to his table of standards, which is now accepted every-
where. The work is of such magnitude that years more must elapse
before its completion. It now includes all wave lengths from 5,722 to
7,200, and of these the list already published extends as far as wave
lengths 5,150, or from ultra violet nearly to the middie of the green.

130 RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS.

Through the spectroscope chiefly has been established during the
present year the discovery of the new atmospheric element, argon, by
Lord Rayleigh and Professor Ramsay (Proc. Royal Society, January
31, 1895)'; its remarkable property of green fluorescence when the
electric spark is passed through it in presence of benzine, by Berthelot
and Deslandres (Comptes rendus, June 24, 1895); and its association
in meteoric iron and various minerals with helium, now proved to be a
terrestrial as well as solar element, by Ramsay (Nature, April 4, May
16, July 4-and 25, 1895), Crookes, Lockyer, and others.

With the diffraction spectroscope Rydberg (Wiedemann’s Annalen,
1893--1894) and Kayser and Runge (ibid., 1888-1895) have discovered
interesting relations among the spectral lines of a large number of
terrestrial elements, arranging them into series whose distribution
manifests chemical relationship quite analogous to that indicated in
Meudelejeff’s periodic law.

By photographing the spectrum of Saturn’s rings and noting the
relative displacement of the different parts of a spectral line, Keeler
(Astrophysical Journal, May 1895, p. 416) has obtained a beautiful
direct proof of the meteoric constitution of these rings, a confirmation
of the hypothesis put forth by Maxwell in 1859, that the outer portion
of the rings must revolve more slowly than the inner portion, and yet
not satisfy the conditions of fluidity. His work has been repeated
and confirmed by Campbell (ibid., August 1895, p. 127) at the Lick
Observatory.

The spectroheliograph devised by Hale (Astronomy and Astrophys-
ics, March, 1893, p. 256) has enabled him to photograph, on any bright
day, not only the solar photosphere and spots, but also the chromo-
sphere and protuberances. He has made some remarkable attempts
with this instrument to photograph the corona without an eclipse,
unsuccessfully thus far, but not without promise of future success.

POLARIZED LIGHT.

In the domain of polarized light, there have been several noteworthy
recent researches. Nichols and Snow (Philosophical Magazine (5),
Vol. XX XIII, p. 379) have shown that calcite, though readily trans-
parent for the brighter rays of the spectrum, rapidly diminishes in
power of transmission for waves of short period, so that for the extreme
violet this power is scarcely half so great as for the yellow. The
transmissive power of this crystal for the infra-red rays, between the
wave-length limits of 1 micron and 5.5 microns, has been investigated
with the bolometer by Merritt (Physical Review, May-June 1895, p.
494), who reaches the interesting result that the transmission curve for

the ordinary ray is wholly independeut of that for the extraordinary,
the absorption being in general much greater for the former. Several
sharp absorption bands are found for each ray. For radiations whose
wave-length exceeds 3.2 microns, the absorption of the ordinary ray is
almost complete, so that calcite behaves for such radiation just as
tourmaline does for the rays of the visible spectrum. The independ-
ence of the two transmission curves is found to exist also for quartz
and tourmaline, these curves for the latter crossing each other twice
in the infra-red region.

The application of polarized light to the investigation of internal
Stress in transparent media was made more than forty years ago by
Wertheim (Comptes rendus, 32, p. 289, 1851), who demonstrated that
the retardation of the rays is proportional to the load. An extended
series of such experiments has been lately made in America by Marston
(Physical Review, September, October, p. 127, 1893), who, besides con-
firming Wertheim’s conclusion, shows that, ‘‘for small strains at least,
the colors seen in a strained glass body, when polarized light is passed
through it in a direction parallel to one of the axes of strain, are
measured by the algebraic difference of the intensities of those two
principal strains whose directions are perpendicular to the direction of
the polarized light.”

A new substance with double rotatory power, like quartz, has been
discovered by Wyrouboff (Journal de Physique (3), 3, 452, 1894), the
neutral anhydrous tartrate of rubidium, which is unique in one respect.
The rotatory power of the substance in the crystalline state becomes
reversed in solution. This wholly new phenomenon introduces some
perplexity in connection with certain molecular theories that have been
formulated to account for double rotatory power.

Crehore (Transactions of the American Institute of Electrical Engi-
neers, October, 1894, p. 91) has ingeniously applied Faraday’s principle
of electro-magnetic rotation of the plane of polarization in carbon
bisulphide to the photographing of alternate current curves. Every
variation in the magnetic field causes variation in the amount of light
transmitted through a pair of crossed Nicol prisms. The combination
becomes a chronograph with an index as free from inertia as the beam
reflected from a galvanometer mirror. The same instrument has been
applied to measurement of the velocity of projectiles (Journal of the
United States Artillery, p. 409, July, 1895), with results of exceeding
interest to the student of gunnery.

PHYSIOLOGICAL OPTICS.

The temptation to dilate upon recent progress in physiological optics
has to be resisted. The revision of Helmholtz’s great book on this
subject was interrupted by the death of the distinguished author, but
the last part is now approaching completion under the care of his
pupil, Arthur Konig, who, in conjunction with Diederici, has done
ia RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS.

much important work in this domain. The selection of hues for the
three primary color sensations has been slightly modified. Young
selected the two extremes of the spectrum, red and violet, together
with green, which is about midway between them. The hues now
accepted by Helmholtz and those who follow his lead, including the
great majority of physicists, are a highly saturated carmine red, an
equally saturated ultramarine blue, and a yellowish green, correspond-
ing somewhat to that of vegetation. The red and blue agree with
those previously determined by Hering, but the rivalry between the
two schools on the subject of color sensation continues, and perhaps
will last through a period commensurate with the difficulty of devising
crucial experiments.

Independent theories of color sensation have been brought out by
Mrs. Franklin (Christine Ladd Franklin, ‘‘Kine neue Theorie der
Lichtempfundungen,” Zeitschrift fiir Psychologie und Physiologie der
Sinnesorgane, 1892), in America, and by Ebbinghaus (‘‘Theorie des
Farbensehens,” ibid., 1893), in Germany. The former particularly is
worthy of much more extended notice than can here be given. It may
perhaps be quite properly called a chemical theory of vision. Light is
always bringing about chemical changes in external objects, and the
eye is the one organ whose exercise requires the action of light, while
such chemical action is implied in the performance of most of the
bodily functions, such as the assimilation of food and the oxidation of
the blood. The bleaching action of light upon the visual purple, which
is continually formed on the retina, has been known ever since the
discovery of this in 1877 by Kiihne, who secured evanescent retinal
photographs in the eyes of rabbits. Mrs. Franklin considers that light
sensation is the outcome of photochemical dissociation of two kinds of
retinal molecules that she denominates gray molecules and color mole-
cules, of which the latter arise from the gray molecules by differentia-
tion in such a way that the atoms of the outer layer group themselves
differently in three directions, and the corresponding action of light
of proper wave length gives rise to the three fundamental color sensa-
tions. She develops the theory with much skill, applying it particu-
larly to the phenomena of retinal fatigue and color blindness. To the
objection that there is no direct proof of the existence of the assumed
gray and color molecules, it may be answered that Helmboltz himself
fully recognized the uncertainty of the assumption that three different
sets of nerves respond to the three fundamental color sensations, and
he admitted that these may be only different activities In the same
retinal cone. ‘The supposition of three adjacent cones, responding
respectively to the three fundamental sensations, is made only for the
sake of greater convenience in discussion.

Indeed, there is still much for us to learn regarding the nature of
color sensation. Among the yet unexplained phenomena are those of
simultaneous color contrast. The fact that a small brightly colored
RECENT PROGRESS IN OPTICS. oor

area on a gray background appears surrounded by its complementary
tint is familiar enough. For its explanation it has been common to
assume that there is unconscious motion of. the observer’s eyes, incip-
ient retinal fatigue, an error of judgment, or fluctuation of judgment.
This has been tested by A. M. Mayer (American Journal of Science,
July, 1893), who ingeniously devised methods for showing these con-
trast phenomena on surfaces large enough to match the colors with
those of rotating color disks, and thus to arrive at quantitative state-
ments of their hues. When viewed through a small opening in a
revolving disk, the subjective contrast color was unmistakably percep-
tible when the duration of passage of the opening was less than one-
thousandth of a second. The same effect was obtained in a dark room
with instantaneous illumination of the colored surface by the strong
spark of an electric influence machine. The duration of illumination is
thus almost infinitesimal, certainly not more than one ten-millionth of a
second. The hypothesis of fluctuation of judgment is thus shown to be
wholly untenable. I have performed most of these experiments, either
with Professor Mayer or separately, and my testimony can therefore
be united with his. The case is quite analogous to that of the pereep-
tion of binocular relief, which was once explained as the product of a
judgment, but was found to be always possible with instantaneous
Ulumination. Professor Mayer has devised a disk photometer based
on color contrast, with which the error of a single reading was found
much less than with the Bunsen photometer.

The rotating color disk has been applied by O. N. Rood (American
Journal of Science, September, 1893) to the determination of luminosity
independently of color, by taking advantage of the flickering appear-
ance on a rotating disk upon which two parts have different reflecting
powers. An extreme case of this is that of a white sector upon a black
disk. Ata certain critical speed the retinal shock due to momentary
impression by white light becomes analyzed into the subjective impres-
sion of spectral colors, the duration of the retinal sensation varying
with the wave length of the incident light. The law of this variation
has been studied by Plateau (‘‘ Dissertation sur quelques propricétés des
impressions produits par la lumiere sur l’organe de la vue,” Liege, 1829),
Nichols (American Journal of Science, October, 1884), and more
recently with much precision by Ferry (ibid., September, 1892), who
showed that retinal persistence varies inversely as the logarithm of the
luminosity. For a given source of light separated into its spectral
components, the yellow is the brightest. For this hue accordingly the
retinal impression is shortest, and for violet it is longest.

Under appropriate conditions the after-effect on the retina has a cer-
tain pulsatory character, as first noted by C. A. Young (Philosophical
Magazine, Vol. XLIII, p. 543, 1872) in 1872, and carefully studied
within the last few years by Charpentier (‘Oscillations rétiniennes,”
Comptes rendus, Vol. CXIII, p. 147, 1891) in France, and Shelford

Bidwell (‘On the recurrent images following visual impressions,” Proc.
Royal Society, March 27, 1894) in England. A disk with properly
arranged black and white sectors, if brightly illuminated and looked at
while revolving at a moderate rate, becomes apparently colored, just as
a momentary glance at the sun causes the perception of a succession
of subjective spectral hues which may last a number of seconds. The
phenomenon in relation to the disk was known as early as 1838 (Fech-
ner, Poggendorff’s Annalen, 1838), and explained by Rood (American
Journal of Science, September, 1860) in 1860. The rediscovery of
what has been long forgotten arouses all the interest of novelty. The
‘artificial spectrum top,” devised by Benham (Nature, November 29,
1894, p. 113) last autumn, excited interest on two continents, and was
promptly copyrighted by a prominent firm of opticians (ibid., March
14, 1895, p. 463) in England. It would perhaps be equally enterprising
to copyright the solar spectrum.

The limits of a single address forbid my touching upon the large
and practically important subject of color blindness. Indeed, in both
physieal and physiological optics much has been omitted that is abun.
dantly worthy of attention. In behalf of my hearers it may be wise to
take heed, once more, of the fate of Tarpeia, who was overwhelmed
with the abundance of her reward.

INTRODUCTION.

A great chemist, J. B. Dumas, once said that living organisms are
nothing but “condensed air.” He thus expressed, in terse terms, the
result of the investigations pursued by himself and others into the
relations of the atmosphere to living beings.

My purpose, in the following pages, is to show how closely Dumas’s
statement agrees with ascertained facts, even more closely than he
himself supposed. It is also desirable to briefly instance and illustrate
the varied ways in which air influences the general life of the globe.
If the ordinary definition of the word were not an impediment to its
use in the present case, I would say that I purpose making a general
sketch of the “‘ biology” of the atmosphere. More exactly and appro-
priately I may use a quite similar term, and say that the subject-
matter of this essay is the “natural history” of the air—taking the
term in the sense given to it by Geoffroy St. Hilaire—an essay upon
the properties of air considered in its relations to living beings, upon
its composition, its contents, its origin, its varied modes of action.

While I shall especially and particularly consider air in its relations
to life, I shall also refer briefly to its relations to other subjects, point-
ing out those which it would be useful to investigate further in order
to increase the scope of our knowledge.

The study of the atmosphere is truly one of great magnitude; ‘its
relations to the remainder of the universe are so varied and impor-
tant, the subjects which it suggests are so numerous and take us through
so many fields of inquiry, that a comparison suggests itself forcibly—
just as the atmosphere surrounds our whole planet and forces itself
into the clefts and fissures between its elements and rocks to the depths
of the soil, in the same manner does the study of air pertain to all
departments of science, to geology as well as astronomy, to physics no
less than to chemistry, and to biology in the largest sense of the term

While it would be a hazardous enterprise to undertake a complete
review of so important a subject, it may prove useful to give a rapid
sketch of some features, and that I shall endeavor to do, by showing
what air is, physically and chemically considered, what is its origin,
what it contains, and of what use it is to life. Doubtless this is but

a small part of the subject, but this sketch may contribute to show
how vast and varied is that chapter of science that goes under the
name of the “study of the atmosphere.”

I.—AIR CONSIDERED FROM THE PHYSICAL POINT OF VIEW.

Vast as are the proportions of the atmosphere it is none the less invis-
ible. It surrounds us on every side; we are bathed in it, and we do
not see it; when it is not in motion we do not feel it. Although having
material existence and creating material effects, for evil or for good, it
is immaterial to our senses. This fluid, this gas, may, however, be
weighed. Jean Rey' and Otto von Guericke? were the first who gave
positive proot of this, and showed that a glass receiver in which a
vacuum had been made—even imperfectly—weighed less than the same
receiver in normal and free connection with the surrounding atmos-
phere—that is, full of air—and, on the other hand, a receiver into which
air is forced and maintained under pressure weighs more than the
same receiver full of air at the normal pressure pro loco et tempore.
One liter of air, pure and dry, under the pressure of 760 millimeters,
at 0° temperature, and at the latitude of Paris, weighs 1.293 grams
(Regnault). It weighs more if the pressure is higher, less if it is
lower; and hence a liter of air has more weight at the bottom of a
shaft in a mine than at sea level, and less on top of a hill or moun-
tain. The higher the altitude at which air is weighed the less it
weighs, because it expands, the same weight of air occupying a larger
space or volume. Air is more dense at low stations, less dense in the
higher strata of the atmosphere, so that when the weight of air is men-
ticned it is always given with reference to a certain altitude, to a cer-
tain pressure, and also to acertain temperature and hygrometrie state,
because these different conditions exert a considerable infiuence upon
the matter.

As 1n the case of other gases, air is made up of molecules, and these
are considered as being in a state of perpetual motion. It has been
reckoned that the number of impacts or collisions to which each mole-
cule is subjected during each second. in the tremendous turmoil which
takes place in the air, amounts to something like 4,700,000,000! These
molecules are exceedingly small, and Sir William Thomson (Lord
Kelvin), Clerk Maxwell, and Van de Waals give their dimensions as
being less than a fraction of one-millionth of a millimeter, 1 cubic cen-
timeter of air, at 0° and 760 millimeters pressure, containing, in round
numbers, some 21,000,000,000,000,000.000 of these molecules.

I have referred to the fact that the weight of the air is not the same
in all localities. It also varies in the same locality. The sum total of

1Jean Rey, French physician and physicist, said, in 1630, that if tin is burnf in
contact with air, it increases in weight, and this increase is due to air which has
been absorbed by the metal during the combustion.

2 Otto von Guericke, born 1602, died 1686. He also demonstrated atmospheric pres-
sure by means of the instrument called the Magdeburg hemispheres—two hollow
hemispherical cups which it is very difficult to separate when a vacuum has been
created in the interior.
AIR AND LIFE. 139

the weight of the atmosphere, wherever considered, varies every day
more or less, often appreciably within the limits of a few hours and
even minutes. This could not happen, of course, if the weight of the
strata of air did not vary also. The weight of the whole atmosphere
increases or decreases because the weight of the air, considered at
any region vertically above the point where the observation is made,
increases or decreases. These variations of weight, or pressure, are
indicated by the barometer—devised in 1643 by Torricelli, pupil and
friend of Galileo—and the oscillations of that instrument are only indi-
cations of the differences of the weight or pressure of the air.

Now, as the pressure is increased at low stations, and diminished at
high ones, and, as there is a very definite and regular connection between
differences of altitude and barometrical indications, it is conceivable
that the barometer may, to some extent, and with certain limitations,
yield information as to the altitude at which an observer finds himself.
It is sufficient to mention the fact; the methods by which it is estab-
lished would require too long an exposition.

Since air is material and has a weight of its own, however varia-
ble, if must press upon all organisms. If is not difficult to estimate
with some precision the weight of the superincumbent air. Tor each
Square centimeter of our skin, the pressure exerted is exactly that
of a vertical column of mercury 1 square centimeter in section, and
of the same height as the barometrical column at that moment. If
the barometer stands at 760 inillimeters, the pressure is exactly that
of 76 cubie centimeters of mercury, and as each cubie centimeter
weighs 13.6 grams, the sum total, per square centimeter, is 1 kilo-
gram 33 grams, or about 15 pounds per square inch. Taking the skin
surface of the average adult to be something like 15 square meters
(15,000 square centimeters), the weight with which the atmosphere
presses on each of us amounts to 15,450 kilograms; but under ordi-
nary circumstances we do not feel this enormous load, because the
pressure is exerted in al] directions; from within outward as well
as from without inward, from below upward as well as from above
downward. To perceive this pressure, it must be removed from one
side, as when the hand is placed over the open end of a cylinder in
which a vacuum is being formed; then one feeis the strong pressure
pushing the hand toward the opposite end of the cylinder. Of course
the pressure exerted upon the body and all objects, is lessened as
the altitude increases, or the barometer falls; and, reciprocally, if the
barometer rises, or if the body be at a low station—in a mine for
instance—the pressure is higher. The total weight of the atmosphere,
at sea level, under normal circumstances, averages some 5,000,000,-
000,000,000,000 kilograms—that is, the millionth of the weight of our
planet itself; or, to use other terms, the weight of a continuous
Stratum of mercury 76 centimeters high, and covering the entire sur-
face of the globe, both sea and land. This is a fairly high figure for a
140 AIR AND LIFE.

substance so nearly immaterial that it escapes our vision. However,
air is not always invisible; it may be seen very clearly; it may also be
touched and handled, although no one would undertake to do so, or to
recommend the feat. Whilst it is gaseous under normal pressure and

circumstances, it may be made to assume the liquid form when subjected .

simultaneously to the influence of considerable cold and very high pres-
sure. High pressure alone is not sufficient. Undera pressure of 3,000
atmospheres, 3,000 times that of ordinary sea-level pressure, oxygen
and nitrogen remain gases (Natterer); but if at the same time the
temperature is lowered, they immediately assume the liquid condition.
MM. Cailletet and Pictet have obtained liquid air by means of pressures
of 300, 500, or 1,000 atmospheres cooperating with intense cold, with the
cold corresponding to 100° or 200° below zero (Celsius or centigrade).
Under such circumstances air may even assume the solid form; the
liquid air freezes into a solid block.!

No one could venture to touch this liquid or solid with the bare skin,
for two reasons; one being that, of course, air can be kept liquid or
solid only under the circumstances of its production, and instantly
becomes a gas under normal pressure or temperature; the other, that,
even if the transformation were not instantaneous, the intense absorp-
tion of heat (production of cold) which accompanies the passage from
the liquid or solid to the gaseous state would be more than sufficient
to kill instantly all living tissues in the vicinity.

It is enough for our present purpose to simply mention the impor-.

tance of air as an elastic fluid, and the part played by this gas in
luminous, thermic, acoustic, and electric phenomena, where it is an all-
important medium. It is also sufficient to remind the reader of the
temperature of the atmosphere and its varied movements, from the
light breeze that cools the hot summer days to the cyclones and
tornadoes which destroy buildings and tear up the strongest giants
of the forests. Lastly, the atmosphere is very far from being unlimited.
It ceases at some distance from our planet, becoming very thin and rare
even at altitudes that are not exceedingly great, such as 5,000 meters
(Mont Blane, 4,813 meters; Gaurisankar 8,840 meters), and while we
are not prepared to state the exact distance from the earth at which
all traces of air disappear, it is generally admitted that above 320 or
309 kilometers (1 kilometer=1,000 meters) height, vertically, there is
no atmosphere worth mentioning. Of course, at such altitudes, the air
must be exceedingly thin and rarefied, asit is in the exhausted receiver
of the air pump.

It is commonly said that air is tasteless and odorless. Pure air

‘The gas is first cooled down to 30° below zero, and then compressed under 200 or
300 atmospheres. It remains fluid; but if a small amount of it is then allowed to
escape, the sudden expansion—which is accompanied by a production of cold, while
compression causes heat to be evolyed—cools down the remainder of the air, the
temperature falls to 200° below zero, and the air immediately assumes the liquid con-
dition. Lower down it freezes and becomes a solid block.

AIR AND LIFE. 141

may be unable to affect the olfactory membrane; but this is not the case
with the atmosphere generally. The air that surrounds us is full of
scents and odors, but we are so accustomed to them that we take no
notice thereof. But after we have spent some time in an atmosphere
where most ordinary odors can not conveniently gain access, and then
return to our ordinary surroundings, the case is altered, and we perceive
a very powerful odor. This has been noticed by different observers
after a considerable sojourn in deep caves, such as the Mammoth Cave
in Kentucky. The air in these caves is nearly odorless, and when,
after a few hours spent in this scentless environment, the visitor
emerges again into the open, the atmosphere seems powerfully, even
violently, scented or odoriferous, and some persons may even be tempo-
rarily affected by the intensity of the sensation. During the sojourn
in the unscented air the olfactory cells have rested, but the renewal
of their activity, generally unconscious, is accompanied by a very strong
sensation which however soon fades.

The atmosphere does not stop at the surface of the seas, nor does it
cease at the surface of the soil. It penetrates both, the former espe-
cially. In the latter the access of air is very soon arrested by the
compactness of the rocks or strata, and, generally speaking, the pro-
portion of air in the soil is very small in all cases where there are no
clefts, fissures, or deep underground galleries. In the superficial layer,
however, the case is different; airis always present in appreciable pro-
portions in the less compact parts where plants push their roots and
seek their nutriment; and in the deepest shafts, caverns, caves, and
other natural or artificial excavations of the soil, air exists. It should
not be expected to find there as pure a gas as that which surrounds the
exterior of the planet. In the soil many slow but continuous chemical
reactions are going on between the air and the solid constituents, and
the result is an alteration of both sets of elements; some chemicals of
the earth and rocks are transformed, and while the air loses some part
of its constituents new elements are added to it, and thus its normal
composition is soon altered. This is the reason why great care should
alivays be exercised to ascertain the condition of air in all deep cavi-
ties, and even in normal excavations if they are rather secluded. The
air may have been so much altered in its composition as to have be-
come unfit for the maintenance of life, and cases are on record where
it consisted almost entirely of carbonic acid. Among the investigators
who have specially concerned themselves with the chemical composi-
tion of “ground” air, Boussingault has obtained interesting results,
showing that while 1 cubic meter of normal atmosphere contains
about 4 deciliters (or 0.216 gram) of carbon, 1 cubic meter of ground
air contains 9 liters (or nearly 5 grams), which is twenty-two or twenty-
three times more. In recently manured soil the proportion is much
more considerable, and the amount of carbonie acid may be twenty-
four times as great as in atmospheric air. This considerable amount

142 . AIR AND LIFE.

of carbonic acid in ground air fully explains a number of accidents,
inasmuch as while the proportion of this gas is considerably increased
that of oxygen is greatly diminished.

Air penetrates to a great depth in water, whether fresh or salt. This
is shown by the number of living forms found, not only at the surface
or in its neighborhood, but at the greatest depths to which man has
yet been abie to lower his nets, dredges, and sounding apparatus.
Since living organisms exist in the depths of the ocean, and since
they are physiologically, in their most important features, constructed
on the same principles as those which live near the surface, it is obvi-
ous that in the waters of the deep, air must be dissolved of which they
take advantage for their respiratory functions. Direct and precise
observation fully confirms this inductive reasoning. Many instruments
have been devised for the purpose of obtaining water from different
depths. One of the first was the bottle, which was used by the Kiel
committee. This bottle, firmly stopped and empty, was lowered to the
required depth, and a sudden pull was enough to cause it to open, the
surrounding water filling it in a few seconds. Many similar imple-
ments have been since invented by Bunsen, Meyer, Mill, Buchanan
(Challenger), Ellman, Sigsbee (Blake), Richard, Villegente, and Paul
Regnard. The description of these instruments is given at length in
many works—for instance, in T. Thoulet’s Océanographie ( Vol. 1), Paris,
1890, and P. Regnard’s La vie dans les eaux, Paris, 1891—where the
reader who desires full information on the matter may find it, and it
will saffice fur our purpose to give a general summary of the results
obtained, without detailing the methods by which water is brought to
the surface from different depths, or those, familiar to all, by which
the gases contained in water are extracted and submitted to chemical
analysis. In short, the results of these experiments fully and com-
pletely confirm the opinion above expressed, that even at the greatest
depths water does contain air; that the atmosphere extends down to
the nearly unfathomable abysses of the ocean.

As to rivers and lakes, or other shallow waters, the demonstration is
most easy. Their water contains oxygen, nitrogen, and carbonic acid.
But it is a noteworthy fact that these gases are not to be found in the
proportions in which they exist in the atmosphere. Strictly speaking,
one can not say that there is any air in water. What we find are the
elements of air, the latter being all present, but their proportions
being different from those in the normal atmosphere. For instance, 1
liter of river water contains from 4 to 8 cubic centimeters of oxygen;
from 12 to 18 eubice centimeters of nitrogen, and from 2 to 20 or 25 cubic
centimeters of carbonic acid. These proportions differ greatly from
those which these three constituents have in normal air, and it must be
noted that the variations are different in different rivers or even in
the same river when examined in different places. Take the Seine
River, for instance. Each liter of water contains 32.1 cubic centimeters
AIR AND LIFE. 143

of gas, of which 3.9 are oxygen, 12 nitrogen, and 16.2 are carbonic acid.
Take the Rhone River, on the other hand, and you find 34.8 cubic centi-
meters of gas, of which 8.4 are oxygen, 18.4 nitrogen, and 8 carbonic acid.
These differences are less surprising after reflection. Each river may
and does differ in chemical constitution from other rivers, and even
from itself, at different times and places, because of the difference in
the nature and quantity of the chemical operations going on in the
water. The chemical composition of the banks varies, and the activity
of living organisms within the waters also varies. Such differences
must exert their influence upon the chemical composition of the latter,
and we have abundant proof that they do so. If the water of the same
river, taken at different places at the saine moment, is tested chemically,
differences are observed which are sometimes considerable. For in-
stance, the Thames, above London, contains 7.4 oxygen, at Hammer-
smith 4.7, at Somerset House 1.5, at Woolwich 0.25. Whence arise
these considerable variations? They are easily explained by the fact
that the river receives a large quantity of organic débris, vegetables,
dead animals, and a large number of dead or dying substances or
organisms; the débris combines with oxygen, and thus the amount of
this gas is greatly diminished. The consequence is that the fish often
perish through asphyxia, the amount of oxygen being inadequate. The
same occurs in Paris. After its passage through. the city, the Seine
is generally quite unfit to support the life of most aquatic animals.
Many species are not to be seen in the river at Paris, nor below it for
some distance, although found above, where the water is sufficiently
pure and aerated, and some 10 or 20 miles below, where aeration has
been sufficient to make up for the loss, the water having absorbed
enough fresh oxygen from the atmosphere.

So much for one series of differences in aeration. But another series
exists which is even of greater interest. The aeration of waters, or
the absorption of gases by water, varies according to general external
conditions, among which temperature and pressure rank highest—not
only general pressure, but, so to speak, individual pressure, or, to put
it in other terms, the proportion of any given gas ina mixture. Under
identical conditions, each gas, moreover, has its own special coefficient
of solubility. While nitrogen is feebly soluble, ammonia is highly so.
This fact helps us to understand why it is that the gases which
spontaneously dissolve in water in contact with the atmosphere do not,
when extracted from the water, yield a mixture even distantly compa-
rable to air: how itis that the elements of air are not found in water
under the proportions they bear to each other in the atmosphere.
While water contains the constituents of air, it contains such propor-
tions of these constituents as are peculiar to it. However, the latter
are provided in sufficient quantity, and normal river water is quite
adequate to maintain the life of aquatic animals. This applies to fresh
waters generally, for ponds and lakes have the same conditions as
rivers.
144 AIR AND LIFE.

Some special points are to be noted concerning salt water. Of course
the constituents of atmospheric air are met with in sea water. But,
generally speaking, the variations in the proportions of these constit-
uents are less numerous and of less importance. The seas, generally
considered, make up amore homogeneous whole than any river of large
dimensions. Between the south Atlantic and the north Atlantic less
